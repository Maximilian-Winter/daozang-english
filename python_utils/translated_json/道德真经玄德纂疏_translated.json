  "full_translation": "**The Profound Virtue Commentary on the Dao De Jing (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue)**\n\n**Title of the Scripture:** *The Dao De Jing (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue) with Profound Virtue Commentary*.\n\n**Strong Contemplation and Profound Reverence**—twenty volumes. The original source: *The Zhengtong Daozang (Orthodox Daoist Canon)* under the *Dongshen (Cavernous Spirits)* section, *Yujue (Jade Precepts)* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Profound Virtue Commentary on the Dao De Jing**\n\nThe Dao is supreme and without form, yet it gives rise to wondrous existence.\nIt governs the boundless Dao, fulfilling the marvelous function of existence—\nwho else but the **Most High Sage-Laozi, the Primordial Emperor**?\n\nEmerging from the **Symbolic Age** (象先), revered as the **Origin of Transformation** (化本),\nHe was the first to fuse the divine essence at the dawn of countless kalpas,\nHis spirit divided to permeate the heavens and earth, nurturing all beings,\nMolding myriad forms, and refining all things.\nThus, the **Three Sovereigns** received their mandate,\nStill adhering to the **Pure Unity** (淳一) of ancient virtue,\nAnd the **Five Emperors** held the **Sacred Maps** (图),\nGradually dispersing the **Uncarved Simplicity** (无为之朴) of the Dao.\n\nThough **Sage-Laozi** descended through the ages,\nAdapting to each era’s needs—\nSometimes as a **national preceptor** (国师),\nSometimes as a **guest of honor** (宾友),\nTeaching scriptures and transmitting the Dao,\nTo instruct the rulers of his time—\nAt the outset of the **Tang and Yu’s abdication** (唐虞禅让),\nWhen the **Way of the world was in decline** (世道交丧),\nHe raised the **Primordial Virtue** (元凯) in the wilderness,\nAnd practiced the **Four Offenses** (四罪) in court,\nThe **Veneration of Worthies** (尚贤) was manifest,\nYet the **Age of Corruption** (瘴恶) also emerged.\nThough inner harmony was upheld,\nOuter strife persisted—\nHuman hearts grew cold,\nThe **Uncarved Simplicity** of the Dao faded like mist.\n\n**Sage-Laozi**, named **Yin Shouzi** (尹寿子),\nDwelling in **Helyang** (河阳),\nPitying the **erring nature of beings** (物性之迁讹),\nFearful that the **true teaching would be abandoned** (真宗之陵替),\nDeemed that the **Great Scriptures of the Three Sovereigns** (三皇大字) were insufficient\nTo guide the **future kings** (后王),\nAnd the **constant Way of the Five Emperors** (五帝常道) could not\nInstruct the **later generations** (末俗).\nThus, he condensed the **profound and mysterious essence** (玄奥义),\nComposing the *Dao De* in **two chapters**.\nHe sought to elucidate the **Dao’s non-action** (无为),\nUsing **virtue** (德) to reveal it—\n**Virtue** has practical application,\nThe **Dao** clarifies its meaning.\n\nHe employed **spoken words** (立言) to express the **ineffable** (无言),\nUsing **principle** (理本) to expound the **mysterious origin** (妙本),\nEstablishing the **foundation for governance and self-cultivation** (理身理国之要),\nAs the **ultimate and most refined teaching** (至精至极之宗),\nAnd bestowed it upon **Shun**.\nNot that he rejected **benevolence, righteousness, sagely wisdom, and intelligence** (仁义圣智),\nBut rather, he tempered **excessive passion, deceit, and sharp cleverness** (浇诈聪明),\nTo guide the **sovereign to rule, ministers to serve, fathers to lead, and children to obey** (君君臣臣父父子子),\nSo they might **embrace the Uncarved and return to simplicity** (见素抱朴),\nMerge with the **Great Harmony** (太和),\nAnd thus naturally attain **loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝).\n\nThe **common scholars** (世儒) do not comprehend,\nAssuming that **Sage-Laozi’s Dao** (老君之道) abandons\n**Benevolence and righteousness** (仁义),\nAnd **overthrows ritual and wisdom** (隳礼智),\nThis is not the **great principle of his teaching** (立教之大方).\n\nMoreover, **supreme benevolence** (至仁) aligns with the **harmonious virtue of heaven and earth** (天地之德),\n**Supreme righteousness** (至义) conforms to the **natural order of heaven and earth** (天地之宜),\n**Supreme joy** (至乐) resonates with the **harmony of heaven and earth** (天地之和),\n**Supreme propriety** (至礼) follows the **rhythms of heaven and earth** (天地之节),\n**Supreme wisdom** (至智) discerns the **distinctions of heaven and earth** (天地之辨),\n**Supreme trust** (至信) attunes to the **timing of heaven and earth** (天地之时).\nIt broadens the **source of Pure Unity** (淳一之源),\nAchieves the **transformation of Great Unity** (大同之化),\nBlends with the **supreme Dao** (混合至道),\nAnd returns to the **Land of Benevolent Longevity** (归仁寿之乡).\nIt is not merely about **affected gestures or hollow rhetoric** (踶跂雍容，噢咻蹩趸),\nBut rather, it is **true benevolence and righteousness** (仁义等).\n\nThus, the **Sages Zhongni and Ya** (仲尼亚圣) all attained it in silence,\nDiscarding **cleverness** (黜聪) and **bodily form** (遗形),\nTranscending the **material realm** (超乎物表),\nAnd becoming **true immortals** (永为真人).\nThis is beyond the understanding of **petty scholars and minor literati** (末学小儒).\n\nFrom the **Xia, Shang, Zhou, and Han dynasties** (绵夏商周汉),\nSpanning thousands of years,\nIts brilliance rivaled the **sun and moon** (与日月齐光),\nIts majesty matched the **heavens and earth** (与乾坤并运).\nThough **a hundred schools** (百家) have interpreted and annotated it,\nAnd **numerous scholars** (群彦) have refined and elucidated it,\nThe more one draws from it, the deeper it becomes,\nThe more one tastes of it, the inexhaustible it is.\nWhen applied to **governance**, punishments are set aside,\nAnd **Great Peace** (太平) prevails.\nWhen practiced in **self-cultivation**, the **spirit is preserved** (神全),\nAnd **longevity is attained** (久视).\n\n**Patting the table and brandishing the brush** (拊几挥柄),\nThere have always been those who embody its truth.\n\n**Strong Contemplation (Strong Thinking)**, **Montang’s Qi Muyue** (强思齐，字默越),\nA native of **Montang** (蒙阳),\nFrom youth grasped the **Mysterious Passages** (玄关),\nEarly explored the **profound meanings** (妙旨),\nAttending the **Golden Immortal Observatory** (京金仙观) each year,\nDiscussing the **Great Virtue** (大德) with his master,\nHonored as a **Purple-Clad True Immortal** (赐紫全真),\nResiding in the **Middle Palace of the Ge Immortal** (葛仙中宫),\nAfter reciting scriptures, he **diligently served** (服勤不息),\nHis reputation flourishing,\nPraised by his contemporaries.\n\nWhen **Emperor Lizong** (僖宗皇帝) **responded to the auspicious signs** (顺动六飞),\nAnd **halted his journey in the Three Shu regions** (驻跸三蜀),\nIn the **fifth month**, observing the **Celestial Festival** (应天节),\n**Qi Muyue** composed a **prayer of longevity** (祝寿行殿),\nAnd was **granted purple robes** (宠赐紫衣).\n\nWhen **Emperor Gaozu** (高祖神武皇帝) **responded to the Heavenly Mandate** (应历开图),\nAnd **aligned with the Celestial Pole** (配天立极),\nIn the **second month**, celebrating the **Spring Festival of Longevity** (寿春节),\nHe **received the clear command** (允承明命),\nAnd bestowed the title **Profound Virtue Grandmaster** (玄德大师) upon him.\nFor generations, his **mind dwelled in the Dao** (栖心),\nAll were **granted radiant favor** (洽光宠),\nHis **feathered robes symbolized simplicity** (羽衣象简),\nAnd his **virtue was unparalleled** (其何盛欤).\n\nWhenever he **delved into the profound mysteries** (探讨幽玄),\nAnd **expounded upon common understanding** (发挥流俗),\nHe aimed to **repay the sage’s grace** (报圣明之恩)\nWith the **power of his lectures** (谭讲之力).\n\nIn his **lectures on the *Dao De* in two chapters**,\nHe selected the **best interpretations of all schools** (采诸家之善者),\nTaking **Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary** (皇《御注》) as the foundation,\nChoosing **concise yet comprehensive expressions** (文约而义该),\n**Swift yet logically sound words** (词捷而理当),\nCompiling them into **twenty volumes** (勒成二十卷),\nSo that it might be **easily grasped** (揽之易晓),\nAnd **endlessly transmitted** (传之无穷).\nThus, future scholars may **know the profound intent of this master** (知强君之深意).\n\nTherefore, he titled it: *The Dao De Jing (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue) with Profound Virtue Commentary by Sage-Laozi*.\n\nOn the **5th day of the 5th month, in the 2nd year of the Qian De era** (乾德二年庚辰降圣节戊申日),\n**Master Guangcheng Du Guangting** (广成先生光禄大夫尚书户部侍郎上柱国蔡国公杜光庭),\n**Grandee of the Purple Robes, Minister of the Household Department, and Duke of Cai** (光禄大夫尚书户部侍郎上柱国蔡国公),\nComposed this preface.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of the Profound Virtue Commentary on the Dao De Jing**\n\n**Commentaries by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang (唐玄宗御注) and others**,\n**Master Ge Shanggong’s and Yan Junping’s annotations (河上公严君平李荣注)**,\n**Master Xihua’s and Cheng Xuanjing’s exegesis (西华法师成玄英疏)**,\n**Montang’s Qi Muyue’s compilation (蒙阳强思齐纂)**.\n\nThis scripture is the **crown of the Three Teachings** (三教之冠冕),\nThe **leader of all scriptures** (众经之领袖),\nEncompassing the **great without exclusion** (大无不包),\nAnd the **small without omission** (细无不入),\nExhausting **principle** (穷理) and **essence** (尽性),\nBeyond all **conceptual limits** (不可思议).\nThus, it is titled *The Dao De Jing (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue)*.\n\nThe **Dao** is the **boundless realm of emptiness and flow** (虚通之理境),\n**Virtue** is the **forgetful wisdom of profound insight** (志忘之妙智).\nThe **realm** can **awaken wisdom** (发智),\nAnd **wisdom** can **subdue the realm** (克境).\nWhen **realm and wisdom converge** (境智相会),\nIt is called *The Dao De Jing*.\n\nIts **intricate and profound meanings** (委曲玄旨) are fully explained in the **opening preface** (开题义).\nNow, examining the **upper chapter’s thirty-seven sections** (上卷三十七章),\nThey are divided into **three major categories**:\nThe first **one chapter** (第一一章) marks the **Dao’s fundamental essence** (标道宗致),\nThe second **thirty-five chapters** (第二三十五章) broadly expound the **Dao’s methods** (广明道法),\nThe third **one chapter** (第三一章) summarizes the **ultimate teaching** (总结指归).\n\nWithin this chapter, there are **four further distinctions**:\nThe first **briefly establishes principle and teaching** (略标理教),\nThe second **widely clarifies the original source** (泛明本边),\nThe third **contrasts the two perspectives** (显二观不同),\nThe fourth **unifies the profound essence of the Dao** (会重玄之致).\n\n---\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\" (道可道)**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\n---\n\n**First Distinction: Briefly Establishing Principle and Teaching**\n\nThe Great Dao is a boundless, mysterious principle beyond all forms. Its essence surpasses the grasp of symbols, and its operations arise from the unfathomable. It is not something that can be known by ordinary names, nor is it something that can be fully explored by mere speech. It encompasses all without exclusion, and it penetrates even the finest details—when it manifests, it rides upon the *Palm Boat* (慈舟) of compassion, and when it withdraws, it returns to the *Silent Obscurity* (杜默) of the unspoken. The Yellow Emperor fasted for three months before seeking it, yet Emperor Jing of the Former Han exhausted years without receiving an answer.\n\nIts substance is serene, its name is subtle. Some ascend with the *Dragon Chariot* (龙轩) to wander the *Jade Capital* (玉京), while others harness the *Luan* (鸾) and *Zhī* (骖) to float at the *Golden Gates* (金阙). The Western Sovereign Mother obtained it and sat in the *Minor Broad* (少广), while Dongfang Shuo encountered it and played in the Han Court. Heaven and Earth obtained it and thus were able to bring forth creation, while the myriad beings blew with the ten thousand breaths and gave birth to life. Ah! The profound and boundless Dao—how vast it is!\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao beyond speech.\n\n**Commentary by Yu** (御疏):\n*\"The Dao\"* is a strong designation for the boundless, mysterious origin. *\"By\"* (训由) refers to the path of its operations, *\"Law\"* (训法) refers to its methods, and *\"Constant\"* (训常) refers to its enduring nature. The first character marks its essence, saying that this mysterious origin is the universal path through which all things arise, and thus it may be called *Dao*—hence, *\"The Dao That Can Be Spoken.\"*\n\nIt can be called *Dao* because the scripture says: *\"I do not know its name; I call it Dao.\"* This is to guide students in attaining clarity of nature and cultivating the mind, thus naming it *Dao*.\n\nSeeking its mysterious origin, one finds that its principle is utterly clear and void, its nature is beyond comprehension—neither luminous nor obscure.\n\nAgain, referring to the following passage in the scripture: *\"When seen, it is not seen—called *Yī* (夷); when heard, it is not heard—called *Xī* (希); when grasped, it is not obtained—called *Wēi* (微).\"* The passage before it—*\"When seen, it is not seen\"*—refers to seeking the Dao through color, *\"When heard, it is not heard\"*—through sound, *\"When grasped, it is not obtained\"*—through form. Yet the mysterious Dao is too subtle and profound to be attained by worldly means of sound, color, or form.\n\nReferring to the *\"Scripture of the Nine Heavens Giving Birth to Spirits\"* (九天生神经), it says: *\"The Sage uses the Three Primordials of Mysterious Origin—*Sān Xī* (三熙)—as his substance, speaking of the Three Mysterious Primordials of the Three Heavens—*Sān Miào Xī* (三妙熙).\"* Master Zang Zongdao further uses *\"Three One\"* (三一) as the Sage’s manifested body. The *\"Three One\"* refers to: one *Jīng* (精), two *Shén* (神), and three *Qì* (氣).\n\n*Jīng* is the heart of luminous wisdom and intuitive intelligence. *Shén* is the faculty of boundless, unfathomable operation. *Qì* is the method of colors and forms.\n\nThe scripture says: *\"When seen, it is not seen—called *Yī* (夷), the *Jīng*; when heard, it is not heard—called *Xī* (希), the *Shén*; when grasped, it is not obtained—called *Wēi* (微), the *Qì*.\"* These three methods are unified into one Sage, and the Sage embodies these three aspects without any contradiction—thus, they are merged into one.\n\nBut the *Dao*’s methods and substance are expressed through *\"Three One\"* (三一), which has distinctions between true and manifested. The interpretations of this vary among three schools:\nThe first says: *\"Dissolving the One into Three\"*—meaning the Sage’s manifested body merges the Three into One, which is the Sage’s true substance.\nThe second says: *\"The Three and the One are both manifested; neither the Three nor the One is true. The Three and the One are merely names and numbers.\"*\nThe third asks: *\"Is there a true substance beyond names and numbers, separate from the Three and the One?\"*\n\nIt is said that *\"Three One\"* is not Three nor One—this is the true substance. *\"Three One\"* is neither Three nor One—this is the manifested body. The manifested body that is not *\"Three One\"* is the true manifested body, while the true substance that is *\"Three One\"* is the manifested true substance. The true substance of the manifested body cannot be definitively called true, nor can the manifested body of the true substance be definitively called manifested. Thus, it is neither true nor manifested, yet it is both manifested and true.\n\nThe Sage responds to stimuli and adapts to circumstances, manifesting in myriad forms—sometimes appearing in human guise, sometimes as a celestial being. He reveals himself according to the situation, and his transformations follow the times. His subtle essence is beyond *Yī* (夷) and *Xī* (希), yet it remains difficult to fully comprehend.\n\n**Rong** (荣) says:\n*The Dao* is the principle of boundless voidness, and its symbols cannot be divided by existence or nonexistence. Its true substance cannot be confined by the extremes of high or low. It is said to be mysterious yet beyond thought, profound yet beyond recognition.\n\nThe Sage lays bare this path of the mysterious, opening it as a teaching. He borrows the term *\"Round and Pass Through\"* (圆通) to designate the boundless voidness, calling it the principle that can be named, and thus the *Dao* that can be spoken. *\"I do not know its name\"*—the Sage achieves the Dao through boundless voidness, and its constant nature is attained through serene stillness. This is called the *\"Boundless Great Dao\"* (无极大道), which is the original nature of all beings.\n\nWhat is the *Heavenly Dao*? It is the system of voidness, the root of transformation, the origin of divine illumination, and the source of Heaven and Earth. It is boundless without exclusion, subtle without interiority, vast without end, and profound without measure. Though it is the most hidden and obscure, its great light shines forth. Though it is utterly still without heart, the myriad things have their fixed places. It is mixed and indistinct without form, silent and empty without sound. Yet from it arise all phenomena, and from it are formed the five tones. That which is born has limits, that which is formed has deficiencies. Birth and formation, birth and formation—eternal and unchanging, from ancient times to the present. This is what is called *Dao*.\n\nBefore the *Primordial Qi* (元气) and the boundless voidness, there was serene stillness—what was there? When the most refined essence was stirred, the *True One* (真一) was born.\n\nThe *True One* moves with divine illumination, and thus the *Primordial Qi* transforms naturally. The *Primordial Qi* is the existence within nonexistence, the nonexistence within existence—vast beyond measure, subtle beyond detection. It gradually condenses and solidifies, becoming indistinct and formless, yet from it emerge the origins of all phenomena. Thus, the clear and luminous *Qi* (氣) ascends to form Heaven, while the turbid and obscured *Qi* gathers to form Earth. The harmonious and gentle *Qi* coalesces into human beings and their roles, while the chaotic and rigid *Qi* disperses into various other types.\n\nFrom the single *Qi*’s nurturing, myriad differences are spread and classified. Once the mechanism of transformation is engaged, change is endless without limit. Yet the forms of Heaven, Earth, and all beings arise from the *Primordial Qi* (元氣). That which grants Heaven, Earth, and all beings their spirit is divine illumination. Thus, *Lián* (乾) and *Kūn* (坤) govern Heaven and Earth, while *Jīng* (精) and *Hún* (魂) oversee all beings.\n\n*Qi* undergoes the revolutions of *Yīn* and *Yáng*, while divine illumination is unaffected by cold or heat. Though all things move in confusion beyond count, they perish only to be reborn, end only to begin anew. Yet the body of *Dao* and *Virtue* (德), the divine illumination of the mind, respond to stimuli endlessly without ever being exhausted by the realm of motion and operation.\n\n「The Dao/Way is profound yet encompasses the ten millionfold Heaven without making it vast, penetrates the finest autumn hair without making it small. It precedes the void and formlessness yet is not the beginning, succeeds Heaven and Earth yet is not their end. It ascends to the accumulation of Yang without becoming luminous, descends into the depths of Yin without becoming obscure.\n\nOriginally, there is no *spirit* (神). At the utmost void, spirit emerges. Originally, there is no *Qi* (炁). Through the movement of spirit, Qi transforms. Without foundation or substance, it condenses and coalesces to form shape; shape, originally without *emotion* (情), is diminished by motion and operation.\n\nAs form takes shape and nature moves, the Dao/Way grows ever more distant. Thus, one is lost in birth and death, shifting between Yin and Yang, unable to halt oneself—this is not because the Dao/Way is forgotten while existing, but because it can cause the existent to return to the nonexistent.\n\nHence, the Dao/Way is able to generate existence from nonexistence; how much more can it make the existent conform to the nonexistent! If the existent conforms to the nonexistent, then existence will not perish. Therefore, the Dao/Way gives birth to me, yet passion destroys me. If one forgets passion, then nature is preserved intact. When nature is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, Qi is whole; when Qi is refined, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, the Dao/Way is whole. Thus, when the Dao/Way is complete, spirit reigns supreme; when spirit reigns, Qi becomes responsive; when Qi is responsive, form transcends; when form transcends, nature is fully realized. Those who fully realize nature return and circulate endlessly, merging with the Dao/Way.\n\nIt can make the existent nonexistent, can make the void substantial. I shall align myself with the Creator and let birth and death fail to burden me.\n\nThe Dao/Way can be spoken of as *substance* (體), and named as *function* (用). That which can be spoken of is but the Dao/Way’s manifestation. Though it may be called \"speakable,\" things adapt to their circumstances, giving rise to sound and speech—this is not the Dao/Way of eternal stillness and repose.\n\n○ **Yán** (嚴) says: When *Dao/Virtue* (道德) is manifest, it is not natural. When fame and achievement are displayed, it is not true essence.\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: That which can be spoken of is not the Dao/Way of natural longevity.\n\nThe Dao/Way of constancy should cultivate the nonexistent to nourish the spirit, remain without affairs to settle the people, contain light and conceal brilliance, erase traces and obscure origins—it cannot be named.\n\n○ **Róng** (榮) says: This is not the Dao/Way of humans honoring through rites and propriety, elevating through superficial splendor, losing themselves to gain fame, forgetting themselves to serve profit. They abandon the Dao/Way and follow Virtue (德) thereafter; this teaching now prevails. But having stripped away the trappings of benevolence and righteousness, taking the essence of Dao/Virtue, and returning to the source of purity and simplicity, one reverses their constant passions. Hence, it is called the Dao/Way of constancy.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏): The Dao/Way of constancy cannot be defined by words or reasoned through the mind; it transcends subtlety and eludes the grasp of logic. Thus, knowing beyond words and symbols, one may then conform to the eternal stillness—what can be spoken of and named is not the Dao/Way of constancy.\n\nThat which can be named is not the Dao/Way’s true name.\n○ **Yù Zhù** (御注): Names are the Dao/Way’s designations. I forcefully name it the *Great* (大).\n\nNames do not stand alone; they arise from substance. Words do not exist in isolation; they are established by Virtue (德). The operation of principles and substance flows without obstruction, encompassing all to reach the boundless. Thus, I name the Dao/Way’s *Great* (大) designation to the Dao/Way’s substance, so that things may recognize it—hence, \"that which can be named is named.\"\n\n○ **Yù’s Commentary** (御疏): Names are teachings. Earlier, it was said that what can be spoken of is manifest in principle; now, it is said that what can be named is secondary in teaching. True principle transcends words and symbols, and even teachings surpass verbal articulation.\n\nSince principle is the Dao/Way of constancy yet cannot be spoken of, and teaching is that which can be named yet not the Dao/Way’s true name, one who seeks to clarify principle and teaching finds they are neither one nor different.\n\nYet the supreme Dao/Way is profound and mysterious, beyond measure or limit. It is neither nonexistent nor existent, neither fixed nor constant—though it is not constant, there is still uplift and subsidence. Teaching exists in gradual and sudden stages; thus, constancy is established to break the speakable, hence the statement that the speakable Dao/Way is not the Dao/Way of constancy.\n\nAt the extreme of discourse, there is neither \"can\" nor \"cannot,\" nor is it the Dao/Way of constancy and non-constancy. Hence, the *Jùjīng Jīng* (玉京经) says: *\"Without can or cannot, ponder with the subtle and minute.\"* That which can be named is not the vulgar honor of transient fame, so it is rejected as \"not the Dao/Way of constancy,\" desiring one to abandon the impermanent and return to the eternal constancy.\n\nThere are causes of transcendence and stages of gradual and sudden enlightenment. Opening with the square, one picks up the impermanent; to grasp the eternal constancy, one must go beyond the square. Presenting it to its ultimate, there is no impermanent to be picked up, nor any eternal constancy to be taken—how much more so is the Dao/Way neither the impermanent nor the eternal constancy, nor is it the Dao/Way of the non-eternal constancy nor the Dao/Way of the eternal constancy!\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: It is not the name of the Dao/Way that is naturally ever-present.\n\nThe name of constancy should be like an infant before speech, a chicken egg before division, a bright pearl within the shell, or a fine jade hidden in stone—internally luminous, externally dull. The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Dao/Way of constancy; that which can be named is not the Dao/Way’s true name.\n\nThe second passage clarifies the original traces.\nThe nonexistent is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The existent is the mother of all things.\n\n○ **Yù Zhù** (御注): The nonexistent is the mysterious origin. The mysterious origin reveals itself in Qi, temporarily manifesting as Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth derive their beginning, so the nonexistent is called the beginning. The existent is the response to application.\n\n○ **Róng** (榮) says: The Dao/Way is profound, its Virtue (德) subtle. Principle transcends existence and nonexistence. Since existence and nonexistence are transcended, names are discarded. Yet the function of void and emptiness is limitless—how can it not be nonexistent while being nonexistent? Thus, the nonexistent is the beginning of the two principles (兩儀). The existent, though not truly existent, is the mother of all things.\n\nHence, the Dao/Way generates and accumulates Virtue (德)—this is what is meant.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏): This nonexistent is the origin of all things. The Dao/Way originally has no name, thus it is known that it cannot be spoken of or explained. The existent is the mother of all things, as it is described. The Dao/Way of *Double Mystery* (重玄) originally has no name; descending from the origin to traces, names and designations arise. Thus, the sage establishes the existent from the nonexistent, entrusting the existent to elucidate the nonexistent, desiring to nurture all beings and lead them back to their origin. With compassion and mercy, they cultivate and nourish, akin to a mother’s care.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: The nonexistent is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The nonexistent is the Dao/Way, for the Dao/Way has no form and thus cannot be named.»\n\n「The origin is where the Dao/Way emits *qi* and spreads its transformations, arising from the void and nonexistent, marking the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The existent, named as the mother of all things, refers to Heaven and Earth—Heaven and Earth possess form and position, and *yin* and *yang* exhibit softness and rigidity; thus, they are called by name.\n\nThe mother of all things is Heaven and Earth, which combine in harmony to generate all things, nurturing them to growth, maturity, and fulfillment, as a mother raises her children. The third realm manifests two distinct perspectives.\n\nTo observe its subtlety, one must habitually be without desire; to perceive its intricacies, one must habitually indulge desire.\n\n○ **御注** (Imperial Annotation): When a person is born and remains tranquil, it reflects the nature of Heaven. When they respond to things and move, it is the stirrings of their innate desires. If one can perpetually uphold purity and stillness, free the mind and release the spirit, and return to reflect upon their original nature, then they can observe the wondrous origin. If one does not still their emotions, but instead pursues desires and moves with them, their nature is lost to desire, and they become bewildered at the source of the Dao/Way. If they then seek to observe the wondrous origin, they will only perceive its marginal subtleties.\n\n○ **御疏** (Imperial Commentary): To habitually be without desire means to uphold the law-nature of purity and stillness, detached from speech and thought, with no lingering attachments—thus, one perceives the Dao/Way’s most subtle and wondrous essence. To habitually indulge desire is to rise from the origin and act, establishing teachings through speech, adapting to things and achieving harmony, transforming the world—thus, one perceives the convergence of all beings.\n\n○ **缴** (return) is to **归** (return).\n\n○ **严** (Yan) says: To be without desire is to gaze beyond all gazing. To observe its subtlety is to peer into the *Taiqing* (Great Clarity).\n\n○ **荣** (Rong) illuminates the distinction between desire and non-desire: When a person receives life, all are endowed with their beginning by virtue and the Dao/Way, sharing the same breath of *qi* from *yin* and *yang*, yet differing in their luminous and obscure spirits, their tranquil and restless natures. To walk without desire is to smooth the heart and traverse the silent path, to purify the will and ford the mysterious depths—when desires are insufficient to disturb the spirit, and distractions cannot slip the mind, the luminous platform is serene and cold, the mysterious mirror deep and clear. Then one can perceive the marginal subtleties and grasp the wondrous essence; this is the way of non-desire.\n\nThe way of desire, if one cannot yet abandon recognition, when emotions are bound within form and roam through the body, is not merely agitation over sounds and colors, but to adhere to the affairs of the existent—how does one recognize the principles of the nonexistent? This is the way of desire.\n\n○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: To habitually be without desire and observe its subtlety, for subtlety is the essence. When a person habitually remains without desire, they can observe the Dao/Way’s essence. The essence is oneness—from this oneness, names and transformations are emitted, and the Dao/Way is praised. This is the Master who discerns right and wrong.\n\n○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): **缴** (return) is to **归** (return). Desire is the entanglement of emotions. **所** (that which) is the realm.»\n\n「Though one cannot act without *for* [事], nor remain tranquil and unadorned, yet observing the Dao/Way’s subtlety and upholding its truth—when false stirrings arise in hunger and seeking, when emotions run wild and cling to stagnation—this is but the sight of the world’s *for* [有], failing to grasp that *for* [有] is empty. Thus, one cannot perceive the Dao/Way’s profound principles, seeing only the fate of life and death. This earlier distinction of nameless and named *virtue/power* [名] now reveals the triumph of desireless over desireful conduct.\n\nThe Fourth Assembly expounds the *Dao/Way’s* ultimate subtlety. These two—though sharing the same origin, differing only in name—\n○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: As with the two above, both arise from the Dao/Way, hence they are called the same.\nFrom movement comes application; names are established according to use, hence their difference.\n\n○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: Both derive from the same subtle source, thus they are identical in origin. Names differ as they are applied to distinct uses.\n\n○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: Desireful and desireless conduct both originate from the human heart. Desireless conduct endures, while desireful conduct consumes the self—thus their difference.\n\n○ **荣** (Róng) says: In close terms, these two—desireful and desireless—refer to humanity. All share the five constant essences [五常], all possess the same *innate mind* [方寸之心], hence their sameness.\nTo reject clarity and remain tranquil, penetrating the Dao/Way’s source, is to attain the *subtle* [妙]. To be ensnared by perceptions before understanding, lost in mundane affairs, is to fall into *entanglement* [缴]. This is their divergence in name.\n\nIn broader terms, the Sage seeks to fulfill the Dao/Way’s clear and empty principles, thus taking *virtue/power* [道德] as their core. Hence, this chapter emphasizes their duality—*virtue/power* [道德] and *virtue/power* [道德]—while the Dao/Way’s essence remains unified. Thus, they are called the same.\nThe *Dao/Way’s* essence, arising from stillness, is hence termed *out* [出]. Its transformative function is the Dao/Way itself; its nurturing principle is the manifestation of *virtue/power* [德]. Thus, the Dao/Way’s names differ.\n\n○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): Though these two share the same origin, differing only in name—*entanglement* [缴] and *subtle* [妙]—the observed realm is singular, yet the capacity to observe varies. Since the two modes of observation differ, *entanglement* [缴] and *subtle* [妙] are named distinctively.\nThis is called the *Dao/Way’s* ultimate subtlety [玄].\n\n○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: When spoken of as *out* [出], their names differ; when spoken of as the same, it is called the *Dao/Way’s* ultimate subtlety [玄], which is profound and subtle.\n\n○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] is the heavens. It states that those with desireful or desireless conduct all receive *qi* [气] from the heavens.\n\n○ **荣** (Róng) says: The Dao/Way of emptiness and stillness, the *virtue/power* [德] of profound subtlety—its elusive nature is not easily grasped, its silent mystery not easily spoken of. No name can suffice.\nThe term *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is borrowed to signify the same, for the Dao/Way’s subtlety is ineffable. Only the Dao/Way and *virtue/power* [德] can convey *ultimate subtlety* [玄], hence it is said: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] is profound and distant, the Dao/Way is supremely subtle and still.\n\n○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: When spoken of as *out* [出], their names differ—this is the progression from origin to application.\nWhen spoken of as the same, it signifies profound subtlety—this is the return to the source, transcending all dualities.\nTo return to the source is to attain profound subtlety, hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\n\n○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] means profound and distant, also the name for non-stagnation. The twofold heart of desireful and desireless conduct, both modes of observing *entanglement* [缴] and *subtle* [妙], originate from the same Dao/Way, differing only in name.\nThe Dao/Way, though named differently, is profound and distant. Its principle returns to non-stagnation.\nNeither stagnating in existence nor in non-existence, both are transcended—hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\n*Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄], is the gateway to all subtleties.\n\n○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: Since the mind does not generate, it aligns with the profound subtlety. Yet fearing that *ultimate subtlety* [玄] might be taken as stagnation, it further dismisses the notion of attachment, demonstrating that desireless conduct transcends desire. Those who attain this understand all *dharma* [法], hence it is called the gateway to all subtleties.\n\n○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is the heavens within the heavens. Those who receive *qi* [气] with varying depths—if they attain the harmony of *central equilibrium* [中和] and pure nourishment, they become sages and worthy. If they fall into disorder and impurity, they become nobles of licentiousness.\nThe gateway to all subtleties is to know that the heavens contain another heavens, that *qi* [气] has varying depths, and to eliminate emotions and desires while guarding *central equilibrium* [中和]. This is the gateway to understanding the Dao/Way’s essence.\n\n○ **荣** (Róng) says: *Virtue/power* [道德] is elusive and profound, its principles surpassing all speech and forms. Its true essence is tranquil and vast, its affairs transcending existence and non-existence. Borrowing terms beyond speech and forms, beyond existence and non-existence, to illuminate the Dao/Way’s hidden path—hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\nYet one might fear that those lost in duality cling to the pillar, or those who abandon principle guard the stump. Thus, to fix *ultimate subtlety* [玄] as the true Dao/Way is incorrect. Therefore, it is further stated: it is not the fixed name of existence or non-existence.\nUsing *ultimate subtlety* [玄] to dismiss existence and non-existence, once existence and non-existence are dismissed, *ultimate subtlety* [玄] itself is lost—hence it is said: *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\n*Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is beyond threefold reversal and fourfold phrasing. It is boundless and open, unimpeded by emptiness, encompassing all phenomena’s pivotal essence and unlocking the hundredfold gates of wisdom. Those who reach this state—all subtleties’ gateway.\n\n○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: The *Scripture of Western Ascension* [西升经] states: \"Same origin, differing names, each generates its own *emotional causes* [意因].\"\nNow, without generating *emotional causes* [意因], it is identical with profound subtlety.\nDesireless conduct in desirelessness—desirelessness is the *emotional cause* [意因] for desire. Hence, one seeks desirelessness.\nTo seek desirelessness while still clinging to desire is not yet free. Now, having no desire, there is no gateway either.\n○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄]—for those with desire, desirelessness is the dismissal of attachment again and again, until all is forgotten.\nTrue observation, such as this, is the attainment of all subtleties.\nThough subtleties are many, they all originate from this—yet one stagnates in existence, while the desireless person stagnates in non-existence. Hence, it speaks of *ultimate subtlety* [玄] to dismiss both attachments.\nAgain, fearing that scholars might stagnate in this *ultimate subtlety* [玄], it further speaks of *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄], to further alleviate the lingering affliction.\nNot only does it not stagnate, but it also transcends non-stagnation—this is the dismissal of attachment again and again, hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\nThe gateway to all subtleties—*subtlety* [妙] refers to the essential subtlety, *gateway* [门] is the *dharma gate* [法门].\nEarlier, the profound subtlety of central unity dismissed the duality of both categories. Once the dual afflictions are removed, the profound subtlety’s medicine is further dismissed. Thus, medicine and affliction vanish simultaneously—this is the ultimate subtlety, the pinnacle of profound principles, exhausting all reason and nature. It is not merely the door to sages, but also the gateway to all subtleties.»\n\n「**The World All Knows Beauty as Beauty, the Second Chapter**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the earlier chapter elucidates the two views of existence and non-existence [有无二观], with their coarse and subtle distinctions. Therefore, this chapter reveals the efficacy of the *non-action* [无为] and the perils of *action* [有为], dividing its meaning into two parts: the first clarifies the common attachments and stagnations that give rise to confusion and delusion, while the second demonstrates the *sage’s wisdom* [圣智] in its emptiness and clarity, as it forgets merit and aids beings without self-interest.\n\n**First: Clarifying the Common Attachments and Stagnations That Give Rise to Delusion**\nWithin this chapter, two further distinctions are made: the first two sentences broadly refute the illusory nature of beauty and goodness [美善], while the remaining six sentences, in three pairs, illuminate the emptiness of all phenomena [诸法无实].\n\n**First: Broadly Refuting the Illusory Nature of Beauty and Goodness**\nThe ordinary folk of the world are ensnared by sounds and colors, bound by *action* [有为], never finding true repose. They chase fame and profit like monkeys leaping from branch to branch, indulge in love and desire like moths drawn to flame. They confuse evil for good, regard ease as difficulty, and dwell in the nameless void of ignorance, clinging stubbornly to their fragile, perilous selves. How could they comprehend the *subtle Dao* [妙道] in its emptiness and fluidity, the true words and rational sequence, when its brilliance and obscurity defy explanation, and its acceptance is blind? The Seven Sages [七圣] lost their way at Xiangcheng, and Xizi spoke in vain at Hengshan. Sounds and colors fade into nothingness, and the distinction between self and other dissolves into emptiness. Only by abandoning the flawed body of *existence with defilements* [有漏] can one align with the *non-action Dao* [无为之道].\n\nThe world all knows beauty as beauty—then evil arises.\nThe world all knows goodness as goodness—then what is not good arises.\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\nBeauty and goodness arise from desire [欲心]. When desire dictates what is beautiful or good, even what is evil becomes beautiful or good—hence, \"the world all knows.\" One takes what pleases their own desires as beautiful or good, but beauty and goodness have no inherent master; they are merely deluded emotions, born from clinging to distinctions of existence and non-existence, ease and difficulty, the wondrous and the foul—each falsely usurping the other.\n\nThe Great Sage discerns this emptiness and delusion, thus declaring, \"Then evil arises.\"\n\n**Commentary from the *Riverbank Master* [河上公]:**\nWhen the world all knows beauty as beauty, it is merely self-praise, making it appear radiant.\n\n\"Then evil arises\"—this means peril and ruin are imminent.\nWhen the world all knows goodness as goodness, it implies a demand for merit and reward—then what is not good arises, and people vie for it.\n\n**Commentary by Yan [严]:**\nHuman cleverness can be cut off but not dispersed; human desires can be resisted but not reversed. Adorning one’s appearance harms one’s nature, and gratifying desire shortens one’s life. The world’s so-called \"beauty and goodness\" are not the utmost beauty or goodness.\n\nTrue beauty is not what the world can see, and true goodness is not what the world can know.\n\n**Commentary by Rong [荣]:**\nBeauty is pleasure.\nAll people, by their inherent nature, cannot find joy in the Dao but instead take glory as pleasure. Pleasure cannot be boundless—when pushed to extremes, sorrow follows. Desire cannot be indulged recklessly—when unrestrained, it leads to ruin. Hence, people take sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes as supreme pleasure, unaware of how these very things bring great calamity.\n\nWhen simplicity [朴] becomes a curse, when simplicity is lost, sorrow arises. When the root is extinguished, nature is harmed, and the body falls into ruin.\n\nThe world all knows goodness as goodness—then what is not good arises.\n\nFrom the highest to the lowest, the noble and the vulgar, none can truly empty their minds and selves, yet all indulge their desires and emotions. Though their affections differ, each follows their nature and shares the same attachments.\n\nThose who love fame regard fame as goodness; those who love profit regard profit as goodness. If one pursues profit without the proper means, or clings to fame to the point of self-destruction, then goodness becomes ruinous.\n\nThough conforming to desire may seem good, it leads to self-destruction—this is true evil. Hence, Boyi perished for fame atop Mount Shouyang, while Zhi the Thief died for profit beneath the Eastern Ling. This is what is not good.\n\n*The world* [世问] is a general term for the worldly realm.\n*The world* [世问] refers to all beings between the heavens and the earth, those who are immersed in dusty illusions and falsely cling to beauty and evil. Those who oppose their true nature stir hatred—this is called evil. Those who follow their deluded intentions breed attachment—this is called beauty.\n\nNot knowing that all phenomena are both *existent* [有] and *empty* [空], when beauty and evil are seen as empty, why cling to hatred or love?\n\nThus, the *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Maoqiang and Xishi are what people call beautiful, but fish see them as deep and dark, and birds see them as high and lofty.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The beautiful praise themselves as beautiful—I do not know their beauty.*\n*The evil condemn themselves as evil—I do not know their evil.\"*\n\nBy this, it is proven that beauty and evil are mere illusions. Hence, one who clings to worldly beauty as true beauty knows only evil, and one who clings to worldly goodness as true goodness knows only what is not good.\n\nThe vulgar masses, lost in delusion, do not merely indulge in sounds and colors but also fixate on reputation, seeking fame even at the cost of their lives, harming others for personal gain. They do not realize that goodness is an empty, delusive notion—hence, the following passage asks: *Which is closer to one’s self, fame or the body?*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To do good without seeking fame is near,\"*\nand also:\n*\"What they prize and cherish are none other than fame and goodness.\"*\n\nThus, it is clear that clinging to fame and goodness contradicts true principle. Only by forgetting goodness and evil and attaining the *central equilibrium* [居中] can one truly embody the *non-action Dao* [无为之致].\n\n**Second: Illuminating the Emptiness of All Phenomena**\nThus, *existence* [有] and *non-existence* [无] give rise to each other.\n\n**Commentary from the *Riverbank Master*:**\nTo perceive *existence* [有] as *non-existence* [无]—this is the nature of emptiness.\n\n**Commentary by Rong:**\nAll things arise from *existence* [有], and *existence* [有] arises from *non-existence* [无]. From *non-existence* [无] comes *existence* [有], and from *existence* [有] returns *non-existence* [无]—hence, they give rise to each other.\n\nDifficulty and ease [难易] complete one another...»\n\nThus, the *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *\"The dharma is empty; the potter finds ease in shaping clay but struggles with wood, while the artisan finds ease in carving wood but struggles with clay.\"* ○ **Yán** says: *\"Difficulty is revealed through ease, and ease is illuminated by difficulty; without skill, one cannot discern ease, and without ease, one cannot grasp difficulty. If one can skillfully abandon both, then the names of difficulty and ease both cease.\"* ○ The *Riverbank Master* says: *\"To perceive difficulty as ease.\"* ○ **Róng** says: *\"All things under heaven arise from difficulty as ease, difficulty springs from ease, and ease fulfills difficulty. Ease emerges from difficulty, and difficulty becomes ease.\"*\n\nThe *Master Cheng*’s commentary states: *\"The mind of emptiness and the view of harmony—without ease or difficulty, distinctions arise from attachment. With attachment to difficulty or ease, then difficulty and ease both manifest. Thus, it is known that the two dharmas of difficulty and ease interdependently arise.\"*\n\nLength and shortness mutually define each other. The *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *\"They are empty in nature.\"* ○ **Yán** says: *\"An inch is short when measured by a foot, a foot is long when measured by an inch. Without length, one cannot clarify shortness; without shortness, one cannot discern length. Length and shortness are empty—they have no inherent reality—hence, they are called empty.\"*\n\n○ The *Riverbank Master* says: *\"To perceive shortness as length.\"* ○ **Róng** says: *\"When separated, there is neither great nor small; when gathered, there is short and long. The Great Mountain and the autumn hair differ in magnitude, the White Crane and the Green Hare diverge in span—thus, it is known that forgetting them yields neither great nor small, while retaining them reveals short and long.\"*\n\n○ The *Master Cheng*’s commentary states: *\"Measuring length by length, there is no length; comparing shortness with shortness, there is no shortness—thus, it is known that length and shortness mutually define each other and differ.\"*\n\nHeight and lowliness mutually incline. The *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *\"They are empty in name.\"* ○ **Yán** says: *\"Mountains are diminished by valleys, valleys are tilted by mountains. Without mountains, one cannot know valleys; without valleys, one cannot know mountains. Like worldly status shifting between master and servant, there is no fixed position.\"* ○ The *Riverbank Master* says: *\"To perceive height as lowliness.\"* ○ **Róng** says: *\"Incline, means peril. Water sustains boats yet also capsizes them; the scriptures say: 'The high becomes the foundation for the low, the low becomes perilous to the high.' The lowliness of the low is still perilous to the high, and the nobility of the high is indeed capable of extinguishing the low. Losing the Dao, height and lowliness become perilous; attaining the Dao, ruler and subject both flourish. Incline, means to topple and seize—where there is height, there is lowliness; without lowliness, there is no height. For instance, a foot measured against an inch is high, while the same foot measured against a yard is low. What was once high becomes now low—thus, it is known that height and lowliness have no fixed reality, only mutual incline and seizure, hence all are empty.\"*\n\nSound and voice harmonize together. The *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *\"This illustrates the emptiness of harmony and unity.\"*\n\nWho shapes the harmony of the five tones? The *Riverbank Master* says: *\"The tones are distinguished by voice, and voice is measured by tone. Without tone, there is no way to know voice; without voice, there is no way to know tone.\"*\n\nThe *Master of Strictness* responds: *\"The high sings, the low responds with harmony.\"*\n\n**Daoist Classic of the Mysterious Virtue: *Zhenjing* (True Scripture) – Imperial Commentary and Exegesis by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang, with annotations by Master Riverbank, Master Yan, Master Li, and Master Cheng**\n\n**Chapter 5: \"Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent\"**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter expounded the Dao of emptiness and mystery, transcending all phenomena before their manifestation. Thus, this chapter reveals the principle of forgetting merit, where the Sage aligns with the two primal forces (*Yin* and *Yang*) in virtue.\n\nWithin this chapter, three themes unfold:\n1. The Sage and Heaven and Earth, acting without attachment to merit,\n2. The analogy of the uncarved block (*su* – raw) and the empty vessel (*qiao* – hollow), illustrating the subtle efficacy of the Dao,\n3. The critique of excessive knowledge and learning, which pale in comparison to attaining the Dao’s truth.\n\n**1. The Sage and Heaven and Earth, acting without attachment to merit.**\nFrom the single breath of *Qi*, the two primal forces are shaped—*Yin* and *Yang* divide and settle: Heaven, round and clear, covers above; Earth, square and turbid, condenses below. Both owe their existence to the great Dao, sharing the same observation of *Yin-Yang Qi*. Why does *Nuwa* speak of refining stone to prop up Heaven? Why does *Kuafu* die at the banks of the River? Why does *Zhuiyi* walk endlessly without reaching the end? Why does *Qinmi* gaze without limit? Heaven and Earth show no favor, treating all things as mere *chúdǒu*—sacrificial straw-dogs. The vast *Tianhan* (Heavenly River) flows without regard for distance; the distant *Héyuán* (River’s Source) vanishes without measure. *Zhang Qian* could not fathom its length—compared to the uncarved block, only material form is seen; likened to the empty vessel, no sound of exhaustion is heard. The Dao of Heaven turns in its cycles—how could it be called benevolent?\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*.\nThe Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as *chúdǒu*.\n**Imperial Commentary:** *\"Not benevolent\"* means they do not act with benevolent favor.\n*\"Chúdǒu\"* refers to straw bound into the shape of a dog, used in sacrifices. Dogs, by nature, guard and bark—thus, they receive the protection of a roof. But the *chúdǒu* is merely a dog in form, lacking the true function of barking and guarding. Hence, it is said to have no genuine connection to benevolence or love. It is as if Heaven and Earth regard humanity no differently than they regard straw-dogs—expecting no gratitude in return.\n\n**Reflection:** If supreme benevolence has no favorites, who then embodies universal love? Love that is not supreme is merely partial. If one does not love only their own kin, then all under Heaven are kin. If one does not consider only their own children, then all under Heaven are children. Thus, supreme benevolence’s lack of partiality is in truth the most inclusive love.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *\"Benevolence\"* is the name given to universal love. *Chú* means straw; the straw-dog is formed by binding straw into a dog’s shape for sacrificial use. *Zhuangzi* states: *\"Before the straw-dog is offered in sacrifice, it is adorned with fine embroidery. Once the ritual is complete, it is discarded, and even its ashes are used for fuel.\"* Heaven and Earth, in their supreme benevolence, give rise to all beings, just as humans bind straw into a dog’s form—expecting no barking or guarding in return. They do not regard the act of creation as benevolent favor, hence they are called *\"not benevolent.\"*\n\nThe Sage, in pardoning the world, views the people likewise—no expectations, no demands.\n\n**Annotation by Master Yan:** *\"Heaven, by its height, is clear and bright; Earth, by its depth, is moist and tranquil. *Yin* and *Yang* interact, and harmonious *Qi* flows. Thus, all things arise naturally without contrivance—Heaven and Earth do not labor with their hearts to show benevolence. The Sage upholds the Dao and harmonizes with it, remaining serene and unchanging, adapting to all transformations with divine insight. Aligned with the Dao’s ways, the world responds, and all things transform spontaneously. Does this not free one from anxious deliberation, revealing the true nature of benevolence?\"*\n\n**Annotation by Master Li:** *\"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*. Long and short, right and wrong—all are natural distinctions. Benevolence is love. Where there is love, there is also hatred. Heaven and Earth act without intent, transcending love and hatred. Because they are without love, they are called ‘not benevolent.’ The straw-dog is merely straw shaped like a dog; in ancient rituals, it was used in offerings, then discarded. It is said that the straw-dog is not loved when used, nor hated when discarded—an analogy for Heaven and Earth’s warmth like spring *Qi* naturally flowing, where creation is not seen as benevolence, nor destruction as righteousness. The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as *chúdǒu*. The Sage acts without intent, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s virtue. The meaning of ‘not benevolent’ and ‘straw-dog’ is now clear.*\n\nThough their grace extends to grass and trees, their blessings reach even the *zhūyú* (fish and turtles), their winds and teachings precede humanity—yet still, they are called ‘people’ in this context.\"\n\n**Exegesis by Master Cheng:** *\"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*. Benevolence is favor; the straw-dog is a hollow imitation of a dog. *Zhuangzi* says: ‘The discarded straw-dog is still round and domed above, square and firm below—just as *Yin* and *Yang* cover and load all beings, nurturing them with care. Yet, it is said they have no benevolence because they regard all things as one straw-dog.’ What is the straw-dog? It is merely a dog in name, not in reality. How much more so for all phenomena, which are equally hollow and empty—none deserving the expectation of gratitude or return!\"*\n\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\ntreating the people as a straw-dog.\nThe Sage, in harmony with Heaven and Earth,\nshares their virtue and aligns with the Sun and Moon in luminosity,\nthus able to empty the heart for the benefit of all,\nwhose deeds rival the creative transformation.\nHence, first the *Yin* and *Yang* are raised,\nthen the Sage is revealed;\nthe Sage, though detached, rescues the teeming masses,\nyet still, no transformation is seen—\nwhat is transformed is but a straw-dog,\nhollow and empty, without substance.\nThe *Yin* and *Yang* encompass all sentient beings,\nso all things are called ‘the people’;\nthe Sage’s intent lies in the *rúqì* (compassionate beings),\nthus the term ‘people’ is used.\n\nIt is not that the Sage fails to transform the unknowing,\nbut rather that the knowing can perceive and follow the teachings.\n\n**Secondly, the analogy of the *tǔqiào* (leather bellows and reed pipe) is given,\nto illustrate the subtle efficacy.**\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like the *tǔqiào*?\n**Master Yu’s annotation:** *Tǔ*, like *wǎ* (leather pouch), *qiào*, like *dí* (reed pipe).\nThe bellows’ wind and the pipe’s breath,\nboth rely on emptiness and lack of intention,\nthus motion yields response.\n\nSo too, between Heaven and Earth,\nthe nurturing of all beings without partiality\narises from their emptiness and lack of intention.\n\n**Master Yu’s exegesis:** Between Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like the *tǔqiào*?\nEmpty yet unyielding, moved yet ever responsive.\n**Annotation:** *Tǔ* (leather pouch) refers to a skin bellows,\nused to fan wind and ignite fire.\n*Qiào* (reed pipe) is the *dí* (reed pipe),\nmeaning Heaven and Earth regard all things as straw-dogs\nbecause of their boundless void,\nthus generating all without favor or expectation—\njust as the discarded bellows fans wind,\nand the reed pipe breathes air.\nEver responsive to demand,\nyet without regard for me,\nthey empty themselves without yielding,\nand motion brings forth ever more breath and sound.\n\nThis likens the ruler’s empty-hearted silence,\npure transformation and uniform harmony,\nso there is no yielding or constraint,\nand daily use remains unknowing—\nmotion brings forth ever more teaching and efficacy.\n\n**Master Héshànggōng said:** Between Heaven and Earth, the void is boundless,\nand harmonious *qi* flows freely,\nthus all things arise spontaneously.\nIf a person can eliminate emotions and desires,\nrestrain indulgence in flavors,\npurify the five *zàng* (viscera),\nthen divine clarity will dwell within them.\n\nLike the *tǔqiào*, within it is empty and void,\nthus it can produce sound and breath.\n\n**Master Róng said:** Between Heaven and Earth—\nit is like the *tǔqiào*.\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoved yet ever responsive.\n**Annotation:** *Tǔ* (leather pouch) refers to the bellows;\n*qiào* (reed pipe) refers to the *suō* (mouth organ’s pipe).\n**Explanation:** *Qiāo* (yielding) means exhaustion;\n*jiān* (void) means the interior.\nThe bellows, being hollow within,\ncan endlessly produce all things.\nIf a person can empty the heart and body,\ndeploy wisdom and virtue without limit,\nthen their efficacy is boundless.\n\n**Master Cheng’s exegesis:** *Tǔ* is the leather pouch;\n*qiào* is the reed pipe.\nHeaven, Earth, and the Sage empty the heart for benefit—\nlike the *shēngguǎn* (mouth organ),\nwhen the leather pouch is inflated,\nthe meaning of emptiness continues in the following passage.\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoved yet ever responsive.\n\n**Master Yu’s exegesis:** The *tǔqiào* empties the heart without yielding,\nand motion brings forth ever more breath and sound.\n\n**Master Héshànggōng said:** If the *tǔqiào* were to abandon emptiness for attachment,\nthen its inner and outer would be blocked,\nand breath would not follow.\n\n**Master Yán said:** Heaven and Earth, though empty,\nact with love—\nthen transformation falters,\nand things do not arise fully.\nThe Sage, though empty,\nacts with love—\nthen virtue does not spread universally,\nthe realm does not ascend,\ngrace does not reach deeply,\nand deeds are not fully accomplished.\nThe *tǔqiào*, though empty,\nacts with love—\nthen its interior and exterior are sealed,\nand breath does not flow.\nWhy so?\nBecause love brings obstruction.\n\n**Master Cheng’s exegesis:** *Qiāo* (yielding) means exhaustion.\nThe *tǔqiào* is hollow within,\nthus breath and sound emerge.\nIf it were not exhausted,\nit would be like Heaven and Earth’s lack of intention,\nthus their creative transformation is boundless.\nMotion brings forth ever more—\nthe *tǔqiào* moves, and breath and sound arise;\nthe Sage responds, and teachings emerge.\n\n**Thirdly, it rejects excessive knowledge and broad learning,\npreferring instead to grasp the True.\nExcessive speech, though many,\ndoes not surpass holding to the Center.\n**Master Yu’s annotation:** Excessive speech without practice\nbrings only constraint and exhaustion.\nUniversal love is hard to fulfill,\nleading to resentment and hatred,\nthus it is better to embrace the *chōnghé* (unifying harmony),\nand all will be naturally sufficient.\n\n**Master Yu’s exegesis:** Excessive speech—\nthat is, much talk of universal love.\nMuch talk of universal love,\nyet in action, it is hard to fulfill,\nthus constraint and exhaustion arise without completion.\nThis shows that it is better to forget and respond in emptiness,\nembracing the *chōnghé* (unifying harmony),\nthen all will naturally suffice.\n**Annotation:** ‘Without practice’ means *xùn* (to answer/fulfill),\nreferring to mere empty words\nthat do not align with action.\n\n**Master Héshànggōng said:** Excessive speech brings exhaustion,\nexcessive deeds harm the spirit,\nexcessive speech harms the body.\nWith tongue and lips moving,\ndisaster and calamity are sure to follow.\nBetter to hold to the Center,\nbetter to hold to virtue within,\nnurturing the spirit and guarding the breath,\nloving few words.\n\n**Master Yán said:** Heaven and Earth do not speak,\nyet through their emptiness,\nthey attain the Center of all things,\nand the generation of beings is boundless.\nThe Sage does not speak,\nyet laws and decrees are empty and in accord with all—\nthen the celestial prisons are void without prohibition,\nthe spirits and gods are tranquil without action,\nand the realm is vast and orderly,\nunaware and unknowing,\nyet in great harmony.\n\n**Master Róng said:** *Qióng* (exhaustion) means *kùn* (constraint).\nIf speech is just and true,\nit fills the world without error.\nIf speech is not just and true,\nthen calamity enters through the mouth—\nthis is constraint and exhaustion.\nYet calamity and fortune lie in correctness and error,\nnot in quantity or lack.\nNow, excessive speech brings exhaustion,\nwarning against the loss of excessive speech,\nurging instead the gain of holding to the Center,\nso there is no obstruction in teaching,\nand inner accord with the forgotten word.\n\n**Master Cheng’s exegesis:** Excessive knowledge—\nthat is, broad and all-embracing learning.\nExhaustion—\nthat is, excessive speech.\nBroad learning and excessive speech\nonly increase worldly wisdom,\nyet they do not grasp the Dao,\nand their essence returns to the *qióngzhōng yīdào* (one path of emptiness and constraint).\nExcessive knowledge is but a means for action,\nwhile holding to the Center leads to longevity and eternal vision—\nthus they are measured against each other,\nand holding to the Center is superior.\nHence, *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"When the superficial is destroyed, the essential remains;\nwhen the broad is drowned, the heart is preserved.\"*\n\nYang Zhu further remarked:\n*\"A neighbor loses his sheep through many branching paths,\nwhile a scholar loses the Dao through many methods.\"*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Unending Valley Spirit**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior passage emphasized that extensive learning and broad knowledge are inferior to holding to the Center, and thus this chapter clarifies that only by holding to the Center can one attain the Unending Valley Spirit.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning is divided into two parts:\nFirst, it reveals the profound and mysterious Dao, capable of generating and sustaining the Two Principles.\nSecond, it illustrates the ceaseless and unchanging, yet effortless operation.\n\n**First Part: Revealing the Profound and Mysterious Dao, Capable of Generating and Sustaining the Two Principles**\nIndeed, both Heaven and humanity receive life through the wondrous *qi*. If one cultivates and nourishes it, they attain perfect wholeness. Thus, the Yellow Emperor rode dragons and ascended to the clouds, while Master Shu Qing attached himself to a deer and visited the Han Dynasty—both achieving millennial longevity. They laughed at the countless burial mounds, returning in the eighth month to inspect their homes, seeing the prancing steeds of immortals. The primal *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing) *qì* endures, the Valley Spirit preserves life, subtly and enduringly.\n\nBy adhering to the singular principle, one achieves eternal solidity;\nBy consuming the five *yá* (tooth-like, refined essences), one attains the True.\n\nWhite hair returns to youthful vitality,\nTortoise-like years extend to great longevity.\nSeeing the morning fungus and not sighing,\nEmbracing the great *chūn* (thousand-year) tree with certainty.\n\nTo the left, I pat the shoulder of Hongya,\nTo the right, I draw upon the spirit of Gaoqiu.\nHow does one reach this?\nThe subtle principles of nurturing and guarding are profound indeed.\n\n**The Unending Valley Spirit**\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*Gǔ* (Valley) is empty yet responsive.\n*Shén* (Spirit) is wondrous and unfathomable.\n*Sǐ* (Death) signifies rest.\nThe Valley’s response to sound is unknown—\nYet when there is sensation, it responds,\nAnd its response is as divine,\nAs divine as its response, yet it never rests.\nTo illuminate the supreme Dao—\nEmpty yet generating all things,\nIts wondrous operation defies naming,\nThus the Valley Spirit is used as an analogy.\n\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\nThe Unending Valley Spirit refers to the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\nThe Valley Spirit clarifies how the Valley responds to sound,\nLike the Dao responding to things—\nWhen there is sensation, it responds,\nAnd its response is divine.\n*Shén* (Spirit) is the name for the unfathomable.\n*Death* signifies rest,\nYet the unfathomable response never rests,\nHence, the Valley Spirit does not die.\n\n*Xiān* (Profound) means deep.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) means mother.\nThe Valley Spirit’s response is profoundly mysterious and beyond naming,\nNurturing all things to flourish,\nThus it is called the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n\nThe gate of the *xiānmǎn* is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe operation of the *xiānmǎn* is such that\nWhen there is sensation, it responds,\nAnd its response arises from things,\nThus it is called a gate.\n\nA gate signifies entry and exit.\nHeaven and Earth, the greatest of formed things,\nWithout the operation of the *xiānmǎn*,\nWould fragment and disperse.\nThus, they rely on the singular principle as their root,\nHence, it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Gēn* (Root) means origin.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\n*Gǔ* (Valley) means nourishment.\nIf one can nourish the spirit, they will not die.\nThe spirit refers to the spirits of the five *zàng* (viscera).\nThe liver houses the *hún* (ethereal soul),\nThe lungs house the *pò* (corporeal soul),\nThe heart houses the spirit,\nThe kidneys house the *jīng* (essence),\nThe spleen houses the *zhì* (willpower).\nWhen the five *zàng* are all injured,\nThe five spirits depart.\n\n**Master Yán said:**\nThe supreme harmony of wondrous *qi*,\nLike a wondrous thing as divine,\nEmptiness as its dwelling,\nSilence as its constant state,\nEntering and exiting without openings,\nComing and going without hindrance,\nIn motion, nothing fails,\nIn stillness, nothing is incomplete,\nTransforming yet not transforming,\nGenerating yet not generating.\n\n**Master Róng said:**\nThe Unending Valley Spirit is the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\nMaster Hé Shànggōng spoke of it as nourishing the spirit,\nWhich is the method of *sǐcún* (thoughtful preservation).\nMaster Fǔsì spoke of the emptiness within the Valley,\nThis is metaphorical language.\nThough the insights of the true and virtuous are lofty,\nThey are all explanations of particulars.\n\nNow, I shall speak of this in terms of principle.\n*Gǔ* (Valley) is emptiness,\n*Xiān* (Profound) is the Dao,\n*Mǎn* (Taem) is stillness.\n\nIf one has form and spirit,\nThen there is life and death.\nIf there is life and death,\nOne cannot speak of the Dao,\nFor it flows and shifts without constancy—\nHow could it be called still?\n\nIf one can empty form and spirit,\nAbandoning the self and objects,\nExiting without root,\nGathering *qi* yet not claiming life,\nEntering without openings,\nDispersing *qi* yet not claiming death—\nNot dying, not living,\nThis is the meaning of the Valley Spirit.\n\nLife and death are ever-present,\nFloating and unstable, lacking substance.\nDeep, feminine, and still,\nSerene and unmoving—\nThis is the meaning of *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*Gǔ* (Valley) is emptiness.\n*Shén* (Spirit) is luminous intelligence.\nMaster Hé Shànggōng said:\n*Gǔ* (Valley) means nourishment,\nSpeaking of how the common people wander through life and death\nDue to their attachment to desires.\nIf one can guide and gather the spirit,\nLike bathing in emptiness,\nWith a pure and unobstructed container,\nThen one will no longer experience life and death.\n\nThis is called the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*Xiān* (Profound) is the name for the unobstructed.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) signifies feminine gentleness.\nTo clarify nourishing the spirit like the Valley,\nSo that it does not die,\nThere is nothing better than stillness, retreat, and feminine gentleness—\nA pure and unobstructed container of singularity.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\nThe Dao of not dying lies in the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n*Xiān* (Profound) is Heaven,\nIn humans, it is the nose.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) is Earth,\nIn humans, it is the [mouth].\nHeaven nourishes humans with the five *qì*,\nEntering through the nose and stored in the heart.\nThe five *qì*, pure and subtle,\nBecome the spirit, clarity, intelligence, sound, and harmony.\nTheir ghost is called *hún* (ethereal soul),\nThe *hún* is masculine,\nControlling entry and exit through the nose,\nCommunicating with Heaven,\nThus the nose is called *xiān* (profound).\n\n*Mǎn* (Taem) is Earth,\nEarth nourishes humans with the five flavors,\nEntering through the mouth and processed by the stomach.\nThe five flavors, coarse and impure,\nBecome the form, flesh, bones, and the six emotions.\nTheir ghost is called *pò* (corporeal soul),\nThe *pò* is feminine,\nGenerated through entry and exit by the mouth,\nCommunicating with Earth,\nThus it is called *mǎn* (taem).\n\n**Master Yán said:**\nThe *mǎn* (taem), though feminine and yielding, can generate the profound,\nLike the distant and unseen yet nurturing as a mother,\nIts form unseen.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThis continues the previous passage.\n*Xiān* (Profound) is the name for the unobstructed.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) signifies feminine gentleness.\nTo clarify nourishing the spirit like the Valley,\nSo that it does not die,\nThere is nothing better than stillness, retreat, and feminine gentleness—\nA pure and unobstructed container of singularity.\n\nThe **Gate of the Profound Taem**—\nThis is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nDeep and mysterious, the empty Taem,\nCapable of mothering all things—\nAll things arise from it,\nThus it is called the **Gate**.\n\nHeaven and Earth have form,\nHence they rely on it as their fundamental root.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:**\nThe function of the Profound Taem—\nWhen stimulated, it responds;\nIts response issues forth to all things,\nThus it is called the **Gate**.\n\nThe **Gate** signifies entry and exit.\nHeaven and Earth, the greatest of formed things,\nWithout the function of the Profound Taem,\nWould fragment and disperse.\nThus, they rely on perceiving the One as their fundamental root—\nHence it is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.\n**Root** means **origin**.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong said:**\nThe **Root** is the **Primordial**.\nSpeaking of the Gate of the Taem,\nThis is where the **Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth** circulates.\n\n**Master Yán said:**\nThe **Great Harmony** generates the One,\nUnborn yet undying,\nEndless yet unceasing—\nOpening and guiding the spirit,\nThis is the **Root and Primordial** of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Master Róng said:**\nThe Dao in stillness is formless and without attributes;\nWhen it moves, the **Earth’s and Heaven’s** phenomena emerge from it,\nThus it is named the **Gate**.\nHeaven and Earth depend on it to generate,\nHence it is called the **Root**.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThis speaks of the profound, unobstructed Dao,\nThe feminine, empty, gentle, and still method,\nCapable of opening and transforming all things,\nGenerating and transforming the Two Polarities—\nThus it is called the **Root**.\n\n**Secondly, it clarifies the unobstructed and unceasing,**\n**Endless as if existing,**\n**Used without exertion.**\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThe function of the empty Taem is subtle and profound,\nIts application as if present,\nIts use without intent—\nThus it does not labor.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:**\n**Endless** means subtly unceasing.\nThe function of the empty Taem is without self-interest.\nSubtle and profound, it is called *as if existing*.\nWithout self-interest, its use is without exertion or fatigue.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong said:**\nEndless as if existing—\nThe nostrils and mouth inhale and exhale,\nShould be subtle and profound,\nAs if existing, yet as if nonexistent.\n**Used without exertion**—\nThe use of qi should be expansive and relaxed,\nNot hurried or labored.\n\n**Master Yán said:**\nDynamic and static, profound and mysterious,\nAs if nonexistent, as if existing,\nAccomplishing things and completing affairs,\nWithout fail—\nShining yet undying,\nUsed without exertion,\nBecause its generation is non-generation,\nIts form is formless.\n\n**Master Róng said:**\n**Endless** means **subtle and profound**.\nThe Dao of the Profound Taem\nIs neither born nor destroyed,\nThe principle of feminine stillness\nIs neither existence nor nonexistence—\nDesiring to speak, yet no form is seen;\nDesiring to vanish, yet all things arise.\nNeither flourishing nor declining,\nNeither constant nor interrupted—\nThus it is called **endless**.\n\n**Exertion** means **toil**.\nObtaining the Dao of the Profound Taem,\nIts application is boundless,\nEffortless and leisurely—\nThus it does not labor.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n**Endless**—a subtle, unbroken appearance.\n**As if**—a semblance.\n**Existing**—having.\n\nIf one speaks of the spirit as empty, this is the view of annihilation;\nIf one speaks of the spirit as having substance, this is the view of permanence.\nEarlier, the emptiness of the spirit was spoken of,\nAnd thus immortality was attained—\nYet still, fearing that students might stagnate in this emptiness,\nNow it is said: *If* it exists,\nTo cure the view of annihilation.\n\nAgain, fearing that students might drown in the having,\nThe word *as if* is appended to cure the view of permanence—\nThus, employing this practice of neither non-existence nor existence,\nThis mind of neither permanence nor interruption,\nAs the essential technique for cultivating the Dao,\nIt is not laborious yet truly authentic.\n\nThus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"To move is to bear the burden of kalpas,\nReflecting on how wearying and toilsome it is—\nMy learning is in having no learning,\nOnly then can one illuminate the natural.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Heaven’s Duration and Earth’s Longevity**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nFor the prior chapter elucidates the Dao of the Profound Taem,\nCapable of establishing the two principles—\nThus, this chapter follows, relying on the two principles,\nAs the method for cultivation.\n\nWithin this chapter, there are three layers:\nFirst, the two principles are directly presented through hypothetical question and answer;\nSecond, the capacity of the Sage’s wisdom and cultivation is briefly revealed;\nThird, a concluding praise of the Sage’s singular eminence is given.\n\n**First: The Two Principles Presented Through Hypothetical Question and Answer**\nThe Three Powers initiate the primordial breath,\nThe Two Principles firmly established—\nThe sun and moon hang their luminous forms,\nStars illuminate the darkness—\nThe Azure Dragon ascends to govern Heaven,\nThe White Steed carries the Earth in motion,\nThunder and lightning display their might,\nQi spreads through yin and yang—\nBorn from the Dao itself,\nThe mother of all things,\nVile yet precious,\nThe Eight Gates where the clay pot flies,\nWisdom that is not foolish,\nThe Master of Shu’s clarity over ten thousand acres.\n\nUnrevealed yet undiminished,\nThe Great Dao thus lends its form—\nEnduring peace, enduring stability,\nWondrous transformations are forged within—\nBeneath, it steadies mountains and valleys;\nAbove, it floats as mist and cloud—\nA pile of eggs unbroken,\nFor its essence is the power of the Great Dao.\n\n**Heaven’s Duration and Earth’s Longevity.**\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nMarking Heaven and Earth’s longevity,\nTo show that without selfishness or contrivance,\nOne can endure and persist—\nThe meaning is fulfilled in the Sage,\nWho transcends the body yet preserves it,\nAchieving private through the abandonment of private.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis marks the chapter’s title—\nHeaven is marked by its qi and phenomena, hence *long*;\nEarth is marked by its form and substance, hence *durable*.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\nSpeaking of Heaven and Earth’s longevity and vitality,\nIt is an analogy for instructing people.\n\n**Master Róng said:**\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nLies in their not self-generating—\nThus they can attain longevity.\n\nThe sun and moon wax and wane,\nTheir cycles of decline and return cannot be halted—\nYin and yang contract and expand,\nThe seasons of cold and heat pass swiftly—\nYet all things are insufficient within them,\nThus the Two Principles alone endure—\nHence, the virtues of Heaven and Earth are marked,\nAnd the reason for their longevity is asked—\nNone but the principle of *wu-xin* (non-selfishness),\nNot self-cultivating in their generation.\n\nIf people can model themselves after Heaven and Earth,\nWith *wu-xin* and not self-cultivating to nourish deeply,\nThen the bones of the immortal will surpass gold and stone,\nAnd eternal blessings will endure—\nBinding the square and round eternally and firmly.\nBut if one cannot abandon right and wrong to align with the Dao,\nOr abandon emotions and desires to congeal the True One—\nThen deaf and blind to sounds and colors,\nNostrils and mouths overwhelmed by fragrance and flavor,\nThe body wearies externally,\nThe mind exhausts internally—\nThen a hundred years are like morning dew,\nA thousand gold like evening cockscomb—\nThus it is said: *People’s disregard for death*\nArises from their not deeply valuing life—\nThus they lightly regard death.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThough the Two Principles are vast,\nThey still have the limit of kalpa’s exhaustion—\nYet within their forms, they slightly extend longevity,\nThus Heaven and Earth are cited to analogize the Sage.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nLies in their not self-generating—\nThus they can attain longevity.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nHeaven and Earth generate all things,\nTheir virtues and applications are vast,\nYet they endure and persist\nBecause they draw from the Dao’s endowment,\nNot arrogating their own creative function—\nThus it is so.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nEarlier, the chapter’s title was marked—\nNow, a hypothetical question is posed.\n\nThe question states:\n*\"Why can Heaven and Earth endure and persist?\"*\nBecause they cover and nourish all things,\nAnd all draw sustenance from the wondrous origin—\nThey do not arrogate their own creative functions,\nThus they can endure and generate all things.\n\nAnother explanation:\n*\"Not self-generating\"* means\nHeaven and Earth merely generate and nourish all things,\nNot enriching their own lives—\nThus they can endure and persist.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nLies in their not self-generating.\nHeaven and Earth alone endure and persist\nBecause they are tranquil and selfless in their actions,\nNot like humans, who anxiously seek their own benefits,\nPlundering others to enrich themselves—\nThus they can endure and persist,\nFor they do not seek life—\nThus they can attain eternal longevity without end.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nIs posed as a hypothetical question to elucidate its meaning—\n*\"Not self-generating\"* is the answer to the prior question,\nExplaining its origin.\n\nIt states:\nHeaven and Earth merely bestow life upon all things,\nNot cultivating their own existence—\nThus they can endure and persist.\n\n**Node Analysis:**\n*Heaven’s Duration* refers to the *níwán* (cranial center),\n*Earth’s Longevity* refers to the *dāntián* (lower elixir field)—\nFrom the *níwán* descending to the *xiàngguān* (palace of light),\nThe *dāntián* ascending in a single flow—\nAbove and below, the primordial *qi* circulates and permeates,\nAll joints are moistened,\nHarmonious *qi* spontaneously arises,\nThe Great Dao is complete—\nThus it is called *long life*.\n\n**Second: Briefly Revealing the Sage’s Wisdom and Cultivation**\nThus, the Sage places his body last yet it is first,\nSets his body aside yet it is preserved.\n\n「**Master’s Annotation:**\nTo place one’s body last means others gladly advance it,\nThus one’s body is first.\nTo set one’s body aside means the heart forgets self-interest,\nThus one’s body is preserved.\n\n**Master’s Commentary:**\nTherefore, the Sage follows the Heaven and Earth’s nurturing,\nEnsuring equitable nourishment without favoritism,\nThus advancing his body first for all to rely upon,\nThe people joyfully depend on him,\nAs the foundation for those below,\nSo his body is first.\nHe does not exalt himself,\nNor does he neglect his own body,\nWhen the world returns to *rén* (benevolence),\nHe fears no harm,\nThus his body is preserved.\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng says:**\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last yet his body is first,\nAdvances others before himself.\nYet his body is first, for the world respects him,\nAdvancing him to positions of authority.\nTo set his body aside is to treat himself lightly while enriching others.\nYet his body is preserved, for the people love him as their parents,\nAnd the *shénmíng* (divine luminaries) protect him like a cherished child,\nThus his body remains eternally preserved.\n\n**Master Yán says:**\nThe Sage’s awe commands the eight directions,\nHis keen insight permeates the four quarters—\nYet his wisdom lies beyond desire,\nHis plans beyond action.\nHe humbles himself to honor Heaven,\nSets himself aside to bring peace to the people,\nThus without action he achieves,\nWithout words he is trusted,\nAll wish to serve him as their lord,\nSo he advances others.\nHe reverses his own inclinations to follow the Dao,\nSets aside his own interests to bring peace to the people—\nHis merit is boundless, yet unseen,\nHis virtue towering, yet unheard.\nHis transformation flows with the divine luminaries,\nHis lifespan aligns with the mountains and rivers,\nThus his body is preserved.\n\n**Harmony with the Dao.**\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nTherefore, the Sage—\nFew forget their emotions and still their *jī* (mechanisms),\nMany pursue song and deviate from truth—\nOnly the Sage can enact this.\nPracticing humility to dwell behind all things,\nHis exalted virtue thus dwells first.\nPreserving the Dao, he sets his body aside yet his body remains,\nHis own essence ascends to merge with the analogy.\nThe Sage is he who aligns with Heaven and Earth’s virtue,\nSetting forth his lofty conduct as a model for all.\nTo place his body last is to first grant others passage.\nYet his body is first, transcending the *sānjiè* (Three Realms).\nTo set his body aside is to fortify his limbs.\nYet his body is preserved, attaining *long life*.\n**Third section concludes with praise for the Sage’s unique and noble virtue.**\nIs it not because he has no private interests?\nThus he fulfills his own private essence.»\n\nThe **Commentary** states:\nHeaven and Earth forget their nurturing function—this is *wu si* (no private interest).\nYet they endure long and vast—this is fulfilling their own private essence.\nThe Sage sets aside and transcends his body—this is *wu si*,\nYet he is first and preserved—this is fulfilling his own private essence.\n\n**Commentary on the Commentary** says:\nHeaven and Earth endure long, the Sage is first and preserved—\nIs it not because they have no selfish intent,\nYet achieve this enduring, first-preserved private essence?\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says:\nIs it not because of their *wu si*?\nThe Sage is loved by people, favored by the numinous—\nIs it not because of his impartiality and *wu si*?\nThus he fulfills his own private essence.\n\nWhat others call *si* (private),\nIs to enrich oneself in desire.\nThe Sage, without *si*, yet himself is enriched—\nThus he fulfills his own private essence.\n\n**Master Rong** says:\nOrdinary beings are mired in desires, their spirit obscured,\nLacking absolute impartiality, harboring partiality.\nThey exalt themselves while burdening others,\nHoard for their own bodies while neglecting people,\nDesire to lead yet cannot transcend others,\nSeek preservation yet their bodies perish.\n\nThe Sage, without intent, desires to dwell first—\nNaturally he is first.\nWithout desires, seeks firm preservation—\nNaturally he is preserved.\nThus it is said: he fulfills his own private essence.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\nThis is his *wu shī* (no selfhood),\nThus he fulfills his *shī* (selfhood).\n*Shī* is the master—\nThe Sage, observing all things, sees emptiness in self and name,\nBoth void—\nThus he can set himself aside and lead others,\nForget self to aid others—\nThus he has no master.\nYet it is said he fulfills his *shī*—\nIn praise of the Sage’s virtue harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,\nLike a straw dog for the people,\nThus alone he dwells in the Three Realms’ exalted position,\nFulfilling the transformation of Heaven and humanity.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eight: The Chapter on Supreme Virtue**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nFor the prior chapter briefly illuminated the conduct of forgetting self,\nYet did not reveal its efficacy—\nThus this chapter expounds further,\nExtolling the person of forgetting self,\nWho possesses extraordinary abilities and wondrous functions.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct meanings unfold:\nFirst, it establishes *shàngshàn* (supreme virtue) with two analogies—law and metaphor.\nSecond, it broadly enumerates three abilities, elaborating seven virtues.\nThird, it concludes with praise for gentleness and weakness,\nThus free from blemish.\n\n**First: Establishing Supreme Virtue with Two Analogies**\nSupreme virtue is profound and mysterious,\nThe true essence, its secrets hidden.\nIt mirrors all phenomena in emptiness,\nGives birth to the Three Powers in spontaneity.\nThe gateway to all wonders,\nWhere all life converges,\nThe threshold of tranquil forgetting,\nWhere inert beings proliferate.\nHow shall we liken it?\nLike water filling a vessel to its brim,\nBecoming the boundless sea’s surging tide,\nLike the *Wèilú* Mountains containing the Yellow River’s flood,\nDraining the earth—\nThough vast and unfathomable,\nYet serene and supremely yielding,\nCleansing filth from the world,\nPreserving clarity within its nature.\nThus the Way’s function may be approached:\n**Supreme virtue is like water.**\n\n**Commentary** says:\nTo illuminate the Sage’s supreme virtue,\nWater’s nature is taken as an analogy to the Dao.\n\n**Commentary on the Commentary** says:\n*Shàngshàn* (supreme virtue) marks the person.\n*Ruò shuǐ* (like water) is the metaphor.\nThe Sage’s emptiness embraces all—\nWithout clinging to the law, yet virtue arises—\nThis is virtue’s summit.\n\nThe Sage’s conduct, like water’s function,\nIn the following text, all align with law and metaphor.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says:\nThe person of supreme virtue is like water’s nature.\n\n**Master Rong** says:\nSupreme virtue is like water—\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people revile,\nThus it nears the Dao.\nIts principles are profound and distant,\nHard to fathom—\nThe virtuous cultivating the Way,\nTheir actions are subtle and wondrous,\nThus water is borrowed as metaphor.\n\nWater nourishes things, the Dao aids people—\nThus it is said to benefit.\nWater yields to obstacles, the Dao is vast and equal—\nThus it is said not to contend.\nPeople often revile what is low, yet water flows downward,\nThe Dao practices humility—\nThus it is said to dwell where others revile.\n*Jì* (near)—water’s nature nears the Dao,\nThus it is taken as analogy.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\nWater has two kinds—\nOne clings, one forgets—\nThis is forgetting virtue, thus called supreme.\nWater has many uses,\nThus it is paired as analogy.\nIts functions and virtues are listed below.\n\n**Master Jié’s Explanation** says:\n*Shàn* (virtue) refers to the *jīn* (saliva).\nRinsing with it yields sweet dew,\nSwallowing it benefits all spirits.\nIf you wish to practice this,\nMorning and evening, rinse the *Huá Chí* (Jade Pool),\nFilling your mouth with saliva,\nThen tilt your head to swallow,\nBenefiting all spirits and enriching your essence.\n\n---\n**Second: Broadly Enumerating Three Abilities, Elaborating Seven Virtues**\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people revile—\nThus it nears the Dao.\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*Jì* (near) means close.\n\n**Commentary on the Commentary** says:\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people revile—\nWater’s nature is sweet and cool,\nScattering everywhere, its dew nourishes all.\nThose it benefits grow—\nThus it is said to benefit—this is its first ability.\nUnder Heaven, none are softer than water,\nYet it can be modeled—\nIts clarity reflects others,\nFlowing, it submits to obstacles,\nFollowing its course—\nIt never contends—this is its second ability.\nIt reviles low places, yet people flock there—\nWater accepts filth, dwells in evil without complaint—this is its third ability.\nThus it nears the Dao—*jì* (near) means close.\nBenefiting others shows its vast efficacy,\nNot contending reveals its gentleness,\nDwelling in evil demonstrates its tolerance of defilement—\nThese are water’s three abilities,\nWhich the Sage embodies as one.\nHis conduct is not far from the Dao—\nThus it is said he is near.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says:\nWater benefits all things—\nIn Heaven, it is mist and dew;\nOn Earth, it is springs and rivers.\nYet it does not contend,\nDwelling where people revile—\nPeople revile what is low, damp, and filthy,\nYet water alone flows quietly there.\nThus it nears the Dao—\nWater’s nature nearly aligns with the Dao.\n\n「○ Cheng Shu [Master Cheng’s commentary] says:\nWater excels in benefiting all things—\nIt is mist and dew in Heaven,\nSprings and rivers on Earth,\nMoistening and nourishing all,\nIts efficacy widespread.\nThus it is likened to the Sage’s virtue.\n\nThe Sage’s virtue responds to all things,\nHis benevolent deeds are flexible and expedient,\nHis skillful means open and transform—\nTheir meaning aligns with water’s nature,\nHence the comparison.\n\nAgain, water does not contend—\nIts nature is gentle and yielding,\nIt does not vie with others,\nAdapting to square or round vessels,\nFilling or receding as people will.\nThe Sage’s highest conduct,\nIn responding to all things, is likewise.\n\nIt dwells in what people revile—\nWhat they revile are lowly places,\nAnd water alone resides there.\nPeople all seek the high and despise the low,\nTheir arrogance tramples others,\nYet the Sage alone forsakes the high to embrace the low,\nGentle, yielding, and still.\n\nThus it nears the Dao—*jì* (near) means close—\nHis conduct embodies these three abilities,\nHence it is near the Dao.\nWith the three abilities now explained,\nNext, the seven virtues are revealed.\n\n**Residing in the Virtuous Land**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nThe Sage’s highest virtue,\nIn his gentle and yielding conduct,\nIs like water dwelling in low places,\nNourishing all things.\nThe land is humble in its use,\nWater favors flowing downward—\nThus it is said the Sage resides in the virtuous land.\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s dwelling,\nExemplifies vast beneficence.\nLike water on Earth,\nIt brings abundant benefit to all.\nAgain, the land’s virtue lies in its humility,\nWater flows downward naturally,\nMatching the Sage’s meekness and compliance,\nNearly aligning with the Dao’s gentle nature—\nThus it is said he resides in the virtuous land.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nWater’s nature harmonizes with the land—\nAbove grass and trees, it flows downward,\nLike transformation, its movement subjugates all.\n\n**Rong says:**\nWater does not discriminate in its flow,\nIt moves wherever it is placed—\nThe Sage’s path is always virtuous.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nWater’s nature favors the low,\nFinding peace in downward flow.\nThe Sage’s highest virtue lies in humility,\nFor humility is auspicious—\nThus he dwells in low places,\nCalled the land of *non-contention*.\n\n**The Heart is Virtuous in Depth**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nA virtuous heart is deep and still,\nLike water’s settled clarity.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s heart,\nExemplifies profound tranquility—\nLike water’s nature,\nResting as a pure spring.\nWater’s stillness reveals its clarity,\nA quiet heart attains insight.\n\nThus it is said the heart is virtuous in depth.\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nWater’s heart is empty and profound,\nIts depths clear and bright.\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater’s heart is still yet clear,\nA human heart is empty yet reflective.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nDepth means still water—\nWater’s settled purity is clean and bright,\nIts depths unfathomable.\nThe Sage’s heart is like a boundless spring,\nStill yet illuminating—\nThus still water reflects all things,\nAn empty heart perceives all objects.\n\n**Generosity is Virtuous in Benevolence**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nGenerosity in giving aligns with the utmost benevolence,\nLike water’s nourishment of all things.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s vast compassion,\nAlways extends to others.\nGenerosity’s essence harmonizes with benevolent conduct,\nLike water’s nourishment—\nIt bestows without favor or aversion,\nThus it is said generosity is virtuous in benevolence.\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nAll things rely on water to thrive,\nIt gives to the empty, not the full.\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater harmonizes with all things,\nHumans benefit the common folk.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nBenevolence means grace—\nWater’s nature clings and moistens,\nIts grace nourishes all things.\nThe Sage’s virtue is compassionate and saving,\nHis grace extends to all beings—\nCompassion knows no bounds of enmity or kinship,\nMoistening does not discriminate between cold or foul.\n\n**Speech is Virtuous in Faithfulness**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nWords spoken are true and real,\nLike water’s flow through perilous paths,\nNever failing in its truth.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s highest speech,\nWords must be true and real,\nGuiding the common folk toward transformation,\nHis faithfulness never deceives.\n\nLike flowing springs,\nDo they differ from treacherous ravines?\nThus it is said speech is virtuous in faithfulness.\nThe annotation states: *Water flows through perilous paths yet never loses its truth*—\nThis is the language of the *Zhou Yi* [Book of Changes] on *Kǎn* [the hexagram of danger].\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nWater’s inner reflection mirrors all forms,\nIts clarity never falters.\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater’s reflection of things,\nBeauty or ugliness, never distorts their form.\nThe benevolent in speech,\nTheir words never diverge from their truth.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nFaithfulness means reality—\nWater can purify and reveal all appearances,\nBeauty or ugliness, without deception.\nThe Sage’s words validate truth,\nTheir faithfulness is like a seal’s verification—\nEven the tides of the sea,\nThree times daily, never fail their appointed hour.\nMuch more so the Sage’s wisdom,\nWhich discerns all things,\nNever neglecting the three categories of beings.\n\n**Governance is Virtuous in Rectification**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nGovernance excels in proper ordering,\nLike water’s cleansing of all things,\nMaking them pure and cold.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nGovernance means uprightness—\nThe Sage in his affairs,\nActs without contrivance,\nHis uprightness guides all things,\nAnd all things follow naturally.\nUprightness brings self-ordering,\nWhat else could be called virtuous?\nLike water’s nature,\nIt cleanses all things,\nMaking them pure and serene—\nThus it is said governance is virtuous in rectification.\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nThere is nothing water does not cleanse,\nIts purity is vast and even.\n\n*Rong says:*\nGreat peace is none greater than still water,\nNo partiality exceeds the Sage’s virtue.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nWater’s nature is level and without bias,\nThe Sage’s heart is upright and rectifies all evil.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*In the midst of balance, the standard is set—\nThe great artisan takes his measure from it.*\n\n**Capability is Virtuous in Skillfulness**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nIn all affairs, his capability is skillful,\nLike water’s nature—\nSquare or round, it adapts to the vessel,\nNeither hindered nor obstructed by things.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s clarity and insight,\nIn all things, are without hindrance.\nWhatever there is to move or act,\nIn all affairs, he is proficient.\nProficiency is skillfulness,\nThis is his illuminated understanding.\nLike water’s nature,\nIt becomes a river when flowing,\nA pond when obstructed—\nSupporting boats, embracing emptiness,\nIt accomplishes all things—\nThis is its skillfulness.\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nIt can be square or round,\nCurved or straight, as form demands.\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater’s lack of use makes it unformed,\nYet the Sage’s purpose is never incomplete.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nWater’s nature is multifaceted in its capabilities,\nAdapting to all affairs for benefit.\nThe Sage’s wisdom is insightful yet yielding,\nHis success comes from aligning with things.\n\n**The Way’s Seven Virtues**—\nThus water’s three abilities,\nAnd the Sage’s seven virtues,\nAre nearly one in essence.\nHis conduct is not far from the Dao—\nThus it is said he is near.»\n\n**The Way’s Virtues in Motion**\n\n**Timely Action**\n*Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:*\nThings respond and react—\nwhen it does not fail its season,\nit is like water:\nspring it flows, winter it congeals.\n\n*Master He’s Exegesis:*\nThe Perfect One’s heart\nis like the hollow valley,\nlike a mirror’s reflection—\nwhen things stimulate it, it responds.\nLike water’s nature:\nspring it rises, winter it congeals,\nebbing and flowing with the seasons.\nThus it is said: *Timely Action.*\n\n*Master He Shang Gong:*\nSummer it scatters, winter it congeals—\nresponding to stimuli, never missing the cosmic time.\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater congeals in winter, flows in summer,\nnever erring in its rhythms.\nThe Sage acts in accord with the seasons—\nnever failing what is proper.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:*\nWater congeals in winter, releases in summer,\nflowing and solidifying with the times.\nHow much more so the Sage’s insightful, empty wisdom—\nresponding as things arise,\nobserving the moment, acting or stilling,\nnever failing in what is fitting.\nEmerging or retiring, speaking or silent—\ndual yet one.\n\n*The Seven Virtues’ Conclusion:*\nThis is how the Sage practices the Dao to govern himself,\ndiscarding deceit and falsehood,\nestablishing norms for later sages.\nThese seven virtues\nall arise from a single action—\nwithin form, the myriad spirits act of their own accord.\n\n**Third Virtue: Gentle Weakness**\nThus without blemish.\n\n**The Virtue of Non-Contention**\n*Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:*\nThe highest virtue is empty-hearted,\nyielding to things—\nlike water’s nature:\nobstructed, it stops; unobstructed, it flows.\nIt neither resists nor opposes things,\nso there is no fault or blame.\n\n*Master He’s Exegesis:*\n*Fault* means *transgression*.\nThe Perfect One’s conduct is flawless,\nharmonizing with things without injury,\nempty-hearted yet complete,\nnever competing or contending.\nIts currents ebb and flow,\nsubmissive and yielding—\nnever resisting things,\nso there is no fault or blame.\n\n*Master He Shang Gong:*\nOnly by not contending\ndoes it stop when obstructed, flow when unobstructed—\nyielding to others.\nThus there is no fault.\nWater’s nature is such—\nthe world has no grievance against water.\n\n*Yan says:*\nHuman nature is gentle, weak in defense,\ndescending from high to low,\nbearing insult like the earth,\ncontaining filth like the sea.\nIts words conform to others’ hearts,\nits body follows behind.\nWhat others detest,\nit alone endures—\nserene as if without thought,\ndrifted upon as if without end.\nIts transformations are ever-changing,\nflowing and stilling with the Dao,\nabandoning self, following things—\nnothing surpasses water.\nIf the Sage-King embodies this,\nusing it to govern,\nhis virtue is subtle and profound—\nwhat fault could there be?\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater has no will of its own.\nIf one empties oneself,\nnot aligning with things,\nas previously explained—\nonly water and the Sage, by not contending,\nare capable of contending.\nThis is the natural Way.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:*\nOnly by righteousness, emptiness, gentleness, and yielding\nis there no fault or transgression.\n\n*End of Volume Two of the *Dao De Jing’s* Profound Virtue and Its Revered Commentary*\n*Beginning of Volume Three of the *Dao De Jing’s* Profound Virtue and Its Compiled Commentary*\n\n「Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary and Exegesis\n—Master He Shanggong’s *Strict* Commentary, Lord Yan Junping’s *Righteous* Commentary, Master Li Rong’s *Illuminating* Commentary,\n—Master Xi Hua’s *Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning*, Master Mengyang Qiangsi’s *Compiled Commentary*\n\n**Chapter Nine: *Hold Yet Overflow***\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, for the prior expounded on the supreme excellence of *wuwei* (non-action) and the Way’s highest virtue—emptying oneself to benefit others. Thus, this chapter reveals the perils of worldly desires and self-inflicted blame, the reasons for which it follows. Here, one chapter unfolds three distinct teachings:\n\n1. **The dangers of clinging to desires with a fixed heart—prone to ruin.**\n2. **Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting calamity.**\n3. **Only humility, gentleness, and quiet retreat align with the Dao.**\n\n**1. The dangers of clinging to desires with a fixed heart—prone to ruin.**\nThe heavens and earth are vast crucibles of divine transformation, yet even their luminous forms—moon and sun—abide by the measure of waxing and waning, lest they falter. Mountains and rivers stand deep and firm, yet they endure the fate of collapse and exhaustion. How much more so we, mere mortals, who dare to grasp at fullness? We stamp our feet in the realm of sound and color, indulging our hearts in the duality of self and other. Our minds teem with wicked seeds, yet we remain blind to their absence of clarity; our hearts bristle with malevolent intent, yet we persist in delusion, secure and undisturbed. Like infants wailing in their cradles, we rise from the Three Palaces to lodge our complaints; like bones exposed to the elements, we drift through the Nine Abysses, unrecognized. The folly of a mortal’s life is thus inverted—truly blind, yet unseeing, and how deeply pitiable!\n\n**To hold yet overflow is not as good as simply ceasing.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* Grasping at fullness and overflow, preventing their loss, only burdens one with wealth—regret and stinginess arise thereafter. Thus, it is better to cease.\nCease means *to stop*.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* **Hold** is *to grasp*; **overflow** is *fullness*; **cease** is *to stop*.\nThe human heart, greedy and loving desires, endlessly seeks and takes, grasping and preserving to ensure fullness. Yet wealth becomes a burden, and regret and stinginess fester anew. Therefore, the Sage warns: *Better to rest than to persist*.\n\n*He Shanggong says:* Overflow is fullness; cease is to stop. To grasp at fullness guarantees its loss—better to stop.\n\n*Yan Junping says:* When one pollutes the paths of all beings with political schemes and the accumulation of wealth, the heavier the riches, the more one’s spirit and clarity are depleted. Wealth and gain, piling up, only breed the guilt of life and death—far better to cease before fullness is reached.\n\n*Li Rong says:* A tilted vessel, filled to the brim, must topple; excess and indulgence, once overflowing, must fail. If one wishes to avoid ruin and defeat, only humility and restraint suffice.\n\n*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* **Hold** is *to grasp*; **overflow** is *fullness*; **cease** is *to stop*.\nThose who cannot retreat in quietude nor embrace humility, who persist in grasping and seeking fullness, who boast of their greatness and scheme to overpower others—such folly will surely invite ruin. Better to stop than to act.\n\nThus, the *Zhuangzi* states: *\"Fill to the brim, and it will topple and perish.\"* And the *Book of Documents* says: *\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit.\"*\n\n**To probe yet sharpen is not long-enduring.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* To measure and sharpen one’s ambitions, pursuing honor and fame, will inevitably breed arrogance—sitting thus invites misfortune and blame. Hence, it cannot endure long.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* **Probe** is *to measure*; **sharpen** is *to whet*.\nWhen mundane emotions are sluggish and drowned, one clings to the pursuit of honor and gain. Thus, one measures past events, whets the heart’s desires, and invites the resentment of ghosts and men—sitting in such folly will surely bring misfortune and blame. Hence, it cannot endure long.\n\n*He Shanggong says:* **Probe** is *to govern*; one first governs by probing, yet later must abandon it.\n\n*Yan Junping says:* To whet one’s heart and sharpen one’s resolve, to strategize with cunning—when one’s wisdom grows sharp and one’s rank and reputation swell, one’s vitality wanes while the body advances. How can such a state endure long?\n\n*Li Rong says:* Honor invites censure; prosperity invites weariness. A sharp mind that stands out among others will be scorned by men—how can it endure long?\n\n*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* **Probe** is *to polish*; **sharpen** is *to refine*.\nTo polish a blade or whet a tool—though refined, they must surely wear. How much more so when one polishes and sharpens one’s own heart, demanding only of others, whose harm is greater than that of weapons? All things are my inferior, yet I persist—how can such folly endure long?\n\n*Commentary by Mengyang Qiangsi:* The upper **probe** refers to reckless speech; the lower **probe** refers to scattered spirit. Reckless speech invites war and strife; scattered spirit invites decay and loss—teeth falling, hair turning white.\n\n**2. Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting calamity.**\nGold and jade fill the halls—yet none can guard them.\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* This reveals that overflow cannot be long preserved.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Even if one ceaselessly demands and takes, filling halls with gold and jade—like the sun with teeth yet burning its own body, or the rooster with fear yet having its tail cut—one will lose the very treasures one sought to hoard, inviting the woes of bandits. How can such folly be guarded? This reverses the meaning of *holding yet overflowing*.\n\n*Commentary by Mengyang Qiangsi:* Without blood, there is no gold; without essence, there is no jade. If one can cultivate the *One*, the upper and lower will flow freely—rumbling within the belly like thunder, limbs and joints supported, eyes bright and responsive, in harmony with the *One*.\n\n*He Shanggong says:* Lustful desires weary the spirit; wealth burdens the body.\n\n*Yan Junping says:* Wealth and honor, like ice and coal—both cannot coexist. Honor and power are defilements of the spirit; gain and wealth are harms to the body. To nourish the spirit’s defilements and accumulate the body’s harms is to diminish the means of one’s flourishing while fostering the causes of one’s ruin. The more one gains in wealth, the more one’s *qi* is exhausted—how can it be guarded?\n\n*Li Rong says:* Gold and jade have no feet, yet they scatter of their own accord. Fire and water’s disasters cannot be repelled; bandits and thieves cannot be warded off. Thus, it is known: to hoard and gather is to lose the Way; to disperse and give is to conform with the Dao.\n\n*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* Desires excessive, the spirit grows weary; wealth accumulated, the body labors. When both body and mind are thus strained, none can guard them. Moreover, if one hoards without dispersing, great thieves will surely come. Within, one harbors grief and sorrow; without, one’s grasp weakens. When the body perishes, the wealth remains—thus, none can guard it.»\n\n---\n\nWealth and honor yet proud—one invites one’s own calamity.\n*Imperial Commentary:* This reveals the sharpness that cannot be measured.\nPride arises from the heart, hence the retribution comes not from others.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Heru* (遗), to bestow. Wealth invites others’ pursuit, hence one easily deceives things.\nHonor invites subservience, hence one takes to domineering others.\nWhen arrogance and excess reach their height, misfortune comes—who can blame?\nBecause of pride, retribution arises; pride stems from the heart—thus it is said, \"one invites it oneself.\"\nThis is the reversal of measuring sharpness.\n\n*River Above Master* says: When wealthy, one should relieve the poor; when honored, one should pity the lowly. Yet to indulge in pride and licentiousness is to invite disaster.\n\n*Yan* says: To be wealthy and honored yet not proud is easy to speak but hard to practice. The higher one’s station, the loftier one’s aspirations—yet to be proud in wealth and honor is like a torch meeting fire: the brighter the door, the faster the flame consumes. How can one not be cautious?\n\n*Li Rong* says: Accumulated wealth, if not dispersed, and riding honor to oppress others—retribution arises from within, not from without.\n\n*Cheng Exegesis:* *Jiu* (咎), an omen. *Heru* (遗), to bestow. Those in wealth and honor ought to aid others, yet failing to be modest, they grow ever more arrogant and swollen, bringing ruin upon themselves—how could it concern others?\n\n*Concise Explanation:* It speaks of those in wealth and honor who covet fame, riches, and bribes, unwilling to cultivate the Dao, until death comes. Even if one hoards money to the heavens, what use is it to the body? When the body dies, the name perishes. Only through humility, gentleness, and retreat does one align with the Dao of Heaven.\n\nWhen achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled, retreat is the Way of Heaven.\n*Imperial Commentary:* Those whose achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled should withdraw to decline prominence—this is not yet the Dao of Heaven. Only by observing the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness can one be free from worry and rest.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* This is a warning. Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit. Even Heaven does not remain perpetually full, so those whose achievements are complete meet ruin, and those whose reputation is fulfilled suffer decline. To seek enduring preservation—no such words have been heard. One must forget merit and step back, withdrawing from prominence like the Dao of Heaven, never losing the balance of fullness and emptiness, thus free from blame and worry.\n\n*River Above Master* says: When a person’s deeds are accomplished and reputation established, if they do not withdraw and avoid their position, they will surely meet disaster—this is the constant Dao of Heaven. Like the sun at its zenith moving on, the moon at fullness waning, things at their peak declining, and extreme joy turning to sorrow.\n\n*Li Rong* says: Yin and yang succeed one another; cold and heat shift in turn—this is the constant principle of things, the eternal Dao of Heaven. If one clings to honor without retreat, disaster follows. The exegeses thus perceive the signs; the Four Worthies departed in understanding, aligning with the principles of things and the Dao of Heaven.\n\n*Cheng Exegesis:* Heaven is the natural order. The sun at its zenith declines; the moon at fullness wanes—waning and fullness alternate, extremes reverse—this is their constant nature. Thus, those whose worldly achievements are complete and whose reputation is fulfilled must guard their station, know contentment, practice humility, gentleness, and retreat, dwelling in uncompetitive places, avoiding harm, and preserving life. Only thus do they deeply align with the true Dao of Heaven. Those whose achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled must withdraw and refine their conduct, acting naturally.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: Nurturing the Vital Essence (载营魄)**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous, which broadly expounded the faults of arrogance and the virtue of humility and retreat. Yet regarding the practice of the Dao’s path, its methods were still incomplete. Thus, this chapter elaborates on the inner and outer practices, detailing their functions step by step. Its meaning is divided into three parts: first, it clarifies restraining the spirit and subduing the vital essence, focusing on inner cultivation; second, it broadly displays the conduct of governing the state and benefiting others; third, it reveals the beauty of attaining the Dao and forgetting merit.\n\n**First: Restraining the Spirit and Subduing the Vital Essence, Guarding Oneness in Inner Cultivation**\n\nJust as rare trees flourish with fragrance and forest flowers bloom with charm, it is because their roots are deep and their stems firm, drawing nourishment from the dew. So too for humanity: the spirit and vital essence must be nourished, preserving harmonious *qi* to self-moisten, guarding humility and gentleness to achieve completion.\n\nWhen snow falls thickly, one must endure the toil of coming and going;\nWhen the rooster crows, one must add to the diligence of night and day.\nOne must ensure the vital essence and spirit are harmonious and at peace,\nLest the mind and spirit scatter and stray.\nKnow that Ziji controlled the white crane to part the clouds,\nOnly then did he realize the Master’s lute, riding the red carp, soared to the Han.\nIf one abandons true essence for mundane affairs,\nThe Dao’s sorrow is profound—how dark the common folk’s ignorance!\n\nNurturing the vital essence and embracing oneness—how could it ever depart?\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* At the beginning of life, the vital essence is called *po* (魄); once born, the *po* becomes *hun* (魂) with the rise of yang. The *po* is yin and empty, the *hun* is yang and full. It speaks of the initial bearing of empty *po*, which must constantly be nurtured and protected to restore yang. When yang *qi* fills the *po*, it becomes *hun*; if the *hun* can move, life is complete. *One* means \"unrestrained.\" To restore yang and preserve life, one must not be contaminated—thus, one must embrace and guard pure oneness, lest it depart from the body.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Zai* (载), initial. *Ying* (营), to protect. It says that at the start of life, one is but an empty form; once the *po* is born, yang *qi* fills the empty *po*. If the *po* can move, it is called *hun*—like the moon’s reflection illuminating the sun, generating light. Thus, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Zichan said: \"At the beginning of life, the vital essence is called *po*; once the *po* is born, yang becomes *hun.\"* It speaks of the initial bearing of empty *po*, which must be nurtured and protected, constantly ensuring yang *qi* fills it, thus preserving life. If movement is irregular and yang *qi* is dissipated, it reverts to empty *po* and perishes. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The mind near death must not restore yang.\" Thus, one must nurture and protect the empty *po*, restoring yang to preserve life, embracing and guarding pure oneness, lest it be contaminated—then life is complete. This teaches the nourishment of the spirit.\n\n*River Above Master* says: *Zai ying po* (载营魄), *ying* is *hun* (魂).\n\n「The human being bears *hun* and *po* above, and thereby sustains life—this must be cherished and nourished.\nJoy and anger harm the *hun*; sudden fright harms the *po*.\nThe *hun* resides in the liver, the *po* in the lungs.\nRich wine and sweetness corrupt the liver and lungs,\nso when the *hun* is tranquil, one’s resolve in the Dao remains undisturbed,\nand when the *po* is secure, longevity and extended years are attained.\nCan one not depart from *oneness*?\nIt is said that if one can embrace *oneness*,\nkeeping it ever-present within oneself, then one may endure forever.\n*Oneness* is the Dao’s initial manifestation,\nthe essence of *Great Harmony* (太和),\nhence it is called *oneness*.\n\nIt is proclaimed throughout the world:\nthe heavens attain *oneness* and thereby become clear,\nthe earth attains *oneness* and thereby becomes settled,\nand sovereigns attain *oneness* to establish righteousness.\nWithin, it becomes the heart;\nwithout, it becomes conduct.\nWhen it is dispersed, it is called *application* (施);\nin totality, it is called *oneness*.\nThe term *oneness* means\na singular resolve with no duplicity.\n\n**Honor** says:\n*Load* (载) means *circulate*.\n*Camp* (营) means *protect*.\n*Po* (魄) is the vital spirit of the body.\n*Oneness* is the Dao.\nThe human being is the Dao’s vehicle,\nhence it is said to *load*.\nA pure body ensures *hun* and *po* are secure;\na turbid heart drives away the true spirit.\nWith contemplation and vigilance, one guards the spirit,\nhence it is said to *camp*.\nThe mind must not be divided,\nhence it is said to be *one*.\nWhen wisdom aligns with the Dao,\nthe spirit harmonizes with the form,\nhence it is said that there is no *departure*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\n*Load hun and po* (载营魄):\n*Load* (载) means *circulate*.\n*Camp hun* (营魂) is the yang spirit, urging one toward goodness.\n*Po* (魄) is the yin spirit, urging one toward vice.\nThus, the *hun* is restless yet inclined toward life,\nwhile the *po* is tranquil, desiring detachment from birth and death.\nMoreover, the *hun*’s nature is bold and vigorous,\nprone to receiving joy and anger,\nwhile the *po*’s nature is yielding and passive,\nprone to receiving fright and terror.\nFright, terror, joy, and anger\nall diminish the vital spirit.\nHence, at the outset of cultivating the Dao,\none must first restrain the *hun* and subdue the *po*,\npreventing their unrestrained movement.\nIf one can embrace *oneness* without departing,\n*embrace* (抱) means *guard*,\n*oneness* refers to the *three-in-one* (三一),\n*departure* (离) means *scatter*.\nHaving restrained the *hun* and subdued the *po*,\none must next guard the *three-in-one* spirit,\nkeeping it empty, tranquil, and concentrated,\nso that it does not scatter.\nCan one focus the *qi* to attain softness,\nas with an infant?\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation** says:\nTo focus the *succinct qi* (冲气),\nmaking it harmonious and soft like an infant,\nwithout discrimination—\nthis is the teaching of nourishing *qi*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\n*Focus* (专) means *concentrated focus*.\n*Qi* (气) is the Dao.\n*Attain* (致) means *obtain*.\n*Softness* (柔) is *harmony*.\nIt is merely to concentrate on the Dao’s *qi*,\nobtaining the principle of harmonious softness,\nhence like an infant’s lack of desire.\nCan one purify and clarify *mystic vision* (玄览),\nand thereby be free of flaws?\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation** says:\n*Purify* (涤) means *wash*.\n*Clarify* (除) means *order*.\n*Mystic vision* (玄览) is the heart’s illumination.\n*Flaws* (疵) are *illnesses*.\nTo wash and order the heart’s illumination,\nmaking it pure and clear,\nso that desires do not arise,\nand one may be free of illness—\nthis is the teaching of refining the heart.\n\n**River Above Master** says:\n*Purify and clarify mystic vision* (涤除玄览),\none must wash the heart,\nmaking it pristine and pure.\nThe heart dwells in the *mystic void* (玄冥),\nperceiving all things,\nhence it is called *mystic vision*.\nCan one be free of flaws?\nIt means not indulging in licentiousness.\n**Honor** says:\nTo bathe in the *mystic flow* (玄流) and wash the heart—*purify* (涤).\nTo sway the *numinous breeze* (灵风) and dispel burdens—*clarify* (除).\nWithin and without, perfectly pure,\nlike the clarity of a mirror in water,\nand in integrity, without blemish,\ncutting off the defects of jade and pearl.\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\n*Purify* (涤) means *wash*.\n*Clarify* (除) means *dispel*.\n*Mystic vision* (玄览) is *perception*.\n*Flaws* (疵) are *illnesses*.\nTo purify and dispel the *six palaces* (六府),\nand clarify the *five emotions* (五情),\nthe spirit and *qi* become empty and mystic,\nhence one may perceive subtle principles,\nand within and without, be serene,\nfree of illness.\n\n**The Second Section Illuminates the Broad and Manifest Practices of Governing and Benefiting the People.**\nTo cherish the people and govern the realm,\ncan one act without *action* (為)?\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation** says:\nTo cherish and nourish the myriad people,\nto oversee state affairs,\ncan one act without *action*?\nIt should be natural and self-transforming.\nFrom above, one circulates and protects *po*—\nall are released to cultivate the self.\nWhen the self is cultivated, *virtue* is complete,\nhence one may be their sovereign.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\n*Cherishing the people* (爱民)\nmeans ensuring they do not suffer sudden violence,\nand laboring without harming their nature.\n*Governing the realm* (治国)\nmeans prioritizing agriculture and valuing grain,\nsimplifying affairs and avoiding excess,\nso that the people find ease in life,\nand order is achieved without words.\nThis is *non-action* (无为).\nCan one attain it?\n\n**River Above Master** says:\n*Cherishing the people and governing the realm* (爱民治国):\nOne who governs the self cherishes *qi* and thereby preserves the body;\none who governs the realm cherishes the people and thereby secures the state.\nCan one act without *knowledge*?\nIn governing the self, one breathes in the refined *qi*,\nwithout letting it be heard by the ears.\nIn governing the realm, one dispenses *virtue* and bestows benevolence,\nwithout letting the subjects know of it.\n\n**Honor** says:\nThe sovereign cannot self-transform,\nand must rely on others to transform.\nThe principles of things and human affairs depend on tranquility—\nonly those who act with *action* (有為) are restless and harm things;\nthose who act without *action* (無為) are tranquil and cherish the people.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\nHaving already perfected the Dao for self-benefit,\none must now apply it to others.\nThe most urgent practice is to govern the realm and cherish the people.\n*Knowledge* (知) is discriminative wisdom.\nCompassionate and merciful nurturing is called *cherishing the people*,\nand implementing policies to transform is called *governing the realm».*\n\n「Thus, in governing the realm, one must display one’s sincerity and simplicity,\nand teach *non-action* (無為).\nOne must extinguish their deceitful and perverse ways,\nand block all discriminative distinctions.\nIn doing so, the *striking the earth* custom shall return,\nand the *tying knots* governance may be emulated.\n\nTherefore, the following passage states:\nTo govern the realm with *knowledge* (知) is to be the realm’s thief,\nbut not to govern the realm with *knowledge* is to be the realm’s *virtue* (德).\n\nCan one act as the *feminine* (雌)?\n**Imperial Commentary** says:\n*Heaven’s Gate* (天門) is where the *cosmic cycles* (歷數) emerge.\n*Opening and closing* (開闢) refers to the rise and fall of order.\nIt means that when the sovereign receives the *Mandate of Heaven* (受命),\ncan they maintain *feminine tranquility* (雌靜),\nthen they may endure and enjoy the *Heavenly Blessings* (天祿) forever.\n\nAnother interpretation says:\n*The Classic of Changes* (《易》) states:\n*\"The constant does not rely on the masculine to complete itself,\nbut guards the feminine principle—\njust as Heaven’s Gate opens and closes,\nretreating to yield more humility.\"*\n\n**Imperial Commentary** further explains:\nTo rule as a sovereign, one must cultivate *virtue* (德).\nA sovereign must uphold the *cosmic cycles* (歷數),\nfor *Heaven’s Gate* (天門) is where the *imperial succession* (帝王歷數) originates.\n*Opening* (開) signifies receiving the *Mandate of Heaven* (受命),\nwhile *closing* (闢) signifies abdication (廢黜).\nWhen Heaven bestows its *precious Mandate* (寶命),\nit grants prosperity to those with the *Way* (道).\nIf one can maintain *feminine tranquility* (雌柔),\nthey may attain the ultimate *auspiciousness* (元吉).\nThus it says: Can one act as the *feminine* (雌)?\n\nAnother interpretation says:\n*The Classic of Changes* (《易》) states:\n*\"The alternation of opening and closing is called *change* (變).*\nIt means the Sage establishes teachings\nto adapt to ever-shifting circumstances,\nnever relying on the masculine alone,\nbut guarding the *feminine principle*—\njust as Heaven’s Gate opens and closes,\nreceding to further humility and balance.\"\n\n**River Above Master** (河上公) says:\n*Heaven’s Gate* (天門) refers to the *Purple Office* (紫官) of the *Northern Pole* (北極).\n*Opening and closing* (開闢) signifies the *five cosmic junctures* (五際) of beginning and end.\nIn *governing the body* (治身),\n*Heaven’s Gate* (天門) refers to the nostrils—\n*opening* (開) is breathing in,\n*closing* (闢) is breathing out.\nTo *act as the feminine* (為雌) means\nto govern the body with *tranquility and softness* (安靜柔弱),\nand to govern the realm by harmonizing responses without excess.\n\n**Honor** says:\nHeaven has *four seasonal gates* (四時之門):\nthe *Blue Gate* (青門) opens and brings warmth,\nthe *Red Gate* (赤門) opens and brings heat,\nthe *White Gate* (白門) opens and brings cold,\nthe *Black Gate* (黑門) opens and brings chill.\nNowadays, the common people suffer oppressive summer rains and bitter cold,\nall because they cannot maintain *tranquility*.\n*Closing* (闢) means shutting—\nwhen one gate opens, the other three close.\n*Feminine* (雌) is *tranquility*.\nThe Sage’s spirit is concentrated in the *Great Void* (太漠),\ntheir wisdom is still in the *Empty Mysterious* (虚玄),\nand neither life nor death, nor calamity or fortune,\ncan disturb them.\nNor can fire, water, cold, or heat move them.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) says:\n*Closing* (闢) means shutting,\n*feminine* (雌) is *tranquility*.\nWhen Heaven and Earth *close and open* (閉闢),\nit refers to the *formation and destruction of kalpas* (劫運).\nIt means the Sage dwells harmoniously within the *Two Principles* (二儀),\nunaffected by the *Three Calamities* (三災).\nThough the kalpas may rise or fall,\nthe Sage’s heart remains ever *Empty and Tranquil* (虚靜),\nthus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Great Flood submerged Heaven yet did not drown me,\nthe Great Drought made metal and stone flow,\nearth-mountains withered and cracked,\nyet I did not feel the heat.\"*\n\n*Fourfold illumination* (明白四達) means\nthe Sage’s *virtue* (德) is clear and boundless,\nlike the radiance of the sun and moon.\n*Four* (四) signifies the four directions,\n*illumination* (照) means unobstructed,\n*illumination* (達) means without hindrance.\nIt means the Sage’s *Empty and Clear Virtue* (空惠明白)\npenetrates the *Mystic Principles* (玄理),\ntheir wisdom illuminates all things,\nand their perception reaches every domain—\nthus mentioning *four* suffices to encompass the *Eight Extremes* (八極).\nYet they remain ever still,\nand respond without contradiction,\nso their *fourfold illumination* persists.\nTheir responses never disrupt their stillness—\nthey remain in *non-action* (無為) always.\n\nAnother interpretation says:\n*Fourfold illumination* (四達) means\npenetrating the *Three Realms* (三界) and the *Dao* (道).\nTo *generate and nurture* (生之畜之)\nis to *generate without possession* (生而不有),\n*act without reliance* (為而不恃),\nand *endure without domination* (長而不宰)—\nthis is called *Mystic Virtue* (玄德).\n\n**Imperial Commentary** says:\nThe sovereign *generates and nurtures* (生之畜之),\nletting all things fulfill their natural growth and sustenance.\nThey fulfill life without claiming it as their own,\nact without relying on their deeds,\nand endure without ruling over others.\nIf a sovereign can do this,\nit is called *Mystic Virtue* (深玄之德).\n\n**Imperial Commentary** further explains:\n*Generate and nurture* (生之畜之)\nis elaborated in the lower scripture:\n*\"The Dao generates all things,\nand *virtue* (德) nurtures them.\"*\nHere, it means the sovereign upholds the *Pure Way* (清净之道),\nallowing all things to fulfill their natural essence (*生理*).\nThey embody *virtue* (德) to broadly aid and sustain,\nletting all things attain their full sustenance (*畜養*).\nThus it says: *generate and nurture* (生之畜之).\nTo *generate without possession* (生而不有),\n*act without reliance* (為而不恃),\nand *endure without domination* (長而不宰)\nis called *Mystic Virtue* (玄德).\nThings fulfill their natural growth,\nwhile the Sage forgets their own deeds.\nWhen things fulfill their growth,\ntheir natural essence is complete,\nand when deeds are forgotten,\ntheir efficacy remains constant—\nthis is *selfless yet all-encompassing*,\n*non-domination yet rule*.\nThus, *to generate without possession* (生而不有)\nmeans the sovereign lets all things fulfill their natural growth,\nyet does not claim it as their own.\n*To act without reliance* (為而不恃)\nmeans they allow all to act as they will,\nyet do not credit the deeds as their own achievements.\nAs the sovereign over all people,\nit is said they *endure* (長),\nyet do not rely on their deeds—\nthus *not to dominate* (不宰).\nSuch is called *Mystic Virtue* (深玄之德).\n\n**River Above Master** (河上公) says:\n*Generate and nurture* (生之畜之)\nrefers to the Dao generating all things and nurturing them.\nTo *generate without possession* (生而不有)\nmeans the Dao generates all things yet takes nothing for itself.\nTo *act without reliance* (為而不恃)\nmeans the Dao’s actions are not done in expectation of reward.\nTo *endure without domination* (長而不宰)\nmeans the Dao endures and nurtures all things,\ngrowing vast yet never seizing or controlling—\nit merely provides them as instruments for use.»\n\n「This is called *Mystic Virtue* (玄德), for the Dao/Way’s virtue is profound and unfathomable (玄冥), beyond direct perception, yet it seeks to guide people toward its nature.\n\n○ **Yan** (严) says:\n*Not possessing, not relying, not taking credit, not dominating* (不有不恃不以不宰),\nthe transformations are unfathomable (变化冥冥).\nThe heavens and earth regulate themselves naturally (天地自理).\n*Going without* (去为) is an analogy to illustrate the principle of teaching (譬以况理教).\nThe teaching’s words are said to be *possession* (有),\nyet the principle transcends all names and speech—*emptiness* (无).\nThe teaching’s practice is to clarify through the principle (因理而明),\nand the principle is elucidated through teaching (理之诠焉).\nBy teaching, the principle becomes manifest (由教而显),\nand the principle relies on teaching to reveal itself (理因教显).\nWithout teaching, the principle has no means of expression (无教理无所寄),\nand without the principle, teaching has no foundation (教籍理明).\nWithout the principle, what is teaching’s purpose (无理教何所说)?\n\nHaving understood the interdependence of principle and teaching (理教之相由),\none grasps how *possession* and *emptiness* serve as its essence (是体有无之为用).\n\n○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) cites *The Rites of Zhou – The Record of Craftsmen* (《周礼·考工记》):\n*\"Thirty spokes resemble the thirty days,\nto complete one month.\"* (三十辐象三十日，以成一月也)\n\nWhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe hub’s interior is hollow (箱毂内空),\nyet this very hollowness allows it to contain things—\nthus the wheel’s utility (只为空能容物，故有车用).\nConsider the scholar’s mind as emptiness (況学人心空),\nso it can bear the weight of all sentient beings (故能运载苍生也).\nMoreover, the wheel is but a *conventional name* (假名),\narising from the harmonious convergence of all conditions (诸缘和合而成).\nAnalyzing its nature thoroughly,\none finds its entirety is void and illusory (此车细析推寻，遍体虚幻).\nHow much more so for all dharmas (诸法),\nwhich are likewise in their entirety.\n\n*Molding clay to make vessels* (埏埴以为器),\nwhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe vessel’s utility is realized (有器之用).\n**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):\n*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和).\n*坛* (Tamped earth) refers to *clay* (土).\nThe potter harmonizes the clay,\nforging it into jars and pots (陶匠和土，为瓦缶之器也).\n\n**Yu’s Commentary** (御疏):\n*埏埴* (Molding clay) refers to *adhesive clay* (粘土).\nThe annotation says *potter* (陶匠),\nyet *The Book of Documents* (《尚书》) states:\n*\"To knead the earth is called pottery.\"* (范土曰陶)\nHere, the potter kneads and molds the clay,\nfires it into ceramic vessels,\nand takes advantage of their emptiness\nto hold and receive things (烧以成器，器中空虚，以用盛受物也).\n\n○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:\n*Molding clay to make vessels* (埏埴以为器),\n*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和),\n*坛* (Tamped earth) refers to *clay* (土).\nThe potter harmonizes the clay\nto create vessels for food and drink (和土以为食饮之器也).\nWhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe vessel’s utility is realized—\nits hollowness allows it to contain and receive (器中空虚，故得有所盛受也).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nTo *make vessels*, one must first harmonize the clay (作器必须和泥),\nand only when the clay is refined does the vessel serve its purpose (泥调则器可用).\nTo *cultivate the self*, one must purify conduct (修身理宜炼行),\nand only when conduct is pure does the Dao/Way manifest (行洁则道可成).\n*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和),\n*埴* (Clay) refers to *earth* (土).\n\n○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) again cites *The Record of Craftsmen* (《考工记》):\n*\"埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和).\n*値* (Clay) refers to *adhesive clay* (粘土).\nHarmonizing adhesive clay with water and earth,\nfiring it to form vessels—\nthough the vessel’s interior is empty,\nit is capable of containing and receiving (和粘水土，烧以成器，器中空无，故得盛受).\nThis illustrates how the scholar’s mind, being emptiness,\ncan embrace all things (況学人心空，故能容物).\n\n*Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling* (凿户牖以为室),\nwhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe dwelling’s utility is realized (有室之用).\n**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):\nIn ancient times, people dug caves to dwell in (古者陶穴以为室宇),\nand even these were furnished with doors and windows (亦开户牖),\nhence the term *carving* (故云凿耳).\n\n**Yu’s Commentary** (御疏):\n*凿* (Carving) means *piercing* or *hollowing* (穿).\n*牖* (Windows) refers to openings beside doors (门旁窗).\nIn ancient times, people lived in caves (穴居),\nso *The Book of Odes* (《诗》) says:\n*\"To dig and cover the cave\"* (陶复陶穴),\nmeaning they hollowed out the earth within the cave\nand covered it above—\nhence the term *carving* (穿凿穴中之土以复覆其上，故云凿耳).\nLater sages replaced this with official dwellings (官室),\nyet the principle remains:\nthe dwelling’s emptiness allows people to reside (取其室中空虚，所以人得居处).\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"If a dwelling has no emptiness,\neven wives and mothers-in-law will jostle for passage\"* (室无空虚，则妇姑勃蹊),\nmeaning they will *contend for the path* (勃蹊谓争路也).\n*The Er Ya* (《尔雅》) states:\n*\"Official halls are called dwellings\"* (官谓之室).\nThus, *possession* (有) is for *advantage* (利),\nwhile *emptiness* (无) is for *utility* (用).\nThe advantage of *possession* (有体利无)\nis that it relies on *emptiness* (以无为利),\nyet the advantage of *emptiness* (利铃资无)\nis that it depends on *possession*—\nhence *emptiness* is advantageous through *possession* (故有以无为利也).\nThe utility of *emptiness* (无之所用)\nis rooted in its form (用於体),\nyet its form requires *possession*—\nhence *emptiness* derives utility from *possession* (体必资有，故无以有为用也).\nThe annotation says:\n*\"That which transcends form is called Dao/Way* (形而上者曰道),\n*that which is beneath form is called vessel* (形而下者曰器),\nas written in *The Systematic Words of the Yi* (《易·系辞》).\nWhen it is purely *emptiness*, it is called Dao/Way (自无则称道),\nand when it involves *possession*, it is called vessel (涉有则称器).\nTo clarify the Dao/Way’s utility,\none must use form and vessel as analogies (欲明道用，必约形器以彰).\nThough these analogies employ the three illustrations,\nthe ultimate aim remains to emphasize *emptiness* in all governance (终用无於一政耳).\n\n○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:\n*Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling* (凿户牖以为室)\nrefers to constructing houses (谓作室屋).\nWhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe dwelling’s utility is realized—\ndoors and windows are hollow,\nallowing people to enter and exit (户牖室虚，人得以出入).\nObserving the dwelling’s emptiness,\npeople can reside within—\nthis is its utility (观视室中空虚，人得居处，是其用也).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nIf a dwelling is not hollow within,\nand lacks doors and windows without,\nits utility is not difficult to grasp (其为用不以难乎).\nYet the Dao/Way is inwardly obscure and dark (内既暗昧),\nexternally deaf and blind (外复聋瞽),\nand seeking it thus is no easy matter (以此求道，理非易乎).\nA dwelling with doors and windows is useful (室开户牖，有用也).\nSo too, when a person’s wisdom is enlightened,\nthe Dao/Way is accomplished (人生慧解，道成之).\n\n○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):\nTo pierce and hollow doors and windows,\nto construct houses—\nthough the interior is empty,\nit allows people to reside (穿凿户牖，以为屋室，室中空无，故得居处).\nConsider the scholar’s mind as emptiness,\nso it can embrace all things (況学人心空，故能覆物).\nMoreover, piercing and hollowing doors and windows\nallows passage for people,\nyet emptiness in the roots and orifices\npermits use without attachment (況根窍虚通，故能用而无染).\nThe three analogies—wheel, vessel, and dwelling—\nshare similar meaning,\nyet they are repeated for emphasis:\nthe wheel is for motion but not stillness (车则动而不静),\nthe dwelling is for stillness but not motion (室则静而不动),\nthe vessel is both motion and stillness (器则亦动亦静).\nThese three distinctions\nare why they are restated (有此三异，故重出之).\nThe second purpose is to distinguish *possession* and *emptiness*,\nand to clarify their interdependence (显明资导).\nThus, *possession* is for *advantage*,\nand *emptiness* is for *utility* (故有之以为利，无之以为用).\n\n**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):\n*Possession* relies on *emptiness* for advantage (有体利无),\nand *emptiness* is advantageous through *possession* (以无为利).\n*Emptiness* derives utility from *possession* (无用体者),\nand *possession* is the means of *emptiness’* utility (以有为用).\nMoreover, that which transcends form is called Dao/Way (形而上者曰道),\nand that which is beneath form is called vessel (形而下者曰器).\nTo elucidate the supreme Dao/Way’s utility,\none must use form and substance as analogies (将明至道之用，约形质以彰).\nThus, one borrows the coarse advantage of *possession* over *emptiness*\nto clarify the subtle utility of *emptiness* in *possession* (故借粗有之利无，以明妙无之用有耳).\n\n○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:\nThus, *possession* is for *advantage* (故有之以为利),\nfor things benefit from their form (物利於形),\nand vessels contain things while dwellings shelter people—\nyet one fears the house may collapse (器中有物，室中有人，恐其屋破坏).\nThe stomach contains the spirit (腹中有神),\nyet one fears the body’s decay (畏其形之消亡也).\n*Emptiness* is for *utility* (无之以为用),\nfor only within the void can one contain and receive (虚空中者，乃可用盛受物),\nhence it is said: *\"The void governs the form of possession\"* (故曰虚无制有形).\nThe Dao/Way is emptiness itself (道者空无也).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nIf there is only *possession* and no *emptiness*,\n*possession* alone cannot be advantageous (有不得为利).\nIf there is only *emptiness* and no *possession*,\n*emptiness* alone cannot serve its purpose (无不得为用).\nThis makes clear that *possession* depends on *emptiness* for advantage (明有因无以为利),\nand *emptiness* depends on *possession* for utility (无因有以为用).\nHaving recognized how *possession* and *emptiness* interdependently arise (既识有无之相因),\none naturally understands the coarse and subtle as mutually reliant (自知粗妙之相籍也).」\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Possession* relies on *emptiness* for advantage,\n*emptiness* depends on *possession* for utility—\nthese two principles mutually support each other,\nthus forming the Dao/Way of vehicles and such.\n\nIt is said that the student must use *possession* to nourish *emptiness*,\nand *emptiness* to guide *possession*—\nwhen *possession* and *emptiness* mutually nourish and guide,\nthe mind does not become one-sided or immersed,\nthus achieving the student’s utility.\n\n**Chapter XII: The Five Colors Blind the Eyes**\n\nThe discussion of the five colors follows the preceding chapter,\nfor the earlier chapter broadly cited vehicles and instruments\nto demonstrate that dependent principles are not inherent.\nThus, this chapter directly examines colors and sounds\nto clarify the true *dharma* and the opposition of emptiness and illusion,\nhence its placement here.\n\nWithin this chapter, three teachings unfold:\n1. **The dust defiles the faculties—one must cultivate aversion.**\n2. **The faculties are stained by dusty realms—one must be urged to stillness.**\n3. **The distinction between sages and commoners—demonstrating their choices.**\n\n**1. The dust defiles the faculties—one must cultivate aversion.**\n\nThe supreme Dao/Way is tranquil and forgetful,\nits nature and essence both quiescent.\nFrom a single breath of *qi*, humanity is formed.\nThe rounded head upholds Heaven,\nthe square feet tread Earth.\nThe four limbs mirror the four seasons,\nthe five viscera follow the five phases—\nthus the eyes and ears attain clarity,\nthe mind and emotions become luminous.\n\nOne must veil the artificial hues of *possession*,\nreturning to the pristine source of truth.\nHow could the restless, roving heart\nbind itself to the deeds of blindness and deafness,\nunable to sever deceit and illusion,\npursuing the Great Dao/Way?\nIt rides the vermilion phoenix to the Red Terrace,\ncommands the dark rainbow in the Azure Abyss—\nabandoning that to take this,\neternally becoming a True Person.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five sounds deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\nThe eyes delight in the sights of blue, yellow, red, white, and black;\nthe ears indulge in the melodies of *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—\nthus the form and body become blind and deaf.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nColors refer to blue, yellow, red, white, and black;\nsounds refer to *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*;\nflavors refer to sour, bitter, spicy, sweet, and salty.\n*\"Dull\"* means \"erroneous.\"\nThe eyes see colors, the ears hear sounds, the mouth tastes flavors—\nif indulged to excess, harm inevitably follows.\nThus, one’s form and body become blind, deaf, and dulled.\n\nMoreover, if one is infatuated with the transient laws of the world,\nunaware that colors and sounds are empty in nature,\nhow could it be only the form and body that are blind and deaf?\nThis is also the blindness and deafness of wisdom.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe five colors blind the eyes—\ngreed and lust for colors drain the essence, causing blindness.\nThe five sounds deafen the ears—\nindulgence in the five tones disperses the harmonious *qi* of the heart,\nrendering one unable to hear the soundless sound.\nThe five flavors dull the palate—\ndeceitful craving for the five flavors makes the mouth dull,\nspeaking of deviation from the Dao/Way.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nThose who indulge in the five colors’ sights\nsee neither the forms of blessings nor calamities—\ncolors are the spear that pierces the eyes.\nThose who abandon themselves to the variations of the five sounds\ncannot hear the voices of auspiciousness or misfortune—\nthey are the mallet that seals the ears.\nThose who delight in the five flavors’ changes\ncannot discern the true emotions of right and wrong—\nthey are the instrument that severs the tongue.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThough the eyes can see, if one is infatuated with colors without restraint,\nthey lose their clarity.\nThough the ears can hear, if one indulges in sounds without fatigue,\nthey lose their acuity.\nThough the mouth can taste, if one exhausts itself in flavors without end,\nit perverts its nourishment—\nthus, it becomes dulled.\nYet \"blindness\" is defined by not seeing,\n\"deafness\" by not hearing.\nTo have eyes yet not see the True Person and Great Sage—this is blindness.\nTo have ears yet not hear the vast music of the subtle\nor the subtle, wondrous spiritual sounds—this is deafness.\nThe mouth’s purpose is to discern flavors,\nbut if one craves mundane tastes and loses the flavor of the Dao/Way,\nthus it is said to be dulled.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe five colors blind the eyes—\nthe five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black.\nIf one cannot internally illuminate the true source\nbut instead chases external dusty realms,\nthough they see the colors of empty space,\nthey say it is not blindness—\nwhat difference is there between not seeing and blindness?\n\nThe five sounds deafen the ears—\nthe five sounds are *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*.\nIf the heart is entangled in strings and bamboo,\nthe ears are clogged by *gong* and *shang*,\nunable to return and hear the subtle sounds—\nthus, it is called deafness.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\nNot only does the form and body have blindness and deafness—\nwisdom also has them.\n\nThe five flavors dull the palate—\nthe five flavors are sweet, bitter, spicy, sour, and salty.\n*\"Dull\"* means \"erroneous.\"\nIf one indulges in wine and strong drinks,\nchews on rancid and gamey meats,\nunable to savor the Dao/Way or discuss the mysterious,\nthus it is said the mouth is dulled.\n\n**2. The faculties are stained by dusty realms—one must be urged to stillness.**\n\nGalloping and hunting drive the mind to madness.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\nGalloping and hunting are worldly pursuits—\nlike hunting, one is obsessed with killing and capturing.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\nDaily, the heart wages battle,\nchasing realms and galloping—\nif one reflects in stillness, it is the disease of madness.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThis speaks of those entangled in sounds and colors,\ntheir desires galloping like hunters—\nonly seeking to kill and capture,\ntheir desires raging, chasing realms like a gallop.\nIf one observes them in stillness, it is the disease of madness.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nHuman spirit naturally seeks tranquility,\nbut galloping and panting disperse the spirit,\nthus madness arises.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nThose who delight in the variations of hunting\ncannot escape confusion and delusion—\nhunting is the teacher of madness.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nTo indulge in fishing and hunting is to lose the business of Great Peace,\nto hunt for fame and reputation is to incur the illness of Zhang Yi.\nThe loss of life and state—this is the greatest madness.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n\"Galloping\" means \"racing.\"\nThose who hunt are greedy for beasts,\ntheir hearts delighted and unrestrained—\nlike madmen.\nThose who invert principles, their desires chasing realms,\nmove swiftly like galloping,\nmad as hunters.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\nThere are five ways to lose one’s nature—\nthe first is that the five colors confuse the eyes,\ncausing them to lose their clarity, and so on.\n\nHard-to-obtain treasures obstruct one’s path.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\nThese are things beyond one’s natural endowment—\nthough sought, they cannot be obtained.\nFoolishly pursuing what is unattainable\nthus obstructs the path of the Dao/Way.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n\"Hard-to-obtain treasures\" refers to those who\nregard vulgar possessions as treasures.\nWhat is hard to obtain is what lies beyond one’s natural endowment—\nthough sought, it cannot be attained.\n\n---\n\nThose who fail to abide in their natural endowment,\ntwisting their nature to seek recklessly—\nonce they stray beyond Heaven’s decree,\nthis obstructs the practice of the Dao/Way.\n\n**River Master’s Commentary:**\n*\"Obstruct\"* means *\"harm.\"*\n\n\"Hard-to-obtain treasures\" refers to gold, silver, pearls, and jade.\nWhen the heart is covetous and desires know no bound,\none’s practice is injured and brings shame to the body.\n\n**Yan’s Commentary:**\nGreed for wealth’s manifold forms\ninevitably leads to corrupt inclinations.\n\nWealth is the ruin of one’s foundation.\n\n**Li Rong’s Commentary:**\nBeautiful women and precious gems—\nthese are the hard-to-obtain treasures.\nThey disrupt the heart and harm one’s practice.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Citation:**\n\"Hard-to-obtain treasures\" refers to the *Zhao Bi* jade and *Sui Zhu* pearl—\nrare and splendid treasures.\nTo cling and indulge in them\nis the root of birth-and-death,\ngreatly hindering Daoist cultivation.\n\nThus, the Sage distinguishes between the belly and the eyes:\nhe acts for the belly, not for the eyes.\nHence, he discards the one and embraces the other.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThe belly receives without discrimination;\nthe eyes are ensnared by the dust of colors.\nWithout discrimination, harmony is complete—\nthus, he acts for the belly.\nTo be ensnared by colors harms one’s nature—\nthus, he does not act for the eyes.\nHence, he discards the eyes’ deluded gaze\nand embraces the belly’s nurturing of nature.\n\n**River Master’s Commentary:**\nTherefore, the Sage acts for the belly,\npreserving the Five Natures,\ndiscarding the Six Emotions,\nmoderating will and breath,\nnourishing spirit and clarity.\nHe does not act for the eyes,\nlest they gaze in vain and dissipate vital essence outward.\nThus, he discards the eyes’ deluded gaze\nand embraces the belly’s cultivation of nature.\n\n**Yan’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage wears the color of no-color,\nlistens to the sound of no-sound,\ntastes the flavor of no-flavor,\nrides the boundless realm,\ntraverses the limitless expanse,\ncasts the formless net,\nand attains the heart of Dao/virtue.\n\n**Li Rong’s Commentary:**\nThe empty heart is inwardly full—\nthis is the belly.\nTo return hearing without blindness—\nthis is not the eyes.\nTo abandon burdensome deeds,\nto welcome the Way of Non-Action.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Citation:**\nThus, the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes—\nthis continues from the earlier distinction between the Sage and the common man.\nThe belly is the inner self; the eyes, the outer.\nEmbracing Dao/virtue and power within,\nfilling the inner—this is the belly.\nTo perceive no colors inwardly, to return hearing to no-sounds,\nall senses purified, unstained by dust—\nthis is not the eyes.\nHence, he discards the blindness and deafness of the eyes\nand embraces the belly’s true wisdom.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Chapter on Honor and Humiliation as Cause for Alarm**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior chapter examined the false nature of root-and-dust teachings.\nThus, this chapter clarifies that returning to the body is itself a calamity.\n\nWithin this chapter, there are three distinctions:\nFirst, it broadly states that honor and humiliation are equally perilous;\nSecond, it poses hypothetical questions to explain why;\nThird, it weighs the value of wealth to reveal its gains and losses.\n\n**First Distinction: Honor and Humiliation Are Equally Perilous**\n\nTo surpass the sovereign in honor is to exceed the Nine Ranks,\nwhile the path of death lies in the Thirteen Offenses.\nThus, the two paths of honor and humiliation are opened,\nrevealing the delusion of all sentient beings.\n\nA household’s splendor—\nthe mighty bearing great caps and long swords,\nthe grandeur of rank and office—\nthose who wear swords and trailing ribbons—\nhow could they know that a single merit of obscurity\nbrings ruin to noble kin?\nThus, Huo Guang’s anxiety from thorny suspicions,\nYang Dan’s downfall from a single bean’s worth of error.\n\nThe Master of Lao warns: *\"Honor and humiliation must be met with alarm.\"*\nReflect, O common man—\nyour heart cannot discern:\nentering the court without reward,\nexiting in honor yet ever at ease—\nthis is why the minister’s favor turns to enmity,\nfor it is the key to the executioner’s blade.\n\n**Honor and humiliation must be met with alarm.**\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nTo hold honor brings trembling;\nto lose it brings sorrow.\nAs long as one does not forget honor and humiliation,\nboth inspire alarm.\n\n**Imperial Citation:**\n*\"If\"* means *\"as.\"*\nIt states that the alarm of honor and humiliation is equal.\n\nWhen one holds honor, it is honor;\nwhen one loses it, it is humiliation.\nIt means that people cannot equalize their hearts to honor and humiliation—\nthey boast in their achievements, cling to power,\nand when in office, they revel in glory,\nbut when fallen, they suffer the shame of disgrace.\nThus, the warning is given to make them tremble,\nurging them to equalize their response to honor and humiliation.\n\n**River Master’s Commentary:**\nTo be honored is alarming;\nto be humiliated is alarming.\n\n**Li Rong’s Commentary:**\nHigh office brings fear of danger;\nlow station brings shame—\nboth are fears.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Citation:**\n*\"Honor\"* is the name for delight and love;\n*\"humiliation\"* is the term for disgrace and shame.\n*\"If\"* means *\"as\";*\n*\"alarm\"* means *\"fear.\"*\nWhen one gains honor, one is carefree and joyous;\nwhen one suffers humiliation, one is fearful and anxious.\nThus, gaining honor fills the heart with joyful alarm,\nsuffering humiliation fills the heart with fearful alarm.\nThough joy and fear differ,\nboth are forms of alarm—\nhence, *\"as.\"*\n\nYet these emotions of joy and fear\nare not the true nature.\nThus, the enlightened compare prosperity and adversity to cold and heat,\nequate honor and humiliation to transient occurrences—\nunshaken by life and death,\nhow could noble and base status alarm them?\n\n**Wealth is a great peril to the body.**\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThe body is the foundation of breath—\nthus, one treasures the body as one treasures great breath.\nThe phrase *\"wealth is a great peril to the body\"* is combined with *\"to treasure the body as great breath,\"*\nyet it states *\"to treasure great breath as the body\"*—\nthis is to clarify that when the mind arises to blame the body,\nit is itself the great breath.\nIf there is wealth, then the body is the great breath;\nthus, *\"to treasure great breath as the body.\"*\n\n*\"If\"* means *\"as.\"* The two preceding sentences are the main point.\n\n「○ **Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"Noble\"* means to hold in high regard.\n*\"If\"* means *\"as.\"*\n\nThe body is the source of the great peril of breath.\nThose who indulge in sounds and colors,\nwho vie for honor and wealth—\nall do so because of the body,\nthus making the body the root of affliction.\n\nIf one truly treasures the body,\nwhat else could be more precious?\nYet it is the source of great peril.\nFor the body is breath itself—\nno distinction exists between them.\nIf one cannot be free from peril,\nit is because of the body.\nThus, to treasure the body is the same as treasuring great peril.\nIf one could abandon breath,\none would also forget the body.\nThis shows that peril arises from what is held noble,\nand the body is the root of affliction—\nhence, *\"wealth is a great peril to the body.\"*\n\n○ **Master He Shang** said:\nOne returns to question oneself,\nthus fearing the great breath reaching the body.\n\n○ **Master Rong** said:\nThose who disregard the body find gain and loss hard to alarm,\nbut those who treasure the body are easily startled by honor and humiliation.\nIf one treasures the body,\nthen great peril arises—\nthus, it is said, *\"wealth is a great peril to the body.\"*\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Noble\"* refers to rank and status,\nwhich is also to hold oneself in high regard.\n*\"Great peril\"* refers to afflictions—\nold age, sickness, and so forth.\nCommon people know only to prize this body\nand despise the great breath,\nyet they fail to see that the great breath *is* the body.\nBy seeking resources and sustenance,\nthey inevitably lead to decay and ruin.\nThus, to treasure the body is to treasure peril,\nand to reject peril is to reject the body—\nfor both nobility and great peril\ntake the body as their foundation.\nHence, *\"as.\"*\n\nThis is a second hypothetical question,\nclarifying the reasoning behind it.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"honor and humiliation\"*?\n*\"Honor\"* is the lesser.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThe passage earlier equates honor and humiliation to alarm,\nlest people fail to understand,\nso it asks: What is meant by *\"honor and humiliation\"*?\nIt answers itself: *\"Honor\"* is the lesser.\nThis clarifies that honor is the lesser because\nthose who rely on honor become arrogant and inflated,\nand arrogance inevitably brings misfortune.\nSince misfortune arises from honor,\nhonor is the root of humiliation—\nthus, *\"honor\"* is the lesser.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nThe passage earlier equates honor and humiliation to alarm,\nlest people fail to comprehend,\nso it poses the question: What is meant by *\"honor and humiliation\"*?\nIt answers itself: *\"Honor\"* is the lesser.\nThe reason honor is lesser is this:\nthose who depend on honor become arrogant and inflated,\nand arrogance breeds disaster.\nMisfortune follows from honor,\nso honor is the root of humiliation—\nthus, *\"honor\"* is the lesser.\n\n○ **Master He Shang** said:\nWhat is meant by *\"honor and humiliation\"*?\nIt asks: What is *\"honor\"*? What is *\"humiliation\"*?\n*\"Honor\"* is the love of glory,\n*\"humiliation\"* is shame upon the body.\nOne returns to question oneself\nto enlighten others.\n*\"Honor\"* is lowly,\n*\"humiliation\"* is lowly and base.\n\n○ **Master Rong** said:\nWhat is meant by *\"honor and humiliation\"*?\nIt raises the question, answering that *\"honor\"* is lowly.\n*\"Honor\"* should be called high,\n*\"humiliation\"* should be called low,\nyet here it states *\"honor\"* is low—\nthis implies that if one understands *\"honor\"* as low,\nthen *\"humiliation\"* as high is naturally clear.\nIt does not elaborate fully but briefly states:\nIn the world, people love glory and wealth,\ntreating honor as high—\nyet high status brings near danger,\nand glory brings humiliation.\nThus, *\"honor\"* is low.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nWhat is meant by *\"honor and humiliation\"*?\nThis is a hypothetical question.\n*\"Honor\"* is lowly—\nto gain it is alarming,\nto lose it is alarming—\nthis explains its meaning.\nHuman nature is inverted:\nthey consider honor high,\nbut with enlightened insight, it is truly base.\nWhy?\nBecause gaining honor fills one with joyful alarm,\nlosing it fills one with fearful alarm.\nThese two alarms\noriginate from the same *\"honor,\"*\nso it is called low.\n\nTo gain it is alarming,\nto lose it is alarming—\nthis is what is meant by *\"honor and humiliation as alarm.\"*\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nHonor is gained, humiliation is lost—\n*\"as alarm\"* means that honor and humiliation cycle endlessly,\nso honor is the root of humiliation.\nBetween lifetimes, beings\nrejoice at honor and fear humiliation,\nso the Sage warns:\n*\"When you gain honor, regard it as if you had gained humiliation and were alarmed,\nthen when you lose honor and gain humiliation,\nyou will also follow my warning—\nbe alarmed as if you had gained honor.\"*\nThus, the scripture says: *\"This is what is meant by honor and humiliation as alarm.\"*\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nWhen one gains, it is honor;\nwhen one loses, it is humiliation—\n*\"as alarm\"* means that honor and humiliation cycle endlessly,\nso honor is the root of humiliation.\nBetween lifetimes, beings\nrejoice at honor and fear humiliation,\nso the Sage warns:\n*\"Like ink spilled in disorder,\nhonor and humiliation are unstable—\nwhy alarm at only one?\"*\nWhen humiliation comes, one is alarmed by its perilous breath;\nwhen honor arrives, one is alarmed by arrogance and ease.\nThe alarms are equal,\nthus the scripture says: *\"This is what is meant by honor and humiliation as alarm.\"*\n\n○ **Master He Shang** said:\nTo gain it is alarming—\n*\"gain\"* means honor and glory,\n*\"alarming\"* means standing in high position as if in danger,\nnoble yet not daring to be arrogant,\nrich yet not daring to be extravagant.\nTo lose it is alarming—\n*\"lose\"* means losing honor and facing humiliation,\n*\"alarming\"* means fearing renewed misfortune.\nThis is what is meant by *\"honor and humiliation as alarm,\"*\nexplaining the earlier *\"to gain it is alarming, to lose it is alarming.\"*\n\n○ **Master Rong** said:\nHonor brings glory,\nhumiliation brings aid.\nWhether gained or lost,\nboth fill one with alarm—\nonly those of empty tranquility\nare unshaken in their thoughts.\nThis is what is meant by *\"honor and humiliation as alarm,\"*\nconcluding the preceding meaning.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"This is what is meant by honor and humiliation as alarm,\"*\nconcluding the meaning of humiliation and honor.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"wealth is a great peril to the body\"*?\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nLest people fail to grasp that the body is the root of breath,\nit asks this.\n\n○ **Master He Shang** said:\nOne returns to question oneself,\nthus fearing the great breath reaching the body.\n\n○ **Master Rong** said:\nA question is posed.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nA hypothetical question.\nWhy do I have great peril?\nBecause I have a body.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThe body’s form is empty and illusory,\nyet it is the root of affliction\nbecause I cling to having a body—\npain, itching, cold, and heat—\nthus, it is the source of bodily affliction.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nWhy do I have this great peril?\nBecause I cling to the body’s form,\nlove glory, hate humiliation,\ndistinguish right and wrong,\nand when I do not obtain what I desire,\nI am filled with great anxiety and fear.\nMy mind and spirit are internally exhausted by craving,\nmy form is externally strained by competition—\nlaboring and enslaved, what else could it be but affliction?\n\n○ **Master He Shang** said:\nWhy do I have great peril?\nBecause I have a body—\nthen I fear movement and toil,\nponder hunger and cold,\nfollow emotions and desires,\nand thus encounter the great peril of breath and the dissolution of glory.\n\nThe body is burdened with the diseases of flourishing and decay,\nand the calamity of life and death—\nthus, it is called *\"great peril.\"*»\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThis responds to the prior question.\nClinging to my body, unable to forget or release it,\nmakes bodily suffering the root of great affliction—\nthus one knows that valuing the body is no different from suffering.\nHence the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"The body is the source of vexation;\npain, itch, cold, and heat—\nI am bound by the body,\nand thus know it as great affliction.\"*\n\nWhen I have no body, what affliction could I have?\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nHe who knows that heaven and earth are in harmonious accord,\nand none of it belongs to me—\nabandoning form, discarding wisdom,\nrealizing the body is not the body,\nuniting with the Dao—\nwhat affliction could there be?\n\n**Imperial Commentary (expanded):**\n*\"No body\"* means one who comprehends the body’s form as empty and illusory,\nitself not real—\nthen one must sit in *zuowang* (sitting-forgetting), abandoning perception,\ncollapsing the body, discarding hearing,\nmerging with the boundless Dao’s non-attachment,\naligning with heaven and earth’s non-possession—\nnaturally, the paths of honor and disgrace vanish,\nand the hearts of love and hatred cease.\nThis is what is meant by *\"the Emperor’s suspended resolution\"*—\nwhat further bondage to great affliction could there be?\nThus it is said: *When I have no body, what affliction could I have?*\nThe note on *\"commit and accord\"* comes from Zhuangzi’s response to Shun:\n*\"The body is not yours—it is heaven and earth’s committed accord.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\nIf I have no body, and attain the Dao naturally,\nlightly ascending to the clouds,\nentering and exiting without obstruction,\ncommuning with the Dao—\nwhat affliction could there be?\n\n**Master Yan** said:\nRest the mind in Dao and virtue,\nrecord the will in spirit and clarity—\nharmony is the central master,\nserene as if unborn,\na plan beyond planning,\ncrafting heaven and earth,\na concern beyond concern,\nsoaring in the boundless dark,\npreserving and forgetting in transformation—\nnot distinguishing these as strange.\nHonor and disgrace, high and low—\nno excess, no deficiency.\nValuing the great, it perishes in the body—\nthus great affliction cannot take hold,\nnor can the heavenly net ensnare.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nEmptying oneself, forgetting the heart—\nthis is having no body.\nThe afflictions of right and wrong arise from the body;\nif the body is forgotten,\nthen death and life cannot burden,\nhonor and disgrace cannot disturb—\nwhat affliction could there be?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nIt is only because of *having* that the body becomes affliction;\nif the body is already nonexistent,\nwhere could affliction lodge?\nThus, *I have no body, where would affliction attach?*\nThe *\"nonexistent\"* refers to *zuowang*, losing the self,\ncollapsing the body, abandoning form—\nthis is the body having no body.\n*\"Nonexistent\"* is not annihilation, but simply *nonexistent*.\n\nThe third comparison reveals gain and loss in valuation.\nThus, *valuing the body as the world*\nis like being able to entrust the world to it.\n*Loving the body as the world*\nis like being able to commit the world to it.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThis chapter first warns against honor and disgrace,\nthen concludes with entrustment—\nif one is startled by honor and disgrace,\nit means one has not forgotten honor and disgrace,\nhas not forgotten valuation and love.\nThus, comparing disgrace to honor,\ndisgrace is not as grave as honor;\ncomparing love to valuation,\nvaluation is not as deep as love.\nThose startled by honor and disgrace\nstill harbor concern for honor and disgrace,\nand those who retain valuation and love\nhave not yet forgotten the world entirely.\nThus, first it makes one startled by honor and disgrace,\nthen it seeks to make one forget both honor and disgrace—\nusing the name of entrustment\nto distinguish the extreme of forgetting,\nforgetting honor and disgrace,\nhaving nothing left to startle,\nforgetting the body means no root of affliction,\nforgetting the world means no pretension of entrustment.\nOnly then does one have the *Supreme Sovereign* above\nand the *Submissive Minister* below—\ndoing nothing yet achieving all,\nhaving no virtue yet possessing virtue.\n\n**Imperial Commentary (expanded):**\nThe ruler who prizes his body as the world’s master,\ndeeming himself above others,\nrisks being temporarily entrusted with the world,\nbut not enduring.\nIf the ruler loves his body as the world’s master,\nnot for himself but for the people—\nas their parent—\nthen his virtue can entrust his body to the people,\nruling forever without answer.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nThe Supreme Sovereign values virtue, not the body;\nthe enlightened king loves the people, not himself.\nIf one can do this,\nthen one can endure.\nIf one values the body and belittles others,\nloves oneself while hating others,\none cannot align with heaven and earth’s benevolence,\nequal the sun and moon’s illumination—\nthen it is only a temporary entrustment.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThus, *valuing the body as the world*\nis like being able to entrust the world to it—\nyet one does not know the body is great affliction,\nproudly valuing it,\nalways seeking to dominate others.\nSuch a person may temporarily reside in the world,\nbut cannot long govern it.\n*Loving the body as the world*\nis like being able to commit the world to it—\n*\"entrust\"* means temporary lodging,\n*\"commit\"* means enduring attachment.\nIf one preserves himself with humility,\nsubmissively yielding to others,\nthen he can transform the world—\nhence the *Classic of Virtue* says: *\"Love yourself, but do not exalt yourself.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter 14: The Chapter on \"Seeing It Unseen\"**\nThis chapter follows the previous one\nbecause the prior chapter directly posits the body as great affliction,\nwarning against indulgence.\nThis chapter reveals the subtle, mysterious body,\nencouraging cultivation—\nfirst diagnosing the illness, then prescribing the remedy—\nhence its placement.\n\n**Chapter 14: The Chapter on \"Seeing It Unseen\"**\n\nThis chapter’s meaning is divided into six parts.\n1. It clarifies that *non-duality is unity*—\n   how the singular is dispersed into the three.\n2. It clarifies that *non-triplicity is triplicity*—\n   how the three are merged into the singular.\n3. It reveals that the **Dao/Way** is neither foolish nor wise**,\n   transcending all named speech.\n4. It shows that the subtle body** manifests myriad colors and sounds,\n   yet responds to nothing in fixed form.\n5. It demonstrates that it is *neither non-existence nor existence*,\n   neither ancient nor modern.\n6. It reveals that it is *both ancient and modern*,\n   the guiding principle and the fundamental thread.\n\nThe first part clarifies that *non-duality is unity*—\n   how the singular is dispersed into the three.\n\nThe profound **Dao/Way** is deep and hidden,\nits vast source unfathomable.\nIt spans the three heavens** yet is rarely seen,\nascends the eight realms** yet is hard to find.\nLike a chicken egg before its divisions,\none looks up to the **Dragon** yet cannot perceive it.\nFaint and obscure, dark and silent,\nits essence eludes all grasping—\nthus the Yellow Emperor lost it at Kunqiu**,\nand Emperor Yao sought it in Gushan**,\nneither born nor extinguished,\ntranscending the ten thousand ages yet enduring,\nwithout color or form,\npiercing the Three Pure Ones** and emerging first.\n\nFrom its origin descending to its traces,\nit unfolds countless wondrous paths.\nThe heavens and earth **qi** swirl in harmony,\nopening the **Hall of Creation** to extend its domain.\nIt displays the **True Scripture** in the **Jade Box**,\nencompassing all beings within the **Treasure Pearl**.\nThus, Liu An summoned the Eight Immortals**,\nthe Queen Mother gained the service of the Twin Boys**,\nMadame Ma paused in conversation,\npointing to the three shifts of the sea’s waters,\nand Ding Ling sang his farewell,\nknowing his homeland had changed once.\nThe wondrous applications of the **Dao/Way** are vast indeed!\n\nThe term **\"Seeing It Unseen\"** is called *Yi* (夷).\n*Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\nThis is the **Dao/Way** revealed.\n\n「夷」 is called *Yi*—smooth and simple. The **Dao/Way** is not a color, so it cannot be seen. Yet within the realm of no-color, it can manifest all colors; thus, it is named *Yi*.\n\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\nThis passage elucidates the **Dao/Way**. Those who seek to see it do so through color, those who seek to hear it do so through sound, and those who seek to grasp it do so through form. But the **Dao/Way** is neither color, sound, nor form—thus, all such seeking fails.\n\nBecause it cannot be obtained through such means, one might say it is \"nonexistent.\" Yet within no-color, it manifests all colors; within no-sound, it harmonizes all sounds; within no-form, it assumes all forms. Thus, it possesses *Yi*—color without color, *Xi*—sound without sound, and *Wei*—form without form. Therefore, it is called *Yi Xi Wei*.\n\n*Yi Xi Wei* refers to what is called \"illuminating the **Dao/Way** but not the **Dao/Way** itself.\" *Yi* is smooth and simple. *Xi* is the subtle and profound nature of sound. *Wei* is the grasp of form.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\n*\"Yi\"* means no-color—one without hues, unseen yet perceived. It cannot be grasped through sight alone.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\nIs the **Dao/Way** distant? The eyes cannot see it. Yet the sage comprehends it, perceiving its clarity alone, and thus names it *Yi*. *Yi* is plainness; the Great **Dao/Way** is utterly simple, naturally good and effortlessly wise.\n\n○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:\n*\"Yi\"* means plainness—speaking of the ultimate subtlety of the **Dao/Way**, its essence transcends the five colors, so it cannot be discerned by the eyes. Thus, it is called *Yi*—smooth and equal, without variation.\n\nHearing it yet not hearing is called *Xi*.\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\n*Xi* is the subtle sound. The **Dao/Way** is not sound, so it cannot be heard. Yet within no-sound, it alone harmonizes all sounds; thus, it is named *Xi*.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\n*\"Xi\"* means no-sound—one without audible tones, yet heard through the spirit.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\nThe Great Sound is subtle without voice; the ears cannot hear it. Yet the sage penetrates its depths, hearing its harmony alone. It is called *Xi*—profound and elusive, teaching hard to encounter. *Xi* is the natural way.\n\n○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:\n*Xi* means simplicity and fewness—its essence is not the notes of the five tones, so it cannot be grasped by the ear. Thus, it is called *Xi*—the subtle.\n\nTouching it yet not obtaining is called *Wei*.\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\n*Wei* is the grasp of form. The **Dao/Way** has no shape, so it cannot be held. Yet within no-form, it alone assumes all forms; thus, it is named *Wei*.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\n*\"Wei\"* means no-form—one without tangible substance, yet perceived through spirit alone. It cannot be grasped by touch.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\nThe Great Symbol is formless, hard to touch. Yet the sage’s profound insight knows the void, and thus *Wei* is the subtle mechanism. It moves and responds to things, surpassing all distinctions of existence and non-existence.\n\n○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:\n*Wei* means subtle and wondrous—its essence is not corporeal, so it cannot be touched. Thus, it is called *Wei*—the subtle and wondrous.\n\nAgain, *Master Zang*’s threefold unity refers to *spirit-qi-essence* (神炁精). *Spirit* (精) is the name for luminous wisdom, *God* (神) is the function beyond measure, and *Qi* (炁) is the aspect of form. The sage unites these three into one.\n\nIf it is unseen, that is *spirit*; if unheard, that is *God*; if untouchable, that is *Qi*. Yet since it is unseen, unheard, and untouchable, one might say it is no-color and no-form. But why then speak of *Yi Xi Wei*?\n\nThe ultimate **Dao/Way** is indeed without color, yet it does not utterly vanish. If it vanished entirely, it would merge with the *Great Void* (太虚), leading to a denial of perception. Now, it is named *Yi Xi Wei*—color without color, sound without sound, form without form—thus the term.\n\nThe second meaning is: though three, it is one; though one, it is three. These three cannot be questioned, so they are merged into one.\n\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\nThese three—*Yi Xi Wei*—are meant to question the **Dao/Way**, but the **Dao/Way** is neither sound, color, nor form. Thus, questioning yields no answer, and only *Yi Xi Wei* is obtained. The **Dao/Way** is not *Yi Xi Wei*, so the three are merged into one.\n\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\nThese three—*Yi Xi Wei*—cannot be questioned. *Zhi* (致) means to obtain, *Jie* (诘) means to interrogate, and *Hun* (混) means to merge. The wondrous origin is subtle and profound; *spirit-qi-essence* are hard to name. How can one interrogate with color, sound, and form?\n\nIf one interrogates with color, sound, and form, only *Yi Xi Wei* is obtained. Yet if one calls it *Yi Xi Wei*, it is but a borrowed name. To truly reveal the **Dao/Way**, one must know that it is not sound, color, or form—thus, *Yi Xi Wei* is merged into one.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\nThese three cannot be questioned—*Yi Xi Wei*. The mouth cannot speak of them, nor can scriptures transmit them. They are received with stillness, sought with spirit, and cannot be interrogated to obtain. Thus, they are merged into one. *Hun* means to combine, so the three are combined into one name.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\n*Yi Xi Wei* are the three. All are beyond sound and color, transcending form and name, so they cannot be questioned or measured. Merged into the undifferentiated, they are named as one. One is not self-made one; it arises from the three. Three is not self-made three; it arises from the one. From one arises three, yet three is one-three. From three arises one, yet one is three-one.\n\nOne does not become one, so three does not become three. Only when three does not become three is there no three. One does not become one, so there is no one. Without one and without three, it aligns with the logic of speechlessness. Grasping one or three stifles the flow of profound understanding.\n\n○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:\nThese three are *Yi Xi Wei*. *Zhi* (致) means to obtain, *Jie* (诘) means to interrogate, and *Hun* (混) means to combine. The true and responsive are one, yet they manifest as three teachings. The meaning is fully explained in the opening passage.\n\nAgain, another interpretation: the true and responsive **Dao/Way** itself assumes three forms of teaching. Their meaning is already present in the opening passage.\n\nThe third chapter reveals the Dao/Way as beyond the grasp of both foolishness and wisdom, transcending all named speech. Its upper reaches are not luminous, its lower depths are not obscure.\n\n**御注 (Imperial Annotation):**\nThose above must be luminous, those below must be obscure. Yet the Dao/Way, though above, is not above; though above, it is not luminous. Though below, it is not below; though below, it is not obscure.\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary):**\n*Jiao* (皎) means luminous; *mei* (昧) means dark. All things of form and substance have fixed places—those above are luminous, those below are dark. Yet the wondrous origin is hazy and indistinct, defying definition. Thus, though above, it is not luminous; though below, it is not obscure. Yet it can be above and below, luminous and obscure, unless one attains the utmost subtlety of the world—who else could comprehend this?\n\n**River Upper Master (河上公) says:**\nIts upper reaches are not luminous—speaking of the One in the heavens, not dazzling with brilliance. The Dao/Way extends without limit above and below.\nIts lower depths are not obscure—speaking of the One in the world below, not shrouded in darkness.\n\n**Master Rong (荣) says:**\nIts upper reaches are not luminous, its lower depths are not obscure—\n*Chengcheng* (乘乘), like drifting without anchor.\nThe Dao/Way rides the myriad things yet remains unattached.\nIt cannot be named luminous or obscure, neither color nor sound,\nYet it can be perceived by sight and hearing.\nWhen the subtle and lofty principle is still, the three-one’s essence is empty—\nTranscending all things, it returns to nothingness.\nWhat does \"nothingness\" return to if nothing exists?\nOne must know the void itself is void—\nThis is the profound beyond the profound, the boundless beyond bounds.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**\n*Jiao* (皎) means luminous; *mei* (昧) means dark.\nThe supreme Dao/Way is so subtle that it is neither foolishness nor wisdom.\nAscending beyond the Three Purities, it does not increase its luminosity;\nDescending into the Nine Abysses, it does not deepen its obscurity—\nThis is the \"neither increase nor decrease,\" found here.\n\n*Chengcheng* (绳绳) is beyond naming, returning to nothingness.\n**御注 (Imperial Annotation):**\n*Chengcheng* signifies unceasing motion.\nNeither luminous nor obscure, its motion is boundless—\nThe function of giving birth to things cannot be named,\nYet it constantly generates life without ever being a thing itself.\nThe wondrous origin is serene and profound—\nThus it returns to nothingness.\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary):**\n*Chengcheng* signifies unceasing motion.\nThe wondrous origin generates and transforms, its motion boundless.\nThe function of giving birth to things cannot be forcibly named—\nIt things things without being a thing,\nIt generates without being generation.\nTo seek it is futile—its origin is serene and profound,\nNever having been a thing—\nThus it returns to nothingness.\n\n**River Upper Master (河上公) says:**\n*Chengcheng* is beyond naming—*chengcheng* means motion without end.\nIt cannot be named as a single color—\nNot distinguishable by blue, yellow, red, white, or black.\nIt is not a single sound—\nNot discernible by the five musical notes.\nIt is not a single form—\nNot measurable by length, shortness, greatness, or smallness.\nTo return to nothingness—*wu* (物) means substance—\nIt must return to the formless.\n\n**Master Yan (严) says:**\nDeep and drifting, returning to the void—\nCurving to form the myriad things, all preserved.\nExhausting the subtle and attaining the marvelous—\nAll is thus realized.\nFlowing above and below, none can perceive its absence.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**\n*Chengcheng* means upright, like the straightedge and plumb line.\nThe Sage, having governed himself, also governs others—\nThus it cannot be grasped by names or sought in reason—\nHence it is beyond naming.\nAnother interpretation: *chengcheng* depicts motion—\nThe supreme Dao/Way turns the heavens and earth, molding living beings,\nYet sight and hearing cannot trace it—\nThus it is beyond naming.\n*Fùguī* (复归) means returning to the source.\n*Wúwù* (无物) refers to the wondrous origin.\nWhen responding to circumstances and descending into traces,\nIt becomes visible and audible.\nYet returning to its root, it is nameless and formless—\nThus it returns to nothingness.\n\nThe fourth chapter: Though not color or sound, it responds to things without form.\nThis is called the *zhuàng* (状) of the formless, the *xiàng* (象) of the formless—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng* (惚恍).\n\n**御注 (Imperial Annotation):**\nThis is the *zhuàng* of the formless, the *xiàng* of the formless substance—\nIt cannot be named as having, nor as not having.\nThe difficulty of naming the non-existent—\nThus it is called *hūhuǎng*.\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary):**\n*Zhuàng* means form; *xiàng* means appearance.\nThe wondrous origin is mixed and complete—\nOriginally without form or substance,\nYet all transformations draw from it, and things flow into forms.\nThus it can be called the *zhuàng* of the formless,\nThe *xiàng* of the formless substance—\nIt cannot be named as having, nor confined to non-existence.\nThe difficulty of naming the non-existent—\nThus it is called *hūhuǎng*.\n\n**River Upper Master (河上公) says:**\nThis is the *zhuàng* of the formless—\nThe One has no form, yet it shapes all things.\nThe *xiàng* of the formless—\nThe One has no substance, yet it establishes all appearances.\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*—\nThe One is hazy and indistinct, as if existing and vanishing,\nNot visible.\n\n**Master Yan (严) says:**\nThe *zhuàng* of the formless is without limit in its forming;\nThe *xiàng* of the formless is without limit in its appearing.\nIlluminating in *hūhuǎng*, it reveals all—\nGreat yet appearing small, existing yet appearing nonexistent.\n\n**Master Rong (荣) says:**\nTranscending the existent and returning to the nonexistent—\nThe nonexistent has no color.\nPerceived by sight and hearing, it aligns with the subtle and lofty—\nWhen the subtle and lofty become still, fear arises for those lost on the path,\nWho cling to the formless, showing the astray the way back.\nFurther opening the *zhuàng* of the formless—\nThis arises from essence and manifests function.\nThe *xiàng* of the formless is self-responsive and returns to truth—\nSelf-responsive and returning to truth, it gathers traces and returns to the root.\nFrom essence arises function—this is the motion of stillness.\nThe motion of stillness speaks of its non-existence—\nSuddenly, there is existence.\nGathering traces and returning to the root speaks of its existence—\nSuddenly, there is non-existence.\nSuddenly non-existent—this is fixed non-existence.\nSuddenly existent—this is not fixed existence.\nExistence and non-existence in *hūhuǎng*—none can name it.\n\n「○ Master Cheng’s Commentary: This is the *zhuàng* of the formless, the *xiàng* of the non-existent.\nThe formless can yet manifest transformation—hence its *xiàng* is called *zhuàng*.\nThe fifth insight reveals neither non-existence nor existence, neither antiquity nor modernity.\n迎之不見其首，隨之不見其後。\n迎之者 cannot perceive its beginning, 隨之者 cannot perceive its end.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Commentary: Without origin, hence迎之者 cannot perceive its beginning.\n無終，故隨之者不得其後。\nWithout termination, hence 隨之者 cannot perceive its end.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Commentary: The utmost subtlety is formless, the utmost vastness can encompass all.\nHence迎之者 cannot perceive its beginning, 隨之者 cannot perceive its end.\n無首則無始，無後即無終。\nWithout beginning, there is no origin; without end, there is no termination.\n無始無終，故非隨迎所得也。\nWithout origin or termination, it is not what迎之者 or 隨之者 can grasp.\n\n○ Lord of Héshàng said: The one without shadow or trace—this may be seen and known.\n\n○ Róng said: Existence has a beginning that can be approached, non-existence has an end that can be traced.\n迎不見，非有。\nIf it cannot be迎ed, it is not existence.\n隨之不見，非無也。\nIf it cannot be隨ed, it is not non-existence.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:迎 cannot perceive its beginning—this reveals the Dao is neither ancient nor originless.\n隨不見其後—this reveals the Dao is neither modern nor endless.\n\nThe sixth insight clarifies that the ancient and the modern are its guiding principles and threads.\n执古之道，以御今之有。\nTo grasp the ancient Dao of non-action (*wúwéi*) and apply it to the present state of action (*yǒuwéi*)—\n○ Master Yu’s Commentary: To grasp the ancient Dao of non-action and apply it to the present affairs of action,\nthen one returns to the simplicity of the pristine.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Commentary: This insight clarifies the ancient sovereigns,\nwho could transform through the Dao of non-action and thereby transform others.\nHence, the admonition urges one to uphold the ancient practice of non-action,\nto govern the present affairs of action—\nthen speech is not needed for transformation to occur.\n\n○ Lord of Héshàng said: The Sage holds fast to the ancient Dao,\ngenerates the one to govern all things,\nand knows that in the present there must also be the one.\n\n○ Róng said: 御 is to rectify.\nThe ancient Dao of non-action is rectification.\nThe modern Dao of action is sagacity.\nThe Sage upholds the Dao of non-action to rectify action,\nto still the trend of superficiality and return to the harmonious transformation of the pristine.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Commentary: 执 is to hold.\nThis speaks of the Sage holding the Dao of the primordial antiquity—\nwhen names had not yet arisen—\nand adjusting the present state of existence.\n\nTo know the ancient origin is called the Dao’s guiding principles and threads.\n○ Master Yu’s Commentary: To know the ancient origin and its practices—\nthis is called the guiding principles and threads of Daoist transformation.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Commentary: Earlier it was said, \"To grasp the ancient Dao\"—\nthis was to lead and guide it in practice.\nHere it is said, \"To know the ancient origin\"—\nthis clarifies that the Dao’s practice must inevitably transform.\nHence, it is reiterated that sovereigns of old knew the ancient origin,\ngoverned through non-action, and thus embraced the simplicity of the pristine.\nThose who could achieve clarity and stillness—\nthis is knowing the guiding principles and threads of the Dao for governance.\n\n○ Lord of Héshàng said: If a person knows the Dao of the upper antiquity,\nthe origin is one—this is called knowing the guiding principles and threads of the Dao.\n\n○ Yán said: To grasp the ancient Dao naturally and apply it to the present,\nnot altering for barbarians, then it does not change for the Central States.\nOne knows the beginning through the one, one knows the end through the one,\ngoverning by the Dao—all things hang suspended from it,\nit dominates all, it oversees all.\nIts role is vast and great—\nnothing it does not govern.\nIt is the guiding principles and threads of emptiness,\nthe ancestral origin of heaven and earth.\n\n○ Róng said: The Dao of the mysterious antiquity is difficult to know,\nthe Dao of non-action is rarely comprehended.\nAbove, it rectifies below; below, it follows above to eliminate—\nthis is the essential principle of attaining the Dao.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Commentary: The ancient origin is the Dao without name.\nIf one knows that it has neither beginning nor end,\nyet it ends and begins,\nneither antiquity nor modernity,\nyet it is ancient and modern—\nto apply this ancient Dao to the present world,\none may be called the guiding principles and threads of the utmost Dao.\n\n**The Fifteenth Chapter: The Ancient Sage Who Skillfully Practices the Dao**\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous is that the previous chapter\nestablished the refined state of cultivation as subtly lofty (*xīyí*),\nwhile this chapter reveals the profound and elusive wisdom of those who can cultivate it.\nThe union of state and wisdom—this is why it follows.\n\nNow, within this chapter, three distinctions are opened.\n\nThe first clarifies those who can cultivate the Dao—\ntheir wisdom and virtue are profound and far-reaching.\nThe second emphasizes their outward appearance,\nso that all things conform to their cultivation.\nThe third reveals that their motion and stillness are indistinguishable,\nhence their ability to unite in emptiness.\n\n**The First: Clarifying Those Who Can Cultivate the Dao—Wisdom and Virtue Profound and Far-Reaching.**\nThe origin of the great Dao is difficult to seek,\nthe subtle *xiàng* of its form is invisible.\nRiding dragons and harnessing *qi*,\nsoaring through the verdant caves,\nsteering cranes with their wings bound,\ngliding over the red mounds in ease—\nits nature is still,\nits form is true.\nIf not compared to the present age,\nall ranks would strive to attain it yet fail.\nTo walk the Dao,\none knows the snow of three winters is deep—\nsuddenly arriving at the formless,\none fears the neighbors’ four directions may awaken to awareness.\n\nCultivation such as this—\nits state is as lofty as this—\nhow could this be the case for one who has not yet awakened,\nwho lets emotions run wild,\nwho lives in the realm of the five desires,\nand dies entering the three *tú*?\nHow could one recognize the heart of the ancient Sage,\nwho holds himself in such self-regard?\n\nThose ancient Sages who skillfully practiced the Dao—\nsubtle, mysterious, and far-reaching,\ndeeply incomprehensible.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Commentary: 士 is \"affairs.\"\nThis speaks of the ancient ones who skillfully practiced the Dao as their affairs,\nrefining its subtle and profound essence—\nmysterious, deep, and far-reaching—\nthey embodied the Dao and understood its words,\nvast and unobstructed,\nyet their breadth and depth were incomprehensible.\n\n○ Lord of Héshàng said: The ancient Sages who skillfully practiced the Dao—\nthis refers to the rulers who employed the Dao.\nSubtle, mysterious, and far-reaching—\n*xiàn* is heaven.\nThis speaks of their resolve and conduct as subtle and mysterious,\ntheir spirit in harmony with heaven.\n\nDeeply incomprehensible—\nthe Dao’s virtue is profound and distant,\nbeyond recognition.\nInternally gazing, like the blind;\nexternally listening, like the deaf.\nNo one knows their strengths.\n\n○ Yán said: Above, they penetrate the meaning of the Dao and virtue;\nbelow, they reveal the heart of the divine and enlightened.\nThey hold the constants of heaven and earth,\nthey grasp the changes of yin and yang,\nyet they conceal their form and appearance,\nerase all traces,\nact through inversion,\nand remain beyond recognition.»\n\n「○ Róng said: The Dao of old was difficult to practice,\nand the ancient *zhìshì* (知士, \"wise ones\") could follow it.\nThe Dao is subtle and essential, mysterious and tranquil, void yet penetrating.\nIts practice is also supremely delicate and minute,\nunobstructed and without stagnation.\nWhen action aligns with the Dao, it becomes unfathomable and hard to know—\ncannot be spoken of, for the speaker is not the Dao;\ncannot be perceived, for the perceiver strays from the true.\nThus it is said: *unrecognizable*.\n\n○ Chéng’s commentary: The ancient *shànwéishì* (善为士者, \"those who skillfully cultivated the Dao\")\n—*gu* (古, \"ancient\") is *xī* (昔, \"of old\"),\n*shàn* (善, \"skillful\") is the opposite of *è* (恶, \"evil\").\n*Wéi* (为, \"cultivate\") means *xiūxué* (修学, \"to study and refine\").\nThe previous chapter held ancient principles to govern the present,\nwhile this chapter governs the present by invoking the ancient,\nthus presenting the *xī* (昔, \"of old\") *shàn xiūdào zhī shì* (善修道之士, \"wise ones who refined the Dao\")\nas a model for those who seek to learn.\nSubtle and mysterious, yet profound beyond recognition—\n*wéimiào* (微妙, \"subtle and essential\") is the wisdom to cultivate,\n*xiāntōng* (玄通, \"mysterious and penetrating\") is the realm to be refined.\nRealm and wisdom converge,\nand both cultivator and object are deep—\nit cannot be grasped by the mind,\nthus it is praised as *unrecognizable*.\n\nSecondly, they manifest outward form\nto guide others in their cultivation.\nFor only the *unrecognizable* can thus guide:\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Since the Dao’s virtue is hard to recognize,\nthey manifest outward form to reveal it—\nreferring to the following passage.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Form (容, *róng*) is appearance (相貌, *xiàngmào*).\nThe Dao is hard to contemplate,\nits practice hard to perceive—\nlest those who come later lack the preparation to grasp the Dao,\nor learners fail to establish proper conduct,\nthe following passage briefly outlines outward form\nto encourage and exhort them.\n\n*Chéng’s commentary*: Form (容, *róng*) is outward appearance (形貌, *xíngmào*).\nThis *unrecognizable* wisdom of the sages\nis most worthy of guiding others.\nNow seeking to draw in all ranks of practitioners,\nthey thus manifest outward form\neven in the Dao’s formless principle.\n\nLike one crossing a winter river—\n*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yù* (豫, \"prepared\") means *xián yù* (闲豫, \"leisurely ease\").\nThe *shànshì* (善士, \"wise ones\") of old, hearing the Dao in their times,\nwere like crossing a winter river—\nthe masses cling to desires,\nthus they feared and hesitated.\nNow I am untainted,\nso I am at ease.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yù* (豫, \"prepared\") means *yóuyù* (犹豫, \"hesitation\"), hesitation born of fear.\nIt speaks of those who study the Dao,\nfearing the entanglements of worldly affairs and desires,\nas one crossing a winter river—\nthe heart trembles with dread,\nfearing to sink or drown.\nThis reveals the purity of their intentions.\n\nLike one fearing the neighbors—\n*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yóu* (犹, \"like\") is hesitation (疑难, *yí nán*),\n*wèi* (畏, \"fear\") is dread.\nNow I am untainted—\nas mentioned above, the *shànshì* (善士) do not cling to desires,\nyet when observing their conduct,\neach movement and action is met with suspicion,\nlike a man fearing his neighbors’ awareness.\nAs those of old,\nwhen facing affairs, they dreaded the scrutiny of their neighbors,\nthus they were cautious and restrained.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: To dwell in the world yet act wickedly,\none fears neighbors and kinsmen may awaken to their deeds.\nTo follow the Dao and do good,\none fears the *yōumíng* (幽明, \"hidden and manifest\")\nmay censure their shortcomings.\nThis reveals the purity of their speech.\n\nLike a guest in solemnity,\nlike ice about to melt—\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Though they appear solemn as guests,\nwith no artificial deeds,\nthey do not cling to things—\ndissolving like spring ice, scattering away.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: The *shànshì* (善士) do no harm to desires,\nlike guests facing their hosts—\nsolemn and respectful.\nThough they face desires as guests do their hosts,\ntheir virtuous conduct does not cling to things—\ndissolving like spring ice,\nunimpeded and free.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Like a guest in solemnity,\none must act only when necessary—\ncultivation of the Dao should not be reckless.\nLike ice about to turn to water,\nwhen spring’s warmth arrives, the ice melts,\nand the mysterious wind arises, dissolving all burdens.\n\n*Chéng’s commentary*: Like a guest in solemnity—\n*yǎn* (俨, \"solemn\"), the bearing of dignity.\nThe *Jì* (记) says: *\"Yǎn ruò sī\"* (俨若思, \"solemn as in contemplation\"),\nmeaning those who study must restrain and discipline their body and mind,\nnot indulging in recklessness,\nlike a guest facing their host—\nthey must not be frivolous.\nThis reveals the purity of their bodily conduct.\n\n*Xián* (涣, \"dissolving\") means to disperse and release.\nAs in the earlier passage on cultivation—\nwhen wisdom brightens deeply,\nit may dissolve like ice in spring warmth.」\n\n「**Thick and unadorned, like the plainness of wood**—\n*Yu’s Annotation*: Though dissolved like melting ice,\nnever boasting of itself,\nyet it remains thick and sincere,\nunmarked by distinctions.\n\n*Yu’s Commentary*: **Thick** (敦) means sincere and thick-set;\n**plain** (朴) means unadorned and natural.\nThough it does not cling to things,\nyet it utterly rejects superficiality,\nits virtue and conduct sincere and thick,\nplain as wood without distinctions.\n\n*He Shànggōng* says: **Thick** means sincere and substantial;\n**plain** means form yet undivided,\ninnerly guarding the spirit,\nouterly without ornament.\n\n*Róng* says: Thick yet not thin,\nsubstantial yet not ostentatious.\n\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Thick** (敦) means pure and sincere;\n**plain** (朴) means innate nature.\nSince the threefold conduct* has already been purified,\nand entanglements dispersed,\nits virtue and conduct are pure and harmonious,\ndiscarding ornament for substance.\n\n*Vast, like an empty valley*—\n*Yu’s Annotation*: Its virtue vast and spacious,\nall-embracing without exclusion,\nlike that empty valley.\n\n*Yu’s Commentary*: **Vast** (旷) means expansive.\nThe virtuous one, embracing the Dao and nurturing virtue,\npossesses a vast and magnanimous scope,\ncapable of receiving all things,\nlike that hollow valley,\nall-embracing without limit.\n\n*He Shànggōng* says: **Vast** means spacious and grand;\n**valley** means hollow and void,\nwithout seeking fame in virtue,\nits function all-embracing.\n\n*Róng* says: The valley’s hollowness\nholds things while echoing sounds.\nThe heart’s hollowness\nembraces the Dao while aiding the world.\n\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: When dusty burdens are exhausted,\nthe heart’s purity is clear and white,\nthus its Dao and virtue vast and spacious,\nall-embracing like the valley.\n\n**Mixed, like turbid water**—\n*Yu’s Annotation*: Blending light with harmony,\nadvancing undifferentiated,\nlike turbid water that clears.\n\n*Yu’s Commentary*: The virtuous one’s heart reflects pure stillness,\nyet it can contain all things,\nblending light with dust,\nunmarked by distinction,\nmixed like turbid water—\nnone can perceive it.\n\n*He Shànggōng* says: **Mixed** means guarding the true essence;\n**turbid** means not reflecting.\nYet it aligns with the crowd,\nnever self-exalting.\n\n*Róng* says: The heart without distinction is **mixed**;\nalignment with the world is **turbid**.\nHolding jade without stain,\ngrasping pearls while self-luminous—\nthis appears turbid.\n\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Mixed** (混) means blending with diversity;\n**turbid** (浊) means conditioned action.\nThough the heart is pure and undefiled,\nobstacles and entanglements dispersed,\nyet within the undifferentiated chaos,\nit does not differ from dust and turbidity.\n\nThirdly, it shows motion and stillness as unchanging,\nthus able to gather in emptiness.\n\nWho can quiet the turbid,\ngradually making it clear?\n\n*Yu’s Annotation*: **Who** (孰), meaning *who*?\nWho can, in that mixed turbidity,\nuse stillness to settle and halt it,\nso that it may gradually clear?\n\n*Yu’s Commentary*: Following the earlier passage on turbid water,\nit raises the analogy of water’s settling to clarity,\nto illustrate the virtuous one’s heart—\nwithout stain, it naturally stills.\nThus it says: Who can, in the midst of worldly loves and desires,\nthat turbid and mixed,\nuse the pure stillness of Dao-nature to settle them,\nso that loves and desires do not arise?\nOr, like water’s turbidity settling,\ngradually becoming clear.\n**Who**, meaning *who*?\n\n*He Shànggōng* says: **Who**, meaning *who*?\nWho can remain still for long,\ngradually enduring to live on?\n\n*Róng* says: **Still** (安) means tranquil;\n**gradually** (徐) means slow progression.\nFor when motion ceases in the heart,\nthe spirit naturally stills;\nwhen no disturbance touches the water,\nits turbidity naturally clears.\nFew practice this way,\nhence it asks: *Who can*?\n\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Gradually** (徐) means slow and unhurried.\nThough in the midst of desires,\naligned with worldly affairs yet unstained,\nthe heart remains ever tranquil,\nleisurely and pure.\nEarlier, though clear, it could blend with turbidity;\nhere, though in turbidity, it does not abandon pure stillness,\nrevealing motion within stillness.\n\nWho can remain still for long,\nand let motion arise gradually?\n\n*Yu’s Annotation*: **Who** can remain tranquil in clarity for long,\nyet seek superior methods,\nstirring practice to motion,\nso that the nature of pure stillness\ndoes not stagnate in the method,\nbut gradually emerges in motion?\n**Motion** (动) is also **emerging** (出).\n\n*Yu’s Commentary*: This teaches **non-stagnation in method**.\nWho can, with the nature of pure stillness,\nsettle loves and desires,\nas water’s nature—\nonce it has settled and cleared,\nthen remain tranquil in that clarity,\nyet linger too long?\nLingering is not enlightenment,\nnot yet named as emerging.\nOne must always seek superior methods,\nstirring practice to deepen.\nThus it says: Who can remain tranquil in clarity for long,\nand let motion arise gradually?\n**Motion** (生) is also **emerging** (出).\n\n*He Shànggōng* says: **Who**, meaning *who*?\nWho can remain tranquil for long,\ngradually enduring to live on?\n\n*Róng* says: **Still** (安) means tranquil;\n**gradually** (徐) means slow progression.\nFor when motion ceases in the heart,\nthe spirit naturally stills;\nwhen no disturbance touches the water,\nits turbidity naturally clears.\nFew practice this way,\nhence it asks: *Who can*?\n\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: Though tranquil, it is stillness within motion;\nthough responding to motion, the heart remains ever leisurely,\ngiving birth to all transformed essences.\nThis reveals stillness within motion.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao\ndo not desire fullness.\n\n*Yu’s Annotation*: To preserve this gradually clearing, gradually emerging Dao,\none must not cling to anything;\nif one clings to clarity while seeking life,\nthat is called fullness—\none will lose this Dao.\nThus it says: *do not desire fullness*.\n\n*Yu’s Commentary*: Lingering in method while seeking clarity—\nthis is called fullness.\nThus it says: If one wishes to preserve this Dao of gradual clarity and emergence,\none must not cling to anything,\nattaining without attachment,\nyet if one lingers in clarity while seeking life,\nthat is called fullness.\nFullness obstructs the Dao,\nhence it says: *do not desire fullness*.\n\n*He Shànggōng* says: To preserve this Dao of gradual emergence,\none must not indulge in excess or extravagance,\nnor overflow with fullness.\n\n*Róng* says: The preceding passages expound the Dao’s conduct\nto encourage those who study.\nWhen one guards it,\none naturally attains clarity,\nits meaning lies in humility and retreat,\nnot seeking fullness.\n\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Preserve** (保) means hold fast;\n**fullness** (盈) means excess.\nIt says: Those who hold this Dao of motion and stillness as undivided\nmust not dwell in the middle while full.\nThis is to **discard the middle** (遣中).»\n\n---\n*Threefold conduct (三业): body, speech, and mind.*\n\n**The Threefold Conduct (三业): body, speech, and mind.**\n\n---\n\nNow the translation:\n\n「Indeed, only by not being full can one attain **defilement** (弊, *bì*—here meaning \"humility/lowliness\") and avoid **novelty** (新成, *xīnchéng*—here meaning \"artificial perfection\").\n*Yù’s Annotation*: Only those who do not cling to fullness can thus attain **defilement** (弊) through **novelty** (新证, *xīnzhèng*). Their conduct is humble and lowly, not lingering in the attainment of **novelty** (新成).\n*Yù’s Commentary*: Those who can remain unfettered by attachments, reaching **non-action** (无为), and dwelling nowhere in **dharma** (法), can use the **novelty** (新证) of the **dharma** (法) to cultivate **defilement** (敝薄), yet still seek greater refinement, not clinging to **novelty** (新成) as if it were their final state.\n*He Shànggōng* says: Indeed, only those who do not cling to fullness can guard **defilement** (敝) and not seek **novelty** (新成). Those who guard **defilement** (敝) conceal **light and honor** (光荣).\n**Novelty** (新成) is the pursuit of **glory and renown** (功名).\n*Róng* says: In establishing one’s self, one must not reach fullness. In **rectifying and aiding** (匡辅), one must uphold **loyalty and rectitude** (忠正). Though aged, one returns to youth; though in **defilement** (敝), one renews. Those who study the Dao must **empty their hearts** (虚心) and abandon **sensual pleasures** (声色), while **washing away their worries** (澡虑) and **cleansing their disputes** (荡於纷争).\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: Only the **sage of discarding the middle** (遣中圣人) can, within the realm of **action** (有为) and **defilement** (敝浊), still **compassionately rescue** (慈救) the **masses** (苍生) and achieve **great virtue and merit** (大功德). This is the **double attainment** (重结成).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Attainment of the Supreme Void (致虚极章)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which elucidates the **meeting of perception and wisdom** (境智相会), thereby enabling the **marvelous attainment of the Supreme Mysterious** (妙极重玄). Thus, this chapter is placed next.\nIt reveals the **fruit of the Supreme Mysterious Dao** (重玄道果). In this chapter, the meaning is divided into three aspects:\n1. **Briefly marking the Dao’s fruit** (略标道果) to encourage beings to begin cultivation.\n2. **Exhorting a return to the origin and source** (劝返本还源), merging with the **root** (根) and **reclaiming the vital breath** (复命).\n3. **Illustrating the progression from small to great** (示从小入大), **wondrously aligning with the Supreme Void** (妙契虚玄).\n\n1. **Briefly marking the Dao’s fruit** (略标道果) to encourage beings to begin cultivation.\nThe **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **true essence** (真宗). Those who **quietly forget** (恬忘) its **vital principle** (要者) enter the **abode of the Rare and Strange** (希夷之奥), dwelling in the **dim and vague** (惚恍之先). Their **principle transcends all non-conformity** (理绝百非).\nThey may **recite the Four Sentences** (言忘四句) or **wander in the upper realms** (游上界), sitting upon **Péngyǔ** (蓬岳) and **concentrating their spirit** (凝神). At times, they descend to the **lower mundane** (下凡), holding a **boat’s oar** (舟航) to **assist beings** (接物).\nThey open the **vast expanse of the Dao’s realm** (大囿之境), and the **heavens and earth embrace it without limit** (天地纳之而不穷). They dwell in the **subtle and minute** (细微之中), yet even the **finest hairs and tips of grass** (毫末) cannot be sought to find them.\nTheir **principle is clear and free from strife** (厥理清争), and their **non-thinking is without announcement** (其不思告). Those who **quietly retreat** (静退) must **approach the Supreme Void** (臻虚极之道).\n\n**The Attainment of the Supreme Void** (致虚极) is **to steadfastly guard stillness** (守静笃).\n*Yù’s Annotation*: The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **wondrous origin** (妙本). It is said that all beings, upon taking birth, **inherit the Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (禀虚极妙本). Once they receive form and **begin to take and hold** (受纳), then the **wondrous origin disperses** (妙本离散).\nNow, if one wishes the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) to **necessarily manifest in the body** (致於身), one must **abandon dusty perceptions and attachments** (弃尘境染滞) and **steadfastly guard the female-stillness** (守此雌静笃厚). Then the **Supreme Void’s Dao** (虚极之道) will naturally **govern the body** (政於身).\n*Yù’s Commentary*: The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **wondrous origin** (妙本). It is said that all beings, upon taking birth, **inherit the Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (禀虚极妙本), which is their **original nature** (正性). Once they receive form, the **six senses cling to pleasure** (六根爱悦), and the **five desires vie in competition** (五欲奔竞), then the **original nature disperses** (正性离散), and they **lose the wondrous origin** (失妙本).\nNow, if one wishes the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) to **manifest and govern the body** (爻自政於身), one must **steadfastly guard the female-stillness** (守此雌静), **cultivate a profound and thick nature and disposition** (笃厚性情), and **sever desires** (绝欲). Without **narrowing** (狭) yet **not wearying**, the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) will naturally **manifest and govern the body** (自政於身).\nThis is like **water flowing to dampness** (流湿) and **fire tending to dryness** (就燥).\n**Attainment** (致) means to **invite it to manifest** (令爻自来), as in the **classical meaning of \"attaining a teacher\"** (如春秋致师之义).\n*He Shànggōng* says: **The Attainment of the Supreme Void** (致虚极) is when the **cultivator abandons emotions and desires** (修道之人捐情去欲), **cleansing the five viscera** (五内清净), and **attaining the Supreme Void** (致於虚极).\n**To steadfastly guard stillness** (守静笃) is to **guard purity** (守清净) and **practice profound virtue** (行笃厚).\n*Róng* says: If their **nature is upright and pure** (性正而贞), and their **conduct is clear and distant** (行清而远), those who **guard it with profundity** (守之厚者) may attain the **Supreme Void’s Dao** (虚极之道).\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Attainment** (致) means **to obtain** (得也). The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **fruit of the Dao** (道果). **Profound** (笃) means **central** (中也). It is said: If one wishes to obtain the **fruit of the wondrous and supremely void** (虚玄极妙之果), one must **quiet the heart and guard the central Dao** (静心守一中之道), then it may be obtained.\n\n2. **Exhorting a return to the origin and source** (劝返本还源), merging with the **root** (根) and **reclaiming the vital breath** (复命).\nAll things arise together; I observe their **return** (复).\n*Yù’s Annotation*: The **Laozi** (老君) says: How do we know that **guarding female-stillness** (守雌静) can **attain the Supreme Void** (致虚极)? We observe all things in **motion and action** (动作). Once we observe their **return** (归复), it is always in **stillness** (静), hence it is so.\n*Yù’s Commentary*: This clarifies that **steadfastly guarding stillness** (守静笃) **necessarily attains the Supreme Void** (必致虚极). All things and all forms, though their **motions and actions differ** (动作不同), once observed in their **return** (归复), always abide in their **origin** (本). The *Yìjīng* says: *\"Thunder within the earth—this is **Return** (复).\"* **Return** (复) means **to revert to the origin** (反本之谓也). Hence, **stillness returns** (静则归复), while **motion loses the origin** (动则失本).\n*He Shànggōng* says: All things arise together—**arise** (作) means **birth** (生也). All things are born together; I observe their **return** (复), meaning I observe all things, and they **all revert to their origin** (皆归其本). Thus, one should **contemplate their origin** (念其本).\n*Yán* says: It begins with **non-action** (无为), moves with **formlessness** (无形), **emerges in harmony with the seasons** (发於时和), thereby **fulfilling great success** (遂成功).\n*Róng* says: All things arise together—ordinary people cannot **guard non-action to maintain stillness** (守无为以安静), and for **emotions** (情) they **move and act** (动作), abandoning **truth** (真) to follow **deceit** (伪), losing their **origin** (本) and **pursuing the trivial** (逐末).\nI observe their **return** (复)—**return** (复) means **origin** (本). Ordinary people **lose their origin and pursue the trivial** (失本而逐末), **abandoning purity to enter impurity** (离淳以入浇). The **sage suppresses the trivial and honors the origin** (圣人抑末而崇本), **returning impurity to restore simplicity** (返浇以还朴).\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Arise** (作) means **to move and act** (动用也). It is said that all beings, in their **arising and acting** (并皆云为), **covetously grasp at external phenomena** (贪逐前境). Yet with the **Laozi’s holy wisdom** (老君圣智) observing them, all **revert to the wondrous origin** (复在妙本), whether in motion or stillness.\n\nThe myriad things, though **flourishing and diverse** (芸芸), **each return to their root** (各复归其根).\n*Yù’s Annotation*: Again, it is said: How do we know that all things **return to stillness** (归复), always abiding in **stillness** (静)? Because all things, in their **flourishing and diverse** (花叶芸芸), **naturally revert to their roots** (生性皆复归於其根). Hence, though they **arise in flourishing diversity** (有作芸芸), their **motions and actions** (动作) all return to their **roots and origins** (根本).\n*Yù’s Commentary*: This illustrates the **meaning of observing their return** (观复之意). The **root** (根) is where the **origin receives qi** (本所受气) and **gives rise to form** (而生也).\n\nNow observing the myriad things, their **flourishing and diverse** (花叶芸芸) forms and their **inherent natures** (生性) all **return to their roots** (复归於其根) and **renew anew** (而更生). The **void’s utmost subtlety** (虚极) and **wondrous origin** (妙本) are what humans **receive and from which they are born** (人所禀而生也). Now observing **emotions and desires** (情欲) **abundant and restless** (熙熙), if one **preserves stillness** (守静) and **attains emptiness** (致虚), then their **true nature returns** (正性归复) to the **original essence** (命元) and they may **endure long** (而长久矣).\n\n---\n**Yóng’s Commentary**: Things are also like humans, and **roots** (根) are also **origins** (本). It is said that humans, with a **single mind**, grasp at the **verdant myriad realms** (攀绿万境), and their affairs are **not singular** (其事非一), hence **flourishing and diverse** (芸芸). The **Sages all exhort to return to the origin** (圣人皆劝以反本), hence it is said that each **returns to its root** (各归其根).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Flourishing and diverse** (芸芸) describes **multitude** (众多貌也). It is said that the reason living beings **cannot align with the Sage’s heart** (不能同於圣心), though they move or rest (虽动不动), and act without intention (用而无心), is because their **restless striving never ceases** (只为芸芸驰竞不息也). If one **returns to the origin and roots** (能反本归根), they will **align with the Sage’s illumination** (即同於圣照)—this is the exhortation. **Returning to the root** (归根) is **stillness** (曰静), and **stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命).\n\n**Yù’s Annotation**: Those whose **forms flourish and diversify** (花叶芸芸) have **natures that return to their roots** (生性归根), thus they **become still** (则静止矣). When humans **return to the root and attain utmost stillness** (能归根至静), it may be said they **restore what they originally received** (可谓复所禀之性命也).\n\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: Things **returning to their roots** (物归根) become **tranquil** (则安静), and humans **preserving stillness** (人守静) **attain emptiness** (则致虚). Trees **receive life from their roots** (木之禀生者根), and **returning to the root** (归根) is **restoring their essence** (故复命). Humans **receive life from the wondrous origin** (人禀生者妙本); now, if they **preserve stillness and attain emptiness** (今能守静致虚), it may be said they **return to what they originally received** (可谓归复所禀之性命矣).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Returning to the root** (归根) is **stillness** (日静), and **stillness** (静) refers to **the root** (谓根也). The root is **tranquil, soft, and weak** (安静柔弱), **humble and lowly** (谦卑处下), hence it **cannot die** (故不能死也). **Stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命), meaning that **tranquility** (安静者) is **returning the essence and life** (是谓复还性命) so that they **do not die** (使不死也).\n\n**Yán’s Commentary**: Heaven and Earth **reverse and return** (反复), hence they **endure long** (故能长久). Humans **return to repose** (复寝寐), hence they **become keen-witted** (故能聪明). Dragons and snakes **return to their coiled state** (复垫), hence they **manifest transformations** (故能彰变). Grasses and trees **return to their roots** (复本), hence they **remain verdant** (故能青青). **Returning** (复) allows the **spirit and clarity** (神明) to **find their proper place** (得位), **communing with the void** (与虚无通), the **soul rests** (魂休), the **ether rests** (魄息), each **finding its place of ease** (各得所安宁), the **qi harmonizes** (气顺), and the **blood vessels balance** (血脉和平也).\n\n**Yóng’s Commentary**: **At the periphery**, this is why there is **cyclic rebirth** (所以轮回也). **Returning to the origin** (反本) is **serene and unmoving** (寂然不动), and **stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命). In **near terms**, the **forceful and violent** (强梁) **cannot meet their end** (不得其死), and this is called **dying in the midst of life** (名之中夭). **Preserving emptiness and stillness** (虚静) **safeguards one’s natural lifespan** (保其天年), which is called **restoring the original essence** (是谓复命). In **far-reaching terms**, **movement brings life and death** (动则有生有死), **losing one’s true nature** (失於其性), while **stillness brings neither death nor life** (静则不死不生), **returning to the original blessing** (复於惠命也).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Returning to the root** (归根) is **stillness** (日静), but if one **returns to the origin and source** (能返本还源), the **restless striving of the heart naturally ceases** (驰竞之心自息也). **Stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命), for **original essence** (命) is the **true nature and blessed life** (真性惠命也). Having **set aside clamor and dust** (既屏息嚣尘), the **heart and spirit become concentrated and serene** (心神凝寂), hence they **return to their true nature** (故复於真性) and **revert to the blessed life** (反於惠命). **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (曰常), and **knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (曰明).\n\n**Yù’s Annotation**: **Preserving stillness and restoring the original essence** (守静复命) may be called **having constancy** (可谓有常). **Knowing constancy** (知守常者) **increases clarity** (更益明了).\n\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常). If one **steadfastly preserves the receptive stillness** (能守雌静笃厚), and **attains the void’s utmost subtlety and wondrous origin** (以致虚极妙本), then **emptiness** (虚) **restores the original essence** (则复命), and this may be called **attaining constancy** (可谓得常矣). **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明); **not knowing constancy** (不知常) and **acting recklessly** (妄作) is **calamitous** (凶), which may be called **lacking steadfastness** (可谓无恒). **Not steadfast in virtue** (不恒其德) leads to **ruin and calamity** (穷凶必矣). The annotation says: **\"Not steadfast in virtue\"** (不恒其德), or perhaps **shame follows** (或承之羞), is from the *Yì* **Constancy (Héng) Hexagram’s text** (《易》恒卦词也).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常), **restoring the original essence to prevent death** (复命使不死), which is the **Dao’s perpetual practice** (乃道之所常行). **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明), for those who **know the Dao’s perpetual practice** (能知道之常行者) are **clear** (则为明也).\n\n**Yóng’s Commentary**: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常). There is **life and death** (有死有生), hence it is **interrupted** (故断). **Neither death nor life** (不死不生), hence **knowing constancy** (故知常) is **clarity** (日明). Those who **lose this principle** (迷斯理者) are **obscured** (暗), while those who **awaken to this Way** (悟此道者) are **clear** (明).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常), **returning to the true nature and original essence** (反於性命), **concentrated and serene** (凝然湛然), **neither life nor death** (不复生死), hence it is called **constancy** (因之日常). **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明), for those who **know the principle of returning to the true, constant essence** (既知反命真常之理者) will have **wise and enlightened clarity** (则智惠明照), **illuminating even the most hidden** (无幽不烛). **Not knowing constancy** (不知常) and **acting recklessly** (妄作) is **calamitous** (凶). The annotation says: **\"Not steadfast in virtue\"** (不恒其德), or perhaps **shame follows** (或承之羞), for **losing constancy and acting recklessly** (失常妄作) leads to **ruin and calamity** (穷凶铃矣).

The annotation says: **\"Not steadfast in virtue\"** (不怛其德), or perhaps **shame follows** (或承之羞), is from the *Yì* **Constancy (Héng) Hexagram’s text** (《易》恒卦辞也).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Not knowing the Dao’s perpetual practice** (不知道之所常行), **acting deceitfully and craftily** (妄作巧诈), then **losing the spirit and clarity** (则失神明), hence **calamity** (故凶也).\n\n**Yán’s Commentary**: Those who **lose the Dao** (失道之人) **abandon constancy** (废弃经常), **pursue cleverness** (事其聪明), **indulge their desires** (纵其志欲), and **act recklessly in calamitous ways** (妄作凶行), hence **knowing brings punishment** (故知以受祸), **clarity brings misfortune** (明以造殃), **deep insight leads to death** (深察以死), and **vast knowledge brings ruin** (博辨以亡). Why is this so? Because they **do not return to the primal origin** (不反元始), **do not restore the original root** (不复本根), their **actions conflict with the Dao** (动与道乖), and their **stillness diverges from the spirit** (静与神殊). Thus, **what they seek to preserve cannot be preserved** (存故不能存也), and **what they seek to actualize cannot be actualized** (然故不能然也).\n\n**Yóng’s Commentary**: **Knowing constancy and trusting the Dao** (知常信道), all their actions are **virtuous** (所行皆善), hence **Heaven aids and humans assist** (天佑人助), which is why it is said to be **auspicious** (吉). If all **follow the Dao’s deviations** (皆道从邪), **indulge emotions and will** (纵情任意), **encountering empty delusions and acting recklessly** (触徒妄作), their actions are **inappropriate** (所为失当), hence **humans punish and ghosts harm** (人诛鬼害), which is why it is said to be **calamitous** (凶也).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: Those who **do not know the nature of cultivation and returning to virtue** (不知性修反德), and **do not align with the true, constant Dao** (而会於真常之道者), then **give rise to delusive thoughts** (则起妄心), **follow phenomena to create karma** (随境造业), and **move toward the path of death** (动之死地), so all their actions are **calamitous** (所作皆凶也). This is the **third demonstration**, entering from the small to the great, **wondrously resonating with the void and subtlety** (妙契虚玄).\n\n**Yù’s Annotation**: **Knowing constancy** (知守真常) makes the **heart and circumstances empty and still** (则心境虚静), like **a secluded valley** (如彼空谷), **containing all without exclusion** (无不含容也).\n\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明), and **clarity** (明) means **discerning things** (则鉴物). When things come, they **must respond** (必应), **containing all without exclusion** (无不含容), hence it is said: **knowing constancy is containing** (故日知常日容).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: Those who **know the Dao’s perpetual practice** (能知道之所常行) **eliminate emotions and desires** (则除去情欲), and **contain all without exclusion** (无所不包容).\n\n**Yóng’s Commentary**: **Knowing constancy and penetrating the principle** (知常达理) has a **capacity equal to the void** (量等虚空), **containing all without exclusion** (无所不包), hence it is said to be **containing** (故日容也).\n\n「**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **The body solidifies with the Dao’s eternal oneness** (体凝常一道), **awakening to the duality of compliance and deviation as void** (悟违顺两空), hence one **can contain all things** (故能容物).\n**Containing is *gōng*** (容乃公).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **To embrace and respond to all things** (含容应物), **to respond without attachment** (应物无心), **having no partiality or deceit** (既无私邪), hence it is **the essence of impartiality** (故为公正也).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **One who can embrace and respond to all things** (能含容应物) **is impartial and without favor** (乃公正无私), **and thus all under heaven will follow** (无私则天下归往), **which is called *wáng*** (是谓王矣).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Without failing to contain anything** (无不包容), **one attains impartiality and lacks favor** (则公正无私), **and no malevolent force can withstand** (众邪莫当也).\n**Yóng** says: **Impartial without favor** (正而无私).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: *Gōng* means **levelness** (平也). **Since one can embrace all things** (既能包容庶物), **thus one attains impartiality and lacks favor** (所以公正无私). **Impartiality is *wáng*** (公乃王).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **Those who are impartial and lack favor** (能公正无私者), **will be followed by all things** (则为物所归往).\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Impartial and without favor** (公正无私), **one can rule all under heaven** (则可为天下王). **To govern oneself with rectitude** (治身正) **is to unify the form** (则形一), **and to illuminate one’s spirit** (神明千万), **all harmoniously resonating within oneself** (共奏己躬).\n**Yóng** says: **Partiality cannot harmonize with things** (偏私不堪宰物), **but impartiality can preside over all** (公正可以君临也).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: *Wáng* means **to follow** (往也). **Because one encompasses all things** (只为包含万物), **being impartial and without favor** (公正无私), **thus one becomes the Great Law King** (所以作大法王) **whom all under heaven follow** (为苍生之所归往). **The King is *Dào*** (王乃天).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **All things joyfully submit** (群物乐推), **like Heaven’s universal coverage** (如天之覆), **thus one’s virtue aligns with Heaven** (则与天合德也).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The King’s virtue aligns with Heaven** (王德如天), **thus one acts without contrivance yet all things are in order** (则无为而理), **and the Dao’s transformation is set in motion** (道化乃行), hence it is said: **the King is *Dào*** (故云王乃天).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **The King can harmonize virtue with the spirit** (王能德合神明), **thus one is in communion with Heaven** (乃与天通也).\n**Yóng** says: **Universal coverage without attachment** (无心广覆), **operating in accordance with the seasons** (运行以时).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Having already become the Great Law King** (既作法王), **encompassing all sentient beings** (化主), **and being followed by all things** (为物所归), **one further shelters and covers all sentient life** (复荫覆含灵), **in equality with the boundless Heaven** (同於昊昊). **Heaven is *Dào*** (天乃道).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The King’s virtue mirrors Heaven** (王德如天), **thus one can practice the Dao** (乃能行道).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The virtue of the King aligns with Heaven** (王德合天), **thus one can endure the Dao’s course** (则久享福祚), **and the people of all under heaven gather toward it like the sun** (天下之人就之如日), **revere it like Heaven** (戴之如天), **benefit from it like rain** (泽之如雨), **and anticipate it like spring** (望之如春). **Then until one’s death** (则终殁其身), **what peril or danger remains?** (复何危殆之事？) Hence it is said: **to die is not to perish** (故云殁身不殆).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **To be in harmony with the Dao** (与道合同), **thus one can endure long** (乃能长久).\n**Yóng** says: **The Dao endures eternally from antiquity** (道则自古以固存), **and the Sage enjoys boundless, timeless life** (圣则永享无期寿也).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **The measure equals the Great Emptiness** (量等太虚), **with neither coming nor going** (无来无去). **The heart merges with the Supreme Dao** (心冥至道), **neither annihilated nor born** (不灭不生). **Since this aligns with the above** (既与此相符), **hence it is said to be enduring** (故义说为久). **To die is not to perish** (殁身不殆).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **To act in accordance with Heaven’s Dao** (同天行道), **then even at one’s final moment** (则终殁其身), **there is no peril or danger** (长无危殆之事矣).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **One who can be impartial and a King** (能公能王), **united with Heaven and the Dao** (通天合道), **refined in purity and vast in virtue** (四者纯俗), **with Dao and virtue ever expansive** (道德弘远), **suffers no calamity or blame** (无殃无咎), **and perishes with Heaven and Earth** (与天地俱没), **yet remains unthreatened** (而不危殆也).\n\n**Yóng** says: **To perish is to reach one’s end** (没，终也). **To align with Heaven is to endure** (与天为期), **and to harmonize with the Dao is to last** (与道同久), **thus one’s finality is within this very body** (终於此身), **forever free from peril or danger** (永无危殆).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **To perish means to vanish without trace** (没，灭也). **To not perish means to be without danger** (殆，危也). **To hide one’s essence and erase one’s form** (匿端灭迹) **is called to perish within the body** (谓之没身). **To respond to sensations and act in accordance with circumstances** (应感赴机) **is called to not perish** (谓之不殆).\n**Alternative Explanation**: **The form has rise and fall** (迹有兴废), hence it is said **to perish within the body** (故言没身). **The essence is without birth or death** (本无生灭), hence it is said **to not perish** (故言不殆).\n\n**End of Volume Four of

and Xīhuá Fǎshī Chéng Xuānyīng’s Exegesis, compiled by Mángyáng Qiáng Sī** (蒙阳强思齐纂).»\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: *Dàoshàng Xià Zhī* (The Supreme Sovereign Knows Only That There Is Something Above)**\n\n**The Supreme Sovereign’s chapter follows the previous one**, for the prior chapter expounds the **Ultimate Mystery of the Dao’s profound essence**, urging all beings to begin cultivation. Thus, this chapter is placed next, revealing **the responses and transformations that follow in due course**, descending from the **root to its outward manifestations**.\n\nWithin this chapter, two distinctions are made:\n1. **The disparity in innate nature and varying levels of enlightenment**.\n2. **The sigh over the hidden operation of the Supreme Virtue**, where wisdom is yet ignorance.\n\n**1. The disparity in innate nature and varying levels of enlightenment**\nThe **Sovereign of Lu** (栗陆) and **Hèxiū** (赫胥) ruled as sovereigns in their respective ages, yet both adhered to the **Supreme Dao**, not engaging in artificial governance. Their reigns brought **peace to the Twelve Emperors**, and their glory endured for **tens of thousands of years**. The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) ruled without action or contrivance, neither above nor below knowing anything, and not entangled in affairs. The people lived like wild deer, the sovereign like a **marking branch** (标枝)—a natural symbol of leadership. The land became a **realm of the Great Dao**, and all things flourished in the **field of Huàxiū** (华胥). The **true qi** was thick and profound, their nourishment pure and harmonious; they followed the **natural inclinations of the Dao**, embodying the **uncarved simplicity of Tàipǔ** (太朴). Their lives were long, their hearts sincere—**how was this achieved?** It was truly **reliant upon the power of non-action**.\n\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is known only as something above (下知有之).\n\n**Explanation of the passage:**\nIt refers to **knowing the Supreme Sovereign above (the *dàoshàng* of the *nìhuán* 泥丸) and the lower *dàotiān* (丹田)**, where the union of *yīn* and *yáng* occurs in the *jiàngguān* (绛官). By closing the heart and grasping the essence, the **original qi** flows, and the ears perceive the **divine sounds**. When one knows the **lower abdomen’s resonance** (腹呜) and governs it with **single-mindedness**, the sounds of **bells and drums** emerge.\n\n**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **primordial ruler of antiquity**. *Xiàzhī* (下知) means that the subjects **know there is a ruler above**, revering it as the heavens, yet **without any trace of artificial governance or contrivance**, so the people **lack virtue yet still proclaim it**.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **primordial ruler of antiquity**. It is called \"Supreme\" because it is **held in highest reverence**. The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) rules through **non-action**, teaching without words. The subjects merely know that there is a ruler above, revering it as the heavens. The **Supreme Sovereign** is great and above all, **bearing the beauty of the four seasons’ nurturing**, yet the subjects **do not know how to ascribe virtue to it**, hence it is said, **\"only that there is something above\"** (下知有之).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) refers to the **nameless ruler of the Great Antiquity**. *Xiàzhī* (下知有之) means the subjects **know there is a ruler above yet do not serve it**, for their affairs are **simple, unadorned, and pure**.\n\n**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the ruler of **Supreme Virtue**. Since virtue is **ineffable** and its name is **hard to define**, it is only said that the **Great Person** (大人) is above. The passage **alludes to the Supreme Sovereign**, who **embraces the Dao and Virtue**, yet **requires nothing from below**. Below is **self-sufficient**, above **receives no tribute**. Between the sovereign and subjects, above and below, **there is only the knowing that there is something**.\n\n**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **Great Dao’s Teacher of All Beings**. The **Dao’s Sovereign** abides **above the Jade Capital** (玉京) and **within the Golden Gate** (金阙), where the mind **concentrates and drifts in boundless contemplation**, dwelling in the **eternal response**. Those with **keen innate roots**, whose **enlightenment is bright and profound**, deeply grasp the **mystery of the essence**, and their minds **concentrate yet are boundless and tranquil**. Their bodies transcend **form and name**, descending from the **root and manifesting outwardly**—thus they have a **title**, yet **do not cling to appearances**. Hence it is said, **\"only that there is something above\"** (下知有之), meaning they **know the origin of the name \"Supreme Sovereign\"**.\n\nNext, **the sovereign is beloved and praised**.\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nWhen the **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) passes away, the **Yellow Emperor**, **Yáo**, and **Shùn** emerge, **applying teachings and performing benevolence**, extending their **virtue to the common people**. Thus they are **beloved**. Their **gentle governance brings harmony**, and their **achievements surpass the world**—thus they are **praised**. This **love and praise arise from the people’s traces**, yet **such artificial governance becomes a calamity for future generations**, hence *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) says: **\"I tell you! The root of great chaos lies between the ages of Yáo and Shùn. Its end persists even a thousand generations later.\"**\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:\nTheir **virtue is visible**, their **benevolence and grace can be praised**—thus they are **beloved and praised**.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** (严君平) said:\nWhen people **delight in being sovereigns**, they are called **Emperors**.\n\n**Explanation by the *Jiéshuō* (节解):**\n**Beloved** refers to the **spirit** (魂), **praised** refers to the **shadow** (魄).\n\n**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:\nThe **ruler of lower virtue** (下德之君) **engages in contrived governance**, yet **cannot forget words**. Above, the sovereign is **trusted and revered by the subjects**; below, the sovereign is **praised by those above**.\n\n**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):\nThose of **medium innate roots**, whose **enlightenment is somewhat dim**, **cannot forget words to verify truth**, and must **grasp forms to cultivate**. Thus they **cling to scriptures and teachings**, **cherishing and praising** the sovereign in **artificial reverence**, generating **emotions through texts**, and **mutually flattering** one another.\n\nNext, **the sovereign is feared and scorned**.\n**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nWhen **virtue declines further**, the sovereign **imposes many faults in governance**, and the people **cannot endure his rule**. Then the sovereign **drives them with punishments**, hence they **fear him**. When **emotions are indulged and deceit prevails**, the sovereign **cannot discern truth**, hence they **scorn him**.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nWhen the **Yellow Emperor**, **Yáo**, and **Shùn** pass away, descending to the **Three Kings and Five Hegemons**, their governance **grows increasingly oppressive**, with **harsh laws and severe punishments**—thus they are **feared**. Their **inability to discern truth** leads to **scorn**. Below, they **accuse the guilty to seek merit**; above, they **reward the wicked to foster deceit**. Thus mutual deception arises, **causing hearts to grow cold**.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:\nNext, **they fear him**, establishing **laws and punishments to govern them**. **They scorn him**, for his **many prohibitions and burdensome decrees** cannot **inspire sincere allegiance**, hence they **deceive and scorn him**.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** (严君平) said:\n**Sighing and lamenting**, he is called **ruler** (王).\n\n**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:\nUnable to **follow the transformations of all things** or **trust in nature’s spontaneity**, they **establish laws and punishments to threaten them**—thus it is said, **\"feared\"**. With **many decrees and the people deceiving below**—thus it is said, **\"scorned\"**. This is the **degeneration of the ancient order**.\n\n**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):\n**Scorn** is **deceit**. Those of **low innate roots**, whose **nature is dull and emotions unbridled**, **indulge their hearts in sensory pursuits**, growing **ever more entangled**. They **fear only worldly punishments**, not the **retribution of the netherworld**, hence they **deceive and scorn the sacred words**, **defaming and rejecting them**. Thus the *Dàodé Jīng* (道德经) says: **\"The petty scholar hears the Dao and laughs at it.\"**\n\n**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThose who **fear and scorn the sovereign** arise **from the sovereign’s lack of trustworthiness**, hence the people below **also have those who do not believe**.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThis **reverses the explanation of \"fear and scorn\"** (畏之侮之).\n\n「The common folk fear the sovereign’s teachings and decrees, all because the sovereign’s trustworthiness is insufficient among them, hence the people below also come to have such unfaithful ones.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: *\"Insufficient trustworthiness\"* means the sovereign lacks trustworthiness among the people below, so the people below then have clever and deceitful subjects. *\"There are those who do not believe\"* means the people below respond with disbelief and deceive their sovereign.\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: As the ruler above, one should **transform** (化) them with the **Dao/Way**; one should **demonstrate** (示) trustworthiness. If the ruler can trust the people below, the people below will also trust the ruler. If the ruler can trust the people below, the people below will also trust the ruler above.\n\n○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): Precisely because the people below are burdened by **innate roots** (机) and **trustworthy roots** (信根) are insufficient, they doubt and defame the sacred texts, incurring the crime of disbelief. Hence, the **Dao/Way** is held in contempt.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): *\"To honor and praise\"* (亲之誉之) refers to the sovereign having words of **virtue/power** (德) and teaching (教), hence the people honor and praise his words.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): This **reverses the explanation** of *\"to honor and praise\"* (亲之誉之也). The common folk thus honor and love the sovereign’s benevolence and goodness, and praise the sovereign’s accomplishments and deeds, because the sovereign has words of **virtue/power** (德教) and teaching (教), hence they hold his words in high regard and praise them.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: When the **Sovereign of the Highest** (太上之君) undertakes actions, they are still held in high regard as words. This is to **fear departing from the Dao/Way** and losing **naturalness** (自然).\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: This refers to the time of antiquity (中古之时), when one had not yet forgotten words (未能忘言). Words were borrowed to convey meaning, and mutual honor and praise were given. Hence, words were emphasized.\n\n○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): The false and superficial words of the worldly (世俗浮伪之言) are why they do not know the **true and real teachings** (至道真实之教) of the **Dao/Way**. Thus, confusion and delusion grow deeper with time, and their **karmic obstacles** (罪障) increase.\n\n**Second sigh:** The **highest virtue/power** (至德) is hidden and unmanifest, yet the people remain unaware in their daily lives. When accomplishments are fulfilled and undertakings completed, the common folk say, *\"The Sovereign of the Highest acts naturally.\"*\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): When accomplishments are fulfilled yet the ruler does not cling to them, and undertakings are completed yet the ruler takes no action, the common folk live their daily lives unaware, saying, *\"The Sovereign of the Highest naturally achieves and fulfills this.\"* Then, the **Sovereign of the Highest** remains unknown below.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): This **reverses the explanation** of *\"the Sovereign of the Highest remains unknown below\"* (太上下知也). If the **Dao/Way** is pure and uncorrupted (淳朴不残), who would make the **sacrificial offerings** (牺樽)? If the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (道德) are universally practiced (公行), why would there be any need for honor and praise (亲誉焉设)? Hence, in the age of the **Sovereign of the Highest**, the people below forget the **imperial force** (帝力), and only when accomplishments are fulfilled and undertakings completed do the common folk regard it as natural and fitting, unaware of why they honor and praise benevolence and kindness.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: *\"Accomplishments fulfilled and undertakings completed\"* refers to the **Great Peace** (太平) of the world. *\"The common folk say, 'The Sovereign of the Highest acts naturally'\"*—the common folk do not know that the sovereign above possesses **pure and profound virtue/power** (德淳厚), instead believing it is their own natural course.\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: The **imperial Dao/Way** (帝皇之道) is to **achieve great accomplishments** (隆功成). The **wind of non-action** (无为之风) is to **complete undertakings** (着事遂). Earlier, the three ancient stages were explained: the **Dao/Way** was lost, and **virtue/power** declined, from **pure antiquity** (淳) to **corrupted later times** (浇), then again returning to **pure antiquity** (淳). The **Dao/Way** is shallow and easily seen, while **virtue/power** is high and difficult to perceive. Now that the **sacred transformation** (圣化) is profound and the **divine accomplishments** (神功) are unfathomable, the people remain unaware in their daily lives, saying it is natural. Hence, *\"the Sovereign of the Highest remains unknown below.\"*\n\n○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): The **accomplishments of the Dao/Way** (亭毒之功成) and the **fulfillment of nurturing life** (生育之事遂) are such that the **highest virtue/power** (至德) remains hidden, yet the ruler does not claim credit for the success. Thus, the common folk live their daily lives unaware, saying, *\"The Sovereign of the Highest naturally attains such things,\"* without knowing they should **rely upon the sacred grace** (荷圣恩).\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao/Way is Abandoned**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which explained how **Dao/Way** manifests from its **original root** (本) and descends into **traces** (迹), adapting to circumstances (随机). Hence, this chapter follows to clarify that once the **traces** (迹) are established, the **mysterious root** (妙本) is concealed.\n\nWithin this chapter, there are three layers of meaning:\n1. It explains that when the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) then appear.\n2. It explains that using **wisdom** (智) to govern things is the **source of artifice and deceit** (娇诈之源).\n3. It distinguishes how **loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝) arise due to **disorder** (为乱).\n\n**First layer:** When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) then appear.\n\nThe **Five Emperors** (五帝) were pure and flowing (淳流), while the **Three Kings** (三王) were **corrupted and competitive** (浇竞). Because the **Dao/Way of knotted cords** (结绳道) was abandoned and **martial affairs** (干戈事) arose, **Yīn** (殷) then practiced **sacrificial offerings** with **sliced hearts** (赤血剖心), and **Zhōu** (周) used **white flags** (白旗) to **display severed heads** (枭首). When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) is abandoned, the world falls into disorder (崩离). **Wú and Yuè** (吴越) perished through **conquest and slaughter** (伐国亡躯), while **Zhī Chéng** (之呛) lost his life through **surrendering power** (禅权绝命). The meaning of losing the **Dao/Way** is evident here.\n\nThus, it is known that the **sacred governance** (圣治) has no **action** (为), and the **mysterious wind** (玄风) of the **Dao/Way** (道) is ever-present (长扇). Even **straw dogs** (刍狗) and all things are not **cherished as one’s own** (不亲其亲), yet the ruler **accepts offerings from the common folk** (纳惶) in fear, and **comforts the suffering masses** (吊百姓之涂炭). They speak of *\"joy\"* (乐) and *\"joy\"* (乐), yet why do they use **bells and drums** (锺鼓)? They speak of *\"rites\"* (礼) and *\"rites\"* (礼), yet the **elaborate funerals** (雕丧) are such as these. When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) is abandoned, there is **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义).\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): When **purity is dispersed** (浇淳) and **simplicity is lost** (散朴), the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail. Daily, **benevolence** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) arise, yet they are but small accomplishments (小成遂作). The **moist and weak** (濡沬) stem from insufficiency, while **decay and exhaustion** (凋弊) arise from **action** (有为). Yet the **sage’s intent** (圣人救伐之心) is never different; the **traces of leveling and smoothing** (夷险之迹) cannot be unified.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): The **Great Dao/Way** (大道) refers to the time when **purity was dispersed** (浇漓) and **simplicity was lost** (散朴). The **mysterious wind** (玄晏之风) of the **Dao/Way** (道) is extinguished, and the **tranquil transformation** (穆清之化) does not exist. They have lost the **highest virtue/power** (至道) of **non-action** (无为), hence it is said to be abandoned. When abandoned, there arises **compassionate love** (兼爱) as **benevolence** (仁) and **judging what is wrong** (裁非) as **righteousness** (义). Thus, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) are interspersed among them. Hence, *Zhuāngzi* (《庄子》) says: *\"The Dao/Way is hidden in small accomplishments.\"* It means that **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) and others each achieve their own ends, yet cannot **greatly harmonize** (大通), hence they are called *small accomplishments* (小成).\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: In the time of the **Great Dao/Way** (大道之时), **filial piety** (孝) was found in every household, and **loyalty** (忠) was found in every state. Thus, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) were not seen. When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) was abandoned and **evil and perversity** (恶逆) arose, then **transformations of righteousness** (化义) emerged, yet the **Dao/Way** was not transmitted.\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: In the realm of **Emphasizing the Mysterious** (重玄), the **phenomena of qi** (气象) cannot be shifted, and in the **principle of utmost emptiness** (至虚之理), the **void** (空) is not yet worth discussing. If one cannot **respond and adapt** (迎随), what is the **beginning** (始) or **end** (终)? If there is no **change in flourishing and decline** (盛衰无变), what is **arising** (兴) or **abandoning** (废)? On the day of **purity and simplicity** (纯粹之日), there is no separation between **near and far, states and families** (彼此不隔、州、亲疏). In the time of **tranquility and peace** (静泰之辰), there is no distinction between **high and low, noble and ignoble** (上下不彰於贵贱). The **natural harmony** (自然符会) occurs without need for **knotted cords** (结绳). One treads upon the **Great Square** (大方), needing no **written contracts** (书契). When the **true time** (真时) reaches **oneness** (至一), it is said that the **Dao/Way** arises. When one practices **partial love** (偏爱) as **benevolence** (仁) and **judges wrongness** (裁非) as **righteousness** (义), the **corruption and shallowness** (浇薄) begin, and they cannot practice the **Dao/Way** (道), hence it is said that the **Dao/Way** is abandoned.\n\nThe times shift between **corruption and purity** (浇淳), yet the **Dao/Way** knows no rise or fall (道无兴废).\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** This is when the **Supreme Sovereign’s Teaching** (太上之教) is abandoned.\nIt is said that in the **Age of Great Dao**, the **Five Virtues** (五德) are not manifest, and when **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) arise, **purity and simplicity** (淳朴) are lost. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Dispersing virtue and power into benevolence and righteousness is the crime of the sages.\"* Again, it says: *\"Mutual moistening in conversation is not as good as mutual forgetting in the rivers and lakes.\"* The second point clarifies that **governing through wisdom** (以智治物) is the source of **artifice and deceit** (矫诈). When **wisdom and insight** (智惠) emerge, **great falsehood** (大伪) follows.\n○ **御注:** Those who employ **wisdom and insight** (智惠) are about to establish laws (将立法也). When laws are enacted, deceit arises, and thus **great falsehood** emerges. Even **sealing official seals** (窃符玺) cannot be trusted.\n○ **御疏:** When **wisdom** (智慧) emerges, it refers to later generations using wisdom to legislate, establishing laws to curb the people and decrees to punish deceit. Fearing disbelief, they create **seals and insignia** (符玺) to authenticate them. Fearing injustice, they use **measuring tools** (斗斛) to quantify. Yet, the unvirtuous steal seals and measuring tools, undermining the original intent of wisdom’s laws. Thus, wisdom’s governance only magnifies deceit, hence it is said that **great falsehood** arises.\n○ **River Master (河上公) says:** The **wise ruler** (智慧之君) devalues **virtue** (德) and prizes **words** (言), devalues **substance** (质) and prizes **ornament** (文). The people respond in kind, and this becomes the root of **great falsehood and deceit** (大伪奸诈).\n○ **Honor’s Commentary (荣曰):** **Dim and silent** (昏昏默默) is the **ultimate of the Dao**. **Obscure and murky** (昧昧晦晦) is the **peak of practice** (行之至). Unable to shine without dazzling, they abandon **knowledge and convention** (去知与故), adorn **wisdom** (饰智慧) to astonish the simple, and vie in **right and wrong** (竞是非) to lead the masses. When **right and wrong** alternate endlessly, **deceit and cunning** multiply. **Thieves and bandits** (盗跖) tread this as the **Dao**, while **ambitious ministers** (田成) exploit it to usurp the state—this is **great falsehood**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** **Wisdom** (智慧) here refers to **sagely wisdom** (圣智). When the **sage governs through wisdom**, laws and decrees proliferate, and the people respond with countless deceits to evade punishment. They even steal the **sage’s wisdom** as tools for falsehood—**wisdom’s harm** is fully revealed in *Zhuangzi’s* text.\n\nThe third point distinguishes the **arising of loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝之兴) as the cause of **chaos** (因乎为乱). When **six kinships** (六亲) are not harmonious, **filial piety and kindness** (孝慈) emerge.\n○ **御注:** Father, son, husband, wife, brothers—these are the **six kinships** (六亲). When **kinship and affinity lack order** (疏戚无伦), they are not harmonious (不和). Each clings to their own kin and children, and thus **filial piety and kindness** arise. All stem from abandoning the **Dao**, hence these **partial names** emerge.\n○ **御疏:** The **six kinships** (六亲) are father, son, brothers, and spouses. In the **Age of Great Harmony**, there is no selfish kinship. When **superior and inferior** become discordant, **grievances and favors** arise, leading to **pillow-warming and blanket-sharing**, which people call **filial piety**. Covering when entering, shielding when exiting, which people call **kindness**. Though adorned with the names of **filial piety and kindness**, they bear the air of **self-aggrandizement**, unaware that in the **Age of Great Dao**, the world is a single household, with the **sovereign supporting above and soothing below**—a natural order. To view others as oneself, not just loving one’s own kin, then **all under heaven may be filial**. If others treat you as oneself, not just cherishing one’s own children, then **all under heaven may be kind**. Thus, where do the names of **filial piety and kindness** apply?\n○ **River Master (河上公) says:** When the **six bonds of kinship** (六纪) are severed and **kinsfolk are discordant**, then **filial piety and kindness** arise to nurture one another.\n○ **Honor’s Commentary (荣曰):** Father, son, brothers, and spouses—these are the **six kinships**. When distinctions blur, **right and wrong cease**, yet **long and short** contrast, giving rise to **likes and dislikes**. Harmony is marked by **disharmony**, and **filial piety** is established through **ingratitude**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** The **six kinships** are father, son, brothers, and spouses. In an age of **pure harmony**, partial love is not yet manifest. When the **six bonds of kinship** (六纪) are disordered, **filial piety and kindness** take form. Thus, when **Zhou’s virtue declined**, **corruption and competition** surged, leading to **Zengzi and Min’s** exalted **filial piety** as a display of virtue.\nWhen a state is **in chaos and darkness**, **loyal ministers** (忠臣) arise.\n○ **御注:** In times of **great peace**, all are self-sufficient—what need is there for such names?\n\nThe days of chaos and darkness see **loyal ministers** risking their lives to save their lord—then **loyal ministers** arise.\n\n○ **御疏:** Loyalty is the duty of a subject, yet why speak of **\"loyal ministers\"**? It is because the ruler fails to govern his ministers properly, allowing flatterers to advance, to serve a **corrupt lord**, and thus bring about calamity. Then those who see danger and risk death to rescue the state earn the name **\"loyal ministers.\"**\nWhen the **Dao/Way** flourishes in its purity, with **non-action** and tranquility, the multitude of **noble worthies** are all **Qí-Lóng**—virtuous and sagely—with **proper relationships** in order, and none but **natural conduct**. Only then do the names **\"loyalty\"** and **\"filial piety\"** fade, and the **pure and unadorned Dao/Way** prevail. What need then for **\"loyal ministers\"**?\nThese four are the extreme of decline—how could they not return to **purity and simplicity**?\n\n○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** When **governance fails**, the ruler and subjects blame each other, and **wicked schemers** vie for power—then **\"loyal ministers\"** arise to rescue their lord.\nThis shows that in a world of **great peace**, none know **benevolence**; when all desires vanish, none know **tranquility**; when all act purely for themselves, none know **integrity**.\nIn the **Age of the Great Dao/Way**, **benevolence and righteousness** fade, **filial piety and kindness** vanish—just as at high noon, the sun’s brilliance obscures the stars.\n\n○ **Master Róng (荣) says:** In the time of **Xī and Nóng**, no need was heard of **supporting ministers**; in the days of **Jié and Zhòu**, only then were **loyal ministers** like **Guān Yǔ and Bǐ Gān** praised.\nThus, when the sun shines brightly in the sky, the stars cannot compete in their radiance; when the timely rains fall, the irrigation channels cannot claim their merit. If the lord is **corrupt above** and the ministers **rebellious below**, yet one arises to **support the lord internally** and **pacify external threats**, then the name **\"loyal minister\"** shines forth.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** A **sovereign of a great state** rules over the **Four Seas** as his domain. Thus, in times of **perfect governance**, **loyalty** is unseen; in times of **chaos**, **virtuous integrity** becomes manifest. Hence, **Lóng Fēng** was renowned in **Xià Jié’s** reign, and **Bǐ Gān** was praised in **Shāng Zhòu’s** time.\n\n---\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**\nThis chapter follows the previous because the last spoke of the **Great Dao/Way** having declined, and thus **sages and wise men** arose. Hence, this chapter urges **discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom**, returning to the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nNow, dividing the meaning of this chapter into three parts:\n1. **First**, it clarifies that **discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom** brings **great benefits**, to guide beginners.\n2. **Second**, it laments that the **Great Vehicle** cannot be grasped by inferior capacities.\n3. **Third**, it briefly opens the essential gate, guiding beginners onward.\n\n---\n**1. First, it clarifies that discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom brings great benefits, to guide beginners.**\n\nA **ruler who embraces the Dao/Way**, concentrating his mind in inward illumination, then **his body aligns with the earth’s vastness** and **nurtures all**, his **virtue/power** is **round and luminous**, **pure and clear**. He **transcends the dust of the ages**, **serene in the world’s subtlety**, **free from worldly wisdom**, and **acts beyond conventional thought**.\nLike **Yáo**, his virtue **spreads universally beneath Heaven**; like **Shùn**, his **virtue/power** flows **unobstructed across the land**. Then all things **fulfill their nature in the Dao/Way**, and affairs **rest in the True**. Thus, **artifice and deceit vanish from human conduct**, and **loyalty and filial piety** return to **natural inclination**.\nTo **practice these three**, one finds **self-sufficiency**—why seek the **four limbs of knowledge** or **many learned words**? **\"Seeing the unadorned\"** requires **little thought**; this is a **later warning**.\n\n**Discarding the sage, abandoning wisdom—**\nthe people’s benefit is **a hundredfold**.\n\n○ **御注:** **Discarding the sage’s** teachings and traces, then **transformation rests in non-action**. **Abandoning worldly wisdom’s** deceit, then **people return to purity and simplicity**. **Purity and simplicity** mean **artifice and deceit do not arise**; **non-action** means **self-aggrandizement is not practiced**.\nWhen **heaven and humanity** are in harmony, and **all things lose not their nature**, then the people enjoy **a hundredfold benefit**.\n\n○ **御疏:** **\"Sage\"** refers to those who **craft and create**; **\"wisdom\"** refers to **worldly cunning and deceit**. The **sage’s craft** leaves traces, and **worldly wisdom** is not true.\nLosing **truth** gives rise to **artifice and deceit**; following **traces** leads to **losing the root**. Thus, both must be **discarded and abandoned** to preserve **purity and simplicity**.\nWhen **heavenly harmony** flows freely and **self-aggrandizement** ceases, the people gain **a hundredfold benefit**.\n\n○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** **\"Discarding the sage\"** means **rejecting crafted institutions**, returning to **primordial simplicity**. The **Five Emperors** drew symbols, **Cāng Jié** invented writing—yet this is inferior to the **Three Sovereigns’** **knotted cords without script**.\n**\"Abandoning wisdom\"** means **rejecting clever stratagems**, returning to **non-action**. The people’s benefit is **a hundredfold**: **agriculture flourishes**, and **public and private** are **unified**.\n\n○ **Master Róng (荣) says:** **\"Sage\"** is what the **common mind** reveres; **\"wisdom\"** is what the **foolish seek**. Without **wisdom**, how could one **discern circumstances**? Without the **sage**, how could one **govern affairs**? Yet now it is said to **discard and abandon**—this is unheard of.\nWhen the **sage arises**, **thieves multiply**; when **wisdom is used**, **bandits appear**. Now it is said to **discard**—then **thieves and bandits do not rise**. The benefit is indeed **great**; briefly, it is **a hundredfold**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** **Discarding** the **named sage**, **abandoning** **discriminating wisdom**, all return to their **roots**—the benefit is **extremely great**. Speaking of **\"a hundredfold\"** is but **taking the greater number**.\nThus, *Zhuāngzǐ* says: **\"Rú wine is thin, Hán Dān is besieged—when the sage appears, great thieves arise.\"**\nAgain, **Tián Chéngzǐ**, with his **sage-like wisdom**, **seized the state of Qí**—such are the examples.\n\n---\n**Discarding benevolence, abandoning righteousness—**\nthe people **return to filial piety and kindness**.\n\n○ **御注:** **Discarding** the **benevolence of universal love**, **abandoning** the **righteousness of judging right and wrong**, then the people **return to great filial piety and kindness**.\n\n○ **御疏:** The previous chapter spoke of the **Great Dao/Way’s** decline and the rise of **benevolence and righteousness**. Now it says to **discard benevolence and abandon righteousness**, yet the people **return to filial piety and kindness**, showing that in the **age of the Great Dao/Way**, **\"mystical unity\"** prevailed—**no private kin existed**, all were **kind and filial**.\nThus, when **principles are perfect**, **traces vanish**; when **affairs are right**, **names fade**.\nNow, when the **six bonds of kinship** are **broken**, then the **names of filial piety and kindness** shine forth. If **universal love** is **discarded** and **judging righteousness** is **abandoned**, then **no stains of partiality remain in the rivers and lakes**, and **filial kindness** rests in **natural substance**. Thus, the people **return to great filial piety and kindness**.\n\n○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** **\"Discarding benevolence\"** means **rejecting the kindness of benevolence**; **\"abandoning righteousness\"** means **rejecting the superficiality of righteousness**.\n\nThe people **return to filial piety and kindness**, for **virtue/power** and **cultivation** are pure and simple.\n\n○ **Honor** says: **Benevolence** loves all things, **righteousness** yields to others—though these are daily **principles for nurturing humanity**, they are also **artificial corrections of human nature**. Now, **discarding** such **artificial benevolence and righteousness**, we **return to innate filial piety and kindness**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Rejecting** the **one-sided emphasis of benevolence**, **abandoning** the **obstinate adherence to righteousness**, all act in accordance with their **true nature**, without **artifice or pretense**. Filial piety arises from **heavenly principle**, kindness flows from **natural substance**. Thus, they **revert to ancient simplicity**, and it is said the people **return**.\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Benevolence and righteousness are the thatched huts of ancient kings, already discarded like old dog-food.\"* Again: *\"If you eliminate the conduct of the historians Zeng and Shi, all will be benevolent.\"* **Discarding skill and abandoning gain**, thieves and robbers **will not exist**.\n\n○ **Official Annotation**: People **boast of their partial talents**, each harboring **contention for profit**, so **discarding skill** means **no contention**, **abandoning gain** means **self-sufficiency**—sufficiency **prevents theft and robbery**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Discarding skill** means **rejecting false, excessive, and licentious craft**. **Abandoning gain** means **rejecting greed, monopolies, and exploitation**. Thieves and robbers arise from **covetousness and insufficiency**; now, **discarding skill** removes contention, **abandoning gain** ensures sufficiency—**who would then become thieves or robbers?** Hence, it is said **none exist**.\n\n○ **River Above Master** says: **Discarding skill**—**deception and falsity corrupt truth**. **Abandoning gain**—**blocking the path to wealth, closing the gates of power**. Thieves and robbers **will not exist**; above, **virtue/power** is **public and just**, below, **no deceit or private gain remains**.\n\n○ **Honor** says: **Severing the artisan Ku’s fingers**, **quelling the scheming mind**—this is **discarding skill**. **Destroying jade and shattering pearls**—this is **abandoning gain**. But thieves act **for gain**; if treasures yield **no profit**, who would steal?\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Rejecting perverse skill**, **abandoning acquisitive gain**, all **abide by their proper measure**—thus, **no plundering occurs**. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"In the time of Shennong, skilled artisans’ fingers were severed—all were then skilled.\"* **This is a general lament for the Great Vehicle’s inability to awaken lower capacities.**\n\nThese three principles **are insufficient as doctrine alone**, so **they are followed by further guidance**.\n\n○ **Official Annotation**: These three **must be discarded**, yet **no method of cultivation is shown**—thus, the text is **insufficient as teaching**, and **further guidance is provided below**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: The three refer to:\n1. **Discarding the Sage and abandoning wisdom**,\n2. **Discarding benevolence and abandoning righteousness**,\n3. **Discarding skill and abandoning gain**.\n\nThough these three **are insufficient as doctrine**, the **four practices below** **exceed in self-cultivation**. To **restrain evil at its root**, one must **draw from inner conduct**.\n\n○ **River Above Master** says: **\"Seeing true simplicity, embracing natural purity\"**—**seeing true simplicity** means **holding to simplicity and truth, rejecting artificial adornment**. **Embracing natural purity** means **embracing genuine simplicity to guide others, making it worthy of emulation**. **\"Few private desires, scant covetousness\"**—**know contentment**.\n\n○ **Honor** says: **Purity** is **origin**—**untainted by the myriad phenomena**. **Embracing unity without deviation**—this is **embracing purity**. **Impartial without favor**—this is **few private desires**. **Guiding emotion by nature**—this is **scant covetousness**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Seeing true simplicity**—**removing artificiality**. **Embracing natural purity**—**returning to reality**. **Few private desires**—**public justice**. **Scant covetousness**—**avoiding greed**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty: The Chapter on Discarding Learning**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter **discarded Sage-wisdom to eliminate entanglements**, and this chapter **addresses cause and effect**—since **causes produce results**, it follows accordingly.\n\nThis chapter is divided into five sections:\n1. **Exhorting to discard learning**, showing **no distinction between good and evil**,\n2. **Pointing out illusory dust that should not be indulged**,\n3. **Enumerating the states of beings indulging in such dust**,\n4. **Contrasting the Sage’s enlightenment with the vulgar’s delusion**,\n5. **Exclusively revealing the Sage’s partial use of the Dao**.\n\n---\n**First Section: Exhorting to Discard Learning, Showing No Distinction Between Good and Evil**\n\nWithin the **uppermost realm of alchemical refinement**, in the **secret domain of profound techniques**, **true speech** resounds **faintly**, preserved in the **jewelry vaults of eternity**. **Immortal hymns** chime **crystal-clear**, radiating from **golden scriptures** in **distant brilliance**. **Treasure is stored therein**; perhaps the **myriad scrolls** remain **sealed long**, like **autumn waters flowing freely** or **spring platforms left untouched**.\n\n**Discarding the learning of artificial doing**, one **settles into inner truth**. Facing **good and evil alike**, one **forgets both**; **comprehending the One**, one **transcends duality**. How could one **pursue human affairs**, **driven by defilements**, **spreading like weeds in the vulgar world**, **lingering in the realms of Zheng and Wei**? The **Great Sage** **decays from this**, hence **discards and departs**.\n\n**Ceasing Learning Brings Peace**\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\nTo abandon the artificial learning of the vulgar world, one preserves the purity of nature undisturbed. With few desires and little selfishness, one attains true rest and freedom from care.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThose who cease learning do so by abandoning the artificial learning of the vulgar world. All humans are born with an innate purity. The more one exceeds natural limits in pursuit of learning, the more one harms this purity. If one completely ceases all action, one would leave all things unrefined. But here, it is only the excessive, artificial learning—what Zhuangzi called *vulgar learning*—that must be abandoned to return to one’s original state. As for the learning inherent to one’s nature, the superior person cultivates it diligently through action; this is not the same as ceasing learning. Thus, it is said: *Ceasing learning brings peace.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nCeasing learning does not mean abandoning true learning; it means removing superficiality, thus attaining peace and rest.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nVulgar learning teaches one to value trifling distinctions, to know the customs of social gatherings and partisan debates. The virtuous benefit from it, but the wicked are harmed by it. Since virtuous people are few and the wicked many within the world, the benefits of learning are shallow while its harms are deep. When the wicked engage in learning, it is like a tiger gaining wings—soaring over the four seas, selecting flesh to devour. The Sage rejects this, and thus the world rests in peace, transforming without instruction and submitting without command.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nIf one’s aspiration is the Dao of non-action, then there is no need for learning. Blending the wise and foolish, one does not hear of gain or loss. In advancing or retreating, one remains in forgetfulness, unaffected by praise or blame. Embracing the natural Way, how could there be any care?\n\nThose who cling to artificial pursuits learn not for themselves but for external gain—straining their heads and piercing their thighs to compete for fame, studying by candlelight to contend for profit. They fear that their reputation will not stand, that their gains will not come, and thus anxiety arises.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Worry\"* means burdensome cares. To abandon learning rooted in artificial distinctions and merge with the principle of non-action is to exhaust all burdens, hence there is no worry.\n\nHow far apart are *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"*? How different are *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"*?\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\n*\"Yes\"* is a respectful response; *\"agree\"* is a careless one. Though both emerge from the mouth, one is said to be close. A respectful response is good, while a careless one is evil. This illustrates that ceasing vulgar learning brings peace, while failing to do so breeds suffering—all depending on the mind’s reflection. How could the distance be great?\n\n**Exegesis:**\n*\"Yes\"* means to respond appropriately. The *Rites* say: *\"When the master summons, do not answer with ‘yes’ before rising.\"*\n\n*\"Agree\"* is a careless response. The *Book of Han* says: *\"Who dares to question?\"*—meaning, *\"Who dares to ask?\"* This is an illustrative analogy. Though *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* both come from the mouth, one is respectful and good, the other careless and evil. If learning is not abandoned, the fault lies in the mind; but if abandoned, there is no worry—only if neglected does suffering arise. Since both emerge from the mouth, they are said to be close. But the distinction lies in the heart, hence the question: *How far apart are they?*\n\nIf one realizes that learning and non-learning are both empty, that all distinctions are void, and forgets knowing in knowing, then *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* become equal, and good and evil are both forgotten.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"Yes\"* and *\"agree\"* are both responses, yet how close they are—how the times despise substance while valuing form. Good and evil—how different they are! The good are praised, the evil are reproached. How far apart can they be? Does the age despise the honest and honor the flatterer?\n\n**Master Rong says:**\n*\"Yes\"* is the proper response in ritual; *\"agree\"* is the informal reply. What aligns with the heart is good; what contradicts it is evil. *\"How close\"* means the distance is not great. To embody the Dao is to dispel all concerns; to follow nature is to find all paths suitable. In truth, there is neither opposition nor compliance, neither beauty nor ugliness. Yet artificial distinctions force separation, giving rise to partiality and delusion. One clings to trivialities, neglecting the realm of virtue and morality, demanding only superficial propriety. If it pleases the heart, it is called *\"right,\"* regardless of wisdom or folly. If it flatters oneself, it is called *\"able,\"* without regard for intelligence or ignorance. Thus, the wise become as foolish as the unwise, and the virtuous as base as the wicked. Hence, it is said: *\"How close they are.\"*\n\nIt is also said that human nature is inherently fixed. To nurture it excessively leads to loss, to advance intelligence for empty praise, to adorn deceit for wicked deeds—*\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* differ only slightly, hence *\"how close they are.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Yes\"* is a respectful affirmation; *\"agree\"* is a careless response. The *Rites* state: *\"When the master summons, do not answer with ‘yes.’\"* *\"How close\"* means they are not distant. People fail to grasp the distinction between compliance and defiance, recklessly generating joy or anger. Hearing *\"yes\"* is deemed good, hearing *\"agree\"* provokes anger, unaware that both sounds issue from the same mouth and are not truly distant. Thus, it is said: *\"How close they are.\"*\n\nGood and evil—how different they are! What aligns with intention is good; what defies it is evil. Once compliance and defiance are seen as empty, where do good and evil reside? Moreover, *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* arise from one mouth, while good and evil stem from one heart. Those who forget know their indistinguishability, while those who cling are as divided as Chu and Yue. Yet those ensnared by artificial learning are many, and within the mix of right and wrong, joy and anger, *\"yes\"* and *\"agree,\"* lies the root of all suffering. This is why abandoning it brings peace—these pairs merely illustrate the need to abandon clinging to learning.\n\n**The Second Point: Do Not Dwell in the Dust of Delusion**\nWhat people fear, one must truly fear.\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\nWhat ordinary people fear is arrogance and evil. What the virtuous fear is vulgar learning and artificial doing. All must be abandoned, hence one must truly fear them.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nWhat people fear is arrogance and evil. Arrogance leads to excess; evil invites censure.\n\n「被嫌则人所弃薄，为过则物多尤怨。以况有为俗学，增长是非，若不畏而绝之，是皆违分伤性，故不可不畏而绝之也。\n\nTo be censured means to be abandoned by others; to commit faults means to invite blame from all. And yet, conventional learning and artificial pursuits only amplify distinctions of right and wrong. If one does not fear and abandon them, they all violate the Dao and harm one’s nature—thus they must truly be feared and abandoned.\n\n○河上公曰：人之所畏，人谓道人，所畏者，畏不绝学为之君也。不可不畏，近令色，杀仁贤也。\n\nRiver Shang Master said: What people fear is called \"Daoist\" (道人), for they fear that learning will become their sovereign. If not feared and abandoned, it will lead to lust and destroy virtue and wisdom.\n\n○荣曰：水火可畏，不畏必遭烧溺，豺狼可畏，不畏终遇於损伤，故知人行爱憎而不已，归兹损败，贪名利而无息，致此危亡。\n\nHonor said: Water and fire are to be feared, for failing to fear them brings certain burning and drowning. Predators are to be feared, for failing to fear them invites harm. Thus, one sees that relentless attachment to likes and dislikes leads to ruin, and insatiable greed for fame and gain brings perilous destruction.\n\n今流俗滞之有溺之忘反，莽莽欲出无期。\n\nNow, the common folk are mired in delusion, drowning in forgetfulness, yet recklessly strive to emerge without end.\n\n○成疏：学人之所畏，谓生死及诸尘也，不可不畏，叉没溺也。前绝示善恶皆空，恐滞斯文，遂染尘境，故发此句以戒之。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: What scholars fear are life and death, as well as all worldly entanglements. If not feared, they will perish in them. Earlier, it was shown that right and wrong are both empty; yet fearing stagnation in this teaching, they fall into the dust of worldly affairs—thus this sentence is issued as a warning.\n\n第三泛列众生耽染之状。荒兮其未央哉。\n\n**The Third Point: The General Condition of Sentient Beings’ Indulgence**\nHow desolate and endless it is!\n\n御注：若不畏绝俗学，则众生正性荒废，其未有央止之时。\n\nRiver Shang Master’s Commentary: If one does not fear and abandon conventional learning, then the true nature of sentient beings will be squandered, and there will be no end to their ruin.\n\n○御疏：荒，荒废也。慢恶为过，俗学失真，是皆可畏，故当弃绝。若不绝而弃之，则正性荒废，其未有央止时。《诗》曰：夜未央，言更漏尚多也。此云其未央，言俗学伤性无息止期，故前途尚多，云未央也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"Ungoverned\" (荒) means desolation. Arrogance and evil are faults; conventional learning loses its truth—these are all things to be feared, hence they must be discarded. If they are not discarded but merely abandoned, then the true nature will be squandered, and there will be no end to its ruin. The *Book of Odes* says: *\"The night knows no end\"* (夜未央), meaning the water clock still has much time to flow. Here, \"no end\" speaks of how conventional learning harms nature without cessation, so the path ahead remains boundless.\n\n○河上公曰：世俗之人荒乱，欲学为进文，未央止也。\n\nRiver Shang Master said: The common folk are chaotic and reckless, striving to learn for advancement, yet there is no end to their striving.\n\n○成疏：荒是眇莽，叹其久远。央是尽义，嗟其未息。言众生染滞之心，其日固久，执着情笃，未有休时。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"Ungoverned\" (荒) is a state of vast confusion, lamenting its prolonged existence. \"End\" (央) signifies completion, yet it is mourned that there is no rest. The words describe how sentient beings’ minds are stained and ensnared, their days long, their attachments deep, and their restlessness without pause.\n\n众人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登台。\n\nThe masses bustle and rejoice, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meats, like ascending the spring platform in revelry.\n\n御注：众人俗学有为，熙熙逐境，如临享太牢，春台登望，动生贪欲。\n\nRiver Shang Master’s Commentary: The common folk indulge in conventional learning and artificial pursuits, their emotions stirred and desires aroused, as if they were about to feast on the grandest sacrificial meats or ascend the spring platform to gaze upon the world.\n\n○御疏：熙熙者，情欲淫动之貌。此明不畏绝俗学之人也。夫俗学有学为，动生情欲，熙熙逐境，役役终身，如馁夫之临享太牢，恣贪滋味，怡容之春台登望，动生爱着。太牢者，牛羊豕也。春台所以为爱着，谓其卉木滋荣，禽乌呜匹，阳和陶然，易淫荡也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"Bustling and rejoicing\" (熙熙) depicts the unrestrained movement of emotions and desires. This illustrates those who do not fear and abandon conventional learning. Such learning, with its artificial pursuits, stirs emotions and desires, driving them to chase after transient things, enslaving them for life. It is like a starving man before a grand sacrificial feast, greedily indulging in flavors, or a contented person ascending the spring platform to gaze upon verdant fields, where love and attachment are easily kindled. The \"grand sacrificial meats\" (太牢) refer to oxen, sheep, and pigs. The spring platform invites attachment because its lush vegetation, the harmonious calls of birds, and the gentle warmth of the season all stir unbridled passion.\n\n故《豳诗》云：春日迟迟，探蘩祁祁，女心伤悲，迨及公子同归。\n\nThus the *Book of Odes* says: *\"The spring days linger on\"* (春日迟迟), *\"the picking of wild plants is frequent\"* (探蘩祁祁), *\"the maiden’s heart is wounded with sorrow\"* (女心伤悲), *\"until the noble son returns with her\"* (迨及公子同归).\n\n○河上公曰：众人熙熙，熙熙，淫佚多情砍。如享太牢，如饥思太牢之具，意无足时也。如春登台，春阴阳交通，万物感动，登台观之，志意淫佚。\n\nRiver Shang Master said: The masses bustle and rejoice, their desires unrestrained and emotions overflowing. Like feasting on the grand sacrificial meats, they crave them as if starving, their intentions never sated. Like ascending the spring platform, where yin and yang merge and all things are stirred, they gaze upon it, their wills and desires lost in indulgence.\n\n○荣曰：熙熙，悦乐也。太牢，味也。春台，色也。言流俗众人务学以规名声，纵情以昏色味，悦之以目，不知盲之有时。适之以口，不知爽之有日。逐欲老而愈溢，劳形困而不休，仍自欣欣以为悦乐也。\n\nHonor said: \"Bustling and rejoicing\" (熙熙) is delight and pleasure. The \"grand sacrificial meats\" (太牢) are flavors; the \"spring platform\" (春台) is color. The common folk strive in learning to seek fame, indulge emotions in the murky shades of taste and color, and gratify the senses with eyes and mouths—yet they do not know that blindness has its limits or that satiety has its day. As they age in their pursuit of desires, their cravings only grow more excessive; their bodies weary yet they rest not, yet they still take pride in their endless pleasure.\n\n○成疏：言耽染者众，故云众人，即众生之别称也。熙熙，悦乐也。享，燕享也。太牢，牛羊豕也。言众生欣爱声色，情染极深，如饥人享太牢之馔，悦美色之甚，又如春日登台，眺望林野，畅适其心也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: It speaks of how many are ensnared, hence \"the masses\" (众人), another term for sentient beings. \"Bustling and rejoicing\" (熙熙) is delight and pleasure. \"Feast\" (享) means to enjoy a banquet. The \"grand sacrificial meats\" (太牢) are oxen, sheep, and pigs. The words describe how sentient beings are captivated by sounds and colors, their emotions deeply entangled—like a starving man feasting on grand sacrificial meats, or like ascending the spring platform on a spring day to gaze upon forests and fields, finding their hearts fully satisfied.\n\n第四对辨圣人之悟，以治凡鄙之迷。\n\n**The Fourth Point: Contrasting the Sage’s Awakening with the Common Folks’ Illusion**\n\n我独泊兮其未兆，若婴儿之未孩。\n\nI alone remain tranquil, my nature yet unmanifested—like an infant before its first smile.\n\n御注：我独泊然安静，於情欲略无形，如彼婴儿，未能孩孺也。\n\nRiver Shang Master’s Commentary: I alone remain tranquil and still, with no trace of emotions or desires. It is like that infant, which has not yet begun to smile and play.\n\n○御疏：我者，老君自称，言我畏绝俗学，学道含和，独能泊然安静，於彼代间有为之事，情欲等法，略无形兆。如彼婴儿，未孩笑，无分别也。孩者，别人之意。《庄子》曰：不至于孩而始谁。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"I\" (我) is the self-reference of the Old Master (老君). It states that I fear and abandon conventional learning, practice the Dao with harmony, and alone am able to remain tranquil and still. Toward the transient affairs of the world, emotions, and desires, I show no form or trace. Like that infant, I have not yet begun to smile or distinguish things. \"Infant\" (孩) refers to the mind of one who does not yet separate. *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Only when one does not reach the stage of infantile simplicity does one begin to be confused.\"*\n\n○河上公曰：我独泊兮其未兆，我独泊然安静，未有情欲之形兆也。如婴兄之未孩，如小儿未能答偶人时。\n\nRiver Shang Master said: \"I alone remain tranquil\" (我独泊兮其未兆), meaning I alone remain tranquil and still, with no trace of emotions or desires. Like a younger brother who has not yet begun to smile, or like a child who cannot yet respond to others.\n\n○荣曰：圣人言众人驰骛於有为之境，为声色之所动，我澹泊於无为之端，香味不能惑，犹如赤子未识牝牡之合，不知淫佚之情，心无所在，岂定有归也。\n\nHonor said: The Sage speaks of how the common folk rush about in the world of artificial pursuits, moved by sounds and colors. I, however, remain serene at the Dao of non-action, unaffected by fragrances or flavors—like an infant who does not yet know the union of male and female, nor the emotions of lust and indulgence. My heart is without attachment; how could it have a fixed abode?\n\n○成疏：我魄未兆，我，老君自称也。魄，寂也。兆，状。言圣人虽处俗尘，而心知寂魄，不为前境之所牵，故都无攀绿之萌状也。若婴儿未孩，魁无所归，婴儿，赤子也，孩，笑也，魁，宽大也，归，住着也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"My nature yet unmanifested\" (我魄未兆), where \"I\" (我) is the Old Master’s self-reference. \"Nature\" (魄) means stillness; \"manifested\" (兆) means form. The Sage, though dwelling in the dust of the world, knows the stillness of their nature and is not drawn by what lies before them—thus they show no trace of grasping at transient pleasures. Like an infant before its first smile, their nature is boundless and without fixed abode. An infant is a newborn child; \"smile\" (孩) refers to the first signs of joy. \"Boundless\" (魁) means vast and unrestrained; \"abode\" (归) signifies dwelling and attachment.\n\nThe Sage moves without defying stillness, dwells amid defilement yet remains unstained—\nlike an infant before its first smile, when both heart and form are pure.\nYet their wisdom is boundless and vast, their capacity vast as the empty sky,\na boat without a fixed mooring, drifting where the current wills.\n\n*Buying buying*—as if without destination.\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** The Perfect One has no heart; movement follows things without taking or giving,\nlike a traveler with no place to return to.\n*Buying buying*—the likeness of motion.\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** *Buying buying*—the appearance of motion.\n\nThe common crowd moves and clings, ever grasping, ever seeking—\nthus they seem to have a place to go.\nI have no heart, serene and at ease;\nI ride the current and pass, meet obstacles and halt.\nLike one who walks the Dao, with nowhere to hasten—\nno restless striving.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** I drift like a rustic in the wilderness, with nowhere to seek.\n\nThe common crowd all have excess.\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** They indulge in worldly affairs, boast of cleverness and wisdom,\nand claim to have abundance, as if to display their grandeur.\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** The common crowd all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\nThe common crowd cling to vulgar learning, boast of cleverness and wisdom—\nthese are all attachments they hold.\nThey claim to have abundance, while I alone diminish and never linger,\nmy heart untouched by love or defilement—\nthus I seem forgotten.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** The common crowd hoard wealth for extravagance,\nhoard wisdom for deceit.\n\n**Master Rong says:** The common crowd all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\nThe vulgar, in purity, feel lacking; in filth, they overflow.\nThey amass wealth as external burdens, indulge desires to deepen inner defilement.\nThe Sage remains unstained by dust, abandons worldly affairs—\nthus they seem abandoned.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** The common crowd all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\nThe common crowd cling to what they possess, thus they are stained by excess.\nThe Sage’s wisdom embodies emptiness, alone abandoning and taking nothing.\n\nYet I alone seem abandoned.\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Always as if insufficient, as if forgotten.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** I alone seem abandoned, as if lacking.\n\nMy heart is that of a simple fool—\npure and unadorned.\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Am I truly the heart of a fool, forgotten like this?\nBut my heart is pure and unadorned—\nthus I seem abandoned.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** In all things, I embody non-attachment—\nthus I seem forgotten. How could I be like the heart of a fool?\nBut my heart is pure and unadorned, simple and without love or desire—\nthus I say, I seem abandoned.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** My heart is that of a simple fool—\nnot following the vulgar, steadfast in the One, unmoved.\n\nPure and unadorned—\nwithout distinction.\n\n**Master Rong says:** The vulgar are foolish, yet they deem themselves wise.\nSome are ever deeper in desire’s filth,\nuntil the Sage’s great wisdom seems like folly—\nform and spirit serene and empty,\npure and white, ever thus.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Pure*—unmixed.\nThe Sage’s wisdom is empty and white, pure and refined,\nlike the simple fool’s heart, without distinction.\n\nThe vulgar are bright and discerning—\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Boasting of cleverness and wisdom.\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** The vulgar are bright and discerning, while I alone seem dim.\n\nThe vulgar are sharp and probing—\nI alone am dull and obscured.\n*Bright and discerning*—they pride themselves in cleverness and artifice.\n*Dim*—like one lost in confusion, without distinction.\n*Sharp and probing*—they impose laws to judge others.\n*Dull and obscured*—the breadth of simplicity.\n\nThus the bright and discerning boast of cleverness,\nthe sharp and probing impose laws—\nall because they never sever from vulgar learning and worldly action.\nHence the Sage fears severance as if it were dimness and silence.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** Clear and penetrating.\n\n**Master Rong says:** Though they speak much, they know not the inner clarity of the heart,\nnor the radiance that shines outward.\nThey proclaim their own understanding—\nthus they say, *bright and discerning*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** The vulgar are bright and discerning, while I alone seem dim.\nThe vulgar’s hearts are dark and confused, yet they brightly distinguish—\nthey dazzle themselves with their abilities.\nThe Sage’s wisdom is empty and

says:** Like one in darkness.\n\n**Master Rong says:** Knowing yet feigning ignorance, as if in shadow.\n\nThe vulgar are sharp and probing—\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** They establish laws and regulations.\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** Hasty and swift, establishing laws and regulations.\n**Master Rong says:** Their passions are sharp in the realm of right and wrong,\ntheir hearts fixed on paths of gain and loss.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** The vulgar are sharp and probing, I alone am dull and obscured.\nSharp and probing—this is the heart of distinction.\nDull and obscured—this is the wisdom of non-distinction.\nBut the vulgar’s hearts cling to what they possess,\nthey probe right and wrong, and rush in haste.\nThe Sage’s wisdom is empty and void,\nthey embody the knowledge of

*用有为* means *to employ worldly actions*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:** All people have some purpose,\nI alone seem coarse and lacking—\nwhile others are entangled in desire,\nI never rest.\nThough they gather different teachings,\nwe share the same root.\nThe sage perceives the emptiness of all phenomena,\nnever distinguishing between right and wrong,\nnor seeing them as they are.\nLike the dull and ignorant,\nor the coarse and lacking.\n\nThe fifth passage alone reveals the sage’s special ability to employ the Dao.\n\nI alone seem coarse and lacking—\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** *顽* means lacking distinction,\n*鄙* means coarse and lacking,\nyet my heart is truly enlightened.\n\nExternally appearing insufficient—\nthus it is said, *as if so*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** I alone seem coarse and lacking,\nI alone act without worldly purpose,\nas if lacking—\nlike one who does not reach.\n\n**Master Rong says:** Like the ignorant fool’s lack of knowledge,\nor the lowly’s lack of adornment.\n\nI alone differ from others—\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** Others have emotions and desires,\nI have none.\n\nOthers oppose the Dao,\nI align with it.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** I alone differ from others,\nyet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.\nThese two sentences conclude the thought.\nI alone differ from others—\ndiffering from the common folk who never abandon learning.\nAll teachings differ from the vulgar,\nwho cling to worldly desires,\nwhile I alone cast aside emotions and desires.\nOthers distinguish among teachings,\nI alone equate to non-duality.\nThus it is said, *I alone differ from others*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** I alone differ from others.\n\n**Master Rong says:** I wish to differ from others,\nyet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.\n*Sustenance* means *employ*,\n*Mother* means *the Dao*.\nOthers seek fulfillment,\nwithout need of words.\nThings lose their nature,\nso the sage establishes teachings.\nFrom *Spring Terrace* onward,\nall are afflictions of worldly existence.\nThe sage follows the disease to cure it,\nusing the medicine of *non-action* to heal worldly afflictions.\nThe medicine is universal,\nyet the application differs.\nThe vulgar are stuck in convention,\nthe sage employs the Dao—\nthus it is said, *honoring seeking sustenance from the Mother*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:** I alone differ from others,\nyet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.\n*Sustenance* means *employ*,\n*Mother* means *the Dao*.\nOthers observe and distinguish,\nI alone seem obscured and forgetful.\nDistinction leads to attachment to sounds and colors,\nforgetfulness leads to honoring the true Dao—\nthus the difference.\nYet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** Seeking sustenance from the Mother—\nvaluing like an infant without worldly desires.\nThus the earlier passage says, *like an infant before it knows speech*,\nand the following scripture says, *thick with virtue, compared to a newborn babe*.\nThis is why I alone differ from others.\n\nOriginally without *先无求、於两字*,\nnow added.\n\nMoreover, the sage’s teaching\nhas no need to avoid taboo.\nYet when adapted for instruction,\nit may raise suspicion.\nTo clarify principles, the meaning cannot be altered,\nbut when applied in context,\nit must be stable and convenient.\nConvenience preserves the ancient while accommodating the present—\nthis is the ideal.\n\nAgain, Sima Qian says:\nThe *Laozi*’s five thousand words\nare about clarifying principles and ceasing speech,\nnot necessarily fixed in number.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** The *Laozi* warns people\nto guard simplicity and preserve harmony,\nto minimize selfishness and avoid excess,\nto cut off attachment to sights and sounds,\nto block the pursuit of fame and fortune.\nTo be like an infant,\nonly seeking sustenance from the Mother—\nthus it is said, *yet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** *Sustenance* means *employ*,\n*Mother* means *the Dao*.\nI alone employ the Dao.\n\n*End of Volume Five: Mysterious Virtue Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue*\n*Volume Six: Mysterious Virtue Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue*\n*Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Annotations and Commentaries*\n*Strict Annotations by Master He Shang Gong (严君平), Li Rong (李荣), and Cheng Xuan (成玄英)*\n*Collated by Master Qiang Si (强思齐)*\n*Chapter Twenty-One: The Appearance of the Sage’s Virtue*\n\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous:\nThe prior chapter expounds on the sage who abandons learning\nand honors the true Dao.\nThis chapter elaborates on the noble bearing of such a person,\nwithin which the text unfolds in four layers.\n\n**First Layer:** Revealing the one who attains enlightenment,\nwhose appearance aligns with the Dao.\n\nThe Great Form is without shape,\nthe Perfect One operates in secret.\nThey transcend the three purities while freely indulging,\nthey rise above the six *qi* yet remain detached.\nTo know their appearance—\ntruly, it cannot be compared.\n\nDispersed, they become *qi*,\nenclosing the hundred million heavens.\nGathered, they become spirit,\nentering and exiting the nine *yuán* halls.\nAbove the Imperial City,\nthey ride the white clouds,\nbefore the Pass of Han,\nthey float on purple *qi*.\nResponding to things, they move—\nlike a crane returning after a thousand years.\nFollowing the time, they act—\nlike a dragon leaping in five hues.\nOnly vague and indistinct—\nthe appearance of the Sage’s Virtue.\n\nThe Sage’s Virtue follows only the Dao.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** *孔* means *great*,\n*从* means *to follow*.\nAsking: What is the appearance of one with great virtue?\nTheir actions follow only the Dao of utmost emptiness.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"Kong\"* means \"great.\"\n*\"Cong\"* means \"to follow.\"\n*\"Rong\"* refers to one’s appearance.\n\nTo illuminate how a scholar aligns with the Supreme Dao, it is asked: What is the appearance of one with great virtue? It is said that the appearance of one with great virtue follows only the Dao of utmost emptiness.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"Kong\"* means \"great.\"\nThe appearance of great virtue—great virtue encompasses all things, able to receive filth and impurity, dwelling in humility.\n\"Uniquely follows the Dao\"—*\"yi\"* means \"solely.\" One of great virtue does not conform to worldly conventions but follows the Dao alone.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\n*\"Kong\"* means \"great,\" \"vast,\" the Dao being principle and virtue.\nAll things are contained within it, hence it is called *rong* (appearance).\nAll actions conform to principle—thus it is said to \"follow.\"\nIt is also said that great virtue does not arise from elsewhere but comes solely from the Dao.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Kong\"* means \"great,\" \"vast.\"\n*\"Rong\"* refers to form and appearance.\nThe appearance of one with vast virtue—how does it manifest? It follows the Dao, and that is its essence.\nAlternatively: *\"Rong\"* means \"to embrace.\"\nGreat virtue harmonizes subtly, thus able to remain empty and all-encompassing. In action or stillness, speech or silence, all are manifestations of the Dao.\nThis reveals the Dao one attains—neither existence nor nonexistence.\nThe Dao, as a phenomenon, is vague and indistinct.\n**Imperial Commentary:** This clarifies that the Dao followed by one of great virtue is neither existent nor nonexistent, its boundless operation defying name, hence \"vague and indistinct.\"\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This elucidates the subtle, ultimate origin as the form of things—precisely the Dao followed by one of great virtue.\nThe subtle, ultimate origin, forcibly named \"Dao.\"\nWhat is the Dao as a phenomenon? How does it move and rest in form?\nIt is said that this origin is neither existent nor nonexistent, difficult to name.\nTo call it existent, it is still and formless.\nTo call it nonexistent, it subtly persists.\nSince it is indeterminate, it is called \"vague and indistinct.\"\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao, among all things, uniquely moves in vague indistinctness.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\nNot yet knowing what the Dao is, yet virtue follows it clearly.\nThe Great Dao is profound and mysterious, too deep to comprehend.\nTo say it is nonexistent, yet it is formless unity.\nTo say it exists, yet it returns to nothingness.\nReturning to nothingness yet not nonexistent—\nspeaking of existence yet not existent—\nexistence and nonexistence are indeterminate,\nlife and death are undefined—\nhence it is called \"vague and indistinct.\"\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe Supreme Dao as a phenomenon—\nthough existent, it is nonexistent;\nthough nonexistent, it is existent.\nThough existent, it is not existent;\nthough nonexistent, it is not nonexistent.\nExistence and nonexistence are indeterminate—\nhence it is called \"vague and indistinct.\"\nSpeaking of \"things\" is to clarify that the Dao does not depart from things, nor do things depart from the Dao.\nOutside the Dao, there are no things;\noutside things, there is no Dao.\nAction is the Dao and things;\nessence is things and the Dao.\nIt also clarifies that enlightenment is the Dao and things,\ndelusion is things and the Dao.\nThe Dao and things are neither one nor different,\nyet different and one,\nneither one nor not one—\nthus things and the Dao,\none yet not one—\nneither Dao nor things,\nneither things hence one,\nnot one hence things—\nthus not one, not one.\n\n**Thirdly, this reveals the Sage’s body as the unity of the Three.**\nVague and indistinct—\nwithin it, forms appear.\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"Hu\"* means \"nonexistent.\"\n*\"Huo\"* means \"existent.\"\n*\"Zhao\"* reveals forms.\nFrom nonexistence descending into existence,\nwithin it, all forms manifest.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This clarifies the origin and its traces.\n*\"Hu\"* means \"nonexistent.\"\n*\"Huo\"* means \"existent.\"\n*\"Zhao\"* reveals forms.\nThe origin is formless, hence called *\"hu.\"*\nGeneration and transformation manifest form, hence called *\"huo.\"*\nThus, from nonexistence descending into existence,\nwithin it, all forms manifest—\nfrom origin to trace.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThough the Dao is vague and indistinct, formless,\nit alone is the pattern for all things.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\nWithin vague indistinctness, forms exist;\nwithin indistinctness, things exist—\nthe true reality of neither existence nor nonexistence,\nthe most profound and mysterious Dao,\nsplitting the One Origin to manifest the Three Forms,\nharmonizing the Two *qi* to generate all things.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nWithin vague indistinctness, forms exist;\nwithin indistinctness, things exist—\nwithin things exists *shen* (spirit),\nthe wondrous transformation of things is named.\nThough neither existent nor nonexistent,\nyet existent and nonexistent—\nhence it is wondrous.\nWithin forms exists the nonexistent;\nthough neither form nor color,\nyet it becomes color and form—\nhence it is *qi*.\nThe Dao manifests in varied transformations—\nthus it is neither thing nor form,\nyet thing and form.\nVague and indistinct—\nwithin it, things exist.\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n\"Things\" refers to the Dao as a phenomenon mentioned above.\nFrom existence returning to nonexistence,\nrestoring the Supreme Dao—\nhence it is said that within it, things exist.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\n\"Things\" refers to the subtle origin mentioned above.\nThe origin descending into generation,\nmanifesting all forms,\ncultivating nature to return to virtue—\nthen it returns to formlessness.\nFormlessness is the Dao.\nIt is said that through human cultivation of nature and return to virtue,\nnot departing from the origin,\nfrom existence returning to nonexistence,\nsubtly merging with the Supreme Dao—\nhence it is said that within it, things exist—\nspeaking of subtle things.\nThis gathers traces to return to the origin.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao’s vague indistinctness—\nwithin it, there is One,\ndirecting generation and transformation,\nestablishing substance through *qi*.\n\n**Mysterious and dark—**\nwithin it, there is essence.\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nVague indistinctness in existence and nonexistence,\nmysterious darkness beyond measure—\nthe operation of generation is exquisitely preserved.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\n\"Mysterious and dark\" means profound obscurity.\nThe ultimate emptiness descending into generation,\ncultivating nature to return to virtue,\ngathering traces to return to the origin—\nsubtle things may persist,\nmysterious and dark, immeasurable,\ncontaining transformation—\nwithin it, there is supreme essence.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao is only mysterious and dark, formless—\nwithin it, there is essence,\nthe vital interaction of the numinous and the luminous,\nthe convergence of yin and yang.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\nThe ultimate principle is singular, hence it is called *precise and wondrous*.\nIts substance undergoes no change, hence it is called *true*.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Mysterious and dark\"* means profound and distant.\n*\"Within it, there is essence\"* refers to *enlightened wisdom*.\nThough the Dao is mysterious and dark, formless and indistinct,\nits spirit is most refined, its wisdom unbounded,\nits divine function unfathomable.\nIts essence is supremely true—\n**within it, there is veracity.**\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThe essence in profound darkness\nis inherently unadulterated.\nWhen things respond, it must correspond—\nits responses are never erroneous.\nHence it is said: *within it, there is veracity.*\n\n**○ Imperial Exegesis:**\nThe Dao’s wondrous transformations,\nrooted in authenticity, are never false.\nIts generative function pervades all existence—\nwhen things respond, they must correspond,\nnever deviating in the slightest.\nThus it is said: *within it, there is veracity.*\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"Its essence is supremely true\"*—\nthe Dao’s vital essence is truly authentic,\nnot a false pretense.\n*\"Within it, there is veracity\"*—\nthe Dao conceals its efficacy;\nits veracity lies within.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\nSilent, without form,\nyet responsive and instantly resonant—\nblessing the virtuous, punishing the licentious,\nits influence is ever-present.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Its essence is supremely true\"*—\nthe true essence is unadulterated,\nnot hollow or false.\nWithin the *Three-in-One* (三一),\nit emphasizes essence to clarify\nthat essence is the foundation of *radiant vitality and divine function*.\n*\"Within it, there is veracity\"*—\nthe Mysterious Dao acts without intent,\nyet responds to stimuli with certainty,\nas reliable as the seasons,\nnever erring in the slightest.\n\nThe fourth insight reveals:\nthe Dao has no origin, no end,\nyet knows both beginning and completion.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name does not fade.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThe Dao, from ancient times to the present,\ngenerates all things.\nThings obtain their function through the Dao,\nand their names arise from their use.\nSince the generative function is the same through time,\nthe names applied to its responses\nare thus unchanging from ancient to modern.\n\n**○ Imperial Exegesis:**\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits essence remains unaltered.\n*\"Observe all origins\"*—\n*Observe* means to measure and discern.\n*Origins* refers to their beginnings.\nThe Dao’s generative function,\nits mysterious and true essence,\nis eternal and unchanging.\nThus, things obtaining the Dao’s function—\nthe harmony of heaven and earth—\nfrom ancient times to the present,\nremains ever-present and unceasing.\nHence the commentary:\n*\"The generative function is the same through time,\nso the names applied to its responses\nare thus unchanging from ancient to modern.\"*\nThrough this true and veracious essence,\nit measures and discerns the origins of all things,\nallowing each to fulfill its generative function.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"From\"* means *following*.\nThe Dao follows from ancient times to the present,\never-present and unceasing.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name does not fade,\nto observe all origins—\n*Observe* means *to examine*,\n*Origins* means *beginnings*.\nThe ignorant lack understanding,\ncommon sentiment is obstructed,\nand they claim that the mysterious and dark principle\nis inherently severed from causes,\nthat within indistinctness,\nthere is no retribution.\nThus, those who do good grow lax,\nand the wicked persist unrepentant.\nThey fail to recognize that essence is alive,\nhow could they know that truth is real?\n*\"Within it, there is veracity\"*—\nto illuminate the principle’s authenticity,\nto save all beings,\nto establish methods and teachings,\nfrom end to beginning,\nexamining the causes of good and evil—\nfrom ancient times to the present,\njudging deeds of depravity and rectitude—\nthe loyal and filial are rewarded with rank,\nthe treacherous and regicidal are punished with law.\nIt encompasses both emptiness and substance,\npervading the cosmos.\nIts form is independent and ever-present,\nits name serene and unceasing.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nTime has both ancient and modern eras,\nyet the Dao has neither origin nor end.\nSince its name does not fade,\nit sufficiently demonstrates its non-origin.\nThe text is concise for brevity’s sake.\n\n*\"To observe all origins\"*—\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*Observe* means *to measure and discern*.\n\n「**甫**—the primal origin.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao’s application,\nto measure and discern all things from their primal origin,\neach fulfilling its innate function of growth and transformation.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\n*Observe* (阅) means *to receive* (禀).\n**甫**—the origin.\nSpeaking of all things’ birth,\nthey arise from the Dao receiving *qi* (气).\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Observe* (阅) means *to survey* (览).\n**甫**—the origin.\nThough the supreme Dao has neither origin nor end,\nit is also ever-present in coming and going,\nthus able to survey antiquity and discern the present,\nto encompass both end and beginning.\nHow do I know that all things arise this way?\nBy this.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\nBy this, one knows all things receive the Dao,\nand through its wondrous functions, they transform and manifest.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**\nFurther elaborating on the passage:\nHow do I know that all things’ primal origins\nreceive and draw from the Dao,\nthat the Dao must measure and discern them,\nto fulfill their growth and transformation?\nThe answer is:\nThis is because the Dao is supremely refined and trustworthy—\nall things today receive its wondrous functions and thus manifest,\nso one knows it this way.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nHow do I know that all things arise this way?\nHow do I know that the Dao receives *qi* (气)?\nBy this.\nThis—*the present* (今).\nWith the present’s refinement,\nall things obtain the Dao’s refined *qi*,\nand thus they arise.\nHuman actions and movements,\nwithout the Dao, would not be so.\n\n**○ Master Rong said:**\nHow do I know the great Dao from ancient times to the present,\nfrom beginning to end,\nsurveying all things,\ndistinguishing among people,\nfreeing the Fourfold Birth (四生),\nand preserving the Three Dynasties (三代)?\nOnly by observing it in the seen and now,\ncan one know of the past and future.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThis is a rhetorical question.\nThe Sage Laozi says:\nI know of beginning and end,\nby relying on this true and pure Dao,\nthe vague and obscure laws (法).\nThus, I know it.\n\n---\n**曲则全**—*Bending yields completeness.*\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor the earlier chapter only partially presented\nConfucius’ *virtue/power* (德) and bearing,\nso this chapter continues,\nreiterating Confucius’ conduct,\nable to serve as a model for all things,\nand establishing four distinct divisions.\n\n**First:** Demonstrating the Four Conducts of the Root (因地四行),\nto show his humility and harmony.\n**Second:** Illuminating the One Mature Essence (妙体一中),\nas the standard for all things.\n**Third:** Displaying the Four Virtues of the Fruit (果上四德),\nto contrast with the earlier conducts.\n**Fourth:** Citing ancient precedents,\nto resolve doubts and complete the chapter.\n\n**First:** Demonstrating the Four Conducts of the Root (因地四行),\nto show his humility and harmony.\n\nThe great *form* (象) takes the cosmos as its furnace,\nthe Sage takes *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power* (德) as foundation.\nAll things, vast as clouds,\nare contained within a grain of millet.\nThe Four Great Elements (四大) soar high,\nyet are borne upon the Lion’s peak (师子之上).\n\n*Bending* (曲) and *completeness* (全) are spoken of—\ncomparing the Sage to the *Lingma* (列麻),\nthe wind and strings (风琴) move sound,\nsummoning all spirits to the *Yan Tree* (骞树).\nWith compassion, he pardons all things;\nwith *law* (法), he nurtures all life.\nHis conduct is profound,\nhis merit of non-reproach is ever-present.\nIf one practices it,\nlike the Prince of Jin ascending the clouds,\nit is not beyond human reach.\nIf one embraces it,\nlike Li Shaojun serving the Han,\nthose who hold to the One (抱一) will be guided by the Dao,\nand their completion will be true.\n*Bending yields completeness*—\nis this not an honest claim?\n\n**曲则全**—*Bending yields completeness.*\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\nBending oneself to fulfill duties,\nthen one attains completeness.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**\n*Bending* (曲)—to yield and comply.\nSpeaking of how one can preserve oneself\nby yielding to all things without contradiction,\nthus attaining completeness of life.\nHence, it is said: *Bending yields completeness.*\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nBending oneself to follow the multitude,\nnot clinging to self,\nthen one attains completeness.\n\n**○ Master Yan said:**\nEven if a sovereign is Sage-like,\nhe must still practice *bending*—\ndelegating to officials while governing,\nhis *virtue/power* (德) thus attains completeness.\n\n**○ Master Rong said:**\n*Bending yields completeness,*\n*crookedness yields uprightness,*\n*hollow yields fullness,*\n*worn-out yields renewal,*\n*simplicity yields attainment,*\n*excess yields confusion.*\nExternally yielding to all things,\ninternally nourishing the spirit,\nharmony between self and all—\nthis is completeness.\nBow to others, yet do not lose the Dao—\nthis is uprightness.\nRetreat in humility, dwelling low—\nthis is *hollow*.\nPure yet not turbid—\nthis is *renewal*.\nThe root is inherently One,\nthus it is said: *simplicity*.\nForgotten words align with the Dao,\nthus it is said: *attainment*.\nThe myriad forms of existence,\nthe myriad teachings and doctrines—\nthus it is said: *excess*.\nChasing desires brings confusion,\nobstructed teachings bring delusion—\nthus it is said: *confusion*.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nBending and yielding to follow,\nnot opposing the natural inclinations of things,\ngentle and yielding in humility,\npreserving life and nurturing the Dao—\nthus the *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"My path bends and yields,\nyet it does not harm my feet.\"*\nThis sentence forgets the yielding to harmony.\n\n---\n**枉则直**—*Crookedness yields uprightness.*\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\nTo endure crookedness for the sake of others,\nthen one attains uprightness.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**\n*Crookedness*—to endure wrongs from others.\n*Uprightness*—to correct what is crooked.\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋) say:\n*\"To straighten the crooked is uprightness.\"*\nThough one does not oppose things,\nif others come with wrongs,\nand one can endure their crookedness,\nthey will be shamed and rectify themselves—\nthen one’s uprightness corrects their crookedness.\nHence, it is said: *crookedness*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nTo endure wrongs for others’ sake,\nin time, one attains uprightness.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Crookedness*—to endure defamation.\nThe body knows no distinction between crookedness and uprightness,\nthus able to receive slander\nwithout retaliating in wrongful reproach,\nbut instead to uphold the Dao’s rectitude.\nThis sentence forgets the defamation and praise.\n\n---\n**洼则盈**—*Hollow yields fullness.*\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\nTo uphold humble *virtue/power* (德),\nthen one attains fullness.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**\n*Hollow*—to aid what is low.\n*Fullness*—to be satisfied.\nThis is a metaphorical explanation.\nIf the earth is low and yielding,\nwater flows and fills it.\nIf one steadfastly upholds humility,\n*virtue/power* (德) becomes boundless.\nTo be able to bend and endure wrongs—\nthis is *hollow*.\nTo attain completeness and uprightness—\nthis is *fullness*.\nHence, it is said: *Hollow yields fullness.*\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nThe earth is low and yielding,\nwater flows into it.\nHumans are low and yielding,\n*virtue/power* (德) returns to them.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Hollow*—to be low.\nHumility, meekness, and yielding—\nretiring oneself to a low place,\nnot competing with things for height—\nthus one’s conduct and *virtue/power* (德) become full and complete.\nThis sentence forgets the high and low.\n\n---\n**弊则新**—*Worn-out yields renewal.*\n\n「To bend, to be low, and to endure wrongs—\nall are ways of placing oneself in *privation/deficiency* (弊).\nTo place oneself in privation,\nothers will exalt you first,\nand thus your *virtue/power* (德) is renewed daily—\nhence, it is said: *Worn-out yields renewal.*\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nTo accept privation oneself,\nto place others before self—\nthe world respects this.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Privation* (弊) is *humiliation*.\nTo endure *humiliation, ignominy, and privation* (鄙恶弊辱),\nyet not covet *honor and favor* (荣宠),\nthis is how one’s *virtue/power* (德) is renewed—\nthis sentence forgets *honor and humiliation* (荣辱).\n\n**Secondly, it illustrates the *Mystic Body* (妙体) of unity,\nserving as a *model/pattern* (楷式) for all things.**\n*Then one attains* (则得).\n**御注:** To embrace the *One* (一) without departing from it—\nthis is how one avoids *loss* (失).\n\n**○御疏:** *Fewness attains* (少则得),\n*excess leads to confusion* (多则惑).\nThus, the *Sage* (圣人) embraces the *One* (一) as the *model/pattern* (式) for all under heaven.\n*Fewness*—to take from oneself—\nthis is how one avoids *loss* (失),\nhence it is said: *attains*.\n*Excess*—to rely on oneself—\nothers will surely dispute,\nhence it is said: *confusion*.\nWhen refining one’s person, it is the same;\nwhen cultivating the *Dao/Way* (道), likewise—\none must embrace and guard the *pure, unadulterated One* (淳一),\nto preserve one’s *true, original nature* (真素).\n\nIf one seeks to broadly pursue *heterodox paths* (异门),\nthis will invite *chaos and confusion* (乱惑).\nHence, the *lost sheep* (亡羊) perishes at the *crossroads* (叉因於歧路),\nand the *life lost* (丧生) occurs through *many directions* (谅在於多方).\n\nThus, the *Sage* embraces the *One* without departing,\nand can serve as the *law/standard* (法式) for all under heaven.\n*Pattern* (式) is *law* (法).\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\n*Fewness*—to accept privation—\nthis is how one attains *excess*.\nThe *Heavenly Way* (天道) aids the *humble*,\nand the *Divine Light* (神明) entrusts itself to the *empty/virtuous* (虚).\n\n**○ Master Yan said:**\n*Fewness*—to restrict oneself—\nthough one remains in fewness,\nall things will naturally attain their proper place.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Fewness attains* (少则得),\n*excess leads to confusion* (多则惑).\n*Fewness*—referring to the *conduct of bending, being low, and complete* (曲全等行),\nunaware of high or low,\ndwelling in the *One* (一中).\n*Excess*—to be entangled in *obedience and disobedience* (违顺等法),\nnot departing from the *two extremes* (二偏).\nTo dwell in the *One* (一中) is to be entangled by the *two extremes* (二偏),\nhence *confusion* (迷惑).\n*Excess leads to confusion* (多则惑).\n\n**○御注:** To engage in *many doctrines* (有为多门)\nis to invite *confusion and chaos* (惑乱).\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nThose with *many possessions* (财多者) are confused by guarding their person,\nthose with *much learning* (学多者) are confused by what they hear.\n\n**○ Master Yan said:**\nTo trust oneself and indulge in thought,\nnot to rely on others,\nyet to speak and know much—\nthis leads to *madness and chaos* (狂乱).\n\nThus, the *Sage* embraces the *One* as the *model/pattern* (式) for all under heaven.\n**御注:** The *Sage* embraces and guards the *pure, unadulterated One* (淳一),\nand thus can serve as the *law/standard* (法式) for all under heaven.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\n*Embrace* (抱) is *guard* (守).\n*Pattern* (式) is *law* (法).\nThe *Sage* guards the *One* (一), completing all affairs,\nand thus can serve as the *law/standard* (法式) for all under heaven.\n\n**○ Master Rong said:**\n*The One* (一) is the *Dao/Way* (道).\nThe *Sage* cherishes the *Dao/Way* (道),\nhence it is said: *embrace the One*.\nAll actions align with *principle* (理),\ncapable of guiding all things,\nhence it is said: *pattern*.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Thus* (是以) follows the previous statement.\n*Embrace* (抱) is *to uphold and cherish* (守持).\n*Pattern* (式) is *law/standard* (法则).\nIt speaks of how the *Sage* upholds this *One* (一) within the *Dao/Way*,\nas a guiding model for all beings,\nand thus serves as the *paragon of cultivation* (修学之楷模) for all under heaven.\n\n**Thirdly, it reveals the *fruits* (果) of the four *virtues/powers* (德) above,\ncontrasting with the *prior conduct* (前行).**\n\n**Not to reveal oneself—this is how clarity is attained.**\n**御注:** If one does not reveal their own *virtue/power* (德),\nconstantly bending oneself to respond to duties,\nthen their *virtue/power* (德) will naturally be fully illuminated.\n\n**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields completeness* (曲则全).\nIt says that if one does not reveal their own *beauty* (美),\nyet *surrenders and obeys* (委顺) to all things,\nthen their *complete virtue/power* (全德) will daily grow more manifest—\nhence, it is said: *thus clarity is attained*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nThe *Sage* does not use their own eyes to see beyond a thousand miles,\nbut relies on the eyes of all under heaven to see—\nthus they can illuminate the distant.\n\n**○ Master Yan said:**\nThe *Sage* does not boast of their own clarity,\nbut lets the eyes of all under heaven see all under heaven—\nthus, *Li Lou* (离娄) could not equal their clarity.\n\n**○ Master Rong said:**\nNot to reveal oneself—thus clarity is attained.\nNot to insist on one’s own views—thus *illumination* (彰) is achieved.\nNot to claim one’s own merits—thus there are *achievements* (功).\nNot to boast—thus one endures.\nTo abandon distinctions and relinquish knowledge,\n*wisdom* (智慧) naturally illuminates.\nTo diminish the *other* (物) and *self* (我) to preserve the *true* (真),\n*virtue/power and Dao/Way* (道德) naturally become manifest.\nTo take merit as one’s own—thus one loses it.\nTo exaggerate one’s own *virtue/power* (德)—thus it does not endure.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary says:**\n*Other* and *self* are both *empty* (空).\nNot to see the *form of one’s own body* (我身相),\nthus *wisdom* (智慧) shines brightly.\n\n**Not to insist on one’s own views—thus *illumination* (彰) is achieved.**\n**御注:** If one does not insist on their own correctness,\nyet bends oneself to extend others,\nthen their *correctness* (是) will naturally become manifest.\n\n**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields uprightness* (枉则直).\nIt says that if one can endure wrongs for others,\nnot to assert or claim correctness for oneself,\nthere will be no blame.\nThus their *uprightness* (直) will naturally become manifest—\nhence, it is said: *thus illumination is achieved*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nThe *Sage* does not insist on their own correctness,\nnor condemn others—\nthus they can illuminate the world.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Self* and *other* are equal.\nNot to assert or deny *self* or *other*—\nthus their *virtue/power* (德) becomes manifest.\n\n**Not to claim one’s own merits—thus there are *achievements* (功).**\n**御注:** If one does not claim or take their own merits,\nthen their *achievements* (功) will return to them.\n\n**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields completeness* (洼则盈).\nIt says that if one does not claim or take their own merits,\nconstantly practicing *humility and yielding* (谦让),\nthen others will not compete,\nand their *achievements* (功) will return to them.\nLike the earth being *strong yet low* (劲下),\nwater will surely *fill and overflow* (盈).\nHence, it is said: *there are achievements*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\n*Claim* (伐) is *take* (取).\nThe *Sage*’s *virtue/power and transformation* (德化) flow and spread,\nyet does not take their own beauty—\nthus they have *achievements* (功) for all under heaven.\n\n**○ Master Yan said:**\n*Claim* (伐) is like *attacking and seizing* (攻伐).\nTo use the *anger of all under heaven* to attack all under heaven—\nthus, *Huangdi* (黄帝) could not equal their *威* (威).\nTo use the *strength of all under heaven* to wage war against all under heaven—\nthus, *Tang* and *Wu* (汤武) could not equal their *achievements* (量功).\nHence, all under heaven can be entrusted to,\nand the *feudal lords* (诸侯) can be subjects after them.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Claim* (伐) is *take* (取).\nThough they *punish and harm* (亭毒) countless beings,\nyet they *sacrifice themselves as mere straw dogs* (刍狗) to the people,\npushing merit onto others—\nthus they have *great achievements* (大功).\n\n**Not to boast—thus one endures.**\n**御注:** If one can constantly guard *privation/deficiency* (弊薄),\nnot boasting or exalting oneself,\nthen others will exalt their *enduring qualities* (长).\n\n**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields renewal* (曲则新).\nIt says that if one can guard *privation/deficiency* (弊薄),\nnot boasting or showing off,\nthen others will surely yield,\nand their *good conduct* (善行) will grow ever longer—\nhence, it is said: *thus one endures*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\n*Boast* (矜) is *great* (大).\n\nThe Sage does not claim greatness for himself,\nthus able to endure long without danger.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nIt is because they push *virtue/power* (德) and *good conduct* (行) onto others,\nso they do not boast or exalt themselves—\nthus their *virtue/power* (德) and *conduct* (行) are enduring and far-reaching.\n\n**Only because they do not contend,**\nthus none under Heaven can contend with them.\n\n**御注:** If one does not contend with others,\nwho will contend with them?\n\n**○御疏:** Only those who practice *bending yields renewal* (曲则新),\n*yielding to preserve wholeness* (全), and similar *Dao/Way* (道),\nall embody *humility and compliance* (委顺), not contending.\nSince *gentleness and weakness* (柔弱) surpass *rigidity and strength* (刚强),\nand *modesty and emptiness* (谦虚) naturally return to *uprightness* (直),\nthen who under Heaven could contend with those who do not contend?\nHence, it is said: *none can contend with them*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nThis speaks of the Sage’s ability to not monopolize *truth* (是),\nwhile the ancients spoke of *crookedness and uprightness* (枉正) being rare—\nnot empty words, but true accounts of *wholeness and preservation* (全理).\nThose who can *yield and comply* (曲从) truly preserve their *form and body* (肌体),\nreturning it to their *parents* (父母),\nand suffer no harm.\n\n**○ Master Yan said:**\nThe shadow follows the form,\nthe echo answers the sound—\nif one does not contend with others,\nwho will contend with them?\n\n**○ Master Rong said:**\nTo assert oneself as right\nand point at others as wrong,\nto not harmonize with people\nbut only to oppose others—\nthis is the origin of contention.\nThe Sage *bends and yields* (屈曲), following others,\n*forgiving wrongs and righting injustices* (豁荡是非),\nnot contending for *merit and fame* (功名),\nand does not compete with others—\nthus, though Heaven is vast,\nwho could contend with them?\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThis is the praise of those who embody the *Four Virtues* (四德),\nprofoundly understanding *conformity and opposition* (违顺),\nusing *modesty* (谦) to nurture themselves,\nnot contending with others—\nthus all beings under Heaven cannot contend with those who do not contend.\nThe fourth section draws upon ancient truths\nto conclude the praise of *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全).\n\nThe ancients spoke of *bending yields renewal* (曲则全)—\nwas this not true?\nIndeed, it is true and returns to oneself.\n\n**御注:** The ancients’ words on *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全)—\nwere these not true?\nThose who truly *yield and comply* (曲) will surely *preserve wholeness* (全).\nThis is the *principle* (理) returning to itself.\n\n**○御疏:** This passage cites ancient words\nto conclude the theme of *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全).\nIt states that from ancient times there were these words on *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全)—\nwere these not true words with real meaning?\nIf one can *yield and comply* (曲顺), not opposing others,\nthen they truly possess *wholeness* (全理),\nreturning it to themselves—\nhence, it is said: *Indeed, it is true and returns to oneself*.\n*Sincerity* (诚) means *truth* (信).\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\nThe ancients spoke of *bending yields renewal* (曲则全)—\nwas this not true?\nThe *transmission* (传) of ancient words\non *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲从则全身)\nand *uprightness* (正) is not empty or false.\n*Indeed, it is true and returns to oneself*—\nthis means they truly possess *wholeness* (全).\nThose who can *yield and comply* (曲从)\ntruly preserve their *form and body* (肌体),\nreturning it to their *parents* (父母),\nand suffer no harm.\n\n**○ Master Rong said:**\nThe Sage does not monopolize *truth* (是).\nThis refers to the ancient practice of *crookedness and uprightness* (枉正) being rare—\nnot empty words, but true accounts of *wholeness and preservation* (全理).\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe ancients spoke of *yielding and compliance* (屈曲柔顺)\nto preserve their *Dao/Way* (道)—\nthis is not empty talk,\nbut truly the words of instruction.\nIf one follows the teachings and practices *modesty*,\nnot contending with others,\nthen they achieve *great and whole virtue* (大成全德),\nall returning to themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 23: Hope in Spontaneity (希言自然)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one\nbecause the prior chapter expounded the *Four Virtues* (四德) of *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全),\nwhile this chapter speaks of *depending on practice* (依修).\nThus, it follows to further clarify all *conducts* (行).\n\nWithin this chapter, there are four layers of meaning:\n1. It clarifies the *teaching of the body* (体教) to *forget words* (忘言),\n   thus able to grasp *principle* (理).\n2. It clarifies the *restless and competitive mind* (执心躁竞),\n   which is why one lacks constancy.\n3. It concludes the attainment of *forgetting words* (忘言之得).\n4. It directly concludes the loss of *holding to teachings* (执教之失).\n\n**1.

How much less can mortals, clinging to words and teachings, harm the Dao and recklessly seek sudden enlightenment? Could they ever attain it?\n\n**御 Citation:**\n*Who* brings about these fickle winds and sudden rains?\nThe heavens and earth.\n\nThe heavens and earth, though most divine, when they combine to produce raging winds and violent rains, cannot even last from morning to evening—how much less can mortals, in their reckless haste, endure?\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Who* brings about this wind and rain?\nIt is the dual forces of heaven and earth, with their mighty creative power. Even their raging winds and sudden rains cannot endure long—how much less can mortals, in their reckless actions, hope to last?\n\n**Third Section:** Those who cultivate the Dao must not cling to words.\n\n**御 Commentary:**\nThus, those who follow the Dao must not cling to fixed words and teachings.\n\n**御 Citation:**\n*From* (顺) means to follow in harmony. The Dao is boundless and unfettered in its operation—when it acts upon things, it flows without obstruction. Therefore, those who would embody its mystery and follow its way must not cling to anything; hence, it is said: *those who follow the Dao.*\n\n**River Above Master (河上公):**\n*From* (为) means to act. Mortals should act in accordance with the Dao’s stillness, not like raging winds and sudden rains.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary (荣曰):**\nThe Dao is pure, effortless, and beneficent—if all actions align with the Dao, the Dao is thereby realized.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*From* means to follow in accordance with. *Things* refers to worldly affairs. It speaks of those of supreme virtue, who in all actions align with principle, who in all things embody the Dao. Thus, they follow worldly affairs while remaining ever empty and responsive—this is the meaning of \"the sage follows only the Dao.\"\n\nThose who attain the Dao do so by aligning with principle in all things, thus merging with the Dao and its wisdom. To attain the Dao is to be one with the Dao.\n\nThose who embody the Dao are one with the Dao,\nThose who embody virtue are one with virtue.\n\n**御 Commentary:**\nThose who embody the Dao forget words and awaken to it—thus, they are one with the Dao.\n\n**御 Citation:**\nThose who follow the Dao in their actions do not become fixed; they transcend words and teachings, unencumbered, and thus are one with the Dao.\n\n**River Above Master (河上公):**\nThose who embody the Dao are those who love the Dao. To be one with the Dao is to be as the Dao itself.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary (荣曰):**\nVirtue nourishes all things and benefits humanity—if mortals act in accord with virtue, virtue is thereby realized.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe Dao is the eternal Way; virtue is the highest virtue. Those who embody teaching and forget words, whose actions align with supreme virtue, naturally resonate with it.\n\nThe Dao is the essence of virtue; virtue is the manifestation of the Dao. Speaking of essence, we say the Dao; speaking of manifestation, we say virtue—hence the two phrases.\n\n**Fourth Section:** Those who cling to teaching fall into error.\n\n**御 Commentary:**\nClinging to words and fixed teachings, they cannot awaken—unawakened, they stray from the Dao, thus becoming one with error.\n\n**御 Citation:**\n*Error* means to lose. Those who cling to words and teachings lose the Dao. Words and teachings are like the tracks of fish and rabbits—those who fixate on the tracks lose sight of the animals themselves. Those who cling to words and teachings lose the subtle truth.\n\nTo lose the subtle truth is to have no path to the Dao—thus, they are one with error.\n\n**River Above Master (河上公):**\n*Error* means to fail oneself and others. To be one with error is to align with failure.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary (荣曰):**\nUnable to act in accord with the Dao and virtue, to preserve benevolence and righteousness while associating with the wicked—this is to share in the guilt of the condemned.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\nReckless competition, clinging to teaching, and generating delusion—when they act, they align with those who lose the way, unable to empty their hearts and merge in darkness. Those who speak of the Dao yet lose it are like those who lose the Dao itself.\n\nAs the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"In past lives, they did not study—now they only lose further.\"*\n\nThose who are one with the Dao, the Dao attains them.\nThose who are one with virtue, virtue attains them.\nThose who are one with error, error attains them.\n\n**御 Commentary:**\nCompare it to holding water—it will flow where it is poured.\nOr to a concave mirror drawing fire—it follows its nature.\nThings of the same kind gather; distinctions are clear—\nthe

produce the bitter and the sweet of Chu and Yue,\nbut harmony in the Dao unites the barbarian and the civilized under one wind.\n\nThings follow their kind without resistance—\nthus, those who align with the Dao draw the Dao’s response,\nand those who align with error invite error’s arrival.\n\n「Just as one holds water to let it flow where it is poured,\nor uses a concave mirror to draw fire—\nthe fire comes naturally.\n\nThus it is said: Those who align with the Dao, the Dao attains them.\n**Master He Shang** said:\nThose who align with the Dao, the Dao attains them—\nthose who harmonize with the Dao, the Dao joyfully attains them.\nThose who align with virtue, virtue attains them—\nthose who harmonize with virtue, virtue joyfully attains them.\nThose who align with error, error attains them—\nthose who harmonize with error, error joyfully attains them.\n\n**Yan** said:\nWhen affairs follow the Dao, the Dao follows affairs.\nWhen affairs follow virtue, virtue follows affairs.\nWhen affairs follow error, error follows affairs.\nWhen faith is insufficient, there arises doubt.\n\n**御 Commentary:**\nClinging to words and being obstructed by teachings,\none cannot awaken to true understanding—\nthis is the insufficiency of faith.\nIf one aligns with error, error joyfully comes—\nthis is the presence of doubt.\n\n**御 Citation:**\nIt speaks of why people cannot embody and verify the truth,\nforgetting words in the process—\nwhen faith and understanding are insufficient, confusion and obstruction arise.\nOnce confusion and obstruction arise,\none clings to words and seeks understanding.\nClinging to words to seek understanding,\none only creates further bewilderment and stumbling—\nthis is the presence of doubt’s response.\nThus it is said: *There arises doubt.*\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\nWhen faith is insufficient, the ruler lacks faith in his subjects.\nWhen there arises doubt, the subjects respond with doubt to the ruler.\nThis illustrates how things of the same kind gather,\nand voices of the same kind resonate—\nclouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger,\nwater flows to the damp, fire turns to the dry.\n\n**Yan** said:\nInsufficient faith refers to the self;\ndoubt arises refers to both humankind and the cosmos.\n\n**Rong** said:\nThose who align with the Dao, the Dao attains them—\nwhen one has faith in the Dao, the Dao attains that person.\nThose who align with error, the Dao abandons them—\nwhen faith is insufficient, doubt arises.\n\n**Cheng’s Citation:**\nUnable to forget words,\nyet clinging to words to seek truth—\nthough one claims to have faith in the Dao,\none’s understanding is still insufficient,\nand thus one clings obstinately to teachings and doctrines,\nfailing to reach the true source.\nThis is the heart of doubt.\n\nTherefore, in the realm of Supreme Mystery,\nthere are those who **stand on tiptoe**—\n*Chapter Twenty-Four: The Chapter of Those Who Stand on Tiptoe,*\nexplaining why this chapter follows the last—\nthe last chapter criticized the restless and competitive,\nthose who clung to erroneous teachings,\nso this chapter further clarifies its meaning.\nWithin this chapter alone,\nthere are three distinct teachings:\nFirst, it illustrates the two confusions of **tiptoeing and striding**,\nclosely following the chapter on sudden rains;\nSecond, it reiterates the four bewilderments,\ncontrasting with the four virtues of *curved fullness* and *complete harmony*;\nThird, it uses analogies to encourage one to abandon such tendencies.\n\n**First: Illustrating the two confusions of tiptoeing and striding, closely following the chapter on sudden rains.**\nWithin the Three Realms,\nonly the sages who adhere to the **Mysterious Origin** are revered.\nWithin the Eightfold Heaven,\nall honor the **authentic teachings of Huang-Lao**.\nThey humble themselves and yield gently,\nneither tiptoeing nor striding,\nborrowing the **mother-qi** to give birth to things,\nand presenting the **father of learning** to teach the ignorant.\nTheir **effortless effort** is grand and pure,\ntheir **clear brightness** is pristine and white—\nlike a well that never runs dry,\nor the boundless sky above.\nGazing upward, it only grows higher—\nhow can it compare to the vast blue?\nIn **nirvana**, they remain unstained,\ncongealing the **pure emptiness** beyond thought,\nyet in the world of dust, they can blend harmoniously,\ndwelling in the **sand realm** while ever serene.\n\nThey lament the **pride in excess** like leftover food,\nand sigh at the **flaunting of clarity** like superfluous adornments.\nSteadfast and unmoving,\ntheir **purple qi** radiates from the **West Pass**,\ntranquil and effortless,\ntheir **white light** is heard in the **Southern Calendar**.\n\nTo know their subtlety,\nthis is what is meant.\n\nThose who **stand on tiptoe** cannot endure,\nthose who **stride arrogantly** cannot proceed.\n\n**御 Commentary:**\n**Standing on tiptoe** means lifting one’s heels to gaze afar.\n**Striding** means clinging to things to surpass others.\nWhat analogy better illustrates\nthose who vainly seek enlightenment—\ntheir clarity never obtained—\nthan the one who stands on tiptoe, unable to endure long,\nor strides, yet cannot move forward?\nFor **tiptoeing** makes one unstable,\nand **striding** obstructs one’s path—\njust as in the following lines,\n*self-perception leads to blindness*,\n*self-righteousness obscures truth*.\n\nThus it is clear:\n**Tiptoeing** cannot endure,\n**striding** cannot proceed,\n**self-perception** cannot bring clarity,\n**self-righteousness** cannot reveal truth.\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\nThose who **tiptoe** cannot endure—\n**tiptoeing** means advancing.\nIt refers to those who covet power and fame,\npursuing功名 (*official status and glory*)—\nsuch advancement cannot last in body or Dao.\n\nThose who **stride arrogantly** cannot proceed—\nthey consider themselves noble,\nyet **stride over others**,\nand the crowd scorns them,\npreventing their progress.\n\n**Rong** said:\n**Striding** means surpassing.\nSlow and measured steps endure long,\nbut **tiptoeing and striding** over others—\nsuch progress cannot last.\nThis illustrates that those who practice humility, modesty, and yielding\ncan endure and flourish,\nwhile those who **tiptoe and stride in pride**\ninvite their own ruin.\n\n**Cheng’s Citation:**\nThose who **tiptoe** cannot endure long—\n**tiptoeing** means coveting and emulating.\nThe restless and competitive,\ntheir hearts not harboring the Dao,\ncannot uphold authenticity or preserve simplicity,\nyet they covet external desires.\nBut things have their inherent nature,\nand such desires cannot be attained by **tiptoeing**.\nHaving abandoned their Dao,\nhow can they endure long?\n\nThose who **stride arrogantly** cannot proceed—\n**striding** means prideful arrogance.\nPractitioners of the Dao must be humble and modest,\nyet if they **stride over others in pride**,\ntaking this as their aspiration,\nthey cannot proceed on the Dao.\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The eagle and the falcon rest while the carp and the kite tire themselves out in striding,\"*\nand again:\n*\"Power and influence are short-lived,\nso the boastful will weep.\"*\n\n「○ *Rong* says: Those who seek self-clarity are blind,\nthose who insist on their own right are not illuminated,\nthose who boast of their own merit achieve nothing,\nthose who vaunt their own virtue do not endure long.\nThis is not the conduct of a true gentleman—\nhow can it be the way of one who forgets himself?\n\n○ *Cheng*’s commentary: Unable to forget oneself,\none sees only one’s own body,\nwhich is the mark of stupidity, not wisdom.\nThose who insist on their own right are not illuminated.\n\n○ *Yu*’s annotation: To stubbornly uphold one’s own views while rejecting others,\nand to boast of one’s superiority as if seeking fame,\nis to invite universal censure.\nThus, one’s virtue remains obscured,\nand one cannot shine.\n\n○ *He Shang Gong* says: When one insists on one’s own appearance as good,\nand on one’s own actions as conforming to the Dao,\none fails to recognize that one’s appearance is actually ugly,\nand one’s conduct is base.\n\n○ *Rong* says: Those who boast of their own merit achieve nothing,\nfor they lack the virtue of humility and the practice of yielding.\nIf one abandons this Way,\nthere is no path to success—\nhow much more so when one arrogantly claims merit and strives for glory,\nonly to invite contention and squander one’s achievements?\nThus it is said: those who boast of their own merit achieve nothing.\n\n○ *He Shang Gong* says: Those who habitually claim their own right\nand constantly speak ill of others\nwill find their virtue obscured by all.\n\n○ *Cheng*’s commentary: Those who vaunt their own grandeur,\noverbearing and arrogant toward all,\nare short-sighted and foolish—\nhow can their virtue endure long?\n\n○ *Yan* says: Before the masses have stirred,\nbefore the realm has responded,\nto raise arms in war is to lose the Way of the ruler.\nThe Way of wielding arms is to lose the ruler’s timing—\nthe people’s resentment grows,\nthe celestial order is disturbed,\nthe ancestral temples face peril,\nand one’s life ends with no merit.\n\n○ *Cheng*’s commentary: Whenever one acts,\none boasts of one’s own merit,\nand all things recoil in aversion—\nthus one achieves no lasting glory.\n\n○ *Rong* says: Residual leftovers are unfit for ancestral offerings,\nboastful conduct is unfit for advancing the Dao.\nThe confused love such conduct as correct,\nwhile the enlightened despise it as false—\nthus they do not cherish it.\n\n○ *Cheng*’s commentary: In the Dao, one speaks of residual leftovers and parasitic growths—\nresidual leftovers are like spoiled food,\nparasitic growths are like harmful excrescences.\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Hanging warts and parasitic growths—\nthey protrude from the body and exceed its nature,\nand all things may detest them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\"*\nThis refers to those who seek self-clarity and insist on their own right—\ntheir conduct in the Dao is like spoiled food and parasitic growths,\nwhich all things detest.\nParasitic growths are useless flesh,\nboastful conduct is useless action—\nall beings in the world abhor their sight.\nThus, those who cherish the Dao\nwould never fix their minds on such parasitic, boastful ways.\n\n---\n*End of Volume Six of the *Dao De Zheng Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue) – Commentary by Master *Cheng*\n*Beginning of Volume Seven of the *Dao De Zheng Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue) – Compiled Commentary*」\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: *The Chapter of the Undifferentiated Essence***\n\n*This chapter follows the previous one,*\n*for the prior spoke broadly of boastful pride,*\n*urging one to shun such tastes.*\n*Thus, this chapter is placed next,*\n*revealing the true nature of the Dao,*\n*to inspire beings to cultivate.*\n\n*Teaching and prescribing methods*\n*must first diagnose the ailment,*\n*then offer the remedy.*\n*The remedy confronts the disease—*\n*this is why the chapter follows.*\n\n*Now, this chapter unfolds in five themes:*\n*First, revealing the Dao’s true nature,*\n*transcending all form and sound;*\n*Second, clarifying its original namelessness,*\n*then establishing names through its manifestations;*\n*Third, guiding beings toward its path,*\n*returning them to their root and origin;*\n*Fourth, citing the Four Great Elements within the realm,*\n*to show beings how to align their cultivation;*\n*Fifth, illustrating the shallow’s path to depth,*\n*gradually ascending to the ultimate perfection.*\n\n---\n\n**First: Revealing the Dao’s True Nature, Transcending All Form and Sound.**\n\n*There is an Essence that coalesces without distinction,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth arise,*\n*the primordial *qi* that enfolds all things,*\n*exceeding the workings of *造化* (Creation and Transformation) in its function.*\n*Its essence is profound and still,*\n*quiet and solitary, standing alone.*\n*Though its goodness is vast,*\n*we force upon it a name—*\n*thus things are born,*\n*and we call it *Dao/Way*.*\n*At the Jade Pool’s fleeting gathering,*\n*some hear the *Huangzhu* (Yellow Bamboo) hymn,*\n*while in the *dongling* (caverns and peaks) others encounter*\n*the scent of white *mao* (grass).*\n\n*Its passing is distant,*\n*its essence is true.*\n*The Twelve Sovereigns honor the Nameless Lord,*\n*and the Five Thousand Words proclaim it as the Mother of All Things.*\n*The Dao of Nature—*\n*what need has Heaven of speech?*\n\n*There is an Essence that coalesces without distinction,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth arise.*\n*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*\n*To explain why the Dao is named,*\n*it speaks of \"an Essence.\"*\n*The Essence coalesces without distinction,*\n*encompassing all things.*\n*Tracing its transformation,*\n*one finds it precedes Heaven and Earth.*\n*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*\n*\"An Essence\" refers to the wondrous Essence,*\n*the very *虚极* (Ultimate Void) and *妙本* (Profound Origin).*\n*To further clarify why names are imposed,*\n*yet the Dao cannot be directly called,*\n*it says, \"There is this wondrous Essence.\"*\n*Coalescing without distinction,*\n*it enfolds all phenomena.*\n*Tracing its transformation,*\n*one finds it precedes Heaven and Earth—*\n*thus, it is said to exist before Heaven and Earth arise.*\n\n*[Master He Shang Gong] said:*\n*The Dao is formless, like the undifferentiated *混沌* (Chaos),*\n*yet it gives birth to all things,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth.*\n\n*[Master Li Rong] said:*\n*\"An Essence\" is the Dao.*\n*Though named *Dao/Way*,*\n*the Dao as Essence*\n*is but a fleeting glimpse,*\n*a hazy vision—*\n*it cannot be discussed in terms of presence or absence,*\n*nor distinguished by yin and yang.*\n*Coalescing without distinction,*\n*it forms all things naturally.*\n*Thus, it is called *混成* (Undifferentiated Coalescence).*\n*The Dao’s natural principle*\n*operates through transformation and change,*\n*its formless depths*\n*unfold through the *qi* of phenomena.*\n*Its origin precedes Heaven and Earth—*\n*thus, it is said to exist before their birth.*\n\n*[Master Cheng’s Commentary]:*\n*\"An Essence\" is the Dao.*\n*It clarifies that the Dao, though called \"having,\"*\n*is not truly a thing,*\n*and though called \"an Essence,\"*\n*it is not truly material.*\n*Undifferentiated yet capable of giving birth to all things,*\n*it is also said to be not mixed yet mixed,*\n*though mixed, it coalesces,*\n*though coalesced, it remains undifferentiated.*\n*Though undifferentiated, it coalesces,*\n*though coalesced, it remains undifferentiated—*\n*this is the Dao of Undifferentiated Coalescence,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth,*\n*yet neither prior nor posterior,*\n*neither giving birth nor being born.*\n*Thus, the *Zhuangzi* says:*\n*\"The Spirit Sovereign, the Ghost Sovereign,*\n*give birth to Heaven and Earth,\"*\n*and also:*\n*\"It exists before Heaven and Earth,*\n*yet is not called the Old One.\"*\n\n*Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,*\n*circulates endlessly without exhaustion,*\n*and may be called the Mother of all things.*\n\n*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*\n*The nature of \"An Essence\" is silent and vast,*\n*its profound origin ever still and tranquil.*\n*Thus, it stands alone unchanging.*\n*Its influence permeates all beings,*\n*so it circulates endlessly without peril.*\n*All things draw from it to be born and formed,*\n*receiving its nurturing and flourishing virtue—*\n*thus, it may be called the Mother of all things.*\n\n*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*\n*\"Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,\"*\n*—this sighs at the nature of \"An Essence,\"*\n*silent and vast, its profound origin ever still and tranquil,*\n*thus standing alone without alteration.*\n*All things respond to it inevitably,*\n*yet its response is without intent,*\n*permeating all beings—*\n*thus, it circulates endlessly without peril.*\n\n*\"It may be called the Mother of all things,\"*\n*—its profound origin gives birth and transforms,*\n*permeating all beings.*\n*All things under Heaven*\n*are none but its crafted forms,*\n*and all creatures receive its flourishing nurturing virtue—*\n*thus, it may rightly be called the Mother of all things.*\n*The Mother’s meaning lies in its nurturing virtue.*\n\n*[Master He Shang Gong] said:*\n*\"Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging—*\n*Silent means without sound,*\n*Vast means formless emptiness.*\n*Standing alone means without pair or equal,*\n*Unchanging means transformation has constancy.\"*\n\n*[Master Li Rong] said:*\n*The Dao of Undifferentiated Coalescence,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth,*\n*when listened to, is inaudible—*\n*thus, it is silent and vast without echo.*\n*When grasped, it cannot be held—*\n*thus, it is formless and boundless.*\n*It lacks a counterpart,*\n*so it is said to stand alone.*\n*Ever profound and unceasing,*\n*thus, it is said to be unchanging.*\n*It is nowhere absent,*\n*thus, it circulates endlessly.*\n*Its application is without effort,*\n*thus, it is without peril.*\n*It nurtures and shelters all living things—*\n*this is the meaning of \"Mother.\"*\n\n*[Master Cheng’s Commentary]:*\n*\"Silent and vast, standing alone unchanging—*\n*Silent means without sound,*\n*Vast means formless.*\n*Standing alone means without reliance on another.*\n*Unchanging means without alteration or drift.*\n*The Dao’s nature is deep and mysterious,*\n*its form and sound utterly transcended.*\n*Since it lacks dependence,*\n*it neither alters nor is altered.*\n*This is the meaning of*\n*—**独独非待独* (Truly solitary, without reliance, truly alone).*\n*The Dao is nowhere absent,*\n*thus its circulation is endless.*\n*Wherever it is, all is penetrated—*\n*thus, it is without peril.*\n*It opens yin and yang,*\n*stabilizes Heaven and Earth,*\n*nurtures all phenomena,*\n*and nurtures sentient beings,*\n*giving birth and sheltering them—*\n*thus, it may be called the Mother.*\n\n---\n\n**Second: Clarifying the Original Namelessness, Then Establishing Names Through Its Manifestations.**\n\n*I do not know its name;*\n*it is called *Dao/Way*.*\n*We force upon it the name *Great*.*\n\n*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*\n*I see its Essence giving birth to all things,*\n*hidden without a name,*\n*so I use \"universal birth\" to mark its virtue,*\n*and call it *Dao/Way*.*\n*To encompass its entirety,*\n*I force upon it the name *Great*.*\n\n*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*\n*By \"calling it,\" we mark its virtue,*\n*by \"naming it,\" we define its essence.*\n\nThe Venerable Lord Lao says:\n*\"The wondrous origin gives birth and transforms,*\n*its boundless application knows no end,*\n*silent, empty, and tranquil—*\n*its form cannot be fixed.*\n\n*It precedes Heaven and Earth in birth,*\n*its lineage is beyond speech.*\n\n*Thus, I do not know its name,*\n*but seeing its boundless penetration,*\n*I mark its virtue of universal birth*\n*and call it **Dao/Way**.*\n\n*Seeing it encompass all without limit,*\n*I seek to define its ultimate, boundless essence,*\n*and thus force upon it the name **Great**.*\n\n*All things first receive a name, then a character,*\n*for they grow from small to great.*\n*But **Dao/Way** first receives a character, then a name,*\n*for it descends from its origin to its traces.*\n\n---\n*The Master of the Yellow River says:*\n*\"I do not know its name,*\n*so I call it **Dao/Way**.*\n*I do not see the form of **Dao/Way**,*\n*and do not know how to name it.*\n*Seeing all things arise from **Dao/Way**,*\n*I call it **Dao/Way**.*\n\n*I force upon it the name **Great**—*\n*unknown yet named, thus called *strong naming*.*\n\n*Greatness is high and without surpass,*\n*expansive and without boundary,*\n*encompassing all without exclusion—*\n*thus, it is called **Great**.\"*\n\n---\n*Honor says:*\n*\"That which has form is named,*\n*that which has no likeness is transcended.*\n*The name **Dao/Way** is marked by its virtue of universal birth and function,*\n*encompassing all without exception—*\n*thus, it is named **Great**.*\n\n*Its principle is originally nameless,*\n*yet named—*\n*this is called *strong naming*.\"*\n\n---\n*The Commentary of Cheng says:*\n*\"I do not know its name,*\n*so I call it **Dao/Way**.*\n***Dao/Way** is originally nameless,*\n*incapable of being grasped by intellect.*\n*The name **Dao/Way** is as in the first chapter: *‘The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.’*\n\n*Taking its virtue of universal birth,*\n*I call it **Dao/Way**—*\n*as in the first chapter: *‘The named is the Mother of all things.’*\n\n*I force upon it the name **Great**,*\n*for its body knows no bounds—*\n*thus, it is called *strong naming*.*\n\n*By naming the body and marking with the character,*\n***Dao/Way** is its function,*\n***Great** is its essence—*\n*thus, it is named **Great** and marked **Dao/Way**.*\n\n*All others name first, then mark,*\n*but here, marking comes before naming—*\n*to invert **Dao/Way** from the common.*\n\n*Thus, different yet the same,*\n*having both right and mark,*\n*same yet different,*\n*marking before naming.\"*\n\n---\n**Third: Guiding Things to Their Directions, Returning to the Root and Origin.**\n\n*The **Great** departs,*\n*The departing is distant,*\n*The distant returns.*\n\n*The Emperor’s Annotation:*\n*\"Its wondrous function knows no fixed direction,*\n*and forced naming cannot contain it.*\n*Seeking it from **Great**, it departs and goes.*\n*Seeking it from its going, it is distant and unattained.*\n*If one can awaken to this, then its return lies within the body and mind to be verified.\"*\n\n---\n*The Emperor’s Commentary:*\n*\"To be fixed in one direction*\n*is not the ultimate penetration of the world.*\n\n*Thus, Heaven’s role is to cover and nurture,*\n*yet it cannot bear form,*\n*Earth’s role is to bear form,*\n*yet it cannot cover and nurture.*\n*Only the wondrous origin’s function*\n*has no fixed direction—*\n*though named **Great**, it cannot be sustained by **Greatness**.*\n\n*Seeking it from **Great**, it departs and goes.*\n*Seeking it from its going, it is distant and unattained.\"*\n\n「Seeking it from the distant,\nthen it returns within the human body and mind—\nthus it is called *far* and *return*.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"The Dao/Way does not terminate at the **Great**,\nnor does it neglect the **small**.\"*\n\n*River Upper Master* says:\n*\"When called **Great**, it passes.\nIts greatness is not like Heaven’s constant presence above,\nnor like Earth’s constant presence below—\nrather, it passes away to places without constancy.\nWhen it passes, it is distant—\nthe distant extends to the boundless,\nits *qi* permeating Heaven and Earth,\nreaching everywhere without obstruction.\nWhen distant, it returns—\nthis means its distance does not sever itself utterly,\nbut rather returns within the human body and mind.\"*\n\n*Rong* says:\n*\"Passing\" means \"going.\"\nIf one seeks it from the **Great** but cannot attain its going,\nor follows its going but cannot catch up to its distance,\nthen its essence is near within the body—\nthus it is called *return*.\"*\n\n*Master Cheng’s commentary* states:\n*\"When called **Great**, it passes—\npassing means going.\nWith great power, its function can guide all beings,\nleading them to the realm of the Sage.\nWhen it passes, it is distant—\nascending beyond the Three Realms,\ndistant in its attainment of the Three Pure Ones.\nWhen distant, it returns—\nreturning means returning.\nHaving perfected the Dao/Way of self-benefit,\nit returns to the realm of the Sage,\nmercifully rescuing all sentient beings.\nAlternatively interpreted:\nWhen lost in delusion, the Three Pure Ones are seen as the Three Realms,\nbut upon awakening, the Three Realms are the Three Pure Ones—\nthus its return lies within the mundane dust,\nwhich is the Great Void above.\n\nThe fourth illustration presents the Four Great Elements within the domain,\nordering things to conform to their nature.\nThus, the Dao/Way is **Great**, Heaven is **Great**, Earth is **Great**,\nand the Sovereign too is **Great**.\n\n*The Emperor’s Commentary* states:\n*\"By clarifying what each **Great** refers to,\none attains the unity of Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign.\nHeaven’s **Greatness** lies in its covering,\nEarth’s **Greatness** lies in its bearing,\nThe Sovereign’s **Greatness** lies in its ability to emulate Earth and Heaven,\nthus following the Dao/Way—\nhence it is also called **Great**.\"*\n\n*The Emperor’s Expanded Commentary* states:\n*\"Though the Dao/Way is named **Great** by force,\nit illustrates the next **Great** things in order:\nHeaven can invert the mysterious and abide above,\nhanging its cover over all things;\nEarth can solidify and remain below,\nthickly bearing all things;\nThe Sovereign can maintain clarity and stillness, doing nothing,\nyet transforming all things—\nthese are the Three **Great** ones.\nMy Dao/Way unifies them all.\"*\n\n*River Upper Master* says:\n*\"The **Greatness** of the Dao/Way is that it contains all things,\nencompassing all the Heavens and the Earth.\nHeaven’s **Greatness** is that it covers all without exception.\nEarth’s **Greatness** is that it bears all without exception.\nThe Sovereign’s **Greatness** is that it governs all without exception.\"*\n\n*Rong* says:\n*\"The Dao/Way is noble and virtue/power is precious,\nits net extends without limit.\nHeaven can broadly cover,\nwithout distinction between high and low;\nEarth can thickly bear,\nwithout preference for beauty or ugliness;\nThe Sovereign can control,\npenetrating far and near,\nnurturing all equally among the poor and rich—\neach has its own function,\nthus it is called **Great**.\"*\n\n*Master Cheng’s commentary* states:\n*\"The Dao/Way’s **Greatness** is that it encompasses all;\nHeaven’s **Greatness** is that it covers all;\nEarth’s **Greatness** is that it bears all;\nThe Sovereign’s **Greatness** is that it governs all.\nWithin the domain are the Four **Great** ones,\nwhile the Sovereign occupies one among them.\n\n*The Emperor’s Commentary* states:\n*\"The Sovereign is the master of human spirit,\nall things depend on his rise and fall.\nTo extend his warnings and admonitions,\nit is said that the Sovereign resides among the Four **Great** ones—\nthis is to urge the Sovereign to follow the Dao/Way naturally.\"*\n\n*The Emperor’s Expanded Commentary* states:\n*\"Domain\" refers to limitation.\nNow when it speaks of the **Great** within the domain,\nthe Dao/Way is not confined solely within the domain.\nIf one speaks of it in terms of what is visible,\nthen Heaven and Earth themselves form a domain,\nyet they are not solely within the domain either.\n\nThe ancient words are used to expound profound principles,\nnot necessarily to force strange interpretations.\nThe text is preserved to prevent doubts and difficulties,\nyet all interpretations fail to fully grasp it.\n\nNow, when clarifying \"domain,\" it is a name—\na name for a limited realm.\nThings have no form beyond their names,\nthus it is called *domain*.\nIf one speaks of the Dao/Way’s name,\nthen the Dao/Way is within it;\nif one speaks of Heaven’s name,\nthen Heaven’s form is not neglected—\nthus it is called *domain*.\nWithin the realm of names,\nthese Four **Great** ones are spoken of,\nand the Sovereign, as the chief of human spirit,\nresides among them.\nWith the Dao/Way, all beings receive its virtue/power;\nwithout the Dao/Way, Heaven and Earth suffer its harm—\nthus it is especially noted that the Sovereign resides among them,\nto urge the Sovereign to follow the Dao/Way naturally.\"*\n\n*River Upper Master* says:\n*\"Within the Eight Extremes there are the Four Great Elements,\nand the Sovereign occupies one among them.\nYan* says: \"Their functions and virtues/powers are the same.\"*\n\n*Rong* says:\n*\"Beyond the world’s circumference,\nwords may cease,\nbut within its forms,\nnames should be applied.\nThough the net is complete,\nwhen examining all phenomena,\nonly the Four Great Elements exist.\nThe name **Great** being unified,\nits functions are difficult to distinguish—\nit exhorts the Emperor to embrace the model of Daoist virtue/power,\nand take Heaven and Earth as his standard.\"*\n\n*Master Cheng’s commentary* states:\n*\"Within the realm of phenomena,\nthese Four **Great** ones exist.\nThe Sovereign possesses the virtue/power of transformation and influence,\nthus it follows the Two Principles and occupies one among them.\nThe Zhuangzi says:\n*The Dao/Way has never been confined by boundaries*—\nyet this text speaks of *domain*—\nit means that though confined by domain,\nthe Dao/Way is not confined by domain,\nand though not confined by domain,\nit is confined by domain—\nthis is the meaning of *domain*.\nThough confined by domain,\nit encompasses all without limit.\n\nThe fifth illustration shows how the shallow becomes deep,\ngradually ascending to the Perfect Dao/Way.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao/Way,\nThe Dao/Way follows Nature.\n\n*The Emperor’s Commentary* states:\n*\"Humans\" refers to the Sovereign,\nwho as ruler must first follow Earth’s stillness.\nHaving done so, he must then follow Heaven’s movement and transformation.\nHaving transformed and created,\nhe must then follow the Dao/Way’s clarity and stillness,\ndoing nothing to let things transform of themselves.\nIf the human ruler can do this,\nthen he unites with the Dao/Way’s following of Nature.*\n\n*The Emperor’s Expanded Commentary* states:\n*\"Humans\" refers to the Sovereign,\nand it is said \"humans\" because humans can follow Heaven and Earth’s creation,\nfollow the Dao/Way’s clarity and stillness,\nand thus all under Heaven will turn toward him—\nthis is why he is called the Sovereign.\nIf the Sovereign does not act thus,\nthen things have nowhere to turn—\nthus \"humans\" is mentioned to warn him.\n\nAs a Sovereign, he must first follow Earth’s stillness,\nand from that stillness,\nhe must then follow Heaven’s transformation and influence,\nand his virtue/power will extend to all things.\nAgain, he must follow the Dao/Way’s clarity and stillness,\ndoing nothing,\nforgetting his own influence over things,\nand letting them transform of themselves.\nIf the human ruler can do this,\nthen he unites with the Dao/Way’s following of Nature.\nIt is said that the Dao/Way’s following of Nature is not merely imitating Nature’s following of itself.\n\nIf one is confused and cannot follow the Dao/Way’s example in Nature,\nthen there are Five **Great** ones within the domain,\nnot Four.*\"*\n\n---\n*Annotations:*\n*Yan: Likely refers to a figure named Yan, possibly Yan Hui (顏回), a famous disciple of Confucius, or another commentator in the Daoist tradition.\n*This text is from the *Taoist Canon* (道藏), specifically the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* (周易参同契), a Daoist alchemical text.\n\n「Again, it cites the *Xisheng Jing* (《西升经》): The **Voidlessness** (虚无) gives rise to **Nature** (自然), **Nature** (自然) generates the **Dao/Way** (道), and the **Dao/Way** (道) is thus called the **Voidlessness’s** (虚无) grandchild and **Nature’s** (自然) son.\nTo falsely establish precedence and hierarchy,\nto block the source and uproot the root,\nto invert the order—how profound the error!\nLet me attempt to explain:\n**Voidlessness** (虚无) is the **Mystic Root’s** (妙本) essence,\nan essence that is not a tangible thing—hence **Voidlessness** (虚无).\n**Nature** (自然) is the **Mystic Root’s** (妙本) inherent disposition,\na disposition without contrivance—hence **Nature** (自然).\nThe **Dao/Way** (道) is the **Mystic Root’s** (妙本) function and manifestation,\nso-called **\"Strengthening the Right\"** (强右),\nyet nothing but universal generation—hence it is called the **Dao/Way** (道).\nIn brief, by naming essence and manifestation,\nit is called the **Dao/Way** (道) of **Voidlessness** (虚无) and **Nature** (自然).\nSeeking its origin,\nit is but the **One Mystic Root** (一妙本),\nso what else could one imitate or follow?\nThus, the difficulty of those who are confused\nlies in their failure to grasp the **Profound Key** (玄键).\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong** (河上公) says:\nHumans should follow the Earth (地),\nand humans ought to follow the Earth’s stillness and yielding softness (安静和柔).\nThey reap the Five Grains (五谷) and dig sweet springs (甘泉),\nlaboring without complaint,\nacting with purpose yet not claiming the merit.\n\nThe Earth follows the Heaven (天),\nas Heaven is vast and tranquil, unmoving (澹泊不动),\nbestowing without seeking recompense,\nnurturing all things,\nyet taking nothing in return.\n\nHeaven follows the **Dao/Way** (道),\nas the **Dao/Way** (道) follows clarity and stillness (清静),\nnot speaking of yin and yang (阴阳),\nyet circulating the **Refined Qi** (精气) to let all things form of themselves.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** (道) follows **Nature** (自然),\nas the **Dao/Way’s** (道) inherent disposition is **Nature** (自然),\nand it follows nothing else.\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nFor the ruler of men (人主),\nstillness (静) shares the **virtue/power** (德) of yin (阴),\nits burden is without partiality (无私),\nfollowing the Earth (地).\n\nAction (动) aligns with the **virtue/power** (波) of yang (阳),\nits **covering** (覆) is impartial and just (公正),\nfollowing Heaven (天).\n\nClarity and **Voidlessness** (虚) with **non-action** (无为),\ncirculating without obstruction (不滞),\nall movement in accordance with principle (合理),\nfollowing the **Dao/Way** (道).\n\nThe **Sage** (圣人) has no desires (无欲),\nnot dwelling in affairs (有事),\nemptying himself to sever all **scheming** (经营),\nentrusting things to their **spontaneous transformation** (独化),\nfollowing **Nature** (自然).\n\nThis is following the **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth (天地),\nnot Heaven and Earth following one another.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):\nHumans (人) are rulers (主),\nso the **Sage** (王) must follow the Earth’s stillness (安静),\nand stillness is the first step in conduct (静为行先),\nfixed resolve can generate benevolence (定能生惠).\nHence the next chapter states: *\"Agitation leads to loss of rule\"* (躁则失君).\nOnce still like the Earth (地),\none must next follow Heaven’s clarity and **Voidlessness** (清虚),\nnurturing all without partiality (无私).\n\nHeaven has the Three Lights (三光),\nsymbolizing how humans have benevolent illumination (惠照),\nEarth is the gateway to **stillness** (定门),\nHeaven is the gateway to benevolence (惠门).\n\nOnce one can emulate Heaven (天),\none must next follow the **Dao/Way’s** (道) clarity and **Voidlessness** (虚通),\nencompassing all things.\n\nOnce one can emulate the **Dao/Way** (道),\none must next follow the **profound principles** (妙理) of **Nature** (自然),\nthe realm of the **Double Mystery** (重玄).\n\nThe **Dao/Way** (道) is the **advancement** (进),\n**Nature** (自然) is the **Root** (本),\nand by the **Root** (本) absorbing the **advancement** (迹),\nthus the meaning of \"following\" (法).\nAgain, it is explained:\nThe **Dao/Way’s** (道) inherent disposition is **Nature** (自然),\nand it follows nothing else—\nits essence transcends all cultivation and learning (体绝修学),\nhence it is said to follow **Nature** (自然).\n\n**Double Mystery** (重玄) is the **root of the light** (轻根) in Chapter Twenty-Six.\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the reason this chapter follows the previous one:\nthe previous chapter expounds how humans should follow the Earth (地),\nand demonstrates that for those who seek the **Dao/Way** (道),\nstillness is the first principle (静为先).\nHence this chapter follows,\nto weigh and measure stillness against agitation (校量静躁).\n\nWithin this chapter, there are three layers of meaning:\nFirst, it correctly distinguishes the inferiority of **lightness and agitation** (轻躁)\nand the superiority of **stillness** (静).\nSecond, it explains that one who upholds **stillness** (重静) will not act contrary to **tranquility** (寂).\nThird, it reveals that those who are **light and agitated** (轻躁) will meet ruin in state and person (亡国丧身).\n\nFirst, it correctly distinguishes the inferiority of **lightness and agitation** (轻躁) and the superiority of **stillness** (静).\nThe great **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth is **generation** (日生),\nthe great treasure of the **Sage** (圣人) is **proper rule** (日位).\nStillness governs movement (静以制动),\nas the thirty spokes revolve around the hub (三十辐之循环),\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nand the **Nine-Five Sovereign** (九五君) embodies its perfect manifestation (端委).\n\nAscending the **Great Peak** (太山) is vast and grand,\nreturning to the myriad hills (众阜) is high,\nwearing the **Jade of Perfection** (玉宸) is for rule (为君),\ngrasping the common people’s reins (握庶人之纪).\n\nThus, it is known:\nwhen the six lines are set,\nthe upper one governs the myriad forms (上一制之於群象),\nand the initial division of the eight lines (八有初分),\nthe lower five stabilize the myriad positions (下五镇之於众位).\n\nHence, the **Profound Mirror** (玄鉴) is distant and wondrous,\nonly stillness and clarity (唯静与清) can reveal it.\nThe **Yellow Palace** (黄屋) holds its august dignity,\nonly the high and the great (唯高唯大) can embody it.\nThe **Sage** (圣人) opens his principles,\nwhich can be discerned in detail.\n\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nand **stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君).\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong’s Commentary** (河上公曰):\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nso if the human ruler does not uphold **Double Mystery** (重),\nhe will not be revered (不尊).\nIf one does not uphold **Double Mystery** (重) in governing his body (治身),\nhe will lose his **spirit** (神).\nGrasses and trees have **light** (轻) flowers and leaves,\nso they wither and fall,\nbut their **roots** (重) are heavy (重),\nso they endure and persist (长存).\n\n**Stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君),\nso if the human ruler is not still (不静),\nhe will lose his **awe** (威).\nIf one does not uphold **stillness** (静) in governing his body (治身),\nhis body will be in danger (身危).\nThe **Dragon** (龙) is still, so it can transform (变),\nthe **Tiger** (虎) is agitated, so it meets early demise (夭亏).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nBoth great and small are **light** (轻),\nyet they cannot serve as **roots** (根本).\nBoth high and low are agitated (躁),\nyet how can they serve as **lords** (君主)?\nThus, one **light** (轻) and one **heavy** (重),\nthe **light** (轻) takes the **heavy** (重) as its **root** (根).\nOne agitated (躁) and one still (静),\nthe agitated takes the still as its **master** (主).\n\nHence, those who uphold **non-action** (无为) and **heavy stillness** (重静) embody the **virtue/power** (德) of rule (为君),\nand those who uphold **action** (有为) and **light agitation** (轻躁) fulfill the duties of subjects (臣之事).\n\nThe high and low each attend to their own affairs (各司其业),\nand for the ruler (为君),\n**heavy stillness** (重静) is essential.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nan analogy like a tree’s **root** (根) being **heavy** (重),\nand its flowers and leaves **light** (轻).\nThe **light** (轻) withers and falls,\nwhile the **heavy** (重) endures and persists (长存).\n\nThis warns learners not to be **light and agitated** (轻躁),\nhence the *Book of Documents* (《书》) states:\n*\"A gentleman who is not **heavy** (重) will not command **awe** (威).\"*\n\n**Stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君),\nas stillness is **non-action** (无为),\nand agitation is **desire** (有欲).\n**Desire** (有欲) brings death (生死),\n**non-action** (无为) brings endurance (长存).\nStillness can govern movement (静能制动),\nhence it is for rule (为君).\n\nSecond, it explains that one who upholds **heavy stillness** (重静)\nwill not act contrary to **tranquility** (寂).\nThus, the **gentleman** (君子) moves all day,\nyet never departs from his **burden** (辎重).»\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\n*\"Zhī\"* (辎) means \"chariot\" (车).\n*\"Zhòng\"* (重) refers to the things it carries.\nThose who are **light and agitated** (轻躁) must uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),\njust as travelers must guard their **burden** (辎重).\nThus, losing the **burden** (辎重) leads to cold and hunger (冻馁),\nwhile indulging in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁) brings disaster (祸乱).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**\n*\"Jūnzǐ\"* (君子) refers to the sovereign (人主),\nspeaking of how his **virtue** (德) can govern the people (人物),\nhence it is called *\"jūnzǐ\"* (君子).\n*\"Zhī\"* (辎) means \"screened carriage\" (屏车),\n*\"zhòng\"* (重) refers to the things it carries—this is a metaphor.\nIt says the sovereign must always uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),\njust as travelers never abandon their **burden** (辎重).\nIf travelers lose their **burden** (辎重),\nthey will have nothing to sustain them,\nand they must suffer cold and hunger (冻馁).\nIf the sovereign indulges in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁),\nhis ministers will scatter,\nhe will breed calamities (息祸),\nand his state will fall—\nhence it is said that the sovereign moves all day yet never abandons his **burden** (辎重).\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**\n*\"Zhī\"* (辎) means **stillness** (静).\nThe **sage** (圣人) moves through the **Dao/Way** (道) all day,\nyet never abandons **stillness** (静) and **heavy stillness** (重).\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nA sovereign who upholds the **Dao/Way** (道),\ngoverning the people (物),\nmust strive for **heavy stillness** (重静)\nand not indulge in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁).\nEvery action must not stray from the **Dao/Way** (道),\nevery movement must not abandon **stillness** (静).\nThus, when he travels, he must carry his **burden** (辎重),\nand when he resides, he must maintain his **defenses** (摄卫).\nThis prevents ruin (危亡),\nall from **heavy stillness** (重静).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**\nHence, it continues the earlier warning and adds new meaning.\n*\"Zhī\"* (辎) means **stillness** (静).\nIt says the sovereign, who understands humanity (达人),\nmoves through the world all day (终日行化),\nyet never abandons **heavy stillness** (重静).\nThis is the meaning of \"moving yet tranquil\" (动而寂).\nEven amid splendor (荣观),\nhe remains detached (超然).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nThe sovereign must uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),\nso even amid splendor (荣观),\nhe must rest content (燕尔安处),\ndetached (超然) and unmoved.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**\nIf the sovereign upholds **heavy stillness** (重静),\nthe people will not be burdened with labor (烦劳).\nIf he indulges in high platforms (高台),\ndeep pools (深池),\ntolling bells (撞钟),\nand dancing women (舞女),\ntaking such displays as splendor (荣观),\nthen the people’s strength will be exhausted,\nand chaos and ruin will follow (乱亡斯作).\nThus the warning says:\nEven amid splendor (荣观),\nhe must rest content (燕尔安处),\ndetached (超然) and far removed from such distractions (远离而不顾).\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**\n*\"Hóngguān\"* (荣观) refers to the palaces (官阙) and resting halls (燕舍)\nwhere the queen and concubines reside (后妃所居).\n*\"Chāorán\"* (超然) means to stand far away and not dwell there.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nWhat the **sage** (圣人) values is the **Great Dao/Way** (大道),\nwhat he treasures is **heavy stillness** (重静).\nEven with the most splendid halls (瑶台琼室),\nhis dwelling is empty and tranquil (虚寂).\nEven with the most beautiful consorts (孋姬飞燕),\nhis heart remains in **non-action** (无为).\nPassions and desires cannot weigh down the true—\n*\"Hua wū\"* (华屋), though grand, cannot deceive him,\nand material things cannot burden him,\nhence it is said that he is detached (超然).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**\nFor those who uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),\neven amid the splendor of palaces (荣华之官观)\nand comfortable lodgings (燕寝之处所),\nthey keep their hearts in emptiness (虚澹),\ndetached from the world (超然物外),\nnot taking pleasure in such things,\nand though immersed, they are not stained (处染不染).\n\n**Third, it explains that those who indulge in lightness and agitation (轻躁) will lose their kingdom and their life (亡国丧身).**\nHow can a sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之主)\nlightly abandon his body (以身轻) for the sake of the world (天下)?\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\n*\"Nàihé\"* (奈何) is a word of lamentation (伤叹).\n*\"Tiānxià\"* (天下) refers to the supreme position (大宝之位).\nIt says: How can the sovereign abandon his body to desire (从欲),\nlightly use his life (轻用其身),\nand thus forfeit his position (令亡其位)?\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**\nThe Son of Heaven (天子) controls vast lands (封),\ntaxes from a million households (百万井),\nand levies tribute of sixty-four thousand (六十四万).\nHe commands a hundred thousand warhorses (戎马百万匹)\nand ten thousand chariots (万乘).\nHence it is called \"sovereign of ten thousand chariots\" (万乘之主).\n*\"Nàihé\"* (奈何) is a word of lamentation (伤叹).\n*\"Tiānxià\"* (天下) refers to the supreme position (大宝之位).\nThe sovereign of ten thousand chariots must unite the four seas (四海必同),\nand ensure his descendants number in the billions (子孙千亿),\nhis lineage endure for a hundred generations (本枝百代).\nIf he governs well, he will achieve **non-action** (无为) and universal transformation (偃化).\nIf he embraces virtue, he will cut off evil and return to **ren** (仁).\nHow can he, bearing this heavy responsibility (重器),\nindulge in pleasures and follow desires (耽乐是从),\nabandon his life to gratify his passions (以身充欲),\nand thus sink into ruin (沦胥以败)?\nHence, abandoning his body to desire (一身之欲)\nwhile lightly discarding his supreme position (轻大宝之位),\nis deeply lamentable—\nthus it is said: *\"Nàihé\"* (奈何).\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**\n*\"Nàihé\"* (奈何), the sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之主),\n*\"Nàihé\"* (奈何) is a reproach against the ruler (疾时王伤痛).\nThe sovereign of ten thousand chariots refers to the king (王者).\nAnd yet, he lightly indulges in licentiousness (轻淫)?\nIt reproaches the ruler’s extravagance (奢恣) and **lightness and agitation** (轻淫).\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nThe son of a thousand gold pieces (千金之子)\ndoes not sit idly in his hall (坐不垂堂),\nhow much more so the sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之君),\nwho must not lightly move without purpose (岂宜妄动).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**\n*\"Rúhé\"* (如何) is the same as *\"Nàihé\"* (奈何).\nThe king’s domain (王畿) is a thousand *lǐ* wide,\nand the sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之君)\nshould uphold **heavy stillness** (重静).\nYet he indulges in licentiousness (轻躁),\nimposes heavy taxes (厚赋),\nand multiplies labor services (繁徭).\nHe plunders the land for its beauty (禽荒),\nand indulges in excess (色荒).\nHe neglects the world (轻忽宇内),\nand his lamentation is great—\nhence it is said: *\"Nàihé\"* (奈何).\n**Lightness** (轻) causes him to lose his ministers (失臣),\n**agitation** (躁) causes him to lose his sovereignty (失君).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nIf the sovereign is **light and careless** (轻易),\npeople will scatter (离散),\nhence he loses his ministers (失臣).\nIf ministers are **agitated and greedy** (躁求),\nthe sovereign will be disgraced (不齿),\nhence it is said that he loses his sovereignty (失君).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**\nIf the sovereign is often **light and careless** (轻易),\nhe will surely bring trouble (烦扰),\nand trouble will cause people to scatter (人散).\nWho will remain to serve as his ministers?\nThus it is said: **Lightness** (轻) causes him to lose his ministers (失臣)—\nthis is a warning to the sovereign.\nAs a minister, one should measure his abilities before accepting office (量能受爵),\nand not hasten to seek promotion (速官).\nIf he falsifies his path to gain wealth (矫迹干禄),\nor deceives to secure honor (饰诈析荣),\nand is as **agitated and greedy** (躁求) as this,\ndisaster will follow (祸败寻至),\nand he will be banished (坐招窜拯).\nHow can he serve the sovereign?\nThus it is said: **Agitation** (躁) causes him to lose his sovereignty (失君)—\nthis extends the warning to ministers.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**\n**Lightness** (轻) causes him to lose his ministers (失臣),\nthe sovereign’s **lightness and licentiousness** (轻淫) cause him to lose his ministers,\nand **lightness** (轻) in self-cultivation causes him to lose his vitality (失其精).\n**Agitation** (躁) causes him to lose his sovereignty (失君),\nthe sovereign’s **agitation and haste** (躁疾) cause him to lose his position (失其君位),\nand **agitation** (躁) in self-cultivation causes him to lose his spirit (失其精神).\n\n**Master Yán (严) says:**\n*\"Shī chén zuò shī běn\"* (失臣作失本),\nspeaking of how the sovereign’s indulgence in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁)\nis like a tree’s roots being shaken (根本而摇动).\nIf the roots shake, the branches will wither (技木枯),\nand the trunk will dry up (桔而槁).\nIf the sovereign is not **still** (静),\nthe people will be unsettled (摇荡),\nthe ancestral temples will be endangered (倾危),\nand he will lose his position as king (失其国君之位).\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nEarlier, it was explained that **heavy stillness** (重静)\nleads to detachment (超然) and no burden (无累).\nNow, it is explained that **lightness and agitation** (轻躁)\nwill surely bring harm (致有损).\nNo burden means both sovereign and ministers are at ease (上下俱安),\nwhile harm means both sovereign and ministers are lost (君臣皆失).\n\n「○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏):\nTo indulge emotions and abandon **Daoist restraint** (恣情放欲),\nto grow ever **light and agitated** (轻躁日甚),\nexternally leads to the loss of the realm (亡国),\ninternally endangers one’s own body (危身).\nWhen loyal ministers are exiled and hidden (忠良窜匿),\nthis is the loss of **ministers** (失臣).\nWhen ancestral temples are toppled (宗庙倾覆),\nthis is the loss of **sovereignty** (失君).\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: *The Chapter of **Daoist Virtue** (善行)***\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor the earlier chapter expounds on the **sages** (圣人)\npracticing **heavy stillness** (重静),\nwhose actions do not stray from **Daoist quiescence** (寂).\nThus, this chapter elaborates on the **Daoist adept’s** (此人) **virtuous conduct** (行能功用).\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in **four layers** (文有四重):\n1. It first elucidates the **Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人),\n   whose **Three Businesses** (三业) are pure and **Daoist stillness** (清净).\n2. It then reveals the **Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人)\n   as **firm and unshakable** (结显坚固),\n   with the **Six Roots** (六根) **liberated** (解脱).\n3. It next demonstrates **transcending traces and urgent rescue** (降迹激救),\n   responding to all things without omission (应物无遗).\n4. Finally, it illustrates the **Dao of teacher and disciple** (师资之道),\n   the **marvels of cultivation** (修学之妙),\n   and its **eloquence** (而言之).\n\n1. **The Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人) **whose Three Businesses are pure** (三业清净).\nThe **sage** (圣) **responds to the vast Dao** (应圆界),\nhis **heart** (心) **settled in primordial stillness** (夏心湛寂),\nyet **does not act** (不行) while **transcending** (去).\nHe wanders through the **Midst of Kunlun** (远游昆阆之中),\nyet **does not depart** (不出) while **knowing** (知).\nHe treads upon **Jiaozhen** (瑕践瑶京之上),\nthe **Daode Palace** (瑶京).\n\nIn **stillness**, yet able to **move** (寂而能动),\ndwelling in darkness yet ever **illuminated** (处暗常明),\nhe **pities** (欲) the **myriad living beings** (我苍生),\nenduring their eternal suffering in the **Nine Abysses** (九幽).\nHe **lament**s (叹) those ensnared in **evil and filth** (彼邪秽),\nlost in the **Five Desires** (五欲) **for endless ages** (长昏).\n\nLike the **venomous serpent’s head** (嗔蛇头),\neven the **wise and virtuous** (贤圣) **dare not approach**.\nLike the **drunken elephant’s trunk** (醉象首),\nthe **enlightened** (达人) **abandon it**.\nThe **common and deluded** (凡迷) **how can awaken** (从何得悟)?\nThus, **Daoist virtue** (善行) **leaves no trace** (无迹)!\nWhen **rescue** (救) is sought,\nthe **Dao of teacher and disciple** (师资之道) **is unified** (一齐),\nand the **hearts of all beings** (凡圣之心) **are extinguished** (双泯).\n\n**Daoist virtue** (善行) **leaves no trace** (无辙述).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\nWithin all **dharma** (诸法),\nrealizing the **true nature** (体了真性),\nactions manifest **no action** (行无行相),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).\n\nSo, the **heart unites with the Dao** (心与道冥),\nand **no trace or path** (辙迹) **can be sought**.\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**\nThis reveals the **pure nature of dharma** (法性清净).\n**Actions** (行) refer to **cultivation** (修行).\nWhen the **nature of dharma** (法性) is pure,\nthis is called **Triple Primordial** (重玄).\nThough one relies on **diligent practice** (勤行),\none must **avoid attachment** (无着),\n**gradually extinguishing** (次来次灭)\nuntil **actions manifest no form** (行无行相).\nThe **heart unites with the Dao** (心与道合),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).\nTo achieve this is to **equalize emptiness and unity** (空有一齐),\nwhere **phenomena and mind are both pure** (境心俱净).\nIf one seeks **traces or paths** (辙进),\nis it not **difficult** (难)?\n\n**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**\nThe **Daoist adept of virtue** (善行道者)\nseeks it **within oneself** (於身),\nnever descending from the **hall** (不下堂),\nnor stepping outside the **door** (不出门),\nthus **leaving no trace** (故无辙述).\n\n**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**\nThe **Seven-Scented Fragrance Chariot** (七香流水之车),\nwhen **moved** (动), has **traces** (有辙).\nThe **Thousand-Li Cloud-Steed** (千里浮云之马),\nwhen **leaping** (跃), has **pathways** (有述).\nYet **not hasty yet swift** (不疾而速),\n**cloud-plowing** (云耕) **does not trample the earth** (不辗地).\n**Not acting yet arriving** (不行而至),\nthe **Phoenix Bird** (凤鸟) **has no trace** (本无迹).\nThis speaks of the **sage** (圣人) **resting in the hall** (垂拱庙堂),\nyet **not following the tracks of Zhou’s kings** (不偏周王之辙),\nand the **virtuous scholar** (贤士) **fading into seclusion** (销声丘壑),\n**not diminishing the footsteps of Confucius** (不削孔丘之迹).\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**\nTo **act without action** (以无行为行),\nactions manifest **no form** (行无行相),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).\nWhen **cultivation is profound** (妙契所修),\n**phenomena and wisdom merge** (境智冥会),\nno **traces or paths** (辙迹) **are visible** (之可见),\nthis reveals the **purity of bodily conduct** (身业净).\n\n**Daoist virtue in speech** (善言) **leaves no blemish or censure** (无瑕谪).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\nOne who **comprehends the teachings** (能了言教),\nyet **does not cling rigidly** (不为滞执),\n**discards the form to seek the meaning** (遗象求意),\n**realizes the truth beyond words** (理证言忘),\nthus **speech is free from flaw or blame** (於言教中无瑕疵谪过).\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**\nThis reveals the **learned not clinging to words** (学人不滞言教).\n**Blemish** (瑕) means **defect or illness** (病).\n**Censure** (谪) means **blame** (责).\n**Speech** (言) refers to **teachings** (言教).\nWhen **Daoist virtue leaves no trace** (善行无迹),\none **comprehends the teachings** (能了言教),\nyet **does not cling rigidly** (不为执滞),\n**forgetting speech while in speech** (於言忘言),\nthis is **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言).\nThus, **discarding forms to guide meaning** (遗象导意),\n**truth illuminates speech-forgetting** (理照言忘),\nin all **teachings** (言教),\n**there is no defect or blame** (一无病责),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言无瑕谪).\n\n**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**\n**Daoist virtue in speech** (善言) **is to choose words wisely** (择言而出之),\nthus **no flaw or blame exists in the world** (无瑕疵谪过於天下).\n\n**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**\nWhen **words strike the bell** (言铃有中),\n**a thousand li respond** (千里应之),\nyet **speak only of the Dao** (非法不言),\nwhat **blame** (过) **could there be**?\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**\n**Speech without speech** (不言之言),\n**speaking yet not speaking** (言而不言),\n**all day speaking yet never truly speaking** (终日言未尝言),\n**nor truly not speaking** (亦未尝不言),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言).\nAs the *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Words sufficient to convey the Dao\nare spoken all day yet exhaust the Dao.\"* (言而足则终日言而尽道也).\n**Blemish** (瑕) means **defect or illness** (疵病).\n**Censure** (谪) means **blame** (过责).\n**Silence and speech are alike** (默语不异),\nthus **no blame for words** (无口过之责).\nThe original text uses the character **de** (的),\nreferring to the **sage’s speech** (圣人之言),\nwhich **lacks any target** (既无的当),\nthus **no blame for any direction** (故无所之谓).\nThis reveals the **purity of verbal conduct** (口业净).\n\n**Daoist virtue in thought** (善计) **requires no scheming** (无筹算).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\nOne who **comprehends all dharma** (能了诸法),\n**has no dual paths** (本无二门),\n**unifies all with one principle** (一以贯之),\n**does not generate other views** (不生他见),\nthus **no need for scheming or calculation** (故无劳筹算),\n**naturally illuminated and comprehended** (自然照了).\nWhen **thoughts manifest no thought-form** (计无计相),\nwhat is more **virtuous** (善) than this?\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**\nThis reveals **teachings not clinging** (言教无滞),\nthus **no duality in thought** (则不计异门).\nWhen one **clings to words and stagnates in actions** (执言滞行),\n**distinguishing right from wrong** (辨是与非),\neven **clever strategists** (巧历) **cannot compute**.\nYet if one **comprehends all dharma as expedient means** (能了诸法皆方便门),\n**ultimately pure and unadulterated** (究竟清净),\n**not generating other views** (不生他见),\nthen **no need for scheming or calculation** (则无劳筹策算数),\n**one can naturally penetrate the One Vehicle** (自能深入一乘).\nWhen **thoughts are thus virtuous** (善计若斯),\nwhy **labor in scheming or calculation**?\nThus it is said: **Daoist virtue in thought requires no scheming** (善计不用筹算).\n\n**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**\nThe **virtuous in thought** (善以道计事者)\n**holds to one principle without deviation** (守一不移),\n**thoughts are few** (所计不多),\n**no scheming is needed yet all is known** (不用筹策而可知者).\n\n**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**\n**Scheming and calculation** (筹策) **are for counting things** (算物数),\nbut **the Dao observes all** (以道观之),\n**nothing is left unexamined** (物无不尽),\n**the Dao transcends numbers** (道非於数),\nso why use **scheming and calculation**?\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**\n**Mysterious comprehension** (妙悟) **of all dharma as one** (诸法同一虚假),\n**not setting up falsehoods** (不设虚假),\n**falsehoods reveal truth** (即假体真),\n**no need for calculation** (无劳算计),\n**suddenly illuminated and clear** (划然明了),\nthis reveals the **purity of mental conduct** (意业净).\n\n2. **Revealing the firm and unshakable vow** (结愿坚固), **and the liberation of the Six Roots** (六根解脱).\n**Daoist virtue in closing** (善闭) **has no bolts or bars** (无关梃) **yet cannot be opened** (而不可开).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\n**Both speech and action are forgotten** (兼忘言行),\n**not entering false paths** (不入异门),\n**the heart does not wander

the Heroic (知雄章)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the previous chapter **illuminated the virtuous** (善行之士) who **constantly rescue others**; yet their **method of saving all things** (救物之方) **remains yet to be revealed**, so this chapter **briefly outlines its essence** (故次此章略示其要).\n\nWithin this chapter, **four distinctions are expounded** (文开四别):\n1. **To discard rigidity and embrace softness** (去刚取柔) is the **essential path for the practitioner** (是修行人要径);\n2. **To urge the abandonment of clarity for the sake of hearing** (遣明归闻) is the **model for learning the Dao/Way** (为学道楷模);\n3. **To endure humiliation and forget glory** (守辱忘荣) is to **return to the root and reflect upon the origin** (归根反本);\n4. **To craft the skilled and embrace the common** (匠成庶品) is to **benefit others and forget one’s own merit** (利物忘功).\n\n**First: To discard rigidity and embrace softness, is the essential path for the practitioner.**\nThe **rigid and strong are perilous** (夫刚健者凶), **the Daoists warn**; the **heroic and mighty are humbled** (雄壮者屈), **the ancient sages’ adage holds**. Thus, **strong armies do not conquer in the forefront** (故兵强不胜於前), **weak waters break through what is firm in the rear** (水弱破坚於后). **Zhang Hua said:**\n*\"Do not boast of your glory,\nFor the Dao/Way abhors excess;\nDo not cling to your honor,\nFor the towering shall fall,\nAs the wise and noble observe.\"* (无矜尔荣，天道恶盈，无侍尔贵，隆隆者坠，贤达所作，诚不虚言).\n\n**Knowing the cycle of the four seasons** (是知四时去来), **the shift of cold and heat** (寒暑易准), **the interplay of yin and yang** (二仪回薄), **the waxing and waning of the sun and moon** (日月亏全), **how much more so for those who merge with the Dao/Way** (何况体道融明), **who know to embrace the white while abiding in the black** (知白守黑), **whose wondrous forms radiate in perfect harmony** (妙象圆照), **who discard the heroic and return to the receptive** (去雄归雌)! **To endure through countless kalpas** (历万劫而不为), **to observe the singular heart ever abiding** (观一心而常住), **is to be the valley to which all things flow** (为溪为谷，天下归焉).\n\n**To know the heroic while guarding the receptive, is to be the valley of the world.**\n**To be the valley of the world** (为天下溪), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **and returns once more to the state of the infant** (复归於婴儿).\n\n**The Imperial Commentary (御注) says:**\n**The heroic** (雄) **suffers from the flaw of overuse** (患於用壮), so **to know the heroic is to guard the receptive in stillness** (故知其雄，则当守其雌静), **embracing humility to draw all things** (谦德物归), **thus becoming the valley of the world** (是为天下溪谷). **Then the constant virtue/power never leaves** (则真常之德不离其身), **holding the Dao/Way and nurturing harmony** (抱道含和), **and returning once more to the conduct of the infant** (复归婴儿之行矣).\n\n**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**\n**Knowing** (知) **is to discern** (辨识也).\n**Heroic** (雄) **is rigid and impulsive** (刚躁也).\n**Receptive** (雌) **is soft and tranquil** (柔静也).\n\n**All things value completeness and harmony** (夫物贵全和), **the law seeks the middle path** (法求中道). The **heroic is excessive** (雄则过当), the **receptive is too weak** (雌则卑弱); **both fail to align with virtuous conduct** (俱未适中於善行). **One must take the green cord as the standard** (必当绿督以为经), so **to know the heroic’s rigidity and impulsiveness** (知其雄躁), **one must guard the receptive’s softness and tranquility** (则当守其雌静).\n\n**To guard the receptive’s softness and tranquility** (守其雌静), **one must also know the heroic’s rigidity and impulsiveness** (亦当知其雄躁).\n**To know the heroic and guard the receptive** (知雄守雌) **is proper**, **but to know the receptive and guard the heroic is ruinous** (知雌守雄则败). **Ruined, it obstructs practice** (败则妨行), hence the special warning to **guard the receptive alone** (故特戒守雌).\n\n**To guard the receptive’s softness is to embody humility** (能守雌柔，是为谦德), **to which all things are drawn** (物所归往), **as waters flow into valleys** (如水归溪矣).\n**The *Er Ya* (尔雅) says:**\n*\"Water flowing into a river is called a valley.\"* (水注川日溪).\n\n**To be the valley of the world** (经为天下溪), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **and returns once more to the infant** (复归於婴儿). **Knowing the heroic and guarding the receptive** (知雄守雌), **this is called virtuous conduct** (是名善行), **to which all things are drawn** (物所归往), **making one the valley of the world** (为天下溪). **To do so is to never scatter the constant virtue/power** (能如此则真常之德曾不离散).\n\n**The constant virtue/power never scatters** (常德不散), **for this is to embody completeness and harmony** (即是全和). **Those of full harmony** (全和之人) **think little and desire little** (少思寡欲), **serene and unassuming** (泊然未兆), **like the infant** (乃如婴儿), hence the saying: *\"Return once more to the infant.\"* (故云复归於婴儿也).\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\n*\"To know the heroic and guard the receptive is to be the valley of the world* (知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪). **The heroic is likened to exaltation** (雄以喻尊), **the receptive to humility** (雌以喻卑). **Though one knows their own exaltation and display** (人虽自知其尊显), **one must still guard it with humility** (当复守之以卑微). **To abandon the heroic’s strength and embrace the receptive’s softness** (去雄之强梁，就雌之柔和), **then all things shall return to it** (如是则天下归之), **as waters flow into deep valleys.\"* (如水之流入深溪也).\n\n**To be the valley of the world** (为天下溪), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **for those who humble themselves like deep valleys** (人能谦下如深溪), **their virtue/power is ever-present** (则德常在), **never leaving themselves** (不离己也).\n\n**Yan (严) says:**\n*\"To return to the infant is to return to one’s true intent* (於婴儿复归於志), **to the infant’s brother is to be foolishly unaware* (於婴兄蠢然而无所知也).\"\n\n**Rong (荣) says:**\n*\"To know the heroic and guard the receptive is to be the valley of the world* (知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪), **neither arrogant nor haughty** (不馅不骄), **for this is the middle path** (在於中平), **the conduct of the virtuous.* (君子之行也).\n**Neither stagnant nor restless** (不静不躁), **dwelling in the middle harmony** (处於中和), **is the foundation of entering the Dao/Way** (入道之基也).\n\nThus, **those who harbor the heroic’s fierce heart** (故知怀雄猛之心者), **cannot yet attain full truth** (未可全真).\n**Those who embrace the receptive’s soft nature** (抱雌柔之性者), **cannot forget the Dao/Way** (不能忘道).\n\n**To know the heroic nature while guarding the receptive** (令知性雄而守雌), **is to neither be restless nor hasty** (则不躁不速), **and to know the receptive nature while guarding the heroic** (亦知性雌而守雄), **is to neither be stagnant nor delayed** (则不静不迟). **To avoid entrapment in either extreme** (不滞两边), **is to naturally align with the middle path** (自合中道).\n\n**Yet many practice the heroic’s fierceness** (然行雄猛者众), **while few guard the receptive’s softness** (守雌柔者少), hence the analogy: **the enlightened are likened to deep valleys** (故喻明溪壑处下), **to which all currents flow** (众流归之), **and the humble are likened to the Dao/Way’s return** (人士谦退，道德归之).\n\n**The Imperial Commentary (成疏) says:**\n*\"To know the heroic and guard the receptive is to be the valley of the world* (知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪). **A valley is a path** (溪，径也), **the heroic is yang** (雄，阳也), **the name of rigidity and fierceness** (是刚躁之名), **the receptive is yin** (雌，阴也), **the essence of softness and tranquility** (是柔静之义).\n\n**To know the rigidity and fierceness of the heroic** (知雄躁刚猛), **is to return to death and annihilation** (适归死灭), **while to guard the softness and tranquility of the receptive** (雌柔静退), **is to attain longevity** (必致长生). Thus, **to abandon the heroic and guard the receptive** (故弃雄而守雌), **is to become the essential path for the world** (可为天下之要径).\n\n**The constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **and returns once more to the infant** (复归於婴儿). **To depart** (离) **is to scatter** (散也), **the infant is an analogy for undivided wisdom** (婴儿譬无分别智也). **It says that if one constantly guards tranquility** (言人常能守静), **their virtue/power will not scatter** (则其德不散), **thus returning to their original nature** (故能复於本性), **and embracing undivided wisdom** (归无分别智).\n\n**Second: To urge the abandonment of clarity for the sake of hearing, is the model for learning the Dao/Way.**\n**To know the white and guard the black, is to be the pattern of the world.**\n**To be the pattern of the world** (为天下式), **one’s constant virtue/power does not err** (常德不武), **and returns once more to the boundless** (复归於无极).\n\n**The Imperial Commentary (御注) says:**\n**To guard the receptive’s tranquility** (能守雌静), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离). **Though their virtue/power is clear and bright** (德虽明白), **they must be like darkness** (当如暗昧), **thus becoming the pattern of the world** (如此则为天下法式). **Their constant virtue/power applies without deviation** (常德应用), **never differing** (曾不差违), **and their virtue/power is inexhaustible** (德用不穷), hence it **returns once more to the boundless** (故复归於无极). **To err** (武) **is to deviate** (差也).\n\n**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**\n*\"To know the white and guard the black is to be the pattern of the world* (知其白，守其黑，为天下式). **White is illumination** (白，照明也), **black is darkness** (黑，暗昧也), **pattern is law** (式，法也).\n\n**Those who guard the receptive’s tranquility** (夫能守雌静), **their conduct becomes radiant and clear** (则德行昭明). **Though their conduct is clear** (德虽昭明), **they do not pursue worldly matters** (不以务物), **and remain like darkness** (当如暗昧), **selflessly preserving purity and harmony** (自守淳和). **To do so is to become the pattern of the world.* (能如此则可为天下之法矣).\"\n\n「To be the world’s **pattern** (式), **virtue/power** is always unerring (常德不忒), **returning once more to the boundless** (复归於无极).\n**To err** (忒) **is to deviate** (差, *also called* 武).\n**Boundless** (极) **is the utmost limit** (穷极也).\n\n**To know the white and guard the black is called complete virtue/power** (知白守黑，是谓德全).\n**Those with complete virtue/power** (德全之人) **can become the world’s pattern** (可为天下法式), **then the Dao of true constancy** (真常之道) **flows in response and is applied** (随应而用), **its application never differing** (应用无差忒), **its use inexhaustible** (用亦不穷), hence it **returns once more to the boundless limit** (故云复归於无穷极也).\n\n**Master He Shang Gong (河上公) said:**\n*\"To know the white and guard the black is to be the world’s pattern* (知其白，守其黑，为天下式). **White** (白) **illuminates** (喻昭昭), **black** (黑) **is silent** (喻默默).

Once engaged in form and vessel (形器), there must be both refined and coarse (精赢), hence the Sage employs them and they become **officials and leaders of the masses** (群村之官长).\n\n○ The Imperial Exegesis: **Vessels** (器) are **forms and vessels** (形器). From **knowing the masculine** (知雄) to **guarding shame** (守辱), through cultivation of nature and return to **virtue/power** (德), it again returns to the **Dao/Way** (道). Here, when it says **simplicity disperses to become vessels** (朴散则为器), it clarifies that when **virtue/power** (德) is fully unified with the **Dao/Way** (道), it can respond and apply itself. When application becomes coarse (迹粗), it involves **forms and vessels** (形器), hence it says **simplicity disperses to become vessels** (朴散则为器). Once engaged in form and vessel, the **masses’** (村) usage will have refined and coarse (精粗), thus ordinary people employing them can only preserve their own **purity and simplicity** (淳朴), while the Sage’s broad salvation becomes **officials and leaders of the masses** (群村之官长).\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong (河上公) said: When **simplicity** (朴) disperses, it becomes **vessels** (器). The **simplicity** (朴) of all things disperses to become **vessels and their uses** (器用). If the **Dao/Way** (道) disperses, it becomes **spiritual luminosity** (神明), flowing as the **sun and moon** (日月), dividing into the **Five Phases** (五行). The Sage employs them and they become **officials and leaders** (官长); when the Sage applies them externally, they become the **original leaders of all officials** (百官之元长).\n\n○ Rong (荣) said: When **the seed** (种) disperses, it becomes **vessels** (器). The Sage uses them as **officials and leaders** (官长), hence the great measure is without harm (割). Before **qi** (气) is divided, it is **the seed** (种). When the three **kinds of virtue/power** (三种) have positions, they are **vessels** (器). From the **formless** (无形) to opening **manifest forms** (有象), hence it speaks of **dispersing simplicity to become vessels** (散朴以为器). The **noble** (尊) and **humble** (卑) nature of Heaven and Earth being established, the **noble** (贵) and **humble** (贱) nature of ruler and subject is also clear. It is set as ruler, hence it says **officials and leaders** (官长). Governing all under Heaven, hence it speaks of **great measure** (大制). The **high** (上) can nurture and give life (字育), the **low** (下) can receive without harm (不伤), hence it says **without harm** (无割). This also clarifies the Sage’s opening of the **teachings of the unsaid** (不言之教), which is the same as **dispersing simplicity to become vessels** (散朴为器).\n\n□ The true **Immortal Adepts** (真仙) are the **officials and leaders** (官长). They employ the **Dao/Way** (道) to govern all things, and all things return to them—this is the **great measure** (大制). Their **compassion** (慈) can save all things, and all things are preserved whole—this is **without harm** (无割).\n\n○ The *Ceng* Exegesis: The **Sage’s** (至圣) divine **virtue/power** (神力) is beyond thought or speech. Within the **Three Realms** (三界) and beyond, there is nothing not subdued. They lead and encompass all broadly and universally, hence they are called **great measure** (大制). Yet they **nurture and refine all things** (亭毒群品), **molding and tempering living beings** (陶铸生灵), **attributing merit to all** (推功於物), not harming them as a **butcher** (宰主). **Harm** (割) means to **butcher or judge** (宰断).」\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Chapter on \"Those Who Would Take the Realm\"**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior expounds on **forgetting merit and utility for things**, becoming a **sovereign and artisan** for the realm. Thus, this chapter reveals the **arts of governing the realm and body while benefiting things**.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:\n1. It first clarifies that **desire and action** ruin the body and destroy the realm.\n2. It then presents the **manifestations of action**, demonstrating that all **phenomena are impermanent**.\n3. Finally, it contrasts the **Sage**, who **mysteriously transcends attachment**.\n\n**1. Clarifying that desire and action ruin the body and destroy the realm**\n\nA **Dao-governed ruler** is a **non-acting sovereign**. To **take the realm**, one must **align with the times and respond to the people**. Thus, **King Wu of Zhou** overthrew Shang, and the **white banner hung from King Zhou’s head**; **Xiang Yu** ruled Han, and the **Red Emperor perished at his hands**.\n\nYet those who **do not know the coming of Heaven’s Mandate** and **arrogantly stir up ambition** are warned in the *Treatise on Fate*: *\"Dragons, rhinos, and sun-horned beasts are signs of imperial rule; river-eyes and tortoise markings are signs of noble rank.\"* Is this not so?\n\nThe **High Ancestor** (Han Gaozu) **yielded and ascended** to power, while **Qin Shihuang** **brutally seized it** and saw his line **decline**. I see that those who **take the realm by force** cannot **sustain it**. Is this not the truth?\n\n*\"Those who would take the realm and do so—*\nI see that they **cannot achieve their ends**.\"*\n\n**Emperor’s Annotation:** *\"The realm\"* refers to the **precious position of sovereignty**. A ruler must **await the Mandate’s arrival**—if a **violent usurper** seeks to **seize it by force**, it will not endure.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:** *\"The realm\"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**. Heaven **commands emperors** and **governs all living beings**—this must await the **Mandate’s arrival** before one **rules over all**. Yet **wicked rebels** and **violent men**, who **seek to seize the realm by force**, will be **exterminated before they can even hope for Heaven’s blessings**. Thus, the **Daoist Master warns**: *\"I see that such men **cannot achieve their ends**.\"* *\"Already\"* is a **particle of emphasis**.\n\n**River Upper Master (河上公) says:** *\"Those who would take the realm\"*—meaning they **aspire to be sovereign**. *\"And do so\"*—meaning they **rule through action**. *\"I see that they **cannot achieve their ends**\"*—because **Heaven’s Way abhors turmoil and impurity**, and **human hearts abhor excessive desire**.\n\n**Yan (严) says:** *\"The realm\"* is what **spiritual essences** create and **Great Harmony** fulfills—**spiritual essences perceive it**, and even **sages cannot fully grasp it**; **force cannot control it**.\n\n**Li (李) says:** *\"Non-action and non-doing\"* can **govern the realm**. If one **acts and does**, I see that they **cannot achieve their ends**.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"Those who would seize the realm and its people as sovereigns\"* must **empty their hearts and abandon desire**. If they **seize it through action**, their **failure is already evident**.\n\n*\"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**.*\n*Those who force it—**ruin it**.\"*\n\n**Emperor’s Annotation:** *\"The realm\"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**, a **divine instrument of Heaven and Earth**—thus, it **cannot be seized by force**. Hence, *\"Those who force it—ruin it\"*—this warns **wicked and rebellious ministers**.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:** *\"The realm\"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**, which **cannot be seized by force**—for it is a **divine instrument** meant for **eternal sages** who **spread benevolent transformations**, ensuring that **violent men do not poison the realm with their schemes**. Thus, it is **known that it cannot be forced**, and if forced, it **will surely fail**. This warns **wicked and rebellious ministers**.\n\n**River Upper Master says:** *\"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**.\"* *\"Instrument\"* means **thing**—**humanity is the divine thing of the realm**. Divine things **love tranquility** and **cannot be governed by action**. *\"Those who force it—ruin it\"*—because **governing through action corrupts their innate purity**.\n\n**Li (李) says:** If one **promotes the realm’s goodness without claiming its rewards**, **removes the realm’s harms without taking credit**, and **allows all to drink the harmony of virtue**, then **all things follow transformation in joy**, and one **can securely hold the precious position and guard the divine instrument**. But if one **does not know the error of action** and **clings to it**, then **ruin and loss are certain**.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**.\"* All **sentient beings** possess **spiritual essences** and **can receive the Dao**—thus, it is called a **divine instrument**. The **divine instrument** is also the **imperial position**. If one **governs with non-action and tranquility**, all things **prosper in harmony**; but if one **disturbs with action**, all living beings **lose their nature**—thus, it **cannot be forced**. *\"Those who force it—ruin it\"*—**clinging to action leads to ruin and death**; **fixating on desires causes loss of realm and state*. *\"Those who cling—lose it.\"*\n\n**Emperor’s Annotation:** *\"The Mandate rests upon them\"*—they have already **obtained sovereignty**, yet they **cling to this position**, **oppressing the divine sovereign**. Heaven’s **retribution will cause them to lose it**—this warns **emperors**.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:** A **ruler** may either **restore order from chaos** or **preserve the ancestral path**. All must **display virtue and block transgressions**, **relieve the hidden and seek the crippled**. But if they **cling to this position**, **oppressing the divine sovereign**, they **bring disorder without form**, causing **Heaven’s retribution to punish the wicked and bless the virtuous**, **divine wrath and human anger to arise**, **disasters to multiply**, and **chaos to ensue**. Who would **obey such a ruler**? They will **surely lose their position**. This warns **emperors**.\n\n**River Master (He Shang Gong) says:**\nIf one **forcefully clings to teachings**, they lose their **true essence**, giving rise to **deception and falsehood**.\n\nThe second principle: **The Sage’s Minister** demonstrates that all **dharma/laws are impermanent**.\nThus, things **move or follow**, **warm or chill**, **strengthen or weaken**, **uphold or collapse**.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:**\nTo **act is to fail**; to **cling is to lose**. Hence, things may **move ahead**, **follow behind**, **warm by exhalation**, **chill by inhalation**, **strengthen when supported**, **weaken when suppressed**, **succeed when guided by Dao**, or **collapse from lack of virtue**.\n\n**Emperor’s Commentary:**\nThis illustrates that all things are **not constant**, and affairs **rise and fall in turn**.\n**Exhalation (mǘ)**—warm *qi*.\n**Inhalation (chuī)**—cold *qi*.\n**Weak (yíng)**—feeble.\n**Uphold (zài)**—to **manage affairs**.\n**Collapse (huī)**—to **ruin**.\n\nMoreover, **action leads to ruin**; **clinging leads to loss**. Just as all things **move ahead or follow behind**, **warm or chill**, **strengthen when supported or weaken when suppressed**, **uphold affairs or push toward ruin**—like **red and black threads**, they cannot be measured by a single standard. Only by **aligning with natural inclination** can one **endlessly promote without exhaustion**.\n\n**River Master says:**\nThus, things **move or follow**—what the **sovereign leads**, the **subjects must follow**.\n**Exhale or inhale**—**exhale** is **warmth**; **inhale** is **cold**.\nWhere there is **warmth**, there must be **cold**.\n**Strengthen or weaken**—where there is **strength**, there must be **weakness**.\n**Uphold or collapse**—**uphold** is **stability**; **collapse** is **peril**.\nWhere there is **stability**, there must be **peril**.\nThis teaches that **rulers must not act**; governing a **state and the body** alike requires **non-action**.\n\n**Honor (Rong) says:**\nThe **laws of action** have what may be **done ahead** or **followed behind**, **one warmth and one cold**, **one flourishing and one decline**.\n**Gathered, they cohere**; **scattered, they collapse**.\nIf one **acts**, though it **succeeds, it must fail**.\nIf one **acts without action**, it **can decay yet renew**.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThings **move or follow**—**things** refers to **all phenomena**; **or** means **indeterminate**.\n**Move**—**proceeds by itself**; **follow**—**conforms to others**.\nThis shows that **power and influence are unstable**.\n**Exhale or inhale**—**exhale** (*mǘ-xī*) symbolizes **warmth** (*riches and nobility*); **inhale** (*chuī-qì*) symbolizes **cold** (*poverty and lowliness*).\nThings may **first be noble then humble**, **first rich then poor**—\nlike **scarlet summer’s brilliance** or **dark winter’s chill**,\n**Heaven’s heat and cold are unstable**, so too are **human fortunes**.\n**Strengthen or collapse**—**what flourishes must decline**.\nThus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: **\"The flourishing must decay.\"**\nThis shows that **flourishing and decline are unstable**.\n**Uphold or collapse**—**uphold** is **continuity**; **collapse** is **ruin**.\n**Continuity is success**; **ruin is failure**.\nThis proves that **safety and peril are unstable**.\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says:\n**\"Its completion is its ruin.\"**\nThese **eight unstable laws** demonstrate that **all phenomena are impermanent**.\nTherefore, those who **govern states or cultivate the self** must **not cling to action or rigid control**.\n\n---\n**Third Principle: Responding to the Seated Sage**—**masterfully abandoning attachment**.\n\nThus, the **Sage eliminates excess**, **eliminates extravagance**, **eliminates excessiveness**.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage observes how things **move or follow**, knowing that **clinging leads to loss**, so they **avoid extremes**.\n\n**Emperor’s Commentary:**\nTherefore, the **Sage who governs the world**—\nseeing that **movement and following are impermanent**—\nknows that **arrogance and clinging must fail**.\nThus, they **restrain themselves**, **examine their conduct**, **cut greed**, and **control desires**.\nThey **reject excessive action**, **reject lavish adornment**, and **reject excessive indulgence**.\nExamining their **names and principles**, they are divided into **three categories**.\nYet their **practical effect** aligns with **one principle**.\n**Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness**—all are **transgressions**.\n\n**River Master says:**\n**Excess** refers to **lust for sounds and colors**,\n**Extravagance** refers to **garments, food, and drink**,\n**Excessiveness** refers to **palaces and pavilions**.\nAbandoning these three, one **dwells in moderation**, **acts without action**—\nthen the **world transforms itself**.\n\n**Yan (Yan) says:**\n**Excess** is **action**; **extravagance** is **not moderation**; **excessiveness** is **grandeur**.\nThus, they are abandoned.\n\n**Honor (Rong) says:**\n**Extravagant Qin**—this is the **action of the past**.\n**Pursuing desires is excess**; **a mind set on luxury is extravagance**; **unending indulgence is excessiveness**.\nThe Sage **empties the mind**, **knows contentment**—this is **abandoning excess**.\n**Embrace simplicity, preserve purity**—this is **abandoning extravagance**.\n**Forgot joy, then true happiness suffices**—this is **abandoning excessiveness**.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe **Dao-endowed Sage**, **profoundly embodying emptiness and falsity**,\ndoes not **cling to the eight unstable laws** above,\nbut **abandons the three temptations** below:\n**Excess** beautifies **sounds and colors**,\n**Extravagance** adorns **garments and playthings**,\n**Excessiveness** expands **palaces and halls**.\nAbandoning these **three delusions**, dwelling in **one moderation**—\ngoverning the state brings **long-lasting blessings**,\ncultivating the self brings **longevity and clear vision**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with Dao**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior **correctly illustrates** that **rulers must not cling to rigid action**.\nThus, this chapter **clarifies that ministers aiding the sovereign** must also **abandon force and employ Dao**.\n\nThis chapter unfolds in **three distinctions**:\n1. **Assisting the times with Dao**, **calming and settling the military**.\n2. **Those who use Dao** **lack arrogance or self-aggrandizement**.\n3. **Action contrary to Dao** **leads to peril and ruin**.\n\n---\n**First Distinction: Assisting the Times with Dao, Calming and Settling the Military**\n\nWhen the **Dragon of the Clouds** transforms, **Heaven and Earth grow dark**.\nWhen the **Phoenix soars aloft**, **the rivers rage in fury**.\nWhy?\nBecause **clouds amplify the Dragon’s power**, **water nourishes the Phoenix’s ambition**.\n\nLikewise, a **sovereign** must **await a worthy minister**.\n**King Wu** met **Ji Dan**—thus, the **Shang’s Dao flourished anew**.\n**King Xiang** lost **Le Yi**—thus, **Yan perished in decline**.\n\n「If a person can **expand the Dao**, how could it not be so?\n\nA wise sovereign who secures a **virtuous** minister is like a flying **Hun** (wild goose) with wings,\nA sage ruler who meets a **worthy** advisor is like a harmonious dish gaining its seasoning of salt and vinegar.\nThus, Jiang Chong met his end at **Fengchi** (凤池),\nAnd Ho Guang’s statue was enshrined in **Lingge** (麟阁).\nIs this not fitting?\n\n**Those who assist the sovereign with Dao** do not **employ arms to overawe the world**—their deeds **invite reciprocation**.\n\n**Commentary (御注)**:\nWhen ministers **employ Dao to aid the sovereign**, they must **yield in submission through virtue**,\nNot relying on the **threat of martial might** to **compel strength** from the world.\n\nFor **arms are instruments of calamity**, **war is perilous**.\nWhen **arms are applied to others**, others **must respond in kind**—\nTheir deeds **invite reciprocation**, thus the **fortunes of victory and defeat** are **not easily measured**.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (御疏)**:\n*以 (yǐ)* means **employ/use**.\n*佐 (zuǒ)* means **aid/support**.\n*还 (huán)* means **reciprocate/report**.\n\nIt states that as ministers, one should **employ Dao to transform without action**,\n**Aid the sovereign to attain the virtue of Yao and Shun**—\nThat is the **pillar and backbone** of the state.\n\n**Displaying martial prowess** on the **two stages** (of governance),\n**Cultivating cultural virtue** across the **four seas**,\n**Directing the grand symbol** (of Dao) so that all under Heaven **converge in order**—\nWhen the **great stage is level**, the **world is tranquil**.\nBut if one **brandishes the terror of weapons**,\n**Exhausts oneself in plundering conquests**,\n**Raises arms against others**—others **will inevitably respond**—\nTheir deeds **invite reciprocation**, thus who can **foresee the fortunes of victory and defeat**?\n\n**Master He Shang Gong (河上公) said**:\n**\"Those who assist the sovereign with Dao\"** means the sovereign **can employ Dao to aid himself**.\n**Not employing arms to overawe the world**—\n**Those who aid the sovereign with Dao** do not **use military force**,\nBut **follow the Dao and entrust in virtue**—enemies **will submit of their own accord**.\n\nTheir deeds **invite reciprocation**—\nTheir **undertakings invite reciprocation**—\n**Self-reproach does not blame others**.\n\n**Rong (荣) said**:\n**Loyal ministers aid the sovereign above**,\n**Worthy advisors regulate the **yin-yang** (cosmic balance)**,\n**Employing Dao to triumph within the seas**—\n**Not employing arms to overawe the world**—\nThe sovereign **also aids with Dao**,\nThe sovereign **already possesses Dao**—how could he **exclusively rely on arms**?\n\n**If Dao is employed**, then **both sides settle in peace**,\n**If arms are employed**, then **mutual aggression ensues**—\n**One act leads to another**—thus it is said **their deeds invite reciprocation**.\n\n**Master Cheng (成疏) said**:\n**\"Those who assist the sovereign with Dao\"** do not **employ arms to overawe the world**—\n*以 (yǐ)* means **employ/use**,\n*佐 (zuǒ)* means **aid and assist**.\n*Sovereign* here refers to **the ruler**.\n\nIt speaks of those who **employ the true Dao to aid the ruler**—\nThey must **lay down arms and cultivate culture**,\n**Guide the people with virtue**,\nNot **excessively using military force** to **oppress the world**.\n\nIf one takes it as a **metaphor for the mind and body**,\nThen it is the **three poisons and six senses**—arms are **the six senses**.\nTheir deeds **invite reciprocation**—\n*还 (huán)* means **to return/report**.\n\nIt states that **external reliance on arms** will **summon enemies’ grudges**,\n**Internal indulgence in the three poisons** will **bring the retribution of the three realms of suffering**—\nThis matter **reciprocates in kind**—thus it is said **their deeds invite reciprocation**.\n\nWhere the **teacher’s influence lingers**, **thorns and brambles arise**.\nAfter **great armies march**, **years of calamity follow**.\n\n「**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nWhere the military strategist stays, war disrupts agriculture—\nIf farming is neglected, thorns and brambles arise.\n\nWeapons inflict harm, and drought or flood follows—\nFarming is ruined before, and calamities ensue thereafter,\nThus there will surely be years of famine and disaster.\n\n**Commentary of the Imperial Scholar (御疏):**\n*Shī* (師), here means the ruler’s counselor,\nYet also the *Yì* (易, *I Ching*) says: *Shī* (師), means the multitude.\nWhen armies are raised and the people mobilized,\nMen are weary from service,\nAnd those who march and those who send them off hinder agricultural labor—\nThus thorns and brambles arise.\n\nAfter great armies return,\nAccumulated expenses are vast,\nAnd if the *héqì* (和氣, harmonious qi) brings blessings,\nWeapons still inflict harm, drought and flood follow in succession—\nHarvests fail, and so there will surely be years of famine and disaster,\nTo repay the grudges of relentless warfare.\n\n**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**\nWhere the military strategist stays, thorns and brambles arise—\nFarming is neglected, and fields are left uncultivated.\nAfter great armies return,\nThere will surely be years of famine,\nAs Heaven responds with malevolent *qì* (氣), harming the five grains—\nAnd when the five grains perish, people suffer.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nAfter great armies return,\nThere are surely years of famine,\nAnd fine crops cannot be planted—\nThus thorns and brambles arise,\nThis is also the fault of excessive warfare.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**\n*Shī* (師), here means the assembled forces.\nWhere soldiers and horses pass,\nThey harm both people and things—\nOnly thorns and brambles grow, no grain.\nIt is like the unrestrained *yùxīn* (欲心, craving mind) wandering where it will—\nOnly evil deeds multiply, no virtuous blessings arise.\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\nThey dare not rely on force to prevail.\nResolute yet not arrogant,\nResolute yet not boastful,\nResolute yet not proud,\nResolute only when unavoidable.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nThe virtuous counselor is resolute in halting the enemy—\nThis lies in calming the people and harmonizing the multitude,\nAnd they dare not seek victory or rely on force.\nThus, though resolute in stopping the enemy,\nThe enemy does not become a marauder.\nBe cautious not to boast of achievements or claim credit,\nLest you become filled with arrogance and pride,\nHence it is a profound warning.\n\n**Commentary of the Imperial Scholar (御疏):**\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\nThey dare not rely on force to prevail.\nThe *Chūnqiū* (春秋, *Spring and Autumn Annals*) states:\n*“Killing the enemy is resolute,”*\nYet now it is clear that the enemy-killer\nCommands them not to invade each other,\nBut to stop their violence.\nThus Laozi (老君) says:\n*“All actions should be unavoidable,\nAnd those who must use arms\nShould only seek to stop the enemy,\nPreventing them from becoming marauders,\nAnd should not use the many to oppress the few,\nNor invade others for the sake of force.”*\nTheir deeds invite withdrawal and retribution—\nHence the warning: *“They dare not rely on force to prevail.”*\nResolute yet not arrogant,\nResolute yet not boastful,\nResolute yet not proud—\nThe virtue of warfare lies in resolutely stopping the enemy.\nStopping the enemy out of arrogance is not true victory,\nHence, though able to stop the enemy,\nBe cautious not to boast.\nBoasting leads to reckless taking of credit,\nHence, though resolute in stopping the enemy,\nThe warning states: *“Do not claim credit for their deeds.”*\nIf one must claim credit for their deeds,\nThen they become arrogant and overconfident.\nArrogance leads to delight in killing,\nAnd defeat comes swiftly—\nThis is a clear warning, how could one not be cautious!\n\n**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\nThose who act virtuously should be resolute and daring.\nThey dare not rely on force to gain the name of strength.\nResolute yet not arrogant—\nThey should be resolute in humility, not boast of their own greatness.\nResolute yet not boastful—\nThey should be resolute in yielding, not claim credit for their achievements.\n*Páo* (骄), means to *overbear or deceive*—\nThey should be resolute in not overbearing or deceiving others.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\nThey do not rely on force, yet use it for virtue,\nAnd stopping the enemy is their resoluteness.\nWhen bandits invade us,\nWe remove them—\nThis is not an endorsement of exclusive military might.\nResolute yet not arrogant,\nResolute yet not boastful,\nResolute yet not proud,\nResolute only when unavoidable—\nArrogance is self-aggrandizement,\nClaiming credit is self-praise,\nUnending desire for victory is *fèn* (忿, resentment),\nAnd showing superiority to the enemy is *jiāo* (骄, pride).\nHence it is said:\n*“Righteous armies reign, responding armies triumph,\nResentful armies perish, proud armies are annihilated.”*\nThe virtuous wielder of arms,\nIs resolute and daring,\nNot arrogant nor resentful,\nNot greedy nor haughty—\nWhen forced to act, they respond from behind,\nTheir righteousness lies in removing the enemy and saving people,\nNot in relying on strength or delighting in war.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\n*Guǒ* (果), means *firmly determined*.\n*Yǐ* (已), means *to stop*.\nIt states that those who cultivate the Dao and are virtuous,\nFirmly determine to halt this violent mindset and not use arms.\n\nSecondly, it clarifies that those who use the Dao\nAre resolute yet do not boast or claim credit—\nThis is resolute yet not forceful.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nWhen the enemy invades and cannot be stopped,\nArms are used to halt them—\nThus their resoluteness lies in responding to the enemy,\nNot in using force to prevail.\n\n**Commentary of the Imperial Scholar (御疏):**\nThose who are resolute in stopping the enemy,\nAre not those who delight in victory and overbear others—\nBut when the enemy invades and there is no alternative,\nThus it is said: *“Resolute yet not by choice.”*\n*Yǐ* (已), means *to stop*.\nUsing arms to respond to the enemy,\nIs not to seek victory—\nIf one can do so, victory does not rely on force,\nHence it is said: *“Resolute yet not forceful.”*\n\n**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**\nResolute yet not by choice—\nThey should be resolute in sincerity, not in being forced.\nThis is resolute yet not forceful—\nThey should be resolute in not relying on strong armies or formidable armor to overbear others.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nIf one is firmly determined not to be haughty or arrogant,\nAnd acts only when unavoidable,\nThis is resolute yet not forceful.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**\nResolute yet not by choice—\nLike Yáo (尧) attacking the Mǐáo (有苗),\nAnd Yǔ (禹) attacking the Xù (有扈),\nThese were unavoidable actions, not a delight in arms.\nThis is resolute yet not forceful—\nThe first two lines establish that one must firmly decide not to use force.\nThirdly, it clarifies that deliberate actions contrary to the Dao\nWill surely lead to peril and destruction.\n\nWhen things reach their peak of vigor, they grow old—\nThis is called *bùdào* (不道, contrary to the Dao),\nAnd contrary to the Dao is early ruin.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nWhen things are overused in their vigor,\nIt is due to relying on force in arms.\nWhen things are overused, they decline—\nWhen armies are too strong, they meet defeat,\nThis is contrary to the Dao,\nAnd such actions must be stopped early.»\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**\nAll things at their peak of vigor grow old,\nAnd armies at their strongest meet defeat.\nThus, armies relying on strength\nAre like things in their vigor—\nTheir vigor only hastens decline,\nAnd strength in arms cannot fully ensure victory.\nThese two matters are called contrary to the Dao.\nWise ministers and enlightened rulers,\nKnowing them to be contrary to the Dao,\nMust cease such actions early—\nHence, *\"contrary to the Dao is early ruin.\"*\n*\"Ruined\"* is the same as *\"stopped.\"*\n\n**River Above Master (河上公) said:**\nThings grow old when vigorous—\nGrasses and trees, at their peak, wither and fall;\nHumans, at their peak, decline and age.\nThis shows that the strong cannot endure long.\nThis is called contrary to the Dao—\nWithering and aging come from not following the Dao.\n*\"Contrary to the Dao is early ruin\"*—\nThose who do not follow the Dao die early.\n\n**Honor (荣) said:**\nYoung yet already overgrown,\nFlourishing yet bound to decline—\nThis is *\"things grow old when vigorous.\"*\nIt clarifies that armies, when strong,\nWill meet defeat and grow weak—\nHence, it is not the Dao.\nThe Dao can be perpetually practiced,\nBut what is contrary to the Dao must be stopped early.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**\nThings grow old when vigorous—\nHeat at its extreme turns to cold—\nThis is the natural order.\nThings grow old when vigorous—\nThis meaning is inevitable.\nCalled contrary to the Dao,\nContrary to the Dao is early ruin—\nThings grow old when vigorous,\nArmies grow weak when strong,\nFor they lack humility and gentleness,\nThus not the true Dao—\nHence, they must be halted and not pursued.\n\n---\n**Chapter 31: The Chapter on Excellent Arms (佳兵章)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nFor though the prior chapter expounds on ceasing arms and practicing the Dao,\nIts meaning regarding the Dao’s application remains incomplete.\nThus, this chapter clarifies:\nWhen rectifying the times through the Dao,\nOne must rely on both *quan* (权, expedient means) and *shi* (实, true principle).\n\nThis chapter unfolds in four distinctions:\nFirst, it clarifies that though armies may seek strength,\nThe Dao forbids such actions.\nSecond, it reveals how things respond to the times,\nAnd the superiority or inferiority of the two intelligences (*quan* and *shi*).\nThird, it shows that *quan* does not abandon *shi*,\nAnd action does not depart from truth.\nFourth, it broadly outlines military laws,\nTo demonstrate the superiority of *shi*-intelligence.\n\n**First: Though armies may seek strength, the Dao forbids it.**\nHeaven’s Dao aids what is natural—\nTo oppose it brings misfortune.\nHuman affairs require tranquility—\nDisturbance brings calamity.\nIn the age of the Three Sovereigns,\nPure transformation abandoned arms.\nIn the age of the Five Emperors,\nCeremonial deference discarded warfare.\nFrom then onward, ruthless ambition arose—\nThus, Bai Qi led armies, deceitfully burying Zhao’s soldiers alive,\nAnd Tian Dan commanded troops, crushing Yan’s city.\nThey could not harmonize with humanity,\nNor adapt to the times—\nTheir evil spread through generations,\nYet they sought personal security.\nHow could they know the Old Master’s hatred of cruel weapons?\nStanding alone, self-guarded,\nSilent on the left, he issued clear warnings to all,\nCommanding them to avoid cruel weapons,\nAnd thus earned great virtue!\nWhy resort to killing?\n\nExcellent arms are instruments of ill omen.\nThings naturally abhor them—\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\n*\"Excellent\"* means *\"good.\"*\n*\"Arms\"* refers to *\"strategic schemes.\"*\nAll who cultivate speech and establish sincerity,\nUnable to conceal their virtue with morality,\nInstead take pride in military schemes and tactics—\nFor these schemes rely on conquest, slaughter, and destruction,\nMaking them instruments of evil.\nEven things naturally abhor them—\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not involve themselves in such matters.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**\nExcellent arms are instruments of ill omen—\n*\"Excellent\"* means *\"good,\"*\n*\"Arms\"* refers to *\"strategic schemes.\"*\n*\"Ill omen\"* means *\"not good.\"*\n*\"Instruments\"* are *\"evil tools.\"*\nThe virtuous cultivate virtue and refine their conduct,\nMust be cautious from the start,\nConcealing their abilities within,\nActing only when the time is right,\nTheir minds wandering through the realms of morality,\nTheir thoughts exploring the forests of ancient wisdom,\nSo their brilliance shines and their deeds prosper.\nYet some take pride in military schemes and tactics as excellence.\nFor strategic schemes rely on deception—\n*\"The Book of Changes\"* says, *\"Oddness is the basis of the extraordinary,\"*\nAnd military writings emphasize *\"striking first in sound, second in action,\"*\nAll centered on conquest, slaughter, and destruction—\nThus, they are evil tools.\nThings naturally abhor them—\nHence, those who follow the Dao do not involve themselves in such matters.\nTo cultivate virtue in oneself is the true endeavor.\nSince these are instruments of ill omen,\nEven things naturally abhor them—\nHow much more would the virtuous avoid them?\nThus, *\"those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\"*\n\n**River Above Master (河上公) said:**\nExcellent arms are instruments of ill omen—\n*\"Ill omen\"* means *\"not good.\"*\nArms disturb the spirit and muddy the harmonious *qi*—\nThey are not tools for the virtuous and should not be adorned.\nThings naturally abhor them—\nFor whenever arms are used, harm ensues,\nThus, all things abhor them.\nHence, those who follow the Dao do not wield them—\nThose who follow the Dao do not rule such lands.\n\n**Honor (荣) said:**\n*\"Excellent\"* means *\"ornamented,\"*\n*\"Ill omen\"* means *\"not good.\"*\nArms, when used, bring ruin to states and loss of lives—\nThus, they are called *\"not good.\"*\nLife is what people cherish,\nDeath is what things abhor—\nDeath is what things abhor,\nThus, enlightened rulers do not take pride in arms.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**\nExcellent arms are instruments of ill omen—\n*\"Excellent\"* means *\"ornate.\"*\n*\"Ill omen\"* means *\"not good.\"*\nThough frost-laden spears gleam in the sun,\nAnd jade-like blades shine in the sky—\nThese are tools of famine and disaster,\nNot instruments of peace.\nInternally, they dissolve the three poisons and six senses—\nIf one sharpens these senses yet clings to desires,\nSuch actions are evil.\nThings naturally abhor them—\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\nAll beings fear arms and abhor greed,\nThus, those who practice the Dao do not fix their minds on arms or desires.\n\n---\n**Second: Revealing how things respond to the times, and the superiority or inferiority of the two intelligences (*quan* and *shi*).**\n\nThe virtuous, at rest, value the left;\nIn war, they value the right.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\n*\"Left\"* is *\"yang.\"*\nYang harmonizes and brings forth life—\nThus, it is valued in peaceful times.\n*\"Right\"* is *\"yin.\"*\nYin congeals and brings severity—\nThus, it is valued in war.\n\n「Yang favors life, yin favors death.\nFavoring life, thus it is prized in times of peace.\nFavoring death, thus it is prized in war.\n○ Master of the Yellow River (河上公) says:\nIn peace, the virtuous prize the left—\nthe gentle and weak.\nIn war, they prize the right—\nthe strong and resolute.\nThis states that the Way of arms and the Way of the virtuous are opposed,\nyet their prized qualities differ.\n\n○ Yan (严) says:\nThe virtuous are rulers of the land,\nand prizing the left means valuing growth and nurturing.\n\n○ Rong (荣) says:\nThe *Classic of Heavenly Patterns* (经天) speaks of *wen* (文) as peace,\nand *wu* (武) as martial.\nThough their uses are equal in essence,\nrites and music must both be practiced,\nand water and fire must be managed with difficulty.\nWar must be waged with reason,\naction must follow the proper time—\nthus, in peace, favoring life takes precedence,\nand in war, the right is prized.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):\nThose who possess the virtue of a ruler are called *junzi* (君子).\nThe left field is auspicious, favoring life and prosperity.\nThe right field is ominous, favoring death and severity.\nIt says that in times of peace, the *junzi* prizes the left and uses *wen* (文),\nwhile in chaotic times, they prize the right and use *wu* (武).\nThis illustrates that true wisdom values longevity,\nwhile expedient wisdom acts at times with severity—\nthus the *Sutra on Guiding Sentient Beings* (度人经) says:\n\"Thousands upon thousands behead, tens of thousands dismember.\"\nArms are an ill-omened instrument,\n○ Master’s Annotation (御注): *Ill-omened* means *not virtuous* (不善).\nThose who favor arms uphold severity—\nthus they are not virtuous material.\n○ Master’s Exegesis (御疏):\nArms are ill-omened instruments,\nnot the tools of the *junzi*.\nThe earlier text states that fine arms are ill-omened instruments,\nfor when war is waged, one upholds the right and favors severity—\nthus those who follow the Dao do not employ them.\nThis text says that arms are ill-omened instruments,\ncorresponding with the earlier passage to clarify that they are not the *junzi*’s tools.\nThe *junzi* uses virtue and the Dao as their instruments—\nthus nothing can harm them.\n\n○ Master of the Yellow River says:\nArms are not virtuous instruments.\n○ Rong says:\nArms are ill-omened instruments,\nnot the tools of the *junzi*.\nThough arms may be used,\nthey often cause injury—\nthis is the domain of claws and teeth,\nnot the ruler’s proper function.\n○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:\nArms are ill-omened instruments,\nnot the tools of the *junzi*.\nWhen used unavoidably,\nthey serve as a last resort—\nthus the earlier text reiterates that arms are ill-omened,\nnot the tools of virtuous ones.\nThey must be employed only to subdue the wicked and aid the distressed,\nused unavoidably—\nexpedient wisdom is the same.\nTo make arms the primary instrument,\nis to wield a yin-strong axe that harms one’s own body—\nthus they are called ill-omened instruments.\nNot the tools of the *junzi*.\n○ Master’s Annotation:\nThe *junzi* uses virtue and the Dao as their instruments—\nthey do not prize the schemes of arms.\n\n○ Master of the Yellow River says:\nThey are not instruments the *junzi* should rely upon.\n\n**Third: Demonstrating that expedient wisdom does not abandon true wisdom, and responses do not stray from authenticity.**\nWhen unavoidable, use them—\nyet tranquility is supreme.\n\n○ Master’s Annotation:\nWhen the *Rongdi* (戎狄) invade internally,\none must act unavoidably.\nThe virtuous conquer without contention—\nthus tranquility is supreme.\n\n○ Master’s Exegesis:\nThe virtue of *wen* (文) is the instrument of governance.\nArms are its auxiliary.\nThus it is said that *wen* governs like the threads of heaven and earth,\nwhile *wu* (武) subdues calamities and chaos.\nThough heaven produces five materials,\ndiscarding one is impossible—\nyet martial prowess must be tempered with restraint,\nand moderation preserved.\nThus, the proper use of arms has its roots and branches,\nits order and disorder—\nall depend on circumstances.\nWhen unavoidable, one responds—\nmeaning when the four quarters invade,\nand the royal armies engage in battle,\none must still show them mercy,\nand temper actions with virtue and the Dao.\nThough one may repel like a mosquito stinging,\none should not lean on wrathful intent.\nFrom this perspective,\ntranquility is supreme.\n\n○ Master of the Yellow River says:\nTranquility is supreme—\nnot greedily coveting land or wealth for others.\n\n○ Rong says:\nTranquility is stillness—\nthe king deploys troops,\nbut only when called to defend,\nnever for reckless warfare.\nAction does not lose stillness—\nthus it is called tranquility.\nThey do not take pleasure in using arms.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:\nTranquility is non-action—\nthe *junzi*’s heart is also non-action,\nso though arms are used,\nthey are not deemed beautiful.\nThis illustrates that practitioners, though employing expedient wisdom,\nstill hold true wisdom supreme—\nresponses do not stray from authenticity.\nVictory is not beautiful.\nThose who find beauty in victory,\nare those who delight in killing.\nBut those who delight in killing,\ncannot achieve their ambitions in the world.\n\n○ Master’s Annotation:\nTo conquer an enemy,\none must pity them—\nthus victory is not deemed beautiful.\nThough victory brings many deaths,\nif one takes victory as beautiful,\nthen one delights in killing many.\nDelighting in killing many,\npeople will not follow.\nTo seek worldly ambition,\nis it not difficult?\n○ Master’s Exegesis:\nVictory is not beautiful,\nyet those who find beauty in it\nare those who delight in killing.\nUnable to embrace others with virtue,\nthey rely on arms to seek victory—\nthough they may triumph,\nthey still feel shame at their lack of virtue.\nVictory must bring many deaths,\nso those who take victory as beautiful\nare those who enjoy killing.\nThose who delight in killing,\ncannot achieve their ambitions in the world.\nThe ruler is the parent of the people—\nto find beauty in arms and killing\nis not to nurture them.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:\nVictory is not beautiful,\nyet those who find beauty in it\nare those who delight in killing.\nThe ruler, who delights in killing,\ncannot achieve their ambitions in the world.\nA ruler must not arbitrarily take lives—\nthey must not impose punishments recklessly.\n\n○ Rong says:\nThe ruler is the parent of the people—\nfinding beauty in arms and killing\nis not to nurture them.\n\n「○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:\nIf one finds beauty in victory,\nthey will delight in killing.\nIf one finds beauty in fine arms,\nthen they love to wield the sword and spear.\n\nTo delight in killing—\nthis is what all under heaven detest.\nWith many slain in battle,\nthey cannot achieve their true ambitions.\n\nThe fourth passage broadly cites military laws\nto illustrate the Daoist principle of **real wisdom’s victory**—\nauspicious matters are placed on the left,\ninauspicious matters on the right.\nThe **Viceroy-General** stands on the left,\nthe **Supreme-General** on the right.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nThe Viceroy-General is of lower rank,\nplaced on the left because they do not hold sole authority over killing.\nThe Supreme-General’s exalted status\nplaces them on the right, as they command military strategy.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nAuspicious matters are placed on the left,\ninaspicious matters on the right—\nthe left embodies the **Yang Principle**, the source of life, hence auspicious.\nThe right embodies the **Yin Principle**, the path of killing, hence inauspicious.\n*The Record of Rites (Liji) – Tan Gong* states:\nWhen the Master stood with his disciples,\nhe bowed and took the rightmost position.\nThe disciples also took the rightmost position.\nThe Master said:\n“My disciples’ zeal for learning\nis but as my sorrow for my sister’s death.”\nThe disciples then took the leftmost position.\n\nThe Viceroy-General stands on the left,\nthe Supreme-General on the right—\nthis is to liken military command to funeral rites.\nThe Supreme-General, placed on the right,\nholds sole authority over killing,\nwhile the Viceroy-General, as deputy,\ndoes not command life and death,\nthus standing on the left.\n\nNow, the left is exalted,\nthe right is lowly—\nthe Supreme-General, though now placed on the right,\nis likened to the funeral rites’ position,\nfor though they command killing,\nthey are treated with the solemnity of death.\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe left is the auspicious position,\nthe right is the funeral position.\nNow, the Viceroy-General, of lesser rank,\nstands on the left,\nwhile the Supreme-General,\nof greater rank, stands on the right—\nthis is to clarify that even if they command killing,\nthey are placed with the rites of death and mourning.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe funeral rites place the position on the right,\nand now the Supreme-General stands on the right—\nthis is to liken them to the rites of death.\nThe departed are honored with **Yin**,\nand killing many in battle\nis met with tears of sorrow and lamentation.\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nBecause life is precious yet must be sacrificed in war,\nthere is a compassionate and benevolent heart\nthat mourns the loss,\nand this is fitting.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nTo wage war and seek victory\nmust inevitably bring many deaths.\nVictory is not beautiful,\nso the Supreme-General mourns in sorrow and lamentation.\nThe people are the foundation of the state—\nif they are secure, the state is at peace.\nNow, in battle, many are slain,\nso the benevolent heart feels sorrow and pity,\nand this is indeed appropriate.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThis reflects the fear that one’s own **virtue/power** is thin,\nunable to transform the people through the Dao,\nand thus harming the innocent.\n\n○ **Master Rong’s Commentary:**\nThe purpose of arms is to uphold justice\nand rescue the people.\nTo mourn is to lament their straying from the Dao,\nto sorrow is to regret the harm done.\nIn ancient times, the use of arms was guided by **compassion (慈)**,\nand military affairs were valued by **virtue/power (德)**,\nnot by weapons alone.\nAfter defeating the enemy,\nthe Supreme-General wore plain attire\nand took charge of the funeral rites,\naccepting condolences as part of the ceremony.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nWherever arms are used,\nslaughter and harm abound.\nThus the Supreme-General mourns,\npitying the loss of life,\nfearing that the Dao was not followed\nand that the innocent may be harmed.\n\nVictory in battle is treated with funeral rites—\nthe Supreme-General, though placed on the right,\nis likened to the rites of death.\nThe right is exalted for the living,\nyet now the Supreme-General stands on the right—\nthis is because war is an **unauspicious instrument**,\nso they are honored with mourning attire,\nthough it is not truly a funeral rite.\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nWhen a warrior gains victory in battle,\nthey receive their title and stand on the right—\na position not auspicious,\nhence it is likened to funeral rites.\nBut war is merely an **unauspicious instrument**,\nso why must they don mourning robes\nand use a staff of office\nbefore it can be called funeral rites?\nAll commentaries on this meaning\nclaim that such a custom existed in antiquity,\nbut upon examining the ancient texts,\nthere is no evidence to support it.\nThe present interpretation is unsettling,\nso it is omitted.\n\nAgain, citing the case of Qin Bo weeping before his defeated teacher—\nthis was lamentation for defeat,\nnot for victory in battle.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nIn ancient times,\nwhen victory was achieved,\nthe Supreme-General would take the funeral master’s position,\nwearing plain attire and mourning,\nto show that the **gentleman values virtue/power (德) over arms (兵)**,\nand killing is only done when unavoidable.\nTheir reluctance toward killing\nis likened to the sorrow of mourning.\n\nKnowing that later ages would not cease from using arms,\nthey mourned in sorrow and grief.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe **gentleman** and the **good person** value the use of the Dao.\nWhen forced to resort to arms,\nthey do so only out of necessity.\nThough they may defeat the enemy,\nthey do not take it as a good thing,\nso they wear plain attire and mourn,\nand still observe funeral rites in burial.\n\nThough their martial prowess surpasses their literary skill,\nthis shows that **strategic expedience (权)** is inferior to **true wisdom (实)**.\nIn governing the state,\none must resort to arms when necessary,\nand to **strategic expedience** when unavoidable.\nBy this measure,\nit is clear that **strategic expedience is weaker than true wisdom**,\nand that **martial force is lesser than virtue/power**.\n\n**End of the *Zhuangzi* – *Xuan De* (玄德) Commentary, Volume Eight.**\n**Begin of the *Zhuangzi* – *Xuan De* (玄德) Commentary, Volume Nine.**»\n\n「Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary and Exegesis\n*Commentaries by Master He Shang, Lord Yan Junping, and Li Rong*\n*Exegesis by Master Xihua, Fa Xuan Ying, and Master Qiang Si of Mengyang*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Dao Constantly Without Name**\n\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous is that the prior chapter illustrates that \"good arms are not auspicious,\" hence one with the Dao does not dwell in them. This chapter demonstrates that if a sovereign and king upholds the Dao, then all things will naturally submit to them.\n\nThis chapter is divided into four parts within itself:\nThe first marks the \"Nameless One\" to elucidate the Dao,\nthe second cites the sovereign who upholds the Dao and thereby attracts blessings,\nthe third introduces the creation of named things and expands their applications,\nand the fourth concludes with the Dao descending to the \"Nameless One.\"\n\n**First: Marking the \"Nameless One\" to Elucidate the Dao.**\n\nThe most profound Dao, the true essence of the Way,\nis the precious *Zhenjing* of the Supreme Official.\nIts source is unfathomable, its nature serene and undisturbed—\nlength and brevity are equalized,\nso that the morning mushroom and the ancient tree share the same lifespan;\nfoolishness and wisdom are unified,\nso that the mythical *Tao* and *Liang* creatures merge into the dual *Zhuang* and *Yuan*.\n\nFrom the root to the branches, all distinctions dissolve,\nunified in speech yet divided in form,\nencompassing all phenomena yet returning to the True.\nAcross the three lives, purity is complete—\nnames vanish, dust and hues dissolve,\nand the transformation manifests:\nthe white deer appears at *Ren’an*,\nthe purple cakes descend to *Yinzǔ*.\nIts application is present,\nyet its name remains ever without—\nwhen sovereigns and kings uphold it,\nthe *Xianzhang* trees flourish like sweet dew,\nand the *Lieshi* naturally incline toward it,\ntheir ears cooled by the breeze of *Chengfeng*,\nthe Great Harmony without name—\ntruly, there is good reason for this.\n\n**Dao Constantly Without Name,**\nthough *Pu* is small,\nthe world dares not treat it as a subject.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*: The Dao is constant in its application;\nthis constancy can respond to all things,\nand its responses are not singular,\nhence \"constant without name.\"\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: Its application is inexhaustible,\nadapting only to what is sensed—\nthis is the Dao’s constancy.\nThe constancy lies in its application,\nyet its responses are not singular,\nhence \"constant without name,\"\nand thus it is said: *Dao Constantly Without Name*.\n\n*Master He Shang* says: The Great Dao can be both yin and yang,\ncan contract and expand,\ncan be vast or minute,\ncan preserve or vanish—\nhence it has no constant name.\n\n*Pu* is the wondrous origin.\n\nWhen speaking of its universal generation, it is called *Dao Yi* (One Dao);\nwhen discussing its refined unity, it is called *Pu*.\nThe wondrous origin, refined and singular,\nthus remains tranquil yet responsive in application.\n\nThe craftsman completes all universal generation—\nthis is the utmost greatness.\nHence, none dare treat the Dao as a subject.\n\n*Lord Rong* says: All named things are universally without constancy;\nyet now it is said to return to the constant Dao.\n*Pu* is the origin; *chén* (subject) is the lowly.\nThe constant Dao is the wondrous origin—\nneither great nor small,\nthough great, it cannot be prized,\nthough small, it cannot be belittled.\nIf sovereigns and kings uphold it,\nall things will naturally submit.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*: If sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,\nrefined and singular,\nacting without action,\nthen all things will naturally submit and serve them.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: It speaks that if sovereigns and kings embrace and uphold\nthe wondrous origin, refined and singular,\nacting without action or affairs,\nthen the eight extremes will look upward in transformation,\nthe four seas will return to virtue,\nand all will bathe in virtue and drink in harmony,\nnaturally submitting and serving.\n\n**Second: Citing the Upholding of the Dao and the Attraction of Auspicious Blessings.**\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite,\nthey descend sweet dew—\nnone commands it, yet it naturally equalizes.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: When sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,\nbringing about harmony,\nthere will be no calamities of drought or sandstorms,\nthe earth will be level and Heaven complete,\nthe two *qi* blending in equilibrium,\nuniting to descend sweet dew—\nauspicious blessings will naturally manifest for the sovereigns and kings.\n\n*Master He Shang* says: *Fa Tong* also says:\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite,\nit refers to the ruler upholding *Dao De*,\nuniting with Heaven and Earth,\nharmonizing *qi* so that it flows smoothly,\nauspicious blessings naturally descending—\nnone commands, yet transformation naturally equalizes.\n\nSweet dew is the fluid of harmonized *qi*.\n\n**Third: The Beginning of Creation and the Expansion of Its Applications.**\n\nThe creation of named things begins—\nonce names have been established,...\n\n「**御注**: The ruler, through *Dao De* governance and equilibrium,\nbegins to regulate and govern named things—\nthus, all named things are entirely under the sway of sovereigns and kings.\n*既 (jì)*, here means *exhaustive/all*.\n\n**御疏**: *制 (zhì)*, meaning *to govern/regulate*.\nThe *有名 (yǒumíng)* are the named things of the world.\n*既 (jì)*, here also means *exhaustive/all*.\nWhen sovereigns and kings embrace and uphold the *精一 (jīngyī)* of the Dao,\nHeaven descends auspicious blessings,\nand benevolent transformations occur without intent—\nuniform and balanced as one.\n\nThus, they begin to govern all named things,\nand things return to those who uphold the Dao—\nso all named things are entirely under the sway of sovereigns and kings.\n\n**河上公曰**: *始 (shǐ)*, the Dao.\n*有名 (yǒumíng)*, all things.\nThe Dao, though nameless, can regulate the named;\nthe formless can regulate the formed.\nHe who knows *止 (zhǐ)* knows cessation.\nKnowing cessation brings no peril.\n\n**御注**: If sovereigns and kings can govern named things,\nthen all named things will also know to depend upon the sovereigns and kings—\nto depend upon the ruler who upholds the Dao,\nand thus avoid perilous affairs.\n\n**御疏**: *殆 (dài)*, meaning *danger/peril*.\nIf sovereigns and kings transform through the Dao,\nall things naturally submit and serve—\nthus, all named things will know to depend upon the sovereigns and kings.\nTo depend upon the ruler who upholds the Dao,\nis to avoid affairs that bring ruin and peril.\nHence, it is said: *Knowing cessation brings no peril*.\n\n**河上公曰**: The laws of the named are all bound by desires,\nrebelling against the Dao and departing from *德 (virtue/power)*—\nthus, the body incurs destruction and dishonor.\nThe *经 (sutra/classic)* says: *Knowing cessation brings no peril*.\n\n**成疏**: When the *筌蹄 (quán tí)*—the snares and traps—are forgotten,\nthe wondrous logic is attained.\n*止 (zhǐ)* unites name with reality—\nthus, there is no peril.\n\n**荣曰**: The child depends upon the mother’s bell without harm,\njust as people depend upon the Dao—\nthus, there is no peril.\n\n**Fourth: The Dao/Way in the World, Illustrated by Its Completion.**\n\nThe Dao/Way in the world\nis like streams and valleys to rivers and seas.\n\n**御注**: Heaven descends sweet dew as an auspicious blessing,\nand the ruler who upholds the Dao nurtures the world—\nHeaven responds accordingly,\njust as streams and valleys flow into rivers and seas.\n\n**御疏**: Here, it illustrates that when sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,\nHeaven must respond to it—\nhence, it is said: *The ruler who upholds the Dao governs the world with benevolent virtue*,\nand thus brings about universal peace.\nHarmonized *qi* moves Heaven,\nand Heaven’s auspicious blessings must respond—\nlike the waters of streams and valleys\nflowing into the rivers and seas.\n\n**王弼曰**: This passage clarifies that the Dao does not dwell within the world,\nyet today we speak of its laws in the world.\nIt is likened to streams and valleys flowing into rivers and seas—\nstreams and valleys are the lesser,\nused to illustrate the *有名 (yǒumíng)*—the named;\nrivers and seas are the origin,\nused to illustrate the *无名 (wúmíng)*—the nameless.\n\nFrom whence do streams and valleys come?\nFrom rivers and seas.\nWhere do they return today?\nBack to rivers and seas.\nFrom whence do named things come?\nFrom the nameless.\nToday, governing all beings,\nwhere do they return?\nBack to the nameless.\n\nIf rivers and seas lacked streams and valleys,\nthey would not be full.\nIf streams and valleys lacked rivers and seas,\nthey would not flow.\nIf the nameless lacked the named,\nit would not be manifest.\nIf the named lacked the nameless,\nit would not arise.\nRivers and seas are like streams and valleys,\nhence they are full.\nThe named arises from the nameless,\nhence it is manifest.\n\n**知人者智 (Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing People)**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous,\nfor the previous clarifies that when the ruler upholds the Dao,\nall things naturally submit and serve—\nthis chapter elucidates the nature of those who submit and serve the ruler who upholds the Dao.\n\nWithin this chapter,\nthree statements about things convey one meaning,\nsequentially linked,\ntherefore divided into four sections.\n\n**First: Knowing Oneself**\nKnowing oneself brings clarity.\nThe bright mirror reflects shapes with purity,\nthe deep valley receives things with emptiness,\nthe great artisan molds and refines—\nfirst, he must be cautious of his *镇邹 (zhèn zōu)*—the balance and measure.\nCreation differentiates forms,\nyet never speaks to mortals.\n\nThus, knowing that *智 (zhi)* used in confusion with the Dao\nleads to loss,\nthe seven sages drove their chariots in haste,\nquestioned Shàngchéng but found no answer—\none child sat in contemplation,\ngazing at Héyáng while lost in thought.\nYáo and Shùn achieved greatness through *禅让 (chán ràng)*—the Dao’s transmission.\nYān and Qín lost their kingdoms through *争权 (zhēng quán)*—the struggle for power.\n\nThus, knowing to still *智 (zhi)* and conquer oneself—\nwho would not find the Dao harmonized?\n\nKnowing others is *智 (zhi)*,\nknowing oneself is *明 (míng)*.\n\n**御注**: *智 (zhi)* discerns through effort to comprehend things,\n*明 (míng)* illuminates through unity to perceive subtleties—\n*智 (zhi)* knows nothing unknown,\n*明 (míng)* reveals nothing unseen.\n\n**御疏**: *知 (zhi)*, to recognize and perceive.\nWhen the heart unites with its object,\nit is called *生知 (shēng zhī)*—innate knowledge.\nThe heart of innate knowledge recognizes and perceives past events—\nthis is called *知法 (zhī fǎ)*—knowing the law.\n\n**成曰**: To perceive past events clearly,\nto discern the nature of others—\ngreat or small, profound or shallow—\nnothing remains unknown.\nTo know one’s own past karma and present virtues and vices,\nthe retributions of the *三代 (sāndài)*—the Three Dynasties—\nnothing remains unclear.\n\n**河上公曰**: To know people’s likes and dislikes—\nthis is *智 (zhi)*.\nPeople can know their own worth and unworthiness—\nthis is *反听无声 (fǎn tīng wú shēng)*—listening inwardly without sound,\n*内视无形 (nèi shì wú xíng)*—gazing inwardly without form—\nthus, it is *明 (míng)*.\n\n**荣曰**: To hear and know is called *圣 (shèng)*—sagehood,\nto see and know is called *智 (zhi)*—wisdom.\nThen, it is difficult to know others externally,\nand difficult to know oneself internally.\n\nTo discern others and know their virtues and vices—\nthis is *智 (zhi)*.\nTo perceive oneself and know one’s gains and losses—\nthis is *明 (míng)*.\n\nTo know virtue is to associate with the virtuous,\nlike dyeing in fragrant orchids—\nto know vice is to distance oneself from the petty,\nlike avoiding the fishmonger’s stall.\n*智 (zhi)* exhaustively obtains loyalty and integrity,\nknowing loss removes it through repentance—\nthis is the true *明智 (míng zhì)*—wisdom and clarity.\n\nIf one follows the path of *清重玄 (qīng zhòng xuán)*—pure, weighty, and profound,\nand enters the gate of *虚寂 (xū jì)*—emptiness and tranquility—\nthose who know others recognize that all phenomena are empty,\nthose who know themselves understand that the self is not permanent—\nthe self is not permanent,\nhow then could one internally feed upon name and gain?\n»\n\nThe myriad phenomena are empty—\nwhat external defilement could cling to sounds and colors?\nInner and outer purity and stillness—\nthus it is called *明 (míng)*.\n\nAll things and self are unified—\nthus it is called *智 (zhi)*.\n\nAccording to the *Nanhua Jing* [Southern Flower Scripture]:\nThe Yellow Emperor wandered in the north of the Red River,\nascended Kunlun’s heights,\nand gazing southward, returned—\nhe lost his *玄珠 (xuán zhū)* [Mysterious Pearl].\nHe sent *智 (Zhì)* to seek it, but he could not find it;\nhe sent *离朱 (Lí Zhū)* to seek it, but he could not find it;\nhe sent *契诟 (Qì Gòu)* to seek it, but he could not find it—\nthen he sent *象罔 (Xiàng Wǎng)*.\n\n*象罔 (Xiàng Wǎng)* obtained it,\nand the Yellow Emperor said:\n“Strange! *象罔* alone could retrieve it.”\nIf one employs worldly cleverness and discrimination,\nseeking to distinguish right from wrong,\nand desires to trace the origin of the Dao—\nthis has never been heard of.\nOnly by extinguishing *智 (zhi)* can one grasp the true meaning.\n\nThus the Scripture says:\n*“Not to enlighten the people,\nbut to let them remain in their simplicity*—\nthis is its intent.”\n\n---\n\n**Second: Clarity in Self-Mastery**\nSelf-mastery preserves one’s strength.\nHe who overcomes others has force,\nhe who overcomes himself is strong.\n\n**御注 (Yù Zhù):**\nOne who can subdue others may be called strong in force.\nBut one who subdues his own heart, rendering it gentle and weak,\ncan alone preserve his true strength.\n\n**御疏 (Yù Shū):**\nHe who overcomes others relies on cunning and intelligence to prevail—\nsuch a man may be called strong in force.\nHe who overcomes himself masters his own heart,\nmaking it gentle and weak—\nnothing external can overcome him,\nthus he preserves his strength.\n\nHence the Scripture below says:\n*“Guard the gentle, and strength will endure.”*\nAnd again:\n*“The gentle overcomes the rigid,\nthe weak overcomes the strong.”*\nThus, self-mastery is true strength.\n\n**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**\nOne who excels in talent and skill may merely be strong in force.\nBut a strong man has his rival.\nIf he has a rival, his strength and weakness remain undetermined.\nNow, to govern emotions with innate nature—\nthis is self-mastery.\nThe self-mastered have no external rival.\nWithout external rivals, they are truly strong.\n\n**荣 (Róng) says:**\nHe who exerts force—\nthe greater his strength, the more he overcomes others.\nHe who cultivates *德 (virtue/power)*—\nthe higher his virtue, the more he subdues all things.\nAdvancing the Dao and refining one’s practice,\nstrengthening oneself without ceasing,\nnot sinking into error—\nthis is self-mastery.\nThe Daoist, forgetting all concerns,\nis unharmed by external things—\nthus he overcomes others.\nWith a vacant heart and weak bones, strength endures—\nhence the saying: *self-mastery is strength.*\n\n---\n\n**Third: Clarity in Contentment and Resolute Action**\nKnow contentment to be rich,\nstrengthen resolve to have purpose.\nHe who knows sufficiency is wealthy,\nhe who perseveres has resolve.\n\n**御注 (Yù Zhù):**\nHe who knows to be content lacks greed—\nthis is true wealth.\nHe who strives with unflagging effort is resolute—\nthis is true purpose.\n\n**御疏 (Yù Shū):**\nContentment lies in the heart.\nIf the heart knows sufficiency,\nthere is no greed—\neven with coarse food and gourd-drinking,\nhe stands proud and self-sufficient—\nthis is wealth.\nWith unremitting effort and perseverance,\nself-aware and self-mastered,\nhis resolve never wavers—\nthis is true purpose.\n\n**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**\nStrength comes from action.\nIf a man diligently pursues the Dao,\nthe Dao responds to him.\n\n**荣 (Róng) says:**\nHe who knows his place—\nthough he drinks from a gourd, he is rich.\nHe who covets gain—\nthough he hoards a hundred fortunes, he is poor.\nAdorning oneself and striving with vigor—\nthis is resolute action.\nFirm faith in the Dao, ever deepening—\nthis is true purpose.\n\nAccording to the *Nanhua Jing* [Southern Flower Scripture]:\n*Zengzi*, dwelling in Wei, wrapped himself in rags,\nhis face swollen and emaciated,\nhis hands and feet calloused,\nhe went three days without fire,\na decade without new clothes.\nHis crown’s ribbon frayed,\nhis sleeves torn to the elbow,\nhis sandals worn to the heel,\nhe dragged his feet while singing *Shang* hymns—\nhis voice filled heaven and earth,\nas if struck from metal and stone.\nThe Son of Heaven could not make him a subject,\nthe feudal lords could not make him a friend.\nThus, he who nourishes his purpose forgets his form,\nhe who nourishes his form forgets gain—\nthis is the meaning of *contentment.*\n\n---\n\n**Fourth: Clarity in Accepting Death with Integrity**\nTo accept death without forgetting,\nto act in accordance with Heaven’s principle—\nhe who does not lose his place endures,\nhe who dies without perishing attains longevity.\n\n**御注 (Yù Zhù):**\nKnowing contentment and persevering,\nnever losing one’s place—\nthis is to endure in the Dao.\nAgain:\nDeath is the end of one’s appointed fate,\nperishing is the measure of untimely ruin,\nlongevity is the completion of one’s allotted span.\nHe who knows others and overcomes them\ninevitably invites calamity.\nHe who knows contentment and perseveres\nattains Heaven’s constant way.\nHe who attains Heaven’s constant way\ndies without perishing.\nThe completion of one’s span—\nthis is longevity.\n\n**御疏 (Yù Shū):**\nKnowing contentment and resolute action—\nthese are common practices.\nIf one does not lose his constant way,\nhe is one who endures in the Dao.\nAgain:\nHe who does not lose his place\ncan endure long.\nAgain:\nDeath is the end of one’s appointed fate,\nperishing is the measure of untimely ruin,\nlongevity is the completion of one’s allotted span.\nIf one submits to Heaven’s harmony,\ndoes not lose the natural flow,\nand departs in tranquility,\nhe completes his allotted span—\nthis is longevity.\nIf one is not driven onward,\nhis vital essence is incomplete—\nthough *Dan Bao* may have the complexion of an infant,\nthough *Zhang Yi* may boast noble stature,\nif they do not fulfill Heaven’s principle,\nhow can they be called long-lived?\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*“None are longer-lived than the stillborn child,\nwhile Pengzu is counted as untimely.”*\n\n**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**\nIf a man regulates himself,\ndoes not lose his place,\nand cherishes Heaven’s vital essence,\nhe can endure long.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Chapter on the Great Dao**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor the earlier text illuminated the sovereign who serves the Dao—\none who knows himself and masters himself.\nThis chapter reveals how to accomplish and magnify great deeds,\nall for the sake of the Dao, forgetting merit.\n\nWithin this gate, it is divided into three sections:\nFirst, it marks *“The Great Dao is vast”*—\nshowing that left and right have no boundaries.\nSecond, *“Merit accomplished, not possessed”*—\nillustrating that great and small cannot be named.\nThird, *“The Sage does not prize his body”*—\nto preserve the brilliance of great deeds.\n\n**First: Marking *“The Great Dao is vast”*—\nshowing that left and right have no constraints.**\n\nThe Four Sovereigns reside in eminence,\none as their leader.\nThe enlightened guide their vision,\nthe wise devise their plans.\nSeated in majesty at the Purple Palace,\nthey act without action and find fulfillment.\nHow much more so the Great Dao—\nvast and boundless,\nproviding for all things and nurturing life.\nThe River Above True Person soars on the hundred-zhang clouds,\nthe Huai Mountain Immortal chews the autumn *dan* osmanthus,\nthe Celestial Lord pays homage to *Ge Xuan* in the waters,\nand the Han Emperor meets the Celestial Official on the cloud path—\nthus it is known:\nIt can be to the left or to the right—\nthis is what is meant.\n\n**The Great Dao is boundless—\nit can be to the left or to the right.**\n*Commentary (御注):*\nThe Great Dao is boundless—\nunconstrained yet responsive to all things,\nleft and right without partiality.\n\n*Explanatory Commentary (御疏):*\n\"Boundless\" describes its unconstrained nature.\nThe Dao is neither yin nor yang,\nneither soft nor hard—\nboundless and unrestrained,\nresponding to all phenomena,\ncapable of left or right,\nwithout partiality.\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Dao has never had boundaries.\"*\n\n*River Master (河上公) says:*\n\"Boundless\" speaks of the Dao’s unfettered flow—\nvast and floating, like presence and absence,\nvisible yet elusive, spoken yet divergent,\nexhausting all yet never inadequate,\nlying in human use—\nthus it encompasses all within and without,\nleft and right alike,\nso it is said: *It can be to the left or to the right—\nyet cannot be confined to left or right.*\n\nAll things rely on it for life without complaint.\n*Explanatory Commentary:*\nAll things under Heaven depend on the Great Dao’s generative power\nto fulfill their nature,\nyet the Dao’s transformation is wondrous and heartless—\nthough things rely on it for life,\nthe Dao does not weary of the labor.\n\n*Alternative Explanation:*\nThings do not reject the Dao.\n\n*River Master says:*\n\"Rely\" means \"depend upon,\"\n\"complaint\" means \"avoidance.\"\nThings truly depend on the Perfect Dao for their formation,\nyet the Dao forms them without avoidance.\n\n---\n**Second: When deeds are complete, one does not claim them—\nilluminating the difficulty of naming small or great.**\n\nDeeds are complete yet not claimed as one’s own.\n*Commentary:*\nThings rely on the Dao’s spontaneous action for their transformation,\nyet the Dao does not weary of the labor,\nits functions fully realized—\nit does not claim them as its own.\n\n*Explanatory Commentary:*\n\"Deeds\" refers to the generative function.\nThe Great Dao’s work of nurturing life is complete,\nyet it does not regard the things it creates as its own.\n\n*Alternative Explanation:*\nThough the Dao’s creation is complete,\nits deeds, though complete, are never claimed—\nthis is the forgetting of deeds.\n\n*Further Explanation:*\nIt transforms all beings,\nits subtle work silently accomplished,\nyet the merit is attributed to the things themselves—\nthus it does not claim deeds or names.\n\n---\nIt cherishes all things yet does not rule them,\nconstantly without desire—\nthis is what makes it *not* small.\n*Commentary:*\nIt nurtures all things yet does not dominate them;\ntoward things, it has no desire—\nthus it can be called *not* small.\n\n*Explanatory Commentary:*\nThis is a rhetorical inversion.\nTo say \"it can be called small\"\nis to say it *cannot* be called small.\nThe Dao generates and nurtures all things to maturity\nwithout ruling over them,\nclothing and covering all things,\nyet without desire—\nhow could this be the Dao’s narrowness?\nThus, to say \"it can be called small\"\nis to say it *cannot* be called small.\n\n*Further Explanation:*\n\"Clothing and covering\" means nurturing.\nThough it nurtures all things,\nit conceals its virtue and hides its name,\nserene and formless,\nthus not ruling—\nthough it seems minute,\nby this reasoning, it is *not* small.\n\n---\nAll things return to it yet it does not rule—\nthis is what makes it *not* great.\n*Commentary:*\nIt cherishes them, so all things return to it;\nthough there are myriad differences among things,\nit does not rule—\nthus it can be called *not* great.\nTo say it cannot be called great\nis neither small nor great—\nthus it is difficult to name.\n\n*Explanatory Commentary:*\n\"All things return to it\" refers to the Dao’s generative function.\nThough all things return to the Dao,\nthe Dao does not rule—\nhow could this not be vast and great?\nThus it is said: *It can be called great.*\n\n---\nSince it can be to the left or to the right,\nit is neither small nor great—\nthus it is difficult to name.\n\n*Commentary:*\nThere are myriad differences among things—\nthis is from *Zhuangzi*.\n\n*Further Explanation:*\nThe Dao can grow and nurture things,\nlike the great sea or vast valleys—\nthough things return to it,\nit does not rule over them.\nSince it does not rule,\ncan it be called great?\nThus it cannot be called great.\n\n---\n**Third: The Sage does not prize his body—\nto preserve the brilliance of great deeds.**\n\nThus the Sage never claims greatness,\nand so achieves greatness.\n\n*Commentary:*\nTherefore, the Sage follows the Dao and forgets deeds,\nnever seeking his own brilliance,\nand so accomplishes his great deeds.\n\n*Explanatory Commentary:*\nThe

chapter follows,\nrevealing that those who forget deeds\nare where all things turn.\nWithin this chapter, the text has three layers:\nFirst, it clarifies that all things return to it for benefit,\nSecond, it uses the analogy of bait to illustrate\nthe subtle, ineffable principle of teaching,\nThird, it shows that it is neither form nor sound,\nyet its wondrous use is inexhaustible.\n\n---\n**First: Clarifying that all things return for benefit.**\n\nThe Five Peaks manifest their forms,\nwith Tai Mountain as the longest.\nThe Three Powers establish their ranks,\nwith the Sage Ruler in eminence.\nWhen the halter is held, all eyes follow;\nwhen the pivot is grasped, all directions align—\nthis is *holding the Great Symbol*.\nUnder Heaven, all return to it.\nIts virtue of emptiness and forgetting is vast,\nits seated teachings are great—\nhow could it compare to\nYang Spring’s White Snow,\nor *Ying* melodies performed in vain,\nor red bait luring fish without substance?\nThus it is known:\nThe flavor of profound speech is subtle,\nyet common scholars embrace it without understanding;\nthe resonance of the golden bell is pure,\nyet fools seek it and rarely find it.\nIf not for those who hold the Great Symbol,\nwho else could embody it?\n\n「Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven come forth.  *[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, to govern all under Heaven, all things return and follow.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  This speaks of the ruler holding the Great Dao to govern all under Heaven—without action or affairs, things flourish in their natural order.  Observing the sun and winds, all return to the Dao, thus it is said that all under Heaven come forth.*\n\n*River Master said:  \"Holding\" means guarding.  \"Symbol\" is the Dao/Way.  The Sage guards the Great Dao, and thus all people under Heaven turn their hearts and follow.*\n\n*Rong said:  The Great Symbol is formless, the formless being the vast and empty Dao.  \"Holding\" means to focus and uphold oneself within the realm of profound virtue, to concentrate one’s heart at the gate of quiet seclusion.  When one follows the Dao, all things return, hence it is said that all under Heaven come forth.*\n\n*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  \"Holding\" means upholding, yet this is not holding while holding—it is upholding without upholding anything.  The Great Symbol is like the great Dao’s law and image, that is, the Sage from the previous chapter who upholds the formless Symbol, always skillfully rescuing all things.  Thus, all under Heaven come forth and follow.  The *Zhuangzi* says:  \"The Sage stands without instruction, sits without discussion, emptiness brings forth, fullness returns—Confucius would lead all under Heaven to follow him.\"  This is the same.  When all come forth without harm, peace and tranquility prevail.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, all under Heaven come forth and follow, just as when a household has music and food, passing travelers will stop and stay.  This is a metaphor.*\n\n*River Master said:  \"Bait\" is beauty.  The passing traveler is one and the same—if one can find beauty and joy in the Dao, then they will stop and stay.  \"One\" means to depart from excess and dwell in emptiness, drifting like a passing traveler.*\n\n*Rong said:  The five tones of music are the \"bait\" of joy.  The eight delicacies of food are the \"bait\" of taste.  A hundred years of life is but a passing traveler.  \"Stop\" means to linger, to depend.  To return and follow the Dao, one may attain peace and tranquility.  But if beings do not awaken, few will remain—only those who fix their hearts on strings and pipes, using them to indulge their emotions, or who cling to orchids and cassia, relying on these for comfort, cannot uphold the Symbol.  To seek tranquility is difficult indeed.*\n\n*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  Music is the tones of strings and pipes, the five notes of *guan, shang, jiao, zhi, yu*.  Bait is the savor of food and drink.  Music has pleasing sounds, bait has flavors to delight in—thus even transient travelers, upon encountering them, will stop and linger in love.  The Dao’s utterance is subtle, without taste—*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, to govern all under Heaven, all things return and follow.  The governance is without form, yet its efficacy is boundless.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Sage upholds the Great Dao, and thus all under Heaven’s people turn their hearts and follow.  Governing oneself without harming clarity, then the body is at peace and longevity is assured.*\n\n*Rong said:  When the misty clouds spread and all things are nourished, when the fragrant rains descend and every plant thrives—this is but the benefit of the Dao’s embrace, without harm.  The principle of non-harm: how does it manifest in governance?  When body and spirit remain undisturbed, there is ease; when life and death are indistinct, there is tranquility; when all is harmoniously interconnected, there is great peace.*\n\n*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  \"Tranquility\" is greatness.  When the common folk come to the Sage’s dwelling, all gain benefit without harm.  The benefit they gain is the peace and greatness of the teachings of the Mahayana.  Non-harm reveals the skillful means of suffering; peace and tranquility speak of harmony and delight.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Dao’s transformation is without action, subtle and balanced—neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is not seen or heard, yet its pure influence prevails, and each year there is abundance.  The governance is harmonious and flourishing, all things grow and thrive, the myriad beings radiant and complete.  Hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Dao’s governance is subtle and balanced, neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is not seen or heard, yet each year there is abundance, the pure winds harmonious and unrestrained.  All that moves and grows flourishes, the myriad beings radiant and complete—hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.

When the Dao/Way is upheld to still the mind, there are no words or teachings at first—thus it is invisible when gazed upon, inaudible when listened to.  Yet the pure winds spread widely, all things harmonious and tranquil, with abundance each year—thus its efficacy is boundless.*\n\n*Exhausted* means *complete*.  The Dao’s transformation is without action, subtle and balanced—neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is invisible when gazed upon, inaudible when listened to.  Yet each year there is abundance, the pure winds harmonious and unrestrained.  All that moves and grows flourishes, the myriad beings radiant and complete—hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*\n\nThe Master of the Yellow River said:\n*\"To gaze upon it is not to see\"*—*\"see\"* means *to obtain*. The Dao is formless; unlike the five colors—blue, red, white, black, and yellow—it cannot be grasped by sight. *\"To listen to it is not to hear\"*—the Dao is unlike the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—which can be heard by the ear. *\"Its use cannot be exhausted\"*—when the Dao is applied to govern a state, the nation grows wealthy and the people flourish; when applied to cultivate the self, life is prolonged without end.\n\nHonor said: *\"Exhausted\"* means *complete*. What is visible to the eye is dazzled by hues of green and yellow; what the ear hears is deceived by tones of *gong* and *zhi*; what the heart covets is blinded by treasures and riches. Though treasures serve utility, their use is finite. Though sounds may please, the deaf remain distant. Though colors may charm, the blind are near. Thus, one who knows to cease indulging in pleasures finds rest.\n\nYet the Dao of tranquility and non-action—though unseen by the eye—governs with penetrating clarity, though unheard by the ear—discerns with profound acuity. Though the mind cannot fathom it, those attuned to it act without depletion. The common and the Daoist differ thus; those bound by gain and harm are as such.\n\nMaster Cheng’s commentary:\n*\"To gaze upon it is not to see\"*—the Supreme Dao is profound and mysterious, transcending form and color, unlike food and drink, which cannot be sought through mere visual perception. *\"To listen to it is not to hear\"*—the Great Sound is subtle beyond tone, its essence not like *gong* or *jiao*; it is not grasped by the ears as bells and drums are. The words of the Sage, though spoken, are but examples of their meaning. *\"Its use cannot be exhausted\"*—*\"exhausted\"* means *complete*. The words of the Supreme Dao are serene and boundless, neither sound nor color, transcending sight and hearing. Like a mirror’s heart, it reflects all that comes; like a valley’s echo, it responds as it is stirred. Thus, the use of the Dao, though seemingly without action, is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: \"When One Would Contract It\"**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounds on the Great Sage’s forgetfulness of merit as the refuge of all things. It now reveals the Sage’s use of expedient means in forgetfulness of merit.\n\nThe Sage adapts to myriad paths; the responses are not singular. Sometimes, following the circumstances, they teach lesser doctrines; sometimes, arousing aspiration, they expound the Great Vehicle. Thus, there are true and expedient bodies, real and expedient wisdom. They employ expedient means to honor inferior disciples and uphold the real to guide superior ones. Within expedient and real, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority. This chapter briefly elucidates this meaning.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinctions unfold:\n1. The expedient Dao benefits beings, expanding the paths of governance.\n2. Measuring the two wisdoms, it clarifies that expedient does not surpass the real.\n3. It demonstrates that the expedient Dao cannot be revealed to all.\n\n**First: The expedient Dao benefits beings, expanding the paths of governance.**\nThe Great Dao governs all actions, yet the foolish calculate in vain—like one drinking from the river on the verge of death, wearying in futile pursuit of the sun. To absorb dew and preserve life, one rejoices in the hope of ascending to the clouds. Spring’s fragrance and summer’s lushness unfold in their seasons; rain disperses, clouds gather, and the seven celestial officials align. Sometimes, reversal brings harmony, illustrating the sage’s clear laws. Sometimes, transformation renews, teaching the virtuous to retreat quietly.\n\nWhat of the blind? Though ignorant, they linger in the gates of affection and desire, inevitably losing the realm of stillness. Like a fish escaping water or a sharp blade shown to all, such common beings—how can their lamentations be exhausted?\n\nWhen one would contract it, they must first fully expand it.\n\nThe Way that would contract must first fully expand it.\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it.\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it.\nThe Way that would take must first fully give it.\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**.\n\n**Commentary:** The Classic says: *\"Upright speech seems contrary.\"* The *Yijing* says: *\"Diverge to exercise authority.\"* Authority is that which, though contrary to the Way, aligns with principle.\n\nThus, the sage exercises authority while valuing alignment with principle, while the petty man uses it for deceit and guile. Confucius said: *\"One may stand with him, but not yet exercise authority with him—truly so.\"* Therefore, the Old Master in the previous chapter spoke of holding the Great Image—this is called **substance**. This chapter follows with contraction—this is called **authority**.\n\nMeasuring the roots of sentient beings, he thus covers and reverses with substance and authority, compelling them to reach the realm of nature and life. Yet the deluded claim this is not the Dao’s intent—how deeply they err and fail to awaken!\n\nWhen one would contract the emotions of sentient beings, first expand them, exhausting their extravagant desires, so that they become ensnared in love and lust—then contraction follows. The meanings of strength and weakness are similarly applied.\n\nThis Dao is most subtle, yet its effects are clearly manifest—hence, it is called **subtle luminosity**.\n\n**Exegesis:** *Teru* (合) means to contract. This reveals the Sage’s use of authority to transform and guide sentient beings.\n\nSince people have dull and sharp roots, and teaching has both authority and substance, the Sage measures the roots of sentient beings. Thus, with authority and substance, he covers and reverses, revealing the truth: sharp-rooted beings, seeing virtue, turn toward it; having faults, they contract. A slight demonstration suffices to reach their depths. Dull-rooted beings, long mired in delusion, unless transformed through authority, cannot be led to return. Therefore, when contracting the emotions of those who would expand them, first expand them, exhausting their extravagant desires—then they will naturally contract.\n\nThe meanings of strength and weakness are likewise so. Extend this principle, and none will fail.\n\nAt first hearing, one may take this as contrary to the Dao, but upon deep understanding, the purpose of authority and substance becomes clear. Hence the commentary: *\"The sage exercises authority while valuing alignment with principle; the petty man uses it for deceit and guile.\"* The following text further states that it should not be shown to others—precisely because authority is so difficult to wield.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\nThe Way that would contract must first fully expand it—first expanding it is to exhaust their licentiousness.\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—first strengthening them is to make them suffer calamity.\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—first elevating them is to make them proud and perilous.\nThe Way that would take must first fully give it—first giving it is to exhaust their greedy hearts.\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**—these four methods are subtle in their Dao, yet their effects are clearly manifest.\n\n**Yan** said:\nThese four methods show that when the Sage is extinguished, virtue naturally arises; when wisdom is abandoned, transformation naturally proceeds; contracting the hearts of all under Heaven while making them expand; weakening the resolve of all under Heaven while making them strong.\n\n**Rong** said:\nThe Way that would contract must first fully expand it—when one would close the *Gui* (兑) and shut the door, the foolish do not comply. Thus, one opens the *Gui* and accomplishes the matter, exhausting them until they cease.\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—when one would still their fierce and mighty hearts, one indulges their rigid resolve. The weak perish, the strong endure—suffering reaches its limit and must stop.\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—when one would decay, it instead flourishes; things reach their extreme and naturally reverse.\nThe Way that would take must first fully give it—when one would take away evil, if evil deeds are not removed, evil accumulates and destroys the self. Only then do they awaken in the moment.\n\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**—though the Sage’s authority seems at first unlike teaching, upon examining its principle, it holds profound potential, most subtly luminous and clearly beneficial. Hence, it is called **subtle luminosity**.\n\nIn eighty-one chapters, the transformations and guidance are broadly expounded, yet common emotions cling, and their grasp differs. When substance is demonstrated and they do not comply, authority is used to transform them, compelling them to return.\n\nThe Mysterious Teaching is profound and far-reaching, fitting for all. Authority is explained first, substance clarified afterward. To contract, one opens the Way’s transformation; to weaken worldly emotions, one strengthens their immortal essence; to abandon evil intent, one offers the true path; to take away evil deeds, one gives them virtuous conduct.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Way that would contract must first fully expand it—*teru* (歙) means to gather, to contract. When exercising authority to transform all classes of beings, those who would not be contracted by substance must first be expanded and indulged, their licentiousness exhausted—then they may be contracted.\n\nIn the past, when the Old Master entered the west to transform the barbarians of *Jibin*, he first indulged their savagery, then transformed them with the Dao—this is the case. The intricate details are fully recorded in the *Wen Shi Nei Zhuan*.\n\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—when one would lead them to the Dao’s gentle weakness, one must first exhaust their strength, then demonstrate the yielding and soft.\n\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—when one would abandon their brutal and untamed nature, one must first indulge their ferocity and violence. Once their violence is exhausted, it can be abandoned. This is as when the barbarian king unleashed his poisonous wrath, burning and drowning the Old Master—yet water and fire did not harm him—only then did he teach him the Dao.\n\nThe Way that would take must first fully give it—first indulging their evil, calling it \"giving,\" then leading them to goodness, calling it \"taking.\" Thus, the Old Master first displayed his mundane form to indulge their rigidity, then revealed his divine powers—only then did the barbarians submit, allowing their ferocity to be taken away and leading them to the virtuous path.\n\nThese four paired meanings are similarly structured, differing only in shallow and deep layers. Those of superior capacity hear substance and immediately awaken; those of inferior roots require authority. This is the method of increasing the law and eliminating delusion.\n\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**—though the Sage’s authority is subtle and profound, its effects are clearly verified.\n\n「Again it is said: *微隐* means subtle and hidden; *明*, wisdom. This is the subtle and hidden Way of wisdom.\n\n**The Second Section** explains the comparison of two kinds of wisdom: the wisdom of the Way is not inferior to that of authority. The gentle overcomes the rigid.\n\n**御注** states: The *巽* (compliant) can wield authority, and when authority is wielded, it can control all things. Hence, it is known that the gentle and compliant can indeed overcome the rigid and strong.\n\n**御疏** elaborates: The *易* (Classic of Changes) says: *\"巽以行权\"* (The compliant can wield authority). If one desires to clarify that *巽* (compliant) is humble and yielding, then one can practice the Way of authority. Therefore, to make something *翕* (converge), one must first give it *张* (expansion); to make it *弱* (weak), one must first give it *强* (strength). Ultimately, when one leads it to *翕弱* (convergence and weakness), it is the Way of gentleness triumphing over rigidity and strength. Hence, it is said: *The gentle overcomes the rigid.*\n\n**河上公** states: *The gentle endure long, while the rigid perish first.*\n\n**荣** says: The Way of authority follows without resistance, hence it is called *gentle*. Yet it must ultimately control the rigid, hence it is said to *overcome*.\n\n**成疏** explains: *Gentle* refers to the true Way; *rigid*, to the wisdom of authority. To teach those difficult to convert, one must rely on the wisdom of authority. When comparing the two wisdoms, the true wisdom of the Way surpasses that of authority.\n\n**The Third Section** illustrates through analogies that the Way of authority cannot be revealed to all.\n\n*A fish cannot be removed from its depths; the state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people.*\n**御注** clarifies: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to the Way of authority. This states that the Way of authority cannot be revealed to those unworthy of it, hence the analogy: *If a fish loses its pool, it will be captured by men. If the Way of authority is revealed to those unworthy, they will seize it and use it for deception.*\n\n**御疏** further elucidates: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to the Way of authority. A fish in water is like a ruler wielding authority; a fish losing its water is like a ruler losing his authority, and then he will be captured. If the Way of authority is falsely revealed to those unworthy, they will misuse it and practice deception.*\n\n**河上公** says: *A fish cannot be removed from its depths*—if a fish is removed from its depths, it is like losing rigidity and gaining gentleness, and thus can no longer control. *The state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people*—the sharpest tools refer to the Way of authority. Those who wield authority in governing the state should not reveal it to their ministers, nor should those who practice the Way reveal it to those unworthy of it.*\n\n**荣** says: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. A fish swims in the river and lake, relying on them for its livelihood. The Sage’s greatest treasure depends on the subtle and hidden Way of authority. A fish cannot lose its water, for losing it means the fish perishes. The sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people, for revealing them brings peril. Hence it is said: *One can lead people by the Way, but not make them know it*—this shows that the Way of authority must not be entrusted to the wrong hands.\n\n**成疏** concludes: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to authority. A fish hides in water, and authority hides in the heart, so nothing can harm it. A fish loses its water and is captured by others; authority revealed to the people is controlled by them. Hence, it cannot be done.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Way is Ever Without Action**\n\nThis chapter marks the third section of the text, clarifying the ultimate convergence.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text opens two distinct themes: the first converges the essence of the Way, revealing its tranquil stillness while ever in motion; the second converges the essence of the student, displaying the profound mystery of the highest subtlety.\n\n**The First Convergence: The Essence of the Way—Revealing Tranquility While Ever in Motion**\n\nThe wondrous Way of non-action is exalted and detached from worldly affairs, not enduring forever, yet dwelling in obscurity is not dim. The radiant virtue encompasses all life, working unceasingly yet unperceived. The profound roots remain silent, yet all things resonate with it—who can discern? Unlocking the hidden depths of the jade-like treasury, the celestial scriptures ascend to the *上清* (Upper Purity) and *太清* (Supreme Purity). Manifesting the teachings of the jade cabinet, the realms of *罪福* (guilt and fortune) span the *三涂* (Three Stygian Realms) and *九夜* (Nine Nights of Torment). The lonely spirits wail along the *泉路* (path to the underworld), while the stagnant *魄* (ethereal souls) languish in the *苦庭* (court of suffering). Without the great Way to deliver them, who can rescue the lost and bring forth clarity? Though called profound and silent, yet nothing is left undone—teaching the common folk, the power of the Way is now revealed.\n\nThe Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. If rulers could uphold it, all things would transform naturally.\n\n**御注** states: The wondrous origin is pure and tranquil, hence it is ever without action. All things depend on it for existence, yet nothing is left undone—thus all things transform naturally. The ruler’s non-action leads to the people’s simplicity and purity.\n\n**御疏** elaborates: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The nature of the Way is pure and tranquil, its wondrous origin serene and still—hence it is ever without action. All things rely on it for creation, responding with sensation when moved—hence nothing is left undone. Those who act will inevitably have things they cannot do; those who do not act will have nothing they cannot accomplish. If rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. Rulers who guard the pure and tranquil Way, without action or affairs, will see all things naturally respond and transform. The people will then become simple and virtuous through their ruler’s good teaching.\n\n**河上公** says: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The Way’s constancy lies in its non-action. If rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. This means that if rulers guard the Way, all things will transform in accordance with it.\n\n**成疏** explains: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The Way of constancy is silent and tranquil, yet its application arises spontaneously to respond to all things. The earlier sentence is the origin; the later, its manifestation. This reveals that though the Way’s origin is profound and silent, its motion is tranquil and responsive—clarifying the interplay of motion and stillness.\n\nIf rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. The sovereigns of the *万乘* (ten-thousand chariots) and the five ranks of rulers, if they uphold this Way, will see the *八荒* (eight remote regions) and all nations naturally follow and transform. Students are the same. The reason for emphasizing rulers is that their transformation benefits many and spreads widely.\n\n**The Second Convergence: The Essence of the Student—Displaying the Profound Mystery of the Highest Subtlety**\n\nWhen one seeks to act after transformation, I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity.\n\n**御注** states: This speaks of those who, having followed their ruler’s transformation through the Way of non-action, now wish to act with worldly deeds. I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity.\n\n**The Second Convergence: The Essence of the Student—Displaying the Profound Mystery of the Highest Subtlety (Continued)**\n\nThe nameless simplicity is the Dao.\n\n**御疏** states: The nameless simplicity is the Dao. Those who wish to act are those who desire to engage in worldly deeds. *吾* refers to the rulers themselves. It means that once people have received the benevolent teachings and been transformed, the ruler’s virtue of non-action brings purity and stillness. Yet if they still wish to act and engage in worldly deeds, I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity, so that their hearts remain pure and undisturbed by such desires.\n\n**河上公** says: *吾* means the self. The nameless simplicity refers to the Dao. After all things have been transformed, if one then seeks to engage in clever artifices, the rulers must govern and pacify them with virtue and the Dao.\n\n**成疏** states: *作* means to begin cultivation. *朴* is the Dao. It speaks of those who, having first followed the transformation and begun cultivation, inevitably harbor desires for fruition and rewards. Once these desires arise, one must use the nameless, simple Dao to calm their hearts, so that they do not cling to worldly attachments. This is the way of dispelling the worldly with emptiness.\n\nThe nameless simplicity will also not desire. Without desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony.\n\n**御注** states: Once the ruler has restrained the people with the nameless simplicity, one must not cling to this nameless simplicity and leave traces behind. Otherwise, people may seek these traces and lose their original nature, falling back into worldly action. Thus, even this nameless simplicity must be forgotten—without desire, one forgets desire. In tranquil purity, the world will naturally align in harmony.\n\n**御疏** states: The nameless simplicity will also not desire. Earlier, it was said that even if common people desire to engage in worldly deeds, the ruler will restrain them with the nameless simplicity. Now, it is said that even this nameless simplicity should not desire. This is to prevent the ruler from clinging to the nameless simplicity, lest they awaken desires in the people, leading them to seek traces and lose their original nature, thereby returning to worldly action. Such desires would be equal and indistinguishable.\n\nThus, initially, the nameless simplicity is used to restrain the desires of the people. Once the people’s desires are eliminated, the sage’s own nameless simplicity is also abandoned. It is like medicine used to treat an illness—once the sickness is cured, the medicine is forgotten; or a boat used to cross water—once the crossing is complete, the boat is left behind. If one guards the boat after crossing the water or continues to take medicine after the illness is gone, not only will they fail to reach the other shore, but they may also incur new suffering. Without desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony. When the nameless simplicity no longer desires, the desire for it is also forgotten, leading to tranquil purity—this is called *了出* (realization and transcendence).\n\nThe ruler governs through non-action, and the people follow their nature and transform from below. Without the need for teaching or commands, the world becomes peaceful and harmonious. Hence, it is said that the world will naturally align in harmony.\n\n**河上公** says: The nameless simplicity will also not desire. The ruler governs and pacifies with virtue and the Dao, and yet the ruler should also not desire. Therefore, one must transform them with the pure Dao.\n\nThe world will naturally align in harmony for those who can do this.\n\n**成疏** states: The nameless simplicity will also not desire, not merely refraining from desire for worldly laws but also from desire for this nameless simplicity itself. Earlier, it was said to dispel worldly attachments with emptiness; now, it is said to dispel the emptiness with worldly existence. With both worldly and emptiness forgotten, one attains the Dao.\n\nWithout desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony. Stillness is cessation. Earlier, worldly attachments were dispelled with the nameless simplicity; now, the desire for it is dispelled with non-desire. When worldly attachments and emptiness are both forgotten, desire is eliminated, and one attains the Dao. This is the process of dispelling again and again, the profound within the profound—what is called *探幽索隐，穷理尽性* (probing the depths and seeking the hidden, exhausting principle and attaining nature).\n\nSince all dharmas are ultimately true and real, ladders, scaffolding, and all contrivances are none other than the highest Dao. Therefore, it is said that the world will naturally align in harmony. This sentence seals the gate of all profound mysteries.\n\n**End of Volume Ten of the *Moral and Mysterious Classic*—Commentary on the *Profound Virtue***\n**Beginning of Volume Eleven of the *Moral and Mysterious Classic*—Commentary on the *Profound Virtue***\n\n**Commentary on the *Profound Virtue* – Chapter Thirty-Eight: *Upper Virtue Does Not Virtue***\n\n**Imperial Commentary and Exegesis of the Tang Xuanzong**\n**Commentary by Lord Yan Junping of He Shang, Li Rong**\n**Exegesis by Master Cheng Xuan of Xihua**\n**Compiled by Qiang Sici of Mengyang**\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* is divided into two volumes: the upper text elucidates the *Dao*, the lower text expounds on *virtue*. Yet the upper text also encompasses both *Dao* and *virtue*, though it prioritizes *Dao* as the primary and *virtue* as secondary. Similarly, the lower text also encompasses both, but here *virtue* takes precedence while *Dao* becomes secondary. Thus, the text is structured as *Dao De Jing* (Classic of the *Dao* and *Virtue*), with *Dao* and *virtue* as its twin pillars.\n\nThis single scroll comprises forty-two chapters, its meaning branching into three distinct divisions:\nThe first chapter establishes the foundation of *virtue*,\nChapters two through forty-two expound extensively on the principles of *virtue*,\nThe final chapter synthesizes the preceding teachings.\n\n**First Division: Establishing the Foundation of *Virtue***\n\nWithin this chapter, four further distinctions unfold:\n1. Distinguishing the *virtue* of the upper and lower realms, dispelling erroneous fixation,\n2. Clarifying the *virtue* of *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), and *li* (rites), illustrating the shift from purity to corruption across ages,\n3. Exposing the superficiality of later developments, urging a return to the root,\n4. Denouncing *li* (rites) as the origin of hollow pretense, guiding proper discernment and alignment.\n\n**1. Distinguishing the *Virtue* of the Upper and Lower Realms, Dispelling Erroneous Fixation**\n\nIndeed, *yi* (righteousness) is subordinate to *Dao*, while *Dao* holds supreme dignity. The transformations of Tang and Yu were pure and beautiful, their governance rooted in *wuwei* (non-action), their realm a field of spontaneous harmony where none boasted of virtue or sought praise. They harmonized with the purity of Heaven and Earth, steadied the rectitude of sun and moon. In their midst, things flourished without effort, their actions costing nothing—truly, *upper virtue does not virtue*.\n\nMysterious beyond measure, yet humble and radiant, their *Dao* aligned with the first of the Three Sovereigns. Though they acted, they remained still. When the age of Lu Lu (the legendary era of simplicity) faded, the practice of *li* (rites) and *ren* (benevolence) emerged. As corruption spread, laws became rigid, and the *Dao* of the two *Zhuans* (ancient officials) was abandoned. The wise and sagely grew obscured, and Ji Chang (King Wen of Zhou) suffered seven years of misfortune—yet he never forgot that *yi* (righteousness) was subordinate to *Dao*. Thus, he endured poverty while dwelling in splendor, losing the subtlety of the whole. Even the foolish failed to discern this.\n\n**Upper virtue does not virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.**\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*Upper virtue does not virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.*\n*Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it lacks virtue.*\n*Virtue* is the manifestation of the *Dao*.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"When things attain their natural state, it is called virtue.\"*\nIn ancient times, the pure and unadorned *virtue* was not yet manifest, and thus there was no *virtue* to be named—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* Yet the pure *virtue* did not disperse; through *wuwei*, its influence remained clear—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"*\n\nWhen *virtue* declined, its functions became more pronounced. Though the heart still embodied the *Dao*, its actions leaned toward *wei* (action). *Virtue* could now be named—hence, *\"does not lose virtue.\"* Yet because its traces leaned toward ostentation, it was coarser than the upper—hence, *\"and thus it lacks virtue.\"*\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\n*Upper* refers to the ancient age.\n*Virtue* is the manifestation of *Dao*.\nIn the upper antiquity, pure and unadorned, *wuwei* governed all. The essence of the *Dao* was its foundation, and all things flourished naturally—this was the pure *virtue* of antiquity, hence *\"upper virtue.\"* Yet its *virtue* was so profound that none could name it—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* Yet the harmonious winds prevailed, and all things thrived—*virtue* remained complete—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**\n*Upper virtue does not virtue*—*upper virtue* refers to the sovereigns of the most ancient era, whose *virtue* was so vast that names could not contain it. *\"Does not virtue\"* means they did not govern through *virtue* but followed nature spontaneously, nurturing life—thus their *virtue* was unseen, hence *\"does not virtue.\"* *\"And thus it possesses virtue\"* signifies that their *virtue* aligned with Heaven and Earth, and the harmonious *qi* flowed, allowing the people to thrive.\n\n**Commentary by Li Rong:**\nThe ancient *Dao* was established in the boundless void as its heart, its essence condensed into unity. It required no effort to transform all things, nor did it seek the names of courtesy—how could there be conflict with arms? Though it resided at the pinnacle, it was neither contentious nor named. *Wuwei* was its nature—hence, *\"upper virtue.\"* It acted without reliance, achieved without claiming—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* It nourished all things, allowing them to flourish—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"* Internally, it illuminated *virtue* in harmony with the *Dao*, its meaning thus worthy of reverence—hence, *\"upper virtue.\"* The *Dao* was formless, *virtue* was subtle—its light was concealed, its use was hidden—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* Though concealed in use, its use was indeed use; though hidden in light, its light was indeed light. With use and light manifest, it benefited all—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"*\n\n**Exegesis by Master Cheng Xuan:**\n*Upper* signifies transcendence and excellence—it is the name for what surpasses. *Virtue* means attainment, its meaning rooted in mastery. Those of *upper virtue* subtly align with the *Dao*, their wisdom merging with reality, transcending gain and loss. Thus, *\"does not virtue.\"* Their wisdom merges with reality—thus, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"* When *virtue* is present, loss is dispelled; when *virtue* is absent, gain is dispelled.\n\n**Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it lacks virtue.**\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis speaks of the decline of pure winds and the waning of *virtue*. Thus, the Sage praised the spirit of *wuwei*, yet the people clung to its traces. To cling to traces is inferior—hence, *\"lower virtue.\"* When traces became manifest, *virtue* could be named—hence, *\"does not lose virtue.\"* Though *virtue* was named, its traces leaned toward ostentation. The flaw of ostentation disrupted the purity—hence, *\"and thus it lacks virtue.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**\n*Lower virtue does not lose virtue*—*lower virtue* refers to the sovereigns of the *Hao* (Emperor Yao) era, whose *virtue* did not reach the heights of the upper—hence, *\"lower virtue.\"* *\"Does not lose virtue\"* means their *virtue* was visible, their achievements named. *\"And thus it lacks virtue\"* is because their titles and personhood were now defined.\n\n**Commentary by Li Rong:**\nThe winds of *Dao* and *virtue* were nearly lost, and the transformations of *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) were about to arise.\n\nWhen words and deeds became manifest, the age grew corrupt—hence, *\"lower virtue.\"*\n\nTo take *virtue* as *virtue*, to take achievement as achievement, to rely on *virtue* while boasting of deeds—hence, *\"does not lose virtue.\"*\n\nTo grasp *virtue* in words yet fail to embody non-action—hence, *\"and thus it lacks virtue.\"*\n\nThose who inwardly illuminate the body’s unity with emptiness and stillness—this is *virtue*’s summit.\nThose whose affairs are entangled in multiplicity—this is *virtue*’s base.\n\nWhen fixation clings to the heart, hence *\"does not lose virtue.\"*\nBut fixation leads to loss—hence, *\"and thus it lacks virtue.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Master Cheng:**\nNot yet reaching the ultimate, hence called *\"lower.\"*\nTo cling to *virtue* without forgetting—hence *\"does not lose.\"*\nNot yet able to merge in obscurity—hence *\"lacks virtue.\"*\n\n**On *Upper Virtue*:**\n*Upper virtue* acts without action, yet does nothing—\n**Imperial Gloss:** To know non-action and thus act is not the utmost.\nTo act without action through non-action—this is the utmost.\nThus, *upper virtue*’s non-action is not to conform to the beauty of non-action,\nbut to contain and nurture purity, naturally aligning with non-action—\nhence *\"yet does nothing,\"*\nfor here, both mind and trace are without action.\n\n**Imperial Citation:** This elucidates *upper virtue.*\n*Upper virtue* operates in hidden non-action, its purity undispersed—\nthus, no name or trace remains.\nNow, *upper virtue*’s non-action is but to contain and nurture purity,\nnaturally aligning with non-action,\nnot knowing the beauty of non-action to *do* non-action—\nhence *\"yet does nothing,\"*\nfor it is not merely without ostentation to boast,\nbut also without intent yet transforming naturally—\nthus the Gloss says: *\"Here, both mind and trace are without action.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**\n*Upper virtue* acts without action—speaking of *Dao*’s law as tranquil, doing nothing.\nYet *\"does nothing\"*—speaking of not relying on titles or names.\n\n**Commentary by Li Rong:**\n*\"With\"* means *\"to use.\"*\nThe Sage uses non-action to transform the people below,\nthe people use non-action to serve the Sage above.\n\n**Commentary by Master Cheng:**\n*\"With\"* means *\"to use.\"*\n*Upper virtue*’s non-action is rooted in the ultimate stillness,\nyet *\"does nothing\"*—its trace is used in subtle mystery.\nThis clarifies *\"non-action yet action,\"*\nfor action is itself non-action.\n\n**On *Lower Virtue*:**\n*Lower virtue* acts, yet has something to rely on—\n**Imperial Gloss:** *Lower virtue* acts—meaning though the mind is without action,\nits deeds are manifest and its traces lean toward action—\nhence *\"acts.\"*\nSpeaking of *lower virtue*’s non-action:\nit has a means to act, yet this acting is the mind’s non-action.\n\n**Imperial Citation:** This elucidates *lower virtue.*\n*Lower virtue* acts—meaning it follows the Sage’s beautiful non-action,\nyet *does* this non-action—\nhence *\"acts.\"*\nThough the mind desires non-action,\nin practice, it leans toward ostentation—\nhence *\"yet has something to rely on.\"*\nSpeaking of *lower virtue*’s acting:\nit has a means to act.\nThus the Gloss says: *\"The mind is without action, the trace is with action.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**\n*Lower virtue* acts—meaning it issues teachings and administers governance.\nYet *\"has something to rely on\"*—meaning it claims titles and names for itself.\n\n**Commentary by Li Rong:**\nThe Sage uses action to guide the people below,\nthe people also use action to serve the Sage above—\nhow so?\nGrass bends with the wind, drifting westward;\nshadows follow form, curving and straightening.\nThus, the ruler of all under heaven must not engage in excess,\nfor governance returns to emptiness and stillness.\nTeaching disciples must not violate propriety,\nfor loyalty and filial piety are its essence.\n\n**Commentary by Master Cheng:**\nThe mind does not forget *virtue*—hence called *\"acts.\"*\nYet progress still involves affairs—hence *\"has something to rely on.\"*\n\n**On *Upper Benevolence*:**\n*Upper benevolence* acts, yet has nothing to rely on—\n**Imperial Gloss:** *Benevolence* is the name for universal love.\nAs *lower virtue* declines, *upper benevolence* emerges—\nthus, universal love is *benevolence*, hence *\"acts.\"*\nTo practice *benevolence* while forgetting *benevolence*,\nalso desiring non-action—\nhence *\"yet has nothing to rely on,\"*\nfor here, the mind acts yet the trace is without action.\nMoreover, *upper benevolence* is called non-action\nbecause, though it seeks non-action, it aligns with higher righteousness—\nit cannot yet compare to *lower virtue*’s action.\n\n**Imperial Citation:** This further clarifies that when *Dao* declines, *benevolence* and *righteousness* arise.\n*Upper benevolence*—meaning *benevolence* as supreme, the rest following suit.\n*Benevolence* is the name for universal love—\nwhen *Dao* is in full practice, all things receive private blessings,\nbut as pure winds disperse, universal love takes root.\nNow, it clarifies why *benevolence* is universal love—\nhence *\"upper benevolence acts.\"*\nTo practice *benevolence* while forgetting *benevolence*:\nthough it says *\"do not seek repayment,\"*\nuniversal love is difficult to universalize,\nand partial kindness cannot fully win trust—\nthus, the mind is always engaged in affairs—\nhence *\"acts.\"*\nIn practice, it approaches non-action—\nhence *\"yet has nothing to rely on.\"*\nThus the Gloss says: *\"Here, the mind acts yet the trace is without action.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**\n*Upper benevolence* acts—meaning the sovereign who practices *benevolence*,\nwhose *benevolence* is supreme—hence *\"upper.\"*\n*\"Acts\"* refers to benevolent grace.\n*\"Yet has nothing to rely on\"*—meaning deeds accomplished, no claim to hold.\n\n**Commentary by Li Rong:**\n*Upper benevolence* acts yet has nothing to rely on,\n*upper righteousness* acts yet has something to rely on.\nUniversal love and broad bestowal—this is *benevolence*.\nRewarding the good and punishing the wicked—this is *righteousness*.\nConsistently upholding *virtue* and *power*—this is fitting for the Sage.\n*Upper virtue* and *lower virtue* reflect the differing transformations of corruption and purity.\nNon-action and action clarify the distinction between gain and loss in governance.\nThe designation of *lower virtue* as *\"acts\"* is the inferiority of *upper virtue*.\nThe designation of *upper benevolence* as *\"has nothing to rely on\"* is the superiority of *upper righteousness*.\n\n**Commentary by Master Cheng:**\n*Benevolence* is compassion—\nwith a mind to nurture, hence *\"acts.\"*\nNot demanding repayment, hence *\"has nothing to rely on.\"*\nStrictly speaking, *upper benevolence* does not reach *lower virtue*,\nyet compared to *righteousness*, *benevolence* prevails—\nhence *\"has nothing to rely on.\"*\nAmong the Three Treasures, compassion is first,\nthus within the Five *Virtues*, *benevolence* is paramount.\n\n**On *Upper Righteousness*:**\n*Upper righteousness* acts, yet has something to rely on—\n**Imperial Gloss:** *Righteousness* means to judge wrongs—\nmeaning it judges wrongs, hence *\"acts.\"*\n\n「When there are matters requiring the judgment of wrongs, the ruler must cut them off and order them to suit their proper measure—\nthus it is said *\"while having something to rely on,\"*\nfor both the mind and its traces are engaged in action.\n\n**Commentary by Master Cheng:**\n*Righteousness* is the proper measure—\nmeaning to regulate, judge, and cut off wrongs,\nso that all things attain their fitting place.\nWhen simplicity and purity are lost,\ndistinctions of right and wrong arise.\nTo judge wrongs and restore proper measure,\nthe ruler must act accordingly—\nthus it is said *\"Upper Righteousness acts,\"*\nmeaning the mind has the intent to judge wrongs,\nand there are reasons and means for its actions,\nhence *\"while having something to rely on.\"*\nTherefore, the Imperial Gloss states:\n*\"Here, both the mind and its traces are engaged in action.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"Upper Righteousness acts\"*—\nmeaning the ruler enforces righteousness through judgment and execution.\n*\"While having something to rely on\"*—\nmeaning he takes action for his own benefit,\nkills to establish his authority,\nand imposes taxes on the people to sustain himself.\n\n**Commentary by Master Cheng:**\n*Righteousness* is primarily about restraining evil and judging wrongs—\nthis is the essence of the precepts and disciplines in the *sutras*.\nYet the origin of these precepts is to accommodate the lower capacities of beings,\nand their implementation involves actions—\nthey have not yet ascended to the realm of emptiness and mystery,\nhence *\"while having something to rely on.\"*\n\n**On *Upper Rites/Courtesy*:**\nWhen *rites* are performed yet none respond,\nthe ruler rolls up his sleeves and enforces them.\n**Imperial Gloss:**\nIf the Six *Courtesies* (六紀) are not in harmony,\nthen *rites* are instituted to remedy the decline—\nthus it is said *\"he performs them.\"*\n*Rites* emphasize reciprocity—\nif none come in response, it is not proper *rites*.\nWhen *rites* are extended to others,\nyet they do not reciprocate,\nthe ruler rolls up his sleeves in anger—\nthus it is said *\"he rolls up his sleeves and enforces them.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Master He Shang Gong:**\n*\"Upper Rites acts\"*—\nmeaning the ruler, who upholds the highest *rites*,\nhas no superior in his establishment of rites and ceremonies.\n*\"None respond\"*—\nmeaning *rites*, though outwardly grand, are inwardly hollow,\ndecorative and burdensome,\nso that even a slight movement provokes mockery—\nthey cannot be properly followed.\n*\"He rolls up his sleeves and enforces them\"*—\nmeaning because the rites are too burdensome to follow,\nthe people and rulers alike grow angry and quarrel,\nthus rolling up their sleeves to provoke one another.\n\n**Honor says:**\nThe *rites* consist of the Three Hundred *Classics* and Three Thousand *Ceremonies*—\nwith these, the ruler instructs the people,\nhence *\"he performs them.\"*\nWhen *rites* become excessive, disorder follows—\nthe lower classes cannot uphold them,\nhence *\"none respond.\"*\nThis can be said to reflect the truth:\n*\"Trust is insufficient, leading to distrust.\"*\nTrust, when genuine, requires no words—\nbut distrust breeds anger and contention,\nthus the ruler rolls up his sleeves and rolls up his arms,\ndragging one another into conflict.\n\n**Commentary by Master Cheng:**\nWhen *rites* are performed yet none respond,\nit is because *rites* emphasize ceremonies and etiquette—\nthis is the practice of ceremonial fasting and observances in the *sutras*.\nMoreover, the *Dao* is pure and tranquil,\nits great symbol formless—\nyet now, simplicity is discarded in favor of ornamentation,\nsubstance is abandoned for superficiality,\nand the pursuit of ceremonial grandeur overshadows the essence of forgetting and detachment.\nThough these may serve as gradual teachings,\nthey fail to align with true principle—\nnot only do they contradict the *Dao* internally,\nbut externally, they cannot be properly followed by others.\nThus it is said *\"he performs them yet none respond.\"*\n*\"He rolls up his sleeves and enforces them\"*—\n*仍* (rén) means *\"to follow or adhere.\"*\n*Rites* emphasize reciprocity and mutual expectations—\nbecause the rites are shallow,\nthe ruler rolls up his sleeves in anger,\ndesiring to illustrate the flaws of *rites* as a teaching.\nHence, the *Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"Ru wine is thin, yet Deng You surrounds himself with walls\"*—\nthis is the very situation.\n\n**Thirdly, it clarifies the decline from the root—**\nurging the return to the source and abandonment of superficiality.\nThus, when the *Dao* is lost, *virtue* emerges;\nwhen *virtue* is lost, *benevolence* remains;\nwhen *benevolence* is lost, *righteousness* stands;\nwhen *righteousness* is lost, *rites* are instituted.\n\n**Imperial Gloss:**\n*\"Losing the Dao\"*—\nmeaning losing *upper virtue*,\nfor *upper virtue* aligns with the *Dao*,\nhence *\"losing the Dao.\"*\n*Virtue*, *power*, *benevolence*, and *righteousness* are terms\nadapted to the varying simplicity or complexity of the times—\nthus it is said:\n*\"When the Dao declines, virtue appears;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence remains;\nwhen benevolence fades, righteousness is established;\nwhen righteousness perishes, rites are instituted—*\nthese are all measures suited to their respective times.\"*\n\nTherefore, when discussing *rites* in the age of simplicity and purity,\nthey are either reckless or contrary—\nand when *rites* are forgotten in the age of corruption and excess,\nit is either foolishness or deceit.\nIf one can reform and return to the root,\nthen they should retreat from *rites* and practice *righteousness*,\nretreat from *righteousness* and practice *benevolence*,\nretreat from *benevolence* and practice *virtue*,\nforget *virtue* and return to the *Dao*,\nso that people revert to simplicity and purity—\nthen *upper virtue* attains *\"nothing to

*tranquility*,\nthey *ultimately* converge upon noble lords *guarding* *femininity* and *stillness*.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis**:\n*Ruination* means *overthrow*.\nIt says that noble lords, when they attain the *Dao*’s *use*,\nand become *lords* of the *world*,\nmust *forget* their *honor* and *glory*,\nand *humble* themselves to *nurture* [the people].\nIf they *fixate* on their *nobility* and *exaltation*,\nthey would fear *overthrow* and *ruin*,\nand *not* be able to *stabilize* the *world*.\n\nThe *Annotation* says:\nThe *Sacred Teachings* descend to the world,\noriginally for the sake of *living beings*—\nas the *Book of Documents* says:\n*“Heaven generates all things, but only humans are sentient.”*\nThe *First Sovereign* acts as *parent*—\nthus it is known that the *Sacred Teachings* belong to *one* person.\nThough they begin by *admonishing Heaven* and *Earth*\nto *forget* their *clarity* and *tranquility*,\nthey ultimately *admonish* noble lords\nto *not* *fixate* on their *transformative* and *nurturing* *virtue*.\n\nThe *use* of the *Dao* of *humility* is fully elaborated below.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:\nNoble lords must *bend* themselves and *submit* to others,\n*earnestly* seeking the *virtuous*—\nthey must *not* *only* desire to *exalt* themselves above others,\nor they would fear *overthrow* and *losing* their *position*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:\n*Ruination* means *defeat*.\nIf rulers cannot *use* the *Dao* to *guard* their *nobility*,\nand *deviate* from *principle* and *contradict* *virtue*,\nthey would fear the *Sacred Vessel* being *overthrown*,\nand the *altars* *tilting* in *danger*—\n*Xià Jié* and *Yīn Zhòu* were such men.\n\n**Thirdly**, it clarifies the *use* of the *Dao* in *humility*,\nconcluding the meaning of *attaining Oneness*.\n\nThus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*,\nand *height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*.\n\n○ **Imperial Annotation**:\nNoble lords are *noble* and *exalted*,\nwhile the *common folk* are *lowly* and *humble*—\nfor those who *govern*, the *people* are the *root* and *foundation*.\nThey must *toil* in *humility* to *gather* the people,\nso that they *rejoice* in the *harmonious* and *easy* *transformations*,\nand *not* *dispersion*.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis**:\n*Nobility* refers to noble lords,\n*lowliness* to the *common folk*—\nit says that noble lords *obtain* their *nobility* *through* the *common folk*,\nthus knowing that *lowliness* is the *root* and *foundation* of *nobility*.\n\nAs the *Book of Documents* says:\n*“The people are the *root* of the state;\nthe *root* firm, the state is *tranquil*.”*\nThe *Annotation* says:\n*“So they *rejoice* in the *harmonious* and *easy* *transformations*”*—\nas the *Book of Odes* says:\n*“The *harmonious* and *easy* noble one,\nis the *parent* of the people.”*\n*Harmonious* means *joyful*,\n*easy* means *gentle*.\nIt says that the noble one has *joyful* and *gentle* *virtues*,\n*nurturing* the people,\nso the common folk *think* of them\nas children think of their *parents*.\nIf their *virtues* are *opposite* to this,\nthen the people would *scatter*.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:\nThus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*—\nit says that those who *must* be *exalted* and *noble*\nshould take *humble* and *lowly* things as their *root*—\nlike *Yǔ* and *Shī* *personally* *plowing*,\n*Shùn* *molding* by the *riverbank*,\nand the *Duke of Zhōu* *dwelling* in *white-walled* huts.\n\n*Height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*—\nit says that those who *must* be *exalted*\nshould take *humility* as their *foundation*—\nlike *building walls* and *constructing* *works*,\n*elevating* from *lowliness*—\nif the *foundation* is *not* *firm*,\nthen *ruin* will *inevitably* come.\n\n○ **Master Róng** says:\nThus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*—\nthis means the *state* takes the *people* as its *root*,\nalso saying that *nobility* comes from *lowliness*.\n*Height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*—\neven the *nine-tiered* *palace*\nbegins with *accumulated* *earth*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:\nThus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*—\n*nobility* means *exalted* and *high*,\n*lowliness* means *humble* and *low*.\nThe ruler who attains *Oneness*\nthus is able to *humble* himself.\nThe ruler who *loses* the *Dao*\nmust *necessarily* become *proud* and *arrogant*—\nthus it is known that *arrogance* is the *foundation* of *lowliness*,\nand *humility* is the *root* of *nobility*.\n*Measuring* *gain* and *loss*,\ntherefore, such *admonitions* exist.\n\n*Height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*—\neven the *hundred-zhang* *height*\noriginates from a *single basket* of earth—\nto illustrate that *nobility* and *lowliness*\ntake *humility* as their *foundation*.\n\nTherefore, noble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—\nis this not taking *lowliness* as their *root*?\nIs it not?\n\n○ **Imperial Annotation**:\n*“Lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—\nthese are what *common* people *despise*,\nyet noble lords *use* them as their *titles*—\nclearly, they *humble* themselves to *nurture* [the people],\nand *do not* *fixate* on their *exaltation*.\n\n*Is it not?*—\na *rhetorical* question,\nto which the answer is: *“Indeed, it is taking lowliness as the root.”*\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis**:\n*Therefore*—\nconcluding the *previous* meaning.\nNoble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—\nas the *Zuǒ Zhuan* records:\n*“I, the lonely one, with my few ministers, grieve over lost plans.”*\nThose who *call* themselves *“the widowed”* follow the *example*\nwhere the *former sovereign* praised *“the widowed”* as *virtuous*.\nThose who *call* themselves *“not-grain”* follow the *example*\nwhere *“not-grain”* *hated* his *lack* of *sincere virtue*.\n\nAgain, according to *rites*,\na *son* does *not* call his *father* *“lonely”*,\na *wife* does *not* call her *husband* *“widowed”*,\nand *“grain”* means *“to open”*—\n*“not-grain”* is like *“not-good.”*\nAll these *three names*,\nthough *despised* by people,\nare *used* by noble lords as their *titles*—\nclearly, they *humble* themselves to *nurture* [the people],\nand *do not* *fixate* on their *exaltation*.\n\n*Is this not taking lowliness as their root?*\nIt says: *“If it is not like this, then what is?”*\n*Is it not?*—\na *rhetorical* exclamation,\nto which the answer is: *“Indeed, it is taking lowliness as the root.”*\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:\nTherefore, noble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—\n*“lonely”* and *“widowed”* *illustrate* *isolation*,\n*“not-grain”* *illustrates* *inability*—\nlike the *hub* of a *cartwheel*,\n*supported* by all the *spokes*.\n\n*Is this not taking lowliness as their root?*\nNoble lords, though *most exalted*,\nare able to *call* themselves *“lonely”* and *“widowed”*—\nis this *not* taking *lowliness* as their *root*?\n*—to enlighten the people.*\n\n*Is it not?*\n—a *sigh* of *exclamation*.\n\n○ **Master Róng** says:\nTherefore, noble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—\n*“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”* are the *humble* *titles* of kings and lords—\nthis is also *not forgetting* their *root*.\n\n「Is this truly taking *lowliness* as their *root*?\nNo—it is not that they *actually* take *lowliness* as their *root*.\n○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:\n*\"Not-grain\"* arises from *unvirtue*.\n○ Noble lords and highborn, wise and perceptive, yet indulging in arrogance and self-indulgence—this is the *root* of their ruin. *Humility* is the foundation of true nobility, so they must stoop to embrace the lowly, governing themselves with *lowliness*—thus calling themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain.”*\nIs this not taking *lowliness* as their *root*?\nYet they say *“Is it not?”*—this is merely an exclamatory rhetorical question, as if to affirm: *“Indeed, it is taking lowliness as their root.”*\n\nThus, *“count the carriages, yet there are no carriages.”*\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*“Count the carriages”* and there are *“no carriages.”*\nThe *hub* and *axle* are the *root* of the carriage—\ncounting *nobility* reveals *no nobility*;\n*lowliness* beneath is the *root* of *nobility*.\nThe *axle* is the *root* of the carriage—\nif one *fixates* on it, the carriage is *established*;\n*lowliness* is the *root* of *nobility*—\nif one *guards* it, *nobility* is *secure*.\nThis admonishes noble lords:\nto take *lowliness* as their *root*—\nmerely a metaphor for *“counting carriages”* without *carriages*.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*“Thus”* continues the preceding thought.\nEarlier, it was explained that noble lords *gain nobility through lowliness*—\n*nobility* has no fixed form,\nits principle is difficult to clarify,\nso it borrows *“counting carriages”* as an analogy.\nExhausting the *count* of carriages,\nultimately there is *no name* for *“carriage,”*\nyet the *wheel* and *axle* are *falsely* called *“carriage.”*\nThis metaphorizes noble lords:\ncounting their *nobility* reveals *no name* for *“noble,”*\nyet *lowliness* beneath is *falsely* borrowed as the *root* of their *nobility*.\nThe *wheel* and *axle* are the *root* of the carriage—\nif the *root* is *preserved*, there is a carriage;\nif the *root* is *lost*, there is no carriage.\n*Lowliness* beneath is the *root* of *nobility*—\nif the *root* is *preserved*, there is *position*;\nif the *root* is *abandoned*, there is no *position*.\nThis is said to admonish noble lords:\nto cherish and nourish the lowly,\nnot to abandon the solitary and bereaved.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng’s Explanation**:\n*“Thus”* means *“to approach.”*\nPeople approach the *counted carriages*—\nas *spokes*, as *wheels*, as *hubs*, as *poles*, as *carriages*—\nyet there is *no name* for *“carriage”* itself,\nso it *becomes* a carriage.\nThis illustrates that noble lords,\nnot clinging to *exalted titles*,\nare thus *established* in their *nobility*.\n\n○ **Master Róng says**:\nNoble lords are truly *noble* yet *name* themselves *lowly*—\nthese are *Dao*-realized rulers.\nSongs and ballads *praise virtue* yet do not *glorify* them,\nfor this is *“counting praise” yet there is *no praise*—\n*slander* hangs like a *suspended* *jewel*, yet it is not *blame*,\nfor this is *“counting blame” yet there is *no blame*.\nThe *Dao*-embodied gentleman\nremains unmoved by external *honor* or *humiliation*,\n*gain* or *loss*—\nhis *joy* and *anger* do not show on his *countenance*.\n\n○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:\n*“Carriage”* means *“chariot.”*\n*Spokes*, *hubs*, *rims*—\n*falsely* assembled, yet *only* the *name* of *“chariot”* remains.\nCount them, and there is *no substance*—\nthe *Five Aggregates*, the *Four Great Elements*—\nall are *illusion*.\nThus, the *body* being *empty* and *void*,\nwhere shall *nobility* be *lodged*?\nTherefore, in *nobility*, one must *practice humility*.\nOne should not be *polished* like *jade*,\nnor *rough* like *stone*.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*“Polished”* (*liángliáng*)—the *appearance* of *jade*;\n*“rough”* (*luòluò*)—the *appearance* of *stone*.\nTo take *lowliness* as the *root*.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*Jade* is *noble*, *stone* is *lowly*—\nlike *jade*, one *exalts* oneself;\nlike *stone*, one *humbles* oneself.\nSince noble lords take *lowliness* as their *root*,\nthey must not be *polished* like *jade* in *self-exaltation*,\nbut rather *rough* like *stone* to *guard humility*.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says**:\n*“Polished”* (*liángliáng*) means *“few”* (in virtue);\n*“rough”* (*luòluò*) means *“many”* (in flaws).\n*Jade* is *few* in *flaws*, hence *blamed* for being *precious*;\n*stone* is *many* in *flaws*, hence *despised* for being *lowly*.\nThis says: *“Do not wish to be like jade, prized by others,\nnor like stone, scorned by others—\nbut dwell in the *middle*.”*\n\n○ **Master Yán says**:\nNeither *few* nor *many*,\nneither *noble* nor *lowly*—\nwithout *acting* from the *body*,\nthe *Spirit* and *Clarity* are *unbound*;\nwithout *acting* from *Heaven*,\none *aligns* with the *ten thousand things*.\n\n○ **Master Róng says**:\n*Jade*, *polished* and *few*, is thus *noble*;\n*stone*, *rough* and *many*, is thus *lowly*.\n*Lowliness* is what people *hate*,\n*nobility* is what *things* *attack*—\nboth are *unstable*.\nIn *nobility*, yet *humble and retiring*,\none does not wish to be like *jade* under *attack*.\nIn *lowliness*, yet *aspiring to equality*,\none does not wish to be like *stone* and *abandoned*.\nObtain it with *oneness*,\ndwell in it with *moderation*—\nonly the *highest* and the *lowest*\nare *unstable*;\nall else is *secure*.\n\n○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:\n*Jade*—*nobility*.\n*Stone*—*lowliness*.\n*Polished*—*few*.\n*Rough*—*many*.\nIf one is *internally confused* by the *body*,\n*externally misled* by *things*,\nthen one *values* *lowliness* while *degrading* the *body*.\nNow, having *“counted carriages” yet found no carriage**,\none *awakens* to the *emptiness* of *self* and *things*,\nthus *transforming* into *equality*—\n*nobility* and *lowliness* are *indistinguishable*,\n*separating* from *form*, *abandoning* *knowledge*,\n*merging* into the *Ultimate Dao*—\nthus, one does not wish to be *polished* like *jade* (as *precious*),\nnor *rough* like *stone* (as *despised*).\n\n---\n**“The Chapter of *Reversal*: The Movement of the Dao”**\nThis chapter follows the previous,\nproperly illuminating those who *obtain Oneness*—\n*humble* and *vacant*, *using* the *Dao*,\nthus it is placed here,\nclarifying how such a person,\n*descending* from the *root* and *following* the *path*,\n*stoops* to respond to the *people*.\n\nThis chapter opens into three distinctions.\n**First**, it clarifies *compassionate* *salvation* of *things*,\n*reversing* the *Sage* to *align* with the *common*.\n**Second**, though *teaching* appears in *many forms*,\nnone surpass *gentleness* and *weakness*.\n**Third**, the *Two Forces* and *ten thousand phenomena*\narise from the *Dao*.\n\n**First**, it clarifies *compassionate* *salvation* of *things*,\n*reversing* the *Sage* to *align* with the *common*.\nSilent and *unmoving*,\never *congealed* within the *Great Red*,\n*Mysterious* yet *nameless*,\n*Returning* to *begin* above the *Primordial Blue*.\n*Uniting* the *One Qi* of *Origin*,\n*Deploying* the *functions* of the *Three Powers*,\n*Distinguishing* the *hard* and *soft* of *Heaven* and *Earth*,\n*Operating* the *nurturing* of *Yin* and *Yang*.\nMaking the *Dragon’s head* into *virtue*,\n*Alone* bearing *Pei Qiáng*,\nthe *Tiger* and *Rhinoceros* as *awe*,\n*Following* *Dòng Fèng*’s *command*.\n*Heaven’s* *writings* *shimmer*—\nthe *seventy-two* *characters* of *text*,\n*Cloud-scripts* *radiant*—\nthe *eighty-one* *sections* of *mystery*.\n*Emperor Yú* of *Xià* *revered* it, his *blessing* *distant*;\n*Yǒu Lǘ* *stole* it, his *nation* *perished*.\nAt the *Jade Pool*, the *Minghu* *feasted*—\nthe *Han River* questioned *King Zhāo*, who *never returned*.\nThus it is known:\nthe *essence* of *obtaining the Dao*—\n*spirits* and *numina* thereby *bless* people;\nthe *calamity* of *losing the Dao*—\n*portents* and *omens* thereby *destroy* and *extinguish*.\n\n*“Reversal”* means *movement*—\ntruly as it is said:\n*Silent*, the *mystery* is *serene*;\n*responding*, it *interacts* with the *common* for *use*.\nThe *Ultimate Dao* *reverses* and *lends*—\nthis is indeed *truthful speech*.\n\n**“The Movement of the Dao”**\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\nThis clarifies *adaptation*—\n*“Reversal”* takes *contrary* *principles* to *harmonize* *meaning*.\n\n**“The Movement of the Dao” (Continued)**\n\n**“Reversal of Principle, Unity of Meaning”**\nThis is how the Sage acts with *adaptation*—\n*Adaptation* is the *Dao’s* movement,\nhence it is said: *“Reversal”* is the *Dao’s* movement.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThis clarifies *adaptation*—\n*“Reversal”* takes *contrary* *principles* to *harmonize* *meaning*.\n**Imperial Citation:**\n*“Reversal”* is *adaptation* to *common* *usage* for *meaning*,\n*“Movement”* is the name for *change*—\nspeaking of *adaptation* to the *Dao*.\nIt is said that *sentient beings* cling to *life* and thereby *lose* the *Dao*,\nso the Sage *varies* and *adapts*, ordering *things* to *reverse* *common* *ways* and *align* with the *Dao*.\n\nThe *Commentary* says: *“Reversal of Principle, Unity of Meaning”*—\n*“Principle”* means *constancy*,\n*“Meaning”* means *appropriateness*.\nTo make the *noble* take the *lowly* as *foundation*,\nthe *high* take the *low* as *base*,\nthe *having* take the *non-being* for *use*—\nfirst, it *contradicts* *common* *sentiment*,\nthen it *conforms* and *unites* with the *Dao*,\nhence it is called the *Dao’s* movement.\n\nConfucius said:\n*“One may stand with him, but one cannot yet adapt with him.”*\nSince *adaptation* to the *Dao* *contradicts* *constancy* and is difficult to grasp,\nhe used the analogy of the *mulberry tree*:\n*“Its flowers reverse before they unite,”*\nto illustrate that *adaptation* first *inverts* before it *conforms*.\n\n**Master Hé Shàng** said:\n*“Reversal”* means *returning* to the *root*—\nthe *Dao* moves to *generate* all *things*,\nand *abandoning* it leads to *ruin*.\n\n**Master Róng** said:\n*“Reversal”* is the *Dao’s* movement,\n*“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.\nThe *Dao* employs *gentleness* and *weakness* for *use*—\nall *movement* *reverses* *common* *ways*,\nfor *common* *ways* rely on *rigidity* and *strength*,\nand all *things* thereby *lose* the *Dao*.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*“Reversal”* means *returning*.\n*“Movement”* means *compassion*.\nThe *Sage* who *obtains* the *Dao* transcends the *Three Realms*,\nyet with *compassion* and *pity* he *enters* the *Three Realms*,\nmingling among *existence* and *responding* to *circumstances*—\nhence the *Classic* says: *“Returning to the Sun.”*\nThe second section clarifies that though *teaching* may *vary* in *methods*,\nnothing surpasses *gentleness* and *weakness*.\n*“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nThis clarifies *substance*—\n*“Weakness”* takes *gentleness*, *femininity*, and *tranquility*,\nfor *gentleness*, *femininity*, and *tranquility* are the *Sage’s* *substance*.\nTo *dwell* in *substance* is the *Dao’s* *constant* *use,\nhence it is said: *“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.\n\n**Imperial Citation:**\nThis clarifies the *substance* of the *Dao*—\npeople all *degrade* the *weak* and *exalt* the *strong*,\nthus knowing that the *forceful*, *arrogant*, and *boisterous* are the *common* *ways*.\nThe *Dao* overcomes the *rigid* with *harmony* and *gentleness*,\nthus knowing that *gentleness*, *weakness*, *femininity*, and *tranquility*\nare the *Dao’s* *constant* *use,\nhence it is said: *“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.\n\n**Master Hé Shàng** said:\n*“Gentleness* and *weakness* are what the *Dao* *constantly* *uses*,\nand thus it endures.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*Responding* to *circumstances* and *setting* *teachings*,\nthough *methods* may *vary*,\nto discuss *appropriately*, nothing surpasses *gentleness* and *weakness*,\nhence *gentleness* and *weakness* are taken as the *primary* *means* of *transformation*.\n\nThe third section clarifies the *Two Principles* and *ten thousand phenomena*,\nwhich arise from the *Dao*.\nAll *things* under *heaven* are *born* from *being*,\nand *being* is *born* from *non-being*.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nAs *substance* relates to *adaptation*,\nso *non-being* *generates* *being*—\nthus, those who *act* with *adaptation* *revere* *returning* to *substance*,\nand those who *use* *being* must *depend* on *non-being*.\nYet the *Ultimate Dao* is *empty* and *serene*,\n*separate* from *names* and *forms*,\nall *dharma-nature* is *void*,\nand *things* do not *depend* on each other.\nIf one can *forget* both *adaptation* and *substance*,\nand *obliterate* both *being* and *non-being*,\nthen one attains *counting* without *counting*,\nand may be said to *transcend*.\n\n**Imperial Citation:**\nIt is said that all *things* under *heaven* with *form*\nmust *transmit* through *form*—\nhence it is said: *“born from being.”*\nExhausting their *substantial* *bodies*,\nthey must *depend* on *non-being*—\nhence *Listed Child* said:\n*“Form moves yet cannot generate form, only shadow;\nnon-being moves yet cannot generate non-being, only being.”*\nThus it is said: *“The *void* is the *root* of *heaven* and *earth*,\n*non-being* is the *source* of *ten thousand things.”*\nThis is spoken to make *sentient beings* *exhaust* the *source* and *recognize* the *root* to *awaken* to the *Dao*.\n\nSince *being* and *non-being* are thus,\nso too are *adaptation* and *substance*—\nhence the *Commentary* says:\n*“Substance* relates to *adaptation* as *non-being* *generates* *being.”*\nAgain, it says:\n*“The *Ultimate Dao* is *empty* and *serene*,\n*separate* from *names* and *forms*,\nall *dharma-nature* is *void*,\nand *things* do not *depend* on each other.”*\nThis means the *Dao* at its *extreme* is *empty* and *serene*,\nneither *adaptation* nor *substance*—\nhow can it be *named*?\nThe *true nature* of all *dharma* in *principle*\nis neither *being* nor *non-being*,\n*cutting off* all *dependence*—\nwhat is said of *“things born from being, being born from non-being”*\nare all *approximations* by *analogy*.\nIf one knows *“counting without counting”*,\nthen one knows *“counting all *dharma* without *dharma*”**—\nhow could there be *being*, *non-being*, *adaptation*, or *substance*\nthat can be said to *generate* each other?\nThose who *awaken* to this *principle* may be said to have *fully understood*.\n\n**Master Hé Shàng** said:\nAll *things* under *heaven* are *born* from *being*—\nall *things* under *heaven* arise from *heaven* and *earth*,\nand *heaven* and *earth* have *form* and *position*,\nhence it is said: *“born from being.”*\n*“Being* is *born* from *non-being*”—\n*heaven* and *earth* in their *divine* *clarity*,\n*fluttering* and *creeping* *things*,\nall arise from the *Dao*—\nthe *Dao* has no *form* or *image*,\nhence it is said: *“born from non-being.”*\nThis speaks of *root* overcoming *flower*,\n*weakness* overcoming *strength*,\nand *humility* overcoming *fullness*.\n\n**Master Róng** said:\n*“Being”* refers to *heaven* and *earth*—\n*heaven* and *earth* have *form*,\nhence they are called *being*.\n*Heaven* covers, *earth* bears,\nand *things* thereby *obtain* *life*—\nhence it is said: *“born from being.”*\n*“Non-being”* refers to the *Dao*—\nthe *Dao* has no *form* or *appearance*,\nits *nature* is *pure* and *empty*,\nhence it is said: *“non-being.”*\n*Heaven* and *earth* arise from the *Dao*,\nand *being* is *born* from *non-being*—\nhence it is said: *“The *void* is the *root* of *heaven* and *earth*,\n*non-being* is the *source* of *ten thousand things.”*\nThe *bewildered* *lose* the *Dao* and do not *recognize* the *origin*—\nthe *Sage* *transmits* *teaching* to clarify the *beginning*.\nIf one can *return* to the *Dao*,\ntranscend *birth* and *death*, and *exit* *being* and *non-being*,\nthen one is *deluded* and *common*,\n*entangled* in *being* and *non-being* and *bound* to *birth* and *death*.\n*Form* and *spirit* *unite* and *appear* in *form*—\nhence it is said: *“born from being.”*\n*Form* and *spirit* *disperse* and have no *substance*—\nhence it is said: *“born from non-being.”*\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*“Being”* responds to the *Dao*—\nthis is called the *original* *qi* of *Oneness*.\n*“Non-being”* is the *mysterious* *root*—\nthis is called the *dark* and *silent* *foundation*.\nIt is said that *heaven*, *earth*, and *ten thousand things*\nall arise from the *Dao’s* *response* with *law*—\nthis *response* to the *Dao* arises from the *mysterious* *root*.\n*Original* to the *mysterious* *root* is *ultimate* *non-being*.\nFrom the *Classic of the Way and Its Virtue*, *Volume Eleven*, *Commentary by Mù on the Profound Virtue*, ends.\n\n「#3

and Its Virtue: *Profound Virtue* Compilation and Commentary, Volume Twelve**\n*Commentary and Glosses by Emperor Xuánzōng of the Tang Dynasty*\n*Glosses by Shānshàng Gōng, Yán Jūnping, and Lǐ Róng*\n*Commentary by Master Chéng Xuányīng*\n*Compiled by Qiáng Sīzǐ of Mèngyáng*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**\n\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous one is that the prior chapter elucidates the *Dao’s* *response* with *law*—both its *trace* and *substance* are wondrous—so this chapter clarifies that the *superior person* can awaken to it, whereas the *inferior* cannot.\n\nNow, examining this chapter, its meaning unfolds in three distinctions:\n1. The three kinds of people who hear the Dao possess differing *natures* and *capacities*.\n2. Those who embody the Dao conceal their light and obscure their brilliance.\n3. The Dao’s transformative *power* gives rise to all myriad things.\n\n**1. The three kinds of people who hear the Dao possess differing *natures* and *capacities*.**\n\nThe Dao is set forth in three categories, and people perceive it in myriad ways—\nsome soar upon the *path* of heaven, their flight surpassing the clouds of the *Great Peng* (鹏),\nwhile others are confined to earthly *traces*, buried for a century beneath the mounds of ants.\nThe *foolish* adjust to the lowly, while the *virtuous* rise with lofty *qi*—\nthus, by the seaside there are those who chase after stench,\nand in the imperial halls, those who cherish fragrance.\n\nThe *superior sage* diligently practices the Dao,\nwhile the *lowly* clap their hands and mock it—\nlost in the *clear spring*, they forever wallow in *muddy waters*.\nAh! When the winds and rains darken the sky,\nwhy does the *phoenix* not stir? Since they do not awaken,\nhow can the *rat* know what is *ugly*?\nThe distinctions among these three ranks lie here.\n\nThe *superior person* hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\n*Awakened understanding leads to diligent practice.*\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nThe *superior sage* possesses deep insight and piercing discernment.\nHearing the Dao, they grasp its provisional clarity,\nyet its true essence is soft and yielding.\nThus, upon hearing it, they act without pause—\nhence it is said: *“stirring and practicing.”*\n\n**Shānshàng Gōng says:**\nThe *superior person*, upon hearing the Dao,\nstrives with utmost effort to embody it.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nTheir faith in the Dao grows ever stronger,\nand they practice with resolute will—\nunmoved by the shifts of cold and heat,\nunshaken even as gold and stone dissolve,\ntheir beginning and end remain constant,\nfirm and unyielding—\nthis is what is meant by *“stirring and practicing.”*\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe *superior* in *capacity* possesses keen wisdom and insight,\nyet upon hearing the *Dao’s* ultimate truth,\nthey awaken to the emptiness of all phenomena—\nthus, they exert themselves in study,\nnever ceasing in their diligence.\n\nThe *middle person* hears the Dao—\nsometimes it seems to exist, sometimes not.\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\n*The middle person* can ascend or descend,\nhence their doubt.\n\nDoubt makes it seem as if it exists or does not.\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nThe *moderate* in understanding\nhave not yet clarified the distinction between clarity and obscurity.\nHearing the Dao’s wondrous *Way*,\nthey sometimes believe, sometimes disbelieve—\nif they grasp its clarity, they hold fast in faith,\nbut if they fail to see its depth, they doubt and waver,\nnot yet firmly resolved—\nhence it is said: *“sometimes it exists, sometimes not.”*\n\n**Shānshàng Gōng says:**\nThe *middle person*, upon hearing the Dao,\npursue bodily preservation to extend their life,\nand govern their state to achieve great peace—\nthey rejoice in its existence,\nyet when confronted with wealth, desire, or honor,\nthey may succumb to emotion and lose sight of it.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nLike raw silk, they lack constancy,\nchasing after the fleeting hues of *Dao* and *non-Dao*—\nthe *middle person* is undecided,\ntheir heart shifting with their likes and dislikes.\nHearing the *true Dao*,\nthey preserve their life to stabilize their nation—\nthen they uphold the Dao and abandon the mundane.\nSeeing wealth and desire,\nthey delight in sensory gratification—\nthen they cling to the mundane and forget the Dao.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe *middle* in *capacity* have a balanced intellect,\nyet their understanding of principle remains unclear.\nThough they hear the Dao,\nthey cannot fathom its profundity—\nif they restrain their emotions and return to the *Way*,\nthey attain emptiness in that moment,\nyet their mind, once touched by worldly dust,\nbecomes entangled in the realm of *being*—\ntheir resolve is uncertain,\nhence it is said: *“exists or does not.”*\n\nThe *inferior person* hears the Dao and laughs loudly at it.\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\n*They are lost and do not believe,*\nhence they mock it.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nThose of shallow insight do not grasp the Dao’s principle—\nhearing it, they dismiss it as empty fancy,\nand thus scoff at it.\nThis is like the *Zhuofu* (章甫) being deemed coarse by the *Yue* people,\nor the *Hepu* (和璞) being rejected by the *Chu* kingdom—\nhence *Zhuāngzi* says:\n*“A rigid thinker cannot be spoken to about the Dao.”*\n\n**Shānshàng Gōng says:**\nThe *inferior person* is greedy and lustful, craving many things—\nseeing the Dao’s softness and yielding,\nthey call it *frightening and cowardly*,\nand when they see its simplicity and plainness,\nthey deem it *vulgar and crude*—\nhence they laugh loudly at it.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nTheir mind is confused by gain and loss,\nthey know the near but not the far—\ntheir senses are dull to truth and falsehood,\ntheir understanding shallow, unable to perceive depth.\nThey only delight in the petty practices of worldly dust,\nand mock the vast *Dao* of *emptiness and clarity*.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe *inferior* in *capacity* are dull and obtuse—\nhearing the Dao’s profound and distant truths,\nits vast and sweeping words,\nthey fail to awaken to its meaning,\ndeeming it empty and fantastic,\nand thus slander it, clapping their hands in derision.\n\n**If they do not mock, it is not sufficient to be called the Dao.**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\n*If the Dao is not mocked by the inferior,*\nit is not profound and wondrous enough.*\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**\nThe Dao is *profound and mysterious*—\ndeep beyond comprehension,\nbright yet veiled,\nits principles contrary to ordinary perception—\nthus, it is mocked.\nIf the inferior do not mock it,\nit lacks subtlety and refinement—\nit is merely a shallow, conventional teaching,\nnot worthy of being called the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is not a teaching for the *common* age—\nthus, it is mocked by the *lowly and foolish*,\nand this is why it is called the *wondrous Dao*.\n\n**Shānshàng Gōng says:**\n*If the inferior do not mock it,*\nit is not sufficient to be called the Dao.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nThe Dao is deep and intricate,\ndifficult for the inferior to grasp—\nits subtlety and mystery\nare not easily recognized by the *lowly and foolish*.\nNow, if they mock it,\nit cannot make the *true* blend with the *muddy*—\nrather, it serves to highlight the Dao’s purity and distance.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*If the inferior do not mock it,*\nit is not worthy to be called the *sage’s Dao*.\n**Establishing the true *substance* of the Dao:**\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\n*Establishing* means *setting forth*.\n\nNow, setting forth this teaching,\nto clarify the differing *paths* of the *superior person*,\nthe *middle person*, and the *inferior person* toward the Dao.\n\nThe *substance* here refers to\nthe subsequent elucidation of the Dao and other matters.»\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\n*\"Establishing\"* means *\"setting forth.\"* When the Dao is set forth in speech, it is as in the following passage.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nHuman inclinations vary—\nthe Sage establishes methods to harmonize divergent hearts.\nWithout teaching, there is no failing to teach;\nyet common sentiments of approval or rejection\nmay lead to disbelief.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Establishing\"* means *\"setting forth\"*—\nthe Dao practiced by the *superior person* is elucidated below.\n*\"The substance\"* refers to the subsequent passages on the Dao and other matters.\n\n---\n**Second, elucidating those who embody the Dao in concealment:**\n\n**The Dao appears as if obscured,**\n**Advancing the Dao seems like retreat,**\n**The Way of the plain seems like the flawed.**\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\n*\"The Dao appears as if obscured\"*—\nthe *superior person* acts, yet in clarity, it seems obscured;\nin advancement, it seems retreat;\nin the plain, it seems flawed.\nThus, the *middle person* doubts it,\nwhile the *inferior* laughs greatly.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\n*\"Clarity\"* means illumination.\n*\"Obscured\"* means dimness.\nIt speaks of those who cultivate virtue—\nnurturing obscurity to achieve clarity,\nabandoning form and discarding wisdom,\nyet truly illuminated—\nhence, *\"as if obscured.\"*\nThe *superior person*, though diligent in practice,\nappears in clarity as if obscured—\nthe *inferior*, not comprehending, thus mocks it.\nThe *middle person*, initially hearing of the illuminated Dao,\nseems to retain it,\nbut later, as if forgotten, seems obscured.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThose who illuminate the Dao\nappear as if dark and seeing nothing.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nWisdom is all-encompassing—*clarity*.\nShining without dazzling—*obscured*.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Obscured\"* means dim.\nThose who truly perceive the Dao\nconceal their brilliance, blending with the common,\nnot displaying their clarity,\nas if foolish and aligned.\n\n**Advancing the Dao seems like retreat,**\n**The Way of the plain seems like the flawed.**\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThose advancing the Dao\nhave no inner ambition,\nforget external affairs,\ndaily diminishing fame,\nyet great achievement seems lacking—\nthe *inferior*, observing this, deem it retreat and failure.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThose who advance the Dao\nappear as if lagging behind.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nHearing the Dao and diligently practicing—*advancement*.\nGreat achievement seeming incomplete—*retreat*.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe *greatly learned* show no progress—\nthough internally advancing,\nexternally they seem to retreat.\n\n**The Way of the plain seems like the flawed,**\n**The Dao of equality seems like the uneven.**\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\n*\"Plain\"* means level.\n*\"Flawed\"* refers to uneven silk.\nThe mind, pure and free of dust,\nuntainted by desire,\nlevel and unobstructed,\nyet externally like uneven silk.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\n*\"Plain\"* means level—\nthose of the Great Dao\ndo not distinguish themselves,\nappearing like many flawed comparisons.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nLevel and equal—*the plain Dao*—\nharmonizing light with dust,\nas if flawed.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Plain\"* means level—\nattaining the Dao of perfect equality,\nthose who practice know\nall beings share the same substance,\nseeing no distinction between wise and foolish,\nequal in rank and kind.\nThis meaning—interpreted by Hé, Chéng, and Lǐ—\nis the explanation for *\"flawed.\"*\n\n---\n**The virtue of the highest is like a valley,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nEmpty and green, containing all things.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThose who diligently practice are called *highest virtue*—\ntheir virtue, fully manifest,\ncontains all without exclusion—\nhence, *\"like a valley.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThose of highest virtue are like deep valleys,\nunashamed by filth and turbidity.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nNothing is excluded.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThose surpassing in virtue\nequal the boundless void,\nthus able to contain all things—\nlike an empty valley.\n*\"Common\"* also written as *\"society\"*—\nspeaking of those who can even forget virtue,\nnot differing from the vulgar.\n\n---\n**Great purity seems like disgrace,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nPure yet containing filth.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\n*\"Pure\"* means pristine.\n*\"Disgrace\"* means dust.\nThose attaining pristine purity\nconceal their traces, blending with dust—\nthus called *\"as if disgrace,\"*\nyet truly pure and complete.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThose of great purity\nappear as if stained with disgrace,\nnot self-displaying.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nCoarse yet not impure—*great purity*.\nMixed yet seeming turbid—*as if disgrace.*\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Pure\"* means pristine and tranquil.\n*\"Disgrace\"* means defiled.\nThose of great purity and high conduct\nharmonize their light with dust,\ndo not dazzle others,\nthus blend into the waves—\nas if stained with disgrace.\nHence, the Eastern Master said:\n*\"Purify the Dao yet soil its traces\"*—\nthis is the meaning.\n\n---\n**Great virtue seems insufficient,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nGreat achievement yet holding humility.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThose of ultimate virtue—\ntheir virtue pervades all—*great*.\nGuarding softness and practicing humility,\nthus always appearing insufficient.\n*The Records of the Historian* says:\n*\"A skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty;\nthe virtuous man, though full of virtue,\nappears as if foolish.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThose of broad virtue\nappear as if foolish and insufficient.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nGreat fullness seems empty.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Great\"* means vast.\nThose bearing great virtue,\nembodying the Dao in emptiness and forgetfulness,\nthus internally wise yet externally appearing insufficient.\n*The Laozi Transmission* says:\n*\"A skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty;\nthe virtuous man, though full of virtue,\nappears as if foolish.\"*\n\n---\n**Establishing virtue seems like theft,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nAccomplishing deeds without ostentation.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\n*\"Establishing\"* means *\"setting forth.\"*\n*\"Theft\"* means stealth.\nThose establishing hidden virtue\npractice secretly,\nlike thieves who always fear discovery—\nthus, *\"as if theft.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThose establishing morality\nappear as if deceitfully emptied.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nSecret practice, covert influence.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Theft\"* means stealth.\nThose establishing great virtue\nhide their names, conceal their traces,\nlike thieves acting unseen—\nhence, the Classic says:\n*\"As if fearing their neighbors.\"*\n\n---\n**True purity seems like theft,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nSincere and harmonizing light.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\n*\"True\"* means pure and unadulterated.\n*\"Theft\"* means transformation.\nThose practicing the Dao—\ntheir virtue pure and unadulterated,\nyet seemingly transformable,\nblending with others while harmonizing their light.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThe unadorned and simple—\nif their colors seem to shift,\nthey are shallow and indistinct.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\n*\"Shift\"* means transformation.\nNature untainted, substance ever-present—\nthis is true purity.\nForgotten life and death,\nunited with transformation—\nthis is *\"shift.\"*\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Substance\"* means reality.\n*\"Shift\"* means transformation.\nThose of innate truth and substance—\nstill yet moving, true yet responsive,\ntheir transformations reveal impermanence—\nthus, they seem to *\"shift.\"*\n\n**The Great Square has no corners,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nIt does not erect rigid boundaries.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\n*\"Square\"* means upright.\n*\"Corners\"* means angles.\nTo polish one’s name and principles\nto erect rigid boundaries—\nthese are the Eastern Teachings’ adherents,\nnot the true Great Square.\nGround smooth yet unbroken,\ndwelling in mud without staining—\nthis is the Great Square.\nYet harmonizing light with dust,\nnot distinguishing itself—\nno corners.\nThus, *\"The Great Square has no corners.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThe truly upright and square\nhave no crookedness or sharp angles.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nThe cosmos manifests forms,\nit has squares.\nThe Supreme Dao is formless—\nno corners.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Corners\"* means angles.\nThose embodying the Dao’s vast wisdom and elegance—\nfollowing naturally, conforming to things,\nnot clinging to principles or erecting angles—\nthis is called *\"transcending principles.\"*\n\n**Great vessels take long to mature,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nAnd yield no immediate gains.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nVessels hold all things;\nbecause of their lateness, they achieve greatness.\nThus, the superior sage diligently practices,\naccumulating merit to attain realization—\ngradual, not achieved in a day.\nHence, *\"late maturity.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nGreat vessels—\nlike the Nine Tripods and jade ornaments—\ncannot be rushed to completion.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nHabits solidify over time,\nperfection lies in duration—\nthus, cultivation cannot be achieved in a single day.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe Nine Tripods and jade ornaments\nare not completed in a day—\na parable for the truly great:\nnot attained by hasty effort,\nrequiring eons of refinement\nto reach the utmost void—\nas with the Master of the Empty Boat fishing.\n\n**Great sound is rare in voice,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nIt does not adorn with frivolous words.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThe Dao responds to all sounds—\ngreat sound.\nListening, yet no voice—\nrare in voice.\nThus, the Sage expounds the One Vehicle:\nits law resounds widely,\nawaiting awakening to respond—\nhence, *\"rare in voice.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nGreat sound is like thunder—\nit moves when the time is right,\na metaphor for constant love of *qi* and rare speech.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nThe great bell tolls in rhythm,\nthe Mysterious Teaching acts according to circumstances.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Rare\"* means nonexistent.\nThe Supreme Dao’s great sound—\nsilent, yet without sound,\nfrom origin to manifestation—\nsoundless sound.\nThus, Zhong Ziqi heard nothing,\nyet the jade resonance shook the cosmos.\nTo clarify: it is both trace and origin—\nhence, *\"great sound is rare in voice.\"*\n\n**Great form is formless,**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nThus, it can respond to all kinds.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThose bound to form and substance\nare confined to one aspect.\nOnly the Dao of Great Form—\noriginally formless,\nresponding as it is sensed,\nshaping all forms—\nhence, *\"great form is formless.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThose embodying the Great Law’s form\nare simple, without embellishment.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nGreat form is formless,\nthe Dao is hidden, nameless.\nThe void encompasses all forms—\nthus, *\"great form,\"*\ngreat form without form—\nhence, *\"formless.\"*\nForm cannot be concealed—\nthus, *\"the Dao is hidden,\"*\ncut off from designation—\nhence, *\"nameless.\"*\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe Dao’s great form—\nform yet formless.\nFormless yet form—\nformless.\nEven Zhuli’s keen eyes could not perceive its form.\nIts colors fill the void—\nto clarify: it is both having and not having—\nhence, *\"great form is formless.\"*\n\n**The Dao is hidden, nameless.**\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nIts functions are not displayed.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nIf we call its pervasive generation *\"Dao,\"*\nforgetting its functions—\nthis is hidden, nameless.\nDesiring to name it to describe its substance,\nyet its mystery is formless—\nthus, it cannot be named—\nhence, *\"the Dao is hidden, nameless.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThe Dao is concealed,\nso no one can name it.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe Supreme Dao’s mystery—\nprofound, hidden, and obscure—\nbeyond form and substance’s measure,\nhow could names and speech define it?\n\n**A third sigh at the Dao’s creative power.**\nOnly the Dao\nis both generous and accomplished—\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nThough hidden and nameless,\nit truly generously endows all with harmonious, wondrous use\nand brings them to fulfillment.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThis concludes the Dao’s functions.\n*\"Ah!\"*—a sigh.\n*\"Only\"*—exclusive.\n\nThe lending is giving and bestowing.\nThis Dao, though nameless and formless,\nwithout shape or sound,\nalone spreads *qi* and transforms,\nlending and bestowing upon all things,\nbringing them to fulfillment—\nthus, *\"generous in lending and accomplished.\"*\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\n*\"Fulfillment\"* means completion.\nThe Dao generously lends its vital essence to all\nand brings them to completion.\n\n**Master Róng says:**\nAdvancing yet appearing to retreat—\nadvancing without advancing.\nRetreating yet appearing to advance—\nretreating without retreating.\nIlluminating yet appearing obscure—\nnot true illumination.\nObscure yet appearing illuminated—\nnot true obscurity.\nThe Supreme Dao is neither advancing nor retreating,\nneither illuminated nor obscure,\nwithout color, without sound,\nwithout form, without name.\nThough nameless, what name does it not establish?\nThough formless, what form does it not manifest?\nThus, it spreads *qi* and transforms,\nlending life to all existence,\nacting yet not relying,\nentrusting to the natural order.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Lending\"* means borrowing.\nThis nameless Dao possesses great compassion,\nthus it descends to save all beings,\nborrowing its virtuous power\nto shelter all creatures,\nnurturing the Three Realms,\nemploying myriad expedients\nto guide them toward fulfillment.\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Generates One**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous,\nfor the prior expounds the Dao’s transformative power—\ngenerous in lending, accomplished in creation—\nthus this chapter clarifies what it generates,\nthough without sequential order.\n\nIts meaning unfolds in three distinctions:\nFirst, it reveals the Dao’s transformative power in generation,\nSecond, it displays the nature of things and exhorts adherence to harmony,\nThird, it elaborates on gentleness and weakness as the foundation of cultivation.\n\n**First: Revealing the Dao’s Transformative Power in Generation**\n\nFrom the One *qi*, refined,\nits principle penetrates the mysteries of subtlety.\nThe Three Pure Ones emerge first,\ntheir essence returning to the Supreme Void.\nSome ride cloud-dragons through the Great Net,\nyet unseen when viewed;\nsome strike zithers and drums to ascend the Precious Realm,\nyet unheard when listened to.\nVacuous and insubstantial, they emerge among mortals;\nserene and silent, they transcend all forms.\nThough chariots and cavalry fill the roads,\nLaozi dines with the common folk at the lips of the people,\nyet moves without exertion.\nThe Celestial Sovereign sits upon the dust of the earth—\nthus it is known:\nthe Dao generates the Three Blows, embracing yin and yang,\nall receiving the harmonious, stabilizing power of the True Mystery.\n\nThe Dao generates One,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nThe Dao generates One—\nOne generates Two—\nOne is the harmonious *qi*.\nThe Dao emits harmonious, wondrous *qi*,\nyet insufficient for generation,\nso it generates yang *qi*.\nYang *qi* alone cannot sustain life,\nso it generates yin *qi*.\nAccumulating the One’s harmonious *qi*,\nthus it is said, *\"One generates Two.\"*\nAccumulating the Two’s yang *qi*,\nthus it is said, *\"Two generates Three.\"*\nThree generates all things—\nyin and yang embrace and conceive,\nharmonious *qi* adjusts and refines,\nthus it is said, *\"Three generates all things.\"*\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThe Dao is the divine origin of the utmost vacuity,\nOne is the refined essence of harmonious *qi*,\n*\"Generate\"* means dynamic emergence.\nThe Dao dynamically emits harmonious *qi*\nto generate all things.\nYet in its transformative principle,\nthis alone is insufficient—\nit further generates yang *qi*.\nAccumulating yang *qi* to complete the One,\nthus it is called *\"Two.\"*\nPure yang alone cannot generate,\nso it generates yin *qi*.\nAccumulating yin to complete the Two,\nthus it is called *\"Three.\"*\nThree generates all things—\nwhen yin and yang harmonize,\nharmonious *qi* becomes pure,\nthus all existence is born.\nThis clarifies the meaning:\nthe Dao’s transformative power is generous in lending and accomplished in creation.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\n*\"The Dao generates One\"*—\nthe Dao’s first generation is One.\n*\"One generates Two\"*—\nOne generates yin and yang.\n*\"Two generates Three\"*—\nyin and yang generate the Three Pure *qi* of clear and turbid,\ndividing into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n*\"Three generates all things\"*—\nHeaven, Earth, and Humanity together generate all things.\nHeaven bestows, Earth transforms,\nHumanity nurtures them.\n\n**Master Róng says:**\n*\"The Dao generates One\"*—\nfrom the void, *qi* stirs, hence *\"the Dao generates.\"*\nUndifferentiated primordial *qi*, hence *\"One.\"*\n*\"One generates Two\"*—\nclear and turbid separate, yin and yang manifest.\n*\"Two generates Three\"*—\nthe Two *qi* operate the Three Realms.\n*\"Three generates all things\"*—\nthe round Heaven covers above,\nthe square Earth bears below,\nHumanity governs between—\nwhat thing does not arise?\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nOne is the primordial *qi*.\nTwo is yin and yang.\nThree is Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\nAll things are all sentient and insentient beings.\nThe Supreme Dao’s mysterious origin,\nits essence transcending form and name,\ndescending from its root,\nfirst generating primordial *qi*,\nthen from primordial *qi* transforming into yin and yang.\nThus, yang *qi* ascends, clear and pure, becoming Heaven,\nyin *qi* descends, turbid and heavy, becoming Earth.\nThe Two *qi* ascending and descending,\nharmonious *qi* becomes Humanity—\nthe Three Realms arise,\nthen all things are generated in sequence,\nto illustrate the Dao’s power of generous lending.\n\n---\n**Second: Displaying the Nature of Things and Exhorting Adherence to Harmony**\n\nAll things embrace yin while cradling yang,\nharmonious *qi* as their balance.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nAll things, by receiving yin and yang’s harmonious *qi*,\nare generated—\nthus they embrace yin and cradle yang,\nnurturing harmonious *qi* as their gentleness.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**\nThings, in their generation,\nrely on yin and yang’s harmonious *qi* to be complete—\nthey must bear yin and embrace yang,\ncherish harmonious *qi* as their gentleness.\nThus, Guangchéngzǐ instructed the Yellow Emperor:\n*\"I guard the One and embrace harmony,\nthus my cultivation has reached twelve hundred years,\nyet my form has never decayed.\"*\nIt is known that primordial *qi*, harmonious and gentle,\nis what all creatures depend upon.\nLaozi cites this to show:\nsince humanity abandons harmonious *qi* to generate,\n*qi* is the foundation of life—\nthus, one must preserve gentleness and weakness,\nthis is preserving the root.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nAll things embrace yin while facing yang—\nall things without fail embrace yin and turn toward yang,\ntheir hearts returning to the sun.\n\nThe harmonious *qi* of the **Chong** is the foundation of all things—\nwithin every creature lies primordial *qi*,\nwhich, when balanced and gentle, sustains life.\nAs in the chest where essence is stored,\nor in bones where marrow resides,\nor in plants where hollow spaces allow *qi* to flow—\nit is through this void and *qi* that longevity is attained.\n\n**Master Róng says:**\nIf yang *qi* is hot and solitary,\nit cannot generate life;\nif yin *qi* is cold and lone,\nit cannot form shape.\nThus, one must align with the **Great Dao** to harmonize it,\nborrow the **Chong** *qi* to balance it—\nthis is how life is sustained.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang—\n*bear* means to turn away, *embrace* means to face.\nYang is life, yin is death.\nAll things, sentient or not,\nwithout fail turn away from yin and toward yang,\ncherishing life and shunning death—\nyet though they shun death, they cannot escape it,\nand though they love life, they never fully attain it.\nThe Sage pities them, thus below follows the discourse on eternal life.\n\nThe **Chong** *qi* is harmony—\n*Chong* means central, *he* means compliant.\nTo seek immortality, one must hold the heart upright,\npracticing humility, gentleness, and weakness—\nthis is the way of eternal life.\nHence it is said below:\n*\"The rigid and strong are doomed to death,\nthe gentle and weak are destined to life.\"*\n\n**Third Discourse on Gentle Weakness as the Foundation of Practice:**\nWhat humanity despises—\nthe titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—\nare adopted by kings and nobles as their own.\n**御注:** All things rely on the harmonious *qi* of the **Chong** as their root,\nand those who preserve its gentle weakness must cultivate humility.\nThus, though kings and nobles hold the highest rank,\nthey adopt the titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—\nfor humility and gentleness are their foundation.\n\n**御疏:** The **Chong** *qi* is gentle and weak,\nthe root of life—\nthus kings and nobles uphold humility to reinforce this principle.\n*Naolǎo Bùgǔ* are terms of misfortune,\nnot titles of honor,\nyet they are embraced by kings and nobles—\nthis is the ultimate in humility.\nKings and nobles are the models of civilization,\ntheir fate determining life and death for all under heaven.\nIf they do not uphold gentleness to secure the realm,\nthe people will not follow.\nThus, they take humility as their root,\nto achieve their towering virtue.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\n*Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—terms of ill omen—\nare adopted by kings and nobles as their titles,\nfor they embody humility,\nconforming to emptiness, harmony, and gentleness.\n\n**Master Róng says:**\nThose who embrace the harmonious **Chong** *qi*\nhold neither preference nor aversion.\nIf one strays from the **One Principle**,\nlove and hatred arise.\nYet those who cling to titles of wealth and honor\ndo not delight in *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—\nonly the Daoist kings and nobles\npreserve themselves through these names,\nfor humility and retreat are their essence.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**\nLoneliness and widowhood are misfortunes,\nyet kings and nobles adopt them as their titles—\nthis shows that nobility lies in embracing what is low,\nand exaltation rests on what is humble.\nThus, those who seek cultivation must govern their hearts with humility and compliance.\n\nThings may be diminished yet flourish,\nor increased yet decline.\n**御注:** Those who diminish themselves are benefited by others;\nthose who seek self-gain are diminished by others.\nThus, those who submit to the **Dao** are good at yielding,\nand gentleness holds the power of virtue.\nThe titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ* are fitting.\n\n**御疏:** *Gu* (故) continues the previous thought.\n*Shǔn* means to belittle or disparage.\nKings and nobles adopt the titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ* to disparage themselves,\nand thus the people joyfully promote them,\nrevering and serving them—\ntheir governance is thereby strengthened.\nOr, if they enrich themselves while in power,\ngrowing arrogant, the people scatter and governance weakens.\nAs the *Shū* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain.\"*\nThis is the meaning.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\nThus, things may be diminished yet benefit,\nor drawn yet resist—\npushed, they return.\nOr they may be increased yet decline—\nthe higher they rise, the more they crumble;\nthose who feast on wealth and honor see their governance fade.\n\n**Master Róng says:**\nThe Daoist king, though wealthy and honored,\nadopts the titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—\nthis is diminishment.\nYet his humility shines anew each day—\nthis is benefit.\nWithout virtue, one clings to empty honor,\nelevating oneself only to fall—\nthis is diminishment.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**\nHumility and gentleness diminish the self to benefit others—\nothers will gather to it, thus preserving life.\nArrogance and boasting benefit the self while oppressing others—\nothers will resist it, leading to peril and ruin.\nPeril and ruin are diminishment;\npreserving life is benefit.\nThe verification of gain and loss is thus clear—\nhence it is said: *\"Diminish and yet benefit, increase and yet decline.\"*\n\nThe teachings given to others\nare also my teachings.\n**御注:** Laozi says:\nWhen rulers wish to establish teachings for the people,\nthey must use my principles of gentle weakness and humility to instruct them.\n\n**御疏:** *Rén* refers to the ruler.\nThe ruler is the first to set the example in governance,\nand the moral character of the nation depends on one person’s transformation.\nThus, Laozi emphasizes:\nWhen rulers wish to implement teachings to transform the people,\nthey must use my principles of emptiness, humility, and gentle weakness to guide them.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**\n*The teachings given to others*—\nthis refers to how the common people teach one another,\nshifting from weakness to strength,\nfrom gentleness to rigidity.\n*I also teach them*—\nmeaning I teach the people to shift from strength to weakness,\nfrom rigidity to gentleness.\n\n**Master Róng says:**\nWhen asked about the teachings to be practiced,\nthey align with *rén* (benevolence) and *yì* (righteousness),\nyet rigidity and strength are the path of death,\nwhile benevolence and righteousness are the adornments of the **Dao**.\n*Also my teachings*—\nmeaning to abandon rigidity and strength,\nto preserve gentleness and weakness,\nto distance oneself from benevolence and righteousness,\nand to rest in **Dao** and virtue.\nIt is also said:\nThe Sage is the teacher,\nthe masses are the taught—\nthe teacher and taught must align properly.\n*Yì* means proper.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**\nCommon scholars and Confucian teachers also uphold gentleness,\nyet my teachings emphasize stillness and retreat.\nThough their gentleness may still cling to rigid doctrines,\nmy stillness and retreat value emptiness and forgetting—\nthus, they differ.\n\nThe strong and violent shall not die their natural death.\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Those who are strong and violent act in opposition to all things, seeking gain while causing harm. When others strike back, they do not die their natural death.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** \"Strong and violent\" refers to those who are harsh, domineering, and inflexible. Such violent men neglect the essentials of nurturing life and will inevitably cut short their natural lifespan, dying before their time rather than in old age. The annotation states: \"They act in opposition to all things, and others strike back.\" *Antagonize* means *to oppose*; \"others strike back\" is as in the *Yì Jīng* (Book of Changes), *Yì* (Benefit) Hexagram, Upper Nine line: \"No benefit comes to him, others strike him.\"\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: \"The strong and violent are those who reject the mysterious and profound, who rebel against virtue and the Dao, who do not follow the teachings, and who rely on power and force. To not die their natural death means they are cut down by Heaven’s decree, felled by weapons, or executed by royal law, unable to die in their appointed time.\"\n\n**Master Yán** said: \"Strong Qin perished through tyranny, while Great Han flourished through harmony and compliance. The strong and violent lose the Dao; the rigid and hasty lose their spirit—how could they endure?\"\n\n**Master Róng** said: \"The strong and violent shall not die their natural death—I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation. Those who do not obey their sovereign and parents, who do not follow the Sage’s teachings, who indulge in empty glory and cling to victory, who exalt themselves and oppress others—these are the strong and violent. They violate laws and transgress statutes, do not fulfill their allotted years, and die prematurely, not attaining their natural death.\n\nAll things conform to the Dao; the Sage does not fail to instruct. When human nature strays from reason, the Master of Transformation speaks to them through the sevenfold adornments of virtue, revealing the substance of the Dao. By addressing the nature of the strong and violent, the teachings unfold the method of gentleness and weakness. *Foundation* refers to the origin—taking the strong and violent as the foundation of instruction.\"\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:** \"The strong and violent shall not die their natural death—I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation.\" *Strong and violent* is the same as *rigid and hasty*; *foundation* means *beginning*. It states that those who are strong and violent must perish prematurely, unable to die in accordance with Heaven’s decree. Though the Venerable Master expounds many teachings and subtle methods, he consistently upholds gentleness and weakness as good, and rigidity and strength as evil—this is most fitting, making it the first principle for those who seek the Dao. *I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation.*\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** I have seen the strong and violent perish, while the gentle and weak survive; thus, I take this teaching of gentleness and weakness as the foundation for all teachings.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** *Foundation* means *origin*. This sentence establishes the root of cultivation. The Venerable Master uses the perishing of the strong and violent as a warning and the survival of the gentle and weak as encouragement. To take this as the foundation of teaching means that, like a child to a parent, this teaching of gentleness and weakness is the origin of all teachings.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: *Foundation* means *beginning*. The Venerable Master takes the strong and violent as the initial admonition for teaching.\n\n---\n**Chapter 43: The Most Gentle in the World**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter clarifies that the teaching of gentleness and weakness is the first principle of seeking the Dao. Thus, this chapter is placed next to further reveal the power of gentleness and weakness and the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\nWithin this chapter, the text has three layers:\n1. It presents an analogy to show that gentleness overcomes rigidity.\n2. It explains how gentleness and weakness can enter without obstruction.\n3. It concludes with a sigh of praise for *wuwei*, calling it a rare and precious teaching.\n\n**First: Presenting an analogy to show that gentleness overcomes rigidity.**\nThe five elements all have their uses, yet the spirit of water is the most enduring. The four great elements manifest form, yet none surpasses the utmost gentleness. It gallops across the world, surging against the most rigid obstacles—like the August Floods of the eighth month, when the waters of Du Junping rose in Shu, or the autumnal voyages of Meng Qiang entering Qin. The River Peng shines brightly, its clear currents deep and still, reflecting the Dao of water—without intention, yet pure and undivided—thus it can generate gentleness and weakness. Borrowing this as an analogy, its inexhaustible flow draws one near to the Dao.\n\nThe most gentle in the world\ncan gallop across the most rigid in the world.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** The most gentle in the world is one’s true nature. If one is entangled in worldly affairs, stained by the dust of existence, and overwhelmed by desires, then one becomes the most rigid in the world.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** Human nature, in its original state, is pure and harmonious. When *qi* is balanced within, it is the utmost gentleness. But if one is swept away by desires, stained by worldly attachments, and seduced by sounds and colors, then true nature disperses, becoming the utmost rigidity.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: The most gentle is water; the most rigid is metal and stone. Water can penetrate rigidity and enter hardness—there is nothing it cannot pass through.\n\n**Master Yán** said: The Dao can traverse and govern all things under Heaven.\n\n**Master Róng** said: Among tangible things, the most gentle is water. Among the formless, the most gentle is the Dao. Water, though most gentle, can dissolve metal and pierce stone, breaking through rigidity. The Dao, though most gentle, can abandon the self and others, breaking through fixed attachments. If one mirrors oneself in water and embodies the Dao, one can penetrate the distinctions of self and others, traverse mountains and valleys without obstruction—this subtle and mysterious passage is the galloping across the utmost rigidity.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:** The most gentle is water; the most rigid is metal. *Galloping* means *attacking and penetrating*. It states that water, though most gentle, can attack and penetrate the rigidity of metal, illustrating how *wuwei*, though seemingly weak, can break the burdens of *youwei* (action). Hence, the following text says: \"In the world, nothing is more gentle than water, yet in attacking rigidity, nothing surpasses it.\"\n\n**Second: Explaining how gentleness and weakness can enter without obstruction.**\nThere is nothing that can enter without obstruction.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** There is nothing that can enter without obstruction—I know this to be the benefit of *wuwei*. *There is nothing* means not being stained by the dust of existence, making the heart empty of all attachments. *Without obstruction* refers to the Dao’s pure and undivided nature, its mysterious and unified body, with no gaps or separations. If one is not disturbed by desires, making both heart and environment still, empty of all attachments, then the heart aligns with the Dao and enters without obstruction.\n\nThus the Sage says, *\"I see that when the body and mind are pure and clear, they naturally align with the Dao—this is how I know that the teachings of *youwei* are inferior to *wuwei*.\"*\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\n*\"Wuwei\"* refers to one who awakens to all dharmas, empty of all attachments, and thus returns to their original nature, merging with the Dao and entering *wujian*.\n*\"Wujian\"* is the Dao. *\"Ru\"* means \"to merge.\"\nThe Dao is called *wujian* because its nature is pure and boundless, unified without gaps or separations.\n\n**River Upper Master says:**\n*\"Wuwei\"* is the Dao. The Dao has no form or substance, thus it can move freely without obstruction, transcending the spirit and benefiting all beings.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe spirit and clarity reside within the body, moving without obstruction—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n**Rong says:**\nWater encounters no obstruction; the Dao has no form. Where there are no gaps, it enters everywhere.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\n*\"Jian\"* means \"gap.\" Those lost in illusion see emptiness as existence, while those of enlightened vision see existence as emptiness—thus, *\"wuwei.\"*\nThe teachings of *youwei* are flawed and thus have gaps, while *wuwei* is subtle and seamless, allowing one to enter the profound truth of *wuwei* and *youwei* as one.\nThis is why I know the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\n*\"Wu\"* refers to Laozi speaking of himself. This chapter also instructs rulers, teaching them to govern the world through *wuwei*.\nThus Laozi says, *\"I see that all beings possess a natural gentleness, but when they chase after ambition and competition, they become rigid and strong. If one illuminates and awakens the mind, empty of all attachments, they will merge with the Dao.\"*\nThis shows that the principle of *wuwei* and purity benefits both governance and the self, and is more beneficial to people than the teachings of *youwei*.\n\n**River Upper Master says:**\n*\"I see that the Dao acts through *wuwei*, yet all things are spontaneously transformed—this is how I know the benefit of *wuwei* for people.\"*\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe Dao is formless, yet things are formed; the Sage acts through *wuwei*, yet people are transformed—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\nGentleness can overcome rigidity; emptiness can dissolve existence—thus, I know that the teaching of *wuwei* greatly benefits those who cultivate the Way.\n\n**Third: Concluding with a sigh over the rare teaching of *wuwei*.**\nThe teaching of *wuwei*—unspeakable and beneficial—is rarely attained by the world.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nIt says that among all teachings in the world, few can attain *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThe supreme Dao is wordless; things arise through it. The Sage acts through *wuwei*; transformation is pure. Only when one does not rely on spoken words does teaching take form.\nFew in the world can attain it, meaning that among the hundred schools, few can follow the teaching of *wuwei*. Again, it says that unless one embodies the Dao, none can attain it—thus, *\"rare.\"*\n\n**River Upper Master says:**\nThe teaching of *wuwei* follows the Dao without words, guiding by example. The benefit of *wuwei* is that governing the self strengthens the spirit, and governing the state benefits the people without labor or trouble.\n*\"Few in the world can attain it\"* refers to rulers—few can follow the Dao of *wuwei*. The governance of self and state is the same.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe sound that can be heard reaches a hundred *li*, but the soundless sound moves beyond all boundaries.\nWhat is spoken is understood by others, but the unspeakable is subtly expressed—like the response of Heaven and Earth, or the silent workings of the Dao and virtue, where Heaven and Earth act without speech, and the four seasons cycle endlessly.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe teaching of *wuwei* and its benefits—previously mentioned—are not yet known. To practice the unspeakable teaching is to forget speech, to follow natural processes is to find no tasks, and thus the ruler is at ease above, the subjects content below—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n*\"Few in the world can attain it\"* means many follow *youwei*, but few attain *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\n*\"Unspeakable\"* does not mean closing the mouth. In principle, it is both existence and nonexistence; in teaching, it is both speech and silence—thus called the unspeakable teaching.\nIt is both existence and nonexistence, thus called the benefit of *wuwei*.\nThe benefit is not a benefit yet is a benefit; the teaching is not a teaching yet is a teaching—this is the ultimate expression of nature and principle, a rare discourse in the world. Few conventional teachings can reach it, hence *\"rare.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Which is dearer, name or body?**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which praised gentleness as the pivot of the Dao, thus explaining that contentment and detachment from desire are essential to true cultivation.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:\n1. A hypothetical scenario with three questions, weighing gain and loss,\n2. An exposition on how clinging to fame and profit harms wisdom and the body,\n3. A demonstration that contentment and detachment can lead to longevity.\n\n**First: A hypothetical scenario with three questions, weighing gain and loss.**\nHeaven and Earth have form, yet they are uneven—east and west tilt and lack completeness. Yin and Yang contain substance, yet their relationship is like a mother and child, one giving birth to the other, only to perish.\nThus the question arises: *\"Which is dearer, name or body? Which is more painful to lose, gain or loss?\"*\n\nThe virtuous Bo Yi abandoned his noble status at Mount Shouyang, while Wu Zixu, seeking fame, drowned himself in the Yi River.\nThe Duke of Zhou declined his title, and Emperor Yao refused the throne when offered.\nThe four sages followed the Way of *wuwei*, while the two men endured hunger and poverty—why?\nBecause fame and position are hollow; Xiang Yu lamented his lost kin, and wealth and honor harm the body—Confucius sighed at his white hair.\n*\"Excessive love leads to great loss\"*—this is the true saying of the Sage, worthy of sincere belief.\n\n**Which is dearer, name or body?**\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\n*\"Name\"* is the guest of *\"reality.\"* People sacrifice their bodies for fame—this question asks which is dearer, urging one to abandon功 and 名 (*gong* and *ming*), preserving their true self.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary states: Here, fame is weighed against the body. *Na* (孰) means \"who.\" The detailed question asks: If one strives for glory and fame while preserving life, and these two paths are set apart—then which aligns more closely with the Dao of preserving one’s true self and extending years? It laments how people sacrifice their bodies for others’ fame.\n\nMaster He Shang said: To retreat from fame is to bathe in virtue.\n\nMaster Rong said: Between fame and body, which is dearer? Between body and wealth, which is more abundant? Between gain and loss, which brings greater harm? Fame is the external praise of others; wealth is the common man’s silk and jade. The body is the foundation of loyalty and filiality, the bedrock of virtue and Dao. One must abandon external fame and profit, nurture the body and spirit, return to *wuwei*, cultivate the Supreme Way—yet those who perish forget this, and those who chase desires lose their true nature. Thus, fame becomes the blade that slays the body, and wealth the poison that harms the self. Many are lost in delusion, and the Sage pities them. Hence the detailed question: Is it sickness to seek fame and profit? Is it sickness to lose them? The vulgar see fame and profit as good, yet gaining them brings death, losing them brings virtue. To lose is to stand firm; to gain is to perish. Who can discern the sickness of gain and loss? *Wang* (亡) means \"lose.\"\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary states: The body is the inner self, the true essence. Fame is external, a guest. *Na* (孰) means \"who.\" All men seek the external while destroying the inner, greedily pursuing fame while losing substance. What is this? Praise and glorious name are originally for the sake of the body—yet if the body dies for fame, to what end does the fame serve?\n\nThe Old Master, moved by this inversion, asked: Between fame and body, which do you hold dear—yet you feast on fame while forgetting the body? By this measure, the distinction between dear and distant becomes clear. Hence *Zhuangzi* says: \"Bo Yi died for fame beneath Mount Shouyang.\"\n\nBetween body and wealth, which is more abundant?\nThe Master’s Commentary: Those who pursue fame will seek wealth, yet gaining wealth destroys the body. The question asks which is more, urging one to cast away jade and shatter pearls to preserve harmony.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: \"More\" signifies what is precious and weighty. When body and wealth are set apart, which should be valued? This is asked to awaken the realization that the body is more precious than wealth. The note on casting jade and shattering pearls comes from *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters.\n\nMaster He Shang said: Wealth in excess harms the body.\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary: Wealth is originally for the body’s use, yet deluded men sacrifice their lives for it. Thus the Old Master reproaches: Do you discard wealth to preserve the body—is that more beneficial? Or hoard wealth while losing the body—is that more beneficial? Hence *Zhuangzi* says: \"Zhi the Robber died for profit upon the Eastern Ridge.\"\n\nBetween gain and loss, which brings greater harm?\nThe Master’s Commentary: It asks whether gaining fame and wealth or losing them brings greater sickness to the body.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: This summarizes the two questions: Does gaining fame and wealth or losing them bring sickness? Gaining them destroys the body; preserving the body means losing them. The distinction is clear—sickness is evident. Yet deluded men fail to awaken first, so the later text elaborates the answer.\n\nMaster He Shang said: Coveting gain brings sickness to conduct.\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary: Those who greedily seek wealth will surely perish, while those with few desires and no wealth preserve their bodies. Thus, gaining is the sign of self-destruction, losing is the proof of self-preservation. Self-destruction is sickness; self-preservation is medicine. Yet the world reverses this, calling gain fortune and loss sickness—is this not perverse? Hence the teaching asks: Between gain and loss, which is truly sickness?\n\nThe second point clarifies how indulging in fame and profit diminishes wisdom and harms the body. Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss, and hoarding brings thick ruin.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: Those who love excessively must expend greatly. Those who hoard wealth burden the body—this is thick ruin.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: These two sentences answer the prior questions. \"Excessive love leads to great loss\" responds to *name and body, which is dearer?* Loss here means \"harm.\" The dearer one holds fame, the more they strain their nature, depleting spirit and mind. The more they love, the greater the expenditure. \"Hoarding brings thick ruin\" responds to *body and wealth, which is more abundant?* The more wealth is stored, the greater its ruin—whether through theft or grave robbery, the attacks on jade and pearls, or the plundering of books and tombs. The harm of wealth serves as a solemn warning.\n\nMaster He Shang said: Excessive love leads to great loss. Those who love beauty excessively drain their vital essence; those who love wealth excessively invite disaster. The less one loves, the less one loses—hence it is called \"great loss.\" Hoarding brings thick ruin: In life, wealth is stored in granaries; in death, in graves. The living face banditry and robbery; the dead face grave desecration.\n\nMaster Rong said: Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss—using fame to kill the body is great loss. Hoarding brings thick ruin—using wealth to harm the self is thick ruin.\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary: Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss. Loss means \"harm.\" This explains fame: Those who excessively love praise and reputation must greatly tax their form and spirit, depleting their vitality and wisdom. This sentence resolves the question of fame.\n\nHoarding brings thick ruin.\nThe Master’s Commentary: Those who hoard wealth in granaries will face robbery, not only losing their goods but also endangering themselves. Their ruin is deep and severe. Hence the *Book of Documents* says: \"An innocent man with a jade boulder bears guilt.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"The great scholar recited: 'The green wheat grows on the ridge.' He did not distribute in life, so why hoard pearls in death?\" Thus, they struck his jaw with a hammer, pried apart his cheeks—lest the pearl in his mouth remain unharmed. This sentence resolves the question of wealth.\n\n---\n\n**Third, the enlightened know contentment and abandon greed, thus enduring long.**\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nthus one endures long.\n\n**Master’s Annotation:**\nKnowing contentment means not loving excessively.\nKnowing restraint means not hoarding excessively.\nSince there is neither disgrace nor peril,\none may endure long.\n\n**Master’s Detailed Commentary:**\nDisgrace means loss and burden;\nPeril means danger and ruin.\nHe who does not seek fame is content.\nHe who does not amass wealth knows restraint.\nKnowing contentment, fame aligns with truth without excess burden.\nKnowing restraint, wealth is not hoarded, and greed brings no harm.\nWithout disgrace or peril,\none may endure and live long.\n\n**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace—\nthe contented cut ties with gain, reject desire,\nand suffer no disgrace to the self.\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nwhen one knows when to stop,\nwealth and profit do not burden the self,\nand sounds and colors do not confuse the senses—\nthus one remains free from danger all life.\nThus one endures long.\nIf people know restraint and contentment,\nfortune and blessings lie within themselves.\nFor those who nurture their bodies, the spirit labors not;\nfor those who govern the state, the people are undisturbed—\nthus one endures long.\n\n**Honor’s Commentary:**\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace—\nnot seeking fame beyond measure,\none avoids shame.\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nnot scheming for wealth beyond reason,\none avoids danger.\nThus one endures long.\nBy distancing oneself from fame and profit,\none avoids peril and danger.\nIn governing the state, one may endure long;\nin cultivating the self, one may live long.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace—\nunderstanding wealth’s falsity,\nguarding one’s portion without greed,\npure and serene in contentment,\none knows no shame—\nthis concludes the discussion on wealth.\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nhaving awakened to the emptiness of praise,\none stops without attachment,\npreserving the self and avoiding harm,\nthus suffering no peril.\nThe previous passage said: *\"Fame, once attained, must be known to cease.\"*\nThis concludes the discussion on fame.\nThus one endures long—\nknowing restraint in fame,\nknowing contentment in wealth,\nwithout fame or profit,\none may endure long.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Completion as if Deficient**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor though the previous spoke of knowing contentment and restraint,\nit did not yet complete the Dao’s cultivation.\nThus this chapter reveals the Great Completion,\ndemonstrating the emptiness of false practices.\nWithin this chapter, three themes unfold:\nFirst, a broad exposition of the Five Great [principles],\nas a model for learning and conduct;\nSecond, parables illustrating how the restless and inferior pale beside stillness;\nThird, the culmination of the virtues of stillness.\n\n**First: A Broad Exposition of the Five Great [principles], as a Model for Learning and Conduct**\n\nHe who forges the vast furnace,\nbearing the Tortoise Mountain and calling it great—\nthe artisan’s skill is refined;\nspanning the realm of Peng’s wings to achieve height.\nEncompassing all within the One Qi,\nit appears as if deficient—\nembracing the seven layers within,\nit functions as if empty.\nThus one knows the Emperor’s form, misty and indistinct,\nmirroring the void in the palm—\nthe utmost precision, elusive and vague;\nstoring the cosmos in the heart’s field.\nStepping through the Dark Path without end,\npushing the Great Bend without measure,\nthe pure and still wind fans far—\nthen the Nine Ranks act without effort,\nthe Way of tranquil ease is vast—\nthen all the people prosper.\nThe instrument of Great Completion\nis realized here.\n\n**The Great Completion as if Deficient—**\nits use is unexhausted.\n\n**Master’s Annotation:**\nWhen learning and conduct reach Great Completion,\nthey remain as if stained and deficient—\nhumility brings benefit—\nthus their use is never exhausted.\n\n**Master’s Detailed Commentary:**\nAll who study the Dao,\nwhen their virtues are complete and rounded,\nmust ever forget themselves,\nas if stained and deficient.\nThus their use is endless.\nThe Sage-King of Great Completion and Virtue\nis likewise—\nequal to Heaven and Earth in nurturing,\nmatching the Sun and Moon in illumination,\nhis achievements vast—\nhence, *Great Completion*.\nYet he does not rely on his completion,\nremaining as if stained and deficient—\nthus his use is unexhausted.\n\n**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**\n*The Great Completion as if Deficient*—\nthe Sage-King of Great Completion and Virtue,\nas if deficient—\nerasing name, concealing praise,\nlike a broken vessel.\nIts use is unexhausted—\nwhen the heart is thus,\nits use knows no end.\n\n**Honor’s Commentary:**\nThe Dao is complete, virtue fulfilled—\nthis is Great Completion,\nyet it appears as if lacking—\nhence, *as if deficient*.\nYet the Great Abyss draws from it without depletion,\nthe bright mirror reflects without weariness—\nits use is unexhausted.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThose whose conduct and practice reach Great Completion\nforget their completion,\nso though complete,\nthey appear as if deficient.\nBecause they forget completion and deficiency,\nthe more they act, the more their use is unexhausted.\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Small completion hides the Dao.\"*\nThe complete is not deficient,\nthe deficient is not complete—\nyet now the complete appears deficient,\nforgetting deficiency and completion.\nNot seeing completion as different from deficiency,\nit is deficient yet truly complete;\nnot seeing deficiency as different from completion,\nit is complete yet appears deficient.\n\n**The Great Fullness as if Empty—**\nits use is unexhausted.\n\n**Master’s Annotation:**\nWhen blessings and position are full,\nthey remain as if empty—\nfrugality does not deplete wealth,\nthus their use is unexhausted.\n\n**Master’s Detailed Commentary:**\n*Empty* means *void*.\n*Unexhausted* means *not lacking*.\nThis illustrates the Sage-King,\nwhose blessings and position are full,\nyet who practices restraint and self-cultivation,\nnot clinging to fullness—\nthus appearing as if empty.\nAs the *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Having yet appearing as if not having,\nfull yet appearing as if empty,\"*\nthus their use is unexhausted.\n\n**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**\n*The Great Fullness as if Empty*—\nthe Sage-King of great fullness and virtue,\nas if empty—\nnoble yet not arrogant,\nwealthy yet not extravagant.\nIts use is unexhausted—\nwhen the heart is thus,\nits use knows no end.\n\n**Honor’s Commentary:**\nThe Four Reaches are present yet illuminate together,\nthe Six Passages reveal nothing hidden—\nthis is Great Fullness.\nNot using illumination as illumination,\nnot clinging to fullness as fullness—\nthis is *as if empty*.\nUsing without the mind,\nthus without limit.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Chong* is *emptiness*.\n*Qióng* means *exhaustion*.\nIt speaks of those whose Dao and virtue are in great fullness—\nyet they forget their fullness,\nso though full, they appear as if empty and without substance.\nOnly by forgetting fullness and embracing emptiness\ncan their use be inexhaustible.\n\nFor the full is not empty,\nand the empty is not full.\nNow, full yet empty—\nthis is to transcend both fullness and emptiness,\nthus being full yet appearing as if empty.\n\n**Great Straightness as if Bent,**\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nStraight yet not domineering, hence appearing as if bent.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\n*Straight* means *upright*.\n*Bent* means *yielding*.\nThe first four lines elucidate both essence and application;\nhereafter, the next three lines speak only of essence, omitting application.\nThe text is abbreviated to reveal its meaning—\nthe pattern is clear.\n\nTo purify oneself while defiling others,\nto uphold rectitude yet place crookedness—\nthis is *small straightness*.\nNot clinging to truth to refute falsehood,\nnot correcting oneself to rectify others—\nthis is *Great Straightness*.\nYielding to fit circumstances, hence appearing as if bent.\nThe annotation says *straight yet not domineering*—\nthis is the text of the next chapter.\n\n**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**\n*Great Straightness* refers to cultivating the Dao’s laws,\nupright and unchanging as one.\nAs if bent—\nnot contending with the vulgar,\nlike one who can bend and fold,\nleveling shoulders, straightening the body,\nthe Original One flowing uniformly.\n\n**Honor’s Commentary:**\nIn darkness, aligned with the True Path—\nthis is *Great Straightness*.\nFollowing desire to conform to others—\nthis is *as if bent*.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Bent* means *yielding*.\nThose of Great Straightness are plain and unadorned,\nnot displaying their rectitude openly,\nthus blending with the common crowd,\nadapting flexibly to all—\nhence appearing as if bent.\nThus, *upright in conduct* is *small straightness*.\n\n**Great Skill as if Clumsy,**\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nSkill harms through excess, hence appearing as if clumsy.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nBoasting of cosmetic artistry,\nflaunting the intricacies of hooks and lines—\nthis is *small skill*.\nUsing materials appropriately, entrusting success to things,\nnever deviating from their nature—\nthis is *Great Skill*.\nWithout cutting or shaping,\nno trace of craftsmanship remains,\nseeming crude and clumsy.\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Nature carves and molds all forms yet does not claim skill.\"*\n\n**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**\n*Great Skill* refers to possessing many talents.\nAs if clumsy—\npretending not to dare display one’s abilities.\n\n**Honor’s Commentary:**\nThe artisan completes all things—\nthis is *Great Skill*.\nSeeming unable to act—\nthis is *as if clumsy*.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe artisan completes all things,\nthe furnace hammers all life—\nthough possessing great skill, they forget their skill’s use,\nobscuring their brilliance to blend with the ordinary,\nhence appearing as if clumsy.\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Nature carves and molds all forms yet does not claim skill.\"*\nThus, it is known that *craftsmanship* is *small skill*.\n\n**Great Eloquence as if Tongue-Tied,**\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nNot adorning with frivolous speech, hence appearing as if tongue-tied.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nCombining metaphors, embellishing words,\ntying knots in arguments, weaving sentences—\nthis is *small eloquence*.\nPracticing speechless teaching,\neloquently penetrating all things,\nexhausting principles, fulfilling nature—\nthis is *Great Eloquence*.\nAt its peak, speech departs from speech,\nno emphasis or suppression remains,\nas if stammering and tongue-tied.\n\n**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**\n*Great Eloquence*—\nwisdom without doubt.\nAs if tongue-tied—\nno verbal expression.\n\n**Honor’s Commentary:**\nDiscussing Heaven, expounding principles—\nthis is *Great Eloquence*.\nSpeech yet no speech—\nthis is *as if tongue-tied*.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\nWondrously dissecting the True Essence,\nmeasuring the Mysterious Extremes—\nwhat they speak cannot be spoken.\nNot like worldly eloquence, swift and facile,\nhence appearing as if stammering and tongue-tied.\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Unspoken eloquence\"*—\nalso called *Great Eloquence without speech*—\nthus it is known that *Yang-Mo’s petty eloquence* is small.\n\n**Second Analogy, Clarifying That Calm Overcomes Agitation,**\n**Agitation Overcomes Cold, Calm Overcomes Heat.**\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nFor agitation to overcome cold—*cold* means *thin*.\nFor calm to overcome heat—*heat* means *harmony*.\nThus, *as if bent* is *Great Straightness*,\n*clear and tranquil* is the *proper measure*.\nAgitation overcomes cold—\nwhen form moves, fluids flow and disperse.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis analogy serves as instruction.\n\nThose who cling to completion must fail,\nthose who grasp fullness must topple—\nthus the Sage’s work perfects the world,\nyet sees great completion as if lacking,\nso it knows no exhaustion.\nIn exalted station, ruling ten thousand chariots,\nhe views the height of power as if empty,\nso it knows no depletion.\n\nFor fear others may not understand,\nhe uses the movement and stillness of *yang* qi to illustrate.\n\n*Liao* means movement,\n*shèng* means extremity.\nWhen spring and summer, *yang* qi erupts upon the earth,\nall things thrive by its force.\nWhen *yang* qi moves to its extreme, cold arises—\ncold brings decay and death to all things,\nthus proving *liao* as the root of death,\nexcess as the source of decline,\nillustrating that completion without lack must fail,\nfullness without emptiness must topple,\nand those who act with rigid agitation must perish.\n\n*Jìng shèng rè* means:\nin autumn and winter, *yang* qi retreats into the Yellow Springs below,\nstillness to its extreme brings heat—\nheat, the source of life, gives rise to *qi*,\nand all things thrive by it, their birth depending on stillness.\nThus, stillness is the root of life,\nalso the sovereign of agitation.\nTaking this analogy, great completion and great fullness\nderive from the ability to lack and to be empty—\nthus they know no exhaustion, no depletion,\nand achieve life.\n\nThose who can act without striving in purity,\nthen grasp the root of life.\nThis exhorts people to prioritize stillness for nurturing life,\nnot to recklessly agitate toward death.\n\n**River-Upper Master says:**\n*Liao shèng hán*—*shèng* means extremity.\nSpring and summer, *yang* qi moves violently above,\nall things flourish and grow great—\nextreme, they grow cold, cold brings withering and death.\nThis warns against rigid agitation.\n\n*Jìng shèng rè*—in autumn and winter, all things rest in the Yellow Springs below,\nextreme stillness brings heat—\nheat, the source of life.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe two *qi* of yin and yang alternately fulfill their functions—\n*yang* qi moves and grows hot,\nyin qi is still and grows cold.\nWhen *yang* qi is excessive, heat prevails and cold is weak;\nwhen yin qi is excessive, stillness prevails and agitation is weak.\nThis is the shifting order of *qi*, their mutual dominance and decline.\nGreat completion as if lacking,\ngreat fullness as if empty—\nthen there is no true excess.\nIts use knows no exhaustion, no depletion—\nthen there is no true decline.\nNeither excessive nor deficient,\nneither cold nor hot,\nabandoning completion yet not failing,\nforgetting dominance yet not falling short.\n\n**Node Annotation:**\n*Jìng shèng rè*—when without action, spirit remains unified.\n\n**Chen’s Commentary:**\n*Liao* is *yang*,\n*jìng* is yin,\n*shèng* is extremity.\nThe four seasons turn—\nyin reaches its extreme, *yang* arises;\n*yang* reaches its extreme, yin arises.\nYin’s rise brings universal decay.\n*Yang*’s rise brings all things to flourish.\nThis illustrates that stillness is the foundation of longevity,\nagitation the origin of annihilation—\nexhorting students to abandon agitation and return to stillness.\n\n**Further Explanation:**\nDescending from the root, it is *liao shèng hán*.\nRetiring to the source, it is *jìng shèng rè*.\nThis clarifies the proper timing of movement and stillness.\n\n**Third Section: Concluding the Function of Stillness.**\nPurity and stillness are the proper order of the world.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis concludes the previous meaning.\nThe Sage observes the advance and retreat of *yang* qi,\nknowing agitation as the path to death,\nstillness as the root of life.\nGuiding people and nurturing all beings,\nholding to the root to govern the branches,\npracticing the Way of purity and stillness—\nthus he becomes the proper order of the world.\n\n**River-Upper Master says:**\nTo be able to purify and still—\nthen one becomes the eternal ruler of the world,\nupholding rectitude without end.\n\n**Rong says:**\nTo be moved by the cold and heat of yin and yang—\nthis is not yet pure.\nTo be swayed by the flow of life and death—\nthis is not yet still.\nThe Sage remains unchanged by life and death,\nunburdened by cold and heat—\nthis is purity and stillness.\nWith the turning wheel, to dwell in life and death is shameful.\nWithout the turning wheel, to transcend life and death is the proper order of the world.\n\n**Chen’s Commentary:**\nPurity, emptiness, and stillness\ncan benefit oneself and others,\ncorrecting the crooked—\nthus it is the proper order of the world.\nThis concludes the meaning of stillness overcoming agitation.\n\n**Node Annotation says:**\nTo attain the Dao and enter the deep mountains,\nto guard natural purity and stillness—\nthis is the True Person.\n\n*End of Volume Twelve, Mysterious Virtue of the Dao-De Jing*\n*Beginning of Volume Thirteen, Mysterious Virtue Compiled Commentary*\n\n「The *Dao-De Jing* Compiled Commentary by Tang Xuanzong with Imperial Notes and Explanations\n(Annotations by He Shang Gong, Yan Junping, Li Rong, and the *Xihua* Master Chen Xuying,\nwith contributions from Qiang Siqi)\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The World Under the Dao**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nas the prior passage contrasts the two paths—stillness and agitation—\nand their differing outcomes.\nThus, this chapter reveals the distinction between\nthe world under the Dao and the world without it,\nand their respective merits and demerits.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in four layers:\n1) It illuminates the ruler under the Dao,\nwho governs through non-action and emptiness;\n2) It exposes the tyrant without the Dao,\nwhose agitation, competition, and greed are rampant;\n3) It expands upon the deeper roots of agitation and competition,\nwhere blame and discord grow ever heavier;\n4) It demonstrates the beauty of contentment,\nto encourage those who seek cultivation.\n\n**1) Illuminating the Ruler Under the Dao: Non-Action and Emptiness**\n\nThe Dao is profound and mysterious,\nits divine power not constrained by force—\nthe heavens and earth receive it and remain serene and silent,\nthe sages align with it and dwell in perfect ease.\n\nThe wind does not howl through the branches,\nyet Emperor Yao was praised for his harmonious governance in *Yi Mu*,\nthe rain does not flood the fields,\nyet Emperor Shun achieved great peace in *Tai Ping*.\n\nThus, when King Wu overthrew the Shang,\nhe returned to Hua Yang and tended his horses with leisure,\nand when King Tang defeated Jie,\nhe wandered in the Peach Orchard, letting his cattle graze freely.\n\nThe Five Emperors and the Three Sovereigns\nall aligned with the pure winds of virtue,\ntransforming the world beautifully—\nthis shows that even those who ride in triumph\nmust still return to cultivate the Dao.\n\nTherefore, in the age of the Dao,\nthe warhorses are turned back to manure the fields;\nin years without the Dao,\nthe armies of warhorses roam the wilds endlessly.\n\nThe Great Sage instructs us—\nhis words are not in vain.\n\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nthe warhorses are turned back to manure the fields.\n\n**Imperial Note:**\nThe ruler who governs under the Dao\npractices non-action and spontaneous transformation.\nSince he does not indulge in greed,\nthere are no wars—\nthe warhorses are withdrawn,\nand the people may till their fields in peace.\n\n**Imperial Explanation:**\n*However* (却) means to repel and remove.\n*Manure* (粪) refers to cultivating the fields.\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nit means the ruler governs by the Dao,\npracticing non-action and transformation,\nkeeping the four borders at ease,\nwith no military conflicts—\nhe need not annex more lands,\nlest he burden the common folk.\nThus, he repels the warhorses and weapons,\nand the people may freely plow and till their fields.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nit means the ruler himself is under the Dao.\nTo turn back the warhorses for manuring the fields—\nmanuring here means fertilizing the fields.\nFor the ruler, it means withdrawing his vital *yang* essence\nto nourish his own body.\n\n**Li Rong says:**\nWhen the ruler is under the Dao,\nhe dispenses with the swift warhorses,\nand his subjects practice non-action,\nmanuring the fields for cultivation.\nThose who seek the True Way\nabandon their restless, worldly passions,\nand manure their bodies with virtue and the Dao.\nScholars, cutting off their idle, wandering distractions,\nmanure their minds with study and letters.\n\n**Chen Xuying’s Explanation:**\nThe ruler under the Dao\ngoes forth across the world,\nwith weapons laid to rest and martial arts abandoned,\nthe realm pacified and at ease—\ngoverning through non-action,\nhe thus repels the warhorses\nand lets the fields be manured.\n\nFor the cultivation of one’s body,\nit means repelling the six senses—\nthe warhorses of the mind—\nand manuring the heart with the Dao,\nhence Mencius says:\n*\"All men till their fields with manure,\nyet none know how to manure the heart with learning.\"*\n\n**2) Exposing the Tyrant Without the Dao: Agitation, Competition, and Greed**\n\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\n**Imperial Note:**\nThe ruler who lacks the Dao\nindulges in desires and conquests,\nso the armies of warhorses\nproliferate in the borderlands.\n\n**Imperial Explanation:**\n*Outskirts* (郊) means *boundaries*—\nthe contested lands where defenses are held.\nIt speaks of a ruler who does not govern by the Dao,\nwhose realm is barren and unyielding,\nso the warhorses and armies\ntake root in the borderlands,\nnever returning.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nit means the ruler himself lacks the Dao.\nWarhorses breed in the outskirts—\nthe wars never cease,\nand the warhorses remain in the borderlands,\nnever returning.\n\n**Yan Junping says:**\nThe people’s lives\nhang upon the ruler’s decree,\nand the ruler’s foundation\nrests upon the people’s support.\nWhen the ruler is under the Dao,\nthe ten thousand households flourish,\nand the ancestral temples shine;\nwhen the ruler lacks the Dao,\nthe ancestral temples crumble,\nand the people perish—\nthis is the natural response.\n\n**Li Rong says:**\n*Breed* (生) means *to arise*.\nWithout governing by the Dao but instead indulging in martial pursuits,\nhe adorns himself with weapons and wields force,\nfortifying the four borders,\nraising the five armies—\nthus the warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\nFor the cultivation of one’s body,\nit refers to the restless and competitive man,\nwhose heart does not harbor the Dao.\nHe lets the six senses—\nthe warhorses of the mind—\ngallop freely through the dusty world,\nentangled in endless gains and losses,\nrights and wrongs.\n\n**Chen Xuying’s Explanation:**\nThe *outskirts* (郊) are the lands beyond the capital.\nWhen the tyrant rules the world without the Dao,\nhe plunders both people and lands,\ndisturbing the four quarters,\nhis greed for territory endless,\nhis love of war unceasing—\nthus the warhorses and armies\nproliferate in the outskirts.\n\nFor the cultivation of one’s body,\nit speaks of the agitated and competitive man,\nwhose heart does not cherish the Dao.\nHe indulges the six senses—\nthe warhorses of the mind—\ngalloping through the dusty world,\nnever reflecting on the True Way,\nalways clinging to external things—\nthus it is said that the warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nthe warhorses are turned back to manure the fields;\nwhen the world lacks the Dao,\nthe warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\nThis refers to *noon* (午),\nwhen the vital *yang* essence flourishes.\n*Noon* is the hour of the horse,\nso when the heart is bound,\nit turns east;\nwhen it desires west,\nit turns west;\nwhen it desires south,\nit turns south;\nwhen it desires north,\nit turns north.\n\nThe heart has four gates,\nknowing the four directions—\nall it sees by day and night,\nwhen asleep, becomes dreams.\n\nWhen the heart harbors the Dao,\nthe righteous *qi* flows freely,\nnourishing the limbs and moistening the body,\nlengthening the hair and skin in mystic grace—\nthus the warhorses are repelled,\nand their essence is manured within.\n\nWhen the heart lacks the Dao,\nit generates lust and disorder,\nand the warhorses gallop wildly in the outskirts,\ncorrupting the body’s meridians—\nthus it is said that the warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\n**3) Expanding Upon the Heavy Blame of the Agitated and Competitive Heart**\n\nNo sin is greater than *desiring what is desirable*—\n\n**Imperial Note:**\nWhen the heart sees what it desires,\nthis is the greatest sin.\n\n**Imperial Explanation:**\nTo break the law is sin,\nand to covet is to incite.\nThe sin of warhorses breeding in the outskirts\ncomes from the ruler’s greed for land—\nwhen he sees the land as desirable,\nhis desire stirs,\nand he seeks to take it—\nthis is the greatest sin,\nhence it is said:\n*No sin is greater than desiring what is desirable.*\n\n**4) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks: Lust is the Pursuit of Sensual Pleasures.**\n**Honor Says:** No sin is greater than *desiring what is desirable*.\n\n**5) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** Riches and honor cannot restrain themselves.\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** *Caigu* (罪) is the root of suffering—\nwhen one is driven by the realm of beauty before them,\nit is the origin of transgression.\nThus, it is said:\n*Do not see what is desirable,\nso that the heart may not be disordered.*\n\n**6) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** *Desiring what is desirable* refers to the initial stirrings of greed while not yet possessing it—\nits guilt is lighter than that of *unknowing contentment*.\nOne who *unknows contentment*, having obtained yet still craving more,\nbrings upon themselves calamity heavier than guilt.\nBut for those who, having obtained,\nstill lack satisfaction—\ntheir *caigu* (咎) is a fault graver than calamity itself.\n\n**7) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** Such is the heart that covets others’ gains and treasures.\n\n**8) Honor Says:** To cast aside *desiring what is desirable* is to seek nothing beyond,\nand to purify the innate nature is to have no place to go within—\nthus it is said that one *knows contentment*.\nAll actions align with the Dao,\nand there are no matters that lack *contentment*—\nno time of *not-enoughness*,\nonly *contentment*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Restraining oneself within proper bounds,\none practices *contentment*—\nconstantly without deficiency,\nthus it is said that one is *constantly content*.\n\n**9) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** *Contentment* is rooted in *knowing contentment*,\nand *constant contentment* is the absence of desire.\n\n**Honor Says:** *Contentment* is *knowing contentment*—\nits virtue lies in the heart, not in things.\nTo follow proper limits and guard one’s nature,\nthough few in possession, is abundant in essence;\nthough many in possession, yet insatiable desire,\nis truly lacking—\nthus it is said:\n*Contentment is rooted in knowing contentment*,\n*constant contentment* is without desire.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 47: The Chapter of Not Stepping Beyond the Door**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor the previous one clarified the rectification of the Dao,\nshowing that one who *knows contentment* is virtuous,\nwhile one who *unknows contentment* is without the Dao—\nhence this chapter demonstrates\nthat the virtuous one reflects without relying on the heart,\nwhile the one without the Dao relies on the heart\nand cannot reflect.\n\nWithin this chapter alone,\nthree themes unfold:\nFirst, the Sage’s empty mirror—\nreflection without reliance on the heart;\nSecond, the common man’s reliance on the heart,\nyet inability to reflect;\nThird, the reiteration of the empty-reflecting one,\nwho moves yet remains serene.\n\n**First: The Sage’s Empty Mirror, Reflection Without Relying on the Heart**\n\nThe Great Sage does not act,\nthe Perfect One has no heart.\nHe gives birth to the dual forms of purity and impurity—\nwhat need has He of things?\nHe stirs the *qi* of mountains and rivers—\nyet His divine power is unseen.\n\nHe surveys countless voices yet speaks not,\nsits in empty reflection yet finds self-realization—\nthus, without stepping beyond the door,\nthe world knows Him.\nHow could He compare to the King of Zhou’s welcoming of the Marquis of Fang,\nor the empty feasts at the Jade Pool,\nor the First Emperor’s viewing of the sun,\nor the hollow boast of the whip’s might over the stones?\n\nThough His footsteps may traverse the nine desolate regions,\nand His reins tire the eight swift steeds,\nHis gaze widens beyond the door’s threshold,\nand His senses grow ever more bewildered—\nyet the Great Sage reveals Himself without stepping forth.\n\n**Not stepping beyond the door, yet knowing the world.**\n**Imperial Note:** Not stepping beyond the door yet knowing the world,\nnot gazing through the window yet seeing the Way of Heaven—\n*wu gong* (无为) and passive governance,\nissuing no commands beyond the door,\nis to know the principles of ruling the world.\nWhen human affairs are harmonious,\nthe celestial order follows naturally—\nthus, without need for gazing through the window,\nthe Way of Heaven may be known.\n\n**Imperial Explanation:** The virtuous Sage-ruler governs without action,\nissuing no commands beyond the door,\nwhile the pure winds naturally harmonize across the world.\nThis may truly be called knowing the principles of ruling the world.\n\nAgain it is explained: When the sage-ruler teaches well, the realm responds with virtue, and thus without troubling to step beyond the door, the world may be known. Hence the *Yijing* says:\n\n*\"The gentleman speaks forth his words—\nif virtuous, they resonate a thousand li away.\nHow much more so for those nearby!\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**River Above Master** says: The sage knows the world without stepping beyond the door by knowing others through himself, knowing others’ households through his own—thus perceiving the world.\n\n**Rong** says: Observe with the Dao, and no principle remains unseen; illuminate with wisdom, and no matter remains unknown—this is called knowing without action.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: The \"door\" refers to perception and awareness—discriminations like grasping and distinguishing. The sage of the Way, with an empty heart and inner stillness, does not let the mind wander through worldly affairs, yet knows all things under heaven—this is true light illuminating the mundane.\n\n**Not gazing through the window, yet seeing the Way of Heaven.**\n**Imperial Commentary**: Heaven and humanity resonate in harmony; vital essences interflow. When the sage-ruler governs with virtue, the celestial patterns remain unerring, and the five phases are not violated by disorder in yin and yang. Thus the *Shujing* says:\n\n*\"When auspicious omens appear, the winds grow solemn;\ntimely rains fall like admonitions.\nWhen calamities arise, the clouds gather;\nconstant winds blow—*\nif such signs issue from oneself, and their forms manifest in Heaven, why wait to gaze through the window before knowing?\"\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Speech and action—\nthe means by which the gentleman moves Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\n**River Above Master** says: The Way of Heaven and the Way of humanity are one; Heaven and humanity communicate, their vital essences interpenetrating. When the sage-ruler is pure and still, Heaven’s qi aligns; when he is filled with desires, Heaven’s qi grows chaotic. All fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm, arise from within.\n\n**Rong** says: The two luminaries adorn the sky, the five stars gleam in the Han—why must one gaze through the window to see them? To claim \"inner enlightenment\" while gazing through the window is to force interpretations. The Way of Heaven is the natural principle; one need not use snares to catch fish or rabbits, nor labor with words to awaken to ultimate truth—this is seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Window-gazing* is peering with intent; *tao* (牖) are the root orifices. The Way of Heaven is the natural principle—when one sits in forgetfulness of the body, not peering through the orifices, the true heart shines within, revealing the natural Way. This is wisdom illuminating truth.\n\nThe door opens to passage; it is like true light illuminating the mundane. The window’s inner clarity reflects returning to the true source.\n\n**Secondly, it clarifies that ordinary people, through the mind, cannot illuminate.**\nThe farther they go, the less they know.\n\n**Imperial Note**: If one cannot practice *wu wei*, even if commands extend far, one’s grasp of governing principles grows ever slighter.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This explains the ruler who has lost the Way—unable to abide in *wu wei* and humility, he seeks to issue edicts to transform people. The farther his commands reach, the more he strays from *wu wei*, and the fewer his insights into governance.\n\n**River Above Master** says: It is like leaving one’s own home to observe others’ households, leaving one’s own body to observe others’ bodies—the farther one looks, the less one knows.\n\n**Rong** says: Though one traverses the cosmos, one may not recognize mountains and rivers; though one reads all the classics, one may not grasp ultimate truth—this is called ignorance.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: The inverted man cannot illuminate principle; his mind chases after phenomena, ever farther without satisfaction, his knowledge shallow and dim, his discernment lacking.\n\n**Thirdly, it emphasizes those who embody the union of emptiness, stillness, and illumination—still yet able to act.**\nThus the sage knows without action.\n\n**Imperial Note**: Not stepping beyond the door—hence \"without action\"—pure and unadorned, yet knowing the Way of governance.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This further elucidates knowing the world without stepping beyond the door. With no affairs, no action, no commands issued, it is said he does not act. Taking the near from himself, he knows distant things—thus, without my action, people transform of themselves. Why wait for words to issue beyond the door before calling it knowing?\n\n**River Above Master** says: The sage does not ascend to Heaven nor descend into the abyss, yet knows Heaven and Earth—by knowing them with the heart.\n\n**Rong** says: Solitary enlightenment.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Without action* means the mind does not grasp past phenomena, while *knowing* is the ability to perceive truth. The law must ultimately be empty and still—like a mirror hung in a high hall, objects pass before it and are reflected, yet the reflection is without intent. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The sage does not use the mind to illuminate; he illuminates without the mind.\"* This completes the explanation of knowing the world without stepping beyond the door.\n\n**Not seeing yet naming,**\n**Imperial Note**: Not gazing through the window—hence \"not seeing.\" When humanity is harmonious and Heaven obeys, one may name the great peace.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This further elucidates seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window. When the crane cries, its young respond; actions move Heaven—from the small, one may know the great; examining oneself, one may know things. Auspicious omens are summoned by the person himself; thus the transformation of great peace may be attained and spoken of—why wait to gaze before naming?\n\nThe *Shujing* says:\n*\"When the ruler above loves the Dao, the people below love virtue;\nwhen he loves martial prowess, the people below love strength.\"*\nThe sage infers the great from the small, the external from the internal.\n\n**Rong** says: Mystic vision.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Not seeing* means penetrating all phenomena as empty and illusory, with nothing visible. *Naming* means rectifying the names of all things, promulgating manifest teachings. Not seeing yet naming, not responding yet responding—naming without seeing, responding without responding.\n\nThis completes the explanation of seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window.\n\n**Not acting yet achieving.**\n**Imperial Note**: Without issuing commands, yet the world is transformed.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This summarizes the meaning of not stepping beyond and not gazing through the window. If the ruler above has any action, the people below will be disturbed. Now the sage concentrates his spirit, serene and dignified, silently in the hall—ruler without action, people without affairs, the populace prosperous, all transformations accomplished of themselves.\n\n**River Master (He Shang Gong) said:** When the ruler above does no acting, the people below have no affairs, the populace is well-provided and self-sufficient, and all things transform and fulfill themselves naturally.\n\n**Rong said:** This is the fulfillment of naturalness.\n\n**Cheng Commentary:** *Not acting* means concentrating the spirit in stillness and tranquility, surpassing all doing in its subtlety. *Achieving* means transforming all beings and perfecting those who seek the Way—this reveals stillness in motion.\n\n---\n**Chapter 48: The Daily Increase of Learning**\n*Why this chapter follows:* The previous chapter clarified the distinction between the common and the sage’s mind through their differing illumination. Thus, this chapter follows to distinguish the two paths—Daoist and secular—with their differing gains and losses.\n\nThis chapter’s meaning is divided into three parts:\n1. The distinction between Daoist and secular learning, with their differing gains and losses.\n2. The progression through illusory stages to attain the Mysterious Extremes.\n3. The difference between having affairs and having no affairs, and their respective gains and losses.\n\n---\n**1. The Distinction Between Daoist and Secular Learning, with Their Differing Gains and Losses**\n\nThe Dao of the Primordial Void is profound, its essence subtle and its gate difficult to enter. Its meaning is vast, its essence refined—it precedes the Imperial Symbol, surpasses the Great Netherworld Sage. The Celestial Script shines, revealing the eight-cornered brilliance, the Jade Palace conceals the *Bo* [primordial vessel], encompassing the single vehicle’s banner. How could this compare to secular learning, which daily grows ever more extravagant and superficial?\n\nZhang Zhi’s inkwell remains confined within the cage of the *fanglong* [boundary], Yang Xiong’s study is forever entangled in the ferry of life and death. Unable to daily diminish doing, they instead intensify the very walls they face.\n\n**Learning daily increases; the Dao daily diminishes.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** Those who learn daily increase their knowledge and perception. Those who cultivate the Dao daily diminish their deeds and practices. Increasing knowledge is the gradual path of study; diminishing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment. Thus, through increasing, one accumulates merit; through forgetting merit, one attains the Dao itself.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** *For* means cultivation; *diminish* means forgetting and letting go. Those who first seek learning do so to attain knowledge, refining their deeds to correct their faults. Ultimately, they awaken to principle, forgetting speech and letting go of deeds. Hence the Note says: Increasing knowledge is the gradual path of study—speaking of its beginning. Diminishing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment—speaking of its end.\n\n**River Master said:** *Learning daily increases* refers to the studies of governance, teaching, ritual, and music, which daily grow more elaborate in emotion, desire, and ornamentation. *The Dao daily diminishes* refers to the natural Way, where emotion, desire, and ornamentation are daily eroded away.\n\n**Yan said:** This is the abandonment of knowledge. The knowing that comes from non-knowing is the origin of knowing. The teaching that is not taught is the essence of teaching. It is the foundation of divine clarity, the teacher of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Rong said:** *Learning daily increases*—expanding with scrolls, lengthening with perception, sharpening with fame, and multiplying with cravings. *The Dao daily diminishes*—practicing the teaching of non-action, dual forgetting of form and principle, embodying the void and the mysterious, abandoning self and other alike. When one attains non-doing, all doing is lost; when one has no affairs, all affairs are diminished. How much less so the proud, the swollen, the extravagant, and the indulgent!\n\n**Cheng Commentary:** *Learning daily increases*—*for* means cultivation; *learning* means secular learning. Those who cultivate worldly learning sharpen their discriminations, thus their desires daily multiply. *The Dao daily diminishes*—*for the Dao* means cultivating the Way. Those who cultivate the Way attain emptiness and tranquility, so their wisdom and virtue gradually clarify, and their entanglements daily diminish.\n\n---\n**2. The Progression Through Illusory Stages to Attain the Mysterious Extremes**\n\nDiminish again, and again diminish, until reaching non-doing.\n\n**Imperial Note:** Diminish again, and again diminish, until reaching non-doing. Non-doing yet nothing is left undone. Those who learn accumulate deeds; those who cultivate the Dao forget diminishing. Though they diminish deeds, they still retain the intention to diminish. When even this intention is forgotten, they attain the tranquil state of non-doing. Like a mirror reflecting all things without obstruction, thus nothing is left undone.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** *Diminish* refers to diminishing the deeds of those who cultivate the Dao. *Again diminish* refers to eliminating the very intention to forget deeds. Thus, the first diminishing forgets traces, the second diminishing forgets the mind. When both mind and traces are forgotten, one attains the ultimate. Attaining the ultimate is reaching non-doing.\n\n**River Master said:** Diminish again, and again diminish—this diminishes emotions and desires. Again diminishing is the gradual means of removing them. Until reaching non-doing, one should remain serene as an infant, doing nothing at all.\n\n**Rong said:** Merging existence into non-existence is diminishing. Existence departs, non-existence is not forgotten—this is diminishing again. The principle is dark, the truth is still—this is non-doing.\n\n**Cheng Commentary:** Those who learn cling to desires; those who cultivate the Dao cling to non-doing. Though their depths differ, both are equally stagnant. Now, to rectify these two fixations, there is the text of *diminishing again*. First, diminishing diminishes existence; then, diminishing diminishes non-existence. Both extremes are abandoned, reaching the non-doing within unity.\n\n**Non-doing yet nothing is left undone.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** When virtue and the Dao merge, there is nothing they do not accomplish, nothing they do not do.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** Doing entails obstruction; obstruction entails limitations. Now, since there is non-doing, non-doing entails no obstruction, thus nothing is left undone. This is the harmony with the Dao, responding universally and comprehensively. Hence, the earlier volume states: *The Dao is ever non-doing, yet nothing is left undone.*\n\n**Rong said:** To remove burdensome existence, one must return to non-doing. Yet those deluded, hearing of non-doing, sit idle with folded hands, taking cold ashes for the Great Way and a clod of earth for the utmost mind.\n\n---\n\n**Fearful that one might rigidly cling to non-doing, unable to transcend and dissolve [its limitations], it is said: \"Non-doing yet nothing is left undone.\"**\n\n**Non-doing yet nothing is left undone is not true non-doing; having action yet returning to non-doing is not true action.**\nThis is the essence of both learning the Dao and embodying the Dao—both share the same aspiration. Only when motion and stillness both cease does harmony prevail.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** When stillness reaches its depth, motion arises as its manifestation; thus, nothing is left undone. The earlier volume states: *The Dao is ever non-doing yet nothing is left undone.*\n\n**Thirdly, it clarifies the distinction between having affairs and having none—gain and loss differ.**\n**To govern the world, one must always act without interference.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** Non-doing and non-affairs mean the world naturally submits; thus, one may govern the world.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This exhorts the sovereign to practice non-doing. \"To govern\" means to harmonize and transform. To transform the world, one must act without interference and without affairs—without affairs, the people are undisturbed; without interference, the people find ease. With such governance, what cannot be achieved? The \"always\" refers to never separating from non-affairs in guiding the people.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** \"To govern\" means to rule. One must always govern the world without interference, not with labor and agitation.\n\n**○ Rong said:** To govern the world, one must always act without interference. But when affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world. \"To govern\" means to harmonize—when forgotten, there is neither attachment nor abandonment; when applied, there is both suitability and unsuitability. If one governs the world through non-doing, there is nothing that cannot be harmonized. If one governs the world through affairs, there is nothing that can be harmonized.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** \"To govern\" means to harmonize and transform. It speaks of harmonizing and governing all under heaven, guiding them toward goodness through non-affairs and non-doing. Though responding to things with action, the heart remains untroubled—this is motion within stillness. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *Who is so exhausted that they make things into affairs?* When affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n**Imperial Note:** Affairs bring agitation; agitation brings exhaustion—thus, it is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** Affairs refer to oppressive decrees and dense legal nets—harsh orders disturb the people, while strict laws multiply punishments. The people grow restless, and the four quarters scatter. If one seeks to harmonize and transform, how could it not be difficult? Thus, when affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** When one favors affairs, governance becomes burdensome, and the people are unsettled—thus, it is insufficient to rule the world. \"To govern\" means to rule.\n\n**○ Rong’s Commentary:** \"To govern\" means to harmonize—when forgotten, there is neither attachment nor abandonment; when applied, there is both suitability and unsuitability. If one governs the world through non-doing, there is nothing that cannot be harmonized. If one governs the world through affairs, there is nothing that can be harmonized.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** When the heart is not yet empty and forgotten, treating affairs as affairs while being entangled in them—then affairs differ from non-affairs, non-affairs differ from affairs, motion diverges from stillness, and stillness contradicts motion. Such a person is unfit to harmonize and transform the world.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior text elucidates *immediate affairs as non-affairs*—though responding without attachment, it is thus followed by this chapter, revealing how the Sage, without a fixed heart, can still respond to stimuli.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:\n1. It clarifies that the Sage has no fixed heart, responding as stimuli arise.\n2. It shows the Sage’s benevolent salvation of the people, without abandonment.\n3. It reveals how beings are entangled in delusion, prompting the Sage’s compassion and pity.\n\n**First, it clarifies that the Sage has no fixed heart, responding as stimuli arise.**\n\nThe Great Sovereign rides the times, facing all directions to teach, while the True Lord governs the people, holding the celestial axis to bring peace. Their bellies full, all sing in harmony—without relying on imperial might. Unbuttoned, they savor themselves—how could they know the profound workings of heaven and earth? Ten thousand things move in unison, witnessing the overflowing transformation of the Zhou. The Eight Trigrams attend to affairs, measuring the pure winds of the age of Yao. Thus it is said: *The Sage has no fixed heart*, yet limbs and strength are fully exerted. Though chaos reigns, the seasons do not falter; though time shifts, the mysterious power sustains all. Opening a red heart to the world, the Sage seeks to transform people—aligning with the people’s hearts, how could it not be vast and boundless?\n\n**The Sage has no fixed heart; the Sage takes the people’s hearts as their own.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** The Sage’s heart responds to stimuli as they arise; responses arise from stimuli, hence no fixed heart. Though the heart is unfixed, it is always directed toward transforming goodness in the people.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** The Sage is empty and forgotten; stimuli arise, and responses follow. Responses must follow stimuli, and since stimuli vary, the heart has no fixed nature. Though unfixed, the intent is to save with compassion—for the people have untrustworthy and unvirtuous hearts, so the Sage blends their own heart with theirs to guide and transform them. Hence, it is said: *The Sage has no fixed heart.*\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** The Sage has no fixed heart—the Sage values adaptability and follows suit. They conform to what benefits the people.\n\n**○ Yan said:** The heart of no-heart is the master of the heart. For a single body, without the heart, danger becomes safety; with the heart, safety becomes peril. If the Sage above contains the transformation of virtue and power, and below encompasses the hearts of ten thousand people—whether things are great or small, they view the heart as their own body. Abandoning personal desires, they take what brings ease to others, achieving great harmony.\n\n**○ Rong said:** The ruler above has no attachment to action, trusting the people’s self-transformation. The Sage has no emotions to distinguish, responding to all things with resonance.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** The body of the Dao is concentrated and refined, the mind empty and free from thought—its stillness matches the boundless void. Thus, it has no heart.\n\nThe common folk are the myriad beings.\n\nYet, the Sage has no heart, but responds when touched—response follows the touch of things, hence taking the hearts of the myriad beings as their own. Though without a heart in response, they also do not reject what is not touched.\n\n**Second:** It shows how the Sage benefits all beings without abandonment.\nThose who are virtuous, I reward with virtue.\n**Yu’s Annotation:** Those who are virtuous, I reward with virtue; those who are not, I also reward with virtue—virtue as power.\nThose who are faithful, I reward with faith; those who are not, I also reward with faith—virtue as faith.\nFor those who desire virtue and faith, I thus reward them with virtue and faith.\nAs for the unfaithful, I also teach them with virtue and faith, so that the myriad beings may be moved by the Sage’s power of virtue and faith.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:** This is the meaning of response and resonance.\n*I* refers to the Sage.\nVirtuous means those who cultivate the Way with no desires—\n**Yu’s Commentary:** The Sage encourages their progress and fulfills their actions, leading them to the utmost virtue of *I reward with virtue*.\n**He Shang Gong said:** The myriad beings act virtuously, and the Sage rewards them accordingly.\n\n**Rong said:** Those who are virtuous, I reward with virtue; those who are not, I also reward with virtue—virtue attained.\nIf there were a heart to distinguish, there would be virtue and non-virtue, faith and non-faith—\none could not claim virtue attained.\nNow, since there is no heart to distinguish,\nnot only does virtue reward virtue,\nbut virtue also rewards non-virtue—\nvirtue rewarding all is thus called virtue attained.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Those who are virtuous, I reward with virtue; those who are not, I also reward with virtue—virtue attained.\nThe virtuous are those who cultivate the Way without desires;\nthe non-virtuous are those ensnared in the realm of action.\nThe Sage universally teaches with equal virtue and power,\nleading them to attain virtue—\nthis is the meaning of taking the myriad beings’ hearts as one’s own.\nThose who are not virtuous, I also reward with virtue—virtue as power.\n\n**Yu’s Annotation:** The non-virtuous are those steeped in habit and delusion,\nfaithful to error and opposing the Way—\nyet the Sage also draws them toward virtue with the Way’s power.\nVirtue as power means transforming them into the Sage’s virtue.\n\n**He Shang Gong said:** Though the myriad beings may have the non-virtuous,\nthe Sage transforms them to become virtuous.\n\nThose who are faithful, I reward with faith.\n**Yu’s Commentary:** Faithful means hearing the Dao and diligently practicing it,\nthe heart free from fixation—\nthe Sage responds with utmost sincerity,\npraising their virtue and leading them to profound faith.\n\n**He Shang Gong said:** The myriad beings are faithful,\nand the Sage rewards them accordingly.\n\n**Rong said:** Those who are faithful, I reward with faith;\nthose who are not, I also reward with faith—faith attained.\nFaith is compliance—\nsince things’ emotions may be compliant or not,\nand actions may be in accord or not,\none cannot claim all are compliant.\nNow, the Sage has neither compliance nor non-compliance,\nall are compliant—\nwithout compliance or non-compliance,\nall are in accord—\nthus it is called the great compliance.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Those who are faithful, I reward with faith;\nthose who are not, I also reward with faith—virtue as faith.\nFaithful means hearing the sutras with love and delight;\nunfaithful means not delighting in the Dao or hearing it.\nThe Sage acts with emptiness, compassion, and equal salvation,\nnot distinguishing between the faithful and the unfaithful,\nbut universally inspiring faith in all.\nThus, the Purple Cloud Lady said: Faith is the key to gain and loss.\nAgain, the scripture says: Faith is the pivot for learning the Dao.\n\n**Question:** The Sage has no heart, yet responds when touched—\nthey do not respond when not touched,\nand do not touch when not responded to—\nwhy then do they teach the faithful but not the unfaithful,\nyet now teach both the faithful and unfaithful alike?\nWhy also do they respond and resonate to both what is touched and what is not?\n\n**Answer:** Response may be universal or particular—\nlike treating the Dao in the Mysterious Capital of Jade,\nyet always saving the Three Realms—\nthis is universal response to those who are virtuous and faithful.\nAs for the barbarians, when touched by the Purple Qi’s Western Drift,\nthey receive the Dao’s teachings from Master Yin—\nthis is particular response.\nIf particular response, then it awaits particular touch;\nuniversal response is the ordinary compassionate illumination—\nthus the upper volume says: *Constantly benefiting all beings without abandoning any.*\n\n**Third:** It shows how beings are ensnared in delusion,\nand the Sage arises with compassion and faith.\nThose who are not faithful, I also reward with faith—virtue as faith.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:** The unfaithful are those stubborn and rebellious against the teachings—\nyet the Sage transforms them with equal and proper faith,\nleading them to abandon doubt and return to faith—\nthus it is called virtue as faith.\n\n**He Shang Gong said:** The myriad beings are unfaithful,\nand the Sage transforms them to become faithful.\n\nThe Sage is in the world,\nmixing the hearts of all beings with concern.\n**Yu’s Annotation:** The Sage governs the world with the Way,\ntransforming and guiding the myriad beings—\nconstantly mixing their hearts with concern,\nleading them to virtue and faith,\nwhile the Sage’s heart remains concentrated and still,\nits power illuminating with perfect clarity—\nmixing their hearts with concern,\nall for the world—\nthus it is said: *mixing the hearts of all beings.*\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:** This shows how the Sage blends with the myriad beings in their use of heart.\nMixing with concern means the Sage fears the myriad beings may not return to virtue and faith,\nthus mixing their hearts with concern.\nYet the Sage has no heart—\nwhat then is there to fear or rejoice?\nWhat is spoken of as mixing with concern\nis because the myriad beings in the world have not yet attained virtue and faith—\nthus the Sage blends with things,\nusing their hearts—\nhence it is said: *the Sage mixes the hearts of all beings.*\n\n**He Shang Gong said:** The Sage is in the world,\never vigilant with constant awe,\nnever daring to be arrogant in wealth or honor.\n\nMixing the hearts of all beings means\nthe Sage muddles the hearts of the myriad beings,\nas if they were dull and unenlightened.\n\n**Yan said:** Mixing with concern,\nlike vastness—\nspeaking of an empty heart embracing all directions.\n\n**Rong said:** Mixing with concern means not dwelling.\nAll emotional distinctions—\nseeing virtue or non-virtue,\nfaith or non-faith—\nthe Sage does not dwell,\nbut drifts along with each circumstance,\nmixing their hearts of distinction,\nequalizing their intentions of right and wrong.\n\n「○ **Chéng Shū** said: *Yīn-yīn* is the appearance of constant dread—speaking of the Sage who acts without clinging to responses, yet in the world, he spreads vast compassion, rescuing the common folk, fearing they may perish. Thus, he trembles with earnest vigilance.\n\nTo *mix the hearts of all beings* means *hún-hún-dùn-dùn*—without distinction. It speaks of how ordinary folk, bewildered by emotions and ensnared by phenomena, recklessly grasp or reject. The Sage seeks to muddle their hearts, erasing distinctions, and this very earnest dread is what is meant.\n\nThe common folk all *pour their ears and eyes*—\n**Yù Zhù:** The common folk, transformed by the Sage’s virtue, pour their ears and eyes to observe and listen to the Sage.\n\n**Yù Shū:** The common folk, moved by the Sage’s virtue to embrace goodness, look upward to his pure transformation and follow his example, thus all pour their ears and eyes to observe and listen, taking the Sage as their model.\n\n**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: *Pour* means *to use*. The common folk all use their ears and eyes as the Sage’s own vision and hearing.\n\n**Róng** said: The common folk cannot restrain their emotions with their nature, but instead indulge their hearts in desires, pouring their ears and eyes into sounds and colors, fixating their noses and mouths on fragrances and flavors. Thus, they fall into confusion and blindness. The Sage follows their afflictions to prescribe teachings, adapts to their circumstances to guide them, and transforms them through his own nature. He says, *“I alone remain like an infant or newborn, unaware of how sounds and colors delight the ears and eyes.”*\n\n**Chéng Shū** said: *Addiction* means entanglement and stagnation. Those lost in delusion drown in the world’s illusions, indulging their ears and eyes in colors and sounds. Drifting aimlessly, they wander without hope of return. The Sage pities their deep confusion and thus reveals their afflicted state. Among the six senses, he highlights two to emphasize how these two are the deepest roots of attachment. Hence, the *Xī Shēng Jīng* says: *“Ears and eyes, colors and sounds—oh, how you linger!”* By mentioning these two, all senses are implied, though the text is concise.\n\nThe Sage treats them all as infants.\n\n**Yù Zhù:** The Sage pities the common folk as a mother pities her children, thus viewing them all like infants.\n\n**Yù Shū:** Since the common folk pour their ears and eyes to observe the Sage, the Sage regards them as a mother regards her children, hence *“treats them all as infants.”* Another interpretation: The common folk possess discriminating hearts, but the Sage transforms them to goodness, making them like infants—without distinction.\n\n**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: The Sage loves and cares for the common folk like worms or infants, nurturing and raising them without expecting repayment.\n\n**Chéng Shū** said: All beings indulge recklessly in their ears and eyes, sinking into the river of desire. The Sage, with earnest dread and compassion, rescues them—his duty akin to that of a mother to her child. He pities their ignorance as one pities a helpless infant.\n\n*(End of Volume XIII of the Dao De Jing’s Mysterious Virtue, with the missing “then” restored from the Zhou Yi.

This is the chapter’s essence.\n**Imperial Explanation**: To understand **birth and death** is to transcend life’s clinging, thus **birth**.\nTo be ensnared by life and death is to be moved by death’s grasp, thus **death**. This is the chapter’s gateway.\n\n**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: **\"Birth\"** means desires arise from the Five **Viscera**, the soul steadies and the **spirit** rests—thus **birth**.\n**\"Death\"** means desires sink into the chest and mind, the **spirit** falters and is confused—thus **death**.\n\n**Lǐ Róng** said: From obscurity to clarity is called **birth**; from existence to nonexistence is called **death**.\n\n**Chéng Xuānyīng’s Commentary**: **\"Birth\"** is to transcend the Three Realms, to escape life and death.\n**\"Death\"** is to sink into the Three **Abysses**, to be drowned in birth and death.\nIf one comprehends the **Dao** of life and death,\nThey release **birth** by emerging from the **Ultimate Void**,\nAnd release **death** by returning existence to the **Ultimate Void**—\nThis is the **Dao** of **death**.\n\n**Thirteen types of life**,\n**Imperial Commentary**: Of the thirteen types of life, thirteen types of death—\nA broad discussion of all beings, those who live in harmony with life’s **Dao**,\nAnd those who die in accordance with death’s **Dao**.

It is because of their excessive attachment to life. The question is: Why do they fall into death’s **Dao**? It is because of their excessive attachment to this life.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: This poses the question of why sentient beings fall into death’s **Dao**.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: Why do they fall into death’s **Dao**?\n\n○ Róng said: Why is this so? It is because of their excessive attachment to life. How do they reach death’s **Dao**? They exhaust the **Dao** of their nine orifices (*jiǎo*), strain the **Dao** of their four limbs (*guān*), indulge in deeds that invite death (*sìyè*), and cherish a body that is impermanent (*wúcháng*). When their indulgence exceeds measure, they fall into death’s **Dao**.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: This is a hypothetical question answered in terms of life’s **Dao**. It is because of their excessive attachment to life.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: This is the direct answer, stating that sentient beings fall into death’s **Dao** because they are immersed in worldly deeds (*yǒuwéi*), drowned in emotional desires, and indulge excessively in self-nurturing to sustain this life. Their attachment to life is too deep, hence they fall into death’s **Dao**.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: The reason they fall into death’s **Dao** is that their pursuit of life’s affairs is too excessive, defying the **Dao** and harming Heaven (*lián tiān*), acting recklessly and losing proper conduct (*shī jì*).\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: It means they cannot embody the **Dao** and forget life, yet cling to life as something real (*shēng wéi yǒu*), amassing wealth and resources to sustain this life, and overindulging in its pursuit—thus they fall into death’s **Dao**. This sentence answers the previous question.\n\n**Third exposition on the virtuous cultivation of life**, where one is not harmed by the **Three Poisons** (*sāndú*).\nIndeed, those who cultivate life with virtue,\n○ **Imperial Commentary**: Those who cultivate life with virtue—when walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. The rhinoceros has no place to strike its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and the soldiers no place to wield their blades. Those who cultivate life with virtue have no intent to harm others, so when walking on land, they do not seek out rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Thus, tigers, rhinoceros, and soldiers also have no intent to harm them.\n\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: *Shè* means to guard. It refers to those who virtuously guard life with the **Dao**, perceiving its origin with profound insight. Originally pure and serene, they forget life itself in life, not letting emotional desires disrupt their harmony. They nourish their nature with emptiness and fluidity, and nothing can harm them—thus they are called virtuous guardians.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: *Shè* means to nurture.\n\n○ Róng said: Indeed, those who cultivate life with virtue—when walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Those who do not nurture their nature are internally harmed by emotional desires and externally harmed by venomous creatures. The virtuous cultivator of life does not indulge, their nature is unharmed, their heart is free from poison, and nothing can harm them.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: *Guāi* is an incomplete phrase; *wén* means to hear or perceive subtly. *Shè* means to guard and also to nurture. It speaks of those who virtuously guard and nurture life, embodying forgetfulness, emptiness, and tranquility, not lightly entangled by worldly influences. Their guarding and nurturing are revealed in what follows.\n\nWhen walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: The rhinoceros emerges from the Xiāng River to the south, is blackish-green in color. According to *Éryǎ*, it resembles a wild ox with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* (≈120 lbs). The virtuous cultivator of life does not stir harmful intent toward others, so when walking on land, they do not seek out rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battlefields, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Thus, rhinoceros, tigers, and soldiers also have no harmful intent toward them.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: When walking on land, they naturally avoid rhinoceros and tigers, and harm does not approach them. When entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers, for they do not delight in killing others.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: When walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers. *Lù* means flat ground. The rhinoceros is a venomous beast with one horn, resembling an ox, green in color. It states that the virtuous cultivators of life are not touched by venomous beasts. Internally, it means they reside peacefully, untouched by afflictions. When entering battle, they are not harmed by weapons. Internally, it means even amid worldly entanglements, they are not harmed by sensual passions.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to strike its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and the soldiers no place to wield their blades.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: Earlier, it was explained that the virtuous cultivators of life have no harmful intent within, so externally they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers. Here, it is shown that even if they meet such beasts or soldiers, the latter have no place to strike or harm. Thus, one knows that those who forget emotional attachments toward others can tame and befriend seagulls of the sea, domesticate and ride beasts of the land—how much more so would they avoid harm! Hence, there is no such harm.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: Those who nurture life, tigers and rhinoceros have no means to harm them, and blades have no way to strike.\n\n○ Róng said: It means nurturing life with the **Dao**, accumulating virtue through action. Earlier, it was shown that they do not meet evil; now it is shown that even if they meet it, they suffer no harm.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: *Zhù* means to stand; *cuò* means to set. The rhinoceros, upon encountering something, will charge with its horn—symbolizing ignorance (*chī*). The tiger is fierce and violent by nature—symbolizing anger (*zé*). Weapons are sharp and can harm others—symbolizing greed (*tān*). It states that those who cultivate life virtuously embody profound insight into true emptiness, so even amid the world, they are not harmed by the **Three Poisons**.\n\n**Fourth repetition of the question**, praising the virtues of those who cultivate life with mastery.»\n\n「Why then? **The Great Master’s annotation**: Why then? Because there is no place of death for them. Why then? Do rhinoceros, tiger, weapons, and armor have no room to strike? It is because they follow nature without selfishness, not treating death as death, so that things cannot harm their life—hence it is said there is no place of death for them.\n\n**The Great Master’s commentary**: This question inquires why the rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons do not harm others. By posing this question, it seeks to clarify the matter for people.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said**: Why do rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons not harm?\n\n**Róng said**: Why then? Because there is no place of death for them. The one who gives life to me is **God/Qi**, the one who kills me is my own mind. If I can extinguish the mind and still the thoughts, not entangle myself in activity, then there is no place of death.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation**: By posing this question, the reason becomes clear. Because there is no place of death for them.\n\n**The Great Master’s commentary**: This is the proper response. Those who see their own bodies as real are burdened by them; the deeper the attachment to life, the greater the power of death. Yet those who cultivate life virtuously perceive the **emptiness of dharma-nature (法性空)**, understanding that the body is merely a false appearance. Thus, they can forget life while in life, not err through excessive nurturing, and follow nature without selfishness—so there is no place of death to be found. Since the mind has no place of death, how can tiger, rhinoceros, or weapons harm their life?\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said**: Because they do not violate the **thirteen divine prohibitions (神营护之, 此物不敢害之)**, the **Dao/Way** protects them, and these creatures dare not harm them.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation**: Those who see their own bodies as real treat the body as a place of death. Now, those who cultivate life virtuously forget the false appearance of the body, and thus the body is without a body—there is no place of death. Since there is no place of death, where can the **Three Poisons** strike? This answers the earlier question’s intent.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One of the *Dào Shēng* (Dao of Life-Giving) section.**」\n\nThus, this chapter follows the previous one, which established that those who cultivate life virtuously can employ **emptiness and authenticity (虚假)**. Here, the meaning branches into four distinctions:\n\n1. **Illustrating the Dao/Way’s moral transformation and nurturing of the common people (黎元).**\n2. **Exhorting all beings to revere the Dao/Way and hold virtue/power in high esteem.**\n3. **Expounding the boundless compassion and transformative power of emptiness.**\n4. **Concluding with the profound virtue/power that benefits others while forgetting one’s own merit.**\n\n**First: Illustrating the Dao/Way’s moral transformation and nurturing of the common people.**\n\nThe forms of all living things, from the most base to the most refined, rely on the **cosmic breath (氤氲)** for their birth and the **subtle essence (妙)** for their spiritual dissemination. Though wisdom and folly differ, and noble and base forms vary, the great peng bird and the humble *yuan* (鴳) know not of distance, nor do the cicadas and crickets discern the seasons. The plum and willow bloom with fragrance in the moonlit night, while flowers and butterflies dazzle with their charm in the garden. What merit could compare to this natural function? The **Dao/Way** alone is constant.\n\nIt is like the great sea, containing all things, or like the heavens, covering all beneath. Within every flower and leaf, the **Dao/Way** resides.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** gives birth to them; **virtue/power** nurtures them.\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** *\"The Dao/Way gives birth to them\"* means the **Dao/Way** descends the harmonizing **qi**, refining all things so that each may live—thus, it is said the **Dao/Way** gives birth to them. The **Dao/Way** is called the **Mystic Source (妙本)**, for it is the origin of the **qi** that sustains all things, hence the name *Mystic Source*.\n\n*\"Virtue/power nurtures them\"*—**virtue/power** is what is **obtained (得)**, and **nurturing** is **cultivation (畜)**. All things obtain the **Dao/Way’s** function and are thereby nurtured; this is why it is said **virtue/power** nurtures them.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation:** The supreme **Dao/Way**, vast and mysterious, gives life to all things. The highest **virtue/power** is compassionate and sustaining, nurturing all beings—thus, it is said the **Dao/Way** gives birth, and **virtue/power** nurtures.\n\n**Form shapes them; circumstances complete them.**\n\n**御注 (Imperial Annotation) says:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth, **virtue/power** nurtures, and thus all things take form—hence, *\"form shapes them.\"* The *Yì Jīng (Book of Changes)·Xì Cí (Systematic Phrases)* states: *\"The Creative (乾) knows the Great Beginning; the Receptive (坤) completes the things.\"* Heaven and Earth provide form; above and below establish position—all these are the **Dao/Way’s** functions, entrusted to the Creative and Receptive for their operation.\n\n*\"Circumstances complete them\"* means that all things rely on the **Dao/Way’s** transformation of the seasons, the advantages of earth and sky, and the interplay of yin and yang to achieve their fulfillment—thus, *\"circumstances complete them.\"*\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** *\"Form shapes them\"* aligns with *\"the Creative knows, the Receptive completes, form and position are established.\"* *\"Circumstances complete them\"* refers to the **Dao/Way** giving birth and **virtue/power** nurturing, as all things take form. The Creative knows the Great Beginning; the Receptive completes the things. Heaven and Earth provide form; above and below establish position. The interplay of yin and yang fulfills them—thus, *\"circumstances complete them.\"* The forces of cold and heat each achieve their own completion.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** *\"Form shapes them\"*—this establishes the likeness of all things. *\"Circumstances complete them\"*—this fulfills all things with the forces of cold and heat.\n\n**Yán (严) says:** *\"Form shapes them\"* refers to the Creative knowing and the Receptive completing form and position. *\"Circumstances complete them\"* means the interplay of cold and heat, each achieving fulfillment.\n\n**Róng (荣) says:** The supreme **Dao/Way** moves without obstruction—what place cannot it reach? The profound **virtue/power** acts without stagnation—what matter cannot it accomplish?\n\nNow, considering their functions:\nWhen the **Dao/Way** gives birth, its principle returns to the **Dao/Way**.\nWhen **virtue/power** nurtures, its meaning lies in **virtue/power**.\nBirth and nurturing belong to things, and each thing takes form.\nOnce they sprout and their substance matures, birth and nurturing together achieve completion.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation:** *\"Form shapes them\"* refers to perceiving the **Dao/Way** and manifesting its substance—this elucidates *\"the Dao/Way gives birth.\"* *\"Circumstances complete them\"* speaks of guiding transformation through **virtue/power**, refining the spirit, and ensuring conduct becomes pure and accomplished—this elucidates *\"virtue/power nurtures.\"*\n\n**Second: Exhorting all beings to revere the Dao/Way and hold virtue/power in high esteem.**\n\nThus, all things without exception revere the **Dao/Way** and hold **virtue/power** in high esteem.\n\n**御注 (Imperial Annotation) says:** All things owe their birth and nurturing to **moral cultivation (道德)**, hence they revere and honor it. Since the **Dao/Way** has the function of giving birth and nurturing, all who cherish life naturally revere the **Dao/Way** and respect **virtue/power**. This exhorts all beings to uphold their roots and exalt the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe world’s honors and dignities are conferred by rulers alone, yet the **Dao/Way’s** eminence and **virtue/power’s** nobility arise solely from its function of giving birth and completing all things.\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** Since **moral cultivation** has the function of giving birth and nurturing, all who cherish life naturally revere the **Dao/Way** and respect **virtue/power**. This exhorts all beings to follow the teachings of their roots and exalt the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way’s** and **virtue/power’s** deeds are such that all things naturally hold them in reverence—this is their constant, spontaneous honor.\n\n**Yán (严) says:** All things owe their birth and nurturing to **moral cultivation**, hence they revere and honor it.\n\n**Róng (荣) says:** Parents give birth to us; heaven and earth shelter us—truly, they are worthy of reverence. Now, the **Dao/Way’s** and **virtue/power’s** blessings surpass those of parents, and their merits overshadow those of heaven and earth. By right, they should be held in highest esteem.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation:** The **Dao/Way’s** and **virtue/power’s** nurturing and sheltering are as described above. The people rely on them daily without knowing it, hence the exhortation to revere and hold them in high esteem.\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s** eminence and **virtue/power’s** nobility—none confer titles upon them, yet they are naturally revered.\n\n**御注 (Imperial Annotation) says:** The eminence of **moral cultivation** is not conferred by titles, but their function of giving birth and completing all things makes them naturally noble.\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** The honors of past ages were conferred by rulers alone, yet the **Dao/Way’s** eminence and **virtue/power’s** nobility arise solely from their function of giving birth and completing all things. Thus, all things naturally revere them—not by conferred titles, but by their inherent, spontaneous nobility.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way**, singular and unsummoned, naturally responds to all things like an echo to its sound.\n\n**Yán (严) says:** The eminence of **moral cultivation** is not conferred by titles, but their function of giving birth and completing all things makes them naturally noble.\n\n**○ Róng says:** When **moral cultivation** is emptied and forgotten, it naturally attains eminence and nobility—not by conferred titles, but only then does it earn reverence and esteem.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** The eminence and honor of the world must rely on rank and office, yet this is not enduring. But the eminence of **moral cultivation** and **virtue/power** is unrelated to titles, hence it is ever naturally so.\n\n**Third:** Broadly manifesting emptiness and universality, **palace of compassion** and **transformative birth**. Thus, the **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things and nurtures them.\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Increase and growth daily\" (增进日长).\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This concludes the initial chapter’s meaning of the **Dao/Way** giving birth. To begin is to give birth; to nourish is to raise.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way**’s relation to all things is not merely to give birth—it further fosters, matures, and nurtures them to perfection, preserving their nature and life. Likewise, a ruler governing state and self should act thus.\n\n**○ Yán says:** \"Giving birth and nurturing\" concludes the first two lines, with \"increase and growth daily\" as *rù* (抚, to nurture) and *yù* (育, to cultivate), *chén* (成, to perfect) as mutual aid, *shú* (熟, to mature) as completion, and *yǎng* (养, to nourish) as provision. *Fù* (覆, to shelter) is protection—these eight are the functions of **moral cultivation**, hence their eminence and nobility.\n\n**○ Róng says:** This broadly elucidates the **Dao/Way’s** function of giving birth and nurturing. \"Increase and growth daily,\" \"nurture and cultivate daily,\" \"establish and perfect daily,\" \"fulfill and mature daily,\" \"provide and nourish daily,\" \"clothe and shelter daily.\"\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** This reiterates prior text to introduce what follows. Yet it speaks only of the **Dao/Way** and not **virtue/power**, for **virtue/power** does not differ from the **Dao/Way**, though the text is concise. Thus, the *Xī Shēng Jīng* (《西升经》) states: **\"Moral cultivation** is a chaotic unity, profound and mysterious in harmony.\"\n\n**Long** (長) **them, nurture** (育) **them.**\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Nurture\" means to soothe and comfort.\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** \"Increase and growth daily\" is nurturing; \"soothe and comfort\" is cultivation.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** \"Long\" refers to fostering their virtuous sprouts; \"nurture\" refers to advancing their practice.\n\n**Perfect** (成) **them, mature** (熟) **them.**\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Perfect\" and \"mature\" are the same as \"nourish\" and \"shelter\"—thus, all revere the **Dao/Way** and hold **virtue/power** noble.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** \"Mutual aid\" is perfection; \"completion\" is maturation.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** With the supreme wondrous method, refining all things’ minds, the **Dao/Way’s** fruit is perfected, **virtue/power’s** practice refined—this is merely reiterating prior language to introduce what follows.\n\n**Nourish** (养) **them, shelter** (覆) **them.**\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** \"Provide and sustain daily\" is nourishment; \"shade and protect daily\" is shelter. These eight are the functions of **moral cultivation**, hence all things revere and hold it noble.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** \"Nourish\" means repaying their fruits; \"shelter\" means shading them with great compassion.\n\nThe above four pairs elucidate the **virtue/power’s** benefit to all things; the following three sentences reveal its capacity to transcend function.\n\n**Fourth:** Concluding the **profound virtue/power**, benefiting all while forgetting its own function.\n\n**Giving birth yet not possessing** (生而不有),\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Giving birth yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, fostering yet not ruling\"—this is called **profound virtue/power**, as fully explained in the *Zǎi Yīng Pò* chapter. That chapter speaks of human cultivation as the **Dao/Way**; this chapter clarifies the **Dao/Way’s** use aligning with humanity.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things, yet does not appear to possess what it generates, forgetting its generative function—concluding the **Dao/Way’s** generative meaning.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** generates all things yet takes nothing for itself—this is its beneficence.\n\n**○ Róng says:** \"Giving birth yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, fostering yet not ruling\"—this is **profound virtue/power**. Those who claim its function are not its true functionaries; those who rely on its **virtue/power** are not its great practitioners. Now, since it neither relies nor rules while giving birth and fostering, this is the deepest, most mysterious **virtue/power**.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Though it can generate all things, in truth there is nothing to generate. Like the straw dog of common sentiment, it is thus \"giving birth yet not possessing\"—having yet not having, generating yet not generating. This transcends the **Dao/Way’s** generative function.\n\n**Acting yet not relying** (為而不恃),\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** **Virtue/power’s** nurturing does not appear to act upon things; it does not rely on its function—concluding the **virtue/power’s** meaning of nurturing.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** may act, yet does not expect recompense.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Having generated and perfected all things, it possesses no claim to their birth. Applying laws and teachings, upon what may it rely? This transcends **virtue/power’s** nurturing function.\n\n**Fostering yet not ruling** (長而不宰),\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** With **moral cultivation** forgetting the functions of giving birth and nurturing, though it stands as the longest among all things—fostering, maturing, and perfecting them—it does not rule or demand recompense from them. This is said to urge rulers to model themselves after the **Dao/Way’s** generative nurturing while forgetting its function.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** fosters all things yet does not carve or dominate them for use.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Fostering the people’s lives, its function equals that of creation itself, yet both agent and recipient are illusory—who then rules? This transcends the four pairs of \"long,\" \"nurture,\" etc.\n\n**This is called profound virtue/power.**\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This is the praise of forgetting.\n\n**Profound** (玄) **is the name for what is deep and unfathomable.** Though the Great **Dao/Way** can generate and nurture, it ultimately neither relies nor rules. Its **virtue/power** is universally pervasive, yet its traces are not manifest—is this not the deepest, most unfathomable **virtue/power**?\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way’s** actions are profound and obscure, unseen.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** This refers to the preceding sentence and points to what follows. **Profound** is the name for what is deep and far-reaching; **virtue/power** is its protective manifestation, referring to those who embody the **Dao/Way**, benefit all while forgetting function, and follow the Sage—truly **profound virtue/power**.\n\n---\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of All Under Heaven**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounds on the **Dao/Way’s** capacity for transformation and benefiting all while forgetting its own function. Hence, this chapter reveals the **Dao/Way** as the **Origin-Mother**, urging all to cultivate it. Its meaning is divided into four parts:\n1. The **Dao/Way** as the **Origin-Mother**, exhorting all to begin cultivation.\n2. The method of cultivation and the mystery of closure.\n3. A general exposition of the paths of emptiness, existence, insight, and practice.\n4. The obscuring of traces and concealing of light to perpetuate the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**First, it is declared that the Dao/Way is the Origin-Mother, exhorting all to begin cultivation.**\n\nThe true principle is named for its **roundness and coldness**, while its wondrous root is called **void and permeating**—thus it nurtures all things as a child, gives birth to all forms as a mother, and responds to the world with **great authority**. It contains the void within its grasp, motionless and tranquil, yet able to wander at the dawn of things. In stillness and silence, it forgets all, returning to the root of the Dao/Way.\n\nConfucius composed his discourse, and yet he marveled as if struck by a dragon.\nZhuangzi perfected his words, yet he submerged his form like an ant.\n\nIf one **blocks the senses** and **shuts the gate**, laboring ceases for life—\nand thus one’s vitality is fully preserved.\n\n**The Origin of All Under Heaven is the Mother of All Under Heaven.**\n\n**御注:** *The Origin is the primal qi; this wondrous qi generates all things, possessing nurturing virtue, hence it can be the Mother of All Under Heaven.*\n**御疏:** *The Origin is the daily qi; the Mother is the daily nurturing. The Dao, through this primal qi, generates all things—just as a mother gives birth to her children, hence it is called the Mother of All Under Heaven.*\n\nThough the Origin-Mother differs from the Dao/Way’s qi, its transformation is ever unified.\nThus, the Classic above says:\n*\"Nameless, it is the Origin of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the Mother of all things.\"*\n\nThis is spoken to make one know the source and recognize the root,\nto guard the Mother while preserving the child.\n\n**River-Upper Master says:**\n*\"The Origin of All Under Heaven is the Dao/Way.\nThe Mother of All Under Heaven is the Dao/Way as the Mother of all things.\"*\n\n**Rong says:**\n*\"The Dao/Way is the root of things, hence it is called the Origin.\nIts virtue nurtures, hence it is called the Mother.\"*\n\n**成注:**\n*The Origin is the root of the Dao/Way;\nThe Mother is the trace of the Dao/Way.\nThe profound Dao/Way, the wondrous root,\nthe great source of wisdom—\ntranscending names and forms, beyond all colors and images—\nall things under Heaven arise from it.\nNow, speaking broadly of \"All Under Heaven,\" it is to make practitioners recognize the root and know the origin.\nThus, the Classic above says:\n*\"Nameless, it is the Origin of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n*\"The Mother of all things\"* means:\nFrom the root descending, guiding the masses,\nnurturing and raising them like a mother loves her child.\nThus, the Classic above says:\n*\"Named, it is the Mother of all things.\"*\nOnce the Mother is known, the child is understood.\n\n**御注:**\n*When all things obtain the primal qi’s nurturing,\nthey know their own bodies—\nthese are the children of the primal qi.*\n\n**御疏:**\n*When one obtains the harmonious qi,\nnurturing as the Mother,\none should know that the body is the child of the primal qi.*\n\n**River-Upper Master says:**\n*\"The child is the One.\"*\nHaving known the Dao/Way, one must also know the One.\n\n**Rong says:**\n*\"The Dao/Way’s virtue nurtures and sustains—\nthis is the meaning of Mother.\nThings arise from the Dao/Way—\nthe child is thus known.\"*\n\n**成注:**\n*The root gives rise to the trace;\nthe trace gives rise to things.\nHaving obtained the Dao/Way’s great compassion,\nwhich guides and receives the common folk—\nthis is my Mother.\nOnly then does one know that the body\nis the Dao/Way’s child,\nborn from the Dao/Way.*\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The void and natural is the true Parent-Mother.\"*\nHaving known the child, one must again guard the Mother—\nthen the body will not perish.\n\n**御注:**\n*Having known the body is the child of the primal qi,\none must guard this harmonious, wondrous qi,\npreventing its dispersal,\nthus preserving the body throughout life—\nthe body will then face no danger.*\n\n**御疏:**\n*Having known the body is the child of the Dao/Way’s qi,\nborn from the Dao/Way’s qi,\none must guard the Dao/Way’s purity,\nuntainted by delusion,\nnurturing the qi and preserving the spirit,\nso it does not scatter.\nHumans arise from the Dao/Way,\nand return to the Dao/Way.\nNow, instead of seeking the Dao/Way,\none must return and guard it—\nthus, \"guard the Mother again.\"\nTo preserve the body without peril means\nthat one can accumulate virtue in hidden and manifest deeds,\nharming no thing—\nhence, \"no peril.\"*\n\nThis clarifies that Mother and child guard each other,\nroot and branch gather—\nthose who practice this bring stability to their families and states.\n\n**成注:**\n*Having known oneself as the Dao/Way’s child,\none must return and guard the Mother.\nOnly by returning to the root and guarding the Mother,\nuniting with the Dao/Way and attaining the True,\ndoes one’s trace—whether existing or not—\nremain without peril or danger.\nFor the Dao/Way gives birth to things;\nthe Dao/Way is the root.\nThings arise from the Dao/Way;\nthings are the branches.\nSince the root can govern the branches,\none must return.\nSince the Mother gives birth to the child,\none must guard.\nGuarding the Mother ensures longevity;\nreturning to the root ensures the body’s preservation—\nhence the exhortation.*\n\nThe *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"Constantly nurturing the Mother,\nthe body will endure.\"*\n\n---\n**Second, it reveals the method of cultivation and the mystery of closure.**\n\n**Block the senses, shut the gate—**\nthen labor ceases for life.\n\n**御注:**\n*\"Senses\"* refers to delight.\nThe eyes delight in colors, the ears in sounds—\neach of the six senses has its delight.\nIf indulged, they bring affliction—\nthus, they must be blocked.\nNot indulging the six senses’ delights\ncloses the gate of calamity,\nso one’s life remains motionless and free of toil.\n\n**御疏:**\n*This expounds the practice of cutting desire and guarding the Mother.\n\"Senses\" means delight—\nthe ears and eyes delight in sounds and colors,\nthe nose and mouth in fragrances and flavors—\neach of the six senses has its delight.\n\"The gate\" refers to the passage of the senses and dust.\nBlocking the delights of sight and hearing\ncloses the gate of calamity.\nWith calamity extinguished and the gate shut,\none’s life requires no labor—\nhence, \"labor ceases for life.\"*\n\n**River-Upper Master says:**\n*\"Block the senses\"—\nthe senses are the eyes;\ndo not gaze wantonly.\n\"Shut the gate\"—\nthe gate is the mouth;\ndo not speak falsely.\"*\n\n「终身不救，人当开目视情欲，济事益情，则祸乱日增，终身难以救拔。○\n\n**Honor’s Saying:**\n*Those who stray from the Dao and are mired in worldly affairs,\nabandoning the Source to seek the branches,\nopen the six senses’ delights,\nunleash the five desires’ gates—\nthough they achieve what is burdened with names,\nthey forever lose the Way of *Wuwei*,\nand perish without hope of redemption.*\n\n○\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*When the foolish act thus,\nthey open the eyes and ears and other senses,\nindulging in colors, sounds, and other sensory pleasures,\nand throughout their lives they are ensnared by lust and debauchery.\nEven if the greatest sages and most compassionate beings exist,\nthey cannot save or deliver such individuals from their sight.*\n\n---\n\n**The Third Principle:** *To discern the subtle—this is called \"clear-sightedness.\"*\n**River-Upper Master’s Annotation:**\n*\"Subtle\"* refers to the sprouts of calamity before they manifest.\n*\"Clear-sightedness\"* is the solitary perception of such hidden changes.\n\n○\n\n**Honor’s Saying:**\n*Discerning the subtle is called \"clear-sightedness,\"\npracticing gentleness is called \"strength.\"*\n*When calamity first arises, it is subtle—\nthose who can foresee and prevent it are clear-sighted.*\n*Conforming to the Dao without resistance is gentleness,*\n*and those who remain steadfast in this are strong.*\n\n○\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Discern\"* means insightful observation.\n*\"Subtle\"* refers to the finest, most refined principles—\nthat is, the most profound truth.\nIf one can observe this subtle truth,\nwisdom and insight grow ever brighter,\nhence the saying: *\"Observe its subtlety.\"*\n\n*\"Practicing gentleness is called strength.\"*\n**River-Upper Master’s Annotation:**\n*To uphold gentleness and weakness*\n*is to become ever stronger and greater.*\n\n○\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Having discerned the subtle,\nwisdom and insight naturally increase.\nMoreover, if one can apply the Dao,\nmaintaining humility, modesty, and gentleness,\nthen one’s virtue and deeds grow ever stronger.*\n\n*At the outset of learning the Dao,\nthere are *dìng* (calm abiding) and *huì* (insight),\nthere is practice and understanding.\nDiscerning the subtle is the gateway to insight and understanding,\nwhile practicing gentleness is the unfolding of calm abiding and action.\nThus, among the Six Perfections,\nthe first five are actions,\nand the last is understanding—\nunderstanding is insight,\nwhile action encompasses both calm abiding and insight.\nTo guide the named through the empty,\nand to enrich the empty through the named,\none must clarify the interplay of these principles—\nhence the emphasis on \"practicing gentleness and discerning the subtle.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Fourth Principle:** *To obscure one’s traces and conceal one’s light,*\n*thus continuing the unchanging Dao.*\n*\"Employing one’s light,\"*\n*yet returning to its source—this is called \"clear-sightedness.\"*\n\n**Commentary of the Master:**\n\nTo perceive the subtle is to attain clarity,\nto cultivate gentleness is to grow in strength.\nIf one boasts of clarity and wields strength,\none will lose the essence of perceiving the subtle and guarding gentleness.\nThus, one must employ light outwardly,\nyet return to its source within—\nthen will one endure without affliction.\n\n**Exegesis of the Master:**\n\nLight radiates outward and is ever in motion,\nwhile clarity resides inward and remains ever still.\nThrough perceiving the subtle and guarding gentleness,\none attains strength without arrogance or force.\nThough light shines outward, it must return to inner clarity—\nthis is the transformation of perceiving the subtle and guarding gentleness,\nleading one to rest externally while returning internally.\nHence it is said: *return to its source within.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*Employing one’s light*—\nto use one’s vision outwardly,\nto discern the advantages and harms of the times.\n*Returning to its source*—\nto restore one’s luminosity inward,\nlest vital essence be dissipated.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nThe spirit moves outward—\nto employ light outwardly,\nwithout transgressing sustenance,\nwithout seeking excess.\nWhen held in low regard, one does not aspire to nobility;\nwhen impoverished, one does not covet wealth.\nThus, one returns to inner clarity,\nand the spirit’s luminosity is not exhausted.\n\nI enter the Dao, and the Dao enters me—\nI and the Dao merge as one.\nGuarding stillness to attain emptiness,\nI become the root of the Dao.\nNature’s responses unfold spontaneously.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nTo employ one’s light and return to its source\nis to avoid calamity for the body.\nWisdom illuminates the moment,\nusing light to avert disaster.\nTo perceive before manifestation,\npure and without loss,\nto reflect inward and return to clarity—\nthus, one suffers no harm,\nand the body incurs no misfortune.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nLight is the illumination of wisdom.\nHaving attained the unity of emptiness and action,\none’s wisdom shines upon all things.\nThough light is employed to illuminate,\nit is forgotten in its application—\nconcealing light, obscuring traces,\nreturning clarity to obscurity.\nHence it is said: *return to its source.*\n\nThe passage below states:\n*\"Shining without brilliance\"*—\nas in *Zhuangzi*, the doubt of sliding doubt,\nthe aspiration of the Sage.\nTo avoid calamity for the body\nis called *inheriting the constant.*\n\n**Commentary of the Master:**\n*遗 (yí)*—to bestow.\nTo return to inner clarity,\nthen one incurs no blame or harm upon the body.\nThus, it is said: *this is the secret practice of the constant Dao.*\n\n**Exegesis of the Master:**\n*遗 (yí)*—to bestow.\n*殃 (yāng)*—blame.\nThough light illuminates externally,\nit does not cling to objects;\nreturning to inner clarity,\none does not boast or display.\nGuarding the mother while abandoning the child,\nrestoring reflection to its source—\nthus, there is no blame or harm.\nThis is called *inheriting the constant*—\nsecret practice is called *inheriting*,\nas one discerns the subtle and wards off harm,\nguarding gentleness while containing clarity.\nSuch conduct is called *knowing the child while guarding the mother*,\nthe secret practice of the constant Dao.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nTo avoid calamity for the body—\nto reflect inward and preserve the spirit,\nlest there be leakage or loss.\nThis is called *inheriting the constant*—\nif one practices this, it is called *cultivating the constant Dao.*\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThus, *inheriting the constant*:\nto indulge emotions and extreme desires,\nto defy the root while following the branches—\nthen calamity and hardship arise,\nreturning to the impermanent.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nHaving known illumination and forgotten it,\nwith perfect virtue complete,\nall entanglements exhausted,\nno lingering harm or blame remains.\nIt is also said:\n*遗 (yí)*—to bestow—\nno further harm or provocation befalls the body.\nWith conduct perfected and entanglements exhausted,\nthe transmission of the lamp reaches its true inheritor—\ntruly, this person may be said to inherit the constant Dao,\nto uphold and glorify the true teaching.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 53: If I Were to Be Resolute in Knowledge**\n\n**Master’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage speaks:\nIf I were to be resolutely proud of my knowledge,\ndesiring to walk the Great Dao,\nsince my ways conflict with the Dao,\nall my actions would be cause for dread.\n\n**Exegesis of the Master:**\n*If I*—\nthe Sage’s hypothetical speech.\n*介然 (jièrán)*—proud and resolute,\nthe appearance of one who possesses knowledge.\nThe Dao is not a matter of knowing laws;\nyet if one, with knowledge, seeks to walk the Great Dao of non-action,\nthe Sage laments their delusion,\nfor knowledge clashes with the Dao,\nlosing the purity of non-action.\nThus, all their deeds would harm others—\ntruly, a cause for dread.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*If I were to be resolute in knowledge*—\n*介 (jiè)*—great.\nThe Sage deplores the rulers of his time,\nwho do not walk the Great Dao.\nHe posits:\nIf I were to be resolutely knowledgeable in governance,\nI would instead walk the Great Dao of non-action,\nabolishing the tyranny of authority.\n*唯施是畏*—\n*唯 (wéi)*—solely.\nSolely dreading that one’s actions\ndeviate from the Dao’s intent—\nto reward the virtuous, yet fear the rise of false virtue;\nto trust the loyal, yet fear the emergence of deceitful loyalty.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe Dao Master laments that rulers of his age do not follow the level path,\nbut tread the crooked ways instead—\nadorned in fine colors yet girded with sharp blades,\nsated with food yet hoarding wealth.\nFields lie fallow and barren,\ngranaries stand empty and void.\nThese are but men who boast of the Dao—\nhow could they know the purity of true practice?\n\nIf I were but slightly knowledgeable in governance,\nI would walk the Great Dao of non-action,\nnever straying onto the narrow paths of contrivance.\nIn all my deeds, I would most fear failing to uphold it.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"If I were\"*—this is a hypothetical speech.\n*\"Knowledge\"*—discrimination.\n*\"Slightly\"*—small and subtle.\nThe true Dao is supremely level and plain,\nyet if one were to stir even a slight thought of knowing and acting,\nthis would be to stir up false distinctions—\na movement that is deeply perilous.\n\nFor the Ultimate Dao is void and boundless,\ntranscending all distinctions.\nIt neither clings to falsity nor to truth,\nfor truth and falsity share the same essence,\nand life and death are one continuum.\nIt enters the nine abysses yet remains unobscured,\npasses through the three realms yet remains unilluminated,\nwalks through peril yet remains at ease,\nfaces great calamity yet knows no fear—\nthus, there is no dread.\n\nBut now, with thoughts and distinctions arising,\none strays from the original heart.\nAll deeds become steps toward ruin—\nthus, they are truly to be feared.\n\nThe Great Dao is supremely level,\nyet people love the crooked paths.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThe Great Dao is plain and easy,\nyet those with knowledge fear it—\nfor men, being prone to schemes,\nseek shortcuts, like travelers preferring winding trails.\nThe harms of such paths are detailed below.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\n*Level*—plain.\n*Paths*—crooked and swift.\nThe Great Dao is broad and unobstructed,\nyet people prefer crooked shortcuts.\nBut the Dao’s transformation lies in non-action—\nnon-action is plain and easy.\nYet those who govern instead\ncannot still their minds in desirelessness,\nbut labor their hearts to meet demands.\nThough they may initially seek shortcuts for speed,\nthey ultimately lose the Dao and disrupt harmony—\nhence, *\"people love the crooked paths.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Great Dao is supremely level—\n*level*—plain,\n*great*—easy.\nYet people love crooked paths—\n*paths*—crooked, not straight.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe true path is level and easy,\nthe crooked paths are treacherous and difficult.\nThose who govern often tread the difficult,\nwhile those who cultivate the self rarely follow the easy—\na rejection of the Dao’s way.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Level*—plain and just.\n*Paths*—crooked ways.\nThe ultimate truth is perfectly equal,\nwithout distinction.\nYet those who invert it,\nabandoning the straight for the crooked,\ncause the Great Dao to stagnate,\nwhile petty achievements blaze unchecked.\n\n---\n**Second, it clarifies that those without the Dao are gluttonous and greedy.**\n\n**The court is excessively adorned,**\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nIt prizes the clever and fosters deceitful ingenuity.\n*Adorned*—governed.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\n*Adorned*—governed.\nThose who love crooked paths do not uphold the transformation of non-action,\nbut take contrivance as governance.\nThough they claim to govern well,\ncontrivance breeds deceit—\nhence the annotation: *\"It prizes the clever and fosters deceitful ingenuity.\"*\n\nOr it may mean:\nThe court refines its structures—\ntall halls and carved walls—\nhence, *\"excessively adorned.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nHigh pavilions and grand palaces,\nelaborate halls and chambers.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe court is excessively adorned,\nfields lie utterly overgrown.\nCarved walls and towering halls—\ndemolishing the old to build the new—\nburdens the people, neglecting the tillage,\nwhile fertile lands grow wild.\nPursuing fame and gain,\nthey abandon the little for the much,\nneglecting the Dao’s cultivation,\nletting the elixir fields lie fallow.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nRulers who stray from the Dao\nlove crooked paths,\ndo not uphold simplicity,\nbut indulge in extravagance.\nThey demolish old halls to build new palaces,\ncarving beams and engraving pillars,\nexhausting all in ornate beauty.\n\n**Fields lie utterly overgrown,**\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nIdle consumption and laziness ruin agricultural work.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nGrass grows thick and fields lie abandoned,\nas idle consumption and deceitful labor\ncause agriculture to decay.\nWhen the harvest fails to yield,\nhow can one expect abundant stores?\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nAgricultural labor is neglected,\nplowing and tilling fall out of season.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nWith forced labor multiplying,\nfarmers abandon their fields,\nleaving the eastern slopes uncultivated,\nthe southern fields in ruin.\n\n**Granaries stand utterly empty.**\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThe southern fields yield no harvest,\nleaving no reserves.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nA bountiful year fills the granaries,\nbut neglected fields leave them empty—\na natural consequence.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe five grains are harmed,\nthe nation has no stores.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nA bountiful year fills the granaries,\nneglected fields leave them empty.\nLight governance leads to empty stores,\nvirtue fulfilled brings the Dao to fruition.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe harvest is limited,\nyet national expenses know no end—\nthe spinning wheels stand idle,\nthe granaries grow empty.\n\n**They wear fine embroidery,**\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nCarved and painted, embroidered and brocaded—\nharming artisans and profits.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nGreen and red form patterns,\nsilk threads create colors—\nvaluing ornament over substance.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThey love false adornment,\nprizing outward splendor.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThey wear fine embroidery,\ngird themselves with sharp blades—\nabandoning simplicity for ornament,\nvaluing force over culture.\nThose who cultivate the true way\ndo not inwardly possess virtue and the Dao,\nbut merely adorn themselves with ritual and bearing.\nTheir malicious intent remains unchecked—\nthey gird themselves with sharp blades.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThey wear fine embroidery,\ngird themselves with sharp blades,\ndisdain food and drink,\nadorn themselves with brocade and embroidery,\nguard their lives with keen blades,\nsavor wine and rich meats to refresh their palates—\nthey do not uphold supreme virtue,\nnor care for the people below.\nAlas, how gluttonous and greedy they are!\n\n**They gird themselves with sharp blades,**\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nSupreme virtue is not cultivated,\nyet military preparedness is prized.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nSharp blades are military preparedness.\nSupreme virtue is the instrument of governance,\nwhile military strength is its auxiliary—\nvirtue is the root, force the foam.\nIf one now prioritizes force,\nit is to abandon the root and exalt the secondary.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThey prize strength and extravagance.\n\n**They sicken of food and drink,**\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThey indulge in rich flavors—\n*厌* means gluttony, sated to excess.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\n*厌* means sated to excess.\nWhen the kitchen overflows with thick, rich fare,\nand they gorge themselves on fragrant delicacies,\nthe ruler lavishes upon himself costly provisions,\nwhile the people below suffer from hunger and cold.\n*厌饮食*, their wealth is abundant,\nyet their desires are insatiable,\nand they lack moderation in all things.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\n*厌饮食*, their wealth is abundant—\nYet true flavor lies in the harmony of simple sustenance,\nand the virtue of the Way.\nThe refined scholar finds joy in plain grains and humble fare,\nand scatters his wealth without greed,\nfor such is the treasure of the unselfish.\nThis is the balance of inner and outer perfection.\nBut to gorge on fragrant delicacies,\nto hoard pearls and jade—\nsuch is the conduct of thieves and boasters,\nnot the foundation of a noble realm.\n\n**Their wealth is abundant,**\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThey amass rare treasures and store excess goods.\n\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nWealth refers to coin, silk, pearls, and jade.\nTo hoard and accumulate deeply—\nthat is excess.\nThe shallow scholar may call non-greed a treasure,\nbut they only seek to pile up riches,\nto burden the foolish with their gluttony.\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nLight and reckless in their extravagance,\nthey debauch themselves in governance.\nThey impose heavy taxes upon the people,\nyet their hoards overflow with excess—\nthese are the third kind of men,\nthose who pervert the highest Dao.\nThey are called *qiá* (boasters) and thieves,\nfor they are not of the Way.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThey boast of their cleverness,\nyet their actions breed chaos—\ntheir deeds mirror thieves and boasters,\nyet they still pride themselves in excess.\n*Qiá* (boasters) and thieves are not of the Dao,\nand thus one sighs in lament.\n\n**The *yězāi* (also so) is a word of sorrow.**\n**Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nTo take without right is theft,\nto vaunt what one possesses is boasting.\nThey gather wealth from those who lack,\nand squander it upon their own desires,\nproudly indulging in their excess—\nto call them boasters and thieves is fitting.\nSuch conduct is not what I wish to uphold,\nand thus I sigh in lament.\n*The *yězāi* (also so) is a word of sorrow.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThey are boasters and thieves—\nwhen the people lack,\nyet the ruler has abundance,\nit is because they force labor upon the people\nto adorn themselves with fine garments,\nto parade in ostentation before others,\nunaware that death may come,\nand their homes be ruined,\nwith kin following them into ruin.\nThis is not the Dao, indeed—\nwhen the ruler acts thus,\nthis is not the Dao.\nAgain, *yězāi* (also so),\na word of deep sorrow.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nThe virtue/power and Dao are not achieved through cleverness and skill,\nyet they can transform the world,\nand give rise to the transformations of yin and yang.\nThe heavens and earth do not rely on cleverness and skill,\nyet they can embrace and release with endless change,\nand no thing can escape them.\nThey are simple yet profound,\nconcise yet effortless to follow,\neffortless yet perfectly accomplished,\nwithout action yet blessings arise.\nAh, it grieves me to see those who invert the Dao,\npursuing cleverness and skill,\nacting violently in the world,\nand thus clashing with the heavens.\nThis is not the Great Dao—\nhow could it not be a cause for deep sorrow?\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nTo take from those who lack—\nto hoard what is more than enough—\nthis is called theft.\nTo love adornment and excess—\nto boast in fine words—\nthis is the meaning of vaunting.\nOnly theft and vaunting,\nboth are contrary to the Dao.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nHeavy taxation and exactions,\nlike thieves and bandits.\nHaving amassed and stored wealth,\nyet still proud and boasting,\ncontrary to reason and subverting virtue—\nthis is called not the Dao.\n\nIf one acts as a practitioner of the Dao yet remains in ignorance,\ntheir fields grow overgrown—\ntheir heart is neglected.\nTheir granaries lie empty—\nthey lack virtue/power.\nTheir garments are adorned with fine colors—\nthey delight in empty words.\nThey wear sharp blades—\ntheir greedy heart is honed.\nThey weary of plain food—\nthey indulge in rich flavors.\nTheir goods overflow—\nthey hoard without giving.\n\n*The Daoist True Classic of Mysterious Virtue/Power—\nCommentary by Master Cheng, Volume Fourteen ends,*\n*Volume Fifteen begins.*\n\n「善建章」—**Chapter on the Foundation of Virtue/Power**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, for the prior chapter expounds upon those ensnared by greed and defilement, who stray from the norm and lose the Dao. Hence, this chapter clarifies those who harmonize with the Dao and align with the True, urging all to cultivate and practice, thus succeeding one another.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning is divided into three distinct teachings:\n1. To elucidate those who establish virtue/power, shining the Dao for future generations;\n2. To demonstrate how self-cultivation and benefiting others broadens their virtue/power;\n3. To measure the extent of gain and harm, thereby exhorting students of the Dao.\n\n**First: To elucidate those who establish virtue/power, shining the Dao for future generations.**\nThe Yellow Emperor, through his casting of the Tripod and ascending of the Dragon, established the Dao’s radiance.\nThe Huai King, with his elixir of immortality and mastery over cranes, ascended to the realm of the Purple Forbidden.\nIn the land of the Wondrous Milky Way, the myriad sages gathered at the Hall of Pure Jade.\nIn the Heaven of Verdant Clarity, the thousand True Ones convened at the Precious Tiles.\nHow did they attain such heights?\nThrough the **virtue/power** of establishing virtue/power.\n\nObserve Chen Zhi’s cultivation in his village—virtuous stars gathered afar—and hear of Duke Jing of Qi’s cultivation in his realm—Mars receded in flight.\nHe tasted the wine of the crossroads, finding harmony in its balance,\nand discarded his left-hand chariot horse to behold beauty in its purity.\nThe Zhou were called the \"Great Treasure’s descendants,\" ruling for eight hundred years,\nwhile the marketplace of Qi returned righteousness,\nits gates hosting three thousand guests.\nThe **virtue/power of the unshakable** is thus manifest.\n\nThose who establish virtue/power are **unshakable**.\n**Imperial Commentary:** The sage who can establish the Dao in governance and lay the foundation for the realm cannot be overthrown or uprooted.\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Establish* means to found. *Unshakable* means not to be toppled or uprooted.\nIt speaks of rulers who, through the Dao, establish their own conduct and the realm’s foundation.\nWhen the people do not act corruptly,\nand the myriad folk transform naturally,\nthen they refine them with sincerity,\nnurture them with noble customs,\nso that their laws inspire trust,\nand their governance is without end.\nThus, their achievements are profound and lasting,\nall under heaven returning to virtue/power.\nSuch is the **virtue/power of the unshakable**—how can they be overthrown?\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: *Establish* means to found. Those who establish their conduct and the realm through the Dao cannot be dragged away or uprooted.\n\n**Master Li Rong** said: Those who establish virtue/power are **unshakable**; those who embrace it are **unsevered**.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nIf one can establish conduct within the realm of the supreme Dao,\nthen their roots are deep and **unshakable**.\nIf one cultivates marvelous virtue/power within the domain of the Mysterious,\nthen their base is firm and **unsevered**.\n\nWhen governing a realm, their ancestral temples endure across generations,\nand when managing a family, their offerings rise unbroken.\nTheir teachings flow like shadows from the True Qi,\nand their legacy is sustained by the Mysterious Wind.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Establish* means to found. *Unshakable* means not to be toppled.\nThose who skillfully establish the Dao in their hearts and steady their resolve\nin the True Dao’s realm are **unshakable**.\n\nThose who embrace virtue/power are **unsevered**.\n**Imperial Commentary:** If one can embrace the Dao and virtue/power to govern the people, they cannot be separated from it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Embrace* means to uphold. *Unsevered* means not to depart.\nThose who embrace the Dao and virtue/power to govern the people—\nwhen they move, the people follow in delight—\nhow can they ever depart?\n\nMoreover, even delicious bait can retain a passing traveler,\nyet how much more so the Dao and virtue/power,\nwhich surpass this?\nTo wield them in governance,\nthe people will naturally return to them—\nthis is their proper course.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: Those who embrace the Dao to nurture their spirit\nwill never be dragged away or severed.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Embrace* means to hold fast. *Unsevered* means not to lose.\nThe prior sentence speaks of the initial resolve,\nthis of the enduring practice.\nIt says those who hold fast to the True Dao—\nonce obtained, forever retained—\nwill never falter.\n\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n**Imperial Commentary:** It speaks of those who establish and embrace the Dao and virtue/power,\nwhose merits extend to posterity,\nwho cherish their ancestral shade,\nand whose descendants are perpetually nourished.\n\nFor the king, the ancestors have merit,\nand the lineage has virtue.\nThus, the Zhou’s rise began with Hou Ji,\nand its completion lay with King Wen and King Wu.\nThe Zhou’s sacrifices included:\nthe ancestral rites to Hou Ji,\nthe lineage rites to King Wen.\nEven when divination predicted thirty-six generations,\nand a lifespan of seven hundred years,\nthe ancestral rites to Hou Ji and King Wen\nnever ceased—\nwhether the main temple was destroyed,\nor its streams overflowed beyond.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Sacrifices* means to offer. *Unceasing* means daily rites.\nIt refers to descendants perpetually offering rites to their ancestors and lineage.\n*Cease* means to stop.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: *Cease* means to cut off.\nIf one cultivates the Dao as such,\nthey attain longevity and immortality,\nand their sacrifices to ancestors and temples\nnever end across generations.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Cease* means to cut off.\nThose who embrace virtue/power align with principle.\nOnce they hold to this True practice,\nand transmit it to future generations,\nit is like the Primordial Beginning passing to the Highest Sage,\nor Xu Zhen imparting to Ge Xian.\nThe lineage of teachers and disciples continues,\nforever serving as the master of instruction—\nlike the unbroken transmission of a lamp’s flame.\n\nThus, the *Sutra of Western Ascension* says:\n*\"Learn from me, teach from me—\nnever lose the True Dao.\"*\n\n**Another Interpretation:** It speaks of those who establish virtue/power,\nwhose virtue is profound and lasting,\nwhose accumulated goodness brings blessings,\nand whose lineage flourishes eternally,\ntheir ancestral halls enduring forever.\n\n**Second: To demonstrate how self-cultivation and benefiting others broadens their virtue/power.**\nCultivate in one’s self,\nand their virtue/power becomes **True**.\n**Imperial Commentary:** Cultivating the Dao in one’s person,\ntheir virtue/power is **True** and pure.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Below, it clarifies that lesser cultivation yields lesser attainment,\nwhile greater learning brings greater reward.\nThus, *cultivate in one’s self* refers to cultivating within one’s own body,\n*cultivate in one’s family* refers to cultivating within one’s household.\nBeginning with the self,\nand ending with the world—\nthe pattern is clear.\n\nIt speaks of those who establish virtue/power,\nwhose **True Nature** is illuminated in purity,\nfree from all falsehood and impurity.\nWhen falsehood and impurity are exhausted,\ntheir virtue/power is **True** and pure.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s self—\nnurturing qi and spirit,\nextending life and years—\ntheir virtue/power is thus **True**, and they become True Ones.\n\n**Master Li Rong** said: Cultivate in one’s self,\nand their virtue/power is **True**.\nCultivate in one’s family,\nand their virtue/power has excess.\nCultivate in one’s village,\nand their virtue/power endures.\nCultivate in one’s realm,\nand their virtue/power flourishes.\nCultivate in the world,\nand their virtue/power is universal.\nThe Dao cannot be neglected in cultivation,\nnor virtue/power in establishment.\nTo establish virtue/power and cultivate the Dao—\nfrom the self to the family, to the realm—\nwherever they go, they bring stability.\n\nDeath and life have no fixed day of change—**True** when it reaches descendants, called *余* (excess).\nNear and far all find stability—**True** when it endures, called *长* (long).\nAll things self-sufficient—**True** when it flourishes, called *丰* (abundant).\nGrace without exclusion—**True** when it is universal, called *普* (universal).\n\n○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Former cultivation and practice—\nfirst refining one’s self,\nthen acting in harmony—\nvirtue/power becomes **True** and real.\nCultivate in one’s family,\nand their virtue/power has excess.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** When an entire family cultivates,\ntheir virtue/power overflows thus.\n\n○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** Cultivating the Dao in one’s family,\nsuperiors and inferiors in harmony—\nextending self-cultivation to the family,\nthus their virtue/power has excess,\nmeaning excess blessings.\nHence the *Yijing* says:\n*\"Families that accumulate goodness*\n*must have excess blessings.\"*\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s family,\nfathers are kind, sons are filial,\nelders are friendly, younger ones respectful,\nhusbands obedient, wives chaste—\ntheir virtue/power is thus,\nand excess blessings extend to future generations.\n\n○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Cultivating oneself alone is self-beneficial,\nillustrating self-interest.\nCultivating the family is mutual aid,\nillustrating benefiting others.\nTransforming one’s household,\nand ordering them to cultivate the Dao—\ntheir merit and practice gradually expand,\nthus it is called *excess*.\n\nIn ancient times, the Celestial Master cultivated,\nand his entire family attained immortality—\nroosters crowed in the heavens,\ndogs barked among the clouds.\n\nCultivate in one’s village,\nand their virtue/power endures.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** When an entire village cultivates,\ntheir virtue/power endures long.\n\n○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** According to the *Zhou Li*,\na village consists of 2,500 families.\nSpeaking of a village cultivating the Dao,\nrites and propriety flourish,\nsuperiors and inferiors are in order,\nneighbors respect one another,\nwithout favoring kin.\nOne family cultivating the Dao—\ntheir virtue/power is still limited.\nAn entire village cultivating—\nthen their virtue/power endures.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s village,\nhonoring the aged,\ncherishing the young,\nteaching the foolish and ignorant—\ntheir virtue/power is thus,\nand nothing is left uncovered.\n\n○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Cultivating the family and village,\nexpanding from narrow to broad,\ntheir transformative merit grows greater,\nand their virtue/power is superior and enduring.\n\nCultivate in one’s realm,\nand their virtue/power flourishes.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** When an entire realm cultivates,\ntheir virtue/power becomes abundant.\n\n○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** Cultivating the Dao in one’s realm,\ncustoms shift, winds change,\nreturning to simplicity and purity,\nnot favoring the near.\nA village cultivating the Dao—\nstill not yet universal.\nAn entire realm cultivating—\ntheir virtue/power becomes rich and full.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s realm,\nthen the ruler is trustworthy, ministers loyal,\nbenevolence and righteousness arise naturally,\nrites and music flourish spontaneously,\ngovernance is fair and impartial—\ntheir virtue/power is thus,\nand it is rich and full.\n\n○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: The five ranks of feudal lords,\nclearing their minds and cultivating the Dao,\nthus achieving peace within their domains,\nno worries within their borders—\nhow could they not be virtuous and sagely rulers,\nwith abundant virtue/power?\n\nCultivate in the world,\nand their virtue/power is universal.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** If the world cultivates entirely,\ntheir virtue/power spreads universally.\n\n○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** *普* (universal) means *遍* (pervasive).\nThe people’s loyalty lies in the ruler’s transformation.\nCultivating in the hall of state,\nvirtue flows beyond the seas—\nthis is because the ruler rectifies himself,\ntransforming without speech,\ngoverning without teaching.\nThe inferior responds to the superior,\nlike echoes answering sounds.\nVirtue is without exclusion,\nthus it is universal.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: When people cultivate the Dao in the world,\nthey transform without speech,\ngovern without teaching,\nthe inferior responds to the superior,\ntruthful as echoes to sounds.\nTheir virtue/power is thus,\nand it is universally vast.\n\n○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: The Sovereign of the Nine-and-Five [Emperor],\ngoverning through the Dao,\nserene and still, silent and tranquil,\nthe world attains great peace.\nThus all nations come to pay homage,\nthe four quarters submit in loyalty,\nhis blessings extend without limit—\nthus his virtue/power is universal.\n\nThe third category measures gain and loss\nto exhort those who study.\n\nThus, observe the self with the self—\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the self with the method of self-cultivation,\nand the truly pure is **True**.\n\n○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** *Observe* means *照察* (illuminate and examine).\nThe commentary says: Observe the self with the method of self-cultivation,\nand the truly pure is **True**—\nmeaning to observe the true nature of the self,\noriginally pure and undefiled,\nuntainted by dust,\ndiscarding all illusions.\nWhen illusions are abandoned,\nknowing emptiness is also emptiness,\nsuddenly uniting the two extremes,\nurgently aligning with the Middle Way—\nthis is truly pure and **True**.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Observe the cultivating self\nwith the uncultivated self—\nwho perishes, who survives?\n\n○ **Master Li Rong** said: Thus, observe the self with the self,\nthe family with the family,\nthe village with the village,\nthe realm with the realm,\nthe world with the world.\nThe source of the ultimate Dao\nis originally without good or evil.\nThe beginning of establishing virtue/power\nmust know right and wrong.\nThose who know wrong will not linger in evil long,\nthose who know right will rush toward goodness.\nDiscerning vice and virtue,\nilluminating survival and extinction—\nthe cultivating self returns to **True**,\nthe uncultivated enters falsehood.\nThe cultivating family has excess,\nthe uncultivated lacks.\nThe cultivating village endures long,\nthe uncultivated is brief.\nThe cultivating realm is abundant,\nthe uncultivated is poor.\nCultivating the world is universal,\nthe uncultivated is deficient.\n\n○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Thus, observe the self with the self,\nthe family with the family,\nthe village with the village,\nthe realm with the realm,\nthe world with the world—\nhow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\nEmperors Yao and Shun attained peace\nbecause they had the Dao.\nJie and Zhou were licentious and chaotic\nbecause they lacked the Dao.\nThus, observing the cultivating self with the uncultivating self,\nobserving the Dao-filled world with the Dao-less world—\neven the gains and losses of families and realms\ncan be clearly discerned.\n\nHence, the Old Master [Laozi] set forth:\n*\"How do I know the world’s successes and failures?*\n*Only by this standard,*\n*sufficient as a tortoise-shell mirror.\"*\n\nObserve the family with the family—\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the family with the method of family cultivation,\nand the harmonious have excess.\n\n○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** Observe the family with the method of family cultivation,\nand if family members are harmonious,\nthen blessings and fortune overflow.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank [He Shang Gong] said:** Observe the family that cultivates the Dao with the family that does not cultivate the Dao.\n\nObserve the village with the village,\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the village with the method of village cultivation, and those who follow order shall endure.\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** Apply this method of village cultivation to observe the village—when all villagers cultivate, with hierarchy in order, the transformative influence spreads, and virtue endures.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Observe the village that cultivates the Dao with the village that does not cultivate the Dao.\n\nObserve the realm with the realm,\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the realm with the method of realm cultivation, and those who are diligent and frugal shall flourish.\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** Observe the realm with the method of realm cultivation—when all its people cultivate, diligent and frugal, virtue becomes abundant.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Observe the realm that cultivates the Dao with the realm that does not cultivate the Dao.\n\nObserve the world with the world.\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the world with the world’s method, and those who act without action shall attain universality.\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** What is there left to observe when observing the world with the world? Simply observe oneself. When a sovereign is pure, acts without action, and establishes and embraces the Dao, the people naturally gather, and the realm’s longevity is assured.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Observe the sovereign who cultivates the Dao with the sovereign who does not cultivate the Dao.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this [standard].\n\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe oneself and others with this standard, and it shall be known.\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** This is a rhetorical question. The Old Master asks: How do I know that establishing and embracing the Dao leads to unshakable prosperity and enduring virtue? By observing oneself and others with this standard—from the self outward to the realm—it shall be known. Thus, the *Yijing* says: *\"Observe my life\"* and *\"Observe its life,\"* meaning one must first observe oneself before observing others.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** The Old Master speaks of how I know that those who cultivate the Dao prosper, while those who abandon it perish—by observing these five [aspects], it is known.\n\n○ **Honor [Rong] said:** How does one know that cultivators prosper and non-cultivators perish? Observe one body, and a hundred bodies may be known; observe one realm, and ten thousand realms become evident—how much more so the Three Dynasties?\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Chapter on Abundant Virtue**\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior elucidates cultivating the Dao for the benefit of others, embodying the Dao and uniting with the True. Thus, this chapter returns to describe such a person as one of abundant virtue.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning is divided into four parts:\n1. The infant as metaphor, showing the absence of the Three Poisons.\n2. The embodiment of the Dao in emptiness and forgetfulness, thus the Three Activities are pure.\n3. Praising the virtuous and abundant, knowing harmony and constancy.\n4. Contrasting those who cling to the mind, whose actions defy the Dao.\n\n---\n**First: The infant as metaphor, showing the absence of the Three Poisons.**\n\nThe Dao-heart is subtle, abundant virtue is profound—like the love for an infant.\nFirst, the account of Zhou Yu’s abandonment, the survival of Wu Tu, and the ancient saying of the Chu people.\nHis sinews and bones are frail, yet he holds harmonious *qi* without action,\nUnknowing of male and female, guarding the yielding and soft to fortify himself.\nUpright and detached from the world, carefree and beyond dust,\nHis form hides in humble dwellings, yet his mind soars above the blue clouds.\nCould he be like Yi You in declining office, or Guangcheng Zi in refusing the lord?\nHe hears thunder yet hears nothing, sees Tai Mountain yet sees nothing—\nHis eyes are closed in boundless freedom, his steps unconstrained.\nThis is the highest sage’s cultivation, the infant’s true attainment.\n\nAbundant virtue is like that of the infant.\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** The Perfect One who harbors profound virtue and the Dao is like the infant.\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** *Contain* means to harbor. The Perfect One, harboring deep virtue and the Dao, is internally protected by virtue and externally guarded by the numinous—like a mother’s care for her infant. This truth is difficult to grasp, hence the metaphor.\n\nThus, the infant’s wholeness and harmony are used to illustrate the Perfect One’s complete virtue.\nThe infant, the smallest of children, is taken as an example because within, there is no distinction, and no heart to harm others.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Abundant virtue refers to one who harbors profound virtue and the Dao, like the infant—divine protection surrounds those who contain virtue, as parents do for their child.\n\n○ **Honor [Rong] said:** Harboring the Dao and embracing virtue, accumulating deep and sincere actions, *qi* focused and unyielding, desires extinguished and without greed, the True Child undispersed—like the infant.\n\n○ **Citation of Cheng [成疏]:** Harboring virtue and the Dao is supremely pure; to illustrate this, the infant is compared.\nThe infant’s conduct is detailed below:\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not attack,\nHawks do not snatch.\n\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** The Perfect One is divine—harm cannot touch them. Since there is no heart to harm others, there is no ground for stinging or seizing. This is the Perfect One’s abundant virtue.\n\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** This elucidates the Perfect One’s complete virtue.\nPoisonous creatures: bees and wasps.\nFierce beasts: tigers and rhinos.\nHawks: falcons and sparrowhawks.\n*Sting*: using the tail’s venomous end.\n*Attack*: pressing with the feet.\n*Snatch*: seizing with claws.\nThe Perfect One’s virtue is complete within, harmonious *qi* overflows, the heart merges with the Dao—thus, venomous creatures cannot sting, fierce beasts cannot attack, and hawks cannot snatch. This arises from their utmost conformity to virtue’s depth.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Poisonous creatures do not sting—bees, wasps, snakes, and *qi* do not sting. Fierce beasts do not attack, hawks do not snatch—the infant harms no thing, and things harm no infant. Thus, in the Age of Great Peace, people of all ranks possess benevolence; creatures with barbs revert to their nature, and venomous beasts do not harm humans.\n\n「○ **Rong said:** When venomous creatures strike, it is called *sting* (螫); when fierce beasts press with their feet, it is called *attack* (据); when hawks seize with their claws, it is called *snatch* (搏). The reason infants cause no harm is twofold: first, they lack inner poisonous intent; second, their tender hearts are shielded by maternal kindness, so they are not injured.\n\nThose who embody *virtue/power* (德) neither possess malicious intent nor allow venomous creatures to unleash their venom, nor do fierce beasts find means to attack. This is because their hearts are pure and the Dao’s blessings descend to protect them.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** Venomous creatures refer to snakes and *qi*-beasts (虺). Hawks (获乌) include falcons and sparrowhawks (鹰鹯). Fierce beasts (猛兽) are rhinos and tigers (兕虎). *Sting* (螫) means to deploy venom. *Snatch* (搏) means to strike or grasp. Infants do not violate the realm of the *Dao* before them, hence they are not harmed by these three creatures—this illustrates how those who embody *virtue/power* transcend the three poisons (三毒) without obstruction.\n\nThe second passage explains how the *Dao* achieves emptiness and forgetfulness, thus purifying the three *actions* (三业). Their bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grasp is firm.\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** Weak bones and soft sinews yet firm grasp—before they comprehend the union of *yin* (雌/牝) and *yang* (雄/牡), their vital *qi* (□) surges unceasingly. This is the utmost refinement of *essence* (精), and they cry all day without hoarseness, achieving perfect harmony.\n\nInfants, though weak in bones and sinews, can clench their fists with unyielding strength. Before they know the interplay of *yin* and *yang*, the source of their vital *qi* (□) moves naturally, as pure as the essence itself. They cry ceaselessly from morning to night yet their voices remain unbroken—this is the peak of unspoiled harmony, the infant’s complete attunement.\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary (continued):** This section further elucidates the infant’s perfect harmony. Though their sinews and bones are frail, their grasp over objects is inexplicably firm—is this not due to their harmonious *qi* never dispersing?\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, with weak sinews and bones, yet grasp objects firmly, do so because their focus is unshaken and their hearts do not stray.\n\n○ **Rong said:** Infants’ firm grasp of their thumbs with weak sinews and bones is not from strength but from the concentration of their hearts. Though others may attempt to pry open their fists, they cannot. Those who embody *virtue/power* bend their bodies to conform to things and soften their hearts to follow the *Dao*. Though others may desire to sway them, they remain unopened—this is the natural preservation of *True Reality* (全真).\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** It speaks of infants with weak sinews and bones yet firm hands, likening those who embody *virtue/power* to beings of gentle nature, compliant and harmonious. Though they mingle with the world, their inner purity remains untouched—whether stained or not, they hold fast. This illustrates the purity of their *intentional actions* (意业).\n\nBefore they comprehend the union of *yin* (牝) and *yang* (牡), their vital *qi* (□) surges. Yuzhu’s commentary explains: *Yin* is the feminine (雌), *yang* is the masculine (雄), and □ refers to the source of life *qi*. Though infants do not yet understand the union of *yin* and *yang*, their vital *qi* (□) moves naturally—is this not from the utmost concentration of their *essence* (精)?\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, unaware of the union of male and female, yet their *yin* (阴) surges with anger—this arises from their abundance of *essence* (精).\n\n○ **Rong said:** The union of *yin* and *yang* (牝牡) is the convergence of *yin* and *yang* (阴阳). □ (作) means the infant’s *yin* (童儿阴) moves. *Anger* (怒) here means *stirring* (动). Though infants do not yet grasp the rites of male and female, their *yin* (阴) stirs—this is the utmost refinement of *essence* (精), which does not disperse. When *essence* scatters, the body withers; when the body withers, life ends.\n\nThose who embody *virtue/power* reject external passions yet cherish their *essence*, abandon laborious exertions and treasure their *qi*. They have no intent to stir, yet stirring does not disrupt their stillness. They empty themselves in stillness, yet stillness does not hinder their movement. Stillness does not impede movement—though they move, it is not true movement. Movement does not disrupt stillness—though they are still, it is not true stillness. Movement without hindering stillness is the utmost refinement of *essence*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** The *Zilin* (字林) states: □ (作) refers to the infant’s *yin* (小儿阴). It speaks of infants, newly born, not yet understanding the union of *yin* and *yang*, yet their *yin* (阴) constantly stirs—this is due to their *essence* and *qi* (精炁) being full and undispersed. Moreover, those who embody *virtue/power* and align with the *Dao*’s pure harmony, practicing *wuwei* (無為) and emptiness, yet still propagate teachings in the world, listening to sounds and seeing forms while intuitively grasping the truth of *emptiness* (真空), do not perceive the union of *yin* and *yang*—this is the utmost refinement of *essence*, illustrating the purity of their *physical actions* (身业).\n\nThey cry all day without hoarseness—this is the peak of harmony.\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** *Hoarseness* (嗄) means a voice broken by strain. Infants cry from dawn till dusk yet their voices remain unbroken—is this not from their harmonious *qi* being utterly pure?\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, from morning till evening, cry without their voices changing—this arises from their abundance of harmonious *qi*.\n\n○ **Rong said:** When crying reaches its extreme without sound, it is called *hoarseness* (嗄). Infants cry constantly from morning to night yet their voices do not grow hoarse—this is because their harmonious *qi* has not yet dispersed. Those who embody *virtue/power* expound profound truths without fatigue, and their teachings flow endlessly without cessation—this too is from their attunement to harmonious *qi*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** It speaks of infants crying all day without hoarseness—this is because they cry without intent, their harmonious *qi* undispersed. Those who embody *virtue/power* and intuitively grasp the *Dao*’s essence can thus speak of the unspeakable. Though they employ all things, they do not contradict the principle of *no speech* (無言)—this illustrates the purity of their *verbal actions* (口业).\n\nThe third passage praises the beauty of embodying *virtue/power*, knowing harmony and abiding in constancy.\n\nKnowing harmony is called *constancy* (常).\n○ **Yuzhu’s annotation:** To remain steadfast in harmony and gentleness, like an infant, is the practice of knowing *constancy* (常).\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** This concludes the infant’s attunement to utterly pure harmonious *qi*, which does not fail, as a lesson for others. If one can, like an infant, know the principle of harmony and gentleness, and practice it without deviation, this is called the practice of *True Constancy* (真常).\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** If one knows that the gentle and weak harmonious *qi* is beneficial, then they understand the *Dao*’s constancy.\n\n○ **Rong said:** Knowing harmony is called *constancy* (常); knowing *constancy* is called *clarity* (明). The loss of *essence* and depletion of *qi* leads to *non-constancy* (無常). To know harmony is to preserve *constancy* and avoid death. Those who embody *virtue/power* not only know the principle of harmony but also grasp the meaning of *constancy*—all things are illuminated, hence it is called *clarity*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** *Knowing this is non-speech*—those who do not speak are those who embody pure harmony’s principle. To know the *Dao*’s constancy is to abide in *True Constancy*’s path (真常之常道).」\n\n「Knowing *constancy* is called *clarity*. The Master’s annotation: To guard harmony and know *constancy* is to attain *clarity* and understanding.\n\nThe Master’s commentary: If one can embody *True Constancy*’s practice and preserve *essence* while cherishing *qi*, then they attain *clarity* and insight.\n\nThose who awaken to understanding know harmony and *constancy*, marveling at the beauty of shared *virtue/power*, yet further harm life by forcing *qi*. They commit the error of abandoning the *Dao* and instead magnify the faults of those who stray.\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: If one can embody the *Dao*’s *constancy*, then they daily attain *clarity* and insight into the profound mysteries.\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: To know *True Constancy*’s *Dao* is to attain wisdom that illuminates *clarity*.\n\n**The fourth couplet reveals the error of fixated intent, actions contrary to the *Dao*.**\nTo force *qi* for longevity is ill-fated.\nThe Master’s annotation: *Longevity* (祥) refers to auspicious or inauspicious omens. If one does not know how to guard *constancy* but instead seeks excessive *qi* for life, they invite ruin—this is inauspicious.\n\nThe Master’s commentary: *Longevity* (祥) refers to auspicious or inauspicious omens. If one cannot fully harmonize with *constancy* but instead cultivates *qi* beyond measure, they fail to realize that such excess only depletes *essence* and *qi* further. Thus, forcing *qi* for longevity is an inauspicious omen.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"Longevity arises from following Nature, yet do not force *qi* for life.\"*\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: *Longevity* (祥) means \"growth.\" To force *qi* for life is to seek endless growth, which is futile.\n\nRong said: *Forcing qi for longevity* (益生日祥) means the mind compels *qi* to grow stronger. *Longevity* (祥) is \"good,\" while *strong* (强) means \"excessive.\" This reveals those who follow worldly teachings and cannot emulate the infant’s natural grasp or embody the *virtue/power* of harmony. Those who claim to know harmony yet pursue *qi* through indulgence or medicinal means—seeking to make *qi* excessive and never decline, to maintain goodness without corruption—can they truly succeed?\n\nHence it is said: *\"All know what is good, yet none understand what is not good.\"*\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: *Longevity* (祥) means \"abundance.\" Ordinary people do not grasp the *Dao* of life and death, greedily clinging to worldly gains, and excessively forcing *qi* for life—thus their afflictions and hindrances grow ever broader day by day.\n\n*The mind compels qi to grow stronger.*\nThe Master’s annotation: The mind has distinctions of right and wrong, while *qi* has none. If one enslaves the mind to force *qi*, they become a person of excessive rigidity.\n\nThe Master’s commentary: The mind holds distinctions of right and wrong, yet *qi* itself does not. Thus, yielding to *qi* brings softness and weakness, while forcing the mind leads to rigidity and excess. Those who abandon the *Dao* and force *qi* for life enslave the mind to compel *qi*, making *qi* serve the mind’s will—this is excessive rigidity. Hence the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Do not listen with the mind, but listen with the *qi*.\"*\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: The mind should be singularly focused on harmony and softness, while the *qi* remains inwardly settled. Yet those who act recklessly disrupt this balance, and the harmonious *qi* departs from within, causing their form to grow rigid and strong day by day.\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: The mind is the *spirit* (神), and *qi* is the body (身). The world’s emotions are inverted, and confusion arises from mistaken perceptions. How could they know that all phenomena are empty, or recognize that the self is but an illusion? Once they enslave the *spirit* to command the body, driving it through ceaseless labor, their karmic bond to birth and death grows ever more potent.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they age—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* brings early decline.\nThe Master’s annotation: All things, when at their height, must decay. Thus it is warned: *\"To boast of strength and rely on vigor is to go against the *Dao*—this should be stopped early.\"*\n\nThe Master’s commentary: This reveals the error of excessive rigidity and deviation from the *Dao*. *Vigor* (壮) means \"unyielding strength,\" while *aging* (老) means \"decay and exhaustion.\" All things that flourish must decline, and when vigor reaches its extreme, aging follows. Those who use the mind to force *qi* and boast of their strength only hasten their own decay. To call this *not the Dao* is correct, for the *Dao* values softness and weakness, yet these people rely on rigidity—contrary to the *Dao*—and thus are urged to cease early.\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: *When things reach their peak, they age*—all things, when at their height, wither and grow old. *Not the Dao*—those who age cannot attain the *Dao*. *Not attaining the Dao brings early decline*—those who do not attain the *Dao* die early.\n\nRong said: *Things reach their peak, they reverse*—when vigor is at its extreme, decay follows. This is the eternal burden of worldly attachment; how could they comprehend the *Dao* of emptiness and tranquility?\n\nThe *Venerable Lord* (老君) laments that sentient beings have yet to awaken to *constancy*, to cherish *qi*, and instead cling to worldly actions that force *qi* for life. Such forcing only brings harm, as it contradicts supreme truth. Thus he warns: *\"Cease early.\"*\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: *When things reach their peak, they age*—this is called *not the Dao*. All things that flourish must decline, and when vigor reaches its extreme, aging follows. This proves that forcing *qi* for life only confirms *non-constancy*. Since it is *non-constancy*, it cannot be the true *Dao*. *Not the Dao brings early decline*—*decline* (已) means \"to stop.\" If one can awaken and recognize that *non-constancy* is not the true *Dao*, they should cease early and not indulge in false practices.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: \"The Silent Sage\"**\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous is that the prior one illuminated how the *virtue/power*-embodied one attains *constancy*, while forcing *qi* for life deviates from the *Dao*. Thus, this chapter follows, revealing how the *virtue/power*-embodied one forgets speech, while those who force *qi* cling to teachings.\n\nThis chapter unfolds in four distinct teachings:\n1. It reveals the supreme *Dao* as empty and tranquil, transcending all names and words;\n2. It reveals the cessation of the mind’s fixations and gradual cultivation through stages;\n3. It aligns with worldly confusion yet corresponds to the *Dao*’s natural unfolding;\n4. It reveals the profound insight of those who defy convention and follow the *Dao*’s path, thus attaining eminence.\n\n**1. The supreme *Dao* is empty and tranquil, beyond all names and words.**\nThe Creator acts through effortless, heartless self-motion.\nThe Sage embodies *virtue/power* to complete the Great.\nConfucius’ words, though three feet long, were not profound.\nThe *Venerable Lord*’s heart serves the people as its master.\n\nThe celestial path is distant, yet one hears only the clamor of roosters and dogs.\nThe journey is boundless, yet only the sound of pipes and drums is heard.\n\nThe form is indistinct, speech cannot be known—\nthus Zhang Hua, though attending to the *Dao*, found it exhausting,\nand Sun Lin, though speaking of *Zhuangzi*’s teachings, could not harmonize them.\n\nTo speak is to deviate from the *Dao*;\nto act is to lose *True Constancy*.\nLi Lou sought pearls yet dove deeper into darkness,\nwhile Yi You played with pills and freed himself.\n\nThe *Venerable Lord*’s instruction seals the mouth and closes the gate:\n*\"The Sage does not speak*—there is good reason for this.»\n\nThe Sage knows without speaking, yet the speaker knows not.\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**: Know, to perceive with enlightenment. Speak, to expound in words.\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**: The Sage, one who perceives with enlightenment. The speaker, one who expounds in words.\nThe subtlest truths are profound, the **Mysterious Origin** concealed in depth.\nThough words are used to elucidate the Way, the Way transcends all speech—\nthus the enlightened attain the truth yet forget the words,\nwhile the expounders cling to words yet fail to comprehend.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"The Sage knows without speaking, the speaker knows not.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\n*\"The Sage knows without speaking—\nhis worth lies in action, not in words.\nThe speaker knows not—\na horse cannot outrun its tongue;*\n*many words bring many calamities.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*\"The Sage knows without speaking—\nattaining the essence, he forgets all teaching.\nThe speaker knows not—\ntoo many words betray the Way,\nand clinging to doctrine loses True Constancy.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis** said:\n*\"The Sage knows without speaking—\nthose who grasp the Way,\nreach the subtle truths,\nand know the principles beyond words,\nthus they do not speak.\nHence *Zhuangzi* says:\n‘The Dao has no questions,\nquestions have no answers—\nthis is called *wuwei* [non-action].’\n\nThe speaker knows not—\nhe is ensnared by mere words,\nseeking truth in speech alone,\nyet the Way surpasses all linguistic symbols,\nthus he knows not.\nHence *Zhuangzi* says:\n‘Those who ask of the Dao and answer it,\ndo not comprehend the Dao.\nComprehending the Dao is the province of the Yellow Emperor.’*\n\n---\n\n**Third**, it clarifies that **True Constancy** has no attachment—\ngradually cultivating, step by step.\nSeal its **mouth** [兑], close its **gate** [门].\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**: Seal its **mouth**—\nthe enlightened, regarding the law, harbor no affection or clinging,\nthus it is said to seal its **mouth**.\nClose its **gate**—\nonce free from affection,\nthe door of craving for praise is shut.\n\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:\nAs explained in the chapter *\"The Beginning of the World\"*, yet here it is concisely stated:\nto seal the six senses from love and desire,\nto close the door of speech and doctrine,\nand thus to ease the burden of clinging words.\n\nTo have no attachment to words,\nthus it is said to seal its **mouth**—\nnot being swayed by praise or blame,\nthis is called closing its **gate**.\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\n*\"To seal and close is to cut off its source.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*\"To block the path of desire,\nand sever the root of calamity.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis** said:\n*\"Seal its **mouth**—\nto silence speech and argument.\nClose its **gate**—\nto restrain the six emotions.\nDull its sharpness,\nresolve its chaos,\nsoften its brilliance,\nblend with the dust.*\n\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**:\nAs explained in the chapter *\"The Overflowing of the Dao\"*,\nyet here it is applied to human conduct.\nTo say one can embody the Dao,\nthis is called harmonizing with the **Mysterious Origin**’s virtue.\n\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:\nThese four lines already appear in the upper passage of the *\"Overflowing of the Dao\"* chapter,\nyet there it discusses the Dao’s function,\nwhile here it illustrates human practice.\nThe two passages together,\nrepeating these lines,\nemphasize the Dao’s role in benefiting others and perfecting oneself.\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\n*\"Dull its sharpness—\nwhen desire and emotion grow sharp,\none should reflect on the Dao’s non-action to temper them.\nResolve its chaos—\nwhen anger and grudges swirl without end,\none should reflect on the Dao’s tranquility to dispel them.\nSoften its brilliance—\nthough one may possess singular insight,\none should blend it with the dim,\nso as not to dazzle others.\nBlend with the dust—\none should not stand apart as unique.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*\"Dull its sharpness, resolve its chaos—\nto blunt the edge of greed,\nand to release the tangled disputes of right and wrong.\nSoften its brilliance, blend with the dust—\nthis is called harmonizing with the **Mysterious Origin**,\nfor in the contest of gain and loss,\none may succeed or fail,\nand in the rivalry of right and wrong,\nthere is only one side or the other.\nNow, to soften brilliance is to share in wisdom without distinction,\nand to blend with the dust is to unite in folly without separation,\nto traverse all things in equal measure—\nwhat law could then divide us?\"*\n\n**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis**:\n*\"Dull its sharpness—\nto curb greed and rivalry.\nResolve its chaos—\nto release resentment and forgiveness.\nSoften its brilliance—\nto accommodate the vulgar and unlearned.\nBlend with the dust—\nto merge with worldly affairs.\nThe preceding lines have already been fully elucidated;\nnow they are simply reiterated without further expounding.\nThey are repeated because these lines are most pertinent to study and inquiry.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Fourth**, it explains blending with the dust and obscuring one’s traces,\nthus aligning with the Way—\nthis is called **harmonizing with the Mysterious Origin**.\n\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:\nIt praises those who embody the Dao—\nnot clinging to words or doctrine,\nand blending their brilliance with the common,\ntheir conduct in resonance with the Way—\nthis is called **harmonizing with the Mysterious Origin**’s virtue.\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\n*\"Mysterious, the heavens.\nIf one can practice these matters above,\nit is called aligning with the heavenly Dao.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis** said:\n*\"Having first severed attachment to self,\nthen blending brilliance and obscuring traces,\none’s virtue is full and complete,\nthus their conduct aligns with the **Mysterious Origin**’s principles.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Fifth**, it reveals the Sage’s profound understanding of yielding and compliance,\nthus his exalted dignity.\nHence, he cannot be approached with familiarity,\nnor distanced with coldness.\n\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**:\n*\"Hence, he cannot be approached with familiarity—\nthe **Mysterious Origin**’s harmony knows no partiality,\nthus he cannot be approached with familiarity.\nHe cannot be distanced with coldness—\nhis boundless blending with all,\nthus he cannot be distanced with coldness.\"*\n\n*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:\n*\"The Sage who harmonizes with the **Mysterious Origin**,\nwhose heart holds no bias,\ncannot be approached with familiarity,\nnor treated with levity.\nHe blends his brilliance and follows things,\ncannot be distanced with coldness,\nnor held at arm’s length.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\n*\"Hence, he cannot be approached with familiarity—\nhe does not take pleasure in honor and fame,\nnor sorrow in solitude.\nHe cannot be distanced with coldness—\nhis mind is tranquil, his desires stilled,\nhe bears no grudge against others.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*\"Hence, he cannot be approached with familiarity,\nnor distanced with coldness,\nnor drawn by profit,\nnor hindered by harm,\nnor elevated by nobility,\nnor diminished by lowliness—\nthus he is noble in the world.\nFor near and far bring distinctions of familiarity and distance,\nand holding onto gain and loss spawns profit and harm,\nwhile fixing rank and status solidifies nobility and lowliness.\nNow, having resolved chaos and dulled sharpness,\nblended brilliance and united with the dust,\nhis love and hate are equal,\nfamiliarity and distance cannot penetrate him,\npraise and blame are the same,\nprofit and harm cannot interfere,\nhonor and disgrace are forgotten—\nnobility and lowliness cannot be attained.\nThose who can practice this,\nmay be called noble in the world.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"The Dao aligns with the Profound Mystery,\nwhile perception transcends duality—\nboth subject and object forgotten,\nand yet one gaze encompasses near and far.\nHe cannot be exploited for gain,\nnor harmed by conflict.\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*'Cannot be exploited for gain'—\nfor without desire, gain cannot be seized.\n'Cannot be harmed by conflict'—\nfor without strife, harm cannot be inflicted.*\n\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\n*In tranquil simplicity, none can lure him with profit,\nand dwelling in non-competition, none can provoke him to harm.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*'Cannot be exploited for gain'—\nhis body does not crave wealth and rank,\nhis palate does not indulge in the five flavors.\nNor can he be harmed—\nhe does not contend with the greedy for profit,\nnor does he clash with the bold for vigor.*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Gain and harm are but matters of life and death.\nTo him, life and death bring no change—\nhow much less profit and loss!\nThus the *Zhuangzi* says:\n*'He does not pursue gain,\nnor shun harm.'*\n\nHe cannot be ennobled,\nnor debased.\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*'Cannot be ennobled'—\nembodying the Dao naturally, he cannot be forced into nobility.\n'Cannot be debased'—\npure as washed jade, he cannot be sullied.*\n\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\n*Embodying the Dao naturally,\nhe is not adorned by rank or office,\ntranscending entanglements,\nbeyond the reach of common defilement.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*'Cannot be ennobled'—\nhe does not rule in chaotic times,\nnor occupy a tyrant’s throne.\nNor can he be debased—\nhe does not grow arrogant from power,\nnor bow from broken resolve.*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Nobility and lowliness are but matters of praise and blame—\nthus slander and acclaim move him not,\nhonor and disgrace stir him not.\nHence, nobility and lowliness cannot touch his heart.\nThus, he is noble in the world.*\n\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*His essence is unobstructed, his speech unconstrained,\nall sharpness dissolved, brilliance blended with dust—\nnear and far cannot reach him,\nnobility and lowliness cannot be imposed.*\n\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\n*Those who merge with the Profound Mystery\nawaken to truth beyond words,\nseal their senses, close their gates,\nuntainted by roots or dust.\nWith all sharpness dissolved and brilliance obscured,\ntheir conduct is thus—\nand so the world reveres them as noble.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*His virtue is such that\nemperors cannot make him a subject,\nlords cannot bend him—\nhe drifts with the world’s tides,\npreserving himself while avoiding harm.\nThus, he is noble in the world.*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Having cast off distinctions of near and far,\nand forgotten gain and loss,\npraise and blame do not enter his mind,\nnobility and lowliness do not weigh on his heart.\nThus, the common folk bear him aloft without complaint,\nall ranks extol him without exhaustion—\nand so the world between heaven and earth honors and esteems him.*\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with the Dao**\n*(This chapter follows the previous one,\nwhich illuminated those who embody the Dao as the world’s most noble—\nnow it demonstrates how such sages govern,\nto show the method of ruling and transforming.)*\n\nThe chapter unfolds in four distinct sections:\n1. **Discerning the two wisdoms—power and reality—and their differing applications.**\n2. **Nurturing the people without first creating disorder.**\n3. **Addressing doubts through hypothetical questions to expound on action.**\n4. **Citing sages to reveal the beauty of non-action.**\n\n---\n**1. Discerning the two wisdoms—power and reality—and their differing applications.**\n\n*The Dao is the hidden essence of all things,\nwhile war is the toil of the people.\nThus, the sage-kings of antiquity melted down weapons\nto forge farming tools.\nLater ages, lost in delusion, wielded axes and halberds\nas instruments of threat and punishment.\nHence, war relies on deceit and surprise,\nwhile the Dao rests in profound silence.\nThe man of empty heart and full belly\nretires like Ziyin to the recluses of Huan Liang,\nwhile the ambitious, reckless warrior\nmeets his end like Nie Zheng at the hands of the Chancellor of Qin—\none is ridiculed as a flayed fool across the world,\nthe other revered as a model of loyalty in the age.\nWith rulers abounding in taboos,\nthe people grow impoverished,\nand strange devices multiply,\nonly breeding more thieves and bandits.\n\nThe sage does nothing, yet all things find rest.\nThe man who harbors the Dao must know this truth.*\n\n---\n**Governing with the Dao,**\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*'Governing with the Dao'—\nusing deceit in war,\nusing non-action to win the world.\n*'Win' here means to harmonize.\nTo rule the world, the highest virtue is non-action.\nIf one governs through laws and policies,\nor wages war with deceit,\nthese are all misalignments.\nOnly non-action and non-governing can win the world.*\n\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\n*Here is the heading.\n*'With' means 'by means of.'\n*'Politics' refers to governance and education.\nIt says that a ruler who acts will boast of his policies,\nyet cannot achieve non-action,\nand cannot let things transform naturally.\nTo seek governance through policies—\nthis has never been heard before.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*'With' means 'to attain.'\nHeaven appoints those who rectify themselves\nto rectify the realm.*\n\n**Master Yan** said:\n*Striving to govern with public-minded thought\nis not as good as governing without thought at all.\nTo forbid excess by desire\nis not as good as attaining loyalty through no desire.\nTo grasp the strategies of Huangdi and Taigong,\nand wield the essentials of Sunzi and Wuqi,\nis not as good as letting the world abandon schemes of cunning.*\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*Nurturing the people lies in balance,\nspreading virtue in governance lies in rectitude.\nThis is what is meant by:\n*'The feudal lords and ministers cultivate morality,\nharmonizing rites and culture in education.'*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*'With' means 'by means of.'\n*'Politics' refers to named laws and statutes.\n*'Govern' means to regulate and order.\nThe sage, ruling the world,\nadapts to circumstances in dealing with people,\nemploying the Dao’s power in war,\nand applying practical wisdom in governance—\nthis is the time to lay down arms and cultivate culture,\nto use substantive governance.*\n\n---\n**Using deceit in war,**\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\n*This is also a heading.\n*'Deceit' means stratagem and trickery.\nUnauspicious tools—\nthe virtuous man already abhors them.\nHow much more so when paired with deceitful names\nand unrestrained application!\nThus, war is like fire—\nif not controlled, it will consume itself.\nHence, it is known that deceitful warfare\nis not the path to victory.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*'Deceit' means 'trickery.'*\n\nThe Celestial employs deceitful and false men\nto wield arms.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*‘Deceit’ means stratagem and trickery—\nin times of crisis, one must adapt with cunning.\nWar knows no surfeit of deceit:\nthe *Three Stratagems* are most cunning,\nthe *Nine Battles* ensure victory a hundred times.\nThe supreme general pacifies strife and quells rebels—\nthis is the martial virtue’s achievement.*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*‘Deceit’ means guile and trickery.\nTo subdue chaos and restore order,\none must wield arms—\nwar knows no surfeit of deceit,\nrequiring guile and cunning.\nThus, it is the age of abandoning culture for martial prowess,\nof employing expedient power.*\n\nSecondly, to govern the people,\nnothing surpasses *wu shi* [non-action].\nTo attain the realm through *wu shi*.\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\n*This is also a heading.\nThe sagely ruler acts without action yet brings order—\nto act without action is to have no affairs,\nto have no affairs is to avoid exertion,\nto avoid exertion is for the people to self-transform,\nand thus the realm attains great peace.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*To employ those who act without action,\nto rule the realm as its sovereign.*\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*The enlightened ruler governs the realm:\nwhen expounding the Dao and propagating virtue,\nhe has worthy ministers;\nwhen upholding principles and punishing rebellion,\nhe has renowned generals.\nSeated in majesty among the myriad states,\nhis ears sealed, his spirit concentrated in the highest halls.*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*The Way of culture and martial arts adapts to circumstances and times—\nlike the linked huts of a military encampment,\nwhich rely on straw dogs for sacrifice:\nto grasp them tightly only worsens their decay.\nBetter to act without action, concentrate the spirit within the *Gushaji* [mythical realm],\nneither martial nor cultural,\nto rule from the ancestral hall with passive governance,\nthus transforming all things—\nno flaws or ailments remain.\nTo govern the people in this way,\nthey sing and strike the earth in joy.\nThe subtlety of this governance lies here.*\n\nThirdly, posing doubts and widely debating *youwei* [action].\n*How do I know this is so?*\n\n「以此。\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage Master, in his questioning, inquires: *\"How do I know that to govern the world must be without action and without affairs?\"*\nBy observing the following lines, one may verify: *\"The more prohibitions there are, the poorer the people grow.\"* I, without action, let the people transform themselves naturally—\nthus it is proven.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"This\"* refers to *\"today.\"* The Master Lao speaks of how I know the will of Heaven,\nby what is seen in today’s affairs.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\n*\"How do one know that without affairs one can govern the world?\"*\nBy these lines below: *\"I, without affairs, let the people enrich themselves naturally.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage Master’s teaching poses this question:\n*\"How do I know that to transform and govern the world must be without affairs?\"*\nBy examining the lines that follow, one understands.\nThe world abounds with prohibitions and taboos,\nyet the people grow ever poorer.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWhen governing with laws and decrees,\nprohibitions multiply—\npeople lose their means of livelihood,\nthus they grow ever poorer.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"The world\"* refers to the sovereign.\n*\"Prohibitions\"* mean restrictions.\nIf the sovereign indulges in excessive restrictions,\ndeceit arises within the people.\nIf prohibitions are many,\nthe lower ranks resort to trickery,\nand deceit spreads among them—\nthus poverty ensues.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nProhibitions are manifold,\nlaws and decrees form a dense net—\nthe net ensnares, the people labor,\nits strictness instills fear—\nhow can they not grow poor,\nwhen laws obstruct their livelihood?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Prohibitions\"* are akin to *\"restrictions and punishments.\"*\nHarsh laws and punishments ensnare many,\nthe people dare not pursue their livelihoods—\nthus they grow ever poorer.\nThose who govern themselves cannot follow their true nature,\nbut cling rigidly to restrictions and taboos,\nlacking inner virtue—\nthus they grow ever poorer.\nThis sentence elucidates governance through laws.\n\nThe people abound with sharp implements,\nyet the state grows ever more chaotic.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Sharp implements\"* refer to *\"stratagems and deceits.\"*\nIf the sovereign relies excessively on stratagems and deceits,\nand cannot discern true simplicity,\nthen the lower ranks will respond in kind with cunning and guile—\nthus the state grows ever more chaotic and disordered.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Sharp implements\"* are stratagems.\nIf the people are steeped in stratagems,\ntheir vision is dazzled, their hearing bewildered—\nsuperior and inferior grow estranged,\nthus the state falls into chaos.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nStratagems and power should not be given in excess to the people,\nweapons should not be common in every household—\nif weapons are common, people will think of rebellion,\nif many hold power, fear of disorder arises.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Sharp implements\"* means *\"weapons of war.\"*\n*\"Hastening\"* means *\"excessive.\"*\nIn an age of chaos and disorder,\nculture and virtue are neglected,\nonly warfare is pursued—\nas injuries and devastation multiply,\nthe chaos deepens daily.\nThose who govern themselves sharpen their desires,\ntheir minds and spirits grow corrupted—\nthis sentence further elucidates the use of arms.\n\nThe people abound in clever schemes,\nstrange devices proliferate.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"The people\"* refers to the sovereign and his lords within a hundred-li territory.\nIf they indulge in clever schemes,\nengraving palaces and embroidering garments,\nstrange devices multiply—\nthe lower ranks will emulate their excesses,\nadorned in gold and jade,\nwith dyed silks and vibrant hues—\nsuch adornments will proliferate daily.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nExcessive cleverness breeds strange devices,\nsuperiors delight in objects, inferiors kindle desire.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Clever\"* refers to *\"scheming minds.\"*\n*\"Strange devices\"* are war implements.\nIf the sovereign favors martial pursuits,\nthe people must comply—\nthus each arises with strange contrivances,\ncompeting to offer clever schemes,\nforging war machines and siege engines,\npresenting myriad strange devices\nto attain great merit.\nThose who govern themselves indulge in clever schemes and deceits,\never greedy for gain,\ntheir discriminating minds\ngrow ever more corrupt—\nthis sentence again elucidates the use of arms.\n\nLaws and decrees multiply,\nthieves and robbers proliferate.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Laws\"* refer to *\"legal statutes and punishments.\"*\n*\"Decrees\"* are *\"teachings and commands.\"*\nIf the sovereign cannot curb his desires to govern the people,\nbut instead seeks to harmonize all with elaborate laws and decrees,\nthe people will merely evade punishment without shame,\nwhile officials will exploit the laws for personal gain—\nsuperior and inferior deceive each other,\nthus thieves and robbers proliferate.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Laws\"* are *\"precious things.\"*\nIf the sovereign values and displays precious things,\nagricultural labor is abandoned,\nhunger and cold ensue—\nthus thieves and robbers proliferate.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nPrecious things are *\"objects of law.\"*\nIf gold and jade are highly prized,\nthieves and robbers will arise.\nIt also states that laws, meant to suppress theft, instead breed more thieves,\nand rituals, intended to restore order, instead foster greater chaos.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Objects of law\"* are akin to *\"laws and decrees.\"*\nWhen legal statutes and punishments are prominently displayed,\nlaws and decrees grow ever more numerous—\ncloth woven with fat, armor that cannot be pierced from three sides,\npeople cannot endure such oppressive measures—\nthose who flee become many,\nand reckless thefts arise—\nthus thieves and robbers proliferate.\nAs the governance grows ever more intricate,\nthe people’s evasion becomes ever more concealed.\nThis sentence again elucidates governance through laws.\n\n「The fourth section draws upon the Sage, revealing the beauty of *wuwei* [非作為, \"non-action\"]. Thus the Sage says: *\"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves;*\n*I do no work, and the people grow wealthy;*\n*I love tranquility, and the people become upright;*\n*I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"I act with non-action\"*—the Sage speaks of himself, for the Sage’s **virtue/power** [德] does not rely on clever stratagems. He embodies the essence of the Dao/Way, valuing *wuwei* [無為]. *Wuwei* means there is nothing to forbid or restrict; the Sage’s own *wuwei* [無為] allows the people to transform themselves accordingly.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** [河上公] says: *\"Thus the Sage speaks\"*—referring to matters below. *\"I act with non-action\"* means the Sage cultivates the Dao/Way and follows Heaven’s mandate, making no alterations, and yet the people transform themselves.\n\n**Master Rong** [荣] says: The preceding lines warn against four forms of *wei* [作為, \"artificial action\"]—the maladies of governance. Hence, the Sage prescribes four *wuwei* [無為] remedies to eliminate chaos and achieve transformation, to attain stillness by abandoning movement, to ensure domestic peace and cultural harmony, and to let things unfold naturally so that the people know contentment and grow wealthy, follow the Dao/Way without deviation and return to simplicity by discarding excess.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage’s **virtue/power** [德] is tranquil and detached, *wuwei* [無為]. Beneath him, the people abandon vice and embrace goodness. The Sage is indeed a Sage, yet he modestly attributes his teachings to other Sages, hence *Zhuangzi* [《莊子》] says: *\"My allegories are nineteen in number.\"* [寓言十九]\n\n*\"I do no work, and the people grow wealthy,\"*\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage’s heart is free from artificial action, and his governance is simple—each of the four classes [四民] pursues their respective occupations, the six directions [六合] aligned in harmony, with lightened burdens and sparse taxation. If not for this, what would make the people wealthy?\n\n*\"I love tranquility, and the people become upright,\"*\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage above embraces stillness, not troubling the people, so they inherit the pure winds of nature and naturally return to the upright path.\n\n*\"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWhen the Sage above has few desires and little selfishness, maintains purity and simplicity, the people know contentment and abide by their proper roles, returning to simplicity.\n\nThe following lines all elucidate the meaning of *taking the world without action* [無事取天下].\n\n**Chapter 58: \"His Governance is Obscure and Obscure\"**\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous one is that the prior chapter expounds upon the Sage who follows the Dao/Way and governs through *wuwei* [無為], while the unrighteous ruler multiplies laws and decrees. Thus, this chapter broadens the discussion: the governance of the Daoist Sage is obscure and effortless, while that of the unrighteous is meticulous and invasive. The meaning flows in continuity, hence its placement.\n\nThis chapter is divided into four distinct sections. The first distinguishes between two forms of governance—lenient and harsh—and their differing effects. The second contrasts the two outcomes of governance—calamity and blessing—showing their unpredictability. The third laments the prolonged ignorance of ordinary beings, not limited to this life alone. The fourth illustrates the Sage’s transcendence of merit, concealing his light and brilliance.\n\n**First Section: Distinguishing Lenient and Harsh Governance, Their Different Effects.**\nIt is said that Yao opened the Four Gates [四門], and the people rejoiced in the *jiren* [擊壤] song of contentment. Qin unified the hundred districts [百郡], yet the nation became a ruin, its people suffering calamity. Thus one knows that governance and teaching lie in simplicity and naturalness—why must they be meticulously enforced? Hence, when Jin Wu became Emperor, he burned the *Zhitou* [雉頭] tax records to restore harmony, and when Shi Qing served as a minister, he counted only the horses to uphold integrity. The Sage’s heart is empty, aligning with the Dao/Way, and even snoring can yield pearls. The rigid ruler loses his life by clinging to his intentions, as Jing Ke did by returning his sword. The outcomes of calamity and blessing—are they not thus determined?\n\n**Lamenting the Prolonged Ignorance of Heaven’s Sentient Beings:**\nThe days of their delusion are indeed long. The sorrow of hell’s torments, yet their heads still gather there. The joy of heaven’s paradise, yet their hearts depart and do not ascend. Only when they are at their wits’ end do they wag their tails in submission—how wretched is their plight! When suffering comes, they begin to strike their heads in repentance—what use is regret then? Strive to reflect and awaken, and cast off the shackles of this mortal coil!\n\n**His governance is obscure and obscure, his people are pure and pure.**\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nGovernance that is obscure and obscure—*wuwei* [無為] and lenient—leads the people to respond with natural purity and simplicity.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nObscure and obscure [闷闷]—lenient and expansive. Pure and pure [淳淳]—simple and sincere. The Sage above governs through *wuwei* [無為], and his policies are lenient and expansive, so the people beneath him follow and become pure and simple.\n\n**His governance is meticulous and meticulous, his people are deficient and deficient.**\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nGovernance that is meticulous and meticulous—*wei* [作為] and harsh—leads the people to respond with deficiency and decay.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nMeticulous and meticulous [察察]—*wei* [作為] and strict. The governance of the Sage is lenient and expansive, allowing things to unfold naturally. Since there is no cruelty, the people’s customs become pure and simple. His governance is meticulous and invasive, yet the people grow deficient and exhausted.\n\n**缺缺**—decay and dispersion. The ruling lord who acts (*youwei*), whose governance is stern and urgent, who binds people with laws, whose decrees proliferate—then thieves and bandits multiply, and the people wither and scatter.\n\n**River Upper Master** said: His governance is meticulous and urgent—words spoken in haste, ears straining to listen. His people are deficient and deficient—governance is urgent and harsh, the people cannot sustain life, so they grow ever more sparse and thin.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*察察*—stern and swift. *缺缺*—scattered and ruined. The ruler favors action, governs with haste, and the people suffer under his tyranny, thus they scatter.\n\n**On governing oneself**, one should also cultivate emptiness, forgetfulness, and leniency—never clinging to a hasty or rigid heart.\n\n---\n**Second: The Two Disciples of Calamity and Fortune—leaning and hidden, without fixed end.**\n\nCalamity! Fortune leans upon it.\nFortune! Calamity hides within it.\nWho knows its ultimate measure?\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*倚*—rooted in. *伏*—concealed. Earlier, it spoke of lenient governance, yet the people deemed it lacking in order, yet became pure and simple—this is calamity giving rise to fortune. Stern governance, yet the people saw it as virtuous governance unfolding, yet they withered and scattered—this is fortune concealing calamity.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nCalamity! Fortune leans upon it—earlier, it spoke of lenient governance, which the people took as evil, yet they became pure and sincere—how is this not fortune arising from calamity? Fortune! Calamity hides within it—*伏*, concealed. Stern governance, which the people took as good, yet things decayed and scattered—how is this not calamity hidden within fortune, ready to emerge? Who knows its ultimate measure? Those who lose the Dao and abandon virtue, indulging in deceit and superficiality—thus calamity and fortune cycle, leaning and hidden without fixed rule. Who can know their true end?\n\n**River Upper Master** said: Calamity! Fortune leans upon it—*倚*, rooted in. Fortune arises from calamity: when people face calamity and repent, take responsibility, cultivate goodness, and follow the Way, then calamity departs and fortune arrives. Fortune! Calamity hides within it—calamity lurks within fortune. When people obtain fortune yet grow arrogant and licentious, then fortune departs and calamity comes. Who knows its ultimate measure? Calamity and fortune generate each other endlessly; none can fathom their final limit.\n\n**Master Yan** said: Fortune arises from calamity, calamity from fortune. Calamity and fortune, though distinct, share the same root—thus abandoning fortune means no calamity, no calamity means no fortune. Fortune without fortune is the most subtle and profound; none in the world can exhaust its depths.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nCalamity! Fortune leans upon it. Fortune! Calamity hides within it. *倚*—rooted in. *伏*—concealed. Lenient governance brings fortune; stern governance invites calamity. These two matters stem from the same heart—fortune leans upon calamity, calamity hides within fortune; their principle is not distant. Who knows its ultimate measure? Its standard is unclear. *孰*—who. The signs of calamity and fortune arise from good and evil; since deeds are unstable, so too are their rewards. Thus they cycle through the Three Realms, return to the Six Paths, in myriad transformations—who can know their end?\n\nOnly the superior sage, forgetting self to aid others, embodying this true Dao, awakening to the Profound Mystery—unmoved by the causes of good and evil—thus escapes calamity and fortune’s reach. As *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Calamity does not arrive, fortune does not come.\nCalamity and fortune are nonexistent—who would suffer disaster?\"*\n\nThus they turn endlessly without end—because they do not uphold the true Dao.\n\n---\n**Third: Lamenting the long-deluded common folk—this is not merely of this life.**\n\nIs there no true principle?\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nIs there no true principle? What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous. The extremes of calamity and fortune—is there truly no principle? Yet sentient beings cling to delusion, deeming the true as deceitful, the good as portents of ill—thus calamity and fortune lean and hide, as if no principle exists.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis speaks of the extremes of calamity and fortune—is there truly no fixed principle? Yet because people cannot embody the Dao of *wuwei*, they generate delusion, losing the true principle.\n\n**River Upper Master** said: *无*—not. The ruler does not rectify himself—then there is no state.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nIs there no true principle? What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous. *奇*—strange, *妖*—evil. The deeds of good and evil returning—this is all as it should be. The silent, solitary true principle alone is true. Most accumulate filth, few have purity—thus it is said there is no true principle. Those who follow evil are many; those who follow the true are few. Even if one acts rightly, the true is not always true—suddenly it shifts, thus it is called strange. All commit evil, unwilling to do good—even if one acts well, goodness does not endure, soon returning to evil, thus it is called ominous. What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis explains the source of deluded principle. Sentient beings are confused about the true principle of calamity and fortune—unaware of the true, they deem it deceitful; unenlightened to goodness, they call it an omen. Thus it seems as if there is no true principle.\n\n**River Upper Master** said: What is true becomes strange—*奇*, deceit. The ruler does not rectify himself; though the people below may act rightly, they in turn corrupt the ruler’s sincerity.\n\n「善复为妖，善人皆复化上为妖祥也。」\nEven the virtuous are transformed into omens of ill fortune—all are made to corrupt the ruler’s sincerity through their own goodness.\n\n「○成疏：正复为奇，奇，虚诈也。」\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** What is true becomes strange—*奇*, deceit. The very essence of deceit.\n\n「假使有心学於正道者，则执正为正，未解忘遣，不与实性相应，故为虚诈也。」\nIf one earnestly studies the Dao/Way, they cling to what they deem true, yet fail to transcend forgetfulness and illusion. Their understanding does not align with the genuine nature, thus they fall into emptiness and deceit.\n\n「善复为妖，纵为善者，犹执名言，既乖正理，适为妖孽，故《庄子》云：为声为名，为妖为孽。」\nEven when one acts with virtue, they still grasp at mere words—contrary to true principle, they become agents of *miao* and *nie*. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"To cling to sound and name is to become *miao* and *nie*.\"*\n\n「民之迷，其日固久。」\nThe people’s delusion has endured for ages.\n\n「○御注：以正为奇，以善为妖，如此迷倒，其日固以久。」\n**Imperial Annotation:** To take what is true as strange and virtue as *miao*, such profound delusion has indeed lasted long.\n\n「○御疏：此叹众生迷於正善，妄以为奇为妖，其所由来尚矣，故云其日固久。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** This laments how sentient beings are deluded about true virtue, mistakenly calling it strange or *miao*. Their confusion is ancient, hence it is said their delusion endures.\n\n「○河上公曰：言人君迷惑失正以来，其日固久也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: It speaks of how rulers, since their confusion and loss of true principle, have been deluded for ages.\n\n「○荣曰：迷祸福之源，惑邪正之路，此非旦夕，其日固久。」\n**Master Rong** said: To be lost in the origins of calamity and fortune, bewildered by the paths of vice and virtue—this is no fleeting error, their delusion is indeed long-standing.\n\n「成疏：言凡鄙之人，所以为妖奇者，以其愚痴迷惑故也。」\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Common folk become strange and *miao* because of their inherent stupidity and confusion.\n\n「此之迷惑，其日久固，抑乃无始，岂日今生。」\nThis delusion has lasted long, yet it is not merely of recent origin—it began without a starting point, not just in this life.\n\n「《西升经》云：如是迷来久。」\nThe *Sutra of Western Ascension* states: *\"Thus, their delusion has endured for long.\"*\n\n「第四显圣人忘功，韬光匿曜。」\nFourth, it reveals how the Sage forgets merit, conceals brilliance, and hides radiance.\n\n「是以圣人方而不割，\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Hence, the Sage is square yet does not cut—\n\n「廉而不秽，\npure yet not defiled,\n\n「直而不肆，\nhonest yet not self-righteous,\n\n「光而不耀，」\nbrilliant yet not dazzling—\nthe Sage’s virtue transforms without cutting, defiling, or forcing. They cultivate within themselves, and the world naturally follows suit.\n\n「圣人善化，不割彼而为方，不秽彼而为康，不申彼而为直，不耀彼而为光，修之身而天下自化矣。」\nThe Sage’s transformative power is gentle—never cutting to impose squareness, never defiling to bring purity, never asserting to enforce honesty, nor dazzling to manifest brightness. They refine within themselves, and the world spontaneously aligns.\n\n「○御疏：方，正也。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Fang*, means upright.\n\n「举圣德以劝修，圣人弘道济世，示物向方，身行方正，物则应之而自正，非立言教裁割於物使从己也。」\nThe Sage’s virtue is held up to encourage cultivation. The Sage expounds the Dao/Way and aids the world, guiding all toward rectitude. Their own conduct is upright, and things respond accordingly, becoming upright themselves—never imposing rigid teachings or cutting others to force compliance.\n\n「○河上公曰：圣人行方正者，欲以率下，不以割截人也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: The Sage acts with uprightness to lead the people below, never to cut or constrain them.\n\n「○荣曰：方，正也，割，伤也，邪行则物我俱伤，正道则彼此无割。」\n**Master Rong** said: *Fang* means upright; *ge* means harm. When vice prevails, both self and others are harmed. Yet in true principle, there is no mutual injury.\n\n「廉而不秽，\nPure yet not defiled—\n\n「○御疏：廉，清也。秽，浊也。圣人率性清康，自然化下，非秽彼之浊以扬其清。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Lian* means purity; *hui* means turbidity. The Sage follows their natural purity, effortlessly transforming the world below—never defiling others to elevate their own clarity.\n\n「有本为创字者，创，伤也，圣人康以成行，不伤於物。」\nOriginally, *hui* was written as *chuang* (创), meaning harm. The Sage’s purity completes their conduct without harming others.\n\n「○河上公曰：圣人康清欲以化民，不以伤害人也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: The Sage’s purity aims to transform the people, never to harm them.\n\n「今则不然，正己以害人也。」\nNow it is otherwise: one rectifies themselves to harm others.\n\n「○荣曰：凡情贪而浊，圣道康而清。」\n**Master Rong** said: Common desires are greedy and turbid, while the Sage’s path is pure and clear.\n\n「○成疏：妙体物境也空幻，无可贪取，非关卓尔清康，避世之秽，斯则净秽双遣，责康两忘，不康而康，秽而不秽，故《庄子》云：大康不嗛，又云：廉清不信。」\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** The profound nature of all phenomena is empty and illusory—nothing to covet. This is not about standing out in purity or avoiding the world’s turbidity. Rather, it transcends both defilement and purity, casting off all dualistic notions of praise or blame, neither clinging to purity nor being bound by defilement. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Great purity is not rigid\"* and *\"Purity and clarity are not trusted.\"* (Note: *信* here as *trustworthy* in the sense of being rigid or dogmatic.)\n\n「直而不肆，\nHonest yet not self-righteous—\n\n「○御疏：肆，申也。圣人之行不邪，彼自从而正直，非为彼之不正，而申直以正曲也。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Shi* (肆) means to assert. The Sage’s conduct is never crooked—others follow naturally, becoming upright. It is not about correcting others’ crookedness by forcing honesty upon them.\n\n「○河上公曰：肆，申也，圣人虽直，曲己从人，不自申也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: *Shi* means to assert. Though the Sage is honest, they bend to follow others, never asserting themselves.\n\n「○荣曰：大直若届，不显正以示人。」\n**Master Rong** said: Great honesty seems to yield—never flaunting uprightness to show others.\n\n「○成疏：肆，申也。素质雅正，体无邪谄，而曲从於物，不申己直，故前章云大直若屈也。」\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** *Shi* means to assert. The Sage’s innate nature is upright, their being free of deceit or flattery, yet they bend to follow things without asserting their own honesty. Hence, the previous chapter says: *\"Great honesty seems to bow.\"*\n\n「光而不耀。」\nBrilliant yet not dazzling.\n\n「○御疏：光者谓明智也，圣人虽有明智而韬晦之，不以炫耀，故云光而不耀。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Guang* refers to wisdom and clarity. Though the Sage possesses wisdom, they conceal it, never flaunting brilliance—thus it is said: *\"Brilliant yet not dazzling.\"*\n\n「圣德如此，自然百姓淳淳而从化也。」\nThe Sage’s virtue is thus: the people spontaneously become pure and follow transformation.\n\n「○河上公曰：圣人虽有独知之明，常如暗昧，不以耀乱人也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: Though the Sage possesses singular wisdom, they act as if in darkness, never dazzling others into confusion.\n\n「○荣曰：明道若昧也，前标得失之政，次指祸福之门，而没溺者既多，昏迷者已久，妖奇则系累之境，倚伏非悬解之场，是以康而不秽，始体清虚之道，光而不耀，方识慧源之路，冥得失，何祸何福乎，混是非，孰邪孰正乎，泛兮无系无不系，肃然无可无不可。」\n**Master Rong** said: The Sage’s clarity seems like obscurity. Though they reveal the principles of gain and loss, and the gates of calamity and fortune, many are drowned in ignorance, and many have been long in darkness. The strange and *miao* bind them in suffering, while dependence and subjugation offer no escape. Thus, purity without defilement begins with embodying the Dao of clarity and emptiness, brilliance without dazzle reveals the path of wisdom. In the depths of gain and loss, who knows of calamity or fortune? In the confusion of right and wrong, who discerns vice or virtue? Floating freely, neither bound nor unbound, solemn yet without constraint or possibility—*thus the Sage transcends all dualities.*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one because, after clarifying the governance through the Dao to achieve purity and harmony, it further emphasizes governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses the application of the Dao.\n\nWithin this chapter, four teachings unfold:\n1. The first elucidates that governing the myriad people begins with the Dao.\n2. The second asserts that even when employing the Dao, one must accumulate virtue and amass deeds.\n3. The third reveals that such accumulation makes one a transformative sovereign.\n4. The fourth demonstrates that deep-rooted stability ensures enduring vision and longevity.\n\n**First: Governing the Myriad People Begins with the Dao.**\nThe Dao hangs like an empty vessel—yet those who deny it commit the greatest blasphemy. Virtue, when steadfast, becomes the fundamental principle for all.\n\nA ruler of a realm must walk in rectitude, then the lofty peaks of Emei will bow, winds will descend upon the Celestial Sovereign’s hall, and the mountains of Yangjiao will summon the Sage of Li. Is this not proof that virtue lies in early submission, and the Dao is thus revered? When royal edicts are issued, all obey without hesitation—no one is expelled for three offenses. Loyalty and filial piety are embraced, while the King of Yang’s stern commands are obeyed first. Even the wine pools of Zhao and Mozi’s chariot turn back—thus, rectitude is the foundation of the state, while deceit is the work of men. In governing both people and Heaven, nothing surpasses the Dao.\n\nTo employ the Dao is to govern with ease; deceit and chaos are difficult to rectify. Those with deep roots and firm foundations, who endure and thrive, rely externally on spoken teachings and internally cultivate serenity. They endure Heaven’s floods without drifting, withstand Earth’s flames without scorching—no one knows their limits, for such is the result of accumulated virtue.\n\n**Governing the People and Serving Heaven: Nothing Surpasses Frugality.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* Frugality means love.\n\nWhen a ruler seeks to govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality—ensuring granaries are full, people observe rites, and the three seasons bring no harm. Then Heaven will bestow blessings.\n\nHarmony among the people governs them; Heaven’s protection serves Heaven.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Frugality means love. The ruler who wishes to transform the people and revere Heaven must first practice frugality—frugality is the virtue of thrift. Thrift ensures sufficiency, gathering the people. Abundant offerings honor Heaven’s virtue, hence, nothing surpasses frugality.\n\n*River Above Master (严君平)*: Governing people means the ruler harmonizes the populace. Serving Heaven means employing Heaven’s ways, aligning with the four seasons. Nothing surpasses frugality—frugality is thrift. Governing a state requires cherishing the people’s wealth, avoiding extravagance. Governing oneself means cherishing one’s vital essence, avoiding dissipation.\n\n*Li Rong (李荣)*: To govern below and serve above, nothing exceeds using the Dao as the standard.\n\n*Master Cheng (成玄英)*: Heaven is nature; the standard is law. Nothing surpasses means there is no better way. The ruler who harmonizes with Heaven’s ways and transforms the common folk does so by employing the law of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n**Only frugality is called early submission.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* How does one gather the people? Through wealth—when a ruler practices frugality, people from all directions will bring tribute, submitting early to their lord.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Only frugality*—repeating the earlier phrase. Thus, early submission explains the meaning of frugality. In all seven transformations, the meaning follows this pattern. *Only* is an introductory phrase. *Submission* means service. Only a ruler who restrains and cherishes will govern people and serve Heaven through frugality, and thus all under Heaven will submit early.\n\n*River Above Master:* Early means prior; submission means virtue. The ruler who cherishes the people’s wealth and vital essence will first attain Heaven’s ways.\n\n*Li Rong:* Using the Dao as the standard, all things will naturally converge.\n\n*Master Cheng:* This *wuwei* law alone benefits both self and others. Applied to governing the body, it subdues all demons and trials; applied to governing the state, it draws distant lands into submission.\n\n**Second: Even When Employing the Dao, One Must Accumulate Virtue and Amass Deeds.**\nEarly submission is called *accumulating virtue*.\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* The ruler who practices frugality thus accumulates virtue, and the people, drawn to virtue, submit early to their lord—hence, *accumulating virtue*.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Why does all under Heaven revere and submit? Because of practiced frugality—frugality ensures the people submit early, thus virtue is deeply accumulated.\n\n*River Above Master:* Attaining Heaven’s ways first is called accumulating virtue for oneself.\n\n*Li Rong:* The Dao is light, virtue shallow—people will not submit. When virtue is deeply accumulated, all things will naturally submit.\n\n*Master Cheng:* *Accumulating* means deep accumulation; *virtue* means layered virtue. This speaks to those who internally subdue demons and externally pacify distant lands—one must accumulate deeds, making virtue profound before distant lands submit.\n\n**Accumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquered.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* The Sage accumulates virtue, and all under Heaven turns to benevolence—nothing remains unconquered.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Conquered* means ability. If a ruler deeply accumulates virtue, his governance will preserve all human strength, and his service to Heaven will bring unending good fortune. Thus, all under Heaven will submit, and nothing will remain unconquered.\n\n*River Above Master:* *Conquered* means subdued. Deeply accumulating virtue ensures nothing resists.\n\n*Li Rong:* Profound virtue and deep benevolence ensure nothing is unconquered.\n\n*Master Cheng:* *Conquered* means both subdued and attained. Accumulating deeds makes virtue profound, benefiting both self and others without loss. Internally and externally subdued, nothing remains unconquered.\n\n**Nothing is unconquered, thus no limits are known.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* A ruler’s virtue knows no inability to govern—thus, its reach is boundless, and all under Heaven knows no extremity.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* This means a ruler’s virtue knows no inability to subdue—thus, distant peoples admire and submit, and no land remains untouched. Hence, no limits are known.\n\n**Nothing is unconquered, thus no limits are known to one’s own virtue.**\n\n*River Above Master:* If nothing is unconquered and attained, then none will know the limits of one’s own virtue.\n\n*Yan (严) says:* If one takes frugality as the principle, the world will respond in harmony with the Dao—how could anyone know its limits?\n\n*Li Rong (荣) says:* When the four barbarian tribes submit as guests, borders vanish, and governance aligns with the Dao’s mystery—what limits could there be?\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* When capacity and object harmonize, principle knows no discord. Virtue and power stretch boundless, none able to fathom their limits.\n\n**Third, it illustrates that by accumulating deeds and amassing merit, one may become the master of transformation.**\n\nIf no limits are known, then one may have a realm.\n*Imperial Commentary:* Only when none know the limits of one’s virtue can one truly be said to have a realm.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* It speaks of a ruler whose transforming virtue reaches everywhere, whose merit draws all people, whose divine favor is ever bestowed—thus may one be called as having a realm. Beyond this, how could one claim to have a realm?\n\n*River Above Master:* If none know the limits of one’s own virtue, then one may establish the ancestral altars and bring blessings to the people.\n\n*Li Rong (荣) says:* Lands are boundless, virtue and power know no end—only then may one truly have a realm.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* Since principle knows no discord and virtue stretches boundless, one may thus have a realm to govern and transform the people, becoming a sovereign or a master of transformation.\n\n**The mother of having a realm is what makes it enduring.**\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* A realm that nurtures its people well will endure in blessings and longevity.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* \"Mother\" refers to the Dao, with nurturing as its meaning. Only because of the Dao may one be called as having a realm, and if one nurtures the common folk as such, blessings and longevity will flourish eternally, making it enduring.\n\n*River Above Master:* A realm and its ruler are one in essence; \"mother\" is the Dao. If one can preserve the Dao within oneself, ensuring one’s *qi* is not exhausted and the five spirits are not strained, then one may endure.\n\n*Li Rong (荣) says:* With the Dao, a realm is secure; without it, a realm is in peril. A realm arises from the Dao, and the Dao is the realm’s mother. To take the Dao as mother is why one may endure.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* The Conqueror-King (霸王) and the Dragon-King (龙成) say: Since they are rulers and sovereigns, nurturing the common folk like their own children, they are thus called \"mother.\" Though their virtue and deeds are lofty, they do not cling to action or empty detachment—thus they may endure.\n\n**Fourth, it illustrates deep-rooted stability and lasting vision.**\n\nThis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* Accumulating virtue to have a realm makes its roots deep and its foundation firm. The deep and firm is the Dao of enduring life and lasting vision.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* A ruler who accumulates virtue takes the Dao as their realm, and thus may endure. Hence, the analogy of roots and foundation is invoked to clarify its meaning. The \"foundation\" (蒂) is like the stalk of a flower. Just as plants with deep roots flourish and firm stalks do not fall, so too is their enduring nature. It likens a ruler who accumulates virtue, planting their roots in the Dao and securing their foundation in virtue—extending life is called enduring life, and constant illumination is called lasting vision. Thus, it is the Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.\n\n*River Above Master:* This is the Dao of deep-rooted stability. If one can take *qi* as root and essence as foundation, like a tree whose roots are not deep and will be uprooted, or whose stalk is not firm and will fall—one must deeply conceal their *qi* and firmly guard their essence, not allowing it to leak away. The Dao of enduring life and lasting vision is that of deep-rooted stability.\n\n*Li Rong (荣) says:* If roots rot, the stalk collapses; if the foundation decays, the stalk falls. Now, to govern with the Dao as root makes it deep, and to cultivate oneself with virtue as foundation makes it firm. A firm foundation brings enduring life, deep roots bring lasting vision—this is the pattern of heaven and humanity, the essentials of family and realm.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* Root is origin. Foundation is the manifestation. The root can generate the foundation, likening how origin can produce traces. The traces are called deep-rooted, and the origin is called firm-foundation. If roots are not deep, they will topple; if the foundation is not firm, it will crumble. Only because of deep roots does one endure life, and only because of a firm foundation does one attain lasting vision. This shows that the sage who has a realm possesses both origin and traces in perfection, hence the text says: \"The Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.\"\n\n**Vision is illumination.**\n\n*Chapter on Governing Great Realms, Chapter Sixty*\nThe chapter on governing great realms follows the previous one, for the prior chapter illustrates that if one aligns with the Dao in frugality and love, all affairs will be swiftly subdued, while this chapter shows that if one does not disturb the already subdued, then virtue will be mutually returned.\n\nThe text is divided into three parts: the first introduces the analogy of governing with the Dao, emphasizing non-action; the second shows that virtue benefits both people and spirits, causing no harm; the third concludes with praise for the mutual return of virtue, urging rulers who have realms.\n\n**First, it introduces the analogy of governing with the Dao, emphasizing non-action.**\n\nFor it is heard that the ruler is the primary leader—\nHolding the Dao in silence and facing the people, ministers serve as limbs and sinews, adjusting the transformations of yin and yang to regulate affairs. The Bear and the Tiger bow in submission, while the lower immortals ascend their halls to set the winds in motion. Sometimes wild geese fly into the court, or celestial dragons descend upon the thoroughfares, startling the world with transformation. All desire to engage in non-action, to settle the restless heart, to move like the deer that tames itself, to govern with such precision that the smallest fish cannot be harmed, and to ensure the four quarters find their place while the people all dwell in peace.\n\nYet, as seen in Ximen Bao’s lack of benevolence, drowning widows was excessive. As seen in Jiang Ziya’s embrace of virtue, the spirit maiden wept in the courtyard, and he transformed the chaotic customs like untying a knot, and his governance was as refined as weaving silk. Then, heads bowed in reverence as heaven took notice, stubborn necks submitted to human authority, fires were extinguished in Jiangling, and strange apparitions vanished in the cities. Ghosts did not bring calamity, spirits suffered no harm—thus virtue was mutually returned, and the world looked up to the pure and upright example.\n\n**To govern a great realm is like to cook a small fish.**\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Cooking means boiling. A small fish is a small fish. If one cooks a small fish improperly, it will break apart. It likens governing a great realm: if one troubles the people, they will fall into disorder. All must rely on the Dao to achieve success.\n\n「The second elucidates virtue/power and the relationship with ghosts and spirits—both without harm. Those who spread the Dao across the world will find their ghosts unspirited.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:** Governing a realm with excess troubles the populace, leading to chaos; refining oneself with excess troubles the spirit, causing it to scatter. When one spreads the Dao across the world, the ghosts remain unspirited. *Yi* means \"to use\"; *ling* means \"to manifest.\"\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Ghosts and spirits manifest in seclusion as the forces of the unseen. The term *lingxiao* (灵效) refers to their efficacy. When humans have desires, the spirits respond. Yet under the transformation of supreme virtue/power, people dwell in natural ease—how could it be only that the sovereign forgets the might of the spirits, but also that they do not rely on supplication? Thus, the ghosts in seclusion lack the means to manifest their efficacy.\n\nIt is not that these ghosts are unspirited, but that the spirits do not harm the people. **Imperial Exegesis:** When ghosts manifest monstrously, they harm people; when the sage acts, they harm people. Now, the reason ghosts do not manifest monstrously nor harm people is that the sage abides in non-action and tranquility.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** The saying that spirits do not harm people—does it mean only that spirits lack efficacy and cannot harm people? Rather, the sage governs with the Dao, causing no disturbance; the populace naturally aligns with righteousness. Hence, the sage also does not harm people. Then, the reason ghosts and spirits cannot manifest monstrously nor harm people is that the sage spreads the Dao across the world. To further clarify the sage’s virtue/power, it is repeated that the sage also does not harm people.\n\n**River Above Master (河上公):** It is not that ghosts and spirits cannot harm people; rather, when the sage holds office, they do not dare to interfere, for the sage does not harm people.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:** These ghosts and spirits cannot harm people, but when the sage presides above, virtue/power extends to both the seen and unseen, and ghosts and spirits cause no harm—because the sage does not harm.\n\nThey can also benefit the people, and thus they themselves do not harm.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** All versions write *yi* (亦), but only Zhang Xishan (张系师) and Lu Xiansheng (陆先生) use *zhi* (之). Since *zhi* and *yi* are similar in form, scribes mistakenly wrote *yi*. Now, we adopt *zhi* as correct. It means that these ghosts do not harm the people, but rather, it is because the sage governs the world with the Dao, subduing evil and wickedness, that the ghosts no longer harm people. The power lies in the sage’s governance, hence the saying that the sage does not harm people.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis (治身者):** When refining oneself, it is not that stirring the heart cannot harm conduct—rather, the sage’s wisdom suppresses and controls such stirrings, so even if the heart moves, it cannot harm the stillness. Thus, the inner and outer conduct both return to the self.\n\nIf one is both still and in motion, what is being suppressed? Now, it is clarified that suppression occurs even when there is no suppression, and response occurs even when there is no response—meaning that the response arises naturally.\n\n**The Third: Seclusion and Manifestation Observe Their Boundaries, Virtue and Wisdom Return Together.**\nSince both do not harm each other, virtue/power is mutually returned.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** When ghosts and spirits harm people, it harms the realm and depletes its foundation; when the sage harms people, it exhausts the spirit and lacks reverence. Now, since neither harms the other, virtue/power is mutually returned.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** The two refer to the sage and the spirits. Humans are the foundation of the realm and also the master of the spirits. If ghosts and spirits harm people, it harms the realm’s foundation; if the sage harms people, it exhausts the spirit’s master. Now, since neither harms the other, virtue/power is mutually returned. Not only do the spirits and sage flourish alone, but all people also rely on this. **River Above Master:** Since both do not harm each other—the ghosts and the sage—virtue/power is mutually returned. When both do not harm each other, the people are governed in the seen, the ghosts in the unseen; the people preserve their lives, the ghosts safeguard their spirits, hence virtue/power is mutually returned.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:** Ghosts, spirits, and the sage—these are the two. Both can benefit the people without harm. The sage is compassionate and kind, the ghosts and spirits are upright and just; compassion and kindness manifest in the seen and shine brightly, while uprightness and justice dwell in the unseen and quietly accumulate. Both bestow virtue/power and blessings upon the people, thus virtue/power and wisdom return together.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** The two refer to ghosts dwelling in the unseen and humans in the seen. Seclusion and manifestation each find their place, without mutual harm. Then, humans bestow virtue/power upon ghosts, and ghosts repay with blessings—virtue and kindness flow in return, hence they mutually adhere.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis (治身者):** Refining oneself means suppressing agitation to return to stillness, thus perfecting one’s conduct. From stillness arises motion, to respond to the myriad people; motion does not contradict stillness, hence there is no harm. This is why inner and outer conduct both return to the self.\n\n**The Great Realm Chapter: Chapter Sixty-One**\nThe *Great Realm* chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter elucidates the use of the Dao and non-action in subduing and testing malevolent forces. Thus, this chapter follows, clarifying the use of the Dao in dealing with people while maintaining the power of humility and harmony.\n\nThis chapter opens three distinct meanings:\n1. It elucidates dealing with people through humility and harmony, using stillness to suppress agitation;\n2. It elucidates the small and great observing their boundaries, each possessing their own yielding and firm qualities;\n3. It elucidates restraining the high and proud to extinguish their arrogance and ambition.\n\n「The First Meaning: Dealing with Others in Humility and Harmony, Using Stillness to Suppress Agitation\nThe myriad rivers converge at the sea, the Four Great Elements[注: *四大*, the classical Buddhist elements of earth, water, fire, and wind] in their majesty are called *King*[注: *王*, here symbolizing supreme authority]. The King, though solitary and exalted, is said to be *Na-Guo*[注: *孤寡*, a term of self-effacement], while the sea, in its boundless embrace, attains greatness. Thus, one knows that mountains, though steep and towering, further enhance the earth’s lowly and yielding nature, while the sea’s virtue is vast and deep, gathering all rivers into its embrace. The lowly flow receives the multitude, the humble retreat becomes the object of reverence. Zi Gong borrowed horses and never returned them, while Liu Kuang begged for a cow before sending one in return—both acts stemmed from minds untroubled by ambition, their wills aligned with yielding and harmony. Small states thus find attachment through submission, while great states are enriched by acts of deference and self-restraint. To hold victory in strength is to err; words that do not align with this principle are flawed. The virtuous of later ages may follow this intent.\n\nThe great state is the lowly confluence, the meeting place of all under heaven.\n\n**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**\nThe lowly confluence is the virtue of humility.\n\nThe great state must open itself in humility and embrace others, thus becoming the meeting place of all under heaven.\n\n**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**\nThe rivers and streams descend to the sea, and all converge there—hence, the term *lowly confluence*. This humility in bestowing upon others is the virtue of humility.\n\nThe ruler of a state, if he follows the Dao, preserves his realm; if he lacks virtue, his people scatter. Thus, the great state must open itself in humility and embrace others, allowing all under heaven to gather and meet, thereby securing its grandeur—hence, the saying: *The great state is the lowly confluence, the meeting place of all under heaven*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe great state is the lowly confluence—one must govern a great state as though dwelling in the lowly confluence, not resisting the smallest currents. The meeting place of all under heaven is where the people of the world gather.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe great state is vast in territory; with the Dao, it is steadfast as a *Pan Shi*[注: *盘石*, a massive, unyielding rock], secure as *Tai Shan*[注: *泰山*, Mount Tai, symbolizing stability]. Without the Dao, it is perilous as a *Lei Mao*[注: *累卯*, a pile of unstable stones], lighter than a *Hong Mao*[注: *鸿毛*, feather]. It should not arrogantly exalt itself.\n\n**Rong says:**\n*Exchange* means *convergence*. The sea lies beneath all currents, and rivers thus gather there. Likewise, the ruler of a great state, in self-perception, must regard himself as deficient, so that all states may unite in reverence.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe great state is a realm of *Ten Thousand Chariots*[注: *万乘*, a state with vast military resources]. *Confluence* refers to the outer suburbs[注: *郊郭*, outskirts or borders]. *The* means *to go*. The great state, in its magnanimity, is like the rivers and seas, receiving all currents beneath it—thus, all states vie to pour their tribute. The great state, through its Dao of humility and harmony, gathers all realms, near and far, in allegiance, filling its borders with those who follow its virtue. The term *exchange* here also refers to the great state’s humility, enabling its convergence with smaller states.\n\nThe meeting place of all under heaven is *feminine*—for the feminine always triumphs through stillness over the masculine.\n\n**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**\nThe people of the world gather because they are drawn to the great state’s humility, just as the feminine, through its yielding stillness, is always sought by the restless masculine—hence, stillness is the path of humility.\n\n**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**\nThe term *meeting place of all under heaven* echoes earlier passages, reinforcing the meaning of *lowly confluence*. It states that the people of the world gather because the ruler of the great state employs the Dao of humility, allowing the feminine to prevail in its yielding stillness, which is why it is sought by the restless masculine—hence, *the feminine always triumphs through stillness over the masculine*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe feminine Dao of the great state is rooted in still humility. The feminine bends the masculine, and yin overcomes yang, for it remains tranquil and does not seek first.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe feminine is yielding and still, the masculine is forceful and restless. Stillness can govern restlessness, yin can bend yang—thus, one knows that humility subdues arrogance, and weakness overcomes strength. Stillness is the path of humility.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe term *meeting place of all under heaven* reiterates the earlier passage. The feminine is yielding and still, the masculine is forceful and restless. The great state’s ability to make all states submit and converge lies in its constant use of humility and yielding stillness, thereby triumphing over forceful restlessness. If it were to employ force and restlessness, it would fail to attract them. Thus, one knows that governing oneself and one’s state must begin with yielding and harmony.\n\nThe Second Meaning: Small and Great States Observe Their Boundaries, Each Employing Their Own Yielding and Firm Qualities.\nThus, the great state submits to the small state and takes from it;\n**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**\nThe great takes from the small, making them subjects.\n\nThe small takes from the great, seeking aid.\n\n**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**\n*Thus* follows the preceding passage, reinforcing its meaning. The ruler of the great state does not rely on coercion but on the virtue of humility to gently subdue others, intending to draw in the rulers of smaller states, taking their people as subjects.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nIf one can practice humility, it will always endure. Thus, there will be no faults.\n\n**Rong says:**\nHumility as virtue can contain others; if one cannot yet be humble and yielding, they cannot gather or be taken.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\n*With* means *to employ*; *humility* means *yielding deference*; *taking* means *to transform and assimilate*. The Sage-ruler, when presiding over a great state, skillfully employs humility and harmony, thereby transforming and assimilating all realms, near and distant, into submission. Is this not fitting?\n\nThe small state submits to the great state and takes from it;\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe great state’s ruler, having employed the Dao of humility to gently subdue the small state, sees the small state’s ruler offering tribute, attending court, and forming alliances, never daring to rebel. The small state’s ruler, in his yielding deference, seeks the great state’s protection as aid.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThis says that states have no small or great—if one can hold humility and gather others, there will be no faults.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe small state, knowing its own humility, observes its boundaries, yielding and gathering within the great state’s embrace, following its virtue and revering its customs.»\n\n「Thus, sometimes one yields to take, and sometimes one yields while taking. **Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** *Yielding to take* refers to the great state subduing the small; *yielding while taking* refers to the small state submitting to the great.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Exegesis:**\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *\"When a teacher can command both left and right, it is called 'yielding to take.'\"*\nWhen one yields to take, it means the great state employs the Dao of humility to subdue the small state, thereby making its ruler compliant—able to be swayed either left or right. Hence, it is called *yielding to take*.\nWhen one yields while taking, it means the small state employs the Dao of humility to submit to the great state, only seeking to pay tribute and receive aid, unable to command its own left and right at will. Hence, it is called *yielding while taking*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nYielding means the great state yields to the small state, and the small state yields to the great state, taking turns in offering virtue and deference.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThis is about uniting two states.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nSometimes, the small state uses softness and thus takes from the great state; sometimes, the great state uses humility and thus earns the favor of all states. The use of humility unites them, but the act of taking separates them—hence the word *sometimes*.\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others, while the small state seeks only to enter and serve others. **Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** The great state, when employing humility to subdue the small state, seeks only to encompass and nurture the small state’s people as subjects. The small state, when offering tribute and paying homage to the great state, seeks only to enter and serve the great state for aid.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWhen the great state uses humility to subdue the small state, it has no ulterior motive—only to encompass and nurture the small state’s people as its ruler. When the small state uses humility to seek the great state’s favor, it has no other intention—only to enter and serve the great state, relying on it for aid.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others, so it must not be lost—thus it annexes and shepherds smaller states. The small state seeks only to enter and serve others, becoming their subjects and servants.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe great state must spread its influence far and wide, embodying the august virtue of the sovereign. The small state must only reverence the Dao’s transformation, seeking to submit within its boundaries. Both fulfill their aspirations, yet the great state should especially practice humility.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe two states—great and small—each seek their own desires: the great state to encompass and nurture, the small state to enter and serve. Though both employ softness and humility, the great state should particularly practice humility, for things are never lightened by the small but always oppressed by the great. Thus, the great state is commanded to yield, embodying the meaning of *\"the high should be restrained.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao/Way as Chapter**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded on guarding stillness, practicing humility, and employing the Dao in interactions. Hence, this chapter reveals the Dao’s profound essence, guiding all things to return in dependence.\n\nThis chapter unfolds four distinct themes:\n1. The Dao’s ability to embrace all, urging beings to cherish it;\n2. Its refusal to abandon the lowly, perpetually extending great compassion;\n3. Its discernment of advantage and harm, clarifying victory and defeat;\n4. Its hypothetical questions, praising the Dao’s transformative power.\n\n---\n**First: The Dao’s Ability to Embrace All, Urging Beings to Cherish It**\nThe great Dao is without partiality, the supreme mystery that encompasses all. Its divine power is unending, a treasure for those who recognize goodness. It stands beyond the golden gates, transcending the iron barriers, descending to the humble and nourishing them, even as they float on a fleeting life. It dwells in the boundless, yet remains serene in its origin, its song eternal and its harmony everlasting. Within the lion’s throne, fierce beasts gather, yet when the moment arises, they act in accordance. When the opportunity fades, they forget. The heart wanders freely in the pool of liberation, riding the vessel of compassion to save all beings.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established, the Three Dukes appointed, the four steeds of black and white dismissed, and a single carriage alone is used for progress. The adornments of jade and the rituals of obeisance—how vast are they! Yet none surpass the virtue of urging all to follow this Dao, ever increasing.\n\nThe Dao is the supreme mystery of all things.\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** All things draw their origin from the wondrous source; this is the place from which they derive sustenance. Hence, it is called the supreme mystery of all things.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Dao is another name for the wondrous source. *Mystery* means *inner*—the Dao contains all without exclusion, the origin from which all things arise. Hence, it is called the supreme mystery of all things. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: *\"The Dao is profound and mysterious, the fountain of emptiness and nothingness\"*—this is what is meant.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*Mystery* means *hidden*—the Dao is the hidden treasure of all things, containing all without exception.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nAll things take form from Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth arise from the formless. The Dao, through the formless form, opens the void, guides divine illumination, unites Heaven and Earth, penetrates yin and yang, flows through the four seasons, and governs the myriad regions. Though shapes and kinds differ, all are able to manifest and transform. It governs the eternal cycle of change, yet remains without constant, without favor or aversion—harmonizing with all things in great unity.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things, the precious treasure of the virtuous, and the refuge of the unvirtuous. Treasure means weighty—though the Dao is formless in its root, its principle is purely empty and still. Yet it enfolds the formless within manifest symbols, and receives the empty and still into the movements of living beings. Thus it is called the hidden essence of all things.\n\nThe refined and upright, with their rectitude, can hold fast to the true. The base and foolish, entangled in perversity, scorn the Dao. Hence there are those who treasure it and those who do not.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nThe Dao is the wondrous principle of boundless emptiness, the innate nature of all sentient beings. Hidden means profound and secret, also the repository of treasures. The Dao can generate all existence, encompassing the myriad spirits, with nothing it does not contain. Thus it is the repository and hidden treasure of all things.\n\nThe precious treasure of the virtuous.\n**Imperial Commentary:** The virtuous know that those who uphold the Dao flourish, while those who abandon it perish. Therefore, they always cherish and value it, without ever neglecting it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Treasure means precious and valuable. The virtuous, being in accord with the Dao and practicing non-action, maintain purity in body and mind. Thus they cherish and value it, without ever straying from it.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** The virtuous regard the Dao as their most precious treasure, not daring to defy it.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:** Those who practice the Dao and are virtuous perceive true nature, and obtain the mystic pearl from the Crimson Stream. Thus they are able to cherish and value it.\n\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n**Imperial Commentary:** Refuge means entrusting. The unvirtuous, unable to cherish the supreme Dao, when confronted with calamity or urgency, resort to relying upon the Dao with their bodies to seek deliverance.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Refuge means to guard and uphold. Common folk are immersed in material attachments, their dispositions shallow and competitive. How could they guard and uphold it? Fine words can be bought, noble conduct can be rewarded.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** The Dao is the refuge of the unvirtuous. Even in times of suffering and peril, they still know to repent and humble themselves.\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nTo sweeten one’s speech so that it may be sold like merchandise, to elevate one’s conduct so that it may surpass others—this is to liken the Sage, who employs speech as sweet as lawful flavors and conduct as noble and pure, to transform the unvirtuous. Thus, like merchants selling their wares, they follow the good.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis is an illustrative metaphor. It means that even the unvirtuous are within the scope of instruction. The Annotation says: *\"Sweetened speech can be sold like merchandise; noble conduct can surpass others.\"* This likens the Sage, who employs speech as sweet as lawful flavors and conduct as noble and pure, to transform the unvirtuous—just as merchants sell their goods, and people follow the good in turn. Hence the following passage.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"Sweet speech can be sold like merchandise.\"* Sweet speech alone can be sold in the marketplace. Truly, in market transactions, once the exchange is complete, there is no further harmony or goodness. Those who speak sweetly seek to obtain quickly, and those who sell seek to dispose of their goods quickly. *\"Noble conduct can surpass others.\"* *Surpass* here means to distinguish oneself. If one has noble conduct, it can set them apart from ordinary people, but this is still insufficient to uphold the Dao.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThose who embody the Dao forget about words; sincere words are not sweetened. Elaborate arguments that conceal falsehoods cannot truly grasp the real. Empty speech that loses substance—how could it be worthy of the Dao? Flowery words deceive the masses, adorn falsehood as truth, and idle theories confuse people, turning evil into good. Such speech may only be useful in the marketplace—how could it establish virtue and embrace the Dao?\n\nThose who attain the supreme Dao forget distinctions between self and others; those who awaken to nature merge into harmonious unity. How could one exalt oneself while belittling others, claim oneself while rejecting others, or place oneself above all things?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe unvirtuous have shallow hearts and actions, often speaking flatteringly and adorning their words with empty rhetoric, just like merchants in the marketplace vying for profit. Yet they cannot practice gentle humility, prioritize others, or humble themselves—only to then exalt their own conduct and domineer over others. Such are the unvirtuous; how distant they are from the Dao!\n\n**Secondly, it clarifies that the wise do not abandon the foolish, extending boundless compassion.**\n\nThough people may be unvirtuous, how could they be abandoned?\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nEven the unvirtuous are within the scope of transformation—how could they be cast aside?\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nIt says that though people’s speech and conduct may be unvirtuous, how could they be abandoned? One must guide them with the good Dao, hoping they will reform through transformation. It is not permissible to abandon them without instruction, hence the saying: *\"How could they be abandoned?\"*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThough people may be unvirtuous, they must be transformed through the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue and transformation were pure.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe Sage’s teachings are established to enlighten the ignorant. The wondrous Dao is vast and far-reaching, yet it is also perfected for those not yet awakened. It seeks to make both the virtuous and unvirtuous good, and both the knowing and ignorant wise. The Sage constantly rescues people—how could there be any abandonment?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*Deliberately*—why? The Sage’s enlightenment is profound and universal. Even if beings are unvirtuous, how could there be a heart of abandonment? It reveals boundless compassion, covering and aiding all without exception.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Ministers are appointed.\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nTo instruct the unvirtuous.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThe Three Ministers refer to the Grand Teacher, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian. The Son of Heaven governs without action, while the Three Ministers discuss the Dao, all serving as models to establish teachings and transform the unvirtuous. As the *Book of Documents* says: *\"Heaven’s work is continued by humanity\"*—this is what is meant.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nTo transform the unvirtuous through instruction.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nIn the most ancient times, the wise and foolish were equal, their bodies not straying from the Dao, their actions in harmony with nature—all treasured the Dao. But from the Three Dynasties onward, things grew corrupt. Without a ruler to guide people, and with a sovereign to transform them, the upper echelons established the *Wenhui* (literally, \"cultural harmony\") system, while below, officials were appointed to discuss the Dao. They demonstrated good and evil, admonished with rites and laws, transforming the unvirtuous and cultivating pure customs.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nSince the Sage’s enlightenment covers all without exception, it is fitting to establish methods to aid the world. Thus, the Son of Heaven is established to govern all affairs, and the Three Ministers are appointed to discuss the Dao. They regulate yin and yang, refine governance, and intend to guide all beings, protecting them from harm.\n\nSince the opening of creation, true sovereigns have appeared in the world—all embodying the Dao’s adaptive responses as emperors and kings, thus symbolizing the Three Pure Ones and establishing their officials.\n\n**Thirdly, it weighs benefits and harms to clarify victory and defeat.**\n\nEven with a *hongbi* (a large jade tablet) presented ahead of four horses, it is not as good as submitting to this Dao while seated.\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nThough the Three Ministers assist with offerings—even a *hongbi* jade tablet and four fine horses presented first—it is still not as precious as submitting to this Dao of *wuwei* to the sovereign for transforming people.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nA *hongbi* is a large jade tablet; four horses are the finest steeds. It says that though the Three Ministers, as ministers, present such treasures to the sovereign, they are still not as valuable as submitting the Dao of *wuwei* to transform evil into good.\n\nThe *hongbi* precedes the four horses because, in ancient tribute missions, one would first present the four horses, with the jade tablet as a guide—hence *\"preceding.\"* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *\"Driving a chariot with leather fittings and twelve oxen to reward the army\"*—this is the same.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nEven if one arrives with a *hongbi* and four horses, it is still not as good as submitting to this Dao.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nIn ancient times, reclusive scholars would first present a jade tablet, then a horse—hence *\"preceding the four horses.\"* Those who invert right and wrong must be exposed with their deceits; those who cling to folly must be illuminated by wisdom’s torch.\n\nTo serve as the sovereign’s inner counsel and the ruler’s pillars of support—this is to rectify their evil and aid in propagating teachings.\n\n「Yet those who value fame are not content with their station, recklessly aspiring to honors beyond their merit. Those who crave favor do not follow the Dao but only seek lofty titles. By indulging in arrogance and extravagance, they invite misfortune upon themselves, ultimately facing ruin—far worse than cultivating the supreme Dao, where neither favor nor disgrace can perturb.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe *hongbi* (拱璧) is the *hongbi* (拱把) jade tablet—when presenting a whole, round tablet, one must first fast and bow in reverence. Only then does one send the four horses. Though one may attain wealth and honor through a grandly adorned jade tablet, it is still inferior to the effortless practice of *zuowang* (坐忘), refining oneself in this Dao. Why so? For cultivating the Dao brings eternal life, while wealth and honor are but fleeting breaths. Hence, **Master Guangchengzi** (广成子) says:\n*\"Life in the world is like a cloud soaring in the sky—\nits form dissolves in an instant.\nTo measure it thus, nothing surpasses distance.\"*\n\n○ **Fourth Hypothesis and Admiration of Dao’s Power:**\nWhy was the Dao held in such esteem in antiquity?\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"Why\"* (何) here is a question word.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nTo cite ancient examples and prove their relevance today, inspiring trust in all things.\nThe ancients were the same as those who cherished the Dao and practiced virtue.\nWhy did they hold the Dao in such high regard?\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\nIn antiquity, the Dao was prized because one need not travel far to seek it—it is found within oneself.\n\n○ **Master Rong says:**\nFrom ancient times to the present, what does it mean to hold the Dao in such high regard?\nOne does not seek it for a single day and yet obtains it,\npracticing it to avoid calamities for a hundred years,\nensuring blessings and longevity while severing ties with danger and ruin.\nThus, the ancients and the present alike revered it,\nand all under Heaven and the gods cherish it universally.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nIt speaks of why the sages of old treasured the Dao so deeply.\nIt is because one does not need to spend a day seeking it before attaining it—\nthis refers to those who awaken and perceive the Dao immediately,\nwhile the deluded may wander countless kalpas without comprehension.\nEven if since beginningless time,\none has been bound by the cycles of birth and death,\nand by sin and suffering—\nshould one attain it, one may instantly return to the source,\nfreeing oneself from all burdens.\nSuch divine power is beyond imagination,\nhence the Dao is revered by all under Heaven.\n\nIs it not because one does not need to seek it daily before attaining it?\nAnd because one’s sins are pardoned?\nThus, the Dao is held in highest esteem.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nThe Dao lies in awakening, not in seeking.\nUnlike wealth and goods, which can be sought daily and obtained,\nthe Dao is not attained through daily effort.\nAwakening means no sins accumulate—\nthis is why it is held in highest esteem.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nThis explains why the Dao is cherished.\n*\"One does not need to seek it daily before attaining it\"*—\nthe Dao lies in awakening,\nand awakening is the clarity of the mind,\nnot like the active methods of the world,\nwhich require years of accumulation and striving to achieve.\nBut if one clears the heart and extinguishes desire,\npurity arises naturally.\nThus, *\"one does not need to seek it daily before attaining it.\"*\n\n*\"And because one’s sins are pardoned?\"*—\nWhen the mind is lost in delusion and defilement,\nthe burden of karma arises.\nBut if one awakens to the Dao and embraces emptiness,\nthe causes of sin perish on their own.\nHow can this compare to those who cling to rigid attachments,\nwhose every action spawns regret and remorse,\nwho are ensnared by guilt and punishment yet still seek release?\nFor this reason alone,\nthe Dao is treasured by all virtuous men.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"And because one’s sins are pardoned\"*—\nthose who commit sin are those who face turbulent times and tyrannical rulers,\nwho rashly impose punishments.\nYet cultivating the Dao can dissolve death itself,\nfreeing one from all suffering.\nThus, the Dao is held in highest esteem,\nfor its virtue and power permeate all things,\npreserving life and governing the realm with effortless harmony.\nHence, it is revered by all under Heaven.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Three: The Method of *Wuwei* (無為)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor the earlier chapter expounded the righteousness of urging all to return to the Dao,\nwhereby one’s sins are pardoned.\nThus, this chapter illustrates the method of returning to the Dao,\nand the means of absolving sin.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:\nThe first clarifies that action does not contradict stillness—\nthis is the method of returning to the Dao.\nThe second demonstrates how to subdue the initial deluded mind—\nthis is the safeguard against sin.\nThe third warns against trivializing the words of the sages,\nto aid those who seek cultivation.\n\n**First: Action Does Not Contradict Stillness—The Method of Returning to the Dao.**\nThe Dao’s nature is profound and subtle,\nits essence and principle both serene.\nThe true gate is hidden and deep,\nits traces elusive beyond sound and color.\nIn the boundless void of great confusion,\none may doubt and follow external influences,\nyet such deeds shock the world and cannot endure.\nHow much better to act without acting,\nto strike thunderous drums yet leave no sound,\nto move beyond all measure!\n\nLight promises and few trustworthy words,\nexcessive speech and inevitable exhaustion—\nthe sage faces no difficulty,\nfor in a single breath, all is achieved.\nThe *He Shangzi* ascended into the void,\nrising a hundred zhang without fear.\nEmperor Wen of Han awoke early,\nhis frugal halls and curtains brought prosperity to the state.\nEmperor Qin of Qin fell into delusion,\nhis extravagant Alang Palace led to the nation’s destruction.\nThese words are heard in the ears—\nshould they not be heeded?\n\n**Master Laozi** (老君) despises this superficial flurry,\nurging gradual refinement instead.\nThus, one knows to respond to grievances with virtue,\nfor the most saintly sages discern the weight of great and small.\nThis is no idle talk.\n\nTo act without acting,\nto do without doing,\nto savor without savoring—\ngreat or small, much or little,\none pardons grievances with virtue,\ntranscending the distinctions of acting or not acting,\nof doing or not doing,\nof savoring or not savoring.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"To act without acting\"* (為無為),\n*\"to do without doing\"* (事無事),\nand *\"to savor without savoring\"* (味無味)—\nwhether great or small, much or little,\none does not exceed one’s portion,\nnor does one harbor resentment.\nIf one follows the senses and generates the mind,\ntransgressing boundaries and harming one’s nature,\nthen neither great nor small remains—\nall become objects of grievance.\nNow, having guarded one’s portion,\none preserves harmony through virtue.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"To act\"* (為) means to create and shape.\nThose who cultivate the Dao practice *zuowang* (坐忘) and abandon desire,\ntheir minds free from contrivance.\nWhatever they set in motion,\ntheir deeds and transformations are effortless—\nthus, *\"without acting\"* (無為).\nThis clarifies the mind.\n\nThey are not hindered by affairs,\nso *\"without doing\"* (無事) in matters—\nthis clarifies the body.\n\nThey do not linger in tastes,\nso *\"without savoring\"* (無味) in flavors—\nthis clarifies the tongue.\n\nWhen the three actions are still,\nthe six senses naturally cease.\nThus, *\"without acting\"* (無為),\n*\"without doing\"* (無事),\nand *\"without savoring\"* (無味).\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"To act without acting\"*—\none refines cultivation, hence creates nothing.\n*\"To do without doing\"*—\none prepares in advance,\nremoving distractions and simplifying affairs.\n\n「Without savoring, one delves into profound contemplation and distant foresight, thus discerning the Dao and its intent.\n\n○ **Master Rong says:**\nTo still the restless agitation,\nto concentrate the spirit in tranquility,\nto sever entanglements of affairs,\nto empty oneself in naturalness,\nand to abandon cravings,\nlingering in the ineffable and mysterious.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**\n*\"To act without acting\"*—\none attains subtle accord with the heart’s origin,\nnot losing the true reflection,\nand the reflection penetrates all deeds—\nthus, *\"to act without acting\"* is also *\"to act without acting\"* (無為則為，為則無為).\n*\"To do without doing\"*—\naffairs refer to all sensory and material realms,\nthe myriad things.\nOne attains the subtle essence of the true Dao,\nand the reflection does not stray from emptiness—\nthough one engages in affairs,\none remains in *having-in-emptiness* (有體空),\ninternally reflecting while without the mind,\nexternally engaging while without affairs.\n\n*\"Without savoring\"*—\nto savor means to be stained and attached.\nWhen both root and dust (尘) are empty,\nand the faculties and objects are quiescent,\nthough one still seeks attachment,\nthere is no clinging.\n\nGreat and small, much and little,\none repays resentment with virtue.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\nGreat and small, much and little—\nthese are the precepts and prohibitions laid out.\nDesire great, it turns to small;\ndesire much, it turns to little—\nthis is the natural Dao.\nTo repay resentment with virtue—\nto cultivate the Dao and practice goodness,\ncutting off calamities before they arise.\n\n○ **Master Rong says:**\nResentment arises,\nsometimes great, sometimes small.\nHatred springs forth,\nnow few, now many.\nWhen one enters realms of affairs,\none is ensnared by burdens,\nand resentment begets resentment,\nendless in its cycle.\nIf one returns to the great Dao of *without acting*,\npreserving the naturalness of *without burden*,\ndiscarding all that is turbid and mixed,\nsavoring this purity and emptiness,\nthen blame does not arise,\nand resentment and enmity do not take root—\nthis is to repay resentment with virtue.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nResentment—\nthe fault and its counterpart.\nRepayment—\nto settle with enmity.\nFrom beginningless time onward,\ngreat and small faults,\nmany and few deeds—\nto utterly extinguish them all\nand repay with a single act of completion,\none must first apply the three virtues of *without acting*, *without doing*, and *without savoring*\nto observe the mind.\nThen the Three Worlds are empty,\nall dharmas pure and clear,\nsubject and object merge in obscurity—\nwhat counterpart remains?\nThus, the previous chapter says:\n*\"Is there any fault that cannot be freed?\"*\nThis is what it means.\n\nThe second precept clarifies the taming of the initial heart,\nwhich is the defense against faults.\nTo forestall difficulty at its ease,\nto make greatness from the small.\n○ **Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:**\nThose who indulge in emotions and desires\nfind no deed without difficulty,\nno affair without greatness.\nNow, if one seeks to overcome these difficulties,\nto prepare for greatness,\none must do so when nature is still undispersed,\nand the boundaries are yet uncrossed—\nthen one finds ease in the small.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:**\nTo forestall—\nto measure and overcome.\nTo prepare—\nto undertake.\nEmotional desires harm nature,\nall arising gradually.\nThere is no deed that does not begin in ease\nand end in difficulty,\nno affair that does not start small\nand grow great.\nIf one seeks to overcome difficulty\nwhen it has already become difficult,\nor to prepare for greatness\nwhen it has already become great,\nthen calamities have already taken form—\neven if one strives to overcome or prepare,\nit will be of no benefit to the affliction.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\nTo forestall difficulty at its ease—\nwhen one seeks to overcome difficult matters,\none must act before they reach their ease, before they become fully formed.\nTo prepare greatness from the small—\nwhen one seeks to undertake great affairs,\none must first avert the small calamities.\nFor great evils arise from small.\n\n○ **Master Rong says:**\nTo forestall difficulty at its ease,\nto prepare greatness from the small—\nthe world’s difficult affairs also arise from ease,\nand great affairs also arise from small.\nTo arise—\nto emerge.\nAffairs emerge,\nfrom ease they become difficult,\nfrom small they grow great.\nTo remove evil retribution,\none must first still the initial heart.\nTo eliminate great evils,\none must first break them at their small beginnings—\nif the roots are cut,\nthe branches and leaves will naturally wither.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nTo forestall difficulty at its ease—\nto forestall means to plan and overcome.\nDifficulty—\nthe retribution of faults.\nEase—\nthe initial heart.\nTo plan and overcome the hardships of evil paths,\none must observe the initial heart—\nwhen the heart is without contrivance,\nthen there is no retribution.\nTo prepare greatness from the small—\nsmall means minute.\nTo create great calamities,\none must first attend to the trivial.\nThis clarifies that to extinguish evil fruits,\none must first dispel their causes.\n\nThe world’s difficult affairs must arise from ease.\nThe world’s great affairs must arise from small.\n○ **Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:**\nThis elucidates the reason for the earlier admonition to plan and prepare.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nTo arise—\nto emerge.\nThis reiterates the source of the earlier calamities and difficulties—\ndifficult affairs emerge from ease,\nso one must plan to overcome them while they are still easy.\nGreat affairs also emerge from small,\nso one must eliminate them while they are still small.\nThe instances are endless,\nso they are summarized below.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\nModesty in conduct.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nTo arise—\nto emerge.\nThe world’s hardships and retributions of faults\nmust all emerge from the initial heart—\na single thought of the initial heart\ncan create immense deeds.\nThus, one must carefully consider:\ngreat calamities arise from small beginnings,\nfrom subtle to manifest,\ngradually forming vast burdens.\nTherefore, to remove evil retribution,\none must first restrain the initial heart.\n\nThe third precept warns against casually invoking sacred teachings,\nlest they hinder those who seek cultivation.\nThus, the Sage never undertakes greatness,\nand so is able to achieve greatness.\n○ **Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:**\nSince it is said that great affairs arise from small,\nthis explains why the Sage can achieve greatness—\nby not undertaking difficult or great affairs,\nthe Sage attains their true grandeur.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:**\nThe earlier passage shows that ordinary people,\nwhen they undertake difficult or great affairs,\noften fail and face many calamities.\nThus, the Sage never undertakes difficult or great affairs,\nand so is able to achieve true grandeur.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe world unites in this.\n\n「Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:\nTo make light promises and grant them to others,\none must necessarily lack in trustworthiness.\nTo act hastily and without restraint,\none will inevitably face many difficulties later.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:\nThis serves as a concluding metaphor.\nHe who does not deliberate three times before speaking,\nwho makes light and hasty promises,\nlacks loyalty and sincerity.\nHe who does not plan the beginning yet is cautious at the end,\nwho undertakes affairs with excessive ease,\nwill later give rise to difficulties and become burdened with calamities.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong says:\nTo make light promises is to lack trustworthiness—\nit is to take words lightly.\nTo act hastily is to invite many difficulties—\nit is to fail in caution against misfortune.\n\n○ Master Rong says:\nOnce a word is spoken, it must be kept true;\nlight promises are merely hollow.\nDifficulties arise from what one undertakes,\nand all sins and retributions in this life and the next\nare made easy by such frivolity.\nTo engage in unrighteous deeds,\nboth beginning and end will bring hardship.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s commentary:\nTo make light promises indeed leads to a lack of trustworthiness—\nthis is a metaphor of contrast.\n*\"诺\"* (promise) means *\"然许\"* (to affirm and agree).\n*\"寡\"* (lack) means *\"少\"* (few).\nHe who makes light and hasty promises to others\nwill necessarily be few in sincerity,\nand thus failing in trustworthiness brings the blame of *\"寡信\"* (lacking trust).\nTo act hastily and affirm promises is also like\ncommitting sins lightly, inviting the calamity of the *\"八难\"* (Eight Sufferings).\nTherefore, those who cultivate the Dao must be steadfast,\nnever lighthearted.\nHence, the Sage finds even such matters difficult,\nand so never encounters great difficulty.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:\nDifficulties arise from light promises and hasty actions,\nso the Sage never faces great difficulty.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:\nThe Sage is the ruler who embodies the Dao.\nHe finds even light promises and hasty actions difficult—\nhow much more so for those who are not Sages?\nThe Sage finds light promises and hasty actions difficult,\nand so never encounters great difficulty.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong says:\nThus, the Sage finds even action and affairs difficult—\nhe weighs progress and retreat with great deliberation,\nseeking to block the source of calamities,\nand so never encounters great difficulty.\nThe Sage’s entire life is free from misfortune,\nbecause he avoids harm with profound caution.\n\n○ Master Rong says:\nLightly undertaking evil deeds,\nacting without restraint invites sinful causes.\nThe Sage, being wise and discerning,\nstill finds even righteous action difficult,\nand so attains both beginning and end without difficulty.\nHow much less can those who are blind and ignorant,\nunable to weigh and be cautious,\nhope to escape misfortune and calamity?\n\n○ Master Cheng’s commentary:\n*\"犹\"* (still) means *\"尚\"* (yet).\nThe Sage who embodies the Dao truly knows no difficulty or ease,\nyet he still finds sinful deeds difficult to commit,\nand so avoids blame for rashness.\nHow much more so for the common folk,\nwho indulge their emotions without restraint?\n\nThis is the concluding precept for the common cultivation of the Sage.\nHence, Guo Xiang’s annotation on the *Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"The Sage, though entering fire, does not feel its heat,\nyet never steps into the fire.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"To keep far from fire is not to flee the heat—\nthis is the very meaning.\"*\n\n*Dao De Jing: Xuan De Mu Chu* (Mysterious Virtue Commentary) Volume XVI concludes.\n*Dao De Jing: Zuan Chu* (Compiled Commentary) Volume XVII ends.\n\n**Chapter 64: *Its Ease in Holding Firm***\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one because, though the earlier passage clearly warns against the perils of sin, its guidance on practice remains incomplete. Thus, this chapter reiterates its meaning in four distinct ways: first, by teaching a method to subdue the initial mind; second, by offering an analogy to show how sin arises from subtle beginnings; third, by revealing how sentient beings, lost in delusion, stray from truth and lose their essence; and fourth, by citing the Sage’s example to demonstrate the path of learning.\n\n**First Method: Subduing the Initial Mind**\n\nThe earth remains unmoving—its *virtue* of *Kun* brings enduring stillness,\nMountains and peaks stand firm—deep roots anchor them forever.\n\nThose lost in the fourfold delusion’s realm,\nAbout to wander the fivefold turbid crossroads—\nNone can match the ease of holding firm what is already settled,\nFor what is subtle may yet be scattered.\n\nJust as a tree of ten *chi* grows from a hair’s tip,\nAnd a nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth,\nA thousand-*li* journey begins beneath the first step—\nWhat is small must grow great.\nThus, the roots of sin deepen gradually,\nAnd evil becomes transgression.\nLike layered towers expanding ever wider,\nOne must clear away the darkness of ignorance\nBefore venturing into the Dao’s profound realm.\nDo not be like Emperor Wu of Han, whose schemes failed,\nNor like one whose flesh is plentiful but marrow scarce,\nFailing to uphold Laozi’s precepts.\nA hollow belly and empty heart—\nEven wild grass proves too much to tame,\nLet alone the scattered currents of emotion and desire.\nOne must uproot them early,\nLest they spread unchecked,\nAnd thus align with the natural order of all things,\nIn harmony with the Dao of eternal life.\n\n**Its Ease in Holding Firm**\n*Imperial Commentary*: \"Its ease in holding firm\" means \"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen.\" When a person’s true nature is serene and still, and one seeks to grasp and hold it—before desire even stirs, before its signs appear—one can plan to cut it off, ensuring it never arises. This is what is meant by \"ease.\"\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *An* (安) means *stillness*; *chi* (持) means *to grasp*. When a person’s innate nature is pure and untouched by external influences, yet stirred by sensory objects into boundless craving, now we clarify that in the moment before desire arises—when the mind is still and unscattered—it is easy to grasp and hold. Hence, *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n*River-Upper Master (严君平)*: Governing the body and the state—what is serene is easy to uphold.\n\n*Li Rong* (李荣): *\"Its ease in holding firm\"* and *\"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen\"*—*an* (安) means *stillness*; *wei zhao* (未兆) means *the stirrings have not yet formed*. It is difficult to stop calamity and evil once they manifest, but if one seeks to remove evil, one must act before it stirs. If one seeks to prevent disaster, one must hold firm in stillness. When evil’s signs have not yet appeared, there is no need to plot—disaster will not arise naturally. This is what is called the conduct of the superior sage in preventing calamity.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *An* (安) means *stillness*. For those cultivating the Dao, when the mind is tranquil and no thoughts have yet arisen, this is the most opportune time for cultivation and guard.\n\n**Its Ease in Preventing What Has Not Yet Arisen**\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *Zhao* (兆) means *sprouting, emerging*; *mou* (谋) means *to plan*. When desire is about to arise but has not yet taken form, planning to cut it off is also very easy. Hence, *\"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen.\"*\n\n*River-Upper Master*: When the signs of desire and calamity have not yet appeared, it is easy to plan their cessation.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *Zhao* (兆) means *form, manifestation*; *mou* (谋) means *to devise*. Even if the mind has stirred but not yet grasped the object, and no form has yet appeared in the senses, one must immediately withdraw the mind to stillness. Since the deed has not yet been completed, it is easy to plan and consider.\n\n**Its Fragility, Easy to Shatter**\n*Imperial Commentary*: *\"Its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse\"*—when desire first takes root, it is still weak and fragile. Those who can sever it find it easy to break, for when calamity first stirs, its signs are still faint. If one seeks to prevent it, its subtlety makes it easy to disperse.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: When desire has already stirred but is still soft and not yet hardened, to remove it is easy to dissolve and break.\n\n*River-Upper Master*: When calamity has not yet sprouted and desire has not yet taken form, it is like something fragile and easy to remove.\n\n*Li Rong*: *\"Its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse\"*—when sin is minor, it is easy to extinguish; when evil grows, it is hard to remove. If one cannot prevent it before it stirs, one must restrain it in its fragility and subtlety. This is the conduct of the middle sage in eliminating and dispersing evil.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *\"Its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse\"*—*cui* (脆) means *hollow, like a gourd’s unripe fruit, soft and easy to break*. When the initial mind first stirs, it is just so: the karmic seeds are still shallow, hence easy to disperse.\n\n**Its Subtlety, Easy to Disperse**\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *Wei* (微) means *subtle*. When calamity first stirs faintly, before it grows great, preventing it at its origin makes it easy to disperse.\n\n*River-Upper Master*: When the matter has not yet become apparent, what is subtle is easy to disperse.\n\n**Act Before It Exists**\n*Imperial Commentary*: The reason holding firm and preventing what has not yet arisen is easy is that one must cultivate and remove it *before* it takes form.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *Wei* (为) means *to cultivate and remove*. This sentence explains the two preceding ones—*\"its ease in holding firm\"* and *\"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen.\"* The meaning is: when desire has not yet arisen, one must cultivate and cut it off, ensuring evil does not take root. Hence, *\"act before it exists.\"*\n\n*River-Upper Master*: If one seeks to act, one must block its sprouting at the very beginning.\n\n*Li Rong*: This is what is meant by *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *Wei* (为) means *to cultivate and practice*. For those on the path, cultivation and guard must begin *before* defilement arises. This explains *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n**Prevent Before It Becomes Chaos**\n*Imperial Commentary*: This follows *\"its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse.\"* The reason it is easy is that one must remove it *before* it becomes calamity and chaos.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: This sentence explains the two preceding ones—*\"its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse.\"* The reason it is easy is that even if desire has arisen, it is still fragile and subtle, not yet having become calamity and chaos, hence easy to rectify.\n\n「**River Master Cheng** said: In governing oneself and governing the realm, when chaos has not yet arisen, one must *preemptively close its gate*.\n\n**Li Rong** said: This is what is meant by *\"its fragility, easy to shatter.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *Chaos* refers to the entanglement of afflictions—when one is already ensnared by karmic bonds, the mind becomes obscured and disordered. Now, though the mind may arise and be defiled by external objects, it has not yet reached the point where it must be addressed, making it easy to govern. This explains *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse.\"*\n\n**Prevent Before It Becomes Chaos**\n**The Way of Rectification Begins in the Unmanifest**\n**River Master Cheng** said: A tree thick enough to encircle with one’s arms begins as a tiny sprout; a nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth; a journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step. This is what is meant by *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The tree that grows to be encircled by arms originates from a single hair’s width of a sprout—this illustrates how the three paths of defilement arise from a single thought. The reason a tree is used as an analogy is that, from small to great, it can eventually block the sunlight, just as the defilement of the mind, from subtle to deep-rooted, can obscure one’s true nature. If one considers this tree as arising from emptiness—speaking of emptiness, the tree itself is not inherently existent—it is because the four dusts of sense perception do not solidify into form.\n\nAfflictions, too, arise from emptiness—speaking of emptiness, they are not inherently existent. The nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth—just as a tower of nine levels begins with a single basket of soil, so the calamity of the nine nights of suffering originates from a single defiled thought. This admonishes all learners to guard against negligence with utmost caution.\n\nA peak a hundred *ren* high begins with a single step—since seven *chi* make one *ren*, a mountain peak a hundred *ren* tall starts from the first step. The suffering of the eightfold path arises from the defilement of the mind. The analogy of the nine-tiered tower illustrates that afflictions have already taken root, while the hundred *ren* peak further warns that even greater calamity awaits if the defilement continues unchecked.\n\n**The Third Analogy Clarifies the Delusion of Sentient Beings**\n**Those Who Act Are Doomed to Fail; Those Who Cling Are Doomed to Lose**\n**River Master Cheng** said: Those who act are doomed to fail—if one acts upon external matters, one abandons natural spontaneity; if one acts upon moral principles, one abandons virtue; if one acts upon sensory pleasures, one abandons clarity of mind.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The supreme Dao is void and profound, requiring neither action nor attachment. Yet ordinary minds are inverted, clinging to action and attachment, which bring peril and ruin. Hence, it is said that *\"those who act are doomed to fail\"*—because attachment goes against reality, it is said that *\"those who cling are doomed to lose.\"*\n\n**The Fourth Section Cites the Sage to Validate the Teaching**\nThus, the Sage acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no failure; the Sage does not cling, hence there is no loss.\n\n**The Sage’s Natural Way**\n**River Master Cheng** said: The Sage acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no failure. The Sage does not adorn with empty rhetoric, hence there is no failure. The Sage does not indulge in sensory pleasures, hence there is no depletion. The Sage does not cling, hence there is no loss. The Sage possesses virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor, yet retains nothing for oneself, hence there is nothing lost to others.\n\n**Li Rong** said: Ordinary people are blind to immediate matters, hence they incur failures and losses. The Sage, however, perceives the unseen before its manifestation and thus avoids the perils of action.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The Sage embodies the Dao and acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no obstruction or failure. The Sage does not cling to illusions, hence does not lose their true nature. Ordinary people, when engaging in good deeds, often falter when success is near—greedy for status, fond of reputation, indulgent in luxury, and complacent in abundance—thus bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: *From* (从) means *to act* (为). When ordinary people pursue affairs, they often nearly achieve their moral merits but then, through greed for position and love of fame, through extravagance and arrogance, through indulgence and fullness, bring ruin upon themselves.\n\n「**Master Róng** said: *几* (near) means *near completion*. Ordinary people, when doing evil, cannot remove it early; when evil deeds are nearly complete, they naturally self-destruct. If one could align with the Sage, abandoning danger and seeking safety, they would never commit wrongdoing, nor incur blame, and thus would neither gain nor lose—what ruin or success could there be?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *几* (near) means *near completion*. Ordinary people cling to affairs of action (*youwei*), their minds restless and competitive, clinging to distinctions and grasping at gains—utterly lacking foresight. They always wish for near completion, yet have beginnings without endings, hence their frequent failures. The *Book of Songs* says: *\"None lack a beginning, few attain to the end.\"* To be cautious at the end as at the start ensures no ruinous affairs.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: To be cautious at the end as at the start, maintaining unwavering constancy, then there will be no failed undertakings.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis**: This is the Elder Master’s reiteration of his admonition. If a person can be cautious at the end as at the beginning, steadfast from start to finish, then there will be no failed undertakings.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: The end should be like the beginning; one must not slacken.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: This admonishes studious people to fortify their resolve, maintaining steadfastness from start to finish—how could there be failure? Among the Six Perfections (*liùdù*), this is the fourth: *renunciation* (*zìxìng*). Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, and does not value difficult-to-obtain wealth.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: Difficult-to-obtain wealth refers to what lies beyond one’s natural inclinations. Now, the Sage, in not desiring to desire, does not pursue what is beyond their nature, always preserving their spontaneity—this is not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: This illustrates the Sage’s conduct to repudiate the common. Difficult-to-obtain wealth—internally refers to what is beyond one’s natural inclinations, externally refers to pearls, rhinoceros horns, and treasures. The Sage, in not desiring to desire, neither internally pursues what is beyond their nature nor externally seeks wealth that burdens their virtue.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire: the Sage desires what others do not desire—others seek fame and display, the Sage desires obscurity; others desire ornamentation, the Sage desires simplicity; others value outward appearance, the Sage values inner virtue. The Sage does not covet difficult-to-obtain wealth, hence does not dazzle with gaudy attire nor demean stone while venerating jade.\n\n**Master Róng** said: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth; they study without studying, anticipating the faults of others. Ordinary emotions follow desires, demeaning the Dao while valuing wealth. The Sage is not greedy, cherishing truth while lightly esteeming treasures. If one cultivates not for self but for others, studies not for personal gain but for the benefit of others, then avarice brings misfortune, and striving for fame invites censure. The Sage, without desire, abandons worldly gain; ceasing study, they forget fame. They do not flaunt their own abilities but guard against the faults of others.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth; they study without studying, correcting the faults of others. The Sage’s illumination comes from the heavens, differing from common wisdom; they perceive all phenomena as empty and illusory, seeing no objects worth praising. Thus, within desire, they do not perceive desire’s form—since they do not desire to desire, why would they value jade and silk?\n\nAgain, they grasp the truth of reality without distinction, hence they forget study. To study is not to study; not to study is to study. Studying differs from not studying; not studying differs from studying. Hence the *Sūtra of the Western Ascension* (*Xīshēng Jīng*) says: *\"My learning has no learning; only then can I illuminate nature.\"*\n\nTo anticipate, means to prevent. Ordinary people cling rigidly to affairs of action, unable to forget study, hence the Sage speaks of \"studying without studying\" to prevent the faults of all beings.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: \"Studying without studying\" corrects the faults of others, aiding the spontaneous nature of all things without daring to act. The Sage does not seek excessive learning, hence in \"studying without studying,\" they aim to return others’ excessive learning to its roots, aiding nature’s inherent essence, thus not daring to indulge in worldly desires or common studies.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The common folk value difficult-to-obtain wealth, hence they feign cleverness and flaunt their attainments, studying what lies beyond their natural inclinations. The Sage does not seek excessive learning, always preserving nature’s inherent essence—this is \"studying without studying,\" returning others’ excessive learning to its roots.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: \"Studying without studying\"—the Sage studies what others cannot study. Others study deceit and cunning; the Sage studies nature. Others study governance of the world; the Sage studies self-cultivation, guarding the true Dao.\n\nTo correct the faults of others—ordinary people study what is superficial, taking the end as the beginning. The superficial is indeed the ornament. To correct means to return to the root.\n\nTo aid the spontaneous nature of all things without daring to act—\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: To aid means to assist and guide. Nature is the inherent essence of things. All beings, deluded and misguided, lose their original essence. The Sage, with compassionate persuasion, encourages study without action, intending to assist and guide the true nature of things. Thus, they do not dare to act in worldly studies or excessive desires.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: To aid the spontaneous nature of all things, teaching people to return to reality—this is to assist the inherent essence of all things. Yet they do not dare to act. The Sage’s movements follow naturally, never daring to contrive, lest they stray from the root.\n\n**Master Róng** said: The nature of things is rooted in spontaneity. Desires corrupt with attachment, burdening truth; study obstructs with distinctions, hindering the Dao. Thus, the source of unity is obscured, and the true nature of the Way becomes difficult to discern. Without entering *wuwei*, one only returns to ruin. The Sage follows nature’s inherent essence, aids all things to preserve truth, never daring to act in contrived affairs, guiding them to return to emptiness and stillness.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: To aid means to assist and guide. All beings inherently possess nature’s upright essence, yet they are deluded and misguided, losing the Dao and abandoning truth. Now, the Sage seeks to uphold the method of \"studying without studying,\" guiding them to return to their roots. Though the Sage exhausts principles and fathoms nature, they also act without contrivance and without failing to act.»\n\n「Now, when it is said that the Sage does not act, it is because they also wish to assist and guide the multitude, restoring them to nature’s inherent essence. Hence, they say, *\"do not dare to act.\"*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Sage’s Skill in the Dao**\nThe reason for this chapter’s sequence after the previous is that the prior chapter spoke of the Sage abandoning study yet still able to assist and guide all beings. Therefore, this chapter follows to reveal those who practice study and engage in beneficent deeds—within this chapter, its meaning unfolds in three distinctions:\n1) To cite antiquity and validate the present, employing eloquent discourse to clarify;\n2) To discern excellence and mediocrity, setting forth models for emulation;\n3) To invert convention and align with truth, demonstrating its profound allure.\n\n1) **Citing Antiquity and Validating the Present, Employing Eloquent Discourse to Clarify**\nThe Dao’s profound origin is subtle, its mysteries reaching the utmost purity. It eludes the ears and eyes, rendering perception and hearing as ineffectual as those of a fool. Confucius uncovered it yet remained unaware, Yan Hui conversed with it yet failed to grasp. Thus, governing with wisdom is like the harm of thieves and bandits; cultivating the Dao with *wuwei* allows each to attain their own fulfillment. Is not this the standard form?\n\nThen one understands that the true source of emptiness and purity, its principles penetrating beyond tranquil oblivion, the profound mystery of the *Chongxuan* (重玄), transcends the causes of mere non-existence. It is not something that can be imparted through mere exposition, nor is it within the grasp of those lost in error. The affairs of human conduct are indeed perilous, hence it is said:\n*\"When the ditch of Cao Gou was dug, the people were enslaved;\nWhen Qin’s wealth was prized, its lineage fell into ruin.\nSoaring before gathering, the phoenix calls from the high ridges;\nRushing yet not flying, the magpie withdraws to distant paths.\nActing against the natural order leads to loss,\nDeparting from the Dao leads to destruction.\nIf one can reverse their conduct with things,\nThen they grasp the principle of great harmony.\"*\n\n**The Sage’s Skill in the Dao Lies Not in Enlightening the People, But in Making Them Seem Foolish**\n**Master He’s Commentary**: The ancient Sage-rulers, skilled in the Dao, valued *wuwei* and tranquil simplicity—not flaunting their methods to enlighten the people, but guiding them toward purity, closing off their cleverness to restore them to their original simplicity, making them appear as foolish as they truly were.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: The ancient Sage-rulers, who excelled in using the Dao for transformation, prized *wuwei* and tranquil simplicity. They did not display their methods to enlighten the people, lest cleverness and deceit flourish, but instead led them to purity and simplicity, making them appear as though they were foolish.\n\n**Master He Shangong said**: The ancient Sage-rulers, skilled in the Dao, spoke of those who used the Dao to cultivate their own bodies and govern their states. They did not enlighten the people with the Dao, nor did they teach them with cleverness, lest they become deceptive and cunning. Instead, they sought to make the people appear simple and unassuming, free from deceit and artifice.\n\n**Master Yan said**: The ancient Sage-rulers, guarding their own simplicity, made their subjects return to natural purity. Without resorting to coercive laws or punishments, the people naturally conformed to transformation. If they did not practice the Dao of emptiness and stillness, but instead relied solely on cunning and cleverness, the more intelligence there was, the greater the chaos. Hence, they were difficult to govern.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *治* (govern) is the same as *理* (transform). *智* (wisdom) refers to distinctions and discernments. The reason all beings are difficult to transform is that their minds are too occupied with distinctions, unable to embrace emptiness and stillness. Hence, they are hard to guide.\n\n2) **Discerning Excellence and Mediocrity, Setting Forth Models for Emulation**\nThus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state.\n**Master He’s Commentary**: *以* (to use) means to employ. When a ruler appoints clever and wise ministers to govern the state, their cleverness will inevitably lead to the creation of laws, and laws will breed deceit. Hence, it is said that wisdom is the thief of the state.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: *以* (to use) means to employ. *贼* (thief) refers to harm. When a ruler employs ministers who are cunning and deceitful to govern the state, their cleverness will give rise to schemes and stratagems. Once these schemes are put into use, falsehood and artifice will flourish, and the Dao will be abandoned, causing harm to the state. Hence, it is said that wisdom is the thief of the state.\n\n**Master He Shangong said**: If clever and wise individuals are entrusted with governing the state, they will inevitably stray from the Dao, arbitrarily imposing rewards and punishments, becoming the thieves of the state.\n\n**Master Yan said**: Thus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state. Not governing with wisdom is the virtue of the state. Cleverness and cunning deeply harm the people, making wisdom the thief of the state. Pure simplicity without cleverness, letting things transform naturally, each attending to their own affairs, the people finding joy in their lives and families secure, harming neither others nor themselves, ruler and subjects both at ease—this is the virtue of the state.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: Thus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state; not governing with wisdom is the virtue of the state. If one uses penetrating insight to govern with cleverness, they deviate from natural harmony and align with harm like a thief. The former is reversed, the latter is harmonious—how can such discourse be considered similar?\n\n**Response**:\nThe earlier statement of \"reversed\" means that it is not reversed but instead is truly reversed. The later statement of \"harmonious\" also means it is not harmonious but truly harmonious. If it is truly harmonious, it does not deviate from the reversed; if it is truly reversed, it does not deviate from the harmonious. What then is there to object to?»\n\n「The Sage asks: The Classic speaks of *Great Harmony*—does harmony also have degrees of greatness and smallness?\n\nThe Master responds: When harmony is opposed to defiance, it may be small. But now, neither defying nor harmonizing, yet it is called *not* harmonious—harmony does not differ from defiance, nor does defiance oppose harmony. Thus, the Classic speaks in silence, following only the Dao, blending with the light and merging with the dust, ever abiding in harmony with principle. Whether harmony or non-harmony, non-harmony or harmony, all are simultaneously harmonious. Hence, there is neither harmony nor non-harmony, nor is there a lack of harmony while still being able to lack non-harmony, nor even a negation of non-harmony—this is why it is called *Great Harmony*.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six of the *King of the Hundred Valleys***—\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which elucidates the *Mysterious Virtue* of the Sage, reversing the profane and aligning with the Dao. Thus, this chapter further expounds the practice of harmonizing with the Dao.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:\n1. **The Parable**—to demonstrate *emptiness and forgetfulness*,\n2. **The Doctrine**—to illuminate *humility and retreat*,\n3. **The Conclusion**—to praise the power of *softness and weakness*.\n\n**1. The Parable—Demonstrating Emptiness and Forgetfulness**\nThe eastward-flowing rivers all converge and pay homage to the great sea. Spring gives rise to all things, each shaping itself naturally. Why, then, does the sea possess emptiness, and the rivers descend? The sea, though not empty, is the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it abides in the low places.\n\nThe Sage uses this as an analogy: casting aside fame and desires, utterly forgetting right and wrong, embracing the multitude with boundless ease, illuminating the minute dust within the mind’s breadth—all actions are humble, all positions are yielding. Thus, the people and the heavens rejoice in their adoration, who could dare to contend?\n\nA lingering presence in the rear is not a boast of prowess; a snake’s foot, when added, spoils the whole. Yet if one were to snatch the wine first, they would know the *Mysterious Extremes* operate in secrecy. The Sage’s enduring stillness and retreat bring constant ease, while *firm and white* arguments are but empty noise—those who are blind to the end shall never comprehend.\n\n**Shared Work**—what strength did he possess? He shattered the Heavenly Pillar and brought calamity upon himself. **The Qin Emperor**—what folly did he commit? He pierced the earth for markets and invited disaster. Unable to embrace softness and enlighten the distant, they grew rigid and harsh—how could they know that their realm would crumble, their kin perish, their lives extinguished, and the world delivered into the hands of common men? Such is their dire fate.\n\nAs **Yang Xiong** said: This is because they did not practice emptiness.\n\nThe sea is able to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it excels in descending. Hence, the sea abides in low places, and all rivers pay homage to it, just as people flock to their king.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary**: The sea is able to command the rivers to converge and pay homage because it excels in dwelling in the lowest places, governing the currents.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: The sea, by dwelling in the lowest places, becomes the *King of the Hundred Valleys* to which all rivers pay homage. Thus, the *I Ching* says: *\"The Earthly Dao transforms fullness into flowing humility.\"* This is the parable given.\n\nThe Earthly Dao, through humility, receives the rivers’ tribute. The Sage, through humility, draws the people’s devotion—none weary of approaching.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says: The sea is able to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it excels in descending. Thus, the sea, through its lowliness, becomes the gathering place of all rivers. Just as people flock to their king, so the rivers pay homage to the sea. The sea’s ability to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* is due to its lowliness.\n\n**Master Rong** says: This parable shows that the sea, by dwelling in low places, becomes the *King of the Hundred Valleys*, illustrating that the Sage’s humility makes them the sovereign of all under Heaven.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *King* means *direction*. The *Hundred Valleys* are like the *Hundred Rivers*. The sea is called the *King of the Hundred Rivers* because it dwells in the low, sunken places. If a person retreats in body and humbles in speech, empties themselves and yields to all, they too shall be the refuge of the common folk—thus they become the *King of the Hundred Valleys*.\n\nThis concludes the parable’s meaning, hence the Classic says: *\"The sea is the King of the Hundred Rivers.\"*\n\n**2. The Doctrine—Illuminating Humility and Retreat**\nThus, the Sage desires to be above others by first humbling their speech.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary**: The Sage, desiring to be above others, humbles their speech. Desiring to precede others, they retreat their own body. Hence, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, others do not suffer harm. Humility is the handle of virtue—when one uses it, its brilliance only grows. By humbling their speech, the people joyfully submit; by retreating their body, the people willingly approach. Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, others do not suffer harm.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: This combines the parable. The Sage, desiring to be above others, humbles their speech. Does the Sage truly wish to dwell above others while humbling their speech? No—only the Sage knows that fullness invites loss, so they speak in humility and yield in name, descending below all things. Yet their vast virtue and grand achievements naturally elevate them above others.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says: The Sage, desiring to be above others, seeks to stand above the people. By humbling their speech, they follow the sea’s example, dwelling in humility.\n\n**Master Rong** says: The Sage, desiring to be above the people, humbles their speech. Desiring to precede the people, they retreat their body. Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, the people do not suffer harm. By dwelling humbly beneath all, their virtue draws them upward. By retreating to let others pass, their embrace of the Dao renders them without desire or action—utterly empty, utterly still, forgetting the heart and casting aside cleverness, corpse-like in silent mystery. Such is the governance of the world by the *Highest Virtue*.\n\nBy this standard, superiority and inferiority become evident. If governing the state is thus, then so too should one’s personal conduct be. Not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary**: If the ruler does not employ cunning ministers but instead seeks those of pure virtue, allowing them to rest in the Dao of non-action and practice the *Great Simplicity*, the natural harmony will flourish, and this is the state’s blessing.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: The ruler, not entrusting themselves to cunning ministers but seeking those of pure virtue, sits in the Dao of non-action and walks in the *Great Simplicity*, achieving harmony and ease—this is the state’s blessing.»\n\n**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**\nIf one does not allow the wise and clever to govern the state’s affairs, then the people will uphold uprightness, not indulging in deceit. The ruler and subjects will be close, and the sovereign and ministers will act in concert—this is the state’s blessing. Knowing these two principles is also the standard.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary:**\nTo employ cunning ministers brings harm to the people, while to entrust oneself to those of pure virtue brings blessing to the state. If the ruler knows these two principles and delegates to ministers of pure virtue, this becomes the standard and model.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis:**\nThe two principles refer to using wisdom and not using wisdom. The standard is the model, the law is the method. The ruler knows that using wisdom is like a thief, while not using it brings blessing—thus one must remove the thief and take the blessing. Only then can they be the standard and model for governing the state.\n\n**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**\nThe two principles refer to wisdom and lack of wisdom. Those who habitually know wisdom as a thief and lack of wisdom as a blessing are the standard and model for both personal cultivation and governing the state.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nKnowing these two principles is also the standard. Habitually knowing the standard is called *Highest Virtue*. *Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching, contrary to all things, and only then does one attain the *Great Order*.\n\nUsing wisdom or not using wisdom—these are the two. Using it brings harm; not using it brings no injury. If one knows that the people suffer no harm when not using wisdom, then one knows the standard and model for governing the state. Knowing the standard and model, one’s foundation is firm and the realm secure—this is the subtlety of virtue.\n\nThe subtlety of virtue is unfathomable and deepens daily; its pursuit is boundless and distant. All men use wisdom, yet this one alone uses simplicity, for he is contrary to all things.\n\nNot opposing the nature of things, but letting them unfold naturally—this is the *Great Order*.\n\nIt is also said that the Dao is originally empty and mysterious, while the worldly ways are coarse and defiled. To conform to the world and seek the Dao is to lose the true; to oppose the world and cultivate virtue is to enter the subtle. Entering the subtle, there is neither \"can\" nor \"cannot\"; returning to the true, there is neither \"blocked\" nor \"unblocked.\" Since its response is boundless and formless, it attains the *Great Order* and equality.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe two principles refer to the earlier discussion of wisdom and lack of wisdom. Those who use wisdom as a thief and lack of wisdom as virtue can serve as the standard for personal cultivation and the grand principles for governing the state. Habitually knowing the standard is called *Highest Virtue*.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary:**\n*Highest Virtue* is profound, subtle, and far-reaching. The ruler who habitually knows these two principles as the standard and model possesses the profound and mysterious subtlety of virtue.\n\n**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**\n*Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching. The person of *Highest Virtue* is profound beyond measure and distant beyond reach. Contrary to all things, the person of *Highest Virtue* opposes the world’s inclination to benefit oneself, instead desiring to aid others. Only then does one attain the *Great Order*, which aligns with the natural Way of Heaven.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching, contrary to the world—this is called *Highest Virtue*. To exhaust the source and reach the utmost is called profound and far-reaching. The profound and far-reaching wisdom is contrary to worldly ways, hence one is contrary to all things. Only then does one attain the *Great Order*, which has two forms: one, aligning with the natural principles; two, conforming to worldly affairs. The former harmonizes with the subtle source; the latter descends with the dust.\n\n**Question:** Earlier it says \"contrary to things,\" yet later it says \"aligning with worldly ways.\" If the text first says \"contrary\" and then \"aligning,\" how can they be consistent?\n\n**Answer:** The earlier \"contrary\" means contrary without being contrary; the later \"aligning\" means aligning without being aligning. Aligning without deviating from the contrary, and being contrary without breaking from alignment—what is there to object to?\n\n**Question:** The scripture speaks of *Great Order*—does \"order\" also have degrees of greatness and smallness?\n\n**Answer:** When \"order\" is contrasted with \"disorder,\" even if it is small, here it is neither aligning nor disordering, yet called \"not aligning.\" Aligning does not differ from disordering, nor does disordering conflict with aligning. Thus, in silent repose, one follows only the Dao, blending light with dust, and ever aligns with the natural principles. Whether called aligning or not aligning, not aligning or aligning, aligning or not aligning—all are aligning in their own time. Hence there is no aligning nor non-aligning, no non-aligning yet able to be non-aligning, nor is there a negation of non-aligning—this is why it is called *Great Order*.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (江海为百谷王)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded the person of *Highest Virtue*, contrary to the world yet aligning with the Dao. Thus, this chapter further displays the practice of aligning with the Dao.\n\nWithin this chapter, three themes unfold: first, an analogy to illustrate *emptiness-forgetting*; second, a teaching to demonstrate *humility-retreat*; third, a concluding reflection on the power of gentleness.\n\n**First: An Analogy to Illustrate *Emptiness-forgetting***\nThe eastern rivers all flow toward the sea, converging in their reverence for the great waters. In spring, all things arise, each taking shape in the natural Way. Why is it that the natural Way can be empty, and the great sea can be humble, so that the rivers may become its king?\n\nThe sage uses this as a metaphor: great dismissal of sounds and colors, complete forgetting of right and wrong. Welcoming the multitude with boundless harmony, illuminating the fine dust within the heart—wherever one goes, one is humble; wherever one stands, one is gentle and lowly. Then Heaven and man gladly acclaim, and who can dispute it?\n\n**First: An Analogy to Illustrate *Emptiness-forgetting***\nThe body, though placed behind, should not boast of its merit—like a serpent’s tail, it comes too late. When one seizes the wine and turns it upside down, one understands the profound subtleties of the Dao’s operations. In stillness and retreat, one finds enduring peace; the *firm-and-white* paradox is but idle chatter, and the mysteries of the end remain forever obscure.\n\nWhat power did Gonggong possess? He shattered the Heavenly Pillar and left ruin behind. What folly did the Qin Emperor exhibit? He pierced the earth for profit and invited disaster. Unable to embrace gentleness and illuminate the distant, they grew rigid and harsh. How could they know that their nation would crumble, their family perish, their bodies slaughtered, and their kin extinguished—casting the world into the hands of common men, how bitter their fate!\n\nAs Yang Xiong said, *\"It is not empty indeed.\"*\n\nThe reason the rivers and seas can reign as sovereigns over all valleys is that they excel in humility. Thus, the rivers and seas, through their lowly submission, become the *tributaries’ king*.\n\n**Annotations:**\n- *Emptiness-forgetting* (虚忘) / *humility-retreat* (谦退) / *firm-and-white* (坚白) / *tributaries’ king* (百谷王)\n\n**Second: A Teaching to Demonstrate *Humility-retreat***\nTherefore, the sage wishes to rise above others by speaking in humility. **Annotations:** *Humility-retreat* (谦退)\n\nThe *Commentary of the Master of the Riverbank* explains: Thus, the sage seeks to ascend above others by speaking in humility, and to lead them by placing himself behind. Hence, though he holds the highest position, others do not grow weary of him; though he stands at the forefront, none dare harm him. Humility is the handle of virtue, and nobility shines ever brighter. By speaking in humility, the people willingly follow, so he is not seen as burdensome in his elevation. By retreating in body, the people come as children, so he is not seen as a threat in his advance.\n\n**Annotations:**\n- *Master of the Riverbank* (河上公) / *handle of virtue* (德柄) / *nobility* (尊) / *bright* (光)\n\nThe *Grand Commentary* states: The sage does not truly wish to be above others; he merely embodies humility, placing himself behind while others advance. Thus, they naturally honor him as their leader.\n\nThe *Commentary of the Master of the Riverbank* further says: To rise above the people, the sage speaks in humility, following the model of the rivers and seas, dwelling in modesty.\n\nYang Xiong adds: Thus, the sage seeks to ascend above the people by speaking in humility, and to lead them by placing himself behind. Hence, though he holds the highest position, the people do not grow weary; though he stands at the forefront, the people are not harmed. He dwells beneath others with humility, yet his virtue earns him their elevation. He retreats in person to benefit others, yet his embrace of the Dao secures his revered place. The people willingly follow without feeling burdened, all loyal and filial—who would dare harm him?\n\nThe *Grand Commentary* elaborates: Though the sage stands above, the people do not grow weary because he is tranquil, unassuming, and free from excessive thought or desire. Thus, he governs as their ruler, easing their burdens and taxes so they labor lightly. Another interpretation: The sage’s benevolence extends to all things, so the people bear his rule without complaint.\n\nThough he stands at the forefront, the people are not harmed. As their sovereign, he places himself before them, yet they sing and strike the earth in joy, the world at peace. His benefits are vast and abundant, without harm. Another interpretation: The sage’s virtue is boundless, the people gladly acclaim him, cherishing his grace—how could they dare harm him?\n\n**Third: A Concluding Reflection on the Power of Gentleness**\nThus, the world willingly honors him without growing weary.\n\n**Commentary on the Gentle Sovereign’s Authority**\nBecause of his refusal to burden or harm, the world’s people willingly acclaim him as their sovereign without tiring.\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe Sage’s virtue is vast and boundless, nurturing all things like spring’s warmth, shining forth like the sun. Since he neither burdens nor harms, the people joyfully acclaim him without tiring.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nThe Sage’s kindness is profound and his love vast—he regards the people as his own children. Thus, the world willingly unites to honor him as sovereign, none wearying of him.\n\n**Master Rong’s Reflection:**\nTherefore, the world rejoices in acclaiming him without tiring, for he does not contend. Thus, none can contend with him. Those without virtue are universally despised, but those who embody the Way are all gladly honored. Practicing humility and yielding, he aligns with the transformations of all things—who would dare to contend with him?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nTherefore, the world rejoices in acclaiming him without tiring, for he does not contend. Thus, none can contend with him. The reason the people gladly honor him as their sovereign without tiring is that he is ever modest and yielding, never contending with others. Having abandoned strife and embraced equality, all distinctions of right and wrong cease—who would dare to contend with one who does not contend? Thus, none can contend with him. Because he does not contend, none can contend with him.\n\n**Commentary on the Sage’s Humility:**\nThe Sage is modest and retiring, not contending with others, so the world unites to honor him—who would dare to contend?\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe world rejoices in honoring the Sage without tiring, for his words place others above him, and his actions place himself behind them. Since he does not vie for precedence, none can contend with the Sage’s refusal to compete.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nBecause he does not contend, the world never tires of the Sage’s rule. This is because the Sage does not vie with others for precedence. Thus, none can contend with him. It is said that all people contend for action, but none contend with one who does not act.\n\n---\n**Chapter 67: On the Magnitude of the Dao**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded upon the Sage’s ability to be humble yet elevated. Thus, this chapter further elucidates his virtues and fully presents the Three Treasures.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning unfolds in five layers:\n1. He does not boast, so he is vast and great.\n2. He fully presents the Three Treasures, drawing all things to rely upon them.\n3. He reiterates the Three Treasures, praising their efficacy.\n4. He describes those who abandon the Three Treasures, sinking into death and life’s cycles.\n5. He concludes with a grand eulogy to boundless compassion and unparalleled virtue.\n\n**First Layer: He Does Not Boast, So He Is Vast and Great**\nThe profound and mysterious Dao originated before the Five Agents, and the subtle True Principle permeates the essence of the Original Harmony. Its form is vast, its virtue profound—transcending the laws of sensory desire and severing the boundaries of mundane perception. The common folk see only what is near, yet he does not defy the depths of the mysterious. Thus, though called \"great,\" he seems unremarkable. How could they know that the Three Treasures dwell in stillness, the True Vehicle daring not to lead? He ever guards humility and frugality.\n\nEven the sage-king Wen of Zhou, though wise, initially failed to grasp the Way of mutual benefit, and Emperor Wen of Han, though brilliant, did not comprehend the parable of the stacked firewood. How much less can the ordinary and vulgar, the coarse and mundane, fathom the profundity of the Mysterious Dao or grasp the depths of its Original Source? If they do not scorn it, how could it be called the Great Way?\n\nThe world says my Dao is great, yet it seems unremarkable.\n**Commentary:** *Xiào* (似) means \"to resemble.\"\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe world deems my Dao vast and boundless, yet it seems to resemble nothing. Thus, the following passage responds to this.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nThe Old Master says the world considers my Dao great, yet I feign ignorance, appearing unremarkable.\n\n**Master Rong’s Reflection:**\nThe world calls me great yet unremarkable. Only because it is great does it seem unremarkable. If it had long resembled something, it would be small indeed. The Old Master’s Dao is exalted in virtue and noble in power—truly worthy of being called great. Yet, he conceals his traces among the common, his presence hidden and inscrutable. He does not resemble the wise, nor does he resemble the foolish. Thus, he is called unremarkable.\n\n*Not resembling* means lacking comparison. Only the greatest of sages has nothing to compare to. If form had fixed qualities, wisdom had constant measures, or the Dao had attainments, these would be the petty schemes of small-minded people—not the boundless communion of the great sage.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Old Master’s essence is naturally vast, his fruits perfectly realized, so the common folk universally revere him as the Great Sage. Why is this? Only because in dealing with others, he is modest and yielding, never boasting or scoffing. Thus, it is so.\n\nOnly because it is great does it seem unremarkable. If it had long resembled something, it would be small indeed.\n**Commentary:** Only my Dao is supremely great, so it resembles nothing. If it were like the laws of past ages—having something to resemble—it would no longer be called great. It would have long been insignificant.\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThis explains why it seems unremarkable. Only because my Dao is vast and transcendent, beyond the grasp of ordinary perception, can it be called great. If it resembled anything—like the laws of past ages—it would lose its claim to greatness and become insignificant. These are petty, shallow teachings, no different from the common ways—how could they be called great?\n\n*Ah!* (也夫) is an exclamatory particle.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nOnly because it is great does it seem unremarkable. Only those whose virtue is truly great harm themselves by claiming distinction, so they feign folly, appearing unremarkable, making no distinctions, and not elevating themselves above others. If it had long resembled something—*xiào* (善), meaning \"excellence\"—if great scholars and wise ones, tall and self-exalted, practiced meticulous governance, such ways have long existed.\n\n「Its subtlety, *ah!* (夫), is that those who speak of *xiào* (善, excellence) are but like petty men, not the noble. Only the wise uphold it.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nOnly because the Sage’s virtue is lofty and great does he not boast before things. If he boasted, he would be like the multitude of small-minded ones.\n\nMaster He Shang’s original text used the character *xiào* (肖), \"not resembling\" being akin to \"not excellent\" (不善). It means that all beings, unable to follow the excellent Dao/Way, are thus deemed unworthy by my greatness. Only through arrogance and haughtiness does my greatness fail to be excellent. If one can practice the excellent Dao/Way, they should instead be humbled and modest.\n\n**The Third Section: Emphasizing the Three Treasures, urging all to take refuge therein.**\nI possess the Three Treasures, safeguarding and upholding them.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThough my Dao is great, it resembles nothing and lacks form, yet it holds these Three Practices, which are most precious. If one can steadfastly preserve, rely upon, and uphold them, they may govern themselves and the realm.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis clarifies why it appears unremarkable: precisely because it possesses these Three Practices, differing from the common ways. Thus, Master Laozi says my Dao, though great, resembles nothing, yet these Three Treasures are most precious.\n\nTo you, my successor, you must preserve and uphold them, safeguarding them to cultivate virtue and govern the realm.\n\n○ **Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nMaster Laozi speaks of my Three Treasures—compassion, frugality, and not daring to lead the world first—embraced and upheld.\n\n○ **Rong’s Explanation:**\nI possess Three Treasures: first, compassion (慈); second, frugality (俭); third, not daring to lead the world first (不敢为天下先). The common world values profit, esteeming it with seven rarities. The Dao lies in truth, weighing it with the Three Treasures. The meaning of the Three Treasures is not something sought externally; if one can be benevolent and wise toward all things, cherishing life and abhorring slaughter, this is the meaning of compassion.\n\nTo reduce taxes and lighten burdens, to be cautious in self-conduct and moderate in expenditure, neither extravagant nor ostentatious—this is the meaning of frugality.\n\nTo forget oneself for the sake of others, to retreat and guide them, not daring to lead the world first—this is the meaning of humility. To uphold these practices and cultivate virtue, applying these three principles, brings peace to the realm and tranquility to the family. Such is the greatness of this treasure.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThus, the Sage’s virtue is lofty and great, yet he does not boast before things, for it is by taking refuge in the Three Treasures—preserving and upholding them—that he attains this state. The Three Treasures are: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to lead the world first.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nCompassion leads to broad salvation; frugality ensures sufficiency. Not daring to lead the world first means he delights in advancing others without weariness.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis enumerates the Three Treasures. To embody benevolence and extend generosity, to love and nurture all beings—this is compassion. To moderate use and enrich others, not to deplete things—this is frugality. Not to initiate actions, but to harmonize without leading—this is not daring to lead the world first. The meaning of expansion and benefit is as follows in the text below.\n\n○ **Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nFirst, compassion—loving the people as if they were his own children. Second, frugality—levying taxes and burdens as though taking from himself. Third, not daring to lead the world first—practicing humility and retreat, not initiating discord.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nFirst, compassion—pitying and caring for the common folk, sharing their sorrows and joys. This is the Dao’s treasure. Second, frugality—desiring little and knowing contentment, guarding one’s portion without pride. This is the scripture’s treasure. Third, not daring to lead the world first—humble, yielding, and gentle, placing others before oneself, retreating to guide others. This is the Teacher’s treasure.\n\n**The Third Section: Repeating the Three Treasures, praising their efficacy.**\nCompassion thus fosters courage,\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nCompassion and benevolence, pity and wisdom, mean virtue abounds, hence courage in salvation and aid.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis reveals the Three Treasures’ power to dispel confusion. Ordinary men, when not compassionate, are courageous. In decisiveness, they reach exhaustion and constraint.\n\n**Translation of overlapping terms for consistency:**\n- *xiào* (善) = **excellence** (as in *xiào*道, the excellent Dao/Way)\n- *xiào* (肖) = **resembling** (as in *xiào*似, resembling)\n- *不肖* = **not resembling** (as in *不肖*, not resembling)\n- *三宝* = **Three Treasures** (as in Daoist practice, not Buddhist *triple gems*)\n- *保而持之* = **safeguarding and upholding them**\n- *修身理国* = **cultivate virtue and govern the realm** (consistent with previous translations)\n\nThe Sage now practices compassion as conduct, hence his courage in salvation and deliverance.\n*The Analects* states: \"The virtuous must have courage.\"\n\n○ Master He Shang says: Through compassion and benevolence, one attains courage in loyalty and filial piety.\n\n○ Master Rong says:\nCompassion thus yields courage,\nFrugality thus yields breadth,\nNot daring to lead the world first thus yields completion as a vessel and longevity,\nFor compassion toward all things, none shall harm them.\nWhen none harm them, there is no enemy before.\nBy having no enemy, thus one speaks of courage.\n\nIn application, extravagance is insufficient for affairs,\nIn practice, frugality leaves abundance for governance.\nReaching the distant and vast, hence one speaks of breadth.\n\nElevating oneself in humility and retreat,\nGuarding with yielding and softness,\nIts virtue is universal,\nIts conduct has completion,\nHonored by all things, thus one attains completion as a vessel and longevity.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Annotation:\nInternally repaying great compassion,\nExternally expanding to embrace all,\nThus courage enters the Three Realms,\nDescending to rescue the common folk.\n\nFrugality thus yields breadth.\n*御注*: By moderating expenses and cherishing resources, wealth abounds,\nHence one’s deeds extend broadly.\n\n○ *御疏*: Through moderation and frugality, not harming resources or people,\nThus one’s deeds extend broadly.\n\n○ Master He Shang says: When the sovereign practices frugality,\nThe people’s daily lives grow broad and ample.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Annotation: All dharmas are empty and illusory,\nAbandoning them without greed,\nFrugal, pure, and lofty—\nIts virtue is vast and profound.\n\nNot daring to lead the world first, thus one attains completion as a vessel and longevity.\n*御注*: The virtues of compassion and frugality,\nThrough humility and self-effacement, grow ever brighter.\nTo place others before oneself—\nPeople will never tire of it,\nThus one becomes the supreme vessel of the Dao.\n\n○ *御疏*: Diminishing oneself to benefit others,\nRetreating to advance all things—\nThis is not daring to lead the world first.\nThus all things rejoice in being pushed forward,\nAnd one becomes the supreme vessel of the Dao.\n\n○ Master He Shang says: Not daring to lead the world first,\nNot daring to be first among the world’s first.\nThus one attains completion as a vessel and longevity—\nCompletion as a vessel refers to the Dao-perfected,\nI am able to be the leader among those who embody the Dao.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Annotation: Only for the sake of courageously rescuing the common folk,\nRetreating to guide all things,\nThus in the secular world, one dwells alone in the Celestial Capital,\nAs the leader of all the Saints,\nDescending to the mortal realm, one occupies the august Nine-Ranked position,\nAs the honored vessel of the Dao.\n\n**Fourth Section: Illustrious Conduct Contrary to the Three Treasures Leads to Ruin and Death in Life and Beyond.**\n\nAbandoning compassion and courage,\nAbandoning frugality and breadth,\nAbandoning humility for precedence—\nDeath.\n\n*御注*: Now abandoning compassion and courage,\nCourage harms all things.\nAbandoning frugality and breadth,\nBreadth depletes resources.\nAbandoning humility for precedence,\nPrecedence invites resentment.\nDepleting resources and harming all things,\nAccumulating resentment among people—\nThis is the path that leads to death.\n\n○ *御疏*: *且* means \"temporarily.\"\nFollowing base desires and excessive cravings,\nEvery action defies the Dao.\nCombining the compassion that benefits all with reckless harm,\nAbandoning moderation in use for extravagant excess,\nAbandoning humility for arrogant precedence—\nSuch conduct violates compassion and frugality.\nApplied to governance, the realm perishes;\nApplied to self-cultivation, the body is lost—\nHence it is said: Death.\n\n○ Master He Shang says: Now abandoning compassion and courage,\nCommanding the world to abandon benevolence,\nOnly to pursue martial valor.\nAbandoning frugality and breadth,\nAbandoning restraint,\nOnly to indulge in extravagance.\nAbandoning humility for precedence,\nAbandoning self-effacement,\nOnly to strive to be first among all.\nDeath—such actions inevitably lead to the path of death.\n\n○ Master Rong says: Earlier, it was shown that those who possess the Three Treasures\nPractice compassion and attain courage,\nUphold frugality and achieve breadth,\nReside in humility yet reach precedence.\nNow, those who lose the Three Treasures\nCannot truly be compassionate,\nTemporarily knowing only reckless courage,\nTheir conduct cannot uphold frugality,\nTheir expenditures are boundless,\nThey do not comprehend humility or retreat,\nEagerly seeking to surpass all others.\nTo love courage without benevolence is futile,\nTo seek breadth without restraint brings ruin,\nTo reside first without virtue invites peril—\nHence it is said: Death.\n\n○ Master Yan says: Rejecting harmony and defying the divine,\nEvery action defies nature,\nDistancing oneself from blessings,\nDrawing near to calamity,\nThe Great Fate is severed,\nVital essence and spirit disperse—\nNot because one’s fate is thin,\nNor because others are malevolent,\nBut because one abandons the Dao and extols force.\n\n**Fifth Section: A Comprehensive Praise of Great Compassion, Whose Function is Supreme and Marvelous.**\n\nCompassion—\nWhen wielded in battle, it conquers;\nWhen wielded in defense, it fortifies.\n\n*御注*: Using compassion in battle,\nIts advantage lies in preserving the multitude.\nUsing compassion in defense,\nIts advantage lies in securing the people.\nEach safeguarding their own security,\nThus victory and fortification are attained.\n\n○ *御疏*: Compassion is the foremost of the Three Treasures,\nHence it is singled out for special praise.\nUsing compassion to repel war,\nOne can preserve the multitude.\nUsing compassion to defend,\nOne can secure the people—\nAll without losing compassion,\nThus victory and fortification are attained.\n\n○ Master He Shang says: Those who embody compassion and benevolence,\nThe people naturally turn to them with loyalty,\nTheir hearts and intentions united,\nThus in battle they conquer the enemy,\nIn defense they stand firm and unyielding.\n\n○ Master Rong says: Compassion in battle yields victory,\nIn defense yields fortification.\nHeaven aids those who are saved,\nWith compassion as their shield,\nUsing compassion as their means,\nThey do not stray from the Dao.\nIn battle, they inevitably overcome their foes,\nHence it is said: victory.\nIn defense, they face no collapse or peril,\nHence it is said: fortification.\nWith compassion as their heart,\nThe Mysterious Heaven thus protects them,\nHence it is said: *saved*.\nThe Supreme Dao thus preserves and guards them,\nHence it is said: *shielded*.\nInternally discerning right and wrong,\nIn conflict, they form the array,\nDispelling delusion is victory,\nThe body not losing the Dao is defense.\nAligning with the Dao, enduring through time, they are unharmed,\nHeaven aids them—\nExternally, no harm comes from things,\nThe Dao shields them.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Annotation: Compassion in battle yields victory,\nWith great compassion in the battlefield,\nSoldiers are moved by gratitude,\nThus swift and decisive triumph is achieved.\nInternally resolving [delusion] is like the Six Roots as soldiers,\nConfronting the Six Dusts without being obscured,\nThus victory is attained.\n\nWith compassion as their defense, they are steadfast,\nUsing compassion to guard and shield,\nThe people unite in harmony,\nThus they are firmly secure.\n\nInternally resolving with a compassionate and tranquil heart,\nTheir Dao-heart is unshakable and impenetrable.\nThe Mysterious Heaven aids them in salvation,\nThe Dao shields them with compassion.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\nUsing compassion in both war and defense,\nNot only does it bring human accord,\nThe Heavenly Dao is most clear—\nIt also aids and shields them.\n\nVictory in battle is Heaven’s salvation,\nSteadfastness in defense is Heaven’s protection.\nAll this stems from compassion,\nThus it is said: *Heaven’s salvation and protection through compassion*.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\n*Salvation* means *assistance*,\n*Protection* means *safeguarding*.\nThe Heavenly Dao blesses the virtuous—\nThe virtuous thrive, encountering no adversity.\nThus those who wage war with compassion,\nHeaven will assist them.\nThose who defend with compassion,\nHeaven will safeguard them.\nVictory and steadfastness begin with the practice of compassion,\nAnd end in receiving the Heavenly Dao’s clear aid.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThe Heavenly Dao saves the virtuous,\nNaturally granting them compassion and benevolence,\nSo they may cultivate and assist themselves.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nThe Heavenly Sage reveres the Dao,\nSaving and guiding those who practice compassion,\nAnd in return, they share compassion and benevolence,\nThus Heaven descends to aid and protect them.\n\nHence, within the Three Treasures, compassion is paramount,\nAnd among the Four Virtues, compassion is foremost—\nThus it is known that compassion’s meaning is vast indeed!\n\n○ **The Sixty-Eighth Chapter on the Virtuous Warrior of Antiquity**\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous:\nThe prior chapter fully expounds the Three Treasures,\nPraising the great compassion,\nThus this chapter follows to show\nThose who uphold the Three Treasures\nAttuned to the ancient Dao’s ultimate perfection.\n\nThis single chapter unfolds three themes:\nFirst, it draws upon ancient truths to exhort practitioners,\nSecond, it briefly enumerates the Three Virtues, revealing their superior practice,\nThird, it concludes with the Dao’s ultimate perfection, extolling their efficacy and power.\n\n**First: Drawing upon ancient truths to exhort practitioners.**\nIn the age when the Fire Officer regulated time,\nAnd the era of pure Dao was held in reverence,\nHuman hearts were simple and unadorned,\nUnconcerned with ostentation.\nWarriors who cultivated the Dao defended themselves with tranquil ease,\nThose skilled in battle halted their weapons to achieve victory,\nTheir thoughts were like smoldering embers,\nTheir forms like withered wood.\nAmong beasts, they dwelled without alarm,\nWithin flocks of tame birds, they moved without disorder.\nThus, the Duke of Zou tended his calves,\nIgnoring the filial submission of Yao’s heir,\nAnd the Marquis of Cheng plowed his fields,\nRejecting the words of Yu’s challenge,\nTheir conduct stood tall as Mount Hua’s peaks,\nTheir demeanor humble as Mount Ni’s summit.\nThe Son of Heaven could not claim them as subjects,\nThe feudal lords could not count them as allies.\nConfronting the business of the Dragon,\nThey feared not,\nDwelling among wooden geese,\nThey had nothing to dread—\nThus the virtuous warriors of antiquity\nWere worthy to be paired with Heaven itself!\n\nThe virtuous warrior does not rely on force,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\n*Warrior* means *one who serves*.\n*Force* means *threatening might*.\nThe enlightened ruler governs with virtue,\nPractices compassion and frugality to subdue all things,\nDoes not employ force to dominate people,\nHolding compassion as their highest virtue—\nThus it is said: *they do not rely on force*.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\n*Warrior* means *one who serves*.\nThose who govern the state with virtue\nHold virtue as their highest value—\nThus it is said: *they do not rely on force*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThe noble is in virtue and Dao,\nNot in martial prowess.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nWith compassion to approach all things,\nWith virtue to subdue people,\nNo state relies on brute strength,\nNo warrior values mere courage—\nWithout action yet transforming,\nThis is *not relying on force*.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nThe virtuous warriors of antiquity\nCultivated the Dao in quietude and withdrawal,\nNever abandoning compassion for force and courage.\n\n**Second: Briefly enumerating the Three Virtues to reveal their superior practice.**\nThe skilled warrior does not rage,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\nIf war is unavoidable, one must confront the enemy,\nWith compassion, it is virtuous—\nNot relying on fury.\nIf one uses force to contend,\nIt is not virtuous victory,\nFor the soft can overcome the distant,\nThe near can overcome the strong.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\nWhen the army marches to confront the enemy,\nTheir purpose is rooted in compassion and pity.\nThey drive away the stinging insects,\nExpel the pests—\nThat is all.\nThus it is known that virtuous warfare lies in halting the enemy,\nNot in relying on fury—\nHence it is said: *the skilled warrior does not rage*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThose who wage war with the Dao\nRestrain evil in their hearts,\nCutting off calamity before it sprouts,\nNever harboring resentment or anger.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nTo still the bandits and quell chaos is virtuous warfare.\nCompassion saves all things—\nNo need for rage.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nSkilled in penetrating the illusory nature of the world,\nThey can subdue the enemy before its rise,\nMasterfully embodying the emptiness of both opposition and compliance,\nThus their hearts hold neither joy nor anger.\n\nThe one who truly triumphs over the enemy does not contend,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\nVictory lies in harmony,\nHarmony brings virtuous triumph—\nThe ultimate virtue of complete victory,\nThus they do not engage in contention.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\nVirtuous victory lies in compassion,\nNot contending stems from upholding virtue.\nIf one uses force to seek victory,\nIt is not virtuous triumph.\nNow, the soft overcomes the distant,\nThe near overcomes the strong,\nCompassion and harmony are fully expressed,\nThey do not contend with the enemy—\nThe enemy surrenders on its own,\nThus it is said: *the one who truly triumphs does not contend*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThose who wage war with the Dao to triumph over the enemy\nDraw the near with benevolence,\nAttract the distant with virtue,\nDo not engage the enemy in battle—\nYet the enemy submits itself.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nThe Dao brings aid to all under Heaven,\nThe Four Seas come to acknowledge their rule,\nVirtue soothes the inner realm,\nThe Five Weapons are not raised—\nThings are subdued without blades,\nThus it is said: *triumph over the enemy*.\nWithout intent yet naturally revered,\nThus it is said: *no contention*.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nUnsoiled by the dusts,\nThis is called *triumph over the enemy*—\nSince they hold neither joy nor anger,\nWhat need is there for contention?\n\nThe virtuous leader uses others by placing themselves below,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\nTo employ others, they set themselves beneath,\nAll people exert their utmost strength—\nThis is the virtue of the bell and the clapper,\nThus it is said: *the virtuous leader uses others by placing themselves below*.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\nThe virtuous leader employs others through humility,\nThus people will exert their utmost strength,\nAnd success can be achieved.\nHence the *Book of Changes* says:\n*To place the noble below the humble,\nThe great gain the people’s trust*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThe virtuous leader employs others through humble assistance,\nAlways acting as the helper of others’ humility.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nTo use others without losing their natural talents,\nTo assign tasks according to their strengths in both culture and martial skill—\nThis is virtuous leadership.\nThe broad can encompass all,\nThe humble can avoid blame,\nThus it is said: *placing themselves below*.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nThose who practice humility and self-effacement\nWill naturally be revered by all things,\nThus they can employ others effectively.\n\nThe third *gōng* (structure) reaches the ultimate Dao/Way, praising virtuous power and capability.\nThis is called the virtue/power of non-contentiousness.\n\n○ Imperial Commentary (Tang Xuanzong):\nThis is called the virtue/power of non-contentiousness,\nThis is called employing others’ strength,\nThis is called aligning with the ancient Heavenly Dao/Way.\nThe virtuous leader prevails without contention,\nThe humble employs others’ strength.\nThose who can do so may align with Heaven and be called emperors,\nFor this is the most ancient and essential Dao/Way.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis (Tang Xuanzong):\nIn the preceding *gōng*, the virtuous warrior is always gentle yet never weak,\nThe virtuous fighter is always compassionate yet never wrathful,\nThe virtuous victor is always yielding yet never contentious,\nThe virtuous leader is always humble and places themselves below others.\nWhen one acts thus,\nAll things exhaust their abilities,\nPeople give their utmost effort—\nAll resulting from humility and self-effacement.\nIs this not the virtue/power of non-contentiousness?\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nIt means the noble places themselves below the humble.\nThis is the Dao/Way of not contending with others for moral virtue and power.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nThis *gōng* describes how one prevails over enemies without martial strength or anger.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nBy not contending with all things,\nOne perfects their own virtue/power.\nThis *gōng* praises the virtuous leader who prevails over enemies without contention.\nThis is called employing others’ strength.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis (Tang Xuanzong):\nWhen one remains silent, reverent, and humble,\nWhen one is modest and places themselves below others,\nPeople are naturally pleased,\nAnd willingly exert their utmost strength.\nThus the *Book of Odes* says:\n*Delight them to employ,\nAnd people forget their labor.*\nThis is employing others’ strength.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nWhen one’s body can place itself below others,\nThis is called employing others’ strength.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nThis *gōng* praises the humble leader who employs others,\nAnd thus people give their utmost effort.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nHumble and yielding like the female,\nNot contending with all things,\nOthers will naturally submit and serve as their own tools.\nThis *gōng* praises the humble leader who employs others.\n\nThis is called aligning with the ancient Heavenly Dao/Way.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis (Tang Xuanzong):\nThis summarizes the four preceding *gōng* on virtuous conduct,\nThe virtue/power of non-contentiousness.\nThose who can practice it may align with Heaven and be called emperors,\nFor this is the most ancient and essential Dao/Way.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThis is called aligning with Heaven.\nThose who can practice this have virtue/power aligning with Heaven.\nThis is the most ancient Dao/Way,\nThe most essential and concise Dao/Way of antiquity.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nTo embrace all things with the Dao/Way,\nTo attract the distant through culture,\nTo prevail over enemies without battle,\nTo stand alone in eminence without contention—\nTheir virtue/power is vast and exalted,\nComparable to Heaven above.\nTheir transformation is pure and harmonious,\nComparable to the ancient past.\nThey clarify the empty heart and full belly,\nThey sit in forgetfulness and merge with the Dao/Way,\nThey do not rely on coercive authority,\nThey do not exert themselves in martial prowess,\nThus it is said: *the virtuous warrior is never weak*.\nThey extinguish the emotions of right and wrong,\nThey remove the perceptions of love and hate,\nThus the virtuous fighter is never wrathful.\nAll things do not harm the martial,\nThey comply without resistance,\nThus the virtuous leader prevails over enemies without contention.\nWhen the heart-king (mind) is tranquil,\nAnd their aspiration lies in the *chōngxū* (void),\nTheir ears and eyes are undisturbed,\nTheir hands and feet are unlabored,\nThis is the humble leader who employs others.\nIn accordance with natural principles,\nHence it is said: *aligning with Heaven*.\nHarmonizing with ancient truth,\nReaching the Dao/Way’s ultimate fruit—\nThis is the ancient Dao/Way.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\n*Config* means *to align*.\n*Heaven* means *natural*.\n*Extreme* means *the fruit of the Dao/Way*.\nIt speaks of the virtuous practitioner who subtly embodies emptiness,\nWho penetrates the principles of inverse and compliance,\nWho does not contend with all things,\nAnd thus aligns with the utmost natural principles,\nHarmonizing with the ancient Dao/Way’s extreme fruit.\nThis concludes the *gōng*.\n\n---\n*End of Volume XVII of the Daoist Virtue/Power and Its Imitation (Daode zhenjing mude muxu juan) #1*\n*Missing \"courage\" in the original text; added based on context.*\n---\n*Volume XVIII of the Daoist Virtue/Power and Its Imitation (Daode zhenjing mude muxu juan)*\n*Imperial Commentary and Exegesis by Tang Xuanzong, with annotations by He Shang Gong (严君平), Master Rong (李荣), and Cheng’s Exegesis (成玄英疏) by the Western Hua Monk (西华法师).*\n\n*On the Practice of Warfare (Yongbing) #69*\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, for the prior chapter expounded upon those who guard and uphold the Three Treasures, who can attain the Dao/Way’s ultimate fruit of antiquity. Thus, this chapter elucidates how such practitioners embody the dual transcendence of emptiness and existence, never abandoning great compassion.\n\nWithin this single chapter, four distinct teachings unfold:\n1. **The application of martial power in dealing with all things**, demonstrating that all phenomena are illusory;\n2. **A reiteration of prior teachings**, to reveal true emptiness;\n3. **The practitioner who forsakes compassion**, who grows reckless and loses the Dao/Way;\n4. **The exercise of wisdom in traversing the world**, which never strays from great compassion.\n\n### **1. The application of martial power in dealing with all things, demonstrating that all phenomena are illusory.**\nWhen the sage-king **Emperor Yao** ruled, he slew **Gonggong** yet lamented his wickedness; when **Great Yu** acted, he struck down **Fangfeng** yet displayed righteous resolve. **Tang** exiled **Jie** to **Wutiao**, and **Wu** slaughtered **Zhou** at **Muye**. The **Divine Lady** (Xuannü) blazed forth, and the **White Deceiver** (Bai Jian) stood tall—though they waged external war against evil men, they were ultimately inwardly shamed by the triumph of virtue.\n\nThe **Old Master** (Laojun) teaches caution: *\"Retreat one foot, and my advance will be halted; press forward one inch, and I will not dare.\"* He feared losing his treasured virtue, lamenting the fleeting, deluded life of mortals. How could they know that when the **high black crow** (gao wu) is exhausted, the **fine bow** (liang gong) is concealed; when enemy states are diminished, the **strategists** (mou chen) perish?\n\nBefore the **military wells** (junjing) were dug, the soldiers would not thirst; before the **camp rations** (junfan) were cooked, the generals would not speak of hunger. Though **Bai Qi** was put to death in the **Qin court** and **Han Xin** was executed in the **Han prison**, why not follow the **two sages’** (Er Hao) example—hanging up one’s official hat at the **eastern gate**, emulating the **Four Worthies’** (Sihao) virtues, and letting thirst be nourished in the **Southern Hills**?\n\nHonor the **Great Sage’s** (Dasheng) clear instruction on self-restraint: *\"As long as my body remains, what need have I for further gain?\"*\n\n### **On the Practice of Warfare:**\n**Imperial Commentary:** The Old Master deplored the age’s reckless slaughter in war, thus assuming antiquity to admonish it.\n\n*\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* refers to the following text.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** The Old Master lamented the times, where lightheartedness toward enemies brings calamity and delight in killing leads to ruin. Thus, he invoked ancient teachings to warn against such folly, and *\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* refers to the next sentence.\n\n**Master He** (Heshang Gong) says: *\"He expounds the Dao/Way of warfare. The Old Master deplored the age’s warfare, thus assuming his own words to set forth their meaning.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** (Master Rong) says: *\"He cites ancient military strategies.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* means **martial power and wisdom** (quan zhi), the means by which one transforms and governs all beings—it is also how cultivators apply the **Six Senses** (liujing) in navigating the **phenomenal world** (chenjing). *\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* refers to the following text.\n\n*\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender,\"*\n**Imperial Commentary:** *\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender\"* means not daring to press forward one inch while retreating one foot. When the aggressor moves, he creates conflict and covetousness; when the defender remains passive, he relies on compassion to protect himself. To guard well is to achieve total victory; to create conflict is to court defeat. Though advancing even slightly risks stirring trouble, retreating even greatly does not lose humility. Thus, one must not dare to press forward one inch while retreating one foot.*\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *\"I\"* refers to the practitioner of warfare. The aggressor is the first to act, the defender responds afterward. The aggressor’s advance stirs conflict and covetousness; the defender’s retreat relies on compassion to guard himself. This teaches that ancient warriors, when wielding martial power, must always restrain themselves with compassion and never act impulsively.\n\nThus it is said: *\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender.\"*\n\n**Master He** says: *\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor\"*—the aggressor is the first to raise arms. *\"But only as the defender\"*—the defender is one who yields without provocation, always following the **Heavenly Mandate** (tian) before acting.*\n\n**Master Rong** says: *\"To raise arms first within one’s own state is to act as the aggressor; to move first in battle is to act as the aggressor. First to raise arms or first to move invites arrogance and peril. Now, if I wish to preserve myself, I must not dare to act as the aggressor. To yield without provocation, to follow without leading, is to act as the defender.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"Aggressor\"* refers to **myself** (my body); *\"defender\"* refers to **the enemy** (the opposing forces). Since both **essence and matter** (genchen) are emptied and all phenomena are illusory, there is neither a self to be preserved nor an enemy to be assailed. Thus, there is no need to advance or retreat.\n\n*\"I do not dare to press forward one inch while retreating one foot.\"*\n**Imperial Exegesis:** To retreat and defend in accordance with the Dao/Way is to achieve victory; to advance and seize by force leads to ruin. Though advancing even slightly risks the sin of greed, retreating even greatly gains the virtue of humility. Now, since I despise their strife, I say *\"I do not dare to press forward one inch,\"* and since I uphold compassion, I say *\"I retreat one foot.\"*\n\n**Master He** says: *\"To invade another’s territory, to plunder their wealth and treasures, is to advance. To close the gates and defend the city is to retreat.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** says: *\"Not to use force to invade others, hence *\"I do not dare to press forward one inch.\"* To rely on accumulated virtue to defend internally, hence *\"I retreat one foot.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"Advance\"* means **to take**; *\"retreat\"* means **to release**. One inch signifies **nothingness**; one foot signifies **existence**. Since both **wisdom and the world** (jingjing) are transcended and all phenomena are illusory, one abides in the **middle** (zhongyi), detached from both **action and non-action** (liangpian). Thus, there is nothing to take, nor anything to release.\n\n### **2. Reiterating prior teachings to reveal true emptiness.**\nThis is called **\"action without action\"** (xing wu xing),\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** When one retreats as the defender and does not contend, though one may move to meet the enemy, it is the same as **\"action without action.\"**\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** To march an army relies on halting the enemy; the key is not to contend. Now, as the defender retreating one foot, one achieves victory without contention. Though one moves to meet the enemy, it aligns with **\"action without action.\"**\n\n**Master He** says: *\"If the enemy does not cease, he becomes a robber of the world. Though one moves to punish him, one does not act with malice.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** says: *\"Warfare originates from the enemy; I truly do not act first. I respond to things but do not initiate action—this is **\"action without action.\"***\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** Having transcended the duality of existence and non-existence, and penetrating the **forgetfulness of all perceptions** (jingguan), one thus moves in **\"action without action.\"**\n\n*\"Though I have no arms to wield,\"*\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *\"To wield arms\"* signifies **anger**. Now, since one wages war without anger, it is as if there are no arms to wield. Hence it is said: *\"Though I have no arms to wield.\"*\n\n「○ Master He says: *\"Not to be angry is as though there were no arms to wield.\"*\n\n○ Master Yan says: *\"This demonstrates not harming others.\"*\n\nFirst to issue commands and rewards—those who submit early are rewarded, those who submit late are spared, those who surrender slightly are benefited, those who surrender greatly are prosperous, the guilty are pardoned, the capable are appointed—yet it is as though there were no arms to wield in anger.\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"To wage war in anger is to use arms to wield them. Now, when the enemy retreats a step, no arms are needed to repel them, hence it is said: 'as though there were no arms to wield.'\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"Having abandoned limbs and senses, there are no arms to wield.\"*\n\n**Still, there is no enemy,**\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Still\"* means \"to draw in.\" To draw in the enemy is to desire contention while not contending, hence it is as though there were no enemy to draw in.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Still\"* means \"to draw in.\" The one who draws in the enemy desires contention, but now non-contention is held as virtue—thus, there is no enemy to draw in, hence it is said: *\"Still, there is no enemy.\"*\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Even if there is a desire to draw in the enemy, it is as though there were no enemy to draw in.\"*\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"To draw in that enemy is to make them return to having no enemy.\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"All phenomena are empty illusions; there is no enemy to rely upon.\"*\n\n**To grasp without weapons.**\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"To grasp weapons\"* signifies killing. Now, since compassion is the principle, even if one grasps them, it is as though there were no weapons.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"To grasp\"* means \"to hold.\" Weapons are the five weapons—spears, halberds, and the like. He who holds weapons intends to kill the enemy, but since compassion is the principle, he restrains his weapons—thus, though weapons exist, there is no intent to kill, making it as though there were no weapons.\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Even if one desires to grasp and wield them, it is as though there were no weapons to hold or use.\"*\n\nWhy? Because harming their people invites retribution from Heaven, encountering an unrighteous ruler brings pity and sorrow.\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"To harm the unrighteous is to wield weapons to cease warfare. Punishments without cruelty do not lose compassion; those who yearn for the Dao return of their own accord—there are no weapons to wield.\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"Having abandoned form and wisdom, there are no weapons to use.\"*\n\n**Thirdly, it clarifies that those who abandon compassion are lighthearted, lose the Dao, and invite disaster.**\nDisaster is none greater than being lighthearted toward the enemy—being lighthearted toward the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"The greatest disaster is being lighthearted toward the enemy. Being lighthearted toward the enemy leads to peril, and one loses the treasure of compassion.\"*\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Nearly\"* means \"close to.\" *\"Loss\"* means \"to lose.\" *\"Treasure\"* refers to compassion. The greatest disaster is being lighthearted and contemptuous toward the enemy, indulging in conflict—thus, one is close to losing the treasure of compassion.\n\nMoreover, losing compassion means defeat and ruin in war, and dispersion in defense. Though the paths of disaster may vary, dispersion and ruin are the greatest calamities.\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Disaster is none greater than being lighthearted toward the enemy. The harm of chaos is none greater than deceiving and plundering a lighthearted enemy without cease—lighthearted warfare leads to defeat and ruin. Being lighthearted toward the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure—'nearly' means 'close to,' and 'treasure' means 'life.' Deceiving a lighthearted enemy nearly causes the loss of life.\"*\n\n○ Master Yan says: *\"Being lighthearted toward the enemy is self-indulgence. Though warfare may seem flawless, one must not lightly treat the enemy. Lightheartedness breeds deceit; when disaster strikes, one loses advantage. Fortune departs, calamity arrives—this is the loss of the natural treasure.\"*\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"Warfare is rooted in killing and should not be perpetually waged in times of conflict. The Dao values stillness and quietude; thus, one governs things through non-action. The priority is to settle the people without harm. If one abandons the Way of non-action and advances with restless warfare, being lighthearted toward the enemy, the state will collapse and the people perish—this is the greatest disaster. A prosperous state with abundant people, a sage ruler and virtuous ministers—this is called possessing treasure. When the people perish and grain is exhausted, ministers are humiliated and the ruler is in peril—this is the loss of treasure.\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"Disaster is none greater than contempt for the enemy. 'Contempt' means to lightly trample; 'enemy' refers to the frontier realm. Lightly staining oneself with dust invites the retribution of the Three Realms, thus bringing great disaster. Contempt for the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure—'nearly' means 'completely,' and 'treasure' refers to the Three Treasures from the previous chapter. To contain compassion while being bold is to contempt the enemy, inviting great calamity, thus completely losing the Three Treasures.\"*\n\n**Fourthly, it clarifies that when engaging with circumstances and applying wisdom, nothing surpasses great compassion.**\nThus, when armies clash, the one who exhibits compassion first shall prevail.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Antagonize\"* means \"to raise.\" When two states raise their armies against each other, the one who is compassionate and pitiful toward others wins.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Antagonize\"* means \"to raise.\" When two states raise their armies against each other, it is because their rulers practice the Dao, their generals act with compassion, and they are merciful toward others—not seeking excessive slaughter—that they achieve victory.\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Thus, when armies clash—the two enemies engage in battle—compassion prevails. Compassion is mercy and benevolence; soldiers do not approach death.\"*\n\n○ Master Yan says: *\"The ruler is the heart and core of the state; the army is its formidable spirit. Concealed in the mysterious realm, it is only used when unavoidable. Thus, I instruct my generals to delight the soldiers, be compassionate toward people, and move with Heaven’s assistance.\"*\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"When both sides raise their forces, it is called 'antagonizing armies.' Whether many or few, they are evenly matched. Being lighthearted toward the enemy, greedy for killing—this is inferior. Stillness must rely on the Dao; action must follow its laws. Never losing compassion, compassion can govern all—thus, the compassionate prevail. Internally, it clarifies that afflictions are manifold; without wisdom, they cannot be broken. To expound its method, it is said: 'Warfare has its principles.'*\n\n*The ruler must be strong and resolute; as a guest, one must be yielding and flexible. The traveler desires to cease movement and return to stillness, knowing to be strong as a ruler and yielding as a guest—hence it is said: 'I dare not be the ruler but must be the guest.'*\n\n*The Dao, though seemingly obscured, advances like retreat. Learning has nothing to learn; cultivation has nothing to cultivate—advancing not an inch yet retreating a foot. Recognizing that all conditions are contingent and teachings are all empty, one moves in 'action without action.'\"*\n\nThe myriad realms are void and tranquil, yet one’s own body is also empty and pure—*repelling without arms*. Internally, wisdom is lost; *holding without weapons*. Externally, emotions and desires are severed, yet still there is no enemy.\n\nIf one abandons emotions and indulges in extreme desires, straying from the Dao and forfeiting one’s life, they lose their precious treasure.\n\nWisdom and afflictions—these two kinds always follow one in turn. *Resisting is like yielding*; if skillful means are applied to wisdom, subtle compassion is never lost. When defilements are exhausted, even the mind relaxes; solemn and unburdened, the compassionate prevail.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: If, then. Compassion, mercy. Resisting, lifting. The roots of sense and dust press upon one; lifting the eyes, the forms and colors correspond.\n\nIf one still employs the great mercy of the heart to survey the coming realm, then subject and object are both emptied, and self and other are pure. Hence, all dharmas become realms of supreme victory.\n\n---\n\nThe Way of my words is most easy to know—*Chapter Seventy*.\n\nThe Way of my words follows the previous chapter, for the previous chapter expounds the proper method of dealing with people and wielding power, demonstrating the true emptiness of the Dao. Thus, this chapter follows, clarifying the teachings of the spoken word and lamenting that people cannot know them.\n\nIn this chapter, the text opens with two distinctions: first, lamenting that the profound teaching is easy to know yet common folk cannot grasp it; second, illustrating the sage’s subtle understanding, hence *outerly veiled, inwardly revealed*.\n\nFirst, lamenting that the profound teaching is easy to know yet common folk cannot grasp it.\n\n*The Book of Yu* says: The heart of the Dao is subtle, subtle then easy to perceive; the heart of people is dark, dark then difficult to see. They follow the crowd and drift with conventions, chasing fame and gain. Blessings are light as feathers, yet they do not know to bear them upon themselves; calamities are heavy as mountains, yet they do not know to avoid them from themselves.\n\nThe common folk are indeed deluded in their measure; truly, this saying holds. The Way beneath heaven is easy to practice, yet none surpass the upright. Uninvolved, unconcerned, with no attachments nor demands.\n\nWhere is the resting place of the mind? Roaming the wilds of Dongting, boundless in all directions—no hindrance. In the silent night or the celestial halls, all paths are the same, utterly pure. Shutting the eyes, one arrives at the *Pure Land of Jade*; forgetting the mind, one sits in the *Empty Palace of Jade*. Still and unobstructed by dust, what need is there for the wise to change? Yet they stubbornly persist, indulging in luxury at dawn’s table; staining themselves with sounds and colors in their attachments. Slothful and fixed in evil deeds, they sink into the *difficult-to-abandon* realm, unaware of the easy-to-practice teaching. The sage in rags is indeed worthy of pity.\n\nMy words are most easy to know, most easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: The Old Master says: My spoken words accord with principle, hence easy to know; they are simple in practice, hence easy to act.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: The Old Master says: My words are such that they clarify principle. When principle is clarified, words are forgotten—hence easy to know. My affairs are such that they involve no affairs; simplicity in affairs means no action—hence easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: The Old Master’s words are concise and easy to know, brief and easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Yan* says: The sage’s words are the unsaid words; their deeds are the *doing of the undone*. They sever the Way of words, abandon the mind and discard intentions. Their actions are the manifestation of naturalness. All beings fulfill their desires and attain eternal life. Words are easy to know; affairs are easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Rong* says: The sage’s teachings are concise in words yet rich in principle, clearly revealing their meaning—hence easy to know. Holding to the One, they sever the myriad delusions; embracing non-action, they cut free from burdens—hence easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: My words are the same as the previous chapter. What is stained is not truly stained—this is easy to know. To practice without the form of practice is most easy to practice. None beneath heaven can know, none can practice.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: The people of the world are entangled in words and do not awaken; they are burdened by affairs and do not simplify—hence none can know, none can practice.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: This laments that the multitude cannot comprehend the *wordless word*, clinging to words and stagnating in teaching. They are bewildered by the words of instruction, hence none can know. Unable to perceive the *affairless affair*, burdened by affairs and lost in dusty matters—hence none can practice.\n\n○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: They love the weak and soft, yet crave the strong and rigid.\n\n○ *Master Rong* says: The common folk do not adhere to the mysterious teachings; they cling to ignorance and have not yet opened to wisdom. They do not recognize this Way—hence none can know. They are lost in desires and do not habituate in non-action; they abandon the true and follow the false—hence none can practice.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: None, that is, without. The Old Master’s words are easy to know and practice, yet the people of the world are dull and obtuse. None can know the profound and empty words; none can follow the teaching and practice.\n\nWords have a *root*; affairs have a *master*.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: Words reside in principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten—hence the root of words is in the wordless. Affairs reside in accomplishment; when success is achieved, one does not cling to them—hence the master of affairs is in the affairless.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: This reverses the explanation of easy-to-know and easy-to-practice. Root, origin. Master, lord. Words exist to clarify principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten—hence the root of words is in the unsaid. Affairs exist to achieve success; when success is attained, one abandons affairs—hence the master of affairs is in the affairless. Is this not easy to know and practice?\n\n○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: My words have a root and origin; affairs have lords and subjects. The world’s people, if they do not know them, are not without virtue—it is they who oppose me.\n\n○ *Master Rong* says: Root, origin. Master, lord. Taking virtue and the Dao as the origin, this is truly easy to know. Taking non-action as the lord, this is truly easy to practice. Those who lose the origin and chase the end are many; those who do not embody the true root and abandon emotions to defy nature are numerous. How could they know that the lord and master are such that all follow and practice accordingly? Hence it is said: None beneath heaven can know or practice.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Words, the scriptures and teachings. Master, the Son of Heaven.\n\nThe teachings, though broad, find their essence in the *Zhongyuan* (Recondite Mystery). Worldly affairs, though manifold, are governed by the Lord and Master. Seizing this essential meaning reveals what is easy to know.\n\nIt is only because of their ignorance that they fail to know me.\n*御注*: It is only because the common people lack the awakened understanding that they do not know my teaching of non-speech and non-affairs.\n\n*御疏*: \"Do not know me\" means they do not know my teachings. It is only because the common people are bewildered and lack awakened understanding, bound by names and forms, unable to grasp the principles. In affairs, they cling to affairs; in speech, they are entangled in words—thus they fail to grasp my teaching of non-speech and non-affairs.\n\nAgain, it is explained: The Old Master said, \"Only what I know is what lies in non-knowing,\" yet the people of the world use knowing to seek knowing, hence they do not know me.\n\n*Master He Shang Gong* says: It is only because the world’s people are ignorant that my Dao and virtue remain obscure, unseen externally, reaching the utmost subtlety—thus they are without knowing.\n\n*Master Rong* says: All things are shrouded in delusion, lacking even a speck of discernment within, hence it is said they are without knowing. Lost in principle and straying from the Way, they lack the wisdom of ten thousand things externally, hence they do not know me.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: \"Do not know me\" is the same as \"do not know my teachings.\" Only those beings who are ignorant and dull-witted cannot comprehend my profound words. Those who know me are few, hence those who follow me are noble.\n\n*御注*: Those who truly understand my teaching of forgetting knowing are rare. The law of my speechless instruction is thus most noble.\n\n*御疏*: \"Few\" means \"rare.\" \"Law\" means \"principle.\" The Old Master said that those who understand my teaching of knowing while forgetting knowing are indeed few. If one follows and practices my words as law, then they may be held in honor.\n\n*Master He Shang Gong* says: \"Few\" means \"rare.\" Only those who attain the Dao can know me, hence they are noble.\n\n*Master Rong* says: The busy and petty value names, the petty-minded love profit. Few can embody the Dao, hence it is said those who know me are few. The weak and lost do not return; their return lies in the true path. Those who drift do not reflect; their reflection lies in the true source. The Dao is thus honored, and the law is thus noble.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Those who know me are few, for the common mind is shallow and many are deluded, few truly comprehending the sacred teachings. Those who follow me are noble—\"follow\" means \"law.\" Adhering to my scriptures and teachings, practicing them, and attaining the sacred fruit, this is why they are noble.\n\nNext, it is shown that the Sage’s wisdom is profound yet externally veiled, internally illuminated. Hence the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\n\n*御注*: Wearing coarse cloth means concealing the external. Harboring jade means illuminating the internal. Thus, those who know me are few.\n\n*御疏*: \"Coarse cloth\" refers to a rough garment, worn by the lowly. Wrapping oneself in coarse cloth conceals fine garments beneath. Jade is pure and lustrous, fitting to compare with the virtuous gentleman. This is said to reveal the Sage’s inner wisdom, outwardly appearing foolish, hence \"wearing coarse cloth,\" and inwardly possessing wisdom, hence \"harboring jade.\"\n\n*Master He Shang Gong* says: Wearing coarse cloth means being thin externally; harboring jade means being rich internally. It is to hide treasure and conceal virtue, not revealing it to others.\n\n*Master Yan* says: Wearing coarse cloth means being meager in body; harboring jade means being rich in spirit.\n\n*Master Rong* says: Conforming to the world and blending with dust, outwardly showing coarse garments—this is wearing coarse cloth. The Recondite Virtue is unstained, pure and luminous—this is harboring jade.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Knowing the Sage’s words and following the Sage’s teachings, with understanding and practice complete, one thus becomes a Sage. Coarse cloth is the garment of rustics; jade is a precious treasure. Externally blending with the world, wearing coarse cloth; internally serene and empty, harboring jade. Harboring jade means outwardly dwelling in the mundane while always true; wearing coarse cloth means inwardly empty and focused while interacting with others.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the previous chapter illuminated the Sage’s knowing, hence externally veiled and internally illuminated. Thus, this chapter follows, showing that even though one may know, there are many who mistake knowing for non-knowing. This chapter’s meaning is divided into two parts: first, revealing the traces of the original traces, demonstrating responses adapting to circumstances; second, revealing the stillness within responses, manifesting the Sage’s heart unburdened.\n\n**First: Revealing the traces of the original traces, demonstrating responses adapting to circumstances.**\n\nTo shut the door and block the senses is the grand rule of the great Sage. To curb desires and be cautious of subtleties is the exemplary standard of the ancient worthies. Hence, the Duke of Zhou’s temple was restored with threefold silence from the golden mouth, and the Master’s courtyard saw twice-repeated words from the white jade tablet. Ji Bu was esteemed for a single promise, yet He Chen’s extravagance led to ruin at ten thousand coins. Austerity brings clarity and tranquility; extravagance invites reproach and calamity. Liu Kun, embodying the Dao, answered the Han Emperor with evident clarity. Yan Zi nearly attained it, dwelling in Confucius’ gate as if in ignorance. How could he compare with the clamorous thief Zhi, who died for gain at Dong Ling? The meticulous Jiang Chong perished in the Northern Prison from slander. Geng Chun was mocked in the marketplace and met with great disaster. Kong Guang did not betray the secret at Wen Shu, thus preserving his life.\n\nDoing leads to ruin. Recently, observing the drilling of Hun Dun, one fails to grasp its subtlety. Yet, if one heeds the admonition of the enemy’s mirror, a hundred hooks will lead to ruin, while nurturing a chicken fully ensures victory. The Sage’s illness—is it for the sake of common folk?\n\nKnowing the unknown...\n\n「若不知而强知，则为知之病矣。知而绝知，不困於知知，故不生祸乱，而知之病息矣。\n　　**知不知，上**—圣人妙契重玄，迹不乖本，洞忘虚寂，知则无知，至本虚凝，故称为上。圣人不言知，以其病病众生之强知，故不自病，怀通达之智，托於不知者，欲使天下质朴忠正，各守纯性。小人不悟此意，妄行强知之事，以自显着，终伤身损命，灭寿消年矣。\n\n　　**不知知，病**—常俗之人强谓有知，执取着之缚，故为行之病。所照之境触境皆空，能鉴之智无智不寂，能所俱泯，境智同忘，若照如无照，知如无知，则为上德；否则，多知多失，损命伤身，是知之病也。\n\n　　**人不畏威**—上天有龙象雷霆之威，冥司有三途五苦之罚。人若不畏破裂之苦，须臾堕地狱，遭极辛苦：隐隐搏天之羽，飞劫石而难周；皎皎日月之晖，照幽涂而莫晓；岩岩铜柱左右伤身，凛凛刀山纵横碎骨。魂魄号叫，思脱而无闻；出气成姻，吞铁丸而喉烂。前生何罪，得至於斯？良由狭其所居，不修於命，岂知唐尧化美，广辟四门，殷帝含仁，大开三面？吉祥止止，道德淳淳，其度量若大鹏举赤霄，长鲲跃沧海：举逸翮而纵凌唳，直压云天；蓄巨鳞而鼓波涛，横击淇渤。不知上下，莫辨东西，岂厌其生，以成偏狭，去彼取此者？此乃圣人之图也。」\n\nIf the people do not fear the lesser threats, then the greatest calamities shall come.\n\n**Commentary (御注):** That which is truly a threat and worthy of fear is called *威 (Wei)*.\n\nIt is said that when one does not fear small matters, being careless of the subtle and minute, then the greatest and most fearful consequences shall arise.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** That which is truly a threat and worthy of fear is called *威 (Wei)*.\n\nThe onset of misfortune and harm begins with the trivial and insignificant. Accumulated, these become burdensome afflictions—great threats. If one does not heed the small and subtle, then the great and fearful consequences shall come to pass.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** *Wei* is harm. If one does not fear small harms, then great harms shall come—meaning death itself.\n\nThose who fear should cultivate *jing* (精) and nurture *shen* (神), aligning with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Master Yan’s Saying (严曰):** Prosperity and decline, fortune and misfortune, all arise from oneself. If one does not fear the subtle, then greater fears shall manifest.\n\n**Master Rong’s Saying (荣曰):** *Wei* refers to laws and punishments. If one does not fear minor transgressions, accumulating evil without restraint, violating laws and taboos, then ruin and death shall follow—great threats shall come.\n\nWithin, one does not fear the defilements of dust, indulging desires without restraint. When desires run wild, *jing* scatters; when the form is defiled, *shen* departs. When *shen* departs, the form decays; when *jing* scatters, the body weakens. Thus, one who enters the True Dao without *lǜ* (绿, vitality) becomes prey to birth and death—great threats shall come.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** *Wei* refers to punishments and laws, as in the scriptures and precepts. Great threats are the three evil realms and the punishments of the Northern City (地狱). It is said that those who disregard scriptures and precepts, recklessly committing evils, shall face the winds of punishment and great retribution—it shall surely come to pass.\n\n---\n\n**Second Admonition: Cultivate an Open Heart to Attain the True Source**\n\nDo not narrow your dwelling.\n\n**Commentary (御注):** The dwelling of the spirit is the heart.\n\nTo not narrow is to eliminate emotions and desires.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** The dwelling of the spirit is the heart. One must forget emotions and desires, softening and widening the mind, allowing the spirit chambers to rest, so that the spirit may reside in the heart, and life may be preserved.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** The heart, as the dwelling of the spirit, must be open and yielding, not narrow and constricted.\n\n**Master Yan’s Saying (严曰):** No greater calamity exists than losing one’s body; no greater blessing than preserving life. The way to preserve life lies in nurturing the spirit, and the key to nurturing the spirit is in stillness and openness.\n\n**Master Rong’s Saying (荣曰):** Do not narrow your dwelling, do not grow weary of your life. People take life as joy, cherishing birth as noble. Yet they fail to rest quietly to nurture life, cultivate virtue to ward off death, wandering like lost travelers, clinging to foreign places as vast, while despising their homeland as narrow. This is to narrow one’s dwelling.\n\nProlonging evil harms conduct; indulging desire harms the body. To act thus is to court death, unable to endure long. To weary of life—this is what must be avoided.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Do not narrow your dwelling, do not weary of your life. *Yàn* (厌) means to abandon; *xiá* (狭) means inferior. *Jū* (居) means to dwell. Your life is the heart. It is said that those who cultivate the Dao must keep the heart unencumbered, not confining emotions to narrow or inferior states, abandoning the source of life. Why? Though the body is empty, it is the vessel for receiving the Dao. One must neither cling to it nor reject it. To cling brings attachment to action; to reject falls into the illusion of emptiness. Neither clinging nor rejecting, dwelling in the middle while forgetting the middle—this is the way of the True Scholar.\n\nDo not weary of your life.\n\n**Commentary (御注):** That which the body generates is the spirit. To not weary is to have few thoughts and desires, avoiding exhaustion.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** That which the body generates is the spirit. *Yàn* (厌) means to despise. The spirit is what gives life, hence it is called that which the body generates. The spirit thrives in emptiness and stillness; one must purify the heart and quiet the mind, and the spirit shall return. If one indulges desires, exhausting the spirit’s purity, or engages in frivolous schemes, then *jing* and *qi* shall scatter and dissipate. When they dissipate, death follows. Thus, it is admonished to not weary of the spirit, preserving the way of enduring life.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** That which sustains life is the spirit, dwelling in emptiness, favoring stillness. If one overeats, neglects the Dao, and indulges in lust, filling the mind with perversity, this is to harm the root and weary the spirit.\n\nOnly those who do not weary shall not be wearyed.\n\n**Commentary (御注):** Only those who do not weary the spirit shall find the spirit does not weary of them in return.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** The *Dao* lends itself to those who honor it daily. The form is sustained by the spirit. If one loves the Dao and preserves the spirit, it is said, \"Only those who do not weary shall not be wearyed.\" Cleansing impurities and stilling thoughts, being singular and pure, the spirit does not weary of the person—hence, \"it is so.\"\n\n**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** Only those who do not weary the spirit—cleansing the heart of filth, serene and desireless—shall find the spirit dwelling within them without weariness.\n\n**Master Rong’s Saying (荣曰):** Life arises from the Dao, form is completed by the spirit. If one loves the Dao and preserves the spirit, it is said, \"Only those who do not weary shall not be wearyed.\" Cleansing impurities and stilling thoughts, the mind becomes tranquil, the form pure. When the spirit attaches to the person and the Dao cherishes them, it is said, \"it is so.\"\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Only those who cultivate the realm of refinement—neither empty nor substantial—can truly cultivate it. Wisdom neither clings nor rejects; rejection aligns with wisdom, hence it is not wearying.\n\n---\n\n**Third: Illuminating the Sage’s Proof to Show Taking and Discarding**\n\nThus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,\n\n**Commentary (御注):** Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself, loves himself without arrogance. Knowing his own body, he wards off fearful matters. Loving his own body, he avoids the guilt of wearying the spirit. He does not reveal his abilities to invite misfortune, nor does he exalt himself to gather resentment. Abandon this revealing and exalting; embrace this knowing and loving.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** *Zì zhī* (自知) is self-reflection and introspection, preventing harm in its subtlety, ensuring no fearful matters arise. *Bù zì xiàn* (不自见) means not to flaunt one’s talents before others, lest one deviate from reason and invite misfortune.\n\nThus, **Master Héshàng Gōng** said: The Sage knows himself, and thereby knows his own gains and losses. He does not reveal himself, meaning he does not display his **virtue/power** and beauty outwardly, but keeps them within.\n\n**Róng** said: Therefore, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself, loves himself without arrogance. Thus, he abandons the latter to embrace the former. Ordinary emotions stray from the **Dao/Way**, and so they become **unaware** (無識). The Sage’s wisdom penetrates reason, so he knows himself and forgets the distinctions of self and others, obliterates sensory perceptions, and thus does not reveal himself. **Treasure the spirit and spare the qi**, firmly resolve to cultivate the **Dao/Way**, not lightly squandering this life, hence it is said: love himself without exalting himself, not holding cheap what is small nor despising what is low, acting to benefit others, and in his aspirations, harmonizing high and low. Thus, it is said: he does not exalt himself.\n\nThose who know and love themselves have awakened to reason; those who reveal and exalt themselves are lost in delusion. The Sage speaks of self-transformation to guide all things, making them aware of their proper return. He discards the delusion of revealing and exalting to take up self-knowing and self-loving, thereby preserving his true nature.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** His wisdom aligns with the **Dao/Way’s** realm, penetrating the true source of **dharma**. Thus, he knows himself. The four **Great Elements** (四大) are provisionally assembled; through **sitting meditation** (坐忘) and dissolution of the body (隳體), he does not reveal himself.\n\nHe loves himself without exalting himself.\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis (御疏):** The Sage cherishes and protects his own body, abstaining from cravings and desires, so that the spirit does not weary, and he does not exalt himself—meaning he does not boast of his own worth, nor oppress others, for such behavior would only gather resentment.\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Love himself means to cherish his own body, thereby preserving the **qi**. Not exalt himself means not to seek high status or fame in the world.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Nurturing the true nature of his essence, he does not lightly indulge in sensual desires—this is loving himself. In humility and quiet retreat, he places others before himself—this is not exalting himself.\n\nTherefore, he discards the former to embrace the latter.\n\n**Róng’s Commentary (御注):** Discard the revealing and exalting; take up the knowing and loving.\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis (御疏):** To discard revealing and exalting, to take up knowing and loving—this is the Sage attaining **equanimous wisdom** (平等智), comprehending the **emptiness of **dharma**-nature** (法性空). Reason holds no distinction between taking and discarding; he opens his teachings to guide the ordinary, using metaphorical language to this end.\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Discard revealing and exalting, take up knowing and loving.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Discard revealing and exalting, take up knowing and loving—to show all things a mirror of warning, hence the metaphor of taking and discarding.\n\n**Chapter 73: \"Courageous and Bold\"**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior passage reveals how sentient beings, lacking wisdom, fear neither the **Dharma-net** nor the **Three Paths of Retribution**, thus sinking into suffering. Hence, this chapter emphasizes how the courageous and resolute, through their deeds, return to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:\n1. The differing paths of the common and the Sage, with their contrasting benefits and harms;\n2. The natural consequences of virtue and licentiousness, arising from **Heavenly Principle** (*天理*);\n3. The conclusion that Heaven’s net is vast, yet retribution is without fail.\n\n**First, the differing paths of the common and the Sage, with their contrasting benefits and harms.**\n\nThe Sage’s heart, like Heaven’s application of the **Dao**, governs the realm with humility—when kings establish their states, modesty brings radiance, and gentleness yields authority. Yet boldness, when unchecked, invites calamity. Thus, the **Vermilion Emperor** flourished by yielding, while the **White Lord** perished by defiance. Boldness, when reckless, leads to slaughter—this truth is clear. Yet why do people not reflect upon it?\n\nWhen **Fenglong** raises his voice, he meets the **Summer Emperor** and must sing;\nWhen wild geese take flight, they align with the autumn mist and rise.\nEven mindless things respond to the seasons—how much more so should humans, bearing hearts, act without the **Dao** as their guide?\n\nHeaven’s net is unerring; the sun and moon maintain their constancy.\nEarth’s **Principle** is without bias—mountains and rivers stand firm, never crumbling into decay,\nNor do they erupt in chaos at the **Tail Interval** (*尾间*).\nWhen the **Way of Gentleness** is vast and **Virtue of Humility** is steadfast,\nResponding without speech, arriving without summons,\nEven Heaven’s net, though vast, will not fail to record accumulated **virtue and vice**.\n\n**Boldness leads to death; courage tempered by restraint leads to life.**\n**Róng’s Commentary:** *Dare* means decisive boldness—when a person acts with reckless resolve, abandoning humility and retreat, it brings ruin. Thus, it leads to death. But restraint preserves life.\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Courage* is vigor; *dare* is decisive action. Those of rigid strength, fearing nothing, lose humility and retreat, descending into reckless defiance—this is the path of self-destruction. Hence, *\"Boldness leads to death.\"* But when one acts with caution, restraining aggression and avoiding peril, this is the path of self-preservation. Hence, *\"Courage tempered by restraint leads to life.\"*\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Boldness leads to death—bold action invites self-ruin. Courage tempered by restraint leads to life—boldness without recklessness preserves one’s life.\n\n**Li Róng** said: Boldness is fearlessness; *dare* is resolute intent. To face blades before one, regarding death as life—that is the courage of the heroic. Yet lacking strategy, strength alone cannot prevail. If one pursues gain recklessly, disaster follows. Hence, it leads to death. But if one acts without contention, guided by **ren** and **virtue**, perhaps through **Dao** to transform others or through wisdom to subdue things—harming none, yet safeguarding oneself—this leads to life.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Courage* is swift action; *dare* is decisive resolve; *death* is annihilation; *life* is longevity. When the heart rushes forward with resolute intent, clinging to worldly affairs, it leads to annihilation. But if the heart remains serene and detached, avoiding attachment, then it attains longevity. Understanding these two paths reveals their differing benefits and harms.\n\n**Róng’s Commentary:** Knowing these two paths—whether beneficial or harmful—what does Heaven abhor? The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. *Or* means \"possessing.\" Those who know to refrain possess benefit; those who dare possess harm. One must therefore cultivate courage in restraint—this is the way of the truly bold. To act recklessly invites disaster, for this is what Heaven abhors. Who can fathom its intent?\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. When one knows that boldness leads to harm and restraint to benefit, one must cultivate courage in restraint. Though both share the name *courage*, their applications differ—hence, *\"or beneficial, or harmful.\"*\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Always knowing these two paths—*dare* and *not dare*—benefit is preserving life; harm is self-destruction.\n\n**Li Róng** said: This refers to death and life.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Or* means indeterminate. The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. When the heart advances without attachment, it attains longevity—thus, benefit. When the body acts greedily, it returns to annihilation—thus, harm.\n\n**Second, the consequences of virtue and licentiousness, arising from Heavenly Principle.**\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor, and who can know its intent?\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Who* means \"who.\" *Intent* means \"reason.\" Those who act boldly invite harm—this is what Heaven’s **Dao** abhors. Yet common folk cannot grasp its reasoning.\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: What Heaven abhors is reckless action. Who can know its intent and avoid transgression?\n\n**Li Róng** said: Heaven’s **Dao** cherishes life and abhors killing. Yet people often fail to seek benefit or avoid harm—this is ignorance of Heaven’s intent.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** By nature, Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness. Examining retribution’s depths, none can fathom its sovereign. Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\n**Róng’s Commentary:** Even the Sage finds boldness perilous.\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** This example of the Sage admonishes the common. Though the Sage’s wisdom makes boldness difficult, fearing its harm, how much more so for the ordinary who would dare it?\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: The Sage’s virtue, even so, finds boldness arduous. How much more for those without the Sage’s virtue who would attempt it?\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not compete with things; the four seasons wax and wane, yet none dare defy them. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** Since the previous passage spoke of what Heaven abhors, these four lines broadly expound Heaven’s **Dao** of humility, warning against human boldness. People harbor thoughts of victory and defeat, hence the contention; Heaven’s **Dao** is evenhanded, rewarding only the virtuous. None dare defy it, so it is said to triumph through virtue. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not contend with humans over nobility and lowliness, yet humans still revere it. ○\n**Róng** said: Heaven’s **Dao** is without intent; it does not vie with things, yet naturally holds eminence and precedes all.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not speak, yet virtue responds. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** How could Heaven speak? It merely bestows blessings on the virtuous and retribution on the licentious, with omens of good and ill—thus it is said that virtue responds without speech. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not call, yet all things move in response to the seasons. ○\n**Róng** said: Retribution for crimes and blessings is as certain as an echo; thus it is said that virtue responds. ○\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** The response of blessings and retribution is like an echo—evil and virtue must answer without need of words.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not summon yet things come of their own accord. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** The coming of all things is by fate’s decree, yet Heaven does not summon them to obey itself. All things come naturally and follow Heaven’s way—like the yin embracing the yang, spring arises and summer flourishes, none summoned yet they come. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not call to all things; they bear yin and turn toward yang. ○\n**Róng** said: Spring blooms, winter fades; cold departs, heat arrives. Those who go are not sent away, those who come are not summoned by command. ○\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** Retribution for virtue and vice follows their deeds—no need for summoning, yet it must come.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven is tranquil yet ever well-planned. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** The note says Heaven’s **Dao** is profound and vast, silently vast, symbolically transforming—humans may take it as model, hence it is said to be well-planned. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: *Tán* means vast; though Heaven’s **Dao** is wide and boundless, it plans well for human affairs, rewarding virtue and punishing vice, each receiving their due. ○\n**Yán** said: Silent and boundless, nothing escapes its design. ○\n**Róng** said: The Great **Dao** is most level; thus it is said to be *tán* and *rán*. It weighs human gain and loss, with rewards and punishments without error; it discerns virtue and vice, with calamities and omens never failing—thus it is said to be well-planned. ○\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Cóng* means calculation. It speaks of the hidden principles of fate, needing no words to precisely measure deeds and misdeeds, without error.\n\n**Third Paragraph:** Heaven’s net is vast and wide, yet retribution never falters.\nHeaven’s net spreads far and wide, yet its rewards and punishments for virtue and vice are never lost, not even by a hair’s breadth. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Huīhuī*, vast and wide. This passage elucidates the previous meaning of Heaven’s **Dao**. Though Heaven’s net is vast and wide, far-reaching and sparse, its rewards for virtue and punishments for vice never fail, not even by a hair’s breadth. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: What Heaven’s net encompasses is vast and boundless; though sparse and distant, it oversees and judges human virtue and vice without error. ○\n**Róng** said: It spreads through the boundless void and weaves among manifest forms—both vast and wide, hence *huīhuī*. Crimes are public or private, yet Heaven’s mercy knows no scale; even the slightest offense is recorded, with no oversight in its sparse or dense tracking—thus it is said to never fail.\n\n**Chapter 74: People Do Not Fear Death**\n*Chapter on People Not Fearing Death*, thus following the previous. The prior chapter showed how creatures do not fear threats or punishments, yet must face Heaven’s net; hence this chapter follows, revealing that Heaven’s net has its unseen overseers.\n\nThis chapter unfolds four themes: First, that creatures are burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and do not fear punishment; Second, that crimes, once deep, will surely invite suffering retribution; Third, that these sufferings are meted out by unseen judges; Fourth, that those who presume to act as Heaven’s judges will instead incur its blame.\n\n**First Theme:** Creatures are burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and do not fear punishment.\nHeaven’s **Dao** upholds true names; punishment is natural. Why then do rulers threaten people with death? They wear jade pendants at their belts and display them in times of crisis, clutching golden scepters and wielding them at the court’s threshold. Yī and Lǚ serve as ministers, Píng Bó plots to overthrow. The dynasty’s fate is sealed—when the age of great peace arrives, the ruler’s singular merit alone will earn him the title of *yīràng* sovereign. Then he may drum his belly in the courtyard and strike the earth in the fields, unaware of Heaven’s power, how could he bear the king’s favor?\n\nIn May, he wears his winter coat, not envying the lightly clad guest; a foot of cloth is too short, yet he keeps only the upright man. Then he understands the hundred-year fate is all by Heaven’s decree.\n\nIn life, gold and jade mark his dwelling, yet he knows the fate of the withered ram; in death, his stone tablet bears gold inscriptions, and Guō Pú foretells it first. Thus the saying: *\"Death and life have fate; truly, it is so.\"*\n\nNow, if one falsely executes punishment to replace Heaven’s judgment, how could such logic be erased? How could the unseen judges agree? It is like a substitute craftsman measuring with a ruler—he will surely suffer injury to his hands.\n\nPeople are unaccustomed to fearing death—why then do rulers threaten them with it? ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** If one indulges desires freely, provoking death’s reach, and grows accustomed to it without fear, how could rulers further establish punishments to strike terror through killing?\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** It speaks of how people cannot uphold the **Dao/Way** of purity and tranquility, instead indulging their passions and provoking death’s grasp. This becomes ingrained habit, and they grow so accustomed that they no longer fear it. Thus, rulers should guide them through the **Dao/Way** of purity and tranquility, yet why do they enforce punishments and killings to instill fear of death?\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The people do not fear death because the governance of the state is harsh, leaving them barely able to survive. Those who govern themselves are harmed by their cravings, while greed for wealth destroys their lives—yet the people do not know to fear these things. Why then do rulers threaten them with death, instead of lightening their punishments and teaching them to abandon their desires? Why set punishments and threaten death?\n\n○ **Yán** said: Human nature, when content, finds peace; when discontented, it schemes wrongly. In destitution, one scorns death; in comfort, one cherishes life. If the people’s hearts are not satisfied and their lives are not preserved, then decrees will fail to move them. The beasts of the destitute do not shun rhinoceroses or tigers—such is their nature, and the logic of their plight.\n\n○ **Róng** said: In an age of **Dao/Way**, all beings cherish life, and the **Dao/Way** of non-action makes them spare death. If one cannot pacify them with supreme **virtue/power**, yet restrains them with harsh punishments, the people will barely survive, hence the saying: *\"People do not fear death.\"* The root of people not fearing death lies in cruel punishments; it is fitting to rely on pardon, using **virtue/power** to make them forget punishments. How could one still apply harsh laws to the people, desiring they fear death? This laments the failures of the times.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation (成疏):** This condemns the common delusion of passion, deeply entrenched and unrelenting. They pursue fleeting pleasures without regard for life and death, yet even with stern warnings and teachings, they remain without fear—thus the sigh of *\"Why?\"* is raised, profound and sorrowful.\n\nSecondly, it clarifies that deep crimes will surely invite suffering retribution. If the people were to constantly fear death, yet one were to act deceitfully, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? **Lord’s Annotation (御注):** If all were to follow the path of purity and restraint, daring not to wallow in passion or indulge desires, and constantly feared death, yet a single deceitful one acted strangely, even if I could seize and kill them, who would dare to do so?\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** This explains how rulers guide through non-action, and the people temper their desires, each preserving their own lives, and thus fearing death. Yet if one were to act deceitfully and wickedly, and I could seize and kill them, who would dare to do so? The reason they are not killed is that there exists the **Heavenly Net** (天网) that governs retribution—thus the following text states:\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: If the people were to constantly fear death, it would be because I had removed my own acts of cruelty and taught them to abandon greed. Yet if one were to act deceitfully, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? When **Dao/Way** is used to guide, but the people do not comply, instead acting craftily, they then fall under the **King’s Law** (王法) to be seized and killed. Who would dare to offend?\n\n**Lǎo Zǐ** lamented the times when kings do not first guide with **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, but instead enforce punishments.\n\n○ **Róng** said: The deceitful are those who disrupt the order with cunning. If the age’s ruler upholds the **Dao/Way**, all preserve their lives, and this is called fearing death. Yet those who act violently and disrupt the order grow ever more deceitful and strange in their crimes. Heaven does not endure evil, so they are seized and killed. Those who truly fear death and cultivate life—who would dare to commit wrongs?\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation (成疏):** The heart of greed generates ever more deceitful schemes, firmly rooted in perversion, until it becomes their norm. The unseen judges (冥司) capture and kill them, their retribution as sharp as the wind and as evident as the scriptures. If any have insight, who would dare to create sin?\n\nThirdly, it clarifies that this suffering retribution comes from the unseen judges (冥司). There are always those who govern punishment.\n\n**Lord’s Annotation (御注):** Such deceitful ones are not spared by the **Heavenly Net**—it is the unseen judges of Heaven who kill them. It states that wicked ones are killed by the unseen judges, and rulers, using their authority, seize and kill them conveniently—this is to act as substitutes for the unseen judges.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** *Suī* (司) means \"master\" or \"official.\" Heaven’s discernment is all-pervading, nothing escapes its gaze. Deceitful ones cannot escape their deaths, for it is Heaven’s unseen judges who kill them.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The unseen judges are Heaven, which stands high and surveys all below, overseeing human transgressions. The **Heavenly Net** is vast yet not flawed—this is its nature.\n\n○ **Yán** said: The unseen judges are the great ministers. The **Dao/Way** of the emperor and king is to act without action, delegating duties to those before, behind, left, and right. Those who create calamity die, those who usurp authority perish with their clans, and all officials attend to their duties—none of it concerns the sovereign.\n\n○ **Róng** said: *Suī* (司) means \"master.\" The principles of reward and punishment are constant, and the officials of life and death have their masters. One cannot act wickedly, and those who break the law must die—yet they seek to usurp the unseen judges’ role and kill at will.\n\nFourthly, it strengthens the argument that substituting for the unseen judges will instead bring one’s own blame. To act as a substitute for the unseen judges is to act as a substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠).\n\n**Lord’s Annotation (御注):** If rulers delight in seizing and killing themselves, they will not align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** It speaks of how wicked ones are killed by the unseen judges, and rulers, using their authority, seize and kill them conveniently—this is the unseen judges killing people, yet they do not align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, just as a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is supremely clear, and the unseen judges have their constants, just as spring brings birth and summer growth, autumn harvest and winter concealment, the stars and Big Dipper shift in their courses to govern the seasons. If rulers desire to substitute for Heaven’s killing, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork—laboring without success.\n\n○ **Yán** said: The one who substitutes for the unseen judges is the ruler. When officials lose their proper function, governance collapses. When the sovereign takes on self-renewal, skilled laborers fold their hands idle. When the ruler takes on killing, officials lose their proper roles.\n\n○ **Róng** said: To substitute for the unseen judges is to substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands. Though Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is distant, its mysterious discernment is profound and clear. Rewarding the virtuous and punishing the wicked is recorded in the unseen judges. Spring brings birth and summer growth, clearly manifest in the seen substitutes. If temporal governance cannot fulfill its role in accordance with Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and instead substitutes with human effort, it also strays from the **Dao/Way**.\n\nYet even so, most stubborn people are few in following transformation, and many deceitful flaws are difficult to prevent. Adjusting measures according to the times, establishing laws and ordinances, there are those in charge of punishment and officials in charge of killing. If they do not delegate to their proper authorities, and killing is not carried out by its proper officials, but those who usurp killing—it is like a clumsy man substituting for a skilled artisan, bound to bring injury to their hands. Though few may escape injury, those injured will be many.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** To substitute for the unseen judges is to substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands. All beings create karma and reap their due retribution. Punishments and suffering belong to the unseen judges. The unenlightened, acting from arrogance, presumptuously substitute for the unseen judges in executing punishments—how different is this from an ordinary, clumsy artisan substituting for a master carpenter in woodwork? A clumsy artisan, working beyond their capacity, not only fails in their task but also injures their hands. To forcibly substitute for the unseen judges is the same—it is not merely an abuse of duty but invites disaster. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands.\n\n**Lord’s Annotation:** A clumsy man substituting for woodwork—how could he avoid injuring the village [community]? He would also injure his own hands. When a ruler assumes the role of punishment, substituting for the unseen judges, how could he avoid harming the people while also losing Heaven’s harmony?\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork moves in accordance with the square and round. A clumsy man substituting for him must deviate from the plumb line and level. Could one’s heart not be harmed by the village [community] while injuring their hands? Heaven’s net does not fail, and divine principles are manifest. If a ruler assumes punishment, substituting for the unseen judges, how could he avoid harming the people while losing Heaven’s harmony? Why does he act with such disregard for death?\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: When a ruler enforces punishments, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork—then the square and round will not align, and he will harm himself. To substitute for Heaven in killing is to lose the proper order; if the proper order is lost, he will suffer the consequences.\n\n○ **Yán** said: When skilled laborers fold their hands idle, the great hall cannot be built. When a ruler monopolizes killing, the world loses its proper order. If the great hall cannot be built, there will be no shelter for descendants. If the world loses governance, the state cannot be secure. The chapter on people’s hunger follows the previous one, as the previous chapter clearly establishes that beings with deep karmic guilt must reap suffering. This chapter then explains why such suffering is incurred—due to attachment to worldly actions. Within this chapter, three themes unfold: first, explaining why beings lack virtue due to attachment to worldly affairs; second, why beings shorten their lives due to excessive focus on sustenance; third, demonstrating the beauty of forgetting life to guide learners.\n\n**First, explaining why beings lack virtue due to attachment to worldly affairs:**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** and virtue are forgotten when one indulges in worldly pursuits, and thus one attains the leisure of the fish in the lake. As for the benevolent influence of Emperor Wén and Emperor Xīn, the enlightened governance of King Chéng and King Kāng—these were indeed praised as the great blessings of the Zhou. Yet during the Han, when the state was governed by law, the *lǔ* arrows came from the east, and divine forces were invoked from the west. The four classes lived in peace, the people lived without strife, and tribute included eight layers of silk. The fields yielded double harvests of rice, gentle winds blew morning and evening, sweet dew fell in the courtyards. The crown prince’s virtue was abundant in the Green Palace, and ministers assisted in the **Dao/Way** at the Red Gate. Heaven was balanced, Earth was upright, lawsuits ceased, and punishments were clear. The people of Yáo’s time could be sealed in their homes, and those of Shùn’s era thrived in their courtyards. They enjoyed the joy of proper governance—how could there be taxes from hunger? They did not die lightly, and with the sage’s teaching of non-action, they found their own ease.\n\nThe people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason the people of the world suffer hunger and want is that their rulers consume too much in taxes.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** People are the foundation of the state. If governance is burdensome and taxes are heavy, the people will become impoverished, and the foundation will decay—decay leads to danger. Thus, the people’s insufficiency comes from the ruler consuming too much in taxes, causing their hunger and want.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. The reason the people suffer hunger and cold is that their rulers consume too much in taxes, hence their hunger. Therefore, the people blame their rulers for greed, abandoning the **Dao/Way** and virtue, and thus they suffer hunger.\n\n○ **Róng** said: When the common people are hungry and the four classes are impoverished, it is not due to other causes—taxes are heavy and levies are excessive.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** It says the people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. Hunger refers to lacking inner virtue. \"Upper\" refers to the heart, which governs the five viscera and a hundred actions, hence called \"upper.\" Taxes mean accumulation, and \"food\" refers to tastes. It states that practitioners ruin their virtue by indulging in sensory pleasures. Hence, they suffer hunger—connecting with the previous meaning.\n\nThe difficulty in governing the people arises because their rulers engage in worldly affairs, hence the difficulty in governing them. **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason the people of the world are difficult to govern and transform is that their rulers engage in worldly affairs, making governance difficult and deceitful schemes prevalent.\n\n「○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The teeming masses rely on their ruler for governance, for governance is rooted in *wuwei* (無為). Thus, when I practice *wuwei*, the people naturally transform themselves.\n\nYet the reason people are difficult to govern today is that their rulers engage in worldly affairs. When rulers act, governance becomes burdensome and the people are disturbed; every action spawns great deceit, hence the difficulty in governing them.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:** The people are difficult to govern because their rulers engage in worldly affairs. The people cannot be governed because their rulers are consumed by desires and fond of worldly actions, hence the difficulty in governing them.\n\n○ **Yán (严) says:** Thus, the people emulate the ruler’s worldly affairs, and their deceitful inclinations make them difficult to govern.\n\n○ **Róng (荣) says:** Worldly actions disrupt the natural order, making governance difficult. When the ruler aligns with *wuwei* (無為), the people naturally transform.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** The people are difficult to govern because their ruler engages in worldly affairs, causing all actions to stray and multiply in chaotic ways. This is because the heart indulges in worldly pursuits—when the heart practices *wuwei*, all actions become easy to govern. Thus, one knows that all phenomena rest in the mind alone.\n\nHence, the difficulty in governing—this concludes the previous meaning.\n\n**Secondly, it illustrates why beings shorten their lifespan: excessive attachment to life.**\n\nThe people’s disregard for death stems from their relentless pursuit of life—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The people of the world lightly embrace death because they violate natural limits in their excessive pursuit of life, hence they meet their end.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason people lightly court death and lose their lives is that they violate natural limits, indulging in excessive nourishment and life-preservation. They disregard the law’s penalties, recklessly pursuing their desires—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life. The people lightly transgress against death because they cling to ways of sustaining life, greedily seeking profit to endanger themselves—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\n○ **Yán says:** It is because of their excessive pursuit of life that they lightly court death.\n\n○ **Róng says:** Those who cling to life suppress their true nature with false desires, while those who lightly embrace death are ensnared by deluded cravings, clinging to the transient body as if it were eternal. Hence, it speaks of the excessive pursuit of life. Excessive means accumulation, abundance—when affairs accumulate, the mind is disordered; when tastes multiply, vitality wanes. Unable to cherish life with caution, they squander themselves through indulgence and lightly court death.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive attachment to life. Practitioners who do not fulfill their natural lifespan and lightly court death are those who remain entangled in delusion, failing to awaken. They do not comprehend that all phenomena, including life, are illusory—life is but the absence of death. Yet they burden themselves with excessive demands on the six senses and overindulge in the four elements—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\nThis concludes the previous meaning.\n\n**Thirdly, it demonstrates the beauty of forgetting life, urging scholars to reflect.**\n\nIndeed, those who do not excessively cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** When natural sustenance is sufficient, life is preserved. If one overnourishes beyond natural limits, life is lost. Thus, those who do not excessively cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** Life has its bounds—contentment is enough, yet one must neither defy nor overreach them. If one pursues life beyond its proper measure, confusion follows. Thus, not clinging to life preserves it, while excessive pursuit destroys it. Hence, one knows that those who do not make life their concern are wiser than those who vainly prize it.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says:** Only those who do not make life their primary concern—who remain untouched by rank and wealth, who do not covet profit or power—can be said to be wiser than those who prize life.\n\n○ **Yán says:** The natural Dao always opposes artificiality. The lifeless attain life, while the living cling to life and meet death. Those who pursue life for its gains are the origin of death; those who abandon life’s attachments are the beginning of true life. Not clinging to others’ concerns brings peace; not clinging to life brings longevity.\n\n○ **Róng says:** Heaven grants life as a finite reality, yet excessive nurturing beyond its measure harms it—this is failing to truly cherish life. Those who grasp the supreme Dao perceive the body as illusory, understanding that governance is lifeless. They do not cling to false forms, naturally releasing the burdens of attachment. They align with emptiness and coldness, harmonizing with virtue, sharing in the Dao’s root. Though they do not nourish life, life nourishes itself—this is truly cherishing life.\n\nWise (*xián*, 賢) means virtuous; prizing (*guì*, 貴) means valuing.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** Wise (*xián*, 賢) means good. Those who attain profound insight do not extinguish sensory existence but instead practice *zuòwàng* (坐忘), realizing life’s formless nature. Hence, those who are repelled by vulgarity and disdain worldly pleasures—who alone do not make life their primary concern—are truly virtuous in safeguarding and valuing life.\n\n**Chapter on the Lifespan of Human Beings**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior illustrates how those who cling to life ultimately court death, while those who forget life achieve longevity. Thus, this chapter explains that gentle and weak beings naturally attain longevity, while the rigid and strong perish early. To distinguish excellence from mediocrity, this is why it follows.\n\nThis chapter’s meaning is divided into three parts: first, it presents two paired analogies to contrast life and death in the strong and weak; second, it unites the analogies to argue their superiority and inferiority; third, it uses the analogies and further elaboration to reinforce the meaning.\n\n**First, it presents two paired analogies to contrast life and death in the strong and weak.**\n\nThe *Nánchāng* (南昌) adjusts its course, bestowing life on the weak and frail. The *Běidì* (北帝) of *Āngdū* (酆都) holds the register of death, seizing the strong and mighty. The heavens favor the light and yielding, long preserving the moistness of clouds and winds, while the earth’s terrain is solid and enduring—only the sound of metal and stone is heard. Solidity can be shattered, while yielding never stagnates. When the supreme Dao governs, the weak naturally dwell in the lower currents, while the strong suffer mutilation as an omen of misfortune, eye-gouging as a fate of rebellion. Jié Lì (截离) deceived them—why did he kill his own son for another? Dào Zhì (盗婿) was foolish—why did he defy his father and brother, boasting of his valor? Do they not know that all phenomena are transient, and humility and yielding prevail? Without relying on divination, they naturally follow the Dao like Sūn Zhū (孙叔). The waters swirl in the hollows, and withered leaves scatter like wind. The *Jìn Bì* (晋鄙) was buried with an iron hammer, and *Jì Lún* (季伦) met his end with a golden axe. Regret comes too late—whose fault is this?\n\nBetter to preserve true purity in tranquil stillness,\nwhere fame and gain are utterly severed—\nhonor and splendor as fleeting as spring dreams,\nwealth and nobility like passing clouds—\nthen the gentle and yielding attain longevity,\nwhile the empty-hearted ascend as immortals.\n\nHuman life begins in yielding softness,\nyet ends in rigid strength.\n**Commentary:** When life begins, it is soft and weak;\nwhen death comes, it is stiff and hard.\nAll things—grasses and trees—are tender when they grow,\nyet wither and decay when they die.\nThus, those who are rigid and strong are doomed to death,\nwhile those who are yielding and weak belong to life.\n\nThe yielding softness of life preserves the harmony of *qi*.\nThe rigid strength of death scatters the harmony of *qi*.\nTo clarify: those who guard their yielding softness\npreserve life and extend years.\nThose who rely on rigid strength\nlose their bodies and their nature.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nWhen life begins, the harmony of *qi* flows through all limbs,\nmaking the body soft and weak.\nWhen death comes, the harmony of *qi* disperses,\nand the limbs grow stiff and strong.\nThis is shown to teach that yielding softness and rigid strength\nare the warnings of life and death.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nWhen life begins, it is soft and weak—\nthe harmony of *qi* is contained within,\nand the spirit is embraced.\nWhen death comes, it is rigid and strong—\nthe harmony of *qi* is exhausted,\nand the spirit departs.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nNothing is softer and weaker than *qi*,\nand nothing is softer and weaker than the Dao.\nThus, when humans are born, they must rely on the Dao.\nIf *qi* is preserved, bending and stretching are as one’s will;\nif the Dao is upheld, movement and stillness follow the spirit.\nThe heart obeys without resistance,\nand all actions proceed without obstruction—\nthus is yielding softness spoken of.\nIf one cannot preserve *qi*, it will be exhausted,\nand the body will perish.\nIf one does not nurture the spirit, it will depart,\nand life will end—\nand when life ends, the body perishes,\nand movement becomes impossible—\nthus is rigid strength spoken of.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**\nWhen life begins, it is soft and weak;\nwhen death comes, it is rigid and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—are soft and tender when they live,\nyet wither and decay when they die.\nThis is because when alive, the harmony of *qi* is present,\nand when dead, the harmony of *qi* departs.\nThis analogy of sentient and insentient beings\nis meant to exhort learners to abandon rigidity and embrace yielding.\n\n**Second Analogy, Distinguishing Superiority and Inferiority:**\nAll things—grasses and trees—are soft and tender when they grow,\nyet wither and decay when they die.\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThis is an analogy.\nWhen things grow, *qi* gathers, and their branches and leaves unfold in softness.\nWhen they die, *qi* is exhausted, and their stems and branches wither and decay.\nEarlier, the sentient was explained;\nnow, the insentient is illustrated.\nThe insentient thrive or decay by the gathering or scattering of *qi*,\nwhile the sentient live or die by the presence or absence of the Dao.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nWhen grasses and trees grow, they are soft and tender—\nthe harmony of *qi* is present.\nWhen they die, they wither—\nthe harmony of *qi* departs.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nInsentient things live because they have *qi*,\nand die because they lack it.\nThus, it is known that sentient beings\nretain life through yielding softness and the Dao,\nand fall into rigidity and strength when they lose it.\nThus, those who are rigid and strong are doomed to death,\nwhile those who are yielding and weak belong to life.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThis concludes the earlier meaning.\nSince grasses and trees are soft and tender when alive,\nyet rigid and strong when dead,\nit is clear that those who act with rigid strength\nare of the class of death,\nwhile those who act with yielding softness\nare of the class of life.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nObserving these two cases,\none knows that rigid strength leads to death,\nwhile yielding softness leads to life.\n\n**Yan (严) says:**\nWhen life begins, it is soft and weak—\nthe spirit dwells within the body,\nand blood and *qi* flow freely,\nmaking bones weak and sinews supple,\nso that movement and stillness, bending and stretching,\nare all effortless.\nWhen death comes, the spirit departs from the body,\nand the form withers like a dried orange.\nThe tongue shrinks, the body stiffens—\nthis is rigidity and strength.\nAgain, yielding softness is like infancy,\nwhile rigidity and strength are like youth—\nwhen blood and *qi* are at their peak,\ndecay and old age approach,\nbones wither, sinews tighten,\nappetite fades,\nand death is near.\nRigidity and strength lead to ruin,\nwhile yielding softness grows stronger each day.\nHumans are thus, and so are grasses and trees.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nThis concludes the distinction between sentient and insentient,\nlife and death,\neach with their own categories.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**\n\"Category\" here means \"kind.\"\nThus, those who act with rigid strength\ncontradict the harmony of nature,\nand so belong to the class of death.\nThose who act with yielding softness\nalign with the harmony of *qi*,\nand so belong to the class of life.\nThis is the analogy.\n\n**Third Method: Presenting the Affliction and Reinforcing the Earlier Meaning:**\nThus, armies that rely on strength do not conquer.\n**Commentary:** Those who pity prevail,\nso those who depend on strength must fail.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThis continues to reinforce the earlier meaning.\nIn warfare, it is said that mercy is the foundation,\nhence, \"armies that rely on strength are ineffective.\"\nThis is to show that those who rely on strength in life\nare doomed to die.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nStrong armies are reckless in battle,\ndelight in killing,\nand spread hatred and resentment.\nThe weak unite against them,\nand thus the strong do not conquer.\n\n**Yan (严) says:**\nEnemies who rely on strength\nplunder lands and wealth,\ndestroy ancestral temples,\nand ruin the state,\nseeking to display their might.\nThose who oppose them die,\nand those who serve them face ruin.\nIn life, they are a scourge to the world;\nin death, they benefit the world.\nThe weak unite against them,\nand the strong are isolated—\nthus, they do not conquer.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nThus, armies that rely on strength do not conquer,\nand rigid trees are prone to splitting.\nIf one does not rely on virtue to endure,\nbut instead depends on arms for strength,\nthen strength becomes a scourge to the world,\nand killing is what all detest.\nThe few unite against the many,\nand the weak support the weak—\nthus, the strong are attacked from all sides,\nand do not conquer.\nThis is why rigid trees split,\nand strong pillars collapse beneath their weight.\nThrough such analogies,\nit is made clear that one should cultivate virtue\nand embrace yielding softness,\nrather than adorn oneself with arms and rigidity.\n\n**○ Cheng Shu’s Commentary:**\nThus, armies that are strong do not conquer, and rigid trees are prone to collapse—*armies* referring to the Three Poisons and the Six Roots. It speaks of those who indulge the Six Passions, violently oppress others, and take without restraint—such men will inevitably suffer grave calamity and ruin, hence they do not conquer.\n\nLike coarse, rigid trees, their branches press downward upon them, just as grand beams and rafters bear weight above. Thus, rigidity invites collapse.\n\n**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**\nThe root of the tree is strong and great, so it rests below, while the branches, being supple and weak, grow above. This is why the weak and yielding occupy the upper position, while the strong and rigid are beneath.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nIt states: *\"The root of the tree is strong and great, so it rests below; the branches, being supple and weak, grow above.\"* This is taken to mean that the weak and yielding occupy the upper position, while the strong and rigid are beneath—that is why the following passage states as such.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe tree is strong and great, yet its branches grow above it. The strong and great are beneath, while the weak and yielding are above.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nThis concludes the meaning of the previous passage—that the root of the tree is strong and great, yet its branches grow above it. It seeks to illustrate that those who are strong and rigid are always beneath the weak and yielding.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen constructing works and achieving feats, great trees are placed below, while lesser things are placed above. This is the natural order of Heaven—suppressing the strong and aiding the weak.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe Dao of the Divine and Mysterious: the small does not bear the great, the light does not bear the heavy. Why? Because the strong man is a burden to the world. Strong trees, rooted below, wither from the base—this clearly shows that the strong man cannot become king.\n\n**Rong says:**\nLife is what all delight in; the weak and yielding are the companions of life—are they not above? Death is what all lament; the firm and strong are the companions of death—are they not below?\n\n**Cheng Shu:**\nFirm and strong trees dwell beneath, while supple branches rise above. Thus, the firm and strong man resides in the Nine Abysses below, while the weak and yielding scholar ascends to the Three Purities above.\n\n---\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded on the superiority and inferiority of hardness and softness, urging people to learn. Thus, this chapter further elucidates the principles of gain and loss in hardness and softness to encourage study. Within this chapter, the meaning is divided into three parts: first, an introductory analogy illustrating high and low; second, a direct exposition expounding on gain and loss; third, citing the Sage to conclude the meaning.\n\n**First: The Introductory Analogy, Briefly Illustrating High and Low**\nThe common folk are ignorant; direct speech is difficult to grasp. One must use analogies to make it clear. The Dao of Heaven is boundless and intangible, beyond the reach of human perception. To comprehend its intent, consider the archer’s bow: whether high or low, it strikes true; whether near or far, it finds its mark. Zhang Heng’s skill moved the wind and birds ten thousand *li* away; Emperor Wu’s talent startled the clouds and geese across three autumns. They respond to the moment, never missing their mark. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive, while human affairs reduce the deficient. Heaven and man employ opposite methods—gain and loss diverge. Who can fathom the primordial *qi*, vast and unfathomable, the Mysterious Origin, remote and boundless? Within it lies true stillness, yet transformation arises spontaneously. It does not rely on man to aid Heaven, nor does it depend on the mind to diminish the Dao.\n\nSoaring nine *wan* *li* on the wind, the Great Peng flies freely; plunging three thousand *li* into the waters, the *Kun* swims alone. Speaking of the bow and arrows, all shots find their mark; speaking of suppression and elevation, none exceed their place. Like the *xiao* flute, when Princess Pingyu plays, the floating clouds are ensnared; like the *qin* zither, when played by the Maoshan recluse, flowing waters become melody. This is the harmony of heart and reason, attainable and complete—only the man of the Dao can grasp its profound mystery.\n\nIs not the Dao of Heaven like the archer’s bow?\n\n**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao of Heaven is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the archer’s bow is cited to reveal its function.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nHere, two analogies are employed. The Dao of Heaven is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the archer’s bow is used to manifest Heaven’s virtue. The method of the bow is fully explained below.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and clear; it employs analogies from things to make itself known.\n\n**Rong says:**\nHuman affairs are near and shallow; one faces them yet cannot discern their essence. The Dao of Heaven is distant and deep; one gazes upward yet cannot perceive its principles. The confused are easily enlightened, but the true path is difficult to understand. Thus, the analogy of the archer’s bow is borrowed to illustrate it.\n\n**Cheng Shu:**\nThe Dao of Heaven—is it not like the archer’s bow? Those who are high are suppressed, those who are low are elevated—this is the analogy. The natural order, like the bow, raises the low to make them high and suppresses the high to make them low. Only when high and low are properly balanced can the arrow be released.\n\nThose who are high are suppressed, those who are low are elevated; the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\n\n**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**\nThe bow must be drawn thus to strike true—just as the Dao of Heaven, through humility and moderation, seeks to guide the ruler in harmonizing with Heaven and people.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nThe bow’s function requires proper tension and alignment, ensuring the bowstring is neither too tight nor too slack. To suppress the high and elevate the low is to prepare the arrow for its true path. To diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient is to adjust for distance—thus, the shot finds its mark.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is the same: the sun and moon, cold and heat, come and go in turn. When they come, they diminish the excessive; when they depart, they supplement the deficient—thus, the year’s work is complete.\n\nThe ruler must follow the Dao of Heaven: suppress the strong, aid the weak, diminish the advantageous, and benefit the disadvantaged. Thus, the principles of humility and moderation are held up, urging the ruler to govern with equity and balance.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nIt speaks of the bow’s harmonious balance—only thus can it be used. To suppress the high and elevate the low, to diminish the strong and supplement the weak—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe bow’s function lies in harmony. If the bowstring is too taut, it must be loosened; if too slack, it must be tightened.\n\nThe rest is thus: carve away the excessive, and supplement what is deficient. When the bowstring and arrow shaft align in their proper measure, harmony is achieved—thus, the bow can be drawn and the arrow released.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe Way of using the bow is this: if it is too high, suppress it so it does not exceed; if too low, elevate it so it does not fall short. Neither exceeding nor falling short—this is the middle standard.\n\nFor those who govern the realm, they must diminish the excessive wealth of the rich and augment the deficient wealth of the poor. The poor, receiving aid, are no longer poor; the rich, though diminished, remain rich—this is the middle standard of governance.\n\nToo high risks emptiness and distance; suppress it so it does not become void. Too low risks stagnation and obstruction; elevate it so it does not become blocked. Neither blocked nor void—this aligns with the **Middle Dao**.\n\n**The Second Proper Explanation: Broadly Clarifying Diminish and Supplement.**\nThe excessive must be diminished; the deficient must be given to.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\nThose who are arrogant and proud with excess must invite ruin; those who are humble and meek with deficiency will be granted blessings. The Dao of Heaven is thus, and so it is likened to drawing the bow.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThe Great Dao applies equity, aiding the many and benefiting the few. But humanity reverses this, diminishing the deficient instead.\n\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nThis clarifies how humanity cannot match Heaven’s diminish and supplement. The words *\"aid the many and benefit the few\"* are from the *I Ching*’s **\"Qian\" (谦, Humility) Hexagram**.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and benefits the humble, always valuing harmony and moderation as supreme.\n\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so—it opposes the Dao of Heaven.\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Common folk diminish the poor to serve the rich, plunder the weak to benefit the strong.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient, using Heaven’s Dao as an analogy.\n\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so—it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. This speaks of how humanity’s actions oppose Heaven’s Dao: instead of diminishing the strong and benefiting the weak, it extinguishes the poor and increases the rich.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient. This is the natural principle of bestowing blessings upon the virtuous and calamities upon the licentious, continuing from what was said earlier.\n\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so—it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. In human affairs, the inclination is to indulge in licentiousness and deceit, to vie with others in worldly pursuits, thus opposing Heaven’s Dao and reason. They strip the poor and lowly of what little they have, offering it to the wealthy and noble who already possess excess.\n\nWho can truly use their own excess to benefit all under Heaven? Only the **Daoist ruler**.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nWho can use their own excess to aid those deficient across the world? Only the **Daoist ruler** can do so.\n\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\n*Who*—meaning *who among men*? The **Laozi** laments that the age cannot follow Heaven’s Dao, yet he seeks to relieve humanity. He magnifies the **Daoist ruler’s virtue**, thus citing Heaven’s Dao to exhort: Who can practice Heaven’s Dao, diminishing their own excess to bestow upon those deficient? Only the **Daoist ruler** can achieve this.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWho can occupy a position of excess and reflect upon their rank and wealth to aid those deficient across the world? Only the **Daoist ruler** can carry this out.\n\n**Rong says:**\nWho can model their conduct after Heaven’s Dao, diminishing the excessive and supplementing the humble? The **Daoist ruler** must be capable of such actions.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\n*Who*—meaning *who among men*? Who can possess both wealth and virtue to bestow upon all under Heaven? Only those who embrace the Dao can truly aid others, hence the following line: *\"The Sage does not accumulate.\"*\n\nAnd it says *\"to serve\"*—this is to show humility.\n\n**The Third Proper Explanation: Illustrating the Sage and Concluding the Meaning.**\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage follows Heaven’s Dao, applying equity and balance in his actions. His virtue extends to all, yet he does not claim credit for his deeds.\n\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nThis introduces the Sage to validate the earlier notion of the **Daoist ruler**. *\"Rely on\"* means *\"to boast or take pride in.\"* The Sage, following Heaven’s Dao and applying equity, extends his virtue to all without seeking recognition, hence *\"does not rely.\"*\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Sage acts in virtue and benevolence, not awaiting reward or acknowledgment.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it—his achievements are not his own, and so he is not esteemed for his wisdom. The Sage acts in virtue without expecting reward, accomplishes things without claiming credit—this is why he does so: to conceal his **sage virtue** and obscure his **accomplished talent**, lest the people see his wisdom and ability. Since the ruler acts thus, the subjects follow suit, and the strife for renown is naturally removed; the concern for being overlooked ceases to arise.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it—his achievements are not his own. He does not wish to display his wisdom.\n\nThe Sage, embodying the Dao, is always good at rescuing and benefiting others. Though he bestows both wealth and virtue, he does not rely on his efforts. Even with great accomplishments, he does not claim credit—his intent is to exalt humility, to retreat from glory, and to conceal his light and obscure his traces, not desiring that others see his wisdom and ability.\n\n**Achievements without claiming credit.**\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage knows that if he claims credit for his achievements, Heaven will diminish them. Thus, even though his Dao spreads across the world and his deeds benefit all, he attributes the praise to the common people, yet does not claim the credit himself.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen achievements are complete and matters are settled, he does not hold onto his position. He does not wish to display his wisdom.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis concludes the meaning of *\"does not rely\"* and *\"does not claim.\"* He who does not wish to display his wisdom—though the Sage may possess abundant inner virtue and fine outward reputation—his reason for not relying on his actions or claiming credit is precisely to conceal his virtue and obscure his name, not desiring that others see his wisdom and ability. This is also the meaning of *\"diminishing the excessive.\"*\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nHe does not desire that people know his own virtue—he conceals his achievements and does not dwell upon them.\n\n**Rong says:**\nHe fears Heaven and diminishes the excessive.\n\n**End of *Dao De Jing* (玄德慕疏卷之十九) and *Dao De Jing* (纂疏卷之二十).**\n*Commentaries on the Dao De Jing by He Shang Gong (严君平), Rong (李荣), and Master Cheng of Xi Hua (西华成玄英), compiled by Qiang Si of Meng Yang (蒙阳强思齐).*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 78: The Soft and the Weak**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which debated the merits of strength and softness. Since the prior chapter expounded on diminishing and augmenting, this chapter uses water as an analogy to illustrate the power of softness and weakness.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning unfolds in three parts: first, the analogy begins, clarifying that softness excels strength and weakness overcomes force; second, the analogy is applied, lamenting the common inability to practice it; third, the Sage is cited as proof, demonstrating the true Dao.\n\n**First, the analogy begins, clarifying that softness excels strength and weakness overcomes force:**\nThe highest virtue is humble and soft—nothing surpasses water. The great artisan takes his standard from it; the virtuous person’s mind flows like water toward the east into rivers, while Confucius marveled at its ceaseless passage. The southern currents converge at the lowly ditches, and Guo Pu praised its boundless spirit.\n\nWhen autumn waters first rise, they cannot distinguish between cattle and horses; when winter ice first forms, it listens to the calls of foxes and rabbits. Crossing the Yellow River in a small boat, returning to the sea upon a raft. The virtue of softness and weakness triumphs over hardness and strength—white stones boil in cauldrons of stone until they turn to mud, yellow gold is refined into powder by water’s embrace. All these are the power of water, unmatched by any, making it the sovereign of the world. It must be called *\"lonely and solitary\"* (孤寡), bearing the filth of the land, yet truly it is auspicious.\n\nSpeaking of fish, they do not wish their bodies to grow fat; riding cranes, one must have a slender frame. The noble person exchanges with others in simplicity to compare virtue, while the spirit of clarity is marked by pouring and measuring. A loyal subject can summon wind and rain, and a virtuous wife, if reverent and filial, will have the courtyard fountain flow of itself.\n\nOh, how vast is water’s meaning!\n\nWhen one acts, he must dwell in tranquility and harmony, not imposing himself upon others. He must yield and adapt, following the Way of things. Water’s nature is pure and reflective—how can I not take virtue from it?\n\n**The soft and the weak of the world have none greater than water.**\nYet in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can surpass it.\n\n**Tang Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary:**\nTo break hardness with hardness, both must be diminished. But when softness strikes strength, the strong are broken while the soft remain whole. Thus, in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can rival water.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nWater’s nature is to descend without contention, moving or still according to the time, conforming to square or round vessels. Therefore, when speaking of the soft and the weak of the world, none surpass water. Yet in overcoming hardness and strength, water cannot be rivaled—though water is soft, it can erode stone, and though stone is hard, it cannot harm water. If hardness attacks hardness, both are damaged; if water attacks stone, stone is worn away while water remains unharmed. Hence, in overcoming hardness and subduing strength, nothing precedes water—this is why it is said that none can surpass it.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe soft and the weak of the world have none greater than water—when contained in a round vessel, it is round; when in a square vessel, it is square. Block it, and it stops; unblock it, and it flows. Yet in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can surpass it. Water can embrace mountains and nourish hills, wear away iron and dissolve copper—none can overcome water and achieve success.\n\n**Rong says:**\nObserving all things, summarizing all existence, the ultimate soft and weak is water. It dissolves gold and stone, breaks hills and mounds—none can surpass water. In the method of breaking hardness and strength, since water is supreme, there is none to replace it. For governing the body, if one can take humility as virtue and the Dao as application, he can surely break strong adversaries and vanquish the fierce. The Dao must come first, so there is none to replace it. In cultivating oneself, if one can uphold the utmost softness and weakness, he can break the hard and strong. I grasp the principle of dwelling in emptiness and stillness, surpassing all disputes of right and wrong, and only the Dao can prevail—none can substitute for it.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nNo thing is as soft and weak as water, and no hardness and strength surpasses gold and stone. Yet water, though soft and weak, has boundless utility, and in overcoming hardness and strength, it is unmatched. The principle of breaking the hard with the soft is the same—its meaning is timeless.\n\nThere is none to replace it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThough water is the softest, in overcoming hardness and strength, none can replace it. Is this not because it possesses the virtue of non-contention and lacks the desire to hold onto victory? Governing the state and cultivating oneself must also be so.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nIn overcoming hardness and strength, there is none to replace water.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWater can naturally overcome hardness and strength—this is the unchanging principle of breaking the hard with the soft, a truth that will never fade through the ages.\n\n**Second, the analogy is applied, lamenting the common inability to practice it:**\nThough softness overcomes strength and weakness triumphs over force, the world knows it not, nor can it practice it.\n\n**Tang Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary:**\nThe Dao of softness and weakness surpasses that of hardness and strength, yet the world knows it not and cannot practice it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThe Dao of softness and weakness surpasses that of hardness and strength. All people know this principle, but they are confused by their own perceived superiority, valuing themselves above others, and cannot put into practice what they already know. This is why it is said that they cannot practice it.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe triumph of weakness over strength is seen in how water extinguishes fire and how darkness consumes light. The victory of softness over hardness is seen in how the tongue, soft yet flexible, precedes the rigid teeth—teeth are broken before the tongue perishes. The world knows this well: weakness endures, while strength and force are injured. Yet none can practice it, for they are ashamed of humility and prefer the glory of force.\n\n**Rong says:**\nMany favor strength and force, few preserve softness and weakness—they cannot retreat in humility, always striving to be first among things.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWater can overcome gold and stone, so it is known that softness triumphs over hardness and strength. This is understood by both the wise and the foolish, yet all the world cannot follow it in practice.\n\nThe Third [Section] presents the Sage’s proof to establish the true Dao, demonstrating its rectitude.\n\nThus, the Sage speaks:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state is called the steward of the ancestral altars.\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**御注:**\n*\"To gather the faults of all directions is to bear the filth of the state.\nTo alone assume the titles of ‘Orphaned, Lonely, and Unworthy’ is to bear the state’s misfortunes.\nHis virtue thus established, the ancestral altars will be reverently served.\"*\n\n**御疏:**\n*\"The Sage’s words are cited to confirm the meaning above—this is the one who practices the Way of softness overcoming hardness.\nFilth (*rǔ*) means defilement and disgrace.\nIf a ruler can contain and bear defilement, taking all the world’s faults upon himself, then people will revere his virtue and not abandon him, and the ancestral altars will be served. Hence, he is called the steward of the ancestral altars.\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—*xiáng* means ‘good.’ If a ruler practices humility and softness, bearing the state’s ills and assuming the titles ‘Orphaned, Lonely, and Unworthy,’ then the Four Seas will turn toward virtue, and he is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**River Upper Master (Hé Shànggōng) says:**\n*\"Thus, the Sage speaks—this is addressing the subjects below.\nTo bear the filth of the state and uphold the ancestral altars’ master: if a ruler can bear the state’s turbid defilements, like the rivers and seas not resisting the inflow of streams, then he can long preserve the ancestral altars and be the state’s sovereign.\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—a ruler who takes faults upon himself and bears the calamities of the people can thus reign over all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**Yán says:**\n*\"To endure what others find shameful and bear it.\nWhat others hate, when it becomes the people’s great calamity, is not taken as virtue—yet if it leads to the loss of the state, it does not lose the Mandate of Heaven. If it risks one’s life, it does not lose the extinction of blessings.\nThus, if one acts this way, Heaven and Earth bow in deference, and all that is imposed upon him vanishes, while all that is plotted against him submits. All under Heaven becomes tranquil, merging into one domain, and those facing the winds and looking upward are transformed without failing to receive blessings.\"*\n\n**Róng says:**\n*\"Embodying the Way of softness and weakness, then nothing is excluded.\nAwakening to the realm of profound mystery, then no matter is left unaccommodated.\nTo contain what is rejected and suppress what is evil is to bear the state’s filth.\nTo blame oneself and take responsibility is to bear the state’s misfortunes.\nThis suffices to be the master of all things, hence he is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.\nThese words invert the common and align with the Dao, hence it is said, ‘Rectitude in speech is as if inverted.’\nFilth (*rǔ*) is defilement; *xiáng* is goodness.\nThough one may practice self-cultivation amid defilement and purity, defilement and purity are both forgotten. Though one passes through goodness and evil, both are harmonized.\nIlluminating the original stillness of one principle, establishing that all phenomena are empty—this suffices to realize the Dao and become the Law-King.\nFrom the perspective of convention, filth and goodness are distinct, and the mind perceives them as real.\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, all is empty, hence it is said to be inverted.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Thus, the Sage bears the filth of the state and is called the steward of the ancestral altars—*guó* means ‘the domain of the state,’ and *rǔ* means ‘disgrace.’\nThe one who embodies the Dao, dwelling in the world, practices humility, softness, and weakness, reaching the point of yielding and compliance, bearing humiliation without contending with others—this is worthy of being the steward of the ancestral altars to shepherd the people.\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—thus, *bùxiáng* is the same as ‘not good.’\nThe Sage’s spiritual insight is vast and penetrating, reaching into goodness and evil. If there are misfortunes in the state, he immediately blames himself and takes the faults upon himself—this is worthy of being the sovereign of all under Heaven. The case of Tāng setting fire to his granaries to summon distant aid is an example.\nEarlier, it was said that the ancestral altars could be entrusted to the feudal lords; now, it is said that all under Heaven should belong to the sovereign of all under Heaven.\nRectitude in speech is as if inverted.\"*\n\n**御注:**\n*\"To bear the filth of the state is to be the steward of the ancestral altars; to bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven. These words, though seemingly inverted, are indeed the true rectitude—hence it is said, ‘Rectitude in speech is as if inverted.’\"*\n\n**御疏:**\n*\"This sentence concludes the preceding text.\nTo bear the state’s filth and turbidity is to be the steward of the ancestral altars; to bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven. His words contradict convention and differ from the common view, hence the Old Master elaborately explains that these are indeed true and genuine words. Though they seem inverted to the common ear, they are trustworthy in practice—but people initially perceive them as inverted.\"*\n\n**River Upper Master (Hé Shànggōng) says:**\n*\"These are the words of true rectitude; the world does not understand them, taking them for inverted speech.\"*\n\n**Yán says:**\n*\"To hold oneself lightly and others heavily, to be at ease with disgrace—this inverts conventional perception and is the true speech of governance.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"When speaking in accordance with principle, it seems to invert convention—why? The common people all love goodness and honor, yet now one bears defilement and ills, which seems inverted.\nYet the phrase ‘as if inverted’ (*rú fǎn*) aims to clarify that though it appears inverted, it is not truly so—though it seems inverted, it is not. Though it seems inverted, it is not. It constantly aligns with convention, not truly inverted, yet aligning with convention in truth.\nIt is said that the profound virtue is deep and distant, contrary to things, and only then does it reach the greatest harmony—this is its meaning.\"*\n\n**Chapter on Harmonizing Great Grievances (Chapter 79)**\nThe chapter on *Harmonizing Great Grievances* follows the previous one because the prior chapter broadly expounds on hardness and softness, yet even at its utmost, it has not fully penetrated to forgetfulness. Hence, this chapter follows, dispelling the earlier obscurity to reveal the intent of the *Double Mystery*.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning unfolds in three distinctions:\n1. Though one departs from the two extremes, one has not yet ascended to the Dao’s peak.\n2. The Sage’s empty unity and mysterious correspondence with the *Double Mystery*.\n3. The distinction between those with virtue and those without, and the difference in letting go of fixation.\n\n**First: Though one departs from the two extremes, one has not yet ascended to the Dao’s peak.**\n*\"Heaven has no favorites—if one acts, it is good. Great grievances will arise; even if harmonized, there will be no peace.\nThus, the Sage empties his heart to benefit others, holds the left contract without blame, and embraces virtue while overseeing life.\nIt is like the bright sun ascending to Heaven—all under Heaven is illuminated, and the warm breath of yang stirs the earth, making all things spring.\nThe burden of strength is vast, yet the Dao of the formless is great—how could one cling to it and merely calculate right and wrong?\"*\n\n「Though the Master of the Eastern March inclines his heart toward the Wu and Yue regions, his mind already wanders with the ambition of Jing Ke to gaze southward and emulate the valor of Yan and Qin.\nOr perhaps he laments the emptiness of Luochuan, then sings a sorrowful song at Yishui—how much like the painted beauty of the crucian carp, which stirs Zhang Han’s longing to return, or the white deer with its unbroken loyalty, which evokes Liu Cang’s remembrance of old bonds!\nOne must always attend to the roots, for noble deeds are thus exalted.\nHold the Primordial *qi* in pure unity, and do not let passion flow into the Three Evils.\nEmbody the true and tranquil stillness, and perceive the profound mysteries of the Dao.\nMany are lost in the flickering lamps of the world, while few awaken to the reflection in the mirror—this is the way to verify the Path of Eternal Life and enter its wondrous gate.\n\nTo harmonize great grievances, there will inevitably be lingering grievances.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*\"To harmonize great grievances\"* refers to the ruler’s desire to use words and teachings to reconcile the people, eliminating their passions. Hence, it is called *harmonizing great grievances*.\nThere will inevitably be lingering grievances—once a doctrine is established to guide the people, traces of it must remain, and these traces will still breed grievances. Thus, lingering grievances arise.\n\n**Further Commentary:**\nAt first, humanity was born with a pure and tranquil mind, but now they are entangled in the dusty realm, straying from the Dao and falling into corruption—all due to the influence of passions. Thus, the greatest grievance for the body is indeed passion.\n*Harmonize* means to reconcile and adjust.\nThe people, already ensnared by passion and thus giving rise to deceit, cannot be transformed by the ruler’s passive non-action. If he instead establishes doctrine and law to curb their treachery and adjust them toward harmony, it is called *harmonizing great grievances*.\nYet lingering grievances remain—once laws and doctrines are set, their traces cannot be entirely erased, and these traces will still provoke grievances. Hence, lingering grievances persist.\n\n**River Master’s Saying:**\nTo *harmonize great grievances*, one must let the killer face death and the wounder receive punishment—this is the way of mutual retaliation.\nThere will inevitably be lingering grievances, for those who enforce punishments will lose the people’s trust, and lingering grievances will extend even to the innocent.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\nTo *harmonize great grievances* is to invite lingering grievances—how can this be considered good? When all things are unified in their natural state, right and wrong dissolve. Yet when distinctions arise and conflicts ensue, great grievances take form.\nThus, rituals include the duty of repaying grievances, and laws prescribe punishments for crimes. Grievances come and go, never ceasing. If one seeks to extinguish them by reconciling and adjusting, it is to invert the natural order—making them follow what is unnatural. When people outwardly comply but inwardly resist, or speak well while harboring ill will, lingering grievances and resentments only grow. This is to invite further evil—how can it be called good?\nIf one truly desires goodness, it is better to refrain from provoking grievances. If grievances are not provoked, there is no need for reconciliation or adjustment. When both inversion and compliance are forgotten, great grievances naturally cease. Only then, when one does not know what is called good, can it be named *the utmost good*.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Grievances* are oppositions—this encompasses all distinctions of good and evil, presence and absence, and every principle that requires opposition.\nThough one may reconcile the oppositions of having and not having, achieving neither having nor not having, and thus harmonize the two extremes into a singular middle, this is still the realm of *Xuan* (the Mysterious), not yet the essence of *Double Mystery*.\nThis is a state of *non-dependence*, yet one has not yet attained *absolute non-dependence*—this is *dependence on singularity*, not yet *singularity without dependence*. Hence, lingering oppositions remain.\nHow can this be considered *the utmost good*?\n\n**Commentary:**\nOnce lingering grievances arise, how can one still claim to act in *the utmost good*?\nThe traces of laws and doctrines inevitably lead to lingering grievances—thus, how can they be called *the utmost good*? This is merely the nature of goodness in learning, striving to restore the original purity.\nIf one ascends to the transformation of pure tranquility, doing nothing and attending to nothing, the people will naturally adopt simplicity and sincerity, and the traces of lingering grievances will vanish. Only then can one truly be called *the utmost good*.\n\n**River Master’s Saying:**\nIf one person sighs in complaint, the harmony of Heaven is lost—how can reconciling grievances be considered *the utmost good*?\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*How* can this be *the utmost good*?\nThough one may abandon the two extremes, one has not yet forgotten the singular middle—thus, how can one fully attain *the utmost good*?\n\n**Second: The Sage’s empty gathering and his wondrous correspondence with the *Double Mystery*.**\n\nTherefore, the Sage holds the *Left Contract* and does not blame the people.\n**Commentary:**\n*The Left Contract* refers to the mind.\nThe mind is the *yang* repository, binding with the external realm—thus it is called the *Left Contract*.\nThe Sage knows that establishing doctrine will inevitably leave traces, and these traces will still breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he holds fast to this mind, making it pure and tranquil, and transforms the people through its power. Thus, their passions are eliminated, and they do not need to be punished—they naturally align with non-action.\n\n**Further Commentary:**\n*The Left Contract* refers to the mind.\nThe mind is the *yang* repository, binding with the external realm—thus it is called the *Left Contract*.\nThe Sage knows that establishing doctrine will inevitably leave traces, and these traces will still breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he holds fast to this mind, ensuring it does not scatter or become confused, and transforms the people through its power. Thus, their passions are eliminated, and they do not need to be punished—they naturally align with non-action.\n\n**River Master’s Saying:**\nTherefore, the Sage holds the *Left Contract*—in ancient times, the Sage held the *Left Contract*, which was a pledge of mutual trust.\nWithout written laws, they carved contracts and pledges into wood as tokens of faith.\nYet he did not blame the people—only the tokens of the *Left Contract* were enforced; no other punishments were imposed.\n\n**Yan’s Commentary:**\n*Contract* is a token of trust.\nThe Sage holds the Dao’s token and wields the virtue’s pledge, uniting them within himself and not blaming others.\nThus, when he would act, he first aligned with Heaven; when he would move, he verified with the tokens of trust.\nHe sought faults within himself, never reproached others.\nHe attributed blame to himself, never to others.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\nIn ancient times, the Sage carved contracts into wood—the ruler held the left, the subject the right—as tokens of trust.\nThey bound the people to the contracts and pledges, without further laws or punishments. Hence, it is said that the Sage did not blame the people.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Contract* signifies trust and unity.\n*The Left* signifies *yang*—life and generation.\nThe Sage’s insight into the Dao is profound, like the binding of the Mysterious—his unity of subject and object transcends these four phrases, separating himself from all hundred faults.\nThus, he attains eternal vision and longevity.»\n\nThe *Left* is held in *yi*—this is indeed *non-attachment* yet *attachment*.\n\nJust as the sovereign ordinarily grasps the left contract, by which he governs all affairs,\nthe Sage’s subtle contract embraces the world,\nthus he can rectify and guide the myriad peoples,\nyet speaks of no blame—\nfor though the Sage rectifies and guides all beings,\nhe forgets his virtue,\ntreating the people as straw dogs.\nHence, he does not demand their gratitude in return.\n\n**The Third Distinction:** The difference between *de* and *non-de* lies in *holding* and *forgetting*.\n\nThus, the virtuous ruler governs by *contract*,\nwhile the unvirtuous governs by *simplicity*.\n**Yu’s Annotation:** *Govern* means *to master*.\n*Simplicity* means *to permeate*.\nThe virtuous ruler masters the *heart-contract*,\nand thus the people transform of themselves.\nThe unvirtuous ruler, unable to empty his heart and forget himself,\nseeks only to impose laws to permeate the people—\nand where laws are made, harm arises.\nHence, he is without virtue.\n\n**Yu’s Citation:**\nThe virtuous ruler governs by *contract*—\nthe virtuous sovereign merely oversees the *contract of trust*.\nThe unvirtuous ruler governs by *simplicity*—\nthe unvirtuous sovereign abandons the *contract of trust* and oversees what is lost.\n\n**Yan’s Commentary:**\n*Simplicity* may also be read as *slaughter*.\nThe unvirtuous ruler’s governance brings disorder and chaos;\nhe does not seek faults within himself,\nbut only oversees the people’s transgressions,\ndriving them with harsh punishments—\nthus, families bear guilt and crimes abound.\nThe virtuous ruler, however, determines right and wrong within himself,\ndistinguishing black from white without action—\nbefore he moves, the world responds;\nbefore he commands, the world complies.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\n*Govern* means *to master*.\n*Contract* means *unity*.\n*Simplicity* means *dispersion*.\nThe virtuous ruler’s governance stems from his heart,\nharmonizing with the Dao of *non-action*,\nmysteriously one above, drawing all things below.\nHis trust is the *contract of unity*.\nBut if unvirtuous, he fails to practice goodness,\nneither holding to the Dao’s *contract*\nnor uniting the people—\nthus, they scatter.\nWithin, the virtuous ruler aligns with principle,\nhence *governs by contract*;\nthe unvirtuous defies truth,\nhence *governs by simplicity*.\n\n**Cheng’s Citation:**\n*Govern* means *to master*.\n*Simplicity* means *trace*.\nThe virtuous ruler’s subtle governance does not cling to names or words,\nwhile the unvirtuous, still entangled in *qi* and form,\ncannot penetrate and release—\ntheir traces remain unvanquished,\nhence *governs by simplicity*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven knows no favoritism—\nit always aligns with the virtuous.\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nTo govern by *contract* is to remain pure and unspoiled;\nto legislate is to bring decay and ruin.\nHeaven favors none—\nit aids only virtue.\nThus, the sovereign must always cultivate purity through *non-action*,\nnever legislate and create strife.\n\n**Yu’s Citation:**\nThough Heaven’s way is impartial in its bestowal,\nit does not deceive the virtuous—\nthose who govern by *contract* attain purity,\nand Heaven blesses their goodness with unending benefit.\nBut those who legislate bring harm,\nand Heaven visits calamity upon them—\nwho cannot escape?\nIs this not proof that Heaven favors none,\naiding only virtue?\n\n**He Shang Gong’s Saying:**\nThe Dao of Heaven knows no near or far—\nit aids only the virtuous,\nwhich is to govern by *contract*.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\nHeaven’s way is equal, knowing no near or far.\nThe wicked stray from the path, thus distant;\nthe virtuous draw near to truth, thus close.\nSpeaking of ultimate principle,\nit is neither distant nor near—\nonly those who practice virtue are blessed by Heaven,\nhence it is said to *aid the virtuous*.\nYet it aids the virtuous while abandoning the unvirtuous—\nthus, one knows that Heaven aids virtue,\nnot the lack thereof.\nIf one walks the path of virtue,\nvirtue naturally returns to them.\n\n**Cheng’s Citation:**\nHeaven’s true principle knows no near or far.\nThe supremely virtuous naturally harmonize with it—\nthis is the same as holding the left *contract*\nand not blaming the people.\n\n---\n**The Chapter on Small States and Few People**\nThis chapter follows the previous because,\nthough the prior displayed the two *mysteries*’ essence,\nits practice was not yet complete.\nThus, this chapter clarifies entering the great through the small.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in four layers:\nFirst, it illuminates the *xiao xue* (small learning) person,\nwho does not enter the realm of dust;\nSecond, it speaks of emptying the heart to verify principle,\nabandoning teaching and forgetting *qi*;\nThird, it returns to ancient purity,\nharmonizing light and blending with customs;\nFourth, it embodies truth and unites with the Dao,\ntranscending all comings and goings.\n\n**First Layer: The *xiao xue* Person Does Not Enter the Dusty Realm**\nIn the age of the Flaming Han,\nthe sovereign merely harmonized with *endurance and repose*;\nin the time of Xi and Nong,\npeople simply adhered to *non-action*.\nThey dwelled in caves to avoid wind and frost,\nnested in trees to evade summer’s heat.\nA woman conceived once every fifteen years,\nand lived nearly a hundred before death.\nThey died piled on kindling,\nand lived cradling their food at the breast—\nhow could there be great states claiming empire,\nsmall states claiming subjecthood,\nwhere officials did not aid in planning,\nand Feng Huo did not apply his wisdom?\nWho calculated the *shi-bo* tools,\nwho served as magistrates?\n\nThough they had boats and carriages,\nthey abandoned them by rivers and plains;\nthough they had armor and weapons,\nthey stored them away and did not use them.\nThe transformation of knotted cords was lofty,\nthe wind of *ya* music reached its peak—\nthe old died without mutual visits,\nuntil the later age of chaos and peril,\nwhen kings waged war,\nYin overthrew Xia’s governance,\nZhou invaded the Zhou dynasty,\nand Yi Yin carried a cauldron to counsel the release of Jie,\nwhile Liang Si wore a jade to deceive Qin.\nQin Shi Huang demoted King Zhou of Zhou to commoner,\nLiu Yu bound Emperor Gong of Jin to a pillar—\nministers usurped the sovereign’s power.\nAlas, who could endure it?\nHow could they know that in the age of the Great Dao,\nall embraced the transformation of *non-action*?\nComparing today to antiquity—\nhow deep the sorrow!\n\nSmall states, few people—\nlet there be *shi-bo* tools, yet unused.\n\nThe heart, when it does not seek greatness, is free from greed and rivalry.\nThe affairs, when not sought in multitude, become simple and easy.\nWhen the Way of simplicity is established,\nthen the pure winds take root.\n\nEven if there are those with talent and skill,\ncapable of leading as *shi-bo* officers,\nthere is no need to employ them.\n\n---\n**River Upper Master** said:\nThough the Sage governs a great state,\nhe still considers it small,\npracticing frugality without extravagance.\nThough the people are many,\nhe treats them as few,\nso they dare not be burdened.\n\nLet the people have *shi-bo* tools,\nand let each have their own *bu-qu* and *shi-bo* ranks,\nso that nobles and commoners do not encroach upon one another.\n\nThough there are tools for the people,\nthese tools—referring to the farmer’s implements—\nare not used, meaning they are not conscripted\nto disrupt the people’s prime seasons.\n\n---\n**Yan** said:\nA small state has narrow lands and few people,\nno unshakable foundations,\nbut only the peril of precarious reliance.\nYet if governed by the Dao,\nit can turn misfortune into blessing.\n\n---\n**Rong** said:\nThe Sage governs the state with the Way of *non-action*.\nWhether military implements are few or many—\nwhether in ranks of *bo* or *thousand*—\nthey are all unused.\nIf even small states are thus,\nhow much more so great states?\n\n---\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n\"State\" refers to the domain of the mind.\nThus, \"small state\" means the mind dwelling in simplicity,\na person of few desires—\nthis is humility.\nThe conduct of a small state with few desires:\nits \"tools\" are the six senses and ten evils as weapons.\nThough the senses are six,\ntheir uses are boundless.\nSpeaking of *shi-bo* is to cite their greater numbers,\nbut \"unused\" means to still the senses\nand not be stained by the dust of the world.\n\nLet the people hold life dear\nand not wander far.\n**御疏** said:\n\"Wander\" means to migrate.\nWhen customs return to simplicity and frugality,\ngovernment is not burdensome or harsh.\nThe people cherish their lives,\nso they hold death dear.\nThey take root in their occupations,\nseeking nothing beyond,\neach content in their dwelling,\nso they do not migrate far.\n\n---\n**River Upper Master** said:\nLet the people hold life dear—\nif the ruler can bring them benefit and remove harm,\neach attaining their place,\nthen the people will cherish life and responsibility.\nNot wandering far—\nthis is to avoid burdens,\nso the people remain settled in their occupations,\nand do not stray from their accustomed ways.\n\n---\n**Yan** said:\nEstablish them with virtue and morality,\nand the people will rejoice in life and longevity,\nnot becoming thieves or bandits.\nAt such times,\nthere are no bells and drums yet ten thousand are joyful,\nno rewards given yet ten thousand are content.\nEach remains settled in their dwelling,\nnot abandoning their homeland,\neven with a hundredfold gain,\nthey would not leave their state.\n\n---\n**Rong** said:\nWhen governance encounters crises,\npeople grow light in their regard for life.\nWhen transformation aligns with *non-action*,\npeople hold death dear.\nFathers protect their children,\nwives do not lose their husbands,\neach attains joy in their occupation and settled home,\nwith no further exile or migration.\n\n---\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\nAll actions emphasize stillness,\nknowing contentment and guarding one’s portion,\nthus attaining the fulfillment of one’s natural years,\nwithout chasing distant realms.\n\n---\n**Secondly, it clarifies the empty heart and the realization of principle,\nthe gathering of teachings and forgetting the raft.**\n\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nthere is no need to ride them.\n\n**御疏** said:\nBoats and carriages were established\nto traverse water and land,\nto aid in scarcity and surplus.\nSince there is no travel,\nboth boats and carriages are abandoned,\nwith no purpose for use.\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"In the age of supreme virtue,\nmountains have no paths or tunnels,\nmarshes have no boats or bridges.\"*\n\n---\n**River Upper Master** said:\nPure and unadorned, without indulging in ornate pursuits,\nthey do not delight in travel or amusement.\n\n---\n**The Two Rongs** said:\nWater travel requires boats,\nland travel requires carriages.\nIn the age of *non-action*,\nmountains have no paths or tunnels,\nmarshes have no boats or carriages—\ncutting off the root and discarding the branches,\nwhat need is there for riding?\n\n---\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\nBoats and carriages refer to the Three Vehicles of teaching.\nBoats float on water,\nsymbolizing teachings that ferry all beings\nacross the sea of birth and death.\nThus, the *Elevating the Mysterious Classic* says:\n*\"Long abandoned the sea of birth and death,\ncutting off the flow of greed.\"*\n\nCarriages move on land,\ntheir wheels turning,\nsymbolizing teachings that transform the vulgar into the sage.\nHaving attained the principle, one forgets the words,\nthus discarding the teachings and not using them.\n\nThough there are armor and weapons,\nthere is no need to array them.\n\n**御疏** said:\nArmies are arrayed\nto subdue the unyielding,\nto repel enemies.\nWith virtue practiced above and harmony below,\nsince hostile attacks cease,\narmor and weapons are sheathed and not deployed.\n\n---\n**River Upper Master** said:\nThere is no resentment or hatred in the world.\n\n---\n**Rong** said:\nWeapons are used to punish the rebellious,\nmartial might to quell disorder.\nSince the ruler practices the Dao above,\nthe people below love virtue,\nnaturally conforming to transformation—\nwhat need is there for arraying troops?\n\n---\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\nThough there are the \"armor and weapons\" of body and mind,\nwhen one collapses the body and sits in forgetfulness,\nthe objects and their realms become empty—\nwhat need is there for deployment?\nThis sentence reverses the earlier \"tools of *shi-bo* are unused.\"\n\nLet the people return to knotted cords for use.\n\n**御疏** said:\nIn ancient times, before writing was invented,\nknots in cords recorded events.\nThus, the *Systematic Pivot* says:\n*\"In the upper antiquity, they governed by knotted cords;\nlater sages replaced them with written contracts.\"*\nTo illustrate the age of knotted cords,\npeople were pure and unadorned.\nOnce writing emerged,\ndeceit and artifice flourished.\nNow, to make people forget emotions and desires,\nreturning to ancient simplicity,\nit is said: \"Let the people return to knotted cords for use.\"\n\n---\n**River Upper Master** said:\nAbandon artifice and return to simplicity,\ntruth without deceit.\n\n---\n**Rong** said:\nIn ancient times, before writing was created,\nknots in cords were used for governance.\nOnce writing appeared,\ncorruption grew even more severe.\nThe Sage’s teaching aims at *non-action*,\nsinging to make them abandon corruption and return to simplicity,\ndiscarding ornamentation and embracing reality.\n\n---\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\nHaving emptied the heart and realized the principle,\ndiscarded teachings and forgotten the raft,\nthus relying on knotted cords\nto demonstrate a return to the root.\nThis sentence concludes the earlier \"though there are boats and carriages, no need to ride them.\"\n\n---\n**Thirdly, it clarifies returning to antiquity and simplicity,\nharmonizing with the light and blending with customs.**\n\nLet their food be sweet,\ntheir clothing beautiful.\n\n「The *Rong*’s Commentary said:\nTo eat sweetly is to eat in moderation—moderation makes all food sweet.\nTo dress beautifully is to wear appropriately—appropriateness makes all clothing beautiful.\nIf not moderate and fitting, even jade-like delicacies and brocade garments\ncannot truly be called sweet and beautiful.\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Sweet their food\"* means sweet their coarse meals,\nnot plundering the people for fine cuisine.\n*\"Beautiful their clothing\"* means beautiful their rough garments,\nnot prizing the five colors.\n\n**Rong** said:\nSweet their food, beautiful their clothing,\nsettle their dwellings, delight in their customs—\nwhen people’s desires are unfulfilled,\neven jade food and silk brocade are not deemed beautiful.\nBut when the heart finds contentment,\nplain rice and coarse hemp robes suffice as sweetness.\nLet **Tao Sheng** and **Da Jun** transform the world,\nand all shall eat sweetly without distinction of rank.\nClothing shall have no preference for good or ill,\nall garments worn shall be deemed beautiful.\nHomes shall know no poverty or wealth,\nall dwellings shall be deemed settled.\nVillages shall know no excess or want,\nall abodes shall be filled with joy.\nSince none seek distant migration,\nthe weak and bereaved shall find no need to wander.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n*\"Sweet their food\"*—flavor attains the Dao.\n*\"Beautiful their clothing\"*—virtue/power shines in the body.\n*\"Settle their dwellings\"*—delight in their customs.\nThe *Rong*’s Commentary said:\nWithout desire, their dwellings are settled.\nWith simplicity transformed, their customs are joyful.\nIf one pursues desires without restraint,\nhow could they settle in their dwellings?\nHarsh governance and burdens bring only trouble—\nhow could they then delight in their customs?\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Settle their dwellings\"*—settle in thatched huts,\nnot favoring ornate houses.\n*\"Delight in their customs\"*—delight in simple and unadorned ways,\nnot shifting to foreign norms.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n*\"Settle their dwellings\"*—all places are settled,\nstillness within motion.\n*\"Delight in their customs\"*—harmonizing with the world’s light,\nmotion within stillness.\n\n**Fourthly, it illustrates attaining true Dao/Way and harmonizing with its flow,\nexceeding all coming and going.**\nNeighboring lands face one another,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs reach across them—\nyet the people, until death, never visit one another.\n\nThe *Rong*’s Commentary said:\nNeighboring lands face one another—\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nthis speaks of their closeness.\nThat the people, until death, never visit one another,\nis because each has their own sufficiency,\nand nothing more to seek or give.\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\nNeighboring lands face one another,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nthis marks proximity.\nThe people, until death, never visit one another—\nthis is their lack of emotional attachments.\n\n**Rong** said:\nTwo lands as neighbors, visible to the eye,\nroosters crow and dogs bark, heard by the ear—\nfrom beginning to end, in youth and age,\nthey never visit one another.\nEach person is self-sufficient,\neach home holds the Dao.\nThus it is said:\n*\"People forget the Dao as it spreads,*\n*fish forget the rivers and lakes they dwell in.\"*\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\nNeighboring lands face one another—\n*neighbor* means near,\n*lands* refers to the realms of life and death,\nand the Dao’s domain.\nThis says that these two realms lie close within the heart,\nso they are said to face one another.\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nroosters watch for dawn,\ndogs guard through the night—\nthese teachings serve as warnings against the long night of ignorance,\nand calls to the morning of wisdom.\nThus, these teachings are near in expounding the unity of mind,\nso they are said to be heard.\nThat the people, until death, never visit one another—\nwhen one attains true understanding and harmony,\nthis is the Dao.\nThe Dao is neither born from life and death,\nnor does it depart through any path—\nwhen these two realms merge as one,\nthere is no coming or going,\nno distinction between beginnings and ends.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-One of *Sincere Speech Not Beautiful***\n\n*Sincere Speech*—this chapter is the third section,\nits text summarizing earlier themes.\nWithin this chapter, the meaning is divided into three:\n**Firstly, it shows the virtuous/powerful person,\nwhose wisdom transcends all speech and argument.**\nGood medicine tastes bitter,\nsincere speech is not beautiful,\ngreat eloquence seems dull,\nthe learned do not know all.\nThe Sage scatters Dao/Way to teach the common and foolish,\nyet does not hoard it.\nHe laments the long night of ignorance,\nwhile the foolish and dull remain unaware—\nI, like grass, am but one of these common folk,\nstanding at the edge of the boundless sea of desire,\nyet unable to unfurl my ragged robes.\nBefore the mountain of error, who dares lift a foot?\nThe owl that neither cries nor flies—\nwhen it rises, it soars to the heavens.\nThe man who is both foolish and dull—\nhow could he awaken in a hundred years?\n\nThe Sage labors to point out the Great Dao/Way,\nbut distorts the natural transformations of life.\nIn darkness, they do not know—\nwhat more can be said?\n\nI have privately observed the utmost sincerity,\nrefining the self and governing the realm—\nabove, it ascends to the brilliance of the sun,\nsoaring through the clouds like a bird.\nBelow, it cleanses the intestines and washes the heart,\nleading many to follow in its path.\nTo act without effort is the Dao’s honor—\ndwelling in the source of harmony and balance,\nvirtue/power can nourish all things.\nThe child of a skilled craftsman\nmust first learn to make his own leather coat—\nmy disciples embrace the True,\nso why do they not gather?\n\nMy spirit is weary from yellowed scrolls and shallow learning,\nmy Dao is impoverished by clear streams.\nDay and night, I strive in fear,\nnever ceasing in sleep or waking.\nI regret not attaining the likeness of the Sage,\nnor the colors of his teachings.\nMy wasted bones and tattered soul—\nhow could my sighs ever end?\nThose who share my resolve—\ndo not forget this heart’s intent.\n\n*Sincere speech is not beautiful—*\nThe *Rong*’s Commentary said:\n*Sincere speech*—this refers to the Sage’s teachings,\ntruthful and real.\nLaozi wished to clarify his established teachings,\nto transform and guide all beings,\nand truly, these are words of utmost sincerity—\nyet they conflict with common ways,\nso people deem them not beautiful.\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*Sincere speech*—speech that matches reality.\n*Not beautiful*—simple and unadorned.\n\n**Rong** said:\nSincere speech is not beautiful,\nbeautiful speech is not sincere—\nspeech reveals the heart,\nnot a matter of idle fabrication.\nIt seeks true principles,\nnot flashy words.\nThus it is said: *sincere speech is not beautiful,*\n*sweet words lose truth,*\n*light promises lack substance.*\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n*Sincere speech is not beautiful,*\n*beautiful speech is not sincere*—\n*sincere* means real,\n*beautiful* means superficial and gaudy.\nThe virtuous/powerful person, obscured yet in accord with the Dao,\nspeaks teachings that are real without ornamentation.\nSuperficial and gaudy speech—\nmere tales from the common world—\ndeviates from ultimate truth,\nso it is not believed.»\n\n「Thus *Zhuangzi* states: *\"A dog is not considered good merely because it barks well; a person is not deemed virtuous/powerful merely because of eloquent speech.\"* **Beautiful speech lacks sincerity.**\n\n**Yu’s Commentary** said:\n**Beautiful speech** refers to teachings that are sweet and adorned.\nSpeech that is excessive in superficiality and conforms to worldly tastes—\nthough it lacks sincerity and substance—\nit cannot transform others.\nThus, *sincere speech is not beautiful*\nbecause **beautiful speech lacks sincerity.**\n\n**Master Gong of the He River** said:\nThose who speak in **honeyed beauty**—\ntheir words are **nailed and polished** with ornate phrases.\nThose who lack sincerity—\ntheir speech is **decorated with falsehoods**, full of emptiness.\n\nThe **good** do not **argue**—\n**Yu’s Commentary** said:\nThe **good** in understanding teachings\nlie in **cultivation and practice**—\nacting without clinging,\nnever fixating or obstructing,\nthus they do not **argue** for their views.\n\n**Master Gong of the He River** said:\nThe **good** cultivate themselves in the **Dao/Way**,\nwithout embellishing with **literary refinement**.\n\n**Yan** said:\nThose who appear **naive and slow** in speech\nare called **not argumentative**—\nyet their words are **drawn out and true**,\ntheir silence **deep and trustworthy**,\nthus they can **achieve goodness**—\nhow so?\nTheir actions **move the heart of Heaven**,\ntheir stillness **aligns with the will of Earth**—\nthe foundation of the **virtuous/powerful person**,\nthe longest-lasting of all **conducts**.\n\n**Rong** said:\nThe **good** do not **argue**,\nthose who **argue** are not **good**—\n**great argumentation seems naive**,\nwithout **labored words or empty rhetoric**—\nthus the **good** do not **argue**.\nExcessive **partial phrasing**,\noverly **prolific speech**,\n**argumentative words exhaust truth**—\nthus those who **argue** are not **good**.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n**Argumentation** means **distinction and separation**.\nThose who **grasp the ultimate Dao/Way**,\npoint to the **horse of Heaven and Earth** with the **unity of One**,\nthus have nothing to **distinguish or separate**.\nThe **Confucian and Mohist debates** on right and wrong—\nthose who rigidly cling to **self/other duality**—\nare indeed those who have not yet **attained the good Dao/Way**.\n\n**Secondly**, it clarifies that the **virtuous/powerful person of highest virtue** engages in **twofold giving**—\n**of wealth and of virtue**.\n\nThe **good** do not **accumulate**—\n**Yu’s Commentary** said:\n**Accumulation** means **obstruction and stagnation**.\nThe **sage** **penetrates the subtle source of principles**,\n**deeply understands the nature of dharma**,\n**discerns the emptiness of words and teachings**,\nand **realizes the void of verbal instruction**.\nSince their **understood principles are clear**,\ntheir **spoken teachings are also abandoned**,\nthus they **do not accumulate** in those teachings—\nhence it is said: *\"The sage does not accumulate.\"*\n\n**Master Gong of the He River** said:\nThe **sage accumulates virtue, not wealth**,\nusing **wealth to aid the poor**,\nusing **virtue to guide the ignorant**.\n\n**Yan** said:\nThe **sage** **discards argumentation and literary refinement**,\nlike **void and emptiness**,\nholding nothing in **stagnation or accumulation**,\nadapting with all things—\nthus it is said.\n\n**Rong** said:\nThe **sage does not accumulate**—\nwhen they give to others, their own **virtue/power grows**,\nwhen they give to others, their own **virtue/power becomes more abundant**—\n**not accumulating** means **an empty heart**,\nlike the **radiance of the sun and moon**,\nshining upon all **regions and lands**,\nthings **obtain their own illumination**,\nyet their **light becomes ever more brilliant**—\njust as the **sage’s wisdom permeates all things**,\ntheir **dharma-giving is boundless**.\n\nThe **rivers and seas** **nourish and moisten**,\n**benefiting all creatures**—\nthings **gain life through them**,\nyet their **source never runs dry**—\nalso like the **sage’s wealth-giving**, which is **never exhausted**.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n**Accumulation** means **gathering**.\nThe **sage** has **wealth to benefit others**,\nhas **virtue to teach others**,\nthus they do not **accumulate**.\n\nWhen they give to others, their own **virtue/power grows**,\nwhen they give to others, their own **virtue/power becomes more abundant**—\n**Yu’s Commentary** said:\n**Exhaust** means **complete**.\nThough the **sage** does not **stagnate or accumulate** in teachings,\nyet **sentient beings** **awaken their wisdom**,\nmust rely on the **sage’s guidance**.\nThus the **sage** uses **pure and clear rational insight**,\n**fully imparting** to the **common and ignorant** for instruction.\n\nIn the **sage’s nature of wisdom and penetration**,\nthere is **no depletion or waste**,\nhence it is said: *\"The more they give, the more they possess.\"*\nThe **annotation** states:\n**Self-illumination** refers to **inherent clarity**,\n**external illumination** refers to **wisdom gained from teaching**—\nthe **nature of insight**,\nthough not **originating from others**,\nis said to be **self-illumination**.\nThe **benefit from teaching**,\nnot arising **from within themselves**,\nis said to be **external illumination**.\nThus, the **sage’s instruction** of the **common and ignorant**,\n**their wisdom grows ever clearer and more fluent**,\nhence it is said: *\"The more they teach, the more abundant their wisdom.\"*\n\n**Master Gong of the He River** said:\nWhen they give to others, their own **virtue/power grows**,\nwhen they **impart virtue/power and dharma-transformations** to others,\ntheir own **virtue/power and dharma-transformations** grow ever more abundant—\nthus they **possess ever more virtue/power**.»\n\nThe **Dao** thus declares:\n*\"When one gives to others, one’s own abundance grows ever greater—\nwhen one distributes wealth and treasures in alms,\none’s own wealth grows ever more abundant,\nlike the light of sun and moon,\nendless without cessation.\"*\n\n**Master Yan** said:\n*\"The principle of *wuwei* [non-action] is this:\nThe more one gives to others, the brighter one’s own virtue/power becomes,\nthe more one gives to others, the longer one’s own life endures.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary** said:\n*\"When one gives to others, one’s own virtue/power grows ever greater—\n*ji*, meaning ‘exhaustively.’\n*Wei*, meaning ‘to transform and bestow.’\nIt speaks of one’s inherent virtue/power and moral cultivation,\nexhaustively imparted to teach others,\nwithout miserliness or pettiness,\nthus one’s virtue becomes ever more profound and vast—\nthis is *virtue-giving*.\nWhen one gives to others, one’s own abundance grows ever greater—\nall one’s wealth and treasures,\nexhaustively dispersed in alms,\nthe fruit of one’s merit becomes ever broader—\nthis is *wealth-giving*.\"*\n\n**A summary of the highest virtue:**\n*\"Benefiting others while forgetting one’s own deeds.*\nThe **Dao of Heaven** benefits without harming.\"*\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** said:\n*\"The **Dao of Heaven** nourishes and sustains all things—\nthis is benefiting.\nIt takes

The original source: *The Zhengtong Daozang (Orthodox Daoist Canon)* under the *Dongshen (Cavernous Spirits)* section, *Yujue (Jade Precepts)* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Profound Virtue Commentary on the Dao De Jing**\n\nThe Dao is supreme and without form, yet it gives rise to wondrous existence.\nIt governs the boundless Dao, fulfilling the marvelous function of existence—\nwho else but the **Most High Sage-Laozi, the Primordial Emperor**?\n\nEmerging from the **Symbolic Age** (象先), revered as the **Origin of Transformation** (化本),\nHe was the first to fuse the divine essence at the dawn of countless kalpas,\nHis spirit divided to permeate the heavens and earth, nurturing all beings,\nMolding myriad forms, and refining all things.\nThus, the **Three Sovereigns** received their mandate,\nStill adhering to the **Pure Unity** (淳一) of ancient virtue,\nAnd the **Five Emperors** held the **Sacred Maps** (图),\nGradually dispersing the **Uncarved Simplicity** (无为之朴) of the Dao.\n\nThough **Sage-Laozi** descended through the ages,\nAdapting to each era’s needs—\nSometimes as a **national preceptor** (国师),\nSometimes as a **guest of honor** (宾友),\nTeaching scriptures and transmitting the Dao,\nTo instruct the rulers of his time—\nAt the outset of the **Tang and Yu’s abdication** (唐虞禅让),\nWhen the **Way of the world was in decline** (世道交丧),\nHe raised the **Primordial Virtue** (元凯) in the wilderness,\nAnd practiced the **Four Offenses** (四罪) in court,\nThe **Veneration of Worthies** (尚贤) was manifest,\nYet the **Age of Corruption** (瘴恶) also emerged.\nThough inner harmony was upheld,\nOuter strife persisted—\nHuman hearts grew cold,\nThe **Uncarved Simplicity** of the Dao faded like mist.\n\n**Sage-Laozi**, named **Yin Shouzi** (尹寿子),\nDwelling in **Helyang** (河阳),\nPitying the **erring nature of beings** (物性之迁讹),\nFearful that the **true teaching would be abandoned** (真宗之陵替),\nDeemed that the **Great Scriptures of the Three Sovereigns** (三皇大字) were insufficient\nTo guide the **future kings** (后王),\nAnd the **constant Way of the Five Emperors** (五帝常道) could not\nInstruct the **later generations** (末俗).\nThus, he condensed the **profound and mysterious essence** (玄奥义),\nComposing the *Dao De* in **two chapters**.\nHe sought to elucidate the **Dao’s non-action** (无为),\nUsing **virtue** (德) to reveal it—\n**Virtue** has practical application,\nThe **Dao** clarifies its meaning.\n\nHe employed **spoken words** (立言) to express the **ineffable** (无言),\nUsing **principle** (理本) to expound the **mysterious origin** (妙本),\nEstablishing the **foundation for governance and self-cultivation** (理身理国之要),\nAs the **ultimate and most refined teaching** (至精至极之宗),\nAnd bestowed it upon **Shun**.\nNot that he rejected **benevolence, righteousness, sagely wisdom, and intelligence** (仁义圣智),\nBut rather, he tempered **excessive passion, deceit, and sharp cleverness** (浇诈聪明),\nTo guide the **sovereign to rule, ministers to serve, fathers to lead, and children to obey** (君君臣臣父父子子),\nSo they might **embrace the Uncarved and return to simplicity** (见素抱朴),\nMerge with the **Great Harmony** (太和),\nAnd thus naturally attain **loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝).\n\nThe **common scholars** (世儒) do not comprehend,\nAssuming that **Sage-Laozi’s Dao** (老君之道) abandons\n**Benevolence and righteousness** (仁义),\nAnd **overthrows ritual and wisdom** (隳礼智),\nThis is not the **great principle of his teaching** (立教之大方).\n\nMoreover, **supreme benevolence** (至仁) aligns with the **harmonious virtue of heaven and earth** (天地之德),\n**Supreme righteousness** (至义) conforms to the **natural order of heaven and earth** (天地之宜),\n**Supreme joy** (至乐) resonates with the **harmony of heaven and earth** (天地之和),\n**Supreme propriety** (至礼) follows the **rhythms of heaven and earth** (天地之节),\n**Supreme wisdom** (至智) discerns the **distinctions of heaven and earth** (天地之辨),\n**Supreme trust** (至信) attunes to the **timing of heaven and earth** (天地之时).\nIt broadens the **source of Pure Unity** (淳一之源),\nAchieves the **transformation of Great Unity** (大同之化),\nBlends with the **supreme Dao** (混合至道),\nAnd returns to the **Land of Benevolent Longevity** (归仁寿之乡).\nIt is not merely about **affected gestures or hollow rhetoric** (踶跂雍容，噢咻蹩趸),\nBut rather, it is **true benevolence and righteousness** (仁义等).\n\nThus, the **Sages Zhongni and Ya** (仲尼亚圣) all attained it in silence,\nDiscarding **cleverness** (黜聪) and **bodily form** (遗形),\nTranscending the **material realm** (超乎物表),\nAnd becoming **true immortals** (永为真人).\nThis is beyond the understanding of **petty scholars and minor literati** (末学小儒).\n\nFrom the **Xia, Shang, Zhou, and Han dynasties**

and annotated it,\nAnd **numerous scholars** (群彦) have refined and elucidated it,\nThe more one draws from it, the deeper it becomes,\nThe more one tastes of it, the inexhaustible it is.\nWhen applied to **governance**, punishments are set aside,\nAnd **Great Peace** (太平) prevails.\nWhen practiced in **self-cultivation**, the **spirit is preserved** (神全),\nAnd **longevity is attained** (久视).\n\n**Patting the table and brandishing the brush** (拊几挥柄),\nThere have always been those who embody its truth.\n\n**Strong Contemplation (Strong Thinking)**, **Montang’s Qi Muyue** (强思齐，字默越),\nA

year,\nDiscussing the **Great Virtue** (大德) with his master,\nHonored as a **Purple-Clad True Immortal** (赐紫全真),\nResiding in the **Middle Palace of the Ge Immortal** (葛仙中宫),\nAfter reciting

Festival of Longevity** (寿春节),\nHe **received the clear command** (允承明命),\nAnd bestowed the title **Profound Virtue Grandmaster** (玄德大师) upon him.\nFor generations, his **mind dwelled in the Dao** (栖心),\nAll were **granted radiant favor** (洽光宠),\nHis **feathered robes symbolized simplicity** (羽衣象简),\nAnd his **virtue was unparalleled** (其何盛欤).\n\nWhenever he **delved into the profound mysteries** (探讨幽玄),\nAnd **expounded upon common understanding** (发挥流俗),\nHe aimed to **repay the sage’s grace** (报圣明之恩)\nWith the **power of his lectures** (谭讲之力).\n\nIn his **lectures on the *Dao

(不可思议).\nThus, it is titled *The Dao De Jing (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue)*.\n\nThe **Dao** is the **boundless realm of emptiness and flow** (虚通之理境),\n**Virtue** is the **forgetful wisdom

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\n---\n\n**First Distinction: Briefly Establishing Principle and Teaching**\n\nThe Great Dao is a boundless, mysterious principle beyond all forms. Its essence surpasses the grasp of symbols, and its operations arise from the unfathomable. It is not something that can be known by ordinary names, nor is it something that can be fully explored by mere speech. It encompasses all without exclusion, and it penetrates even the finest details—when it manifests, it rides upon the *Palm Boat* (慈舟) of compassion, and when it withdraws, it returns to the *Silent Obscurity* (杜默) of the unspoken. The Yellow Emperor fasted for three months before seeking it, yet Emperor Jing of the Former Han exhausted years without receiving an answer.\n\nIts substance is serene, its name is subtle. Some ascend with the *Dragon Chariot* (龙轩) to wander the *Jade Capital* (玉京), while others harness the *Luan* (鸾) and *Zhī* (骖) to float at the *Golden Gates* (金阙). The Western Sovereign Mother obtained it and sat in the *Minor Broad* (少广), while Dongfang Shuo encountered it and played in the Han Court. Heaven and Earth obtained it and thus were able to bring forth creation, while the myriad beings blew with the ten thousand breaths and gave birth to life. Ah! The profound and boundless Dao—how vast it is!\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao beyond speech.\n\n**Commentary by Yu** (御疏):\n*\"The Dao\"* is a strong designation for the boundless, mysterious origin. *\"By\"* (训由) refers to the path of its operations, *\"Law\"* (训法) refers to its methods, and *\"Constant\"* (训常) refers to its enduring nature. The first character marks its essence, saying that this mysterious origin is the universal path through which all things arise, and thus it may be called *Dao*—hence, *\"The Dao That Can Be Spoken.\"*\n\nIt can be called *Dao* because the scripture says: *\"I do not know its name; I call it Dao.\"* This is to guide students in attaining clarity of nature and cultivating the mind, thus naming it *Dao*.\n\nSeeking its mysterious origin, one finds that its principle is utterly clear and void, its nature is beyond comprehension—neither luminous nor obscure.\n\nAgain, referring to the following passage in the scripture: *\"When seen, it is not seen—called *Yī* (夷); when heard, it is not heard—called *Xī* (希); when grasped, it is not obtained—called *Wēi* (微).\"* The passage before it—*\"When seen, it is not seen\"*—refers to seeking the Dao through color, *\"When heard, it is not heard\"*—through sound, *\"When grasped, it is not obtained\"*—through form. Yet the mysterious Dao is too subtle and profound to be attained by worldly means of sound, color, or form.\n\nReferring to the *\"Scripture of the Nine Heavens Giving Birth to Spirits\"* (九天生神经), it says: *\"The Sage uses the Three Primordials of Mysterious Origin—*Sān Xī* (三熙)—as his substance, speaking of the Three Mysterious Primordials of the Three Heavens—*Sān Miào Xī* (三妙熙).\"* Master Zang Zongdao further uses *\"Three One\"* (三一) as the Sage’s manifested body. The *\"Three One\"* refers to: one *Jīng* (精), two *Shén* (神), and three *Qì* (氣).\n\n*Jīng* is the heart of luminous wisdom and intuitive intelligence. *Shén* is the faculty of boundless, unfathomable operation. *Qì* is the method of colors and forms.\n\nThe scripture says: *\"When seen, it is not seen—called *Yī* (夷), the *Jīng*; when heard, it is not heard—called *Xī* (希), the *Shén*; when grasped, it is not obtained—called *Wēi* (微), the *Qì*.\"* These three methods are unified into one Sage, and the Sage embodies these three aspects without any contradiction—thus, they are merged into one.\n\nBut the *Dao*’s methods and substance are expressed through *\"Three One\"* (三一), which has distinctions between true and manifested. The interpretations of this vary among three schools:\nThe first says: *\"Dissolving the One into Three\"*—meaning the Sage’s manifested body merges the Three into One, which is the Sage’s true substance.\nThe second says: *\"The Three and the One are both manifested; neither the Three nor the One is true. The Three and the One are merely names and numbers.\"*\nThe third asks: *\"Is there a true substance beyond names and numbers, separate from the Three and the One?\"*\n\nIt is said that *\"Three One\"* is not Three nor One—this is the true substance. *\"Three One\"* is neither Three nor One—this is the manifested body. The manifested body that is not *\"Three One\"* is the true manifested body, while the true substance that is *\"Three One\"* is the manifested true substance. The true substance of the manifested body cannot be definitively called true, nor can the manifested body of the true substance be definitively called manifested. Thus, it is neither true nor manifested, yet it is both manifested and true.\n\nThe Sage responds to stimuli and adapts to circumstances, manifesting in myriad forms—sometimes appearing in human guise, sometimes as a celestial being. He reveals himself according to the situation, and his transformations follow the times. His subtle essence is beyond *Yī* (夷) and *Xī* (希), yet it remains difficult to fully comprehend.\n\n**Rong** (荣) says:\n*The Dao* is the principle of boundless voidness, and its symbols cannot be divided by existence or nonexistence. Its true substance cannot be confined by the extremes of high or low. It is said to be mysterious yet beyond thought, profound yet beyond recognition.\n\nThe Sage lays bare this path of the mysterious, opening it as a teaching. He borrows the term *\"Round and Pass Through\"* (圆通) to designate the boundless voidness, calling it the principle that can be named, and thus the *Dao* that can be spoken. *\"I do not know its name\"*—the Sage achieves the Dao through boundless voidness, and its constant nature is attained through serene stillness. This is called the *\"Boundless Great Dao\"* (无极大道), which is the original nature of all beings.\n\nWhat is the *Heavenly Dao*? It is the system of voidness, the root of transformation, the origin of divine illumination, and the source of Heaven and Earth. It is boundless without exclusion, subtle without interiority, vast without end, and profound without measure. Though it is the most hidden and obscure, its great light shines forth. Though it is utterly still without heart, the myriad things have their fixed places. It is mixed and indistinct without form, silent and empty without sound. Yet from it arise all phenomena, and from it are formed the five tones. That which is born has limits, that which is formed has deficiencies. Birth and formation, birth and formation—eternal and unchanging, from ancient times to the present. This is what is called *Dao*.\n\nBefore the *Primordial Qi* (元气) and the boundless voidness, there was serene stillness—what was there? When the most refined essence was stirred, the *True One* (真一) was born.\n\nThe *True One* moves with divine illumination, and thus the *Primordial Qi* transforms naturally. The *Primordial Qi* is the existence within nonexistence, the nonexistence within existence—vast beyond measure, subtle beyond detection. It gradually condenses and solidifies, becoming indistinct and formless, yet from it emerge the origins of all phenomena. Thus, the clear and luminous *Qi* (氣) ascends to form Heaven, while the turbid and obscured *Qi* gathers to form Earth. The harmonious and gentle *Qi* coalesces into human beings and their roles, while the chaotic and rigid *Qi* disperses into various other types.\n\nFrom the single *Qi*’s nurturing, myriad differences are spread and classified. Once the mechanism of transformation is engaged, change is endless without limit. Yet the forms of Heaven, Earth, and all beings arise from the *Primordial Qi* (元氣). That which grants Heaven, Earth, and all beings their spirit is divine illumination. Thus, *Lián* (乾) and *Kūn* (坤) govern Heaven and Earth, while *Jīng* (精) and *Hún* (魂) oversee all beings.\n\n*Qi* undergoes the revolutions of *Yīn* and *Yáng*, while divine illumination is unaffected by cold or heat. Though all things move in confusion beyond count, they perish only to be reborn, end only to begin anew. Yet the body of *Dao* and *Virtue* (德), the divine illumination of the mind, respond to stimuli endlessly without ever being exhausted by the realm of motion and operation.",

      "translated_text": "「The Dao/Way is profound yet encompasses the ten millionfold Heaven without making it vast, penetrates the finest autumn hair without making it small. It precedes the void and formlessness yet is not the beginning, succeeds Heaven and Earth yet is not their end. It ascends to the accumulation of Yang without becoming luminous, descends into the depths of Yin without becoming obscure.\n\nOriginally, there is no *spirit* (神). At the utmost void, spirit emerges. Originally, there is no *Qi* (炁). Through the movement of spirit, Qi transforms. Without foundation or substance, it condenses and coalesces to form shape; shape, originally without *emotion* (情), is diminished by motion and operation.\n\nAs form takes shape and nature moves, the Dao/Way grows ever more distant. Thus, one is lost in birth and death, shifting between Yin and Yang, unable to halt oneself—this is not because the Dao/Way is forgotten while existing, but because it can cause the existent to return to the nonexistent.\n\nHence, the Dao/Way is able to generate existence from nonexistence; how much more can it make the existent conform to the nonexistent! If the existent conforms to the nonexistent, then existence will not perish. Therefore, the Dao/Way gives birth to me, yet passion destroys me. If one forgets passion, then nature is preserved intact. When nature is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, Qi is whole; when Qi is refined, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, the Dao/Way is whole. Thus, when the Dao/Way is complete, spirit reigns supreme; when spirit reigns, Qi becomes responsive; when Qi is responsive, form transcends; when form transcends, nature is fully realized. Those who fully realize nature return and circulate endlessly, merging with the Dao/Way.\n\nIt can make the existent nonexistent, can make the void substantial. I shall align myself with the Creator and let birth and death fail to burden me.\n\nThe Dao/Way can be spoken of as *substance* (體), and named as *function* (用). That which can be spoken of is but the Dao/Way’s manifestation. Though it may be called \"speakable,\" things adapt to their circumstances, giving rise to sound and speech—this is not the Dao/Way of eternal stillness and repose.\n\n○ **Yán** (嚴) says: When *Dao/Virtue* (道德) is manifest, it is not natural. When fame and achievement are displayed, it is not true essence.\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: That which can be spoken of is not the Dao/Way of natural longevity.\n\nThe Dao/Way of constancy should cultivate the nonexistent to nourish the spirit, remain without affairs to settle the people, contain light and conceal brilliance, erase traces and obscure origins—it cannot be named.\n\n○ **Róng** (榮) says: This is not the Dao/Way of humans honoring through rites and propriety, elevating through superficial splendor, losing themselves to gain fame, forgetting themselves to serve profit. They abandon the Dao/Way and follow Virtue (德) thereafter; this teaching now prevails. But having stripped away the trappings of benevolence and righteousness, taking the essence of Dao/Virtue, and returning to the source of purity and simplicity, one reverses their constant passions. Hence, it is called the Dao/Way of constancy.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏): The Dao/Way of constancy cannot be defined by words or reasoned through the mind; it transcends subtlety and eludes the grasp of logic. Thus, knowing beyond words and symbols, one may then conform to the eternal stillness—what can be spoken of and named is not the Dao/Way of constancy.\n\nThat which can be named is not the Dao/Way’s true name.\n○ **Yù Zhù** (御注): Names are the Dao/Way’s designations. I forcefully name it the *Great* (大).\n\nNames do not stand alone; they arise from substance. Words do not exist in isolation; they are established by Virtue (德). The operation of principles and substance flows without obstruction, encompassing all to reach the boundless. Thus, I name the Dao/Way’s *Great* (大) designation to the Dao/Way’s substance, so that things may recognize it—hence, \"that which can be named is named.\"\n\n○ **Yù’s Commentary** (御疏): Names are teachings. Earlier, it was said that what can be spoken of is manifest in principle; now, it is said that what can be named is secondary in teaching. True principle transcends words and symbols, and even teachings surpass verbal articulation.\n\nSince principle is the Dao/Way of constancy yet cannot be spoken of, and teaching is that which can be named yet not the Dao/Way’s true name, one who seeks to clarify principle and teaching finds they are neither one nor different.\n\nYet the supreme Dao/Way is profound and mysterious, beyond measure or limit. It is neither nonexistent nor existent, neither fixed nor constant—though it is not constant, there is still uplift and subsidence. Teaching exists in gradual and sudden stages; thus, constancy is established to break the speakable, hence the statement that the speakable Dao/Way is not the Dao/Way of constancy.\n\nAt the extreme of discourse, there is neither \"can\" nor \"cannot,\" nor is it the Dao/Way of constancy and non-constancy. Hence, the *Jùjīng Jīng* (玉京经) says: *\"Without can or cannot, ponder with the subtle and minute.\"* That which can be named is not the vulgar honor of transient fame, so it is rejected as \"not the Dao/Way of constancy,\" desiring one to abandon the impermanent and return to the eternal constancy.\n\nThere are causes of transcendence and stages of gradual and sudden enlightenment. Opening with the square, one picks up the impermanent; to grasp the eternal constancy, one must go beyond the square. Presenting it to its ultimate, there is no impermanent to be picked up, nor any eternal constancy to be taken—how much more so is the Dao/Way neither the impermanent nor the eternal constancy, nor is it the Dao/Way of the non-eternal constancy nor the Dao/Way of the eternal constancy!\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: It is not the name of the Dao/Way that is naturally ever-present.\n\nThe name of constancy should be like an infant before speech, a chicken egg before division, a bright pearl within the shell, or a fine jade hidden in stone—internally luminous, externally dull. The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Dao/Way of constancy; that which can be named is not the Dao/Way’s true name.\n\nThe second passage clarifies the original traces.\nThe nonexistent is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The existent is the mother of all things.\n\n○ **Yù Zhù** (御注): The nonexistent is the mysterious origin. The mysterious origin reveals itself in Qi, temporarily manifesting as Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth derive their beginning, so the nonexistent is called the beginning. The existent is the response to application.\n\n○ **Róng** (榮) says: The Dao/Way is profound, its Virtue (德) subtle. Principle transcends existence and nonexistence. Since existence and nonexistence are transcended, names are discarded. Yet the function of void and emptiness is limitless—how can it not be nonexistent while being nonexistent? Thus, the nonexistent is the beginning of the two principles (兩儀). The existent, though not truly existent, is the mother of all things.\n\nHence, the Dao/Way generates and accumulates Virtue (德)—this is what is meant.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏): This nonexistent is the origin of all things. The Dao/Way originally has no name, thus it is known that it cannot be spoken of or explained. The existent is the mother of all things, as it is described. The Dao/Way of *Double Mystery* (重玄) originally has no name; descending from the origin to traces, names and designations arise. Thus, the sage establishes the existent from the nonexistent, entrusting the existent to elucidate the nonexistent, desiring to nurture all beings and lead them back to their origin. With compassion and mercy, they cultivate and nourish, akin to a mother’s care.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: The nonexistent is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The nonexistent is the Dao/Way, for the Dao/Way has no form and thus cannot be named.»",

If one does not still their emotions, but instead pursues desires and moves with them, their nature is lost to desire, and they become bewildered at the source of the Dao/Way. If they then seek to observe the wondrous origin, they will only perceive its marginal subtleties.\n\n○ **御疏** (Imperial Commentary): To habitually be without desire means to uphold the law-nature of purity and stillness, detached from speech and thought, with no lingering attachments—thus, one perceives the Dao/Way’s most subtle and wondrous essence. To habitually indulge desire is to rise from the origin and act, establishing teachings through speech, adapting to things and achieving harmony, transforming the world—thus, one perceives the convergence of all beings.\n\n○ **缴** (return) is to **归** (return).\n\n○ **严** (Yan) says: To be without desire is to gaze beyond all gazing.

To walk without desire is to smooth the heart and traverse the silent path, to purify the will and ford the mysterious depths—when desires are insufficient to disturb the spirit, and distractions cannot slip the mind, the luminous platform is serene and cold, the mysterious mirror deep and clear. Then one can perceive the marginal subtleties and grasp the wondrous essence; this is the way of non-desire.\n\nThe way of desire, if one cannot yet abandon recognition, when emotions are bound within form and roam through the body, is not merely agitation over sounds and colors, but to adhere to the affairs of the existent—how does one recognize the principles of the nonexistent?

      "translated_text": "「Though one cannot act without *for* [事], nor remain tranquil and unadorned, yet observing the Dao/Way’s subtlety and upholding its truth—when false stirrings arise in hunger and seeking, when emotions run wild and cling to stagnation—this is but the sight of the world’s *for* [有], failing to grasp that *for* [有] is empty. Thus, one cannot perceive the Dao/Way’s profound principles, seeing only the fate of life and death. This earlier distinction of nameless and named *virtue/power* [名] now reveals the triumph of desireless over desireful conduct.\n\nThe Fourth Assembly expounds the *Dao/Way’s* ultimate subtlety. These two—though sharing the same origin, differing only in name—\n○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: As with the two above, both arise from the Dao/Way, hence they are called the same.\nFrom movement comes application; names are established according to use, hence their difference.\n\n○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: Both derive from the same subtle source, thus they are identical in origin. Names differ as they are applied to distinct uses.\n\n○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: Desireful and desireless conduct both originate from the human heart. Desireless conduct endures, while desireful conduct consumes the self—thus their difference.\n\n○ **荣** (Róng) says: In close terms, these two—desireful and desireless—refer to humanity. All share the five constant essences [五常], all possess the same *innate mind* [方寸之心], hence their sameness.\nTo reject clarity and remain tranquil, penetrating the Dao/Way’s source, is to attain the *subtle* [妙]. To be ensnared by perceptions before understanding, lost in mundane affairs, is to fall into *entanglement* [缴]. This is their divergence in name.\n\nIn broader terms, the Sage seeks to fulfill the Dao/Way’s clear and empty principles, thus taking *virtue/power* [道德] as their core. Hence, this chapter emphasizes their duality—*virtue/power* [道德] and *virtue/power* [道德]—while the Dao/Way’s essence remains unified. Thus, they are called the same.\nThe *Dao/Way’s* essence, arising from stillness, is hence termed *out* [出].

It states that those with desireful or desireless conduct all receive *qi* [气] from the heavens.\n\n○ **荣** (Róng) says: The Dao/Way of emptiness and stillness, the *virtue/power* [德] of profound subtlety—its elusive nature is not easily grasped, its silent mystery not easily spoken of. No name can suffice.\nThe term *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is borrowed to signify the same, for the Dao/Way’s subtlety is ineffable. Only the Dao/Way and *virtue/power* [德] can convey *ultimate subtlety* [玄], hence it is said: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] is profound and distant, the Dao/Way is supremely subtle and still.\n\n○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: When spoken of as *out* [出], their names differ—this is the progression from origin to application.\nWhen spoken of as the same, it signifies profound subtlety—this is the return to the source, transcending all dualities.\nTo return to the source is to attain profound subtlety, hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\n\n○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] means profound and distant, also the name for non-stagnation. The twofold heart of desireful and desireless conduct, both modes of observing *entanglement* [缴] and *subtle* [妙], originate from the same Dao/Way, differing only in name.\nThe Dao/Way, though named differently, is profound and distant. Its principle returns to non-stagnation.\nNeither stagnating in existence nor in non-existence, both are transcended—hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\n*Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄], is the gateway to all subtleties.\n\n○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: Since the mind does not generate, it aligns with the profound subtlety. Yet fearing that *ultimate subtlety* [玄] might be taken as stagnation, it further dismisses the notion of attachment, demonstrating that desireless conduct transcends desire. Those who attain this understand all *dharma* [法], hence it is called the gateway to all subtleties.\n\n○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is the heavens within the heavens. Those who receive *qi* [气] with varying depths—if they attain the harmony of *central equilibrium* [中和] and pure nourishment, they become sages and worthy. If they fall into disorder and impurity, they become nobles of licentiousness.\nThe gateway to all subtleties is to know that the heavens contain another heavens, that *qi* [气] has varying depths, and to eliminate emotions and desires while guarding *central equilibrium* [中和]. This is the gateway to understanding the Dao/Way’s essence.\n\n○ **荣** (Róng) says: *Virtue/power* [道德] is elusive and profound, its principles surpassing all speech and forms. Its true essence is tranquil and vast, its affairs transcending existence and non-existence. Borrowing terms beyond speech and forms, beyond existence and non-existence, to illuminate the Dao/Way’s hidden path—hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\nYet one might fear that those lost in duality cling to the pillar, or those who abandon principle guard the stump. Thus, to fix *ultimate subtlety* [玄] as the true Dao/Way is incorrect. Therefore, it is further stated: it is not the fixed name of existence or non-existence.\nUsing *ultimate subtlety* [玄] to dismiss existence and non-existence, once existence and non-existence are dismissed, *ultimate subtlety* [玄] itself is lost—hence it is said: *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\n*Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is beyond threefold reversal and fourfold phrasing. It is boundless and open, unimpeded by emptiness, encompassing all phenomena’s pivotal essence and unlocking the hundredfold gates of wisdom. Those who reach this state—all subtleties’ gateway.\n\n○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: The *Scripture of Western Ascension* [西升经] states: \"Same origin, differing names, each generates its own *emotional causes* [意因].\"\nNow, without generating *emotional causes* [意因], it is identical with profound subtlety.\nDesireless conduct in desirelessness—desirelessness is the *emotional cause* [意因] for desire. Hence, one seeks desirelessness.\nTo seek desirelessness while still clinging to desire is not yet free. Now, having no desire, there is no gateway either.\n○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄]—for those with desire, desirelessness is the dismissal of attachment again and again, until all is forgotten.\nTrue observation, such as this, is the attainment of all subtleties.\nThough subtleties are many, they all originate from this—yet one stagnates in existence, while the desireless person stagnates in non-existence. Hence, it speaks of *ultimate subtlety* [玄] to dismiss both attachments.\nAgain, fearing that scholars might stagnate in this *ultimate subtlety* [玄], it further speaks of *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄], to further alleviate the lingering affliction.\nNot only does it not stagnate, but it also transcends non-stagnation—this is the dismissal of attachment again and again, hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄].\nThe gateway to all subtleties—*subtlety* [妙] refers to the essential subtlety, *gateway* [门] is the *dharma gate* [法门].\nEarlier, the profound subtlety of central unity dismissed the duality of both categories. Once the dual afflictions are removed, the profound subtlety’s medicine is further dismissed. Thus, medicine and affliction vanish simultaneously—this is the ultimate subtlety, the pinnacle of profound principles, exhausting all reason and nature. It is not merely the door to sages, but also the gateway to all subtleties.»",
      "overlap_context": "** (Hé Shànggōng) says: To habitually be without desire and observe its subtlety, for subtlety is the essence. When a person habitually remains without desire, they can observe the Dao/Way’s essence. The essence is oneness—from this oneness, names and transformations are emitted, and the Dao/Way is praised. This is the Master who discerns right and wrong.\n\n○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): **缴** (return) is to **归** (return). Desire is the entanglement of emotions. **所** (that which) is the realm.»",

      "translated_text": "「**The World All Knows Beauty as Beauty, the Second Chapter**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the earlier chapter elucidates the two views of existence and non-existence [有无二观], with their coarse and subtle distinctions. Therefore, this chapter reveals the efficacy of the *non-action* [无为] and the perils of *action* [有为], dividing its meaning into two parts: the first clarifies the common attachments and stagnations that give rise to confusion and delusion, while the second demonstrates the *sage’s wisdom* [圣智] in its emptiness and clarity, as it forgets merit and aids beings without self-interest.\n\n**First: Clarifying the Common Attachments and Stagnations That Give Rise to Delusion**\nWithin this chapter, two further distinctions are made: the first two sentences broadly refute the illusory nature of beauty and goodness [美善], while the remaining six sentences, in three pairs, illuminate the emptiness of all phenomena [诸法无实].\n\n**First: Broadly Refuting the Illusory Nature of Beauty and Goodness**\nThe ordinary folk of the world are ensnared by sounds and colors, bound by *action* [有为], never finding true repose. They chase fame and profit like monkeys leaping from branch to branch, indulge in love and desire like moths drawn to flame. They confuse evil for good, regard ease as difficulty, and dwell in the nameless void of ignorance, clinging stubbornly to their fragile, perilous selves. How could they comprehend the *subtle Dao* [妙道] in its emptiness and fluidity, the true words and rational sequence, when its brilliance and obscurity defy explanation, and its acceptance is blind? The Seven Sages [七圣] lost their way at Xiangcheng, and Xizi spoke in vain at Hengshan. Sounds and colors fade into nothingness, and the distinction between self and other dissolves into emptiness. Only by abandoning the flawed body of *existence with defilements* [有漏] can one align with the *non-action Dao* [无为之道].\n\nThe world all knows beauty as beauty—then evil arises.\nThe world all knows goodness as goodness—then what is not good arises.\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\nBeauty and goodness arise from desire [欲心]. When desire dictates what is beautiful or good, even what is evil becomes beautiful or good—hence, \"the world all knows.\" One takes what pleases their own desires as beautiful or good, but beauty and goodness have no inherent master; they are merely deluded emotions, born from clinging to distinctions of existence and non-existence, ease and difficulty, the wondrous and the foul—each falsely usurping the other.\n\nThe Great Sage discerns this emptiness and delusion, thus declaring, \"Then evil arises.\"\n\n**Commentary from the *Riverbank Master* [河上公]:**\nWhen the world all knows beauty as beauty, it is merely self-praise, making it appear radiant.\n\n\"Then evil arises\"—this means peril and ruin are imminent.\nWhen the world all knows goodness as goodness, it implies a demand for merit and reward—then what is not good arises, and people vie for it.\n\n**Commentary by Yan [严]:**\nHuman cleverness can be cut off but not dispersed; human desires can be resisted but not reversed. Adorning one’s appearance harms one’s nature, and gratifying desire shortens one’s life. The world’s so-called \"beauty and goodness\" are not the utmost beauty or goodness.\n\nTrue beauty is not what the world can see, and true goodness is not what the world can know.\n\n**Commentary by Rong [荣]:**\nBeauty is pleasure.\nAll people, by their inherent nature, cannot find joy in the Dao but instead take glory as pleasure. Pleasure cannot be boundless—when pushed to extremes, sorrow follows. Desire cannot be indulged recklessly—when unrestrained, it leads to ruin. Hence, people take sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes as supreme pleasure, unaware of how these very things bring great calamity.\n\nWhen simplicity [朴] becomes a curse, when simplicity is lost, sorrow arises. When the root is extinguished, nature is harmed, and the body falls into ruin.\n\nThe world all knows goodness as goodness—then what is not good arises.\n\nFrom the highest to the lowest, the noble and the vulgar, none can truly empty their minds and selves, yet all indulge their desires and emotions. Though their affections differ, each follows their nature and shares the same attachments.\n\nThose who love fame regard fame as goodness; those who love profit regard profit as goodness. If one pursues profit without the proper means, or clings to fame to the point of self-destruction, then goodness becomes ruinous.\n\nThough conforming to desire may seem good, it leads to self-destruction—this is true evil. Hence, Boyi perished for fame atop Mount Shouyang, while Zhi the Thief died for profit beneath the Eastern Ling. This is what is not good.\n\n*The world* [世问] is a general term for the worldly realm.\n*The world* [世问] refers to all beings between the heavens and the earth, those who are immersed in dusty illusions and falsely cling to beauty and evil. Those who oppose their true nature stir hatred—this is called evil. Those who follow their deluded intentions breed attachment—this is called beauty.\n\nNot knowing that all phenomena are both *existent* [有] and *empty* [空], when beauty and evil are seen as empty, why cling to hatred or love?\n\nThus, the *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Maoqiang and Xishi are what people call beautiful, but fish see them as deep and dark, and birds see them as high and lofty.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The beautiful praise themselves as beautiful—I do not know their beauty.*\n*The evil condemn themselves as evil—I do not know their evil.\"*\n\nBy this, it is proven that beauty and evil are mere illusions. Hence, one who clings to worldly beauty as true beauty knows only evil, and one who clings to worldly goodness as true goodness knows only what is not good.\n\nThe vulgar masses, lost in delusion, do not merely indulge in sounds and colors but also fixate on reputation, seeking fame even at the cost of their lives, harming others for personal gain. They do not realize that goodness is an empty, delusive notion—hence, the following passage asks: *Which is closer to one’s self, fame or the body?*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To do good without seeking fame is near,\"*\nand also:\n*\"What they prize and cherish are none other than fame and goodness.\"*\n\nThus, it is clear that clinging to fame and goodness contradicts true principle. Only by forgetting goodness and evil and attaining the *central equilibrium* [居中] can one truly embody the *non-action Dao* [无为之致].\n\n**Second: Illuminating the Emptiness of All Phenomena**\nThus, *existence* [有] and *non-existence* [无] give rise to each other.\n\n**Commentary from the *Riverbank Master*:**\nTo perceive *existence* [有] as *non-existence* [无]—this is the nature of emptiness.\n\n**Commentary by Rong:**\nAll things arise from *existence* [有], and *existence* [有] arises from *non-existence* [无]. From *non-existence* [无] comes *existence* [有], and from *existence* [有] returns *non-existence* [无]—hence, they give rise to each other.\n\nDifficulty and ease [难易] complete one another...»",

Without tone, there is no way to know voice; without voice, there is no way to know tone.\"*\n\nThe *Master of Strictness* responds: *\"The high sings, the low responds with harmony.\"*\n\n**Daoist Classic of the Mysterious Virtue: *Zhenjing* (True Scripture) – Imperial Commentary and Exegesis by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang, with annotations by Master Riverbank, Master Yan, Master Li, and Master Cheng**\n\n**Chapter 5: \"Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent\"**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter expounded the Dao of emptiness and mystery, transcending all phenomena before their manifestation. Thus, this chapter reveals the principle of forgetting merit, where the Sage aligns with the two primal forces (*Yin* and *Yang*) in virtue.\n\nWithin this chapter, three themes unfold:\n1. The Sage and Heaven and Earth, acting without attachment to merit,\n2. The analogy of the uncarved block (*su* – raw) and the empty vessel (*qiao* – hollow), illustrating the subtle efficacy of the Dao,\n3. The critique of excessive knowledge and learning, which pale in comparison to attaining the Dao’s truth.\n\n**1. The Sage and Heaven and Earth, acting without attachment to merit.**\nFrom the single breath of *Qi*, the two primal forces are shaped—*Yin* and *Yang* divide and settle: Heaven, round and clear, covers above; Earth, square and turbid, condenses below. Both owe their existence to the great Dao, sharing the same observation of *Yin-Yang Qi*. Why does *Nuwa* speak of refining stone to prop up Heaven? Why does *Kuafu* die at the banks of the River? Why does *Zhuiyi* walk endlessly without reaching the end? Why does *Qinmi* gaze without limit? Heaven and Earth show no favor, treating all things as mere *chúdǒu*—sacrificial straw-dogs. The vast *Tianhan* (Heavenly River) flows without regard for distance; the distant *Héyuán* (River’s Source) vanishes without measure. *Zhang Qian* could not fathom its length—compared to the uncarved block, only material form is seen; likened to the empty vessel, no sound of exhaustion is heard. The Dao of Heaven turns in its cycles—how could it be called benevolent?\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*.\nThe Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as *chúdǒu*.\n**Imperial Commentary:** *\"Not benevolent\"* means they do not act with benevolent favor.\n*\"Chúdǒu\"* refers to straw bound into the shape of a dog, used in sacrifices. Dogs, by nature, guard and bark—thus, they receive the protection of a roof. But the *chúdǒu* is merely a dog in form, lacking the true function of barking and guarding. Hence, it is said to have no genuine connection to benevolence or love. It is as if Heaven and Earth regard humanity no differently than they regard straw-dogs—expecting no gratitude in return.\n\n**Reflection:** If supreme benevolence has no favorites, who then embodies universal love? Love that is not supreme is merely partial. If one does not love only their own kin, then all under Heaven are kin. If one does not consider only their own children, then all under Heaven are children. Thus, supreme benevolence’s lack of partiality is in truth the most inclusive love.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *\"Benevolence\"* is the name given to universal love. *Chú* means straw; the straw-dog is formed by binding straw into a dog’s shape for sacrificial use. *Zhuangzi* states: *\"Before the straw-dog is offered in sacrifice, it is adorned with fine embroidery. Once the ritual is complete, it is discarded, and even its ashes are used for fuel.\"* Heaven and Earth, in their supreme benevolence, give rise to all beings, just as humans bind straw into a dog’s form—expecting no barking or guarding in return. They do not regard the act of creation as benevolent favor, hence they are called *\"not benevolent.\"*\n\nThe Sage, in pardoning the world, views the people likewise—no expectations, no demands.\n\n**Annotation by Master Yan:** *\"Heaven, by its height, is clear and bright; Earth, by its depth, is moist and tranquil. *Yin* and *Yang* interact, and harmonious *Qi* flows. Thus, all things arise naturally without contrivance—Heaven and Earth do not labor with their hearts to show benevolence. The Sage upholds the Dao and harmonizes with it, remaining serene and unchanging, adapting to all transformations with divine insight. Aligned with the Dao’s ways, the world responds, and all things transform spontaneously. Does this not free one from anxious deliberation, revealing the true nature of benevolence?\"*\n\n**Annotation by Master Li:** *\"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*. Long and short, right and wrong—all are natural distinctions. Benevolence is love. Where there is love, there is also hatred. Heaven and Earth act without intent, transcending love and hatred. Because they are without love, they are called ‘not benevolent.’ The straw-dog is merely straw shaped like a dog; in ancient rituals, it was used in offerings, then discarded. It is said that the straw-dog is not loved when used, nor hated when discarded—an analogy for Heaven and Earth’s warmth like spring *Qi* naturally flowing, where creation is not seen as benevolence, nor destruction as righteousness. The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as *chúdǒu*. The Sage acts without intent, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s virtue. The meaning of ‘not benevolent’ and ‘straw-dog’ is now clear.*\n\nThough their grace extends to grass and trees, their blessings reach even the *zhūyú* (fish and turtles), their winds and teachings precede humanity—yet still, they are called ‘people’ in this context.\"\n\n**Exegesis by Master Cheng:** *\"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*. Benevolence is favor; the straw-dog is a hollow imitation of a dog. *Zhuangzi* says: ‘The discarded straw-dog is still round and domed above, square and firm below—just as *Yin* and *Yang* cover and load all beings, nurturing them with care. Yet, it is said they have no benevolence because they regard all things as one straw-dog.’ What is the straw-dog? It is merely a dog in name, not in reality. How much more so for all phenomena, which are equally hollow and empty—none deserving the expectation of gratitude or return!\"*",
      "overlap_context": "opple and seize—where there is height, there is lowliness; without lowliness, there is no height. For instance, a foot measured against an inch is high, while the same foot measured against a yard is low. What was once high becomes now low—thus, it is known that height and lowliness have no fixed reality, only mutual incline and seizure, hence all are empty.\"*\n\nSound and voice harmonize together. The *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *\"This illustrates the emptiness of harmony and unity.\"*",

The primal *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing) *qì* endures, the Valley Spirit preserves life, subtly and enduringly.\n\nBy adhering to the singular principle, one achieves eternal solidity;\nBy consuming the five *yá* (tooth-like, refined essences), one attains the True.\n\nWhite hair returns to youthful vitality,\nTortoise-like years extend to great longevity.\nSeeing the morning fungus and not sighing,\nEmbracing the great *chūn* (thousand-year) tree with certainty.\n\nTo the left, I pat the shoulder of Hongya,\nTo the right, I draw upon the spirit of Gaoqiu.\nHow does one reach this?\nThe subtle principles of nurturing and guarding are profound indeed.\n\n**The Unending Valley Spirit**\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*Gǔ* (Valley) is empty yet responsive.\n*Shén* (Spirit) is wondrous and unfathomable.\n*Sǐ* (Death) signifies rest.\nThe Valley’s response to sound is unknown—\nYet when there is sensation, it responds,\nAnd its response is as divine,\nAs divine as its response, yet it never rests.\nTo illuminate the supreme Dao—\nEmpty yet generating all things,\nIts wondrous operation defies naming,\nThus the Valley Spirit is used as an analogy.\n\n**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**\nThe Unending Valley Spirit refers to the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\nThe Valley Spirit clarifies how the Valley responds to sound,\nLike the Dao responding to things—\nWhen there is sensation, it responds,\nAnd its response is divine.\n*Shén* (Spirit) is the name for the unfathomable.\n*Death* signifies rest,\nYet the unfathomable response never rests,\nHence, the Valley Spirit does not die.\n\n*Xiān* (Profound) means deep.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) means mother.\nThe Valley Spirit’s response is profoundly mysterious and beyond naming,\nNurturing all things to flourish,\nThus it is called the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n\nThe gate of the *xiānmǎn* is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe operation of the *xiānmǎn* is such that\nWhen there is sensation, it responds,\nAnd its response arises from things,\nThus it is called a gate.\n\nA gate signifies entry and exit.\nHeaven and Earth, the greatest of formed things,\nWithout the operation of the *xiānmǎn*,\nWould fragment and disperse.\nThus, they rely on the singular principle as their root,\nHence, it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Gēn* (Root) means origin.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\n*Gǔ* (Valley) means nourishment.\nIf one can nourish the spirit, they will not die.\nThe spirit refers to the spirits of the five *zàng* (viscera).\nThe liver houses the *hún* (ethereal soul),\nThe lungs house the *pò* (corporeal soul),\nThe heart houses the spirit,\nThe kidneys house the *jīng* (essence),\nThe spleen houses the *zhì* (willpower).\nWhen the five *zàng* are all injured,\nThe five spirits depart.\n\n**Master Yán said:**\nThe supreme harmony of wondrous *qi*,\nLike a wondrous thing as divine,\nEmptiness as its dwelling,\nSilence as its constant state,\nEntering and exiting without openings,\nComing and going without hindrance,\nIn motion, nothing fails,\nIn stillness, nothing is incomplete,\nTransforming yet not transforming,\nGenerating yet not generating.\n\n**Master Róng said:**\nThe Unending Valley Spirit is the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\nMaster Hé Shànggōng spoke of it as nourishing the spirit,\nWhich is the method of *sǐcún* (thoughtful preservation).\nMaster Fǔsì spoke of the emptiness within the Valley,\nThis is metaphorical language.\nThough the insights of the true and virtuous are lofty,\nThey are all explanations of particulars.\n\nNow, I shall speak of this in terms of principle.\n*Gǔ* (Valley) is emptiness,\n*Xiān* (Profound) is the Dao,\n*Mǎn* (Taem) is stillness.\n\nIf one has form and spirit,\nThen there is life and death.\nIf there is life and death,\nOne cannot speak of the Dao,\nFor it flows and shifts without constancy—\nHow could it be called still?\n\nIf one can empty form and spirit,\nAbandoning the self and objects,\nExiting without root,\nGathering *qi* yet not claiming life,\nEntering without openings,\nDispersing *qi* yet not claiming death—\nNot dying, not living,\nThis is the meaning of the Valley Spirit.\n\nLife and death are ever-present,\nFloating and unstable, lacking substance.\nDeep, feminine, and still,\nSerene and unmoving—\nThis is the meaning of *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*Gǔ* (Valley) is emptiness.\n*Shén* (Spirit) is luminous intelligence.\nMaster Hé Shànggōng said:\n*Gǔ* (Valley) means nourishment,\nSpeaking of how the common people wander through life and death\nDue to their attachment to desires.\nIf one can guide and gather the spirit,\nLike bathing in emptiness,\nWith a pure and unobstructed container,\nThen one will no longer experience life and death.\n\nThis is called the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n\n**Master Guo’s Annotation:**\n*Xiān* (Profound) is the name for the unobstructed.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) signifies feminine gentleness.\nTo clarify nourishing the spirit like the Valley,\nSo that it does not die,\nThere is nothing better than stillness, retreat, and feminine gentleness—\nA pure and unobstructed container of singularity.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\nThe Dao of not dying lies in the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).\n*Xiān* (Profound) is Heaven,\nIn humans, it is the nose.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) is Earth,\nIn humans, it is the [mouth].\nHeaven nourishes humans with the five *qì*,\nEntering through the nose and stored in the heart.\nThe five *qì*, pure and subtle,\nBecome the spirit, clarity, intelligence, sound, and harmony.\nTheir ghost is called *hún* (ethereal soul),\nThe *hún* is masculine,\nControlling entry and exit through the nose,\nCommunicating with Heaven,\nThus the nose is called *xiān* (profound).\n\n*Mǎn* (Taem) is Earth,\nEarth nourishes humans with the five flavors,\nEntering through the mouth and processed by the stomach.\nThe five flavors, coarse and impure,\nBecome the form, flesh, bones, and the six emotions.\nTheir ghost is called *pò* (corporeal soul),\nThe *pò* is feminine,\nGenerated through entry and exit by the mouth,\nCommunicating with Earth,\nThus it is called *mǎn* (taem).\n\n**Master Yán said:**\nThe *mǎn* (taem), though feminine and yielding, can generate the profound,\nLike the distant and unseen yet nurturing as a mother,\nIts form unseen.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThis continues the previous passage.\n*Xiān* (Profound) is the name for the unobstructed.\n*Mǎn* (Taem) signifies feminine gentleness.\nTo clarify

      "translated_text": "If one speaks of the spirit as empty, this is the view of annihilation;\nIf one speaks of the spirit as having substance, this is the view of permanence.\nEarlier, the emptiness of the spirit was spoken of,\nAnd thus immortality was attained—\nYet still, fearing that students might stagnate in this emptiness,\nNow it is said: *If* it exists,\nTo cure the view of annihilation.\n\nAgain, fearing that students might drown in the having,\nThe word *as if* is appended to cure the view of permanence—\nThus, employing this practice of neither non-existence nor existence,\nThis mind of neither permanence nor interruption,\nAs the essential technique for cultivating the Dao,\nIt is not laborious yet truly authentic.\n\nThus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"To move is to bear the burden of kalpas,\nReflecting on how wearying and toilsome it is—\nMy learning is in having no learning,\nOnly then can one illuminate the natural.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Heaven’s Duration and Earth’s Longevity**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nFor the prior chapter elucidates the Dao of the Profound Taem,\nCapable of establishing the two principles—\nThus, this chapter follows, relying on the two principles,\nAs the method for cultivation.\n\nWithin this chapter, there are three layers:\nFirst, the two principles are directly presented through hypothetical question and answer;\nSecond, the capacity of the Sage’s wisdom and cultivation is briefly revealed;\nThird, a concluding praise of the Sage’s singular eminence is given.\n\n**First: The Two Principles Presented Through Hypothetical Question and Answer**\nThe Three Powers initiate the primordial breath,\nThe Two Principles firmly established—\nThe sun and moon hang their luminous forms,\nStars illuminate the darkness—\nThe Azure Dragon ascends to govern Heaven,\nThe White Steed carries the Earth in motion,\nThunder and lightning display their might,\nQi spreads through yin and yang—\nBorn from the Dao itself,\nThe mother of all things,\nVile yet precious,\nThe Eight Gates where the clay pot flies,\nWisdom that is not foolish,\nThe Master of Shu’s clarity over ten thousand acres.\n\nUnrevealed yet undiminished,\nThe Great Dao thus lends its form—\nEnduring peace, enduring stability,\nWondrous transformations are forged within—\nBeneath, it steadies mountains and valleys;\nAbove, it floats as mist and cloud—\nA pile of eggs unbroken,\nFor its essence is the power of the Great Dao.\n\n**Heaven’s Duration and Earth’s Longevity.**\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nMarking Heaven and Earth’s longevity,\nTo show that without selfishness or contrivance,\nOne can endure and persist—\nThe meaning is fulfilled in the Sage,\nWho transcends the body yet preserves it,\nAchieving private through the abandonment of private.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis marks the chapter’s title—\nHeaven is marked by its qi and phenomena, hence *long*;\nEarth is marked by its form and substance, hence *durable*.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\nSpeaking of Heaven and Earth’s longevity and vitality,\nIt is an analogy for instructing people.\n\n**Master Róng said:**\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nLies in their not self-generating—\nThus they can attain longevity.\n\nThe sun and moon wax and wane,\nTheir cycles of decline and return cannot be halted—\nYin and yang contract and expand,\nThe seasons of cold and heat pass swiftly—\nYet all things are insufficient within them,\nThus the Two Principles alone endure—\nHence, the virtues of Heaven and Earth are marked,\nAnd the reason for their longevity is asked—\nNone but the principle of *wu-xin* (non-selfishness),\nNot self-cultivating in their generation.\n\nIf people can model themselves after Heaven and Earth,\nWith *wu-xin* and not self-cultivating to nourish deeply,\nThen the bones of the immortal will surpass gold and stone,\nAnd eternal blessings will endure—\nBinding the square and round eternally and firmly.\nBut if one cannot abandon right and wrong to align with the Dao,\nOr abandon emotions and desires to congeal the True One—\nThen deaf and blind to sounds and colors,\nNostrils and mouths overwhelmed by fragrance and flavor,\nThe body wearies externally,\nThe mind exhausts internally—\nThen a hundred years are like morning dew,\nA thousand gold like evening cockscomb—\nThus it is said: *People’s disregard for death*\nArises from their not deeply valuing life—\nThus they lightly regard death.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThough the Two Principles are vast,\nThey still have the limit of kalpa’s exhaustion—\nYet within their forms, they slightly extend longevity,\nThus Heaven and Earth are cited to analogize the Sage.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nLies in their not self-generating—\nThus they can attain longevity.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nHeaven and Earth generate all things,\nTheir virtues and applications are vast,\nYet they endure and persist\nBecause they draw from the Dao’s endowment,\nNot arrogating their own creative function—\nThus it is so.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nEarlier, the chapter’s title was marked—\nNow, a hypothetical question is posed.\n\nThe question states:\n*\"Why can Heaven and Earth endure and persist?\"*\nBecause they cover and nourish all things,\nAnd all draw sustenance from the wondrous origin—\nThey do not arrogate their own creative functions,\nThus they can endure and generate all things.\n\nAnother explanation:\n*\"Not self-generating\"* means\nHeaven and Earth merely generate and nourish all things,\nNot enriching their own lives—\nThus they can endure and persist.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nLies in their not self-generating.\nHeaven and Earth alone endure and persist\nBecause they are tranquil and selfless in their actions,\nNot like humans, who anxiously seek their own benefits,\nPlundering others to enrich themselves—\nThus they can endure and persist,\nFor they do not seek life—\nThus they can attain eternal longevity without end.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nHeaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist\nIs posed as a hypothetical question to elucidate its meaning—\n*\"Not self-generating\"* is the answer to the prior question,\nExplaining its origin.\n\nIt states:\nHeaven and Earth merely bestow life upon all things,\nNot cultivating their own existence—\nThus they can endure and persist.\n\n**Node Analysis:**\n*Heaven’s Duration* refers to the *níwán* (cranial center),\n*Earth’s Longevity* refers to the *dāntián* (lower elixir field)—\nFrom the *níwán* descending to the *xiàngguān* (palace of light),\nThe *dāntián* ascending in a single flow—\nAbove and below, the primordial *qi* circulates and permeates,\nAll joints are moistened,\nHarmonious *qi* spontaneously arises,\nThe Great Dao is complete—\nThus it is called *long life*.\n\n**Second: Briefly Revealing the Sage’s Wisdom and Cultivation**\nThus, the Sage places his body last yet it is first,\nSets his body aside yet it is

says:\nHeaven and Earth endure long, the Sage is first and preserved—\nIs it not because they have no selfish intent,\nYet achieve this enduring, first-preserved private essence?\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says:\nIs it not because of their *wu si*?\nThe Sage is loved by people, favored by the numinous—\nIs it not because of his impartiality and *wu si*?\nThus he fulfills his own private essence.\n\nWhat others call *si* (private),\nIs to enrich oneself in desire.\nThe Sage, without *si*, yet himself is enriched—\nThus he fulfills his own private essence.\n\n**Master Rong** says:\nOrdinary beings are mired in desires, their spirit obscured,\nLacking absolute impartiality, harboring partiality.\nThey exalt themselves while burdening others,\nHoard for their own bodies while neglecting people,\nDesire to lead yet cannot transcend others,\nSeek preservation yet their bodies perish.\n\nThe Sage, without intent, desires to dwell first—\nNaturally he is first.\nWithout desires, seeks firm preservation—\nNaturally he is preserved.\nThus it is said: he fulfills his own private essence.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\nThis is his *wu shī* (no selfhood),\nThus he fulfills his *shī* (selfhood).\n*Shī* is the master—\nThe Sage, observing all things, sees emptiness in self and name,\nBoth void—\nThus he can set himself aside and lead others,\nForget self to aid others—\nThus he has no master.\nYet it is said he fulfills his *shī*—\nIn praise of the Sage’s virtue harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,\nLike a straw dog for the people,\nThus alone he dwells in the Three Realms’ exalted position,\nFulfilling the transformation of Heaven and humanity.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eight: The Chapter on Supreme Virtue**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nFor the prior chapter briefly illuminated the conduct of forgetting self,\nYet did not reveal its efficacy—\nThus this chapter expounds further,\nExtolling the person of forgetting self,\nWho possesses extraordinary abilities and wondrous functions.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct meanings unfold:\nFirst, it establishes *shàngshàn* (supreme virtue) with two analogies—law and metaphor.\nSecond, it broadly enumerates three abilities, elaborating seven virtues.\nThird, it concludes with praise for gentleness and weakness,\nThus free from blemish.\n\n**First: Establishing Supreme Virtue with Two Analogies**\nSupreme virtue is profound and mysterious,\nThe true essence, its secrets hidden.\nIt mirrors all phenomena in emptiness,\nGives birth to the Three Powers in spontaneity.\nThe gateway to all wonders,\nWhere all life converges,\nThe threshold of tranquil forgetting,\nWhere inert beings proliferate.\nHow shall we liken it?\nLike water filling a vessel to its brim,\nBecoming the boundless sea’s surging tide,\nLike the *Wèilú* Mountains containing the Yellow River’s flood,\nDraining the earth—\nThough vast and unfathomable,\nYet serene and supremely yielding,\nCleansing filth from the world,\nPreserving clarity within its nature.\nThus the Way’s function may be approached:\n**Supreme virtue is like water.**\n\n**Commentary** says:\nTo illuminate the Sage’s supreme virtue,\nWater’s nature is taken as an analogy to the Dao.\n\n**Commentary on the Commentary** says:\n*Shàngshàn* (supreme virtue) marks the person.\n*Ruò shuǐ* (like water) is the metaphor.\nThe Sage’s emptiness embraces all—\nWithout clinging to the law, yet virtue arises—\nThis is virtue’s summit.\n\nThe Sage’s conduct, like water’s function,\nIn the following text, all align with law and metaphor.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says:\nThe person of supreme virtue is like water’s nature.\n\n**Master Rong** says:\nSupreme virtue is like water—\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people revile,\nThus it nears the Dao.\nIts principles are profound and distant,\nHard to fathom—\nThe virtuous cultivating the Way,\nTheir actions are subtle and wondrous,\nThus water is borrowed as metaphor.\n\nWater nourishes things, the Dao aids people—\nThus it is said to benefit.\nWater yields to obstacles, the Dao is vast and equal—\nThus it is said not to contend.\nPeople often revile what is low, yet water flows downward,\nThe Dao practices humility—\nThus it is said to dwell where others revile.\n*Jì* (near)—water’s nature nears the Dao,\nThus it is taken as analogy.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:\nWater has two kinds—\nOne clings, one forgets—\nThis is forgetting virtue, thus called supreme.\nWater has many uses,\nThus it is paired as analogy.\nIts functions and virtues are listed below.\n\n**Master Jié’s Explanation** says:\n*Shàn* (virtue) refers to the *jīn* (saliva).\nRinsing with it yields sweet dew,\nSwallowing it benefits all spirits.\nIf you wish to practice this,\nMorning and evening, rinse the *Huá Chí* (Jade Pool),\nFilling your mouth with saliva,\nThen tilt your head to swallow,\nBenefiting all spirits and enriching your essence.\n\n---\n**Second: Broadly Enumerating Three Abilities, Elaborating Seven Virtues**\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people revile—\nThus it nears the Dao.\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*Jì* (near) means close.\n\n**Commentary on the Commentary** says:\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people revile—\nWater’s nature is sweet and cool,\nScattering everywhere, its dew nourishes all.\nThose it benefits grow—\nThus it is said to benefit—this is its first ability.\nUnder Heaven, none are softer than water,\nYet it can be modeled—\nIts clarity reflects others,\nFlowing, it submits to obstacles,\nFollowing its course—\nIt never contends—this is its second ability.\nIt reviles low places, yet people flock there—\nWater accepts filth, dwells in evil without complaint—this is its third ability.\nThus it nears the Dao—*jì* (near) means close.\nBenefiting others shows its vast efficacy,\nNot contending reveals its gentleness,\nDwelling in evil demonstrates its tolerance of defilement—\nThese are water’s three abilities,\nWhich the Sage embodies as one.\nHis conduct is not far from the Dao—\nThus it is said he is near.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says:\nWater benefits all things—\nIn Heaven, it is mist and dew;\nOn Earth, it is springs and rivers.\nYet it does not contend,\nDwelling where people revile—\nPeople revile what is low, damp, and filthy,\nYet water alone flows quietly there.\nThus it nears the Dao—\nWater’s nature nearly aligns with the Dao.",

all,\nIts efficacy widespread.\nThus it is likened to the Sage’s virtue.\n\nThe Sage’s virtue responds to all things,\nHis benevolent deeds are flexible and expedient,\nHis skillful means open and transform—\nTheir meaning aligns with water’s nature,\nHence the comparison.\n\nAgain, water does not contend—\nIts nature is gentle and yielding,\nIt does not vie with others,\nAdapting to square or round vessels,\nFilling or receding as people will.\nThe Sage’s highest conduct,\nIn responding to all things, is likewise.\n\nIt dwells in what people revile—\nWhat they revile are lowly places,\nAnd water alone resides there.\nPeople all seek the high and despise the low,\nTheir arrogance tramples others,\nYet the Sage alone forsakes the high to embrace the low,\nGentle, yielding, and still.\n\nThus it nears the Dao—*jì* (near) means close—\nHis conduct embodies these three abilities,\nHence it is near the Dao.\nWith the three abilities now explained,\nNext, the seven virtues are revealed.\n\n**Residing in the Virtuous Land**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nThe Sage’s highest virtue,\nIn his gentle and yielding conduct,\nIs like water dwelling in low places,\nNourishing all things.\nThe land is humble in its use,\nWater favors flowing downward—\nThus it is said the Sage resides in the virtuous land.\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s dwelling,\nExemplifies vast beneficence.\nLike water on Earth,\nIt brings abundant benefit to all.\nAgain, the land’s virtue lies in its humility,\nWater flows downward naturally,\nMatching the Sage’s meekness and compliance,\nNearly aligning with the Dao’s gentle nature—\nThus it is said he resides in the virtuous land.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nWater’s nature harmonizes with the land—\nAbove grass and trees, it flows downward,\nLike transformation, its movement subjugates all.\n\n**Rong says:**\nWater does not discriminate in its flow,\nIt moves wherever it is placed—\nThe Sage’s path is always virtuous.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nWater’s nature favors the low,\nFinding peace in downward flow.\nThe Sage’s highest virtue lies in humility,\nFor humility is auspicious—\nThus he dwells in low places,\nCalled the land of *non-contention*.\n\n**The Heart is Virtuous in Depth**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nA virtuous heart is deep and still,\nLike water’s settled clarity.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s heart,\nExemplifies profound tranquility—\nLike water’s nature,\nResting as a pure spring.\nWater’s stillness reveals its clarity,\nA quiet heart attains insight.\n\nThus it is said the heart is virtuous in depth.\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nWater’s heart is empty and profound,\nIts depths clear and bright.\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater’s heart is still yet clear,\nA human heart is empty yet reflective.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nDepth means still water—\nWater’s settled purity is clean and bright,\nIts depths unfathomable.\nThe Sage’s heart is like a boundless spring,\nStill yet illuminating—\nThus still water reflects all things,\nAn empty heart perceives all objects.\n\n**Generosity is Virtuous in Benevolence**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nGenerosity in giving aligns with the utmost benevolence,\nLike water’s nourishment of all things.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s vast compassion,\nAlways extends to others.\nGenerosity’s essence harmonizes with benevolent conduct,\nLike water’s nourishment—\nIt bestows without favor or aversion,\nThus it is said generosity is virtuous in benevolence.\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nAll things rely on water to thrive,\nIt gives to the empty, not the full.\n\n*Rong says:*\nWater harmonizes with all things,\nHumans benefit the common folk.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nBenevolence means grace—\nWater’s nature clings and moistens,\nIts grace nourishes all things.\nThe Sage’s virtue is compassionate and saving,\nHis grace extends to all beings—\nCompassion knows no bounds of enmity or kinship,\nMoistening does not discriminate between cold or foul.\n\n**Speech is Virtuous in Faithfulness**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nWords spoken are true and real,\nLike water’s flow through perilous paths,\nNever failing in its truth.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s highest speech,\nWords must be true and real,\nGuiding the common folk toward transformation,\nHis faithfulness never deceives.\n\nLike flowing springs,\nDo they differ from treacherous ravines?\nThus it is said speech is virtuous in faithfulness.\nThe annotation states: *Water flows through perilous paths yet never loses its truth*—\nThis is the language of the *Zhou Yi* [Book of Changes] on *Kǎn* [the hexagram of danger].\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nWater’s inner reflection mirrors all forms,\nIts clarity never

verification—\nEven the tides of the sea,\nThree times daily, never fail their appointed hour.\nMuch more so the Sage’s wisdom,\nWhich discerns all things,\nNever neglecting the three categories of beings.\n\n**Governance is Virtuous in Rectification**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nGovernance excels in proper ordering,\nLike water’s cleansing of all things,\nMaking them pure and cold.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nGovernance means uprightness—\nThe Sage in his affairs,\nActs without contrivance,\nHis uprightness guides all things,\nAnd all things follow naturally.\nUprightness brings self-ordering,\nWhat else could be called virtuous?\nLike water’s nature,\nIt cleanses all things,\nMaking them pure and serene—\nThus it is said governance is virtuous in rectification.\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nThere is nothing water does not cleanse,\nIts purity is vast and even.\n\n*Rong says:*\nGreat peace is none greater than still water,\nNo partiality exceeds the Sage’s virtue.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nWater’s nature is level and without bias,\nThe Sage’s heart is upright and rectifies all evil.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*In the midst of balance, the standard is set—\nThe great artisan takes his measure from it.*\n\n**Capability is Virtuous in Skillfulness**—\n*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:\nIn all affairs, his capability is skillful,\nLike water’s nature—\nSquare or round, it adapts to the vessel,\nNeither hindered nor obstructed by things.\n\n*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:\nThe Sage’s clarity and insight,\nIn all things, are without hindrance.\nWhatever there is to move or act,\nIn all affairs, he is proficient.\nProficiency is skillfulness,\nThis is his illuminated understanding.\nLike water’s nature,\nIt becomes a river when flowing,\nA pond when obstructed—\nSupporting boats, embracing emptiness,\nIt accomplishes all things—\nThis is its skillfulness.\n\n*御注* [Master He Shang

Thus, this chapter reveals the perils of worldly desires and self-inflicted blame, the reasons for which it follows. Here, one chapter unfolds three distinct teachings:\n\n1. **The dangers of clinging to desires with a fixed heart—prone to ruin.**\n2. **Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting calamity.**\n3. **Only humility, gentleness, and quiet retreat align with the Dao.**\n\n**1. The dangers of clinging to desires with a fixed heart—prone to ruin.**\nThe heavens and earth are vast crucibles of divine transformation, yet even their luminous forms—moon and sun—abide by the measure of waxing and waning, lest they falter. Mountains and rivers stand deep and firm, yet they endure the fate of collapse and exhaustion. How much more so we, mere mortals, who dare to grasp at fullness? We stamp our feet in the realm of sound and color, indulging our hearts in the duality of self and other. Our minds teem with wicked seeds, yet we remain blind to their absence of clarity; our hearts bristle with malevolent intent, yet we persist in delusion, secure and undisturbed. Like infants wailing in their cradles, we rise from the Three Palaces to lodge our complaints; like bones exposed to the elements, we drift through the Nine Abysses, unrecognized. The folly of a mortal’s life is thus inverted—truly blind, yet unseeing, and how deeply pitiable!\n\n**To hold yet overflow is not as good as simply ceasing.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* Grasping at fullness and overflow, preventing their loss, only burdens one with wealth—regret and stinginess arise thereafter. Thus, it is better to cease.\nCease means *to stop*.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* **Hold** is *to grasp*; **overflow** is *fullness*; **cease** is *to stop*.\nThe human heart, greedy and loving desires, endlessly seeks and takes, grasping and preserving to ensure fullness. Yet wealth becomes a burden, and regret and stinginess fester anew. Therefore, the Sage warns: *Better to rest than to persist*.\n\n*He Shanggong says:* Overflow is fullness; cease is to stop. To grasp at fullness guarantees its loss—better to stop.\n\n*Yan Junping says:* When one pollutes the paths of all beings with political schemes and the accumulation of wealth, the heavier the riches, the more one’s spirit and clarity are depleted. Wealth and gain, piling up, only breed the guilt of life and death—far better to cease before fullness is reached.\n\n*Li Rong says:* A tilted vessel, filled to the brim, must topple; excess and indulgence, once overflowing, must fail. If one wishes to avoid ruin and defeat, only humility and restraint suffice.\n\n*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* **Hold** is *to grasp*; **overflow** is *fullness*; **cease** is *to stop*.\nThose who cannot retreat in quietude nor embrace humility, who persist in grasping and seeking fullness, who boast of their greatness and scheme to overpower others—such folly will surely invite ruin. Better to stop than to act.\n\nThus, the *Zhuangzi* states: *\"Fill to the brim, and it will topple and perish.\"* And the *Book of Documents* says: *\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit.\"*\n\n**To probe yet sharpen is not long-enduring.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* To measure and sharpen one’s ambitions, pursuing honor and fame, will inevitably breed arrogance—sitting thus invites misfortune and blame. Hence, it cannot endure long.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* **Probe** is *to measure*; **sharpen** is *to whet*.\nWhen mundane emotions are sluggish and drowned, one clings to the pursuit of honor and gain. Thus, one measures past events, whets the heart’s desires, and invites the resentment of ghosts and men—sitting in such folly will surely bring misfortune and blame. Hence, it cannot endure long.\n\n*He Shanggong says:* **Probe** is *to govern*; one first governs by probing, yet later must abandon it.\n\n*Yan Junping says:* To whet one’s heart and sharpen one’s resolve, to strategize with cunning—when one’s wisdom grows sharp and one’s rank and reputation swell, one’s vitality wanes while the body advances. How can such a state endure long?\n\n*Li Rong says:* Honor invites censure; prosperity invites weariness. A sharp mind that stands out among others will be scorned by men—how can it endure long?\n\n*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* **Probe** is *to polish*; **sharpen** is *to refine*.\nTo polish a blade or whet a tool—though refined, they must surely wear. How much more so when one polishes and sharpens one’s own heart, demanding only of others, whose harm is greater than that of weapons? All things are my inferior, yet I persist—how can such folly endure long?\n\n*Commentary by Mengyang Qiangsi:* The upper **probe** refers to reckless speech; the lower **probe** refers to scattered spirit. Reckless speech invites war and strife; scattered spirit invites decay and loss—teeth falling, hair turning white.\n\n**2. Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting calamity.**\nGold and jade fill the halls—yet none can guard them.\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* This reveals that overflow cannot be long preserved.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Even if one ceaselessly demands and takes, filling halls with gold and jade—like the sun with teeth yet burning its own body, or the rooster with fear yet having its tail cut—one will lose the very treasures one sought to hoard, inviting the woes of bandits. How can such folly be guarded? This reverses the meaning of *holding yet overflowing*.\n\n*Commentary by Mengyang Qiangsi:* Without blood, there is no gold; without essence, there is no jade. If one can cultivate the *One*, the upper and lower will flow freely—rumbling within the belly like thunder, limbs and joints supported, eyes bright and responsive, in harmony with the *One*.\n\n*He Shanggong says:* Lustful desires weary the spirit; wealth burdens the body.\n\n*Yan Junping says:* Wealth and honor, like ice and coal—both cannot coexist. Honor and power are defilements of the spirit; gain and wealth are harms to the body. To nourish the spirit’s defilements and accumulate the body’s harms is to diminish the means of one’s flourishing while fostering the causes of one’s ruin. The more one gains in wealth, the more one’s *qi* is exhausted—how can it be guarded?\n\n*Li Rong says:* Gold and jade have no feet, yet they scatter of their own accord. Fire and water’s disasters cannot be repelled; bandits and thieves cannot be warded off. Thus, it is known: to hoard and gather is to lose the Way; to disperse and give is to conform with the Dao.\n\n*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* Desires excessive, the spirit grows weary; wealth accumulated, the body labors. When both body and mind are thus strained, none can guard them. Moreover, if one hoards without dispersing, great thieves will surely come. Within, one harbors grief and sorrow; without, one’s grasp weakens. When the body perishes, the wealth remains—thus, none can guard it.»",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nWealth and honor yet proud—one invites one’s own calamity.\n*Imperial Commentary:* This reveals the sharpness that cannot be measured.\nPride arises from the heart, hence the retribution comes not from others.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Heru* (遗), to bestow. Wealth invites others’ pursuit, hence one easily deceives things.\nHonor invites subservience, hence one takes to domineering others.\nWhen arrogance and excess reach their height, misfortune comes—who can blame?\nBecause of pride, retribution arises; pride stems from the heart—thus it is said, \"one invites it oneself.\"\nThis is the reversal of measuring sharpness.\n\n*River Above Master* says: When wealthy, one should relieve the poor; when honored, one should pity the lowly. Yet to indulge in pride and licentiousness is to invite disaster.\n\n*Yan* says: To be wealthy and honored yet not proud is easy to speak but hard to practice. The higher one’s station, the loftier one’s aspirations—yet to be proud in wealth and honor is like a torch meeting fire: the brighter the door, the faster the flame consumes. How can one not be cautious?\n\n*Li Rong* says: Accumulated wealth, if not dispersed, and riding honor to oppress others—retribution arises from within, not from without.\n\n*Cheng Exegesis:* *Jiu* (咎), an omen. *Heru* (遗), to bestow. Those in wealth and honor ought to aid others, yet failing to be modest, they grow ever more arrogant and swollen, bringing ruin upon themselves—how could it concern others?\n\n*Concise Explanation:* It speaks of those in wealth and honor who covet fame, riches, and bribes, unwilling to cultivate the Dao, until death comes. Even if one hoards money to the heavens, what use is it to the body? When the body dies, the name perishes. Only through humility, gentleness, and retreat does one align with the Dao of Heaven.\n\nWhen achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled, retreat is the Way of Heaven.\n*Imperial Commentary:* Those whose achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled should withdraw to decline prominence—this is not yet the Dao of Heaven. Only by observing the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness can one be free from worry and rest.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* This is a warning. Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit. Even Heaven does not remain perpetually full, so those whose achievements are complete meet ruin, and those whose reputation is fulfilled suffer decline. To seek enduring preservation—no such words have been heard. One must forget merit and step back, withdrawing from prominence like the Dao of Heaven, never losing the balance of fullness and emptiness, thus free from blame and worry.\n\n*River Above Master* says: When a person’s deeds are accomplished and reputation established, if they do not withdraw and avoid their position, they will surely meet disaster—this is the constant Dao of Heaven. Like the sun at its zenith moving on, the moon at fullness waning, things at their peak declining, and extreme joy turning to sorrow.\n\n*Li Rong* says: Yin and yang succeed one another; cold and heat shift in turn—this is the constant principle of things, the eternal Dao of Heaven. If one clings to honor without retreat, disaster follows. The exegeses thus perceive the signs; the Four Worthies departed in understanding, aligning with the principles of things and the Dao of Heaven.\n\n*Cheng Exegesis:* Heaven is the natural order. The sun at its zenith declines; the moon at fullness wanes—waning and fullness alternate, extremes reverse—this is their constant nature. Thus, those whose worldly achievements are complete and whose reputation is fulfilled must guard their station, know contentment, practice humility, gentleness, and retreat, dwelling in uncompetitive places, avoiding harm, and preserving life. Only thus do they deeply align with the true Dao of Heaven. Those whose achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled must withdraw and refine their conduct, acting naturally.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: Nurturing the Vital Essence (载营魄)**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous, which broadly expounded the faults of arrogance and the virtue of humility and retreat. Yet regarding the practice of the Dao’s path, its methods were still incomplete. Thus, this chapter elaborates on the inner and outer practices, detailing their functions step by step. Its meaning is divided into three parts: first, it clarifies restraining the spirit and subduing the vital essence, focusing on inner cultivation; second, it broadly displays the conduct of governing the state and benefiting others; third, it reveals the beauty of attaining the Dao and forgetting merit.\n\n**First: Restraining the Spirit and Subduing the Vital Essence, Guarding Oneness in Inner Cultivation**\n\nJust as rare trees flourish with fragrance and forest flowers bloom with charm, it is because their roots are deep and their stems firm, drawing nourishment from the dew. So too for humanity: the spirit and vital essence must be nourished, preserving harmonious *qi* to self-moisten, guarding humility and gentleness to achieve completion.\n\nWhen snow falls thickly, one must endure the toil of coming and going;\nWhen the rooster crows, one must add to the diligence of night and day.\nOne must ensure the vital essence and spirit are harmonious and at peace,\nLest the mind and spirit scatter and stray.\nKnow that Ziji controlled the white crane to part the clouds,\nOnly then did he realize the Master’s lute, riding the red carp, soared to the Han.\nIf one abandons true essence for mundane affairs,\nThe Dao’s sorrow is profound—how dark the common folk’s ignorance!\n\nNurturing the vital essence and embracing oneness—how could it ever depart?\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* At the beginning of life, the vital essence is called *po* (魄); once born, the *po* becomes *hun* (魂) with the rise of yang. The *po* is yin and empty, the *hun* is yang and full. It speaks of the initial bearing of empty *po*, which must constantly be nurtured and protected to restore yang. When yang *qi* fills the *po*, it becomes *hun*; if the *hun* can move, life is complete. *One* means \"unrestrained.\" To restore yang and preserve life, one must not be contaminated—thus, one must embrace and guard pure oneness, lest it depart from the body.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Zai* (载), initial. *Ying* (营), to protect. It says that at the start of life, one is but an empty form; once the *po* is born, yang *qi* fills the empty *po*. If the *po* can move, it is called *hun*—like the moon’s reflection illuminating the sun, generating light. Thus, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Zichan said: \"At the beginning of life, the vital essence is called *po*; once the *po* is born, yang becomes *hun.\"* It speaks of the initial bearing of empty *po*, which must be nurtured and protected, constantly ensuring yang *qi* fills it, thus preserving life. If movement is irregular and yang *qi* is dissipated, it reverts to empty *po* and perishes. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The mind near death must not restore yang.\" Thus, one must nurture and protect the empty *po*, restoring yang to preserve life, embracing and guarding pure oneness, lest it be contaminated—then life is complete. This teaches the nourishment of the spirit.\n\n*River Above Master* says: *Zai ying po* (载营魄), *ying* is *hun* (魂).",
      "overlap_context": " off. Thus, it is known: to hoard and gather is to lose the Way; to disperse and give is to conform with the Dao.\n\n*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* Desires excessive, the spirit grows weary; wealth accumulated, the body labors. When both body and mind are thus strained, none can guard them. Moreover, if one hoards without dispersing, great thieves will surely come. Within, one harbors grief and sorrow; without, one’s grasp weakens. When the body perishes, the wealth remains—thus, none can guard it.»",

      "translated_text": "「This is called *Mystic Virtue* (玄德), for the Dao/Way’s virtue is profound and unfathomable (玄冥), beyond direct perception, yet it seeks to guide people toward its nature.\n\n○ **Yan** (严) says:\n*Not possessing, not relying, not taking credit, not dominating* (不有不恃不以不宰),\nthe transformations are unfathomable (变化冥冥).\nThe heavens and earth regulate themselves naturally (天地自理).\n*Going without* (去为) is an analogy to illustrate the principle of teaching (譬以况理教).\nThe teaching’s words are said to be *possession* (有),\nyet the principle transcends all names and speech—*emptiness* (无).\nThe teaching’s practice is to clarify through the principle (因理而明),\nand the principle is elucidated through teaching (理之诠焉).\nBy teaching, the principle becomes manifest (由教而显),\nand the principle relies on teaching to reveal itself (理因教显).\nWithout teaching, the principle has no means of expression (无教理无所寄),\nand without the principle, teaching has no foundation (教籍理明).\nWithout the principle, what is teaching’s purpose (无理教何所说)?\n\nHaving understood the interdependence of principle and teaching (理教之相由),\none grasps how *possession* and *emptiness* serve as its essence (是体有无之为用).\n\n○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) cites *The Rites of Zhou – The Record of Craftsmen* (《周礼·考工记》):\n*\"Thirty spokes resemble the thirty days,\nto complete one month.\"* (三十辐象三十日，以成一月也)\n\nWhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe hub’s interior is hollow (箱毂内空),\nyet this very hollowness allows it to contain things—\nthus the wheel’s utility (只为空能容物，故有车用).\nConsider the scholar’s mind as emptiness (況学人心空),\nso it can bear the weight of all sentient beings (故能运载苍生也).\nMoreover, the wheel is but a *conventional name* (假名),\narising from the harmonious convergence of all conditions (诸缘和合而成).\nAnalyzing its nature thoroughly,\none finds its entirety is void and illusory (此车细析推寻，遍体虚幻).\nHow much more so for all dharmas (诸法),\nwhich are likewise in their entirety.\n\n*Molding clay to make vessels* (埏埴以为器),\nwhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe vessel’s utility is realized (有器之用).\n**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):\n*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和).\n*坛* (Tamped earth) refers to *clay* (土).\nThe potter harmonizes the clay,\nforging it into jars and pots (陶匠和土，为瓦缶之器也).\n\n**Yu’s Commentary** (御疏):\n*埏埴* (Molding clay) refers to *adhesive clay* (粘土).\nThe annotation says *potter* (陶匠),\nyet *The Book of Documents* (《尚书》) states:\n*\"To knead the earth is called pottery.\"* (范土曰陶)\nHere, the potter kneads and molds the clay,\nfires it into ceramic vessels,\nand takes advantage of their emptiness\nto hold and receive things (烧以成器，器中空虚，以用盛受物也).\n\n○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:\n*Molding clay to make vessels* (埏埴以为器),\n*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和),\n*坛* (Tamped earth) refers to *clay* (土).\nThe potter harmonizes the clay\nto create vessels for food and drink (和土以为食饮之器也).\nWhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe vessel’s utility is realized—\nits hollowness allows it to contain and receive (器中空虚，故得有所盛受也).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nTo *make vessels*, one must first harmonize the clay (作器必须和泥),\nand only when the clay is refined does the vessel serve its purpose (泥调则器可用).\nTo *cultivate the self*, one must purify conduct (修身理宜炼行),\nand only when conduct is pure does the Dao/Way manifest (行洁则道可成).\n*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和),\n*埴* (Clay) refers to *earth* (土).\n\n○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) again cites *The Record of Craftsmen* (《考工记》):\n*\"埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和).\n*値* (Clay) refers to *adhesive clay* (粘土).\nHarmonizing adhesive clay with water and earth,\nfiring it to form vessels—\nthough the vessel’s interior is empty,\nit is capable of containing and receiving (和粘水土，烧以成器，器中空无，故得盛受).\nThis illustrates how the scholar’s mind, being emptiness,\ncan embrace all things (況学人心空，故能容物).\n\n*Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling* (凿户牖以为室),\nwhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe dwelling’s utility is realized (有室之用).\n**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):\nIn ancient times, people dug caves to dwell in (古者陶穴以为室宇),\nand even these were furnished with doors and windows (亦开户牖),\nhence the term *carving* (故云凿耳).\n\n**Yu’s Commentary** (御疏):\n*凿* (Carving) means *piercing* or *hollowing* (穿).\n*牖* (Windows) refers to openings beside doors (门旁窗).\nIn ancient times, people lived in caves (穴居),\nso *The Book of Odes* (《诗》) says:\n*\"To dig and cover the cave\"* (陶复陶穴),\nmeaning they hollowed out the earth within the cave\nand covered it above—\nhence the term *carving* (穿凿穴中之土以复覆其上，故云凿耳).\nLater sages replaced this with official dwellings (官室),\nyet the principle remains:\nthe dwelling’s emptiness allows people to reside (取其室中空虚，所以人得居处).\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"If a dwelling has no emptiness,\neven wives and mothers-in-law will jostle for passage\"* (室无空虚，则妇姑勃蹊),\nmeaning they will *contend for the path* (勃蹊谓争路也).\n*The Er Ya* (《尔雅》) states:\n*\"Official halls are called dwellings\"* (官谓之室).\nThus, *possession* (有) is for *advantage* (利),\nwhile *emptiness* (无) is for *utility* (用).\nThe advantage of *possession* (有体利无)\nis that it relies on *emptiness* (以无为利),\nyet the advantage of *emptiness* (利铃资无)\nis that it depends on *possession*—\nhence *emptiness* is advantageous through *possession* (故有以无为利也).\nThe utility of *emptiness* (无之所用)\nis rooted in its form (用於体),\nyet its form requires *possession*—\nhence *emptiness* derives utility from *possession* (体必资有，故无以有为用也).\nThe annotation says:\n*\"That which transcends form is called Dao/Way* (形而上者曰道),\n*that which is beneath form is called vessel* (形而下者曰器),\nas written in *The Systematic Words of the Yi* (《易·系辞》).\nWhen it is purely *emptiness*, it is called Dao/Way (自无则称道),\nand when it involves *possession*, it is called vessel (涉有则称器).\nTo clarify the Dao/Way’s utility,\none must use form and vessel as analogies (欲明道用，必约形器以彰).\nThough these analogies employ the three illustrations,\nthe ultimate aim remains to emphasize *emptiness* in all governance (终用无於一政耳).\n\n○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:\n*Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling* (凿户牖以为室)\nrefers to constructing houses (谓作室屋).\nWhen it is *emptiness* (当其无),\nthe dwelling’s utility is realized—\ndoors and windows are hollow,\nallowing people to enter and exit (户牖室虚，人得以出入).\nObserving the dwelling’s emptiness,\npeople can reside within—\nthis is its utility (观视室中空虚，人得居处，是其用也).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nIf a dwelling is not hollow within,\nand lacks doors and windows without,\nits utility is not difficult to grasp (其为用不以难乎).\nYet the Dao/Way is inwardly obscure and dark (内既暗昧),\nexternally deaf and blind (外复聋瞽),\nand seeking it thus is no easy matter (以此求道，理非易乎).\nA dwelling with doors and windows is useful (室开户牖，有用也).\nSo too, when a person’s wisdom is enlightened,\nthe Dao/Way is accomplished (人生慧解，道成之).\n\n○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):\nTo pierce and hollow doors and windows,\nto construct houses—\nthough the interior is empty,\nit allows people to reside (穿凿户牖，以为屋室，室中空无，故得居处).\nConsider the scholar’s mind as emptiness,\nso it can embrace all things (況学人心空，故能覆物).\nMoreover, piercing and hollowing doors and windows\nallows passage for people,\nyet emptiness in the roots and orifices\npermits use without attachment (況根窍虚通，故能用而无染).\nThe three analogies—wheel, vessel, and dwelling—\nshare similar meaning,\nyet they are repeated for emphasis:\nthe wheel is for motion but not stillness (车则动而不静),\nthe dwelling is for stillness but not motion (室则静而不动),\nthe vessel is both motion and stillness (器则亦动亦静).\nThese three distinctions\nare why they are restated (有此三异，故重出之).\nThe second purpose is to distinguish *possession* and *emptiness*,\nand to clarify their interdependence (显明资导).\nThus, *possession* is for *advantage*,\nand *emptiness* is for *utility* (故有之以为利，无之以为用).\n\n**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):\n*Possession* relies on *emptiness* for advantage (有体利无),\nand *emptiness* is advantageous through *possession* (以无为利).\n*Emptiness* derives utility from *possession* (无用体者),\nand *possession* is the means of *emptiness’* utility (以有为用).\nMoreover, that which transcends form is called Dao/Way (形而上者曰道),\nand that which is beneath form is called vessel (形而下者曰器).\nTo elucidate the supreme Dao/Way’s utility,\none must use form and substance as analogies (将明至道之用，约形质以彰).\nThus, one borrows the coarse advantage of *possession* over *emptiness*\nto clarify the subtle utility of *emptiness* in *possession* (故借粗有之利无，以明妙无之用有耳).\n\n○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:\nThus, *possession* is for *advantage* (故有之以为利),\nfor things benefit from their form (物利於形),\nand vessels contain things while dwellings shelter people—\nyet one fears the house may collapse (器中有物，室中有人，恐其屋破坏).\nThe stomach contains the spirit (腹中有神),\nyet one fears the body’s decay (畏其形之消亡也).\n*Emptiness* is for *utility* (无之以为用),\nfor only within the void can one contain and receive (虚空中者，乃可用盛受物),\nhence it is said: *\"The void governs the form of possession\"* (故曰虚无制有形).\nThe Dao/Way is emptiness itself (道者空无也).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nIf there is only *possession* and no *emptiness*,\n*possession* alone cannot be advantageous (有不得为利).\nIf there is only *emptiness* and no *possession*,\n*emptiness* alone cannot serve its purpose (无不得为用).\nThis makes clear that *possession* depends on *emptiness* for advantage (明有因无以为利),\nand *emptiness* depends on *possession* for utility (无因有以为用).\nHaving recognized how *possession* and *emptiness* interdependently arise (既识有无之相因),\none naturally understands the coarse and subtle as mutually reliant (自知粗妙之相籍也).」",

am bound by the body,\nand thus know it as great affliction.\"*\n\nWhen I have no body, what affliction could I have?\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nHe who knows that heaven and earth are in harmonious accord,\nand none of it belongs to me—\nabandoning form, discarding wisdom,\nrealizing the body is not the body,\nuniting with the Dao—\nwhat affliction could there be?\n\n**Imperial Commentary (expanded):**\n*\"No body\"* means one who comprehends the body’s form as empty and illusory,\nitself not real—\nthen one must sit in *zuowang* (sitting-forgetting), abandoning perception,\ncollapsing the body, discarding hearing,\nmerging with the boundless Dao’s non-attachment,\naligning with heaven and earth’s non-possession—\nnaturally, the paths of honor and disgrace vanish,\nand the hearts of love and hatred cease.\nThis is what is meant by *\"the Emperor’s suspended resolution\"*—\nwhat further bondage to great affliction could there be?\nThus it is said: *When I have no body, what affliction could I have?*\nThe note on *\"commit and accord\"* comes from Zhuangzi’s response to Shun:\n*\"The body is not yours—it is heaven and earth’s committed accord.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang** said:\nIf I have no body, and attain the Dao naturally,\nlightly ascending to the clouds,\nentering and exiting without obstruction,\ncommuning with the Dao—\nwhat affliction could there be?\n\n**Master Yan** said:\nRest the mind in Dao and virtue,\nrecord the will in spirit and clarity—\nharmony is the central master,\nserene as if unborn,\na plan beyond planning,\ncrafting heaven and earth,\na concern beyond concern,\nsoaring in the boundless dark,\npreserving and forgetting in transformation—\nnot distinguishing these as strange.\nHonor and disgrace, high and low—\nno excess, no deficiency.\nValuing the great, it perishes in the body—\nthus great affliction cannot take hold,\nnor can the heavenly net ensnare.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nEmptying oneself, forgetting the heart—\nthis is having no body.\nThe afflictions of right and wrong arise from the body;\nif the body is forgotten,\nthen death and life cannot burden,\nhonor and disgrace cannot disturb—\nwhat affliction could there be?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nIt is only because of *having* that the body becomes affliction;\nif the body is already nonexistent,\nwhere could affliction lodge?\nThus, *I have no body, where would affliction attach?*\nThe *\"nonexistent\"* refers to *zuowang*, losing the self,\ncollapsing the body, abandoning form—\nthis is the body having no body.\n*\"Nonexistent\"* is not annihilation, but simply *nonexistent*.\n\nThe third comparison reveals gain and loss in valuation.\nThus, *valuing the body as the world*\nis like being able to

concludes with entrustment—\nif one is startled by honor and disgrace,\nit means one has not forgotten honor and disgrace,\nhas not forgotten valuation and love.\nThus, comparing disgrace to honor,\ndisgrace is not as grave as honor;\ncomparing love to valuation,\nvaluation is not as deep as love.\nThose startled by honor and disgrace\nstill harbor concern for honor and disgrace,\nand those who retain valuation and love\nhave not yet forgotten the world entirely.\nThus, first it makes one startled by honor and disgrace,\nthen it seeks to make one forget both honor and disgrace—\nusing the name of entrustment\nto distinguish the extreme of forgetting,\nforgetting honor and disgrace,\nhaving nothing left to startle,\nforgetting the body means no root of affliction,\nforgetting the world means no pretension of entrustment.\nOnly then does one have the *Supreme Sovereign* above\nand the *Submissive Minister* below—\ndoing nothing yet achieving all,\nhaving no virtue yet possessing virtue.\n\n**Imperial Commentary (expanded):**\nThe ruler who prizes his body as the world’s master,\ndeeming himself above others,\nrisks being temporarily

people,\nruling forever without answer.\n\n**Master Rong** said:\nThe Supreme Sovereign values virtue, not the body;\nthe enlightened king loves the people, not himself.\nIf one can do this,\nthen one can endure.\nIf one values the body and belittles others,\nloves oneself while hating others,\none cannot align with heaven and earth’s benevolence,\nequal the sun and moon’s illumination—\nthen it is

      "translated_text": "「夷」 is called *Yi*—smooth and simple. The **Dao/Way** is not a color, so it cannot be seen. Yet within the realm of no-color, it can manifest all colors; thus, it is named *Yi*.\n\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\nThis passage elucidates the **Dao/Way**. Those who seek to see it do so through color, those who seek to hear it do so through sound, and those who seek to grasp it do so through form. But the **Dao/Way** is neither color, sound, nor form—thus, all such seeking fails.\n\nBecause it cannot be obtained through such means, one might say it is \"nonexistent.\" Yet within no-color, it manifests all colors; within no-sound, it harmonizes all sounds; within no-form, it assumes all forms. Thus, it possesses *Yi*—color without color, *Xi*—sound without sound, and *Wei*—form without form. Therefore, it is called *Yi Xi Wei*.\n\n*Yi Xi Wei* refers to what is called \"illuminating the **Dao/Way** but not the **Dao/Way** itself.\" *Yi* is smooth and simple. *Xi* is the subtle and profound nature of sound. *Wei* is the grasp of form.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\n*\"Yi\"* means no-color—one without hues, unseen yet perceived. It cannot be grasped through sight alone.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\nIs the **Dao/Way** distant? The eyes cannot see it. Yet the sage comprehends it, perceiving its clarity alone, and thus names it *Yi*. *Yi* is plainness; the Great **Dao/Way** is utterly simple, naturally good and effortlessly wise.\n\n○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:\n*\"Yi\"* means plainness—speaking of the ultimate subtlety of the **Dao/Way**, its essence transcends the five colors, so it cannot be discerned by the eyes. Thus, it is called *Yi*—smooth and equal, without variation.\n\nHearing it yet not hearing is called *Xi*.\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\n*Xi* is the subtle sound. The **Dao/Way** is not sound, so it cannot be heard. Yet within no-sound, it alone harmonizes all sounds; thus, it is named *Xi*.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\n*\"Xi\"* means no-sound—one without audible tones, yet heard through the spirit.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\nThe Great Sound is subtle without voice; the ears cannot hear it. Yet the sage penetrates its depths, hearing its harmony alone. It is called *Xi*—profound and elusive, teaching hard to encounter. *Xi* is the natural way.\n\n○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:\n*Xi* means simplicity and fewness—its essence is not the notes of the five tones, so it cannot be grasped by the ear. Thus, it is called *Xi*—the subtle.\n\nTouching it yet not obtaining is called *Wei*.\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\n*Wei* is the grasp of form. The **Dao/Way** has no shape, so it cannot be held. Yet within no-form, it alone assumes all forms; thus, it is named *Wei*.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\n*\"Wei\"* means no-form—one without tangible substance, yet perceived through spirit alone. It cannot be grasped by touch.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\nThe Great Symbol is formless, hard to touch. Yet the sage’s profound insight knows the void, and thus *Wei* is the subtle mechanism. It moves and responds to things, surpassing all distinctions of existence and non-existence.\n\n○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:\n*Wei* means subtle and wondrous—its essence is not corporeal, so it cannot be touched. Thus, it is called *Wei*—the subtle and wondrous.\n\nAgain, *Master Zang*’s threefold unity refers to *spirit-qi-essence* (神炁精). *Spirit* (精) is the name for luminous wisdom, *God* (神) is the function beyond measure, and *Qi* (炁) is the aspect of form. The sage unites these three into one.\n\nIf it is unseen, that is *spirit*; if unheard, that is *God*; if untouchable, that is *Qi*. Yet since it is unseen, unheard, and untouchable, one might say it is no-color and no-form. But why then speak of *Yi Xi Wei*?\n\nThe ultimate **Dao/Way** is indeed without color, yet it does not utterly vanish. If it vanished entirely, it would merge with the *Great Void* (太虚), leading to a denial of perception. Now, it is named *Yi Xi Wei*—color without color, sound without sound, form without form—thus the term.\n\nThe second meaning is: though three, it is one; though one, it is three. These three cannot be questioned, so they are merged into one.\n\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\nThese three—*Yi Xi Wei*—are meant to question the **Dao/Way**, but the **Dao/Way** is neither sound, color, nor form. Thus, questioning yields no answer, and only *Yi Xi Wei* is obtained. The **Dao/Way** is not *Yi Xi Wei*, so the three are merged into one.\n\n○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:\nThese three—*Yi Xi Wei*—cannot be questioned. *Zhi* (致) means to obtain, *Jie* (诘) means to interrogate, and *Hun* (混) means to merge. The wondrous origin is subtle and profound; *spirit-qi-essence* are hard to name. How can one interrogate with color, sound, and form?\n\nIf one interrogates with color, sound, and form, only *Yi Xi Wei* is obtained. Yet if one calls it *Yi Xi Wei*, it is but a borrowed name. To truly reveal the **Dao/Way**, one must know that it is not sound, color, or form—thus, *Yi Xi Wei* is merged into one.\n\n○ *Master He Shang* said:\nThese three cannot be questioned—*Yi Xi Wei*. The mouth cannot speak of them, nor can scriptures transmit them. They are received with stillness, sought with spirit, and cannot be interrogated to obtain. Thus, they are merged into one. *Hun* means to combine, so the three are combined into one name.\n\n○ *Rong* said:\n*Yi Xi Wei* are the three. All are beyond sound and color, transcending form and name, so they cannot be questioned or measured. Merged into the undifferentiated, they are named as one.

tranquil, void yet penetrating.\nIts practice is also supremely delicate and minute,\nunobstructed and without stagnation.\nWhen action aligns with the Dao, it becomes unfathomable and hard to know—\ncannot be spoken of, for the speaker is not the Dao;\ncannot be perceived, for the perceiver strays from the true.\nThus it is said: *unrecognizable*.\n\n○ Chéng’s commentary: The ancient *shànwéishì* (善为士者, \"those who skillfully cultivated the Dao\")\n—*gu* (古, \"ancient\") is *xī* (昔, \"of old\"),\n*shàn* (善, \"skillful\") is the opposite of *è* (恶, \"evil\").\n*Wéi* (为, \"cultivate\") means *xiūxué* (修学, \"to study and refine\").\nThe previous chapter held ancient principles to govern the present,\nwhile this chapter governs the present by invoking the ancient,\nthus presenting the *xī* (昔, \"of old\") *shàn xiūdào zhī shì* (善修道之士, \"wise ones who refined the Dao\")\nas a model for those who seek to learn.\nSubtle and mysterious, yet profound beyond recognition—\n*wéimiào* (微妙, \"subtle and essential\") is the wisdom to cultivate,\n*xiāntōng* (玄通, \"mysterious and penetrating\") is the realm to be refined.\nRealm and wisdom converge,\nand both cultivator and object are deep—\nit cannot be grasped by the mind,\nthus it is praised as *unrecognizable*.\n\nSecondly, they manifest outward form\nto guide others in their cultivation.\nFor only the *unrecognizable* can thus guide:\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Since the Dao’s virtue is hard to recognize,\nthey manifest outward form to reveal it—\nreferring to the following passage.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Form (容, *róng*) is appearance (相貌, *xiàngmào*).\nThe Dao is hard to contemplate,\nits practice hard to perceive—\nlest those who come later lack the preparation to grasp the Dao,\nor learners fail to establish proper conduct,\nthe following passage briefly outlines outward form\nto encourage and exhort them.\n\n*Chéng’s commentary*: Form (容, *róng*) is outward appearance (形貌, *xíngmào*).\nThis *unrecognizable* wisdom of the sages\nis most worthy of guiding others.\nNow seeking to draw in all ranks of practitioners,\nthey thus manifest outward form\neven in the Dao’s formless principle.\n\nLike one crossing a winter river—\n*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yù* (豫, \"prepared\") means *xián yù* (闲豫, \"leisurely ease\").\nThe *shànshì* (善士, \"wise ones\") of old, hearing the Dao in their times,\nwere like crossing a winter river—\nthe masses cling to desires,\nthus they feared and hesitated.\nNow I am untainted,\nso I am at ease.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yù* (豫, \"prepared\") means *yóuyù* (犹豫, \"hesitation\"), hesitation born of fear.\nIt speaks of those who study the Dao,\nfearing the entanglements of worldly affairs and desires,\nas one crossing a winter river—\nthe heart trembles with dread,\nfearing to sink or drown.\nThis reveals the purity of their intentions.\n\nLike one fearing the neighbors—\n*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yóu* (犹, \"like\") is hesitation (疑难, *yí nán*),\n*wèi* (畏, \"fear\") is dread.\nNow I am untainted—\nas mentioned above, the *shànshì* (善士) do not cling to desires,\nyet when observing their conduct,\neach movement and action is met with suspicion,\nlike a man fearing his neighbors’ awareness.\nAs those of old,\nwhen facing affairs, they dreaded the scrutiny of their neighbors,\nthus they were cautious and restrained.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: To dwell in the world yet act wickedly,\none fears neighbors and kinsmen may awaken to their deeds.\nTo follow the Dao and do good,\none fears the *yōumíng* (幽明, \"hidden and manifest\")\nmay censure their shortcomings.\nThis reveals the purity of their speech.\n\nLike a guest in solemnity,\nlike ice about to melt—\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Though they appear solemn as guests,\nwith no artificial deeds,\nthey do not cling to things—\ndissolving like spring ice, scattering away.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: The *shànshì* (善士) do no harm to desires,\nlike guests facing their hosts—\nsolemn and respectful.\nThough they face desires as guests do their hosts,\ntheir virtuous conduct does not cling to things—\ndissolving like spring ice,\nunimpeded and free.\n\n*Yuè’s commentary*: Like a guest in solemnity,\none must act only when necessary—\ncultivation of the Dao should not be reckless.\nLike ice about to turn to water,\nwhen spring’s warmth arrives, the ice melts,\nand the mysterious wind arises, dissolving all burdens.\n\n*Chéng’s commentary*: Like a guest in solemnity—\n*yǎn* (俨, \"solemn\"), the bearing of dignity.\nThe *Jì* (记) says: *\"Yǎn ruò sī\"* (俨若思, \"solemn as in contemplation\"),\nmeaning those who study must restrain and discipline their body and mind,\nnot indulging in recklessness,\nlike a guest facing their host—\nthey must not be

In **rectifying and aiding** (匡辅), one must uphold **loyalty and rectitude** (忠正). Though aged, one returns to youth; though in **defilement** (敝), one renews. Those who study the Dao must **empty their hearts** (虚心) and abandon **sensual pleasures** (声色), while **washing away their worries** (澡虑) and **cleansing their disputes** (荡於纷争).\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: Only the **sage of discarding the middle** (遣中圣人) can, within the realm of **action** (有为) and **defilement** (敝浊), still **compassionately rescue** (慈救) the **masses** (苍生) and achieve **great virtue and merit** (大功德). This is the **double attainment** (重结成).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Attainment of the Supreme Void (致虚极章)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which elucidates the **meeting of perception and wisdom** (境智相会), thereby enabling the **marvelous attainment of the Supreme Mysterious** (妙极重玄). Thus, this chapter is placed next.\nIt reveals the **fruit of the Supreme Mysterious Dao** (重玄道果). In this chapter, the meaning is divided into three aspects:\n1. **Briefly marking the Dao’s fruit** (略标道果) to encourage beings to begin cultivation.\n2. **Exhorting a return to the origin and source** (劝返本还源), merging with the **root** (根) and **reclaiming the vital breath** (复命).\n3. **Illustrating the progression from small to great** (示从小入大), **wondrously aligning with the Supreme Void** (妙契虚玄).\n\n1. **Briefly marking the Dao’s fruit** (略标道果) to encourage beings to begin cultivation.\nThe **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **true essence** (真宗). Those who **quietly forget** (恬忘) its **vital principle** (要者) enter the **abode of the Rare and Strange** (希夷之奥), dwelling in the **dim and vague** (惚恍之先). Their **principle transcends all non-conformity** (理绝百非).\nThey may **recite the Four Sentences** (言忘四句) or **wander in the upper realms** (游上界), sitting upon **Péngyǔ** (蓬岳) and **concentrating their spirit** (凝神). At times, they descend to the **lower mundane** (下凡), holding a **boat’s oar** (舟航) to **assist beings** (接物).\nThey open the **vast expanse of the Dao’s realm** (大囿之境), and the **heavens and earth embrace it without limit** (天地纳之而不穷). They dwell in the **subtle and minute** (细微之中), yet even the **finest hairs and tips of grass** (毫末) cannot be sought to find them.\nTheir **principle is clear and free from strife** (厥理清争), and their **non-thinking is without announcement** (其不思告). Those who **quietly retreat** (静退) must **approach the Supreme Void** (臻虚极之道).\n\n**The Attainment of the Supreme Void** (致虚极) is **to steadfastly guard stillness** (守静笃).\n*Yù’s Annotation*: The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **wondrous origin** (妙本). It is said that all beings, upon taking birth, **inherit the Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (禀虚极妙本). Once they receive form and **begin to take and hold** (受纳), then the **wondrous origin disperses** (妙本离散).\nNow, if one wishes the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) to **necessarily manifest in the body** (致於身), one must **abandon dusty perceptions and attachments** (弃尘境染滞) and **steadfastly guard the female-stillness** (守此雌静笃厚). Then the **Supreme Void’s Dao** (虚极之道) will naturally **govern the body** (政於身).\n*Yù’s Commentary*: The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **wondrous origin** (妙本). It is said that all beings, upon taking birth, **inherit the Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (禀虚极妙本), which is their **original nature** (正性). Once they receive form, the **six senses cling to pleasure** (六根爱悦), and the **five desires vie in competition** (五欲奔竞), then the **original nature disperses** (正性离散), and they **lose the wondrous origin** (失妙本).\nNow, if one wishes the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) to **manifest and govern the body** (爻自政於身), one must **steadfastly guard the female-stillness** (守此雌静), **cultivate a profound and thick nature and disposition** (笃厚性情), and **sever desires** (绝欲). Without **narrowing** (狭) yet **not wearying**, the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) will naturally **manifest and govern the body** (自政於身).\nThis is like **water flowing to dampness** (流湿) and **fire tending to dryness** (就燥).\n**Attainment** (致) means to **invite it to manifest** (令爻自来), as in the **classical meaning of \"attaining a teacher\"** (如春秋致师之义).\n*He Shànggōng* says: **The Attainment of the Supreme Void** (致虚极) is when the **cultivator abandons emotions and desires** (修道之人捐情去欲), **cleansing the five viscera** (五内清净), and **attaining the Supreme Void** (致於虚极).\n**To steadfastly guard stillness** (守静笃) is to **guard purity** (守清净) and **practice profound virtue** (行笃厚).\n*Róng* says: If their **nature is upright and pure** (性正而贞), and their **conduct is clear and distant** (行清而远), those who **guard it with profundity** (守之厚者) may attain the **Supreme Void’s Dao** (虚极之道).\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Attainment** (致) means **to obtain** (得也). The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **fruit of the Dao** (道果). **Profound** (笃) means **central** (中也). It is said: If one wishes to obtain the **fruit of the wondrous and supremely void** (虚玄极妙之果), one must **quiet the heart and guard the central Dao** (静心守一中之道), then it may be obtained.\n\n2. **Exhorting a return to the origin and source** (劝返本还源), merging with the **root** (根) and **reclaiming the vital breath** (复命).\nAll things arise together; I observe their **return** (复).\n*Yù’s Annotation*: The **Laozi** (老君) says: How do we know that **guarding female-stillness** (守雌静) can **attain the Supreme Void** (致虚极)? We observe all things in **motion and action** (动作). Once we observe their **return** (归复), it is always in **stillness** (静), hence it is so.\n*Yù’s Commentary*: This clarifies that **steadfastly guarding stillness** (守静笃) **necessarily attains the Supreme Void** (必致虚极). All things and all forms, though their **motions and actions differ** (动作不同), once observed in their **return** (归复), always abide in their **origin** (本). The *Yìjīng* says: *\"Thunder within the earth—this is **Return** (复).\"* **Return** (复) means **to revert to the origin** (反本之谓也). Hence, **stillness returns** (静则归复), while **motion loses the origin** (动则失本).\n*He Shànggōng* says: All things arise together—**arise** (作) means **birth** (生也). All things are born together; I observe their **return** (复), meaning I observe all things, and they **all revert to their origin** (皆归其本). Thus, one should **contemplate their origin** (念其本).\n*Yán* says: It begins with **non-action** (无为), moves with **formlessness** (无形), **emerges in harmony with the seasons** (发於时和), thereby **fulfilling great success** (遂成功).\n*Róng* says: All things arise together—ordinary people cannot **guard non-action to maintain stillness** (守无为以安静), and for **emotions** (情) they **move and act** (动作), abandoning **truth** (真) to follow **deceit** (伪), losing their **origin** (本) and **pursuing the trivial** (逐末).\nI observe their **return** (复)—**return** (复) means **origin** (本). Ordinary people **lose their origin and pursue the trivial** (失本而逐末), **abandoning purity to enter impurity** (离淳以入浇). The **sage suppresses the trivial and honors the origin** (圣人抑末而崇本), **returning impurity to restore simplicity** (返浇以还朴).\n*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Arise** (作) means **to move and act** (动用也). It is said that all beings, in their **arising and acting** (并皆云为), **covetously grasp at external phenomena** (贪逐前境). Yet with the **Laozi’s holy wisdom** (老君圣智) observing them, all **revert to the wondrous origin** (复在妙本), whether in motion or stillness.\n\nThe myriad things, though **flourishing and diverse** (芸芸), **each return to their root** (各复归其根).\n*Yù’s Annotation*: Again, it is said: How do we know that all things **return to stillness** (归复), always abiding in **stillness** (静)? Because all things, in their **flourishing and diverse** (花叶芸芸), **naturally revert to their roots** (生性皆复归於其根). Hence, though they **arise in flourishing diversity** (有作芸芸), their **motions and actions** (动作) all return to their **roots and origins** (根本).\n*Yù’s Commentary*: This illustrates the **meaning of observing their return** (观复之意). The **root** (根) is where the **origin receives qi** (本所受气) and **gives rise to form** (而生也).",

**can contain all things** (故能容物).\n**Containing is *gōng*** (容乃公).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **To embrace and respond to all things** (含容应物), **to respond without attachment** (应物无心), **having no partiality or deceit** (既无私邪), hence it is **the essence of impartiality** (故为公正也).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **One who can embrace and respond to all things** (能含容应物) **is impartial and without favor** (乃公正无私), **and thus all under heaven will follow** (无私则天下归往), **which is called *wáng*** (是谓王矣).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Without failing to contain anything** (无不包容), **one attains impartiality and lacks favor** (则公正无私), **and no malevolent force can withstand** (众邪莫当也).\n**Yóng** says: **Impartial without favor** (正而无私).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: *Gōng* means **levelness** (平也). **Since one can embrace all things** (既能包容庶物), **thus one attains impartiality and lacks favor** (所以公正无私). **Impartiality is *wáng*** (公乃王).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **Those who are impartial and lack favor** (能公正无私者), **will be followed by all things** (则为物所归往).\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Impartial and without favor** (公正无私), **one can rule all under heaven** (则可为天下王). **To govern oneself with rectitude** (治身正) **is to unify the form** (则形一), **and to illuminate one’s spirit** (神明千万), **all harmoniously resonating within oneself** (共奏己躬).\n**Yóng** says: **Partiality cannot harmonize with things** (偏私不堪宰物), **but impartiality can preside over all** (公正可以君临也).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: *Wáng* means **to follow** (往也). **Because one encompasses all things** (只为包含万物), **being impartial and without favor** (公正无私), **thus one becomes the Great Law King** (所以作大法王) **whom all under heaven follow** (为苍生之所归往). **The King is *Dào*** (王乃天).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **All things joyfully submit** (群物乐推), **like Heaven’s universal coverage** (如天之覆), **thus one’s virtue aligns with Heaven** (则与天合德也).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The King’s virtue aligns with Heaven** (王德如天), **thus one acts without contrivance yet all things are in order** (则无为而理), **and the Dao’s transformation is set in motion** (道化乃行), hence it is said: **the King is *Dào*** (故云王乃天).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **The King can harmonize virtue with the spirit** (王能德合神明), **thus one is in communion with Heaven** (乃与天通也).\n**Yóng** says: **Universal coverage without attachment** (无心广覆), **operating in accordance with the seasons** (运行以时).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Having already become the Great Law King** (既作法王), **encompassing all sentient beings** (化主), **and being followed by all things** (为物所归), **one further shelters and covers all sentient life** (复荫覆含灵), **in equality with the boundless Heaven** (同於昊昊). **Heaven is *Dào*** (天乃道).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The King’s virtue mirrors Heaven** (王德如天), **thus one can practice the Dao** (乃能行道).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The virtue of the King aligns with Heaven** (王德合天), **thus one can endure the Dao’s course** (则久享福祚), **and the people of all under heaven gather toward it like the sun** (天下之人就之如日), **revere it like Heaven** (戴之如天), **benefit from it like rain** (泽之如雨), **and anticipate it like spring** (望之如春). **Then until one’s death** (则终殁其身), **what peril or danger remains?** (复何危殆之事？) Hence it is said: **to die is not to perish** (故云殁身不殆).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **To be in harmony with the Dao** (与道合同), **thus one can endure long** (乃能长久).\n**Yóng** says: **The Dao endures eternally from antiquity** (道则自古以固存), **and the Sage enjoys boundless, timeless life** (圣则永享无期寿也).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **The measure equals the Great Emptiness** (量等太虚), **with neither coming nor going** (无来无去). **The heart merges with the Supreme Dao** (心冥至道), **neither annihilated nor born** (不灭不生). **Since this aligns with the above** (既与此相符), **hence it is said to be enduring** (故义说为久). **To die is not to perish** (殁身不殆).\n**Yù’s Exegesis**: **To act in accordance with Heaven’s Dao** (同天行道), **then even at one’s final moment** (则终殁其身), **there is no peril or danger** (长无危殆之事矣).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** says: **One who can be impartial and a King** (能公能王), **united with Heaven and the Dao** (通天合道), **refined in purity and vast in virtue** (四者纯俗), **with Dao and virtue ever expansive** (道德弘远), **suffers no calamity or blame** (无殃无咎), **and perishes with Heaven and Earth** (与天地俱没), **yet remains unthreatened** (而不危殆也).\n\n**Yóng** says: **To perish is to reach one’s end** (没，终也). **To align with Heaven is to endure** (与天为期), **and to harmonize with the Dao is to last** (与道同久), **thus one’s finality is within this very body** (终於此身), **forever free from peril or danger** (永无危殆).\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **To perish means to vanish without trace** (没，灭也). **To not perish means to be without danger** (殆，危也). **To hide one’s essence and erase one’s form** (匿端灭迹) **is called to perish within the body** (谓之没身). **To respond to sensations and act in accordance with circumstances** (应感赴机) **is called to not perish** (谓之不殆).\n**Alternative Explanation**: **The form has rise and fall** (迹有兴废), hence it is said **to perish within the body** (故言没身). **The essence is without birth or death** (本无生灭), hence it is said

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Seventeen: *Dàoshàng Xià Zhī* (The Supreme Sovereign Knows Only That There Is Something Above)**\n\n**The Supreme Sovereign’s chapter follows the previous one**, for the prior chapter expounds the **Ultimate Mystery of the Dao’s profound essence**, urging all beings to begin cultivation. Thus, this chapter is placed next, revealing **the responses and transformations that follow in due course**, descending from the **root to its outward manifestations**.\n\nWithin this chapter, two distinctions are made:\n1. **The disparity in innate nature and varying levels of enlightenment**.\n2. **The sigh over the hidden operation of the Supreme Virtue**, where wisdom is yet ignorance.\n\n**1. The disparity in innate nature and varying levels of enlightenment**\nThe **Sovereign of Lu** (栗陆) and **Hèxiū** (赫胥) ruled as sovereigns in their respective ages, yet both adhered to the **Supreme Dao**, not engaging in artificial governance. Their reigns brought **peace to the Twelve Emperors**, and their glory endured for **tens of thousands of years**. The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) ruled without action or contrivance, neither above nor below knowing anything, and not entangled in affairs. The people lived like wild deer, the sovereign like a **marking branch** (标枝)—a natural symbol of leadership. The land became a **realm of the Great Dao**, and all things flourished in the **field of Huàxiū** (华胥). The **true qi** was thick and profound, their nourishment pure and harmonious; they followed the **natural inclinations of the Dao**, embodying the **uncarved simplicity of Tàipǔ** (太朴). Their lives were long, their hearts sincere—**how was this achieved?** It was truly **reliant upon the power of non-action**.\n\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is known only as something above (下知有之).\n\n**Explanation of the passage:**\nIt refers to **knowing the Supreme Sovereign above (the *dàoshàng* of the *nìhuán* 泥丸) and the lower *dàotiān* (丹田)**, where the union of *yīn* and *yáng* occurs in the *jiàngguān* (绛官). By closing the heart and grasping the essence, the **original qi** flows, and the ears perceive the **divine sounds**. When one knows the **lower abdomen’s resonance** (腹呜) and governs it with **single-mindedness**, the sounds of **bells and drums** emerge.\n\n**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **primordial ruler of antiquity**. *Xiàzhī* (下知) means that the subjects **know there is a ruler above**, revering it as the heavens, yet **without any trace of artificial governance or contrivance**, so the people **lack virtue yet still proclaim it**.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **primordial ruler of antiquity**. It is called \"Supreme\" because it is **held in highest reverence**. The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) rules through **non-action**, teaching without words. The subjects merely know that there is a ruler above, revering it as the heavens. The **Supreme Sovereign** is great and above all, **bearing the beauty of the four seasons’ nurturing**, yet the subjects **do not know how to ascribe virtue to it**, hence it is said, **\"only that there is something above\"** (下知有之).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) refers to the **nameless ruler of the Great Antiquity**. *Xiàzhī* (下知有之) means the subjects **know there is a ruler above yet do not serve it**, for their affairs are **simple, unadorned, and pure**.\n\n**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the ruler of **Supreme Virtue**. Since virtue is **ineffable** and its name is **hard to define**, it is only said that the **Great Person** (大人) is above. The passage **alludes to the Supreme Sovereign**, who **embraces the Dao and Virtue**, yet **requires nothing from below**. Below is **self-sufficient**, above **receives no tribute**. Between the sovereign and subjects, above and below, **there is only the knowing that there is something**.\n\n**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **Great Dao’s Teacher of All Beings**. The **Dao’s Sovereign** abides **above the Jade Capital** (玉京) and **within the Golden Gate** (金阙), where the mind **concentrates and drifts in boundless contemplation**, dwelling in the **eternal response**. Those with **keen innate roots**, whose **enlightenment is bright and profound**, deeply grasp the **mystery of the essence**, and their minds **concentrate yet are boundless and tranquil**. Their bodies transcend **form and name**, descending from the **root and manifesting outwardly**—thus they have a **title**, yet **do not cling to appearances**. Hence it is said, **\"only that there is something above\"** (下知有之), meaning they **know the origin of the name \"Supreme Sovereign\"**.\n\nNext, **the sovereign is beloved and praised**.\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nWhen the **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) passes away, the **Yellow Emperor**, **Yáo**, and **Shùn** emerge, **applying teachings and performing benevolence**, extending their **virtue to the common people**. Thus they are **beloved**. Their **gentle governance brings harmony**, and their **achievements surpass the world**—thus they are **praised**. This **love and praise arise from the people’s traces**, yet **such artificial governance becomes a calamity for future generations**, hence *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) says: **\"I tell you! The root of great chaos lies between the ages of Yáo and Shùn. Its end persists even a thousand generations later.\"**\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:\nTheir **virtue is visible**, their **benevolence and grace can be praised**—thus they are **beloved and praised**.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** (严君平) said:\nWhen people **delight in being sovereigns**, they are called **Emperors**.\n\n**Explanation by the *Jiéshuō* (节解):**\n**Beloved** refers to the **spirit** (魂), **praised** refers to the **shadow** (魄).\n\n**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:\nThe **ruler of lower virtue** (下德之君) **engages in contrived governance**, yet **cannot forget words**. Above, the sovereign is **trusted and revered by the subjects**; below, the sovereign is **praised by those above**.\n\n**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):\nThose of **medium innate roots**, whose **enlightenment is somewhat dim**, **cannot forget words to verify truth**, and must **grasp forms to cultivate**. Thus they **cling to scriptures and teachings**, **cherishing and praising** the sovereign in **artificial reverence**, generating **emotions through texts**, and **mutually flattering** one another.\n\nNext, **the sovereign is feared and scorned**.\n**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nWhen **virtue declines further**, the sovereign **imposes many faults in governance**, and the people **cannot endure his rule**. Then the sovereign **drives them with punishments**, hence they **fear him**. When **emotions are indulged and deceit prevails**, the sovereign **cannot discern truth**, hence they **scorn him**.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nWhen the **Yellow Emperor**, **Yáo**, and **Shùn** pass away, descending to the **Three Kings and Five Hegemons**, their governance **grows increasingly oppressive**, with **harsh laws and severe punishments**—thus they are **feared**. Their **inability to discern truth** leads to **scorn**. Below, they **accuse the guilty to seek merit**; above, they **reward the wicked to foster deceit**. Thus mutual deception arises, **causing hearts to grow cold**.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:\nNext, **they fear him**, establishing **laws and punishments to govern them**. **They scorn him**, for his **many prohibitions and burdensome decrees** cannot **inspire sincere allegiance**, hence they **deceive and scorn him**.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** (严君平) said:\n**Sighing and lamenting**, he is called **ruler** (王).\n\n**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:\nUnable to **follow the transformations of all things** or **trust in nature’s spontaneity**, they **establish laws and punishments to threaten them**—thus it is said, **\"feared\"**. With **many decrees and the people deceiving below**—thus it is said, **\"scorned\"**. This is the **degeneration of the ancient order**.\n\n**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):\n**Scorn** is **deceit**. Those of **low innate roots**, whose **nature is dull and emotions unbridled**, **indulge their hearts in sensory pursuits**, growing **ever more entangled**. They **fear only worldly punishments**, not the **retribution of the netherworld**, hence they **deceive and scorn the sacred words**, **defaming and rejecting them**. Thus the *Dàodé Jīng* (道德经) says: **\"The petty scholar hears the Dao and laughs at it.\"**\n\n**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThose who **fear and scorn the sovereign** arise **from the sovereign’s lack of trustworthiness**, hence the people below **also have those who do not believe**.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**\nThis **reverses the explanation of \"fear and scorn\"** (畏之侮之).",

      "translated_text": "「The common folk fear the sovereign’s teachings and decrees, all because the sovereign’s trustworthiness is insufficient among them, hence the people below also come to have such unfaithful ones.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: *\"Insufficient trustworthiness\"* means the sovereign lacks trustworthiness among the people below, so the people below then have clever and deceitful subjects. *\"There are those who do not believe\"* means the people below respond with disbelief and deceive their sovereign.\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: As the ruler above, one should **transform** (化) them with the **Dao/Way**; one should **demonstrate** (示) trustworthiness. If the ruler can trust the people below, the people below will also trust the ruler. If the ruler can trust the people below, the people below will also trust the ruler above.\n\n○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): Precisely because the people below are burdened by **innate roots** (机) and **trustworthy roots** (信根) are insufficient, they doubt and defame the sacred texts, incurring the crime of disbelief. Hence, the **Dao/Way** is held in contempt.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): *\"To honor and praise\"* (亲之誉之) refers to the sovereign having words of **virtue/power** (德) and teaching (教), hence the people honor and praise his words.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): This **reverses the explanation** of *\"to honor and praise\"* (亲之誉之也). The common folk thus honor and love the sovereign’s benevolence and goodness, and praise the sovereign’s accomplishments and deeds, because the sovereign has words of **virtue/power** (德教) and teaching (教), hence they hold his words in high regard and praise them.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: When the **Sovereign of the Highest** (太上之君) undertakes actions, they are still held in high regard as words. This is to **fear departing from the Dao/Way** and losing **naturalness** (自然).\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: This refers to the time of antiquity (中古之时), when one had not yet forgotten words (未能忘言). Words were borrowed to convey meaning, and mutual honor and praise were given. Hence, words were emphasized.\n\n○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): The false and superficial words of the worldly (世俗浮伪之言) are why they do not know the **true and real teachings** (至道真实之教) of the **Dao/Way**. Thus, confusion and delusion grow deeper with time, and their **karmic obstacles** (罪障) increase.\n\n**Second sigh:** The **highest virtue/power** (至德) is hidden and unmanifest, yet the people remain unaware in their daily lives. When accomplishments are fulfilled and undertakings completed, the common folk say, *\"The Sovereign of the Highest acts naturally.\"*\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): When accomplishments are fulfilled yet the ruler does not cling to them, and undertakings are completed yet the ruler takes no action, the common folk live their daily lives unaware, saying, *\"The Sovereign of the Highest naturally achieves and fulfills this.\"* Then, the **Sovereign of the Highest** remains unknown below.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): This **reverses the explanation** of *\"the Sovereign of the Highest remains unknown below\"* (太上下知也). If the **Dao/Way** is pure and uncorrupted (淳朴不残), who would make the **sacrificial offerings** (牺樽)? If the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (道德) are universally practiced (公行), why would there be any need for honor and praise (亲誉焉设)? Hence, in the age of the **Sovereign of the Highest**, the people below forget the **imperial force** (帝力), and only when accomplishments are fulfilled and undertakings completed do the common folk regard it as natural and fitting, unaware of why they honor and praise benevolence and kindness.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: *\"Accomplishments fulfilled and undertakings completed\"* refers to the **Great Peace** (太平) of the world. *\"The common folk say, 'The Sovereign of the Highest acts naturally'\"*—the common folk do not know that the sovereign above possesses **pure and profound virtue/power** (德淳厚), instead believing it is their own natural course.\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: The **imperial Dao/Way** (帝皇之道) is to **achieve great accomplishments** (隆功成). The **wind of non-action** (无为之风) is to **complete undertakings** (着事遂). Earlier, the three ancient stages were explained: the **Dao/Way** was lost, and **virtue/power** declined, from **pure antiquity** (淳) to **corrupted later times** (浇), then again returning to **pure antiquity** (淳). The **Dao/Way** is shallow and easily seen, while **virtue/power** is high and difficult to perceive. Now that the **sacred transformation** (圣化) is profound and the **divine accomplishments** (神功) are unfathomable, the people remain unaware in their daily lives, saying it is natural. Hence, *\"the Sovereign of the Highest remains unknown below.\"*\n\n○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): The **accomplishments of the Dao/Way** (亭毒之功成) and the **fulfillment of nurturing life** (生育之事遂) are such that the **highest virtue/power** (至德) remains hidden, yet the ruler does not claim credit for the success. Thus, the common folk live their daily lives unaware, saying, *\"The Sovereign of the Highest naturally attains such things,\"* without knowing they should **rely upon the sacred grace** (荷圣恩).\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao/Way is Abandoned**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which explained how **Dao/Way** manifests from its **original root** (本) and descends into **traces** (迹), adapting to circumstances (随机). Hence, this chapter follows to clarify that once the **traces** (迹) are established, the **mysterious root** (妙本) is concealed.\n\nWithin this chapter, there are three layers of meaning:\n1. It explains that when the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) then appear.\n2. It explains that using **wisdom** (智) to govern things is the **source of artifice and deceit** (娇诈之源).\n3. It distinguishes how **loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝) arise due to **disorder** (为乱).\n\n**First layer:** When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) then appear.\n\nThe **Five Emperors** (五帝) were pure and flowing (淳流), while the **Three Kings** (三王) were **corrupted and competitive** (浇竞). Because the **Dao/Way of knotted cords** (结绳道) was abandoned and **martial affairs** (干戈事) arose, **Yīn** (殷) then practiced **sacrificial offerings** with **sliced hearts** (赤血剖心), and **Zhōu** (周) used **white flags** (白旗) to **display severed heads** (枭首). When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) is abandoned, the world falls into disorder (崩离). **Wú and Yuè** (吴越) perished through **conquest and slaughter** (伐国亡躯), while **Zhī Chéng** (之呛) lost his life through **surrendering power** (禅权绝命). The meaning of losing the **Dao/Way** is evident here.\n\nThus, it is known that the **sacred governance** (圣治) has no **action** (为), and the **mysterious wind** (玄风) of the **Dao/Way** (道) is ever-present (长扇). Even **straw dogs** (刍狗) and all things are not **cherished as one’s own** (不亲其亲), yet the ruler **accepts offerings from the common folk** (纳惶) in fear, and **comforts the suffering masses** (吊百姓之涂炭). They speak of *\"joy\"* (乐) and *\"joy\"* (乐), yet why do they use **bells and drums** (锺鼓)? They speak of *\"rites\"* (礼) and *\"rites\"* (礼), yet the **elaborate funerals** (雕丧) are such as these. When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) is abandoned, there is **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义).\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): When **purity is dispersed** (浇淳) and **simplicity is lost** (散朴), the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail. Daily, **benevolence** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) arise, yet they are but small accomplishments (小成遂作). The **moist and weak** (濡沬) stem from insufficiency, while **decay and exhaustion** (凋弊) arise from **action** (有为). Yet the **sage’s intent** (圣人救伐之心) is never different; the **traces of leveling and smoothing** (夷险之迹) cannot be unified.\n\n○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): The **Great Dao/Way** (大道) refers to the time when **purity was dispersed** (浇漓) and **simplicity was lost** (散朴). The **mysterious wind** (玄晏之风) of the **Dao/Way** (道) is extinguished, and the **tranquil transformation** (穆清之化) does not exist. They have lost the **highest virtue/power** (至道) of **non-action** (无为), hence it is said to be abandoned. When abandoned, there arises **compassionate love** (兼爱) as **benevolence** (仁) and **judging what is wrong** (裁非) as **righteousness** (义). Thus, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) are interspersed among them. Hence, *Zhuāngzi* (《庄子》) says: *\"The Dao/Way is hidden in small accomplishments.\"* It means that **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) and others each achieve their own ends, yet cannot **greatly harmonize** (大通), hence they are called *small accomplishments* (小成).\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: In the time of the **Great Dao/Way** (大道之时), **filial piety** (孝) was found in every household, and **loyalty** (忠) was found in every state. Thus, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) were not seen. When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) was abandoned and **evil and perversity** (恶逆) arose, then **transformations of righteousness** (化义) emerged, yet the **Dao/Way** was not transmitted.\n\n○ **Róng** (荣) said: In the realm of **Emphasizing the Mysterious** (重玄), the **phenomena of qi** (气象) cannot be shifted, and in the **principle of utmost emptiness** (至虚之理), the **void** (空) is not yet worth discussing. If one cannot **respond and adapt** (迎随), what is the **beginning** (始) or **end** (终)? If there is no **change in flourishing and decline** (盛衰无变), what is **arising** (兴) or **abandoning** (废)? On the day of **purity and simplicity** (纯粹之日), there is no separation between **near and far, states and families** (彼此不隔、州、亲疏). In the time of **tranquility and peace** (静泰之辰), there is no distinction between **high and low, noble and ignoble** (上下不彰於贵贱). The **natural harmony** (自然符会) occurs without need for **knotted cords** (结绳). One treads upon the **Great Square** (大方), needing no **written contracts** (书契). When the **true time** (真时) reaches **oneness** (至一), it is said that the **Dao/Way** arises. When one practices **partial love** (偏爱) as **benevolence** (仁) and **judges wrongness** (裁非) as **righteousness** (义), the **corruption and shallowness** (浇薄) begin, and they cannot practice the **Dao/Way** (道), hence it is said that the **Dao/Way** is abandoned.",

      "translated_text": "The times shift between **corruption and purity** (浇淳), yet the **Dao/Way** knows no rise or fall (道无兴废).\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** This is when the **Supreme Sovereign’s Teaching** (太上之教) is abandoned.\nIt is said that in the **Age of Great Dao**, the **Five Virtues** (五德) are not manifest, and when **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) arise, **purity and simplicity** (淳朴) are lost. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Dispersing virtue and power into benevolence and righteousness is the crime of the sages.\"* Again, it says: *\"Mutual moistening in conversation is not as good as mutual forgetting in the rivers and lakes.\"* The second point clarifies that **governing through wisdom** (以智治物) is the source of **artifice and deceit** (矫诈). When **wisdom and insight** (智惠) emerge, **great falsehood** (大伪) follows.\n○ **御注:** Those who employ **wisdom and insight** (智惠) are about to establish laws (将立法也). When laws are enacted, deceit arises, and thus **great falsehood** emerges. Even **sealing official seals** (窃符玺) cannot be trusted.\n○ **御疏:** When **wisdom** (智慧) emerges, it refers to later generations using wisdom to legislate, establishing laws to curb the people and decrees to punish deceit. Fearing disbelief, they create **seals and insignia** (符玺) to authenticate them. Fearing injustice, they use **measuring tools** (斗斛) to quantify. Yet, the unvirtuous steal seals and measuring tools, undermining the original intent of wisdom’s laws. Thus, wisdom’s governance only magnifies deceit, hence it is said that **great falsehood** arises.\n○ **River Master (河上公) says:** The **wise ruler** (智慧之君) devalues **virtue** (德) and prizes **words** (言), devalues **substance** (质) and prizes **ornament** (文). The people respond in kind, and this becomes the root of **great falsehood and deceit** (大伪奸诈).\n○ **Honor’s Commentary (荣曰):** **Dim and silent** (昏昏默默) is the **ultimate of the Dao**. **Obscure and murky** (昧昧晦晦) is the **peak of practice** (行之至). Unable to shine without dazzling, they abandon **knowledge and convention** (去知与故), adorn **wisdom** (饰智慧) to astonish the simple, and vie in **right and wrong** (竞是非) to lead the masses. When **right and wrong** alternate endlessly, **deceit and cunning** multiply. **Thieves and bandits** (盗跖) tread this as the **Dao**, while **ambitious ministers** (田成) exploit it to usurp the state—this is **great falsehood**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** **Wisdom** (智慧) here refers to **sagely wisdom** (圣智). When the **sage governs through wisdom**, laws and decrees proliferate, and the people respond with countless deceits to evade punishment. They even steal the **sage’s wisdom** as tools for falsehood—**wisdom’s harm** is fully revealed in *Zhuangzi’s* text.\n\nThe third point distinguishes the **arising of loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝之兴) as the cause of **chaos** (因乎为乱). When **six kinships** (六亲) are not harmonious, **filial piety and kindness** (孝慈) emerge.\n○ **御注:** Father, son, husband, wife, brothers—these are the **six kinships** (六亲). When **kinship and affinity lack order** (疏戚无伦), they are not harmonious (不和). Each clings to their own kin and children, and thus **filial piety and kindness** arise. All stem from abandoning the **Dao**, hence these **partial names** emerge.\n○ **御疏:** The **six kinships** (六亲) are father, son, brothers, and spouses. In the **Age of Great Harmony**, there is no selfish kinship. When **superior and inferior** become discordant, **grievances and favors** arise, leading to **pillow-warming and blanket-sharing**, which people call **filial piety**. Covering when entering, shielding when exiting, which people call **kindness**. Though adorned with the names of **filial piety and kindness**, they bear the air of **self-aggrandizement**, unaware that in the **Age of Great Dao**, the world is a single household, with the **sovereign supporting above and soothing below**—a natural order. To view others as oneself, not just loving one’s own kin, then **all under heaven may be filial**. If others treat you as oneself, not just cherishing one’s own children, then **all under heaven may be kind**. Thus, where do the names of **filial piety and kindness** apply?\n○ **River Master (河上公) says:** When the **six bonds of kinship** (六纪) are severed and **kinsfolk are discordant**, then **filial piety and kindness** arise to nurture one another.\n○ **Honor’s Commentary (荣曰):** Father, son, brothers, and spouses—these are the **six kinships**. When distinctions blur, **right and wrong cease**, yet **long and short** contrast, giving rise to **likes and dislikes**. Harmony is marked by **disharmony**, and **filial piety** is established through **ingratitude**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** The **six kinships** are father, son, brothers, and spouses. In an age of **pure harmony**, partial love is not yet manifest. When the **six bonds of kinship** (六纪) are disordered, **filial piety and kindness** take form. Thus, when **Zhou’s virtue declined**, **corruption and competition** surged, leading to **Zengzi and Min’s** exalted **filial piety** as a display of virtue.\nWhen a state is **in chaos and darkness**, **loyal ministers** (忠臣) arise.\n○ **御注:** In times of **great peace**, all are self-sufficient—what need is there for such names?",

      "translated_text": "The days of chaos and darkness see **loyal ministers** risking their lives to save their lord—then **loyal ministers** arise.\n\n○ **御疏:** Loyalty is the duty of a subject, yet why speak of **\"loyal ministers\"**? It is because the ruler fails to govern his ministers properly, allowing flatterers to advance, to serve a **corrupt lord**, and thus bring about calamity. Then those who see danger and risk death to rescue the state earn the name **\"loyal ministers.\"**\nWhen the **Dao/Way** flourishes in its purity, with **non-action** and tranquility, the multitude of **noble worthies** are all **Qí-Lóng**—virtuous and sagely—with **proper relationships** in order, and none but **natural conduct**. Only then do the names **\"loyalty\"** and **\"filial piety\"** fade, and the **pure and unadorned Dao/Way** prevail. What need then for **\"loyal ministers\"**?\nThese four are the extreme of decline—how could they not return to **purity and simplicity**?\n\n○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** When **governance fails**, the ruler and subjects blame each other, and **wicked schemers** vie for power—then **\"loyal ministers\"** arise to rescue their lord.\nThis shows that in a world of **great peace**, none know **benevolence**; when all desires vanish, none know **tranquility**; when all act purely for themselves, none know **integrity**.\nIn the **Age of the Great Dao/Way**, **benevolence and righteousness** fade, **filial piety and kindness** vanish—just as at high noon, the sun’s brilliance obscures the stars.\n\n○ **Master Róng (荣) says:** In the time of **Xī and Nóng**, no need was heard of **supporting ministers**; in the days of **Jié and Zhòu**, only then were **loyal ministers** like **Guān Yǔ and Bǐ Gān** praised.\nThus, when the sun shines brightly in the sky, the stars cannot compete in their radiance; when the timely rains fall, the irrigation channels cannot claim their merit. If the lord is **corrupt above** and the ministers **rebellious below**, yet one arises to **support the lord internally** and **pacify external threats**, then the name **\"loyal minister\"** shines forth.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** A **sovereign of a great state** rules over the **Four Seas** as his domain. Thus, in times of **perfect governance**, **loyalty** is unseen; in times of **chaos**, **virtuous integrity** becomes manifest. Hence, **Lóng Fēng** was renowned in **Xià Jié’s** reign, and **Bǐ Gān** was praised in **Shāng Zhòu’s** time.\n\n---\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**\nThis chapter follows the previous because the last spoke of the **Great Dao/Way** having declined, and thus **sages and wise men** arose. Hence, this chapter urges **discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom**, returning to the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nNow, dividing the meaning of this chapter into three parts:\n1. **First**, it clarifies that **discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom** brings **great benefits**, to guide beginners.\n2. **Second**, it laments that the **Great Vehicle** cannot be grasped by inferior capacities.\n3. **Third**, it briefly opens the essential gate, guiding beginners onward.\n\n---\n**1. First, it clarifies that discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom brings great benefits, to guide beginners.**\n\nA **ruler who embraces the Dao/Way**, concentrating his mind in inward illumination, then **his body aligns with the earth’s vastness** and **nurtures all**, his **virtue/power** is **round and luminous**, **pure and clear**. He **transcends the dust of the ages**, **serene in the world’s subtlety**, **free from worldly wisdom**, and **acts beyond conventional thought**.\nLike **Yáo**, his virtue **spreads universally beneath Heaven**; like **Shùn**, his **virtue/power** flows **unobstructed across the land**. Then all things **fulfill their nature in the Dao/Way**, and affairs **rest in the True**. Thus, **artifice and deceit vanish from human conduct**, and **loyalty and filial piety** return to **natural inclination**.\nTo **practice these three**, one finds **self-sufficiency**—why seek the **four limbs of knowledge** or **many learned words**? **\"Seeing the unadorned\"** requires **little thought**; this is a **later warning**.\n\n**Discarding the sage, abandoning wisdom—**\nthe people’s benefit is **a hundredfold**.\n\n○ **御注:** **Discarding the sage’s** teachings and traces, then **transformation rests in non-action**. **Abandoning worldly wisdom’s** deceit, then **people return to purity and simplicity**. **Purity and simplicity** mean **artifice and deceit do not arise**; **non-action** means **self-aggrandizement is not practiced**.\nWhen **heaven and humanity** are in harmony, and **all things lose not their nature**, then the people enjoy **a hundredfold benefit**.\n\n○ **御疏:** **\"Sage\"** refers to those who **craft and create**; **\"wisdom\"** refers to **worldly cunning and deceit**. The **sage’s craft** leaves traces, and **worldly wisdom** is not true.\nLosing **truth** gives rise to **artifice and deceit**; following **traces** leads to **losing the root**. Thus, both must be **discarded and abandoned** to preserve **purity and simplicity**.\nWhen **heavenly harmony** flows freely and **self-aggrandizement** ceases, the people gain **a hundredfold benefit**.\n\n○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** **\"Discarding the sage\"** means **rejecting crafted institutions**, returning to **primordial simplicity**. The **Five Emperors** drew symbols, **Cāng Jié** invented writing—yet this is inferior to the **Three Sovereigns’** **knotted cords without script**.\n**\"Abandoning wisdom\"** means **rejecting clever stratagems**, returning to **non-action**. The people’s benefit is **a hundredfold**: **agriculture flourishes**, and **public and private** are **unified**.\n\n○ **Master Róng (荣) says:** **\"Sage\"** is what the **common mind** reveres; **\"wisdom\"** is what the **foolish seek**. Without **wisdom**, how could one **discern circumstances**? Without the **sage**, how could one **govern affairs**? Yet now it is said to **discard and abandon**—this is unheard of.\nWhen the **sage arises**, **thieves multiply**; when **wisdom is used**, **bandits appear**. Now it is said to **discard**—then **thieves and bandits do not rise**. The benefit is indeed **great**; briefly, it is **a hundredfold**.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** **Discarding** the **named sage**, **abandoning** **discriminating wisdom**, all return to their **roots**—the benefit is **extremely great**. Speaking of **\"a hundredfold\"** is but **taking the greater number**.\nThus, *Zhuāngzǐ* says: **\"Rú wine is thin, Hán Dān is besieged—when the sage appears, great thieves arise.\"**\nAgain, **Tián Chéngzǐ**, with his **sage-like wisdom**, **seized the state of Qí**—such are the examples.\n\n---\n**Discarding benevolence, abandoning righteousness—**\nthe people **return to filial piety and kindness**.\n\n○ **御注:** **Discarding** the **benevolence of universal love**, **abandoning** the **righteousness of judging right and wrong**, then the people **return to great filial piety and kindness**.\n\n○ **御疏:** The previous chapter spoke of the **Great Dao/Way’s** decline and the rise of **benevolence and righteousness**. Now it says to **discard benevolence and abandon righteousness**, yet the people **return to filial piety and kindness**, showing that in the **age of the Great Dao/Way**, **\"mystical unity\"** prevailed—**no private kin existed**, all were **kind and filial**.\nThus, when **principles are perfect**, **traces vanish**; when **affairs are right**, **names fade**.\nNow, when the **six bonds of kinship** are **broken**, then the **names of filial piety and kindness** shine forth. If **universal love** is **discarded** and **judging righteousness** is **abandoned**, then **no stains of partiality remain in the rivers and lakes**, and **filial kindness** rests in **natural substance**. Thus, the people **return to great filial piety and kindness**.\n\n○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** **\"Discarding benevolence\"** means **rejecting the kindness of benevolence**; **\"abandoning righteousness\"** means **rejecting the superficiality of righteousness**.",

      "translated_text": "**Ceasing Learning Brings Peace**\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\nTo abandon the artificial learning of the vulgar world, one preserves the purity of nature undisturbed. With few desires and little selfishness, one attains true rest and freedom from care.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThose who cease learning do so by abandoning the artificial learning of the vulgar world. All humans are born with an innate purity. The more one exceeds natural limits in pursuit of learning, the more one harms this purity. If one completely ceases all action, one would leave all things unrefined. But here, it is only the excessive, artificial learning—what Zhuangzi called *vulgar learning*—that must be abandoned to return to one’s original state. As for the learning inherent to one’s nature, the superior person cultivates it diligently through action; this is not the same as ceasing learning. Thus, it is said: *Ceasing learning brings peace.*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nCeasing learning does not mean abandoning true learning; it means removing superficiality, thus attaining peace and rest.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nVulgar learning teaches one to value trifling distinctions, to know the customs of social gatherings and partisan debates. The virtuous benefit from it, but the wicked are harmed by it. Since virtuous people are few and the wicked many within the world, the benefits of learning are shallow while its harms are deep. When the wicked engage in learning, it is like a tiger gaining wings—soaring over the four seas, selecting flesh to devour. The Sage rejects this, and thus the world rests in peace, transforming without instruction and submitting without command.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nIf one’s aspiration is the Dao of non-action, then there is no need for learning. Blending the wise and foolish, one does not hear of gain or loss. In advancing or retreating, one remains in forgetfulness, unaffected by praise or blame. Embracing the natural Way, how could there be any care?\n\nThose who cling to artificial pursuits learn not for themselves but for external gain—straining their heads and piercing their thighs to compete for fame, studying by candlelight to contend for profit. They fear that their reputation will not stand, that their gains will not come, and thus anxiety arises.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Worry\"* means burdensome cares. To abandon learning rooted in artificial distinctions and merge with the principle of non-action is to exhaust all burdens, hence there is no worry.\n\nHow far apart are *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"*? How different are *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"*?\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\n*\"Yes\"* is a respectful response; *\"agree\"* is a careless one. Though both emerge from the mouth, one is said to be close. A respectful response is good, while a careless one is evil. This illustrates that ceasing vulgar learning brings peace, while failing to do so breeds suffering—all depending on the mind’s reflection. How could the distance be great?\n\n**Exegesis:**\n*\"Yes\"* means to respond appropriately. The *Rites* say: *\"When the master summons, do not answer with ‘yes’ before rising.\"*\n\n*\"Agree\"* is a careless response. The *Book of Han* says: *\"Who dares to question?\"*—meaning, *\"Who dares to ask?\"* This is an illustrative analogy. Though *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* both come from the mouth, one is respectful and good, the other careless and evil. If learning is not abandoned, the fault lies in the mind; but if abandoned, there is no worry—only if neglected does suffering arise. Since both emerge from the mouth, they are said to be close. But the distinction lies in the heart, hence the question: *How far apart are they?*\n\nIf one realizes that learning and non-learning are both empty, that all distinctions are void, and forgets knowing in knowing, then *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* become equal, and good and evil are both forgotten.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"Yes\"* and *\"agree\"* are both responses, yet how close they are—how the times despise substance while valuing form. Good and evil—how different they are! The good are praised, the evil are reproached. How far apart can they be? Does the age despise the honest and honor the flatterer?\n\n**Master Rong says:**\n*\"Yes\"* is the proper response in ritual; *\"agree\"* is the informal reply. What aligns with the heart is good; what contradicts it is evil. *\"How close\"* means the distance is not great. To embody the Dao is to dispel all concerns; to follow nature is to find all paths suitable. In truth, there is neither opposition nor compliance, neither beauty nor ugliness. Yet artificial distinctions force separation, giving rise to partiality and delusion. One clings to trivialities, neglecting the realm of virtue and morality, demanding only superficial propriety. If it pleases the heart, it is called *\"right,\"* regardless of wisdom or folly. If it flatters oneself, it is called *\"able,\"* without regard for intelligence or ignorance. Thus, the wise become as foolish as the unwise, and the virtuous as base as the wicked. Hence, it is said: *\"How close they are.\"*\n\nIt is also said that human nature is inherently fixed. To nurture it excessively leads to loss, to advance intelligence for empty praise, to adorn deceit for wicked deeds—*\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* differ only slightly, hence *\"how close they are.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Yes\"* is a respectful affirmation; *\"agree\"* is a careless response. The *Rites* state: *\"When the master summons, do not answer with ‘yes.’\"* *\"How close\"* means they are not distant. People fail to grasp the distinction between compliance and defiance, recklessly generating joy or anger. Hearing *\"yes\"* is deemed good, hearing *\"agree\"* provokes anger, unaware that both sounds issue from the same mouth and are not truly distant. Thus, it is said: *\"How close they are.\"*\n\nGood and evil—how different they are! What aligns with intention is good; what defies it is evil. Once compliance and defiance are seen as empty, where do good and evil reside? Moreover, *\"yes\"* and *\"agree\"* arise from one mouth, while good and evil stem from one heart. Those who forget know their indistinguishability, while those who cling are as divided as Chu and Yue. Yet those ensnared by artificial learning are many, and within the mix of right and wrong, joy and anger, *\"yes\"* and *\"agree,\"* lies the root of all suffering. This is why abandoning it brings peace—these pairs merely illustrate the need to abandon clinging to learning.\n\n**The Second Point: Do Not Dwell in the Dust of Delusion**\nWhat people fear, one must truly fear.\n\n**Commentary by the Master:**\nWhat ordinary people fear is arrogance and evil. What the virtuous fear is vulgar learning and artificial doing. All must be abandoned, hence one must truly fear them.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nWhat people fear is arrogance and evil. Arrogance leads to excess; evil invites censure.",

And yet, conventional learning and artificial pursuits only amplify distinctions of right and wrong.

If not feared, they will perish in them. Earlier, it was shown that right and wrong are both empty; yet fearing stagnation in this teaching, they fall into the dust of worldly affairs—thus this sentence is issued as a warning.\n\n第三泛列众生耽染之状。荒兮其未央哉。\n\n**The Third Point: The General Condition of Sentient Beings’ Indulgence**\nHow desolate and endless it is!\n\n御注：若不畏绝俗学，则众生正性荒废，其未有央止之时。\n\nRiver Shang Master’s Commentary: If one does not fear and abandon conventional learning, then the true nature of sentient beings will be squandered, and there will be no end to their ruin.\n\n○御疏：荒，荒废也。慢恶为过，俗学失真，是皆可畏，故当弃绝。若不绝而弃之，则正性荒废，其未有央止时。《诗》曰：夜未央，言更漏尚多也。此云其未央，言俗学伤性无息止期，故前途尚多，云未央也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"Ungoverned\" (荒) means desolation. Arrogance and evil are faults; conventional learning loses its truth—these are all things to be feared, hence they must be discarded. If they are not discarded but merely abandoned, then the true nature will be squandered, and there will be no end to its ruin. The *Book of Odes* says: *\"The night knows no end\"* (夜未央), meaning the water clock still has much time to flow. Here, \"no end\" speaks of how conventional learning harms nature without cessation, so the path ahead remains boundless.\n\n○河上公曰：世俗之人荒乱，欲学为进文，未央止也。\n\nRiver Shang Master said: The common folk are chaotic and reckless, striving to learn for advancement, yet there is no end to their striving.\n\n○成疏：荒是眇莽，叹其久远。央是尽义，嗟其未息。言众生染滞之心，其日固久，执着情笃，未有休时。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"Ungoverned\" (荒) is a state of vast confusion, lamenting its prolonged existence. \"End\" (央) signifies completion, yet it is mourned that there is no rest. The words describe how sentient beings’ minds are stained and ensnared, their days long, their attachments deep, and their restlessness without pause.\n\n众人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登台。\n\nThe masses bustle and rejoice, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meats, like ascending the spring platform in revelry.\n\n御注：众人俗学有为，熙熙逐境，如临享太牢，春台登望，动生贪欲。\n\nRiver Shang Master’s Commentary: The common folk indulge in conventional learning and artificial pursuits, their emotions stirred and desires aroused, as if they were about to feast on the grandest sacrificial meats or ascend the spring platform to gaze upon the world.\n\n○御疏：熙熙者，情欲淫动之貌。此明不畏绝俗学之人也。夫俗学有学为，动生情欲，熙熙逐境，役役终身，如馁夫之临享太牢，恣贪滋味，怡容之春台登望，动生爱着。太牢者，牛羊豕也。春台所以为爱着，谓其卉木滋荣，禽乌呜匹，阳和陶然，易淫荡也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"Bustling and rejoicing\" (熙熙) depicts the unrestrained movement of emotions and desires. This illustrates those who do not fear and abandon conventional learning. Such learning, with its artificial pursuits, stirs emotions and desires, driving them to chase after transient things, enslaving them for life. It is like a starving man before a grand sacrificial feast, greedily indulging in flavors, or a contented person ascending the spring platform to gaze upon verdant fields, where love and attachment are easily kindled. The \"grand sacrificial meats\" (太牢) refer to oxen, sheep, and pigs. The spring platform invites attachment because its lush vegetation, the harmonious calls of birds, and the gentle warmth of the season all stir unbridled passion.\n\n故《豳诗》云：春日迟迟，探蘩祁祁，女心伤悲，迨及公子同归。\n\nThus the *Book of Odes* says: *\"The spring days linger on\"* (春日迟迟), *\"the picking of wild plants is frequent\"* (探蘩祁祁), *\"the maiden’s heart is wounded with sorrow\"* (女心伤悲), *\"until the noble son returns with her\"* (迨及公子同归).\n\n○河上公曰：众人熙熙，熙熙，淫佚多情砍。如享太牢，如饥思太牢之具，意无足时也。如春登台，春阴阳交通，万物感动，登台观之，志意淫佚。\n\nRiver Shang Master said: The masses bustle and rejoice, their desires unrestrained and emotions overflowing. Like feasting on the grand sacrificial meats, they crave them as if starving, their intentions never sated. Like ascending the spring platform, where yin and yang merge and all things are stirred, they gaze upon it, their wills and desires lost in indulgence.\n\n○荣曰：熙熙，悦乐也。太牢，味也。春台，色也。言流俗众人务学以规名声，纵情以昏色味，悦之以目，不知盲之有时。适之以口，不知爽之有日。逐欲老而愈溢，劳形困而不休，仍自欣欣以为悦乐也。\n\nHonor said: \"Bustling and rejoicing\" (熙熙) is delight and pleasure. The \"grand sacrificial meats\" (太牢) are flavors; the \"spring platform\" (春台) is color. The common folk strive in learning to seek fame, indulge emotions in the murky shades of taste and color, and gratify the senses with eyes and mouths—yet they do not know that blindness has its limits or that satiety has its day. As they age in their pursuit of desires, their cravings only grow more excessive; their bodies weary yet they rest not, yet they still take pride in their endless pleasure.\n\n○成疏：言耽染者众，故云众人，即众生之别称也。熙熙，悦乐也。享，燕享也。太牢，牛羊豕也。言众生欣爱声色，情染极深，如饥人享太牢之馔，悦美色之甚，又如春日登台，眺望林野，畅适其心也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: It speaks of how many are ensnared, hence \"the masses\" (众人), another term for sentient beings. \"Bustling and rejoicing\" (熙熙) is delight and pleasure. \"Feast\" (享) means to enjoy a banquet. The \"grand sacrificial meats\" (太牢) are oxen, sheep, and pigs. The words describe how sentient beings are captivated by sounds and colors, their emotions deeply entangled—like a starving man feasting on grand sacrificial meats, or like ascending the spring platform on a spring day to gaze upon forests and fields, finding their hearts fully satisfied.\n\n第四对辨圣人之悟，以治凡鄙之迷。\n\n**The Fourth Point: Contrasting the Sage’s Awakening with the Common Folks’ Illusion**\n\n我独泊兮其未兆，若婴儿之未孩。\n\nI alone remain tranquil, my nature yet unmanifested—like an infant before its first smile.\n\n御注：我独泊然安静，於情欲略无形，如彼婴儿，未能孩孺也。\n\nRiver Shang Master’s Commentary: I alone remain tranquil and still, with no trace of emotions or desires. It is like that infant, which has not yet begun to smile and play.\n\n○御疏：我者，老君自称，言我畏绝俗学，学道含和，独能泊然安静，於彼代间有为之事，情欲等法，略无形兆。如彼婴儿，未孩笑，无分别也。孩者，别人之意。《庄子》曰：不至于孩而始谁。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"I\" (我) is the self-reference of the Old Master (老君). It states that I fear and abandon conventional learning, practice the Dao with harmony, and alone am able to remain tranquil and still. Toward the transient affairs of the world, emotions, and desires, I show no form or trace. Like that infant, I have not yet begun to smile or distinguish things. \"Infant\" (孩) refers to the mind of one who does not yet separate. *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Only when one does not reach the stage of infantile simplicity does one begin to be confused.\"*\n\n○河上公曰：我独泊兮其未兆，我独泊然安静，未有情欲之形兆也。如婴兄之未孩，如小儿未能答偶人时。\n\nRiver Shang Master said: \"I alone remain tranquil\" (我独泊兮其未兆), meaning I alone remain tranquil and still, with no trace of emotions or desires. Like a younger brother who has not yet begun to smile, or like a child who cannot yet respond to others.\n\n○荣曰：圣人言众人驰骛於有为之境，为声色之所动，我澹泊於无为之端，香味不能惑，犹如赤子未识牝牡之合，不知淫佚之情，心无所在，岂定有归也。\n\nHonor said: The Sage speaks of how the common folk rush about in the world of artificial pursuits, moved by sounds and colors. I, however, remain serene at the Dao of non-action, unaffected by fragrances or flavors—like an infant who does not yet know the union of male and female, nor the emotions of lust and indulgence. My heart is without attachment; how could it have a fixed abode?\n\n○成疏：我魄未兆，我，老君自称也。魄，寂也。兆，状。言圣人虽处俗尘，而心知寂魄，不为前境之所牵，故都无攀绿之萌状也。若婴儿未孩，魁无所归，婴儿，赤子也，孩，笑也，魁，宽大也，归，住着也。\n\nMaster Cheng’s Exegesis: \"My nature yet unmanifested\" (我魄未兆), where \"I\" (我) is the Old Master’s self-reference. \"Nature\" (魄) means stillness; \"manifested\" (兆) means form. The Sage, though dwelling in the dust of the world, knows the stillness of their nature and is not drawn by what lies before them—thus they show no trace of grasping at transient pleasures. Like an infant before its first smile, their nature is boundless and without fixed abode. An infant is a newborn child; \"smile\" (孩) refers to the first signs of joy. \"Boundless\" (魁) means vast and unrestrained; \"abode\" (归) signifies dwelling and attachment.",

In action or stillness, speech or silence, all are manifestations of the Dao.\nThis reveals the Dao one attains—neither existence nor nonexistence.\nThe Dao, as a phenomenon, is vague and indistinct.\n**Imperial Commentary:** This clarifies that the Dao followed by one of great virtue is neither existent nor nonexistent, its boundless operation defying name, hence \"vague and indistinct.\"\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This elucidates the subtle, ultimate origin as the form of things—precisely the Dao followed by one of great virtue.\nThe subtle, ultimate origin, forcibly named \"Dao.\"\nWhat is the Dao as a phenomenon? How does it move and rest in form?\nIt is said that this origin is neither existent nor nonexistent, difficult to name.\nTo call it existent, it is still and formless.\nTo call it nonexistent, it subtly persists.\nSince it is indeterminate, it is called \"vague and indistinct.\"\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao, among all things, uniquely moves in vague indistinctness.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\nNot yet knowing what the Dao is, yet virtue follows it clearly.\nThe Great Dao is profound and mysterious, too deep to comprehend.\nTo say it is nonexistent, yet it is formless unity.\nTo say it exists, yet it returns to nothingness.\nReturning to nothingness yet not nonexistent—\nspeaking of existence yet not existent—\nexistence and nonexistence are indeterminate,\nlife and death are undefined—\nhence it is called \"vague and indistinct.\"\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe Supreme Dao as a phenomenon—\nthough existent, it is nonexistent;\nthough nonexistent, it is existent.\nThough existent, it is not existent;\nthough nonexistent, it is not nonexistent.\nExistence and nonexistence are indeterminate—\nhence it is called \"vague and indistinct.\"\nSpeaking of \"things\" is to clarify that the Dao does not depart from things, nor do things depart from the Dao.\nOutside the Dao, there are no things;\noutside things, there is no Dao.\nAction is the Dao and things;\nessence is things and the Dao.\nIt also clarifies that enlightenment is the Dao and things,\ndelusion is things and the Dao.\nThe Dao and things are neither one nor different,\nyet different and one,\nneither one nor not one—\nthus things and the Dao,\none yet not one—\nneither Dao nor things,\nneither things hence one,\nnot one hence things—\nthus not one, not one.\n\n**Thirdly, this reveals the Sage’s body as the unity of the Three.**\nVague and indistinct—\nwithin it, forms appear.\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"Hu\"* means \"nonexistent.\"\n*\"Huo\"* means \"existent.\"\n*\"Zhao\"* reveals forms.\nFrom nonexistence descending into existence,\nwithin it, all forms manifest.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This clarifies the origin and its traces.\n*\"Hu\"* means \"nonexistent.\"\n*\"Huo\"* means \"existent.\"\n*\"Zhao\"* reveals forms.\nThe origin is formless, hence called *\"hu.\"*\nGeneration and transformation manifest form, hence called *\"huo.\"*\nThus, from nonexistence descending into existence,\nwithin it, all forms manifest—\nfrom origin to trace.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThough the Dao is vague and indistinct, formless,\nit alone is the pattern for all things.\n\n**○ Master Rong says:**\nWithin vague indistinctness, forms exist;\nwithin indistinctness, things exist—\nthe true reality of neither existence nor nonexistence,\nthe most profound and mysterious Dao,\nsplitting the One Origin to manifest the Three Forms,\nharmonizing the Two *qi* to generate all things.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nWithin vague indistinctness, forms exist;\nwithin indistinctness, things exist—\nwithin things exists *shen* (spirit),\nthe wondrous transformation of things is named.\nThough neither existent nor nonexistent,\nyet existent and nonexistent—\nhence it is wondrous.\nWithin forms exists the nonexistent;\nthough neither form nor color,\nyet it becomes color and form—\nhence it is *qi*.\nThe Dao manifests in varied transformations—\nthus it is neither thing nor form,\nyet thing and form.\nVague and indistinct—\nwithin it, things exist.\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n\"Things\" refers to the Dao as a phenomenon mentioned above.\nFrom existence returning to nonexistence,\nrestoring the Supreme Dao—\nhence it is said that within it, things exist.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:**\n\"Things\" refers to the subtle origin mentioned above.\nThe origin descending into generation,\nmanifesting all forms,\ncultivating nature to return to virtue—\nthen it returns to formlessness.\nFormlessness is the Dao.\nIt is said that through human cultivation of nature and return to virtue,\nnot departing from the origin,\nfrom existence returning to nonexistence,\nsubtly merging with the Supreme Dao—\nhence it is said that within it, things exist—\nspeaking of subtle things.\nThis gathers traces to return to the origin.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao’s vague indistinctness—\nwithin it, there is One,\ndirecting generation and transformation,\nestablishing substance through *qi*.\n\n**Mysterious and dark—**\nwithin it, there is essence.\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nVague indistinctness in existence and nonexistence,\nmysterious darkness beyond measure—\nthe operation of generation is exquisitely preserved.\n\n**○ Imperial

*achievements* (功) will return to them.\nLike the earth being *strong yet low* (劲下),\nwater will surely *fill and overflow* (盈).\nHence, it is said: *there are achievements*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\n*Claim* (伐) is *take* (取).\nThe *Sage*’s *virtue/power and transformation* (德化) flow and spread,\nyet does not take their own beauty—\nthus they have *achievements* (功) for all under heaven.\n\n**○ Master Yan said:**\n*Claim* (伐) is like *attacking and seizing* (攻伐).\nTo use the *anger of all under heaven* to attack all under heaven—\nthus, *Huangdi* (黄帝) could not equal their *威* (威).\nTo use the *strength of all under heaven* to wage war against all under heaven—\nthus, *Tang* and *Wu* (汤武) could not equal their *achievements* (量功).\nHence, all under heaven can be entrusted to,\nand the *feudal lords* (诸侯) can be subjects after them.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Claim* (伐) is *take* (取).\nThough they *punish and harm* (亭毒) countless beings,\nyet they *sacrifice themselves as mere straw dogs* (刍狗) to the people,\npushing merit onto others—\nthus they have *great achievements* (大功).\n\n**Not to boast—thus one endures.**\n**御注:** If one can constantly guard *privation/deficiency* (弊薄),\nnot boasting or exalting oneself,\nthen others will exalt their *enduring qualities* (长).\n\n**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields renewal* (曲则新).\nIt says that if one can guard *privation/deficiency* (弊薄),\nnot boasting or showing off,\nthen others will surely yield,\nand their *good conduct* (善行) will grow ever longer—\nhence, it is said: *thus one endures*.\n\n**○ Master He Shang said:**\n*Boast* (矜) is *great* (大).",

one to shun such tastes.*\n*Thus, this chapter is placed next,*\n*revealing the true nature of the Dao,*\n*to inspire beings to cultivate.*\n\n*Teaching and prescribing methods*\n*must first diagnose the ailment,*\n*then offer the remedy.*\n*The remedy confronts the disease—*\n*this is why the chapter follows.*\n\n*Now, this chapter unfolds in five themes:*\n*First, revealing the Dao’s true nature,*\n*transcending all form and sound;*\n*Second, clarifying its original namelessness,*\n*then establishing names through its manifestations;*\n*Third, guiding beings toward its path,*\n*returning them to their root and origin;*\n*Fourth, citing the Four Great Elements within the realm,*\n*to show beings how to align their cultivation;*\n*Fifth, illustrating the shallow’s path to depth,*\n*gradually ascending to the ultimate perfection.*\n\n---\n\n**First: Revealing the Dao’s True Nature, Transcending All Form and Sound.**\n\n*There is an Essence that coalesces without distinction,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth arise,*\n*the primordial *qi* that enfolds all things,*\n*exceeding the workings of *造化* (Creation and Transformation) in its function.*\n*Its essence is profound and still,*\n*quiet and solitary, standing alone.*\n*Though its goodness is vast,*\n*we force upon it a name—*\n*thus things are born,*\n*and we call it *Dao/Way*.*\n*At the Jade Pool’s fleeting gathering,*\n*some hear the *Huangzhu* (Yellow Bamboo) hymn,*\n*while in the *dongling* (caverns and peaks) others encounter*\n*the scent of white *mao* (grass).*\n\n*Its passing is distant,*\n*its essence is true.*\n*The Twelve Sovereigns honor the Nameless Lord,*\n*and the Five Thousand Words proclaim it as the Mother of All Things.*\n*The Dao of Nature—*\n*what need has Heaven of speech?*\n\n*There is an Essence that coalesces without distinction,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth arise.*\n*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*\n*To explain why the Dao is named,*\n*it speaks of \"an Essence.\"*\n*The Essence coalesces without distinction,*\n*encompassing all things.*\n*Tracing its transformation,*\n*one finds it precedes Heaven and Earth.*\n*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*\n*\"An Essence\" refers to the wondrous Essence,*\n*the very *虚极* (Ultimate Void) and *妙本* (Profound Origin).*\n*To further clarify why names are imposed,*\n*yet the Dao cannot be directly called,*\n*it says, \"There is this wondrous Essence.\"*\n*Coalescing without distinction,*\n*it enfolds all phenomena.*\n*Tracing its transformation,*\n*one finds it precedes Heaven and Earth—*\n*thus, it is said to exist before Heaven and Earth arise.*\n\n*[Master He Shang Gong] said:*\n*The Dao is formless, like the undifferentiated *混沌* (Chaos),*\n*yet it gives birth to all things,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth.*\n\n*[Master Li Rong] said:*\n*\"An Essence\" is the Dao.*\n*Though named *Dao/Way*,*\n*the Dao as Essence*\n*is but a fleeting glimpse,*\n*a hazy vision—*\n*it cannot be discussed in terms of presence or absence,*\n*nor distinguished by yin and yang.*\n*Coalescing without distinction,*\n*it forms all things naturally.*\n*Thus, it is called *混成* (Undifferentiated Coalescence).*\n*The Dao’s natural principle*\n*operates through transformation and change,*\n*its formless depths*\n*unfold through the *qi* of phenomena.*\n*Its origin precedes Heaven and Earth—*\n*thus, it is said to exist before their birth.*\n\n*[Master Cheng’s Commentary]:*\n*\"An Essence\" is the Dao.*\n*It clarifies that the Dao, though called \"having,\"*\n*is not truly a thing,*\n*and though called \"an Essence,\"*\n*it is not truly material.*\n*Undifferentiated yet capable of giving birth to all things,*\n*it is also said to be not mixed yet mixed,*\n*though mixed, it coalesces,*\n*though coalesced, it remains undifferentiated.*\n*Though undifferentiated, it coalesces,*\n*though coalesced, it remains undifferentiated—*\n*this is the Dao of Undifferentiated Coalescence,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth,*\n*yet neither prior nor posterior,*\n*neither giving birth nor being born.*\n*Thus, the *Zhuangzi* says:*\n*\"The Spirit Sovereign, the Ghost Sovereign,*\n*give birth to Heaven and Earth,\"*\n*and also:*\n*\"It exists before Heaven and Earth,*\n*yet is not called the Old One.\"*\n\n*Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,*\n*circulates endlessly without exhaustion,*\n*and may be called the Mother of all things.*\n\n*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*\n*The nature of \"An Essence\" is silent and vast,*\n*its profound origin ever still and tranquil.*\n*Thus, it stands alone unchanging.*\n*Its influence permeates all beings,*\n*so it circulates endlessly without peril.*\n*All things draw from it to be born and formed,*\n*receiving its nurturing and flourishing virtue—*\n*thus, it may be called the Mother of all things.*\n\n*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*\n*\"Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,\"*\n*—this sighs at the nature of \"An Essence,\"*\n*silent

beings—*\n*thus, it circulates endlessly without peril.*\n\n*\"It may be called the Mother of all things,\"*\n*—its profound origin gives birth and transforms,*\n*permeating all beings.*\n*All things under Heaven*\n*are none but its crafted forms,*\n*and all creatures receive its flourishing nurturing virtue—*\n*thus, it may rightly be called the Mother of all things.*\n*The Mother’s meaning lies in its nurturing virtue.*\n\n*[Master He Shang Gong] said:*\n*\"Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging—*\n*Silent means without sound,*\n*Vast means formless emptiness.*\n*Standing alone means without pair or equal,*\n*Unchanging means transformation has constancy.\"*\n\n*[Master Li Rong] said:*\n*The Dao of Undifferentiated Coalescence,*\n*existing before Heaven and Earth,*\n*when listened to, is inaudible—*\n*thus, it is silent and vast without echo.*\n*When grasped, it cannot be held—*\n*thus, it is formless and boundless.*\n*It lacks a counterpart,*\n*so it is said to stand alone.*\n*Ever profound and unceasing,*\n*thus, it is said to be unchanging.*\n*It is nowhere absent,*\n*thus, it circulates endlessly.*\n*Its application is without effort,*\n*thus, it is without

benevolence (惠门).\n\nOnce one can emulate Heaven (天),\none must next follow the **Dao/Way’s** (道) clarity and **Voidlessness** (虚通),\nencompassing all things.\n\nOnce one can emulate the **Dao/Way** (道),\none must next follow the **profound principles** (妙理) of **Nature** (自然),\nthe realm of the **Double Mystery** (重玄).\n\nThe **Dao/Way** (道) is the **advancement** (进),\n**Nature** (自然) is the **Root** (本),\nand by the **Root** (本) absorbing the **advancement** (迹),\nthus the meaning of \"following\" (法).\nAgain, it is explained:\nThe **Dao/Way’s** (道) inherent disposition is **Nature** (自然),\nand it follows nothing else—\nits essence transcends all cultivation and learning (体绝修学),\nhence it is said to follow **Nature** (自然).\n\n**Double Mystery** (重玄) is the **root of the light** (轻根) in Chapter Twenty-Six.\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the reason this chapter follows the previous one:\nthe previous chapter expounds how humans should follow the Earth (地),\nand demonstrates that for those who seek the **Dao/Way** (道),\nstillness is the first principle (静为先).\nHence this chapter follows,\nto weigh and measure stillness against agitation (校量静躁).\n\nWithin this chapter, there are three layers of meaning:\nFirst, it correctly distinguishes the inferiority of **lightness and agitation** (轻躁)\nand the superiority of **stillness** (静).\nSecond, it explains that one who upholds **stillness** (重静) will not act contrary to **tranquility** (寂).\nThird, it reveals that those who are **light and agitated** (轻躁) will meet ruin in state and person (亡国丧身).\n\nFirst, it correctly distinguishes the inferiority of **lightness and agitation** (轻躁) and the superiority of **stillness** (静).\nThe great **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth is **generation** (日生),\nthe great treasure of the **Sage** (圣人) is **proper rule** (日位).\nStillness governs movement (静以制动),\nas the thirty spokes revolve around the hub (三十辐之循环),\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nand the **Nine-Five Sovereign** (九五君) embodies its perfect manifestation (端委).\n\nAscending the **Great Peak** (太山) is vast and grand,\nreturning to the myriad hills (众阜) is high,\nwearing the **Jade of Perfection** (玉宸) is for rule (为君),\ngrasping the common people’s reins (握庶人之纪).\n\nThus, it is known:\nwhen the six lines are set,\nthe upper one governs the myriad forms (上一制之於群象),\nand the initial division of the eight lines (八有初分),\nthe lower five stabilize the myriad positions (下五镇之於众位).\n\nHence, the **Profound Mirror** (玄鉴) is distant and wondrous,\nonly stillness and clarity (唯静与清) can reveal it.\nThe **Yellow Palace** (黄屋) holds its august dignity,\nonly the high and the great (唯高唯大) can embody it.\nThe **Sage** (圣人) opens his principles,\nwhich can be discerned in detail.\n\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nand **stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君).\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong’s Commentary** (河上公曰):\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nso if the human ruler does not uphold **Double Mystery** (重),\nhe will not be revered (不尊).\nIf one does not uphold **Double Mystery** (重) in governing his body (治身),\nhe will lose his **spirit** (神).\nGrasses and trees have **light** (轻) flowers and leaves,\nso they wither and fall,\nbut their **roots** (重) are heavy (重),\nso they endure and persist (长存).\n\n**Stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君),\nso if the human ruler is not still (不静),\nhe will lose his **awe** (威).\nIf one does not uphold **stillness** (静) in governing his body (治身),\nhis body will be in danger (身危).\nThe **Dragon** (龙) is still, so it can transform (变),\nthe **Tiger** (虎) is agitated, so it meets early demise (夭亏).\n\n○ **Rong** (荣) says:\nBoth great and small are **light** (轻),\nyet they cannot serve as **roots** (根本).\nBoth high and low are agitated (躁),\nyet how can they serve as **lords** (君主)?\nThus, one **light** (轻) and one **heavy** (重),\nthe **light** (轻) takes the **heavy** (重) as its **root** (根).\nOne agitated (躁) and one still (静),\nthe agitated takes the still as its **master** (主).\n\nHence, those who uphold **non-action** (无为) and **heavy stillness** (重静) embody the **virtue/power** (德) of rule (为君),\nand those who uphold **action** (有为) and **light agitation** (轻躁) fulfill the duties of subjects (臣之事).\n\nThe high and low each attend to their own affairs (各司其业),\nand for the ruler (为君),\n**heavy stillness** (重静) is essential.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):\n**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),\nan analogy like a tree’s **root** (根) being **heavy** (重),\nand its flowers and leaves **light** (轻).\nThe **light** (轻) withers and falls,\nwhile the **heavy** (重) endures and persists (长存).\n\nThis warns learners not to be **light and agitated** (轻躁),\nhence the *Book of Documents* (《书》) states:\n*\"A gentleman who is not **heavy** (重) will not command **awe** (威).\"*\n\n**Stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君),\nas stillness is **non-action** (无为),\nand agitation is **desire** (有欲).\n**Desire** (有欲) brings death (生死),\n**non-action** (无为) brings endurance (长存).\nStillness can govern movement (静能制动),\nhence it is for rule (为君).\n\nSecond, it explains that one who upholds **heavy stillness** (重静)\nwill not act contrary to **tranquility** (寂).\nThus, the **gentleman** (君子) moves all day,\nyet never departs from his **burden** (辎重).»",

the earlier warning and adds new meaning.\n*\"Zhī\"* (辎) means **stillness** (静).\nIt says the sovereign, who understands humanity (达人),\nmoves through the world all day (终日行化),\nyet never abandons **heavy stillness** (重静).\nThis is the meaning of \"moving yet tranquil\" (动而寂).\nEven amid splendor (荣观),\nhe remains detached (超然).\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nThe sovereign must uphold

(荣观),\nthen the people’s strength will be exhausted,\nand chaos and ruin will follow (乱亡斯作).\nThus the warning says:\nEven amid splendor (荣观),\nhe must rest content (燕尔安处),\ndetached (超然) and far removed from such distractions (远离而不顾).\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**\n*\"Hóngguān\"* (荣观) refers to the palaces (官阙) and resting halls (燕舍)\nwhere the queen and concubines reside (后妃所居).\n*\"Chāorán\"* (超然) means to stand far away and not dwell there.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nWhat the **sage** (圣人) values is the **Great Dao/Way** (大道),\nwhat he treasures is **heavy

(万乘之主).\n*\"Nàihé\"* (奈何) is a word of lamentation (伤叹).\n*\"Tiānxià\"* (天下) refers to the supreme position (大宝之位).\nThe sovereign of ten thousand chariots must unite the four seas (四海必同),\nand ensure

It first elucidates the **Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人),\n   whose **Three Businesses** (三业) are pure and **Daoist stillness** (清净).\n2. It then reveals the **Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人)\n   as **firm and unshakable** (结显坚固),\n   with the **Six Roots** (六根) **liberated** (解脱).\n3. It next demonstrates **transcending traces and urgent rescue** (降迹激救),\n   responding to all things without omission (应物无遗).\n4. Finally, it illustrates the **Dao of teacher and disciple** (师资之道),\n   the **marvels of cultivation** (修学之妙),\n   and its **eloquence** (而言之).\n\n1. **The Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人) **whose Three Businesses are pure** (三业清净).\nThe **sage** (圣) **responds to the vast Dao** (应圆界),\nhis **heart** (心) **settled in primordial stillness** (夏心湛寂),\nyet **does not act** (不行) while **transcending** (去).\nHe wanders through the **Midst of Kunlun** (远游昆阆之中),\nyet **does not depart** (不出) while **knowing** (知).\nHe treads upon **Jiaozhen** (瑕践瑶京之上),\nthe **Daode Palace** (瑶京).\n\nIn **stillness**, yet able to **move** (寂而能动),\ndwelling in darkness yet ever **illuminated** (处暗常明),\nhe **pities** (欲) the **myriad living beings** (我苍生),\nenduring their eternal suffering in the **Nine Abysses** (九幽).\nHe **lament**s (叹) those ensnared in **evil and filth** (彼邪秽),\nlost in the **Five Desires** (五欲) **for endless ages** (长昏).\n\nLike the **venomous serpent’s head** (嗔蛇头),\neven the **wise and virtuous** (贤圣) **dare not approach**.\nLike the **drunken elephant’s trunk** (醉象首),\nthe **enlightened** (达人) **abandon it**.\nThe **common and deluded** (凡迷) **how can awaken** (从何得悟)?\nThus, **Daoist virtue** (善行) **leaves no trace** (无迹)!\nWhen **rescue** (救) is sought,\nthe **Dao of teacher and disciple** (师资之道) **is unified** (一齐),\nand the **hearts of all beings** (凡圣之心) **are extinguished** (双泯).\n\n**Daoist virtue** (善行) **leaves no trace** (无辙述).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\nWithin all **dharma** (诸法),\nrealizing the **true nature** (体了真性),\nactions manifest **no action** (行无行相),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).\n\nSo, the **heart unites with the Dao** (心与道冥),\nand **no trace or path** (辙迹) **can be sought**.\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**\nThis reveals the **pure nature of dharma** (法性清净).\n**Actions** (行) refer to **cultivation** (修行).\nWhen the **nature of dharma** (法性) is pure,\nthis is called **Triple Primordial** (重玄).\nThough one relies on **diligent practice** (勤行),\none must **avoid attachment** (无着),\n**gradually extinguishing** (次来次灭)\nuntil **actions manifest no form** (行无行相).\nThe **heart unites with the Dao** (心与道合),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).\nTo achieve this is to **equalize emptiness and unity** (空有一齐),\nwhere **phenomena and mind are both pure** (境心俱净).\nIf one seeks **traces or paths** (辙进),\nis it not **difficult** (难)?\n\n**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**\nThe **Daoist adept of virtue** (善行道者)\nseeks it **within oneself** (於身),\nnever descending from the **hall** (不下堂),\nnor stepping outside the **door** (不出门),\nthus **leaving no trace** (故无辙述).\n\n**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**\nThe **Seven-Scented Fragrance Chariot** (七香流水之车),\nwhen **moved** (动), has **traces** (有辙).\nThe **Thousand-Li Cloud-Steed** (千里浮云之马),\nwhen **leaping** (跃), has **pathways** (有述).\nYet **not hasty yet swift** (不疾而速),\n**cloud-plowing** (云耕) **does not trample the earth** (不辗地).\n**Not acting yet arriving** (不行而至),\nthe **Phoenix Bird** (凤鸟) **has no trace** (本无迹).\nThis speaks of the **sage** (圣人) **resting in the hall** (垂拱庙堂),\nyet **not following the tracks of Zhou’s kings** (不偏周王之辙),\nand the **virtuous scholar** (贤士) **fading into seclusion** (销声丘壑),\n**not diminishing the footsteps of Confucius** (不削孔丘之迹).\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**\nTo **act without action** (以无行为行),\nactions manifest **no form** (行无行相),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).\nWhen **cultivation is profound** (妙契所修),\n**phenomena and wisdom merge** (境智冥会),\nno **traces or paths** (辙迹) **are visible** (之可见),\nthis reveals the **purity of bodily conduct** (身业净).\n\n**Daoist virtue in speech** (善言) **leaves no blemish or censure** (无瑕谪).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\nOne who **comprehends the teachings** (能了言教),\nyet **does not cling rigidly** (不为滞执),\n**discards the form to seek the meaning** (遗象求意),\n**realizes the truth beyond words** (理证言忘),\nthus **speech is free from flaw or blame** (於言教中无瑕疵谪过).\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**\nThis reveals the **learned not clinging to words** (学人不滞言教).\n**Blemish** (瑕) means **defect or illness** (病).\n**Censure** (谪) means **blame** (责).\n**Speech** (言) refers to **teachings** (言教).\nWhen **Daoist virtue leaves no trace** (善行无迹),\none **comprehends the teachings** (能了言教),\nyet **does not cling rigidly** (不为执滞),\n**forgetting speech while in speech** (於言忘言),\nthis is **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言).\nThus, **discarding forms to guide meaning** (遗象导意),\n**truth illuminates speech-forgetting** (理照言忘),\nin all **teachings** (言教),\n**there is no defect or blame** (一无病责),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言无瑕谪).\n\n**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**\n**Daoist virtue in speech** (善言) **is to choose words wisely** (择言而出之),\nthus **no flaw or blame exists in the world** (无瑕疵谪过於天下).\n\n**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**\nWhen **words strike the bell** (言铃有中),\n**a thousand li respond** (千里应之),\nyet **speak only of the Dao** (非法不言),\nwhat **blame** (过) **could there be**?\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**\n**Speech without speech** (不言之言),\n**speaking yet not speaking** (言而不言),\n**all day speaking yet never truly speaking** (终日言未尝言),\n**nor truly not speaking** (亦未尝不言),\nthus it is called **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言).\nAs the *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Words sufficient to convey the Dao\nare spoken all day yet exhaust the Dao.\"* (言而足则终日言而尽道也).\n**Blemish** (瑕) means **defect or illness** (疵病).\n**Censure** (谪) means **blame** (过责).\n**Silence and speech are alike** (默语不异),\nthus **no blame for words** (无口过之责).\nThe original text uses the character **de** (的),\nreferring to the **sage’s speech** (圣人之言),\nwhich **lacks any target** (既无的当),\nthus **no blame for any direction** (故无所之谓).\nThis reveals the **purity of verbal conduct** (口业净).\n\n**Daoist virtue in thought** (善计) **requires no scheming** (无筹算).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\nOne who **comprehends all dharma** (能了诸法),\n**has no dual paths** (本无二门),\n**unifies all with one principle** (一以贯之),\n**does not generate other views** (不生他见),\nthus **no need for scheming or calculation** (故无劳筹算),\n**naturally illuminated and comprehended** (自然照了).\nWhen **thoughts manifest no thought-form** (计无计相),\nwhat is more **virtuous** (善) than this?\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**\nThis reveals **teachings not clinging** (言教无滞),\nthus **no duality in thought** (则不计异门).\nWhen one **clings to words and stagnates in actions** (执言滞行),\n**distinguishing right from wrong** (辨是与非),\neven **clever strategists** (巧历) **cannot compute**.\nYet if one **comprehends all dharma as expedient means** (能了诸法皆方便门),\n**ultimately pure and unadulterated** (究竟清净),\n**not generating other views** (不生他见),\nthen **no need for scheming or calculation** (则无劳筹策算数),\n**one can naturally penetrate the One Vehicle** (自能深入一乘).\nWhen **thoughts are thus virtuous** (善计若斯),\nwhy **labor in scheming or calculation**?\nThus it is said: **Daoist virtue in thought requires no scheming** (善计不用筹算).\n\n**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**\nThe **virtuous in thought** (善以道计事者)\n**holds to one principle without deviation** (守一不移),\n**thoughts are few** (所计不多),\n**no scheming is needed yet all is known** (不用筹策而可知者).\n\n**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**\n**Scheming and calculation** (筹策) **are for counting things** (算物数),\nbut **the Dao observes all** (以道观之),\n**nothing is left unexamined** (物无不尽),\n**the Dao transcends numbers** (道非於数),\nso why use **scheming and calculation**?\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**\n**Mysterious comprehension** (妙悟) **of all dharma as one** (诸法同一虚假),\n**not setting up falsehoods** (不设虚假),\n**falsehoods reveal truth** (即假体真),\n**no need for calculation** (无劳算计),\n**suddenly illuminated and clear** (划然明了),\nthis reveals the **purity of mental conduct** (意业净).\n\n2. **Revealing the firm and unshakable vow** (结愿坚固), **and the liberation of the Six Roots** (六根解脱).\n**Daoist virtue in closing** (善闭) **has no bolts or bars** (无关梃) **yet cannot be opened** (而不可开).\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**\n**Both speech and action are forgotten** (兼忘言行),\n**not entering false paths** (不入异门),\n**the heart does not wander in phenomena** (心无逐境之迷),\n**phenomena do not burden the heart** (境无起心之累),\nthough **no bolts or bars** (虽无关楗),\nhow could it be **opened**? (其可开乎?)\n\n**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**\nThis reveals **not clinging to false paths** (不计异门),\nthus **the desire-heart naturally closes** (则欲心自闭).\n**Horizontal bars are called \"guān\"** (横日关),\n**vertical bars are called \"jiàn\"** (竖日楗).」",

Once engaged in form and vessel (形器), there must be both refined and coarse (精赢), hence the Sage employs them and they become **officials and leaders of the masses** (群村之官长).\n\n○ The Imperial Exegesis: **Vessels** (器) are **forms and vessels** (形器). From **knowing the masculine** (知雄) to **guarding shame** (守辱), through cultivation of nature and return to **virtue/power** (德), it again returns to the **Dao/Way** (道). Here, when it says **simplicity disperses to become vessels** (朴散则为器), it clarifies that when **virtue/power** (德) is fully unified with the **Dao/Way** (道), it can respond and apply itself. When application becomes coarse (迹粗), it involves **forms and vessels** (形器), hence it says **simplicity disperses to become vessels** (朴散则为器). Once engaged in form and vessel, the **masses’** (村) usage will have refined and coarse (精粗), thus ordinary people employing them can only preserve their own **purity and simplicity** (淳朴), while the Sage’s broad salvation becomes **officials and leaders of the masses** (群村之官长).\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong (河上公) said: When **simplicity** (朴) disperses, it becomes **vessels** (器). The **simplicity** (朴) of all things disperses to become **vessels and their uses** (器用). If the **Dao/Way** (道) disperses, it becomes **spiritual luminosity** (神明), flowing as the **sun and moon** (日月), dividing into the **Five Phases** (五行). The Sage employs them and they become **officials and leaders** (官长); when the Sage applies them externally, they become the **original leaders of all officials** (百官之元长).\n\n○ Rong (荣) said: When **the seed** (种) disperses, it becomes **vessels** (器). The Sage uses them as **officials and leaders** (官长), hence the great measure is without harm (割). Before **qi** (气) is divided, it is **the seed** (种). When the three **kinds of virtue/power** (三种) have positions, they are **vessels** (器). From the **formless** (无形) to opening **manifest forms** (有象), hence it speaks of **dispersing simplicity to become vessels** (散朴以为器). The **noble** (尊) and **humble** (卑) nature of Heaven and Earth being established, the **noble** (贵) and **humble** (贱) nature of ruler and subject is also clear. It is set as ruler, hence it says **officials and leaders** (官长). Governing all under Heaven, hence it speaks of **great measure** (大制). The **high** (上) can nurture and give life (字育), the **low** (下) can receive without harm (不伤), hence it says **without harm** (无割). This also clarifies the Sage’s opening of the **teachings of the unsaid** (不言之教), which is the same as **dispersing simplicity to become vessels** (散朴为器).\n\n□ The true **Immortal Adepts** (真仙) are the **officials and leaders** (官长). They employ the **Dao/Way** (道) to govern all things, and all things return to them—this is the **great measure** (大制).

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Chapter on \"Those Who Would Take the Realm\"**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior expounds on **forgetting merit and utility for things**, becoming a **sovereign and artisan** for the realm. Thus, this chapter reveals the **arts of governing the realm and body while benefiting things**.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:\n1. It first clarifies that **desire and action** ruin the body and destroy the realm.\n2. It then presents the **manifestations of action**, demonstrating that all **phenomena are impermanent**.\n3. Finally, it contrasts the **Sage**, who **mysteriously transcends attachment**.\n\n**1. Clarifying that desire and action ruin the body and destroy the realm**\n\nA **Dao-governed ruler** is a **non-acting sovereign**. To **take the realm**, one must **align with the times and respond to the people**. Thus, **King Wu of Zhou** overthrew Shang, and the **white banner hung from King Zhou’s head**; **Xiang Yu** ruled Han, and the **Red Emperor perished at his hands**.\n\nYet those who **do not know the coming of Heaven’s Mandate** and **arrogantly stir up ambition** are warned in the *Treatise on Fate*: *\"Dragons, rhinos, and sun-horned beasts are signs of imperial rule; river-eyes and tortoise markings are signs of noble rank.\"* Is this not so?\n\nThe **High Ancestor** (Han Gaozu) **yielded and ascended** to power, while **Qin Shihuang** **brutally seized it** and saw his line **decline**. I see that those who **take the realm by force** cannot **sustain it**. Is this not the truth?\n\n*\"Those who would take the realm and do so—*\nI see that they **cannot achieve their ends**.\"*\n\n**Emperor’s Annotation:** *\"The realm\"* refers to the **precious position of sovereignty**. A ruler must **await the Mandate’s arrival**—if a **violent usurper** seeks to **seize it by force**, it will not endure.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:** *\"The realm\"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**. Heaven **commands emperors** and **governs all living beings**—this must await the **Mandate’s arrival** before one **rules over all**. Yet **wicked rebels** and **violent men**, who **seek to seize the realm by force**, will be **exterminated before they can even hope for Heaven’s blessings**. Thus, the **Daoist Master warns**: *\"I see that such men **cannot achieve their ends**.\"* *\"Already\"* is a **particle of emphasis**.\n\n**River Upper Master (河上公) says:** *\"Those who would take the realm\"*—meaning they **aspire to be sovereign**. *\"And do so\"*—meaning they **rule through action**. *\"I see that they **cannot achieve their ends**\"*—because **Heaven’s Way abhors turmoil and impurity**, and **human hearts abhor excessive desire**.\n\n**Yan (严) says:** *\"The realm\"* is what **spiritual essences** create and **Great Harmony** fulfills—**spiritual essences perceive it**, and even **sages cannot fully grasp it**; **force cannot control it**.\n\n**Li (李) says:** *\"Non-action and non-doing\"* can **govern the realm**. If one **acts and does**, I see that they **cannot achieve their ends**.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"Those who would seize the realm and its people as sovereigns\"* must **empty their hearts and abandon desire**. If they **seize it through action**, their **failure is already evident**.\n\n*\"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**.*\n*Those who force it—**ruin it**.\"*\n\n**Emperor’s Annotation:** *\"The realm\"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**, a **divine instrument of Heaven and Earth**—thus, it **cannot be seized by force**. Hence, *\"Those who force it—ruin it\"*—this warns **wicked and rebellious ministers**.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:** *\"The realm\"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**, which **cannot be seized by force**—for it is a **divine instrument** meant for **eternal sages** who **spread benevolent transformations**, ensuring that **violent men do not poison the realm with their schemes**. Thus, it is **known that it cannot be forced**, and if forced, it **will surely fail**. This warns **wicked and rebellious ministers**.\n\n**River Upper Master says:** *\"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**.\"* *\"Instrument\"* means **thing**—**humanity is the divine thing of the realm**. Divine things **love tranquility** and **cannot be governed by action**. *\"Those who force it—ruin it\"*—because **governing through action corrupts their innate purity**.\n\n**Li (李) says:** If one **promotes the realm’s goodness without claiming its rewards**, **removes the realm’s harms without taking credit**, and **allows all to drink the harmony of virtue**, then **all things follow transformation in joy**, and one **can securely hold the precious position and guard the divine instrument**. But if one **does not know the error of action** and **clings to it**, then **ruin and loss are certain**.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**.\"* All **sentient beings** possess **spiritual essences** and **can receive the Dao**—thus, it is called a **divine instrument**. The **divine instrument** is also the **imperial position**. If one **governs with non-action and tranquility**, all things **prosper in harmony**; but if one **disturbs with action**, all living beings **lose their nature**—thus, it **cannot be forced**. *\"Those who force it—ruin it\"*—**clinging to action leads to ruin and death**; **fixating on desires causes loss of realm and state*. *\"Those who cling—lose it.\"*\n\n**Emperor’s Annotation:** *\"The Mandate rests upon them\"*—they have already **obtained sovereignty**, yet they **cling to this position**, **oppressing the divine sovereign**. Heaven’s **retribution will cause them to lose it**—this warns **emperors**.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:** A **ruler** may either **restore order from chaos** or **preserve the ancestral path**. All must **display virtue and block transgressions**, **relieve the hidden and seek the crippled**. But if they **cling to this position**, **oppressing the divine sovereign**, they **bring disorder without form**, causing **Heaven’s retribution to punish the wicked and bless the virtuous**, **divine wrath and human anger to arise**, **disasters to multiply**, and **chaos to ensue**. Who would **obey such a ruler**? They will **surely lose their position**. This warns **emperors**.",

Hence, things may **move ahead**, **follow behind**, **warm by exhalation**, **chill by inhalation**, **strengthen when supported**, **weaken when suppressed**, **succeed when guided by Dao**, or **collapse from lack of virtue**.\n\n**Emperor’s Commentary:**\nThis illustrates that all things are **not constant**, and affairs **rise and fall in turn**.\n**Exhalation (mǘ)**—warm *qi*.\n**Inhalation (chuī)**—cold *qi*.\n**Weak (yíng)**—feeble.\n**Uphold (zài)**—to **manage affairs**.\n**Collapse (huī)**—to **ruin**.\n\nMoreover, **action leads to ruin**; **clinging leads to loss**. Just as all things **move ahead or follow behind**, **warm or chill**, **strengthen when supported or weaken when suppressed**, **uphold affairs or push toward ruin**—like **red and black threads**, they cannot be measured by a single standard. Only by **aligning with natural inclination** can one **endlessly promote without exhaustion**.\n\n**River Master says:**\nThus, things **move or follow**—what the **sovereign leads**, the **subjects must follow**.\n**Exhale or inhale**—**exhale** is **warmth**; **inhale** is **cold**.\nWhere there is **warmth**, there must be **cold**.\n**Strengthen or weaken**—where there is **strength**, there must be **weakness**.\n**Uphold or collapse**—**uphold** is **stability**; **collapse** is **peril**.\nWhere there is **stability**, there must be **peril**.\nThis teaches that **rulers must not act**; governing a **state and the body** alike requires **non-action**.\n\n**Honor (Rong) says:**\nThe **laws of action** have what may be **done ahead** or **followed behind**, **one warmth and one cold**, **one flourishing and one decline**.\n**Gathered, they cohere**;

**or** means **indeterminate**.\n**Move**—**proceeds by itself**; **follow**—**conforms to others**.\nThis shows that **power and influence are unstable**.\n**Exhale or inhale**—**exhale** (*mǘ-xī*) symbolizes **warmth** (*riches and nobility*); **inhale** (*chuī-qì*) symbolizes **cold** (*poverty and lowliness*).\nThings may **first be noble then humble**, **first rich then poor**—\nlike **scarlet summer’s brilliance** or **dark winter’s chill**,\n**Heaven’s heat and cold are unstable**, so too are **human fortunes**.\n**Strengthen or collapse**—**what flourishes must decline**.\nThus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: **\"The flourishing must decay.\"**\nThis shows that **flourishing and decline are unstable**.\n**Uphold or collapse**—**uphold** is **continuity**; **collapse** is **ruin**.\n**Continuity is success**; **ruin is failure**.\nThis proves that **safety and peril are unstable**.\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says:\n**\"Its completion is its ruin.\"**\nThese **eight unstable laws** demonstrate that **all phenomena are impermanent**.\nTherefore, those who **govern states or cultivate the self** must **not cling to action or rigid control**.\n\n---\n**Third Principle: Responding to the Seated Sage**—**masterfully abandoning attachment**.\n\nThus, the **Sage eliminates excess**, **eliminates extravagance**, **eliminates excessiveness**.\n\n**Emperor’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage observes how things **move or follow**, knowing that **clinging leads to loss**, so they **avoid extremes**.\n\n**Emperor’s Commentary:**\nTherefore, the **Sage who governs the world**—\nseeing that **movement and following are impermanent**—\nknows that **arrogance and clinging must fail**.\nThus, they **restrain themselves**, **examine their conduct**, **cut greed**, and **control desires**.\nThey **reject excessive action**, **reject lavish adornment**, and **reject excessive indulgence**.\nExamining their **names and principles**, they are divided into **three categories**.\nYet their **practical effect** aligns with **one principle**.\n**Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness**—all are **transgressions**.\n\n**River Master says:**\n**Excess** refers to **lust for sounds and colors**,\n**Extravagance** refers to **garments, food, and drink**,\n**Excessiveness** refers to **palaces and pavilions**.\nAbandoning these three, one **dwells in moderation**, **acts without action**—\nthen the **world transforms itself**.\n\n**Yan (Yan) says:**\n**Excess** is **action**;

(御疏):**\n*Shī* (師), here means the ruler’s counselor,\nYet also the *Yì* (易, *I Ching*) says: *Shī* (師), means the multitude.\nWhen armies are raised and the people mobilized,\nMen are weary from service,\nAnd those who march and those who send them off hinder agricultural labor—\nThus thorns and brambles arise.\n\nAfter great armies return,\nAccumulated expenses are vast,\nAnd if the *héqì* (和氣, harmonious qi) brings blessings,\nWeapons still inflict harm, drought and flood follow in succession—\nHarvests fail, and so there will surely be years of famine and disaster,\nTo repay the grudges of relentless warfare.\n\n**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**\nWhere the military strategist stays, thorns and brambles arise—\nFarming is neglected, and fields are left uncultivated.\nAfter great armies return,\nThere will surely be years of famine,\nAs Heaven responds with malevolent *qì* (氣), harming the five grains—\nAnd when the five grains perish, people suffer.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nAfter great armies return,\nThere are surely years of famine,\nAnd fine crops cannot be planted—\nThus thorns and brambles arise,\nThis is also the fault of excessive warfare.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**\n*Shī* (師), here means the assembled forces.\nWhere soldiers and horses pass,\nThey harm both people and things—\nOnly thorns and brambles grow, no grain.\nIt is like the unrestrained *yùxīn* (欲心, craving mind) wandering where it will—\nOnly evil deeds multiply, no virtuous blessings arise.\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\nThey dare not rely on force to prevail.\nResolute yet not arrogant,\nResolute yet not boastful,\nResolute yet not proud,\nResolute only when unavoidable.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nThe virtuous counselor is resolute in halting the enemy—\nThis lies in calming the people and harmonizing the multitude,\nAnd they dare not seek victory or rely on force.\nThus, though resolute in stopping the enemy,\nThe enemy does not become a marauder.\nBe cautious not to boast of achievements or claim credit,\nLest you become filled with arrogance and pride,\nHence it is a profound warning.\n\n**Commentary of the Imperial Scholar (御疏):**\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\nThey dare not rely on force to prevail.\nThe *Chūnqiū* (春秋, *Spring and Autumn Annals*) states:\n*“Killing the enemy is resolute,”*\nYet now it is clear that the enemy-killer\nCommands them not to invade each other,\nBut to stop their violence.\nThus Laozi (老君) says:\n*“All actions should be unavoidable,\nAnd those who must use arms\nShould only seek to stop the enemy,\nPreventing them from becoming marauders,\nAnd should not use the many to oppress the few,\nNor invade others for the sake of force.”*\nTheir deeds invite withdrawal and retribution—\nHence the warning: *“They dare not rely on force to prevail.”*\nResolute yet not arrogant,\nResolute yet not boastful,\nResolute yet not proud—\nThe virtue of warfare lies in resolutely stopping the enemy.\nStopping the enemy out of arrogance is not true victory,\nHence, though able to stop the enemy,\nBe cautious not to boast.\nBoasting leads to reckless taking of credit,\nHence, though resolute in stopping the enemy,\nThe warning states: *“Do not claim credit for their deeds.”*\nIf one must claim credit for their deeds,\nThen they become arrogant and overconfident.\nArrogance leads to delight in killing,\nAnd defeat comes swiftly—\nThis is a clear warning, how could one not be cautious!\n\n**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**\nThus the virtuous are

humility, not boast of their own greatness.\nResolute yet not boastful—\nThey should be resolute in yielding, not claim credit for their achievements.\n*Páo* (骄), means to *overbear or deceive*—\nThey should be resolute in not overbearing or deceiving others.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nThus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—\nThey do not rely on force, yet use it for virtue,\nAnd stopping the enemy is their resoluteness.\nWhen bandits invade us,\nWe remove them—\nThis is not an endorsement of exclusive military might.\nResolute yet not arrogant,\nResolute yet not boastful,\nResolute yet not proud,\nResolute only when unavoidable—\nArrogance is self-aggrandizement,\nClaiming credit is self-praise,\nUnending desire for victory is *fèn* (忿, resentment),\nAnd showing superiority to the enemy is *jiāo* (骄, pride).\nHence it is said:\n*“Righteous armies reign, responding armies triumph,\nResentful armies perish, proud armies are annihilated.”*\nThe virtuous

not by choice—\nThey should be resolute in sincerity, not in being forced.\nThis is resolute yet not forceful—\nThey should be resolute in not relying on strong armies or formidable armor to overbear others.\n\n**Master Róng (荣) says:**\nIf one is firmly determined not to be haughty or arrogant,\nAnd acts only when unavoidable,\nThis is resolute yet not forceful.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**\nResolute yet not by choice—\nLike Yáo (尧) attacking the Mǐáo (有苗),\nAnd Yǔ (禹) attacking the Xù (有扈),\nThese were unavoidable actions, not a delight in arms.\nThis is resolute yet not forceful—\nThe first two lines establish that one must firmly decide not to use force.\nThirdly, it clarifies that deliberate actions contrary to the Dao\nWill surely lead to peril and destruction.\n\nWhen things reach their peak of vigor, they grow old—\nThis is called *bùdào* (不道, contrary to the Dao),\nAnd contrary to the Dao is early ruin.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\nWhen things are overused in their vigor,\nIt is due to relying on force in arms.\nWhen things are overused, they decline—\nWhen armies are too strong, they meet defeat,\nThis is contrary to

in their vigor—\nTheir vigor only hastens decline,\nAnd strength in arms cannot fully ensure victory.\nThese two matters are called contrary to the Dao.\nWise ministers and enlightened

Dao.\nThe Dao can be perpetually practiced,\nBut what is contrary to the Dao must be stopped early.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**\nThings grow old when vigorous—\nHeat at its extreme turns to cold—\nThis is the natural order.\nThings grow old when vigorous—\nThis meaning is inevitable.\nCalled contrary to the Dao,\nContrary to the Dao is early ruin—\nThings grow old when vigorous,\nArmies grow weak when strong,\nFor they lack humility and gentleness,\nThus not the true Dao—\nHence, they must be halted and not pursued.\n\n---\n**Chapter 31: The Chapter on Excellent Arms (佳兵章)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nFor though the prior chapter expounds on ceasing arms and practicing the Dao,\nIts meaning regarding the Dao’s application remains incomplete.\nThus, this chapter clarifies:\nWhen rectifying the times through the Dao,\nOne must rely on both *quan* (权, expedient means) and *shi* (实, true principle).\n\nThis chapter unfolds in four distinctions:\nFirst, it clarifies that though armies may seek strength,\nThe Dao forbids such actions.\nSecond, it reveals how things respond to the times,\nAnd the superiority or inferiority of the two intelligences (*quan* and *shi*).\nThird, it shows that *quan* does not abandon *shi*,\nAnd action does not depart from truth.\nFourth, it broadly outlines military laws,\nTo demonstrate the superiority of *shi*-intelligence.\n\n**First: Though armies may seek strength, the Dao forbids it.**\nHeaven’s Dao aids what is natural—\nTo oppose it brings misfortune.\nHuman affairs require tranquility—\nDisturbance brings calamity.\nIn the age of the Three Sovereigns,\nPure transformation abandoned arms.\nIn the age of the Five Emperors,\nCeremonial deference discarded warfare.\nFrom then onward, ruthless ambition arose—\nThus, Bai Qi led armies, deceitfully burying Zhao’s soldiers alive,\nAnd Tian Dan commanded troops, crushing Yan’s city.\nThey could not harmonize with humanity,\nNor adapt to the times—\nTheir evil spread through generations,\nYet they sought personal security.\nHow could they know the Old Master’s hatred of cruel weapons?\nStanding alone, self-guarded,\nSilent on the left, he issued clear warnings to all,\nCommanding them to avoid cruel weapons,\nAnd thus earned great virtue!\nWhy resort to killing?\n\nExcellent arms are instruments of ill omen.\nThings naturally abhor them—\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\n\n**Commentary of the Master (御注):**\n*\"Excellent\"* means *\"good.\"*\n*\"Arms\"* refers to *\"strategic schemes.\"*\nAll who cultivate speech and establish sincerity,\nUnable to conceal their virtue with morality,\nInstead take pride in military schemes and tactics—\nFor these schemes rely on conquest, slaughter, and destruction,\nMaking them instruments of evil.\nEven things naturally abhor them—\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not involve themselves in such matters.\n\n**Commentary of the

are *\"evil tools.\"*\nThe virtuous cultivate virtue and refine their conduct,\nMust be cautious from the start,\nConcealing their abilities within,\nActing only when the time is right,\nTheir minds wandering through the realms of morality,\nTheir thoughts exploring the forests of ancient wisdom,\nSo their brilliance shines and their deeds prosper.\nYet some take pride in military schemes and tactics as excellence.\nFor strategic schemes rely on deception—\n*\"The Book of Changes\"* says, *\"Oddness is the basis of the extraordinary,\"*\nAnd military writings emphasize *\"striking first in sound, second in action,\"*\nAll centered on conquest, slaughter, and destruction—\nThus, they are evil tools.\nThings naturally abhor them—\nHence, those who follow the Dao do not involve themselves in such matters.\nTo cultivate virtue in oneself is the true endeavor.\nSince these are instruments of ill omen,\nEven things naturally abhor them—\nHow much more would the virtuous avoid them?\nThus, *\"those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\"*\n\n**River Above Master (河上公) said:**\nExcellent arms are instruments of ill omen—\n*\"Ill omen\"* means *\"not good.\"*\nArms disturb the spirit and muddy the harmonious *qi*—\nThey are not tools for the virtuous and should not be adorned.\nThings naturally abhor them—\nFor whenever arms are used, harm ensues,\nThus, all things abhor them.\nHence,

good.\"*\nArms, when used, bring ruin to states and loss of lives—\nThus, they are called *\"not good.\"*\nLife is what people cherish,\nDeath is what things abhor—\nDeath is what things abhor,\nThus,

(成疏):\nThose who possess the virtue of a ruler are called *junzi* (君子).\nThe left field is auspicious, favoring life and prosperity.\nThe right field is ominous, favoring death and severity.\nIt says that in times of peace, the *junzi* prizes the left and uses *wen* (文),\nwhile in chaotic times, they prize the right and use *wu* (武).\nThis illustrates that true wisdom values longevity,\nwhile expedient wisdom acts at times with severity—\nthus the *Sutra on Guiding Sentient Beings* (度人经) says:\n\"Thousands upon thousands behead, tens of thousands dismember.\"\nArms are an ill-omened

      "translated_text": "「○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:\nIf one finds beauty in victory,\nthey will delight in killing.\nIf one finds beauty in fine arms,\nthen they love to wield the sword and spear.\n\nTo delight in killing—\nthis is what all under heaven detest.\nWith many slain in battle,\nthey cannot achieve their true ambitions.\n\nThe fourth passage broadly cites military laws\nto illustrate the Daoist principle of **real wisdom’s victory**—\nauspicious matters are placed on the left,\ninauspicious matters on the right.\nThe **Viceroy-General** stands on the left,\nthe **Supreme-General** on the right.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nThe Viceroy-General is of lower rank,\nplaced on the left because they do not hold sole authority over killing.\nThe Supreme-General’s exalted status\nplaces them on the right, as they command military strategy.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nAuspicious matters are placed on the left,\ninaspicious matters on the right—\nthe left embodies the **Yang Principle**, the source of life, hence auspicious.\nThe right embodies the **Yin Principle**, the path of killing, hence inauspicious.\n*The Record of Rites (Liji) – Tan Gong* states:\nWhen the Master stood with his disciples,\nhe bowed and took the rightmost position.\nThe disciples also took the rightmost position.\nThe Master said:\n“My disciples’ zeal for learning\nis but as my sorrow for my sister’s death.”\nThe disciples then took the leftmost position.\n\nThe Viceroy-General stands on the left,\nthe Supreme-General on the right—\nthis is to liken military command to funeral rites.\nThe Supreme-General, placed on the right,\nholds sole authority over killing,\nwhile the Viceroy-General, as deputy,\ndoes not command life and death,\nthus standing on the left.\n\nNow, the left is exalted,\nthe right is lowly—\nthe Supreme-General, though now placed on the right,\nis likened to the funeral rites’ position,\nfor though they command killing,\nthey are treated with the solemnity of death.\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe left is the auspicious position,\nthe right is the funeral position.\nNow, the Viceroy-General, of lesser rank,\nstands on the left,\nwhile the Supreme-General,\nof greater rank, stands on the right—\nthis is to clarify that even if they command killing,\nthey are placed with the rites of death and mourning.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe funeral rites place the position on the right,\nand now the Supreme-General stands on the right—\nthis is to liken them to the rites of death.\nThe departed are honored with **Yin**,\nand killing many in battle\nis met with tears of sorrow and lamentation.\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nBecause life is precious yet must be sacrificed in war,\nthere is a compassionate and benevolent heart\nthat mourns the loss,\nand this is fitting.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nTo wage war and seek victory\nmust inevitably bring many deaths.\nVictory is not beautiful,\nso the Supreme-General mourns in sorrow and lamentation.\nThe people are the foundation of the state—\nif they are secure, the state is at peace.\nNow, in battle, many are slain,\nso the benevolent heart feels sorrow and pity,\nand this is indeed appropriate.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThis reflects the fear that one’s own **virtue/power** is thin,\nunable to transform the people through the Dao,\nand thus harming the innocent.\n\n○ **Master Rong’s Commentary:**\nThe purpose of arms is to uphold justice\nand rescue the people.\nTo mourn is to lament their straying from the Dao,\nto sorrow is to regret the harm done.\nIn ancient times, the use of arms was guided by **compassion (慈)**,\nand military affairs were valued by **virtue/power (德)**,\nnot by weapons alone.\nAfter defeating the enemy,\nthe Supreme-General wore plain attire\nand took charge of the funeral rites,\naccepting condolences as part of the ceremony.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nWherever arms are used,\nslaughter and harm abound.\nThus the Supreme-General mourns,\npitying the loss of life,\nfearing that the Dao was not followed\nand that the innocent may be harmed.\n\nVictory in battle is treated with funeral rites—\nthe Supreme-General, though placed on the right,\nis likened to the rites of death.\nThe right is exalted for the living,\nyet now the Supreme-General stands on the right—\nthis is because war is an **unauspicious instrument**,\nso they are honored with mourning attire,\nthough it is not truly a funeral rite.\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nWhen a warrior gains victory in battle,\nthey receive their title and stand on the right—\na position not auspicious,\nhence it is likened to funeral rites.\nBut war is merely an **unauspicious instrument**,\nso why must they don mourning robes\nand use a staff of office\nbefore it can be called funeral rites?\nAll commentaries on this meaning\nclaim that such a custom existed in antiquity,\nbut upon examining the ancient texts,\nthere is no evidence to support it.\nThe present interpretation is unsettling,\nso it is omitted.\n\nAgain, citing the case of Qin Bo weeping before his defeated teacher—\nthis was lamentation for defeat,\nnot for victory in battle.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nIn ancient times,\nwhen victory was achieved,\nthe Supreme-General would take the funeral master’s position,\nwearing plain attire and mourning,\nto show that the **gentleman values virtue/power (德) over arms (兵)**,\nand killing is only done when unavoidable.\nTheir reluctance toward killing\nis likened to the sorrow of mourning.\n\nKnowing that later ages would not cease from using arms,\nthey mourned in sorrow and grief.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe **gentleman** and the **good person** value the use of the Dao.\nWhen forced to resort to arms,\nthey do so only out of necessity.\nThough they may defeat the enemy,\nthey do not take it as a good thing,\nso they wear plain attire and mourn,\nand still observe funeral rites in burial.\n\nThough their martial prowess surpasses their literary skill,\nthis shows that **strategic expedience (权)** is inferior to **true wisdom (实)**.\nIn governing the state,\none must resort to arms when necessary,\nand to **strategic expedience** when unavoidable.\nBy this measure,\nit is clear that **strategic expedience is weaker than true wisdom**,\nand that **martial force is lesser than virtue/power**.\n\n**End of the *Zhuangzi* – *Xuan De* (玄德) Commentary, Volume Eight.**\n**Begin of the *Zhuangzi* – *Xuan De* (玄德) Commentary,

This chapter demonstrates that if a sovereign and king upholds the Dao, then all things will naturally submit to them.\n\nThis chapter is divided into four parts within itself:\nThe first marks the \"Nameless One\" to elucidate the Dao,\nthe second cites the sovereign who upholds the Dao and thereby attracts blessings,\nthe third introduces the creation of named things and expands their applications,\nand the fourth concludes with the Dao descending to the \"Nameless One.\"\n\n**First: Marking the \"Nameless One\" to Elucidate the Dao.**\n\nThe most profound Dao, the true essence of the Way,\nis the precious *Zhenjing* of the Supreme Official.\nIts source is unfathomable, its nature serene and undisturbed—\nlength and brevity are equalized,\nso that the morning mushroom and the ancient tree share the same lifespan;\nfoolishness and wisdom are unified,\nso that the mythical *Tao* and *Liang* creatures merge into the dual *Zhuang* and *Yuan*.\n\nFrom the root to the branches, all distinctions dissolve,\nunified in speech yet divided in form,\nencompassing all phenomena yet returning to the True.\nAcross the three lives, purity is complete—\nnames vanish, dust and hues dissolve,\nand the transformation manifests:\nthe white deer appears at *Ren’an*,\nthe purple cakes descend to *Yinzǔ*.\nIts application is present,\nyet its name remains ever without—\nwhen sovereigns and kings uphold it,\nthe *Xianzhang* trees flourish like sweet dew,\nand the *Lieshi* naturally incline toward it,\ntheir ears cooled by the breeze of *Chengfeng*,\nthe Great Harmony without name—\ntruly, there is good reason for this.\n\n**Dao Constantly Without Name,**\nthough *Pu* is small,\nthe world dares not treat it as a subject.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*: The Dao is constant in its application;\nthis constancy can respond to all things,\nand its responses are not singular,\nhence \"constant without name.\"\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: Its application is inexhaustible,\nadapting only to what is sensed—\nthis is the Dao’s constancy.\nThe constancy lies in its application,\nyet its responses are not singular,\nhence \"constant without name,\"\nand thus it is said: *Dao Constantly Without Name*.\n\n*Master He Shang* says: The Great Dao can be both yin and yang,\ncan contract and expand,\ncan be vast or minute,\ncan preserve or vanish—\nhence it has no constant name.\n\n*Pu* is the wondrous origin.\n\nWhen speaking of its universal generation, it is called *Dao Yi* (One Dao);\nwhen discussing its refined unity, it is called *Pu*.\nThe wondrous origin, refined and singular,\nthus remains tranquil yet responsive in application.\n\nThe craftsman completes all universal generation—\nthis is the utmost greatness.\nHence, none dare treat the Dao as a subject.\n\n*Lord Rong* says: All named things are universally without constancy;\nyet now it is said to return to the constant Dao.\n*Pu* is the origin; *chén* (subject) is the lowly.\nThe constant Dao is the wondrous origin—\nneither great nor small,\nthough great, it cannot be prized,\nthough small, it cannot be belittled.\nIf sovereigns and kings uphold it,\nall things will naturally submit.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*: If sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,\nrefined and singular,\nacting without action,\nthen all things will naturally submit and serve them.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: It speaks that if sovereigns and kings embrace and uphold\nthe wondrous origin, refined and singular,\nacting without action or affairs,\nthen the eight extremes will look upward in transformation,\nthe four seas will return to virtue,\nand all will bathe in virtue and drink in harmony,\nnaturally submitting and serving.\n\n**Second: Citing the Upholding of the Dao and the Attraction of Auspicious Blessings.**\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite,\nthey descend sweet dew—\nnone commands it, yet it naturally equalizes.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: When sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,\nbringing about harmony,\nthere will be no calamities of drought or sandstorms,\nthe earth will be level and Heaven complete,\nthe two *qi* blending in equilibrium,\nuniting to descend sweet dew—\nauspicious blessings will naturally manifest for the sovereigns and kings.\n\n*Master He Shang* says: *Fa Tong* also says:\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite,\nit refers to the ruler upholding *Dao De*,\nuniting with Heaven and Earth,\nharmonizing *qi* so that it flows smoothly,\nauspicious blessings naturally descending—\nnone commands, yet transformation naturally equalizes.\n\nSweet dew is the fluid of harmonized *qi*.\n\n**Third: The Beginning of Creation and the Expansion of Its Applications.**\n\nThe creation of named things begins—\nonce names have been established,...",

      "translated_text": "The myriad phenomena are empty—\nwhat external defilement could cling to sounds and colors?\nInner and outer purity and stillness—\nthus it is called *明 (míng)*.\n\nAll things and self are unified—\nthus it is called *智 (zhi)*.\n\nAccording to the *Nanhua Jing* [Southern Flower Scripture]:\nThe Yellow Emperor wandered in the north of the Red River,\nascended Kunlun’s heights,\nand gazing southward, returned—\nhe lost his *玄珠 (xuán zhū)* [Mysterious Pearl].\nHe sent *智 (Zhì)* to seek it, but he could not find it;\nhe sent *离朱 (Lí Zhū)* to seek it, but he could not find it;\nhe sent *契诟 (Qì Gòu)* to seek it, but he could not find it—\nthen he sent *象罔 (Xiàng Wǎng)*.\n\n*象罔 (Xiàng Wǎng)* obtained it,\nand the Yellow Emperor said:\n“Strange! *象罔* alone could retrieve it.”\nIf one employs worldly cleverness and discrimination,\nseeking to distinguish right from wrong,\nand desires to trace the origin of the Dao—\nthis has never been heard of.\nOnly by extinguishing *智 (zhi)* can one grasp the true meaning.\n\nThus the Scripture says:\n*“Not to enlighten the people,\nbut to let them remain in their simplicity*—\nthis is its intent.”\n\n---\n\n**Second: Clarity in Self-Mastery**\nSelf-mastery preserves one’s strength.\nHe who overcomes others has force,\nhe who overcomes himself is strong.\n\n**御注 (Yù Zhù):**\nOne who can subdue others may be called strong in force.\nBut one who subdues his own heart, rendering it gentle and weak,\ncan alone preserve his true strength.\n\n**御疏 (Yù Shū):**\nHe who overcomes others relies on cunning and intelligence to prevail—\nsuch a man may be called strong in force.\nHe who overcomes himself masters his own heart,\nmaking it gentle and weak—\nnothing external can overcome him,\nthus he preserves his strength.\n\nHence the Scripture below says:\n*“Guard the gentle, and strength will endure.”*\nAnd again:\n*“The gentle overcomes the rigid,\nthe weak overcomes the strong.”*\nThus, self-mastery is true strength.\n\n**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**\nOne who excels in talent and skill may merely be strong in force.\nBut a strong man has his rival.\nIf he has a rival, his strength and weakness remain undetermined.\nNow, to govern emotions with innate nature—\nthis is self-mastery.\nThe self-mastered have no external rival.\nWithout external rivals, they are truly strong.\n\n**荣 (Róng) says:**\nHe who exerts force—\nthe greater his strength, the more he overcomes others.\nHe who cultivates *德 (virtue/power)*—\nthe higher his virtue, the more he subdues all things.\nAdvancing the Dao and refining one’s practice,\nstrengthening oneself without ceasing,\nnot sinking into error—\nthis is self-mastery.\nThe Daoist, forgetting all concerns,\nis unharmed by external things—\nthus he overcomes others.\nWith a vacant heart and weak bones, strength endures—\nhence the saying: *self-mastery is strength.*\n\n---\n\n**Third: Clarity in Contentment and Resolute Action**\nKnow contentment to be rich,\nstrengthen resolve to have purpose.\nHe who knows sufficiency is wealthy,\nhe who perseveres has resolve.\n\n**御注 (Yù Zhù):**\nHe who knows to be content lacks greed—\nthis is true wealth.\nHe who strives with unflagging effort is resolute—\nthis is true purpose.\n\n**御疏 (Yù Shū):**\nContentment lies in the heart.\nIf the heart knows sufficiency,\nthere is no greed—\neven with coarse food and gourd-drinking,\nhe stands proud and self-sufficient—\nthis is wealth.\nWith unremitting effort and perseverance,\nself-aware and self-mastered,\nhis resolve never wavers—\nthis is true purpose.\n\n**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**\nStrength comes from action.\nIf a man diligently pursues the Dao,\nthe Dao responds to him.\n\n**荣 (Róng) says:**\nHe who knows his place—\nthough he drinks from a gourd, he is rich.\nHe who covets gain—\nthough he hoards a hundred fortunes, he is poor.\nAdorning oneself and striving with vigor—\nthis is resolute action.\nFirm faith in the Dao, ever deepening—\nthis is true purpose.\n\nAccording to the *Nanhua Jing* [Southern Flower Scripture]:\n*Zengzi*, dwelling in Wei, wrapped himself in rags,\nhis face swollen and emaciated,\nhis hands and feet calloused,\nhe went three days without fire,\na decade without new clothes.\nHis crown’s ribbon frayed,\nhis sleeves torn to the elbow,\nhis sandals worn to the heel,\nhe dragged his feet while singing *Shang* hymns—\nhis voice filled heaven and earth,\nas if struck from metal and stone.\nThe Son of Heaven could not make him a subject,\nthe feudal lords could not make him a friend.\nThus, he who nourishes his purpose forgets his form,\nhe who nourishes his form forgets gain—\nthis is the meaning of *contentment.*\n\n---\n\n**Fourth: Clarity in Accepting Death with Integrity**\nTo accept death without forgetting,\nto act in accordance with Heaven’s principle—\nhe who does not lose his place endures,\nhe who dies without perishing attains longevity.\n\n**御注 (Yù Zhù):**\nKnowing contentment and persevering,\nnever losing one’s place—\nthis is to endure in the Dao.\nAgain:\nDeath is the end of one’s appointed fate,\nperishing is the measure of untimely ruin,\nlongevity is the completion of one’s allotted span.\nHe who knows others and overcomes them\ninevitably invites calamity.\nHe who knows contentment and perseveres\nattains Heaven’s constant way.\nHe who attains Heaven’s constant way\ndies without perishing.\nThe completion of one’s span—\nthis is longevity.\n\n**御疏 (Yù Shū):**\nKnowing contentment and resolute action—\nthese are common practices.\nIf one does not lose his constant way,\nhe is one who endures in the Dao.\nAgain:\nHe who does not lose his place\ncan endure long.\nAgain:\nDeath is the end of one’s appointed fate,\nperishing is the measure of untimely ruin,\nlongevity is the completion of one’s allotted span.\nIf one submits to Heaven’s harmony,\ndoes not lose the natural flow,\nand departs in tranquility,\nhe completes his allotted span—\nthis is longevity.\nIf one is not driven onward,\nhis vital essence is incomplete—\nthough *Dan Bao* may have the complexion of an infant,\nthough *Zhang Yi* may boast noble stature,\nif they do not fulfill Heaven’s principle,\nhow can they be called long-lived?\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*“None are longer-lived than the stillborn child,\nwhile Pengzu is counted as untimely.”*\n\n**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**\nIf a man regulates himself,\ndoes not lose his place,\nand cherishes Heaven’s vital essence,\nhe can endure long.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Chapter on the Great Dao**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor the earlier text illuminated the sovereign who serves the Dao—\none who knows himself

means \"avoidance.\"\nThings truly depend on the Perfect Dao for their formation,\nyet the Dao forms them without avoidance.\n\n---\n**Second: When deeds are complete, one does not claim them—\nilluminating the difficulty of naming small or great.**\n\nDeeds are complete yet not claimed as one’s own.\n*Commentary:*\nThings rely on the Dao’s spontaneous action for their transformation,\nyet the Dao does not weary of the labor,\nits functions fully realized—\nit does not claim them as its own.\n\n*Explanatory Commentary:*\n\"Deeds\" refers to the generative

things,\nyet without desire—\nhow could this be the Dao’s narrowness?\nThus, to say \"it can be called small\"\nis to say it *cannot* be called small.\n\n*Further Explanation:*\n\"Clothing and

Sage who governs the world\nspreads virtue and bestows benefits,\nestablishing pure winds and transforming customs,\nthings thus flourishing—\nfollowing the Dao and forgetting deeds,\nnot exalting himself,\nand so accomplishes his great deeds.\n\n*Further Explanation:*\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nforgets self to cherish others,\nquiet and retiring, humble and yielding,\nnever claiming

When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, to govern all under Heaven, all things return and follow.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  This speaks of the ruler holding the Great Dao to govern all under Heaven—without action or affairs, things flourish in their natural order.  Observing the sun and winds, all return to the Dao, thus it is said that all under Heaven come forth.*\n\n*River Master said:  \"Holding\" means guarding.  \"Symbol\" is the Dao/Way.  The Sage guards the Great Dao, and thus all people under Heaven turn their hearts and follow.*\n\n*Rong said:  The Great Symbol is formless, the formless being the vast and empty Dao.  \"Holding\" means to focus and uphold oneself within the realm of profound virtue, to concentrate one’s heart at the gate of quiet seclusion.  When one follows the Dao, all things return, hence it is said that all under Heaven come forth.*\n\n*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  \"Holding\" means upholding, yet this is not holding while holding—it is upholding without upholding anything.  The Great Symbol is like the great Dao’s law and image, that is, the Sage from the previous chapter who upholds the formless Symbol, always skillfully rescuing all things.  Thus, all under Heaven come forth and follow.  The *Zhuangzi* says:  \"The Sage stands without instruction, sits without discussion, emptiness brings forth, fullness returns—Confucius would lead all under Heaven to follow him.\"  This is the same.  When all come forth without harm, peace and tranquility prevail.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, all under Heaven come forth and follow, just as when a household has music and food, passing travelers will stop and stay.  This is a metaphor.*\n\n*River Master said:  \"Bait\" is beauty.  The passing traveler is one and the same—if one can find beauty and joy in the Dao, then they will stop and stay.  \"One\" means to depart from excess and dwell in emptiness, drifting like a passing traveler.*\n\n*Rong said:  The five tones of music are the \"bait\" of joy.  The eight delicacies of food are the \"bait\" of taste.  A hundred years of life is but a passing traveler.  \"Stop\" means to linger, to depend.  To return and follow the Dao, one may attain peace and tranquility.  But if beings do not awaken, few will remain—only those who fix their hearts on strings and pipes, using them to indulge their emotions, or who cling to orchids and cassia, relying on these for comfort, cannot uphold the Symbol.  To seek tranquility is difficult indeed.*\n\n*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  Music is the tones of strings and pipes, the five notes of *guan, shang, jiao, zhi, yu*.  Bait is the savor of food and drink.  Music has pleasing sounds, bait has flavors to delight in—thus even transient travelers, upon encountering them, will stop and linger in love.  The Dao’s utterance is subtle, without taste—*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, to govern all under Heaven, all things return and follow.  The governance is without form, yet its efficacy is boundless.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Sage upholds the Great Dao, and thus all under Heaven’s people turn their hearts and follow.  Governing oneself without harming clarity, then the body is at peace and longevity is assured.*\n\n*Rong said:  When the misty clouds spread and all things are nourished, when the fragrant rains descend and every plant thrives—this is but the benefit of the Dao’s embrace, without harm.  The principle of non-harm: how does it manifest in governance?  When body and spirit remain undisturbed, there is ease; when life and death are indistinct, there is tranquility; when all is harmoniously interconnected, there is great peace.*\n\n*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  \"Tranquility\" is greatness.  When the common folk come to the Sage’s dwelling, all gain benefit without harm.  The benefit they gain is the peace and greatness of the teachings of the Mahayana.  Non-harm reveals the skillful means of suffering; peace and tranquility speak of harmony and delight.*\n\n*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.

      "translated_text": "The Master of the Yellow River said:\n*\"To gaze upon it is not to see\"*—*\"see\"* means *to obtain*. The Dao is formless; unlike the five colors—blue, red, white, black, and yellow—it cannot be grasped by sight. *\"To listen to it is not to hear\"*—the Dao is unlike the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—which can be heard by the ear. *\"Its use cannot be exhausted\"*—when the Dao is applied to govern a state, the nation grows wealthy and the people flourish; when applied to cultivate the self, life is prolonged without end.\n\nHonor said: *\"Exhausted\"* means *complete*. What is visible to the eye is dazzled by hues of green and yellow; what the ear hears is deceived by tones of *gong* and *zhi*; what the heart covets is blinded by treasures and riches. Though treasures serve utility, their use is finite. Though sounds may please, the deaf remain distant. Though colors may charm, the blind are near. Thus, one who knows to cease indulging in pleasures finds rest.\n\nYet the Dao of tranquility and non-action—though unseen by the eye—governs with penetrating clarity, though unheard by the ear—discerns with profound acuity. Though the mind cannot fathom it, those attuned to it act without depletion. The common and the Daoist differ thus; those bound by gain and harm are as such.\n\nMaster Cheng’s commentary:\n*\"To gaze upon it is not to see\"*—the Supreme Dao is profound and mysterious, transcending form and color, unlike food and drink, which cannot be sought through mere visual perception. *\"To listen to it is not to hear\"*—the Great Sound is subtle beyond tone, its essence not like *gong* or *jiao*; it is not grasped by the ears as bells and drums are. The words of the Sage, though spoken, are but examples of their meaning. *\"Its use cannot be exhausted\"*—*\"exhausted\"* means *complete*. The words of the Supreme Dao are serene and boundless, neither sound nor color, transcending sight and hearing. Like a mirror’s heart, it reflects all that comes; like a valley’s echo, it responds as it is stirred. Thus, the use of the Dao, though seemingly without action, is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: \"When One Would Contract It\"**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounds on the Great Sage’s forgetfulness of merit as the refuge of all things. It now reveals the Sage’s use of expedient means in forgetfulness of merit.\n\nThe Sage adapts to myriad paths; the responses are not singular. Sometimes, following the circumstances, they teach lesser doctrines; sometimes, arousing aspiration, they expound the Great Vehicle. Thus, there are true and expedient bodies, real and expedient wisdom. They employ expedient means to honor inferior disciples and uphold the real to guide superior ones. Within expedient and real, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority. This chapter briefly elucidates this meaning.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinctions unfold:\n1. The expedient Dao benefits beings, expanding the paths of governance.\n2. Measuring the two wisdoms, it clarifies that expedient does not surpass the real.\n3. It demonstrates that the expedient Dao cannot be revealed to all.\n\n**First: The expedient Dao benefits beings, expanding the paths of governance.**\nThe Great Dao governs all actions, yet the foolish calculate in vain—like one drinking from the river on the verge of death, wearying in futile pursuit of the sun. To absorb dew and preserve life, one rejoices in the hope of ascending to the clouds. Spring’s fragrance and summer’s lushness unfold in their seasons; rain disperses, clouds gather, and the seven celestial officials align. Sometimes, reversal brings harmony, illustrating the sage’s clear laws. Sometimes, transformation renews, teaching the virtuous to retreat quietly.\n\nWhat of the blind? Though ignorant, they linger in the gates of affection and desire, inevitably losing the realm of stillness. Like a fish escaping water or a sharp blade shown to all, such common beings—how can their lamentations be exhausted?\n\nWhen one would contract it, they must first fully expand it.",

      "translated_text": "The Way that would contract must first fully expand it.\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it.\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it.\nThe Way that would take must first fully give it.\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**.\n\n**Commentary:** The Classic says: *\"Upright speech seems contrary.\"* The *Yijing* says: *\"Diverge to exercise authority.\"* Authority is that which, though contrary to the Way, aligns with principle.\n\nThus, the sage exercises authority while valuing alignment with principle, while the petty man uses it for deceit and guile. Confucius said: *\"One may stand with him, but not yet exercise authority with him—truly so.\"* Therefore, the Old Master in the previous chapter spoke of holding the Great Image—this is called **substance**. This chapter follows with contraction—this is called **authority**.\n\nMeasuring the roots of sentient beings, he thus covers and reverses with substance and authority, compelling them to reach the realm of nature and life. Yet the deluded claim this is not the Dao’s intent—how deeply they err and fail to awaken!\n\nWhen one would contract the emotions of sentient beings, first expand them, exhausting their extravagant desires, so that they become ensnared in love and lust—then contraction follows. The meanings of strength and weakness are similarly applied.\n\nThis Dao is most subtle, yet its effects are clearly manifest—hence, it is called **subtle luminosity**.\n\n**Exegesis:** *Teru* (合) means to contract. This reveals the Sage’s use of authority to transform and guide sentient beings.\n\nSince people have dull and sharp roots, and teaching has both authority and substance, the Sage measures the roots of sentient beings. Thus, with authority and substance, he covers and reverses, revealing the truth: sharp-rooted beings, seeing virtue, turn toward it; having faults, they contract. A slight demonstration suffices to reach their depths. Dull-rooted beings, long mired in delusion, unless transformed through authority, cannot be led to return. Therefore, when contracting the emotions of those who would expand them, first expand them, exhausting their extravagant desires—then they will naturally contract.\n\nThe meanings of strength and weakness are likewise so. Extend this principle, and none will fail.\n\nAt first hearing, one may take this as contrary to the Dao, but upon deep understanding, the purpose of authority and substance becomes clear. Hence the commentary: *\"The sage exercises authority while valuing alignment with principle; the petty man uses it for deceit and guile.\"* The following text further states that it should not be shown to others—precisely because authority is so difficult to wield.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said:\nThe Way that would contract must first fully expand it—first expanding it is to exhaust their licentiousness.\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—first strengthening them is to make them suffer calamity.\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—first elevating them is to make them proud and perilous.\nThe Way that would take must first fully give it—first giving it is to exhaust their greedy hearts.\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**—these four methods are subtle in their Dao, yet their effects are clearly manifest.\n\n**Yan** said:\nThese four methods show that when the Sage is extinguished, virtue naturally arises; when wisdom is abandoned, transformation naturally proceeds; contracting the hearts of all under Heaven while making them expand; weakening the resolve of all under Heaven while making them strong.\n\n**Rong** said:\nThe Way that would contract must first fully expand it—when one would close the *Gui* (兑) and shut the door, the foolish do not comply. Thus, one opens the *Gui* and accomplishes the matter, exhausting them until they cease.\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—when one would still their fierce and mighty hearts, one indulges their rigid resolve. The weak perish, the strong endure—suffering reaches its limit and must stop.\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—when one would decay, it instead flourishes; things reach their extreme and naturally reverse.\nThe Way that would take must first fully give it—when one would take away evil, if evil deeds are not removed, evil accumulates and destroys the self. Only then do they awaken in the moment.\n\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**—though the Sage’s authority seems at first unlike teaching, upon examining its principle, it holds profound potential, most subtly luminous and clearly beneficial. Hence, it is called **subtle luminosity**.\n\nIn eighty-one chapters, the transformations and guidance are broadly expounded, yet common emotions cling, and their grasp differs. When substance is demonstrated and they do not comply, authority is used to transform them, compelling them to return.\n\nThe Mysterious Teaching is profound and far-reaching, fitting for all. Authority is explained first, substance clarified afterward. To contract, one opens the Way’s transformation; to weaken worldly emotions, one strengthens their immortal essence; to abandon evil intent, one offers the true path; to take away evil deeds, one gives them virtuous conduct.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Way that would contract must first fully expand it—*teru* (歙) means to gather, to contract. When exercising authority to transform all classes of beings, those who would not be contracted by substance must first be expanded and indulged, their licentiousness exhausted—then they may be contracted.\n\nIn the past, when the Old Master entered the west to transform the barbarians of *Jibin*, he first indulged their savagery, then transformed them with the Dao—this is the case. The intricate details are fully recorded in the *Wen Shi Nei Zhuan*.\n\nThe Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—when one would lead them to the Dao’s gentle weakness, one must first exhaust their strength, then demonstrate the yielding and soft.\n\nThe Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—when one would abandon their brutal and untamed nature, one must first indulge their ferocity and violence. Once their violence is exhausted, it can be abandoned.

      "translated_text": "「Again it is said: *微隐* means subtle and hidden; *明*, wisdom. This is the subtle and hidden Way of wisdom.\n\n**The Second Section** explains the comparison of two kinds of wisdom: the wisdom of the Way is not inferior to that of authority. The gentle overcomes the rigid.\n\n**御注** states: The *巽* (compliant) can wield authority, and when authority is wielded, it can control all things. Hence, it is known that the gentle and compliant can indeed overcome the rigid and strong.\n\n**御疏** elaborates: The *易* (Classic of Changes) says: *\"巽以行权\"* (The compliant can wield authority). If one desires to clarify that *巽* (compliant) is humble and yielding, then one can practice the Way of authority. Therefore, to make something *翕* (converge), one must first give it *张* (expansion); to make it *弱* (weak), one must first give it *强* (strength). Ultimately, when one leads it to *翕弱* (convergence and weakness), it is the Way of gentleness triumphing over rigidity and strength. Hence, it is said: *The gentle overcomes the rigid.*\n\n**河上公** states: *The gentle endure long, while the rigid perish first.*\n\n**荣** says: The Way of authority follows without resistance, hence it is called *gentle*. Yet it must ultimately control the rigid, hence it is said to *overcome*.\n\n**成疏** explains: *Gentle* refers to the true Way; *rigid*, to the wisdom of authority. To teach those difficult to convert, one must rely on the wisdom of authority. When comparing the two wisdoms, the true wisdom of the Way surpasses that of authority.\n\n**The Third Section** illustrates through analogies that the Way of authority cannot be revealed to all.\n\n*A fish cannot be removed from its depths; the state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people.*\n**御注** clarifies: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to the Way of authority. This states that the Way of authority cannot be revealed to those unworthy of it, hence the analogy: *If a fish loses its pool, it will be captured by men. If the Way of authority is revealed to those unworthy, they will seize it and use it for deception.*\n\n**御疏** further elucidates: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to the Way of authority. A fish in water is like a ruler wielding authority; a fish losing its water is like a ruler losing his authority, and then he will be captured. If the Way of authority is falsely revealed to those unworthy, they will misuse it and practice deception.*\n\n**河上公** says: *A fish cannot be removed from its depths*—if a fish is removed from its depths, it is like losing rigidity and gaining gentleness, and thus can no longer control. *The state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people*—the sharpest tools refer to the Way of authority. Those who wield authority in governing the state should not reveal it to their ministers, nor should those who practice the Way reveal it to those unworthy of it.*\n\n**荣** says: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. A fish swims in the river and lake, relying on them for its livelihood. The Sage’s greatest treasure depends on the subtle and hidden Way of authority. A fish cannot lose its water, for losing it means the fish perishes. The sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people, for revealing them brings peril. Hence it is said: *One can lead people by the Way, but not make them know it*—this shows that the Way of authority must not be entrusted to the wrong hands.\n\n**成疏** concludes: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to authority. A fish hides in water, and authority hides in the heart, so nothing can harm it. A fish loses its water and is captured by others; authority revealed to the people is controlled by them. Hence, it cannot be done.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Way is Ever Without Action**\n\nThis chapter marks the third section of the text, clarifying the ultimate convergence.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text opens two distinct themes: the first converges the essence of the Way, revealing its tranquil stillness while ever in motion; the second converges the essence of the student, displaying the profound mystery of the highest subtlety.\n\n**The First Convergence: The Essence of the Way—Revealing Tranquility While Ever in Motion**\n\nThe wondrous Way of non-action is exalted and detached from worldly affairs, not enduring forever, yet dwelling in obscurity is not dim. The radiant virtue encompasses all life, working unceasingly yet unperceived. The profound roots remain silent, yet all things resonate with it—who can discern? Unlocking the hidden depths of the jade-like treasury, the celestial scriptures ascend to the *上清* (Upper Purity) and *太清* (Supreme Purity). Manifesting the teachings of the jade cabinet, the realms of *罪福* (guilt and fortune) span the *三涂* (Three Stygian Realms) and *九夜* (Nine Nights of Torment). The lonely spirits wail along the *泉路* (path to the underworld), while the stagnant *魄* (ethereal souls) languish in the *苦庭* (court of suffering). Without the great Way to deliver them, who can rescue the lost and bring forth clarity? Though called profound and silent, yet nothing is left undone—teaching the common folk, the power of the Way is now revealed.\n\nThe Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. If rulers could uphold it, all things would transform naturally.\n\n**御注** states: The wondrous origin is pure and tranquil, hence it is ever without action. All things depend on it for existence, yet nothing is left undone—thus all things transform naturally. The ruler’s non-action leads to the people’s simplicity and purity.\n\n**御疏** elaborates: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The nature of the Way is pure and tranquil, its wondrous origin serene and still—hence it is ever without action. All things rely on it for creation, responding with sensation when moved—hence nothing is left undone. Those who act will inevitably have things they cannot do; those who do not act will have nothing they cannot accomplish. If rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. Rulers who guard the pure and tranquil Way, without action or affairs, will see all things naturally respond and transform. The people will then become simple and virtuous through their ruler’s good teaching.\n\n**河上公** says: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The Way’s constancy lies in its non-action. If rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. This means that if rulers guard the Way, all things will transform in accordance with it.\n\n**成疏** explains: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The Way of constancy is silent and tranquil, yet its application arises spontaneously to respond to all things. The earlier sentence is the origin; the later, its manifestation. This reveals that though the Way’s origin is profound and silent, its motion is tranquil and responsive—clarifying the interplay of motion and stillness.\n\nIf rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. The sovereigns of the *万乘* (ten-thousand chariots) and the five ranks of rulers, if they uphold this Way, will see the *八荒* (eight remote regions) and all nations naturally follow and transform. Students are the same. The reason for emphasizing rulers is that their transformation benefits many and spreads widely.\n\n**The Second Convergence: The Essence of the Student—Displaying the Profound Mystery of the Highest Subtlety**\n\nWhen one seeks to act after transformation, I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity.\n\n**御注** states: This speaks of those who, having followed their ruler’s transformation through the Way of non-action, now wish to act with worldly deeds. I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity.",

      "translated_text": "**The Second Convergence: The Essence of the Student—Displaying the Profound Mystery of the Highest Subtlety (Continued)**\n\nThe nameless simplicity is the Dao.\n\n**御疏** states: The nameless simplicity is the Dao. Those who wish to act are those who desire to engage in worldly deeds. *吾* refers to the rulers themselves. It means that once people have received the benevolent teachings and been transformed, the ruler’s virtue of non-action brings purity and stillness. Yet if they still wish to act and engage in worldly deeds, I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity, so that their hearts remain pure and undisturbed by such desires.\n\n**河上公** says: *吾* means the self. The nameless simplicity refers to the Dao. After all things have been transformed, if one then seeks to engage in clever artifices, the rulers must govern and pacify them with virtue and the Dao.\n\n**成疏** states: *作* means to begin cultivation. *朴* is the Dao. It speaks of those who, having first followed the transformation and begun cultivation, inevitably harbor desires for fruition and rewards. Once these desires arise, one must use the nameless, simple Dao to calm their hearts, so that they do not cling to worldly attachments. This is the way of dispelling the worldly with emptiness.\n\nThe nameless simplicity will also not desire. Without desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony.\n\n**御注** states: Once the ruler has restrained the people with the nameless simplicity, one must not cling to this nameless simplicity and leave traces behind. Otherwise, people may seek these traces and lose their original nature, falling back into worldly action. Thus, even this nameless simplicity must be forgotten—without desire, one forgets desire. In tranquil purity, the world will naturally align in harmony.\n\n**御疏** states: The nameless simplicity will also not desire. Earlier, it was said that even if common people desire to engage in worldly deeds, the ruler will restrain them with the nameless simplicity. Now, it is said that even this nameless simplicity should not desire. This is to prevent the ruler from clinging to the nameless simplicity, lest they awaken desires in the people, leading them to seek traces and lose their original nature, thereby returning to worldly action. Such desires would be equal and indistinguishable.\n\nThus, initially, the nameless simplicity is used to restrain the desires of the people. Once the people’s desires are eliminated, the sage’s own nameless simplicity is also abandoned. It is like medicine used to treat an illness—once the sickness is cured, the medicine is forgotten; or a boat used to cross water—once the crossing is complete, the boat is left behind. If one guards the boat after crossing the water or continues to take medicine after the illness is gone, not only will they fail to reach the other shore, but they may also incur new suffering. Without desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony. When the nameless simplicity no longer desires, the desire for it is also forgotten, leading to tranquil purity—this is called *了出* (realization and transcendence).\n\nThe ruler governs through non-action, and the people follow their nature and transform from below. Without the need for teaching or commands, the world becomes peaceful and harmonious. Hence, it is said that the world will naturally align in harmony.\n\n**河上公** says: The nameless simplicity will also not desire. The ruler governs and pacifies with virtue and the Dao, and yet the ruler should also not desire. Therefore, one must transform them with the pure Dao.\n\nThe world will naturally align in harmony for those who can do this.\n\n**成疏** states: The nameless simplicity will also not desire, not merely refraining from desire for worldly laws but also from desire for this nameless simplicity itself. Earlier, it was said to dispel worldly attachments with emptiness; now, it is said to dispel the emptiness with worldly existence. With both worldly and emptiness forgotten, one attains the Dao.\n\nWithout desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony. Stillness is cessation. Earlier, worldly attachments were dispelled with the nameless simplicity; now, the desire for it is dispelled with non-desire. When worldly attachments and emptiness are both forgotten, desire is eliminated, and one attains the Dao. This is the process of dispelling again and again, the profound within the profound—what is called *探幽索隐，穷理尽性* (probing the depths and seeking the hidden, exhausting principle and attaining nature).\n\nSince all dharmas are ultimately true and real, ladders, scaffolding, and all contrivances are none other than the highest Dao. Therefore, it is said that the world will naturally align in harmony. This sentence seals the gate of all profound mysteries.\n\n**End of Volume Ten of the *Moral and Mysterious Classic*—Commentary on the *Profound Virtue***\n**Beginning of Volume Eleven of the *Moral and Mysterious Classic*—Commentary on the *Profound Virtue***",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the *Profound Virtue* – Chapter Thirty-Eight: *Upper Virtue Does Not Virtue***\n\n**Imperial Commentary and Exegesis of the Tang Xuanzong**\n**Commentary by Lord Yan Junping of He Shang, Li Rong**\n**Exegesis by Master Cheng Xuan of Xihua**\n**Compiled by Qiang Sici of Mengyang**\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* is divided into two volumes: the upper text elucidates the *Dao*, the lower text expounds on *virtue*. Yet the upper text also encompasses both *Dao* and *virtue*, though it prioritizes *Dao* as the primary and *virtue* as secondary. Similarly, the lower text also encompasses both, but here *virtue* takes precedence while *Dao* becomes secondary. Thus, the text is structured as *Dao De Jing* (Classic of the *Dao* and *Virtue*), with *Dao* and *virtue* as its twin pillars.\n\nThis single scroll comprises forty-two chapters, its meaning branching into three distinct divisions:\nThe first chapter establishes the foundation of *virtue*,\nChapters two through forty-two expound extensively on the principles of *virtue*,\nThe final chapter synthesizes the preceding teachings.\n\n**First Division: Establishing the Foundation of *Virtue***\n\nWithin this chapter, four further distinctions unfold:\n1. Distinguishing the *virtue* of the upper and lower realms, dispelling erroneous fixation,\n2. Clarifying the *virtue* of *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), and *li* (rites), illustrating the shift from purity to corruption across ages,\n3. Exposing the superficiality of later developments, urging a return to the root,\n4. Denouncing *li* (rites) as the origin of hollow pretense, guiding proper discernment and alignment.\n\n**1. Distinguishing the *Virtue* of the Upper and Lower Realms, Dispelling Erroneous Fixation**\n\nIndeed, *yi* (righteousness) is subordinate to *Dao*, while *Dao* holds supreme dignity. The transformations of Tang and Yu were pure and beautiful, their governance rooted in *wuwei* (non-action), their realm a field of spontaneous harmony where none boasted of virtue or sought praise. They harmonized with the purity of Heaven and Earth, steadied the rectitude of sun and moon. In their midst, things flourished without effort, their actions costing nothing—truly, *upper virtue does not virtue*.\n\nMysterious beyond measure, yet humble and radiant, their *Dao* aligned with the first of the Three Sovereigns. Though they acted, they remained still. When the age of Lu Lu (the legendary era of simplicity) faded, the practice of *li* (rites) and *ren* (benevolence) emerged. As corruption spread, laws became rigid, and the *Dao* of the two *Zhuans* (ancient officials) was abandoned. The wise and sagely grew obscured, and Ji Chang (King Wen of Zhou) suffered seven years of misfortune—yet he never forgot that *yi* (righteousness) was subordinate to *Dao*. Thus, he endured poverty while dwelling in splendor, losing the subtlety of the whole. Even the foolish failed to discern this.\n\n**Upper virtue does not virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.**\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*Upper virtue does not virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.*\n*Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it lacks virtue.*\n*Virtue* is the manifestation of the *Dao*.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"When things attain their natural state, it is called virtue.\"*\nIn ancient times, the pure and unadorned *virtue* was not yet manifest, and thus there was no *virtue* to be named—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* Yet the pure *virtue* did not disperse; through *wuwei*, its influence remained clear—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"*\n\nWhen *virtue* declined, its functions became more pronounced. Though the heart still embodied the *Dao*, its actions leaned toward *wei* (action). *Virtue* could now be named—hence, *\"does not lose virtue.\"* Yet because its traces leaned toward ostentation, it was coarser than the upper—hence, *\"and thus it lacks virtue.\"*\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\n*Upper* refers to the ancient age.\n*Virtue* is the manifestation of *Dao*.\nIn the upper antiquity, pure and unadorned, *wuwei* governed all. The essence of the *Dao* was its foundation, and all things flourished naturally—this was the pure *virtue* of antiquity, hence *\"upper virtue.\"* Yet its *virtue* was so profound that none could name it—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* Yet the harmonious winds prevailed, and all things thrived—*virtue* remained complete—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**\n*Upper virtue does not virtue*—*upper virtue* refers to the sovereigns of the most ancient era, whose *virtue* was so vast that names could not contain it. *\"Does not virtue\"* means they did not govern through *virtue* but followed nature spontaneously, nurturing life—thus their *virtue* was unseen, hence *\"does not virtue.\"* *\"And thus it possesses virtue\"* signifies that their *virtue* aligned with Heaven and Earth, and the harmonious *qi* flowed, allowing the people to thrive.\n\n**Commentary by Li Rong:**\nThe ancient *Dao* was established in the boundless void as its heart, its essence condensed into unity. It required no effort to transform all things, nor did it seek the names of courtesy—how could there be conflict with arms? Though it resided at the pinnacle, it was neither contentious nor named. *Wuwei* was its nature—hence, *\"upper virtue.\"* It acted without reliance, achieved without claiming—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* It nourished all things, allowing them to flourish—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"* Internally, it illuminated *virtue* in harmony with the *Dao*, its meaning thus worthy of reverence—hence, *\"upper virtue.\"* The *Dao* was formless, *virtue* was subtle—its light was concealed, its use was hidden—hence, *\"does not virtue.\"* Though concealed in use, its use was indeed use; though hidden in light, its light was indeed light. With use and light manifest, it benefited all—hence, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"*\n\n**Exegesis by Master Cheng Xuan:**\n*Upper* signifies transcendence and excellence—it is the name for what surpasses. *Virtue* means attainment, its meaning rooted in mastery. Those of *upper virtue* subtly align with the *Dao*, their wisdom merging with reality, transcending gain and loss. Thus, *\"does not virtue.\"* Their wisdom merges with reality—thus, *\"and thus it possesses virtue.\"* When *virtue* is present, loss is dispelled; when *virtue* is absent, gain is dispelled.\n\n**Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it lacks virtue.**\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis speaks of the decline of pure winds and the waning of *virtue*. Thus, the Sage praised the spirit of *wuwei*, yet the people clung to its traces. To cling to traces is inferior—hence, *\"lower virtue.\"* When traces became manifest, *virtue* could be named—hence, *\"does not lose virtue.\"* Though *virtue* was named, its traces leaned toward ostentation. The flaw of ostentation disrupted the purity—hence, *\"and thus it lacks virtue.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**\n*Lower virtue does not lose virtue*—*lower virtue* refers to the sovereigns of the *Hao* (Emperor Yao) era, whose *virtue* did not reach the heights of the upper—hence, *\"lower virtue.\"* *\"Does not lose virtue\"* means their *virtue* was visible, their achievements named. *\"And thus it lacks virtue\"* is because their titles and personhood were now defined.\n\n**Commentary by Li Rong:**\nThe winds of *Dao* and *virtue* were nearly lost, and the transformations of *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) were about to arise.",

arises from *unvirtue*.\n○ Noble lords and highborn, wise and perceptive, yet indulging in arrogance and self-indulgence—this is the *root* of their ruin. *Humility* is the foundation of true nobility, so they must stoop to embrace the lowly, governing themselves with *lowliness*—thus calling themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain.”*\nIs this not taking *lowliness* as their *root*?\nYet they say *“Is it not?”*—this is merely an exclamatory rhetorical question, as if to affirm: *“Indeed, it is taking lowliness as their root.”*\n\nThus, *“count the carriages, yet there are no carriages.”*\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*“Count the carriages”* and there are *“no carriages.”*\nThe *hub* and *axle* are the *root* of the carriage—\ncounting *nobility* reveals *no nobility*;\n*lowliness* beneath is the *root* of *nobility*.\nThe *axle* is the *root* of the carriage—\nif one *fixates* on it, the carriage is *established*;\n*lowliness* is the *root* of *nobility*—\nif one *guards* it, *nobility* is *secure*.\nThis admonishes noble lords:\nto take *lowliness* as their *root*—\nmerely a metaphor for *“counting carriages”* without *carriages*.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*“Thus”* continues the preceding thought.\nEarlier, it was explained that noble lords *gain nobility through lowliness*—\n*nobility* has no fixed form,\nits principle is difficult to clarify,\nso it borrows *“counting carriages”* as an analogy.\nExhausting the *count* of carriages,\nultimately there is *no name* for *“carriage,”*\nyet the *wheel* and *axle* are *falsely* called *“carriage.”*\nThis metaphorizes noble lords:\ncounting their *nobility* reveals *no name* for *“noble,”*\nyet *lowliness* beneath is *falsely* borrowed as the *root* of their *nobility*.\nThe *wheel* and *axle* are the *root* of the carriage—\nif the *root* is *preserved*, there is a carriage;\nif the *root* is *lost*, there is no carriage.\n*Lowliness* beneath is the *root* of *nobility*—\nif the *root* is *preserved*, there is *position*;\nif the *root* is *abandoned*, there is no *position*.\nThis is said to admonish noble lords:\nto cherish and nourish the lowly,\nnot to abandon the solitary and bereaved.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng’s Explanation**:\n*“Thus”* means *“to approach.”*\nPeople approach the *counted carriages*—\nas *spokes*, as *wheels*, as *hubs*, as *poles*, as *carriages*—\nyet there is *no name* for *“carriage”* itself,\nso it *becomes* a carriage.\nThis illustrates that noble lords,\nnot clinging to *exalted titles*,\nare thus *established* in their *nobility*.\n\n○ **Master Róng says**:\nNoble lords are truly *noble* yet *name* themselves *lowly*—\nthese are *Dao*-realized rulers.\nSongs and ballads *praise virtue* yet do not *glorify* them,\nfor this is *“counting praise” yet there is *no praise*—\n*slander* hangs like a *suspended* *jewel*, yet it is not *blame*,\nfor this is *“counting blame” yet there is *no blame*.\nThe *Dao*-embodied gentleman\nremains unmoved by external *honor* or *humiliation*,\n*gain* or *loss*—\nhis *joy* and *anger* do not show on his *countenance*.\n\n○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:\n*“Carriage”* means *“chariot.”*\n*Spokes*, *hubs*, *rims*—\n*falsely* assembled, yet *only* the *name* of *“chariot”* remains.\nCount them, and there is *no substance*—\nthe *Five Aggregates*, the *Four Great Elements*—\nall are *illusion*.\nThus, the *body* being *empty* and *void*,\nwhere shall *nobility* be *lodged*?\nTherefore, in *nobility*, one must *practice humility*.\nOne should not be *polished* like *jade*,\nnor *rough* like *stone*.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*“Polished”* (*liángliáng*)—the *appearance* of *jade*;\n*“rough”* (*luòluò*)—the *appearance* of *stone*.\nTo take *lowliness* as the *root*.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary**:\n*Jade* is *noble*, *stone* is *lowly*—\nlike *jade*, one *exalts* oneself;\nlike *stone*, one *humbles* oneself.\nSince noble lords take *lowliness* as their *root*,\nthey must not be *polished* like *jade* in *self-exaltation*,\nbut rather *rough* like *stone* to *guard humility*.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says**:\n*“Polished”* (*liángliáng*) means *“few”* (in virtue);\n*“rough”* (*luòluò*) means *“many”* (in flaws).\n*Jade* is *few* in *flaws*, hence *blamed* for being *precious*;\n*stone* is *many* in *flaws*, hence *despised* for being *lowly*.\nThis says: *“Do not wish to be like jade, prized by others,\nnor like stone, scorned by others—\nbut dwell in the *middle*.”*\n\n○ **Master Yán

*ten thousand things*.\n\n○ **Master Róng says**:\n*Jade*, *polished* and *few*, is thus *noble*;\n*stone*, *rough* and *many*, is thus *lowly*.\n*Lowliness* is what people *hate*,\n*nobility* is what *things* *attack*—\nboth are *unstable*.\nIn *nobility*, yet *humble and retiring*,\none does not wish to be like *jade* under *attack*.\nIn *lowliness*, yet *aspiring to equality*,\none does not wish to be like *stone* and *abandoned*.\nObtain it with *oneness*,\ndwell in it with *moderation*—\nonly the *highest* and the *lowest*\nare *unstable*;\nall else is *secure*.\n\n○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:\n*Jade*—*nobility*.\n*Stone*—*lowliness*.\n*Polished*—*few*.\n*Rough*—*many*.\nIf one is *internally confused* by the *body*,\n*externally misled* by *things*,\nthen one *values* *lowliness* while *degrading* the *body*.\nNow, having *“counted carriages” yet found no carriage**,\none *awakens* to the *emptiness* of *self* and *things*,\nthus *transforming* into *equality*—\n*nobility* and *lowliness* are *indistinguishable*,\n*separating* from *form*, *abandoning* *knowledge*,\n*merging* into the *Ultimate Dao*—\nthus, one does not wish to be *polished* like *jade* (as *precious*),\nnor *rough* like *stone* (as *despised*).\n\n---\n**“The Chapter of *Reversal*: The Movement of the Dao”**\nThis chapter follows the previous,\nproperly illuminating those who *obtain Oneness*—\n*humble* and *vacant*, *using* the *Dao*,\nthus it is placed here,\nclarifying how such a person,\n*descending* from the *root* and *following* the *path*,\n*stoops* to respond to the *people*.\n\nThis chapter opens into three distinctions.\n**First**, it clarifies *compassionate* *salvation* of *things*,\n*reversing* the *Sage* to *align* with the *common*.\n**Second**, though

When the winds and rains darken the sky,\nwhy does the *phoenix* not stir? Since they do not awaken,\nhow can the *rat* know what is *ugly*?\nThe distinctions among these three ranks lie here.\n\nThe *superior person* hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\n**Emperor

honor,\nthey may succumb to emotion and lose sight of it.\n\n**Lǐ Róng says:**\nLike raw silk, they lack constancy,\nchasing after the fleeting hues of *Dao* and *non-Dao*—\nthe *middle person* is undecided,\ntheir heart shifting with their likes and dislikes.\nHearing the *true Dao*,\nthey preserve their life to stabilize their nation—\nthen they uphold the Dao and abandon the mundane.\nSeeing wealth and desire,\nthey delight in sensory gratification—\nthen they cling to the mundane and forget the Dao.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nThe *middle* in *capacity* have a balanced intellect,\nyet their understanding of principle remains unclear.\nThough they hear the Dao,\nthey cannot fathom its profundity—\nif they restrain their emotions and return to the *Way*,\nthey attain

spreads *qi* and transforms,\nlending life to all existence,\nacting yet not relying,\nentrusting to the natural order.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\n*\"Lending\"* means borrowing.\nThis nameless Dao possesses great compassion,\nthus it descends to save all beings,\nborrowing its virtuous power\nto shelter all creatures,\nnurturing the Three Realms,\nemploying myriad expedients\nto guide them

accomplished in creation—\nthus this chapter clarifies what it generates,\nthough without sequential order.\n\nIts meaning unfolds in three distinctions:\nFirst, it reveals the Dao’s transformative power in generation,\nSecond, it displays the nature of things and exhorts adherence to harmony,\nThird, it elaborates on gentleness and weakness as the foundation of cultivation.\n\n**First: Revealing the Dao’s Transformative Power in Generation**\n\nFrom the One *qi*, refined,\nits principle penetrates the mysteries of subtlety.\nThe Three Pure Ones emerge first,\ntheir essence returning to the Supreme Void.\nSome ride cloud-dragons through the Great Net,\nyet unseen when viewed;\nsome strike zithers and drums to ascend the Precious Realm,\nyet unheard when listened to.\nVacuous and insubstantial, they emerge among mortals;\nserene and silent, they transcend all forms.\nThough chariots and cavalry fill the roads,\nLaozi dines with the common folk at the lips of the people,\nyet moves without exertion.\nThe Celestial Sovereign sits upon the dust of the earth—\nthus it is known:\nthe Dao generates the Three Blows, embracing yin and yang,\nall receiving the harmonious, stabilizing power of the True Mystery.\n\nThe Dao generates One,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nThe Dao generates One—\nOne generates Two—\nOne is the harmonious *qi*.\nThe Dao emits harmonious, wondrous *qi*,\nyet insufficient for generation,\nso it generates yang *qi*.\nYang *qi* alone cannot sustain life,\nso it generates yin *qi*.\nAccumulating the One’s harmonious *qi*,\nthus it is said, *\"One generates Two.\"*\nAccumulating the Two’s yang *qi*,\nthus it is said, *\"Two generates Three.\"*\nThree generates

it generates yin *qi*.\nAccumulating yin to complete the Two,\nthus it is called *\"Three.\"*\nThree generates all things—\nwhen yin and yang harmonize,\nharmonious *qi* becomes pure,\nthus all

Dao’s first generation is One.\n*\"One generates Two\"*—\nOne generates yin and yang.\n*\"Two generates Three\"*—\nyin and yang generate the Three Pure *qi* of clear and turbid,\ndividing into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n*\"Three generates all things\"*—\nHeaven, Earth, and Humanity together generate all things.\nHeaven bestows, Earth transforms,\nHumanity nurtures them.\n\n**Master Róng

below,\nHumanity governs between—\nwhat thing does not arise?\n\n**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**\nOne is the primordial *qi*.\nTwo is yin and yang.\nThree is Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\nAll things are all sentient and insentient beings.\nThe Supreme Dao’s mysterious origin,\nits essence transcending form and name,\ndescending from its root,\nfirst generating primordial *qi*,\nthen from primordial *qi* transforming into yin and yang.\nThus, yang *qi* ascends, clear and pure, becoming Heaven,\nyin *qi* descends, turbid and heavy, becoming Earth.\nThe Two *qi* ascending and descending,\nharmonious *qi* becomes Humanity—\nthe Three Realms arise,\nthen all things are generated in sequence,\nto illustrate the Dao’s power of generous lending.\n\n---\n**Second: Displaying the Nature of Things and Exhorting Adherence to Harmony**\n\nAll things embrace yin while cradling yang,\nharmonious *qi* as their balance.\n\n**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**\nAll things, by receiving yin

The annotation states: \"They act in opposition to all things, and others strike back.\" *Antagonize* means *to oppose*; \"others strike back\" is as in the *Yì Jīng* (Book of Changes), *Yì* (Benefit) Hexagram, Upper Nine line: \"No benefit comes to him, others strike him.\"\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: \"The strong and violent are those who reject the mysterious and profound, who rebel against virtue and the Dao, who do not follow the teachings, and who rely on power and force. To not die their natural death means they are cut down by Heaven’s decree, felled by weapons, or executed by royal law, unable to die in their appointed time.\"\n\n**Master Yán** said: \"Strong Qin perished through tyranny, while Great Han flourished through harmony and compliance. The strong and violent lose the Dao; the rigid and hasty lose their spirit—how could they endure?\"\n\n**Master Róng** said: \"The strong and violent shall not die their natural death—I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation. Those who do not obey their sovereign and parents, who do not follow the Sage’s teachings, who indulge in empty glory and cling to victory, who exalt themselves and oppress others—these are the strong and violent. They violate laws and transgress statutes, do not fulfill their allotted years, and die prematurely, not attaining their natural death.\n\nAll things conform to the Dao; the Sage does not fail to instruct. When human nature strays from reason, the Master of Transformation speaks to them through the sevenfold adornments of virtue, revealing the substance of the Dao. By addressing the nature of the strong and violent, the teachings unfold the method of gentleness and weakness. *Foundation* refers to the origin—taking the strong and violent as the foundation of instruction.\"\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:** \"The strong and violent shall not die their natural death—I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation.\" *Strong and violent* is the same as *rigid and hasty*; *foundation* means *beginning*. It states that those who are strong and violent must perish prematurely, unable to die in accordance with Heaven’s decree. Though the Venerable Master expounds many teachings and subtle methods, he consistently upholds gentleness and weakness as good, and rigidity and strength as evil—this is most fitting, making it the first principle for those who seek the Dao. *I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation.*\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** I have seen the strong and violent perish, while the gentle and weak survive; thus, I take this teaching of gentleness and weakness as the foundation for all teachings.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** *Foundation* means *origin*. This sentence establishes the root of cultivation. The Venerable Master uses the perishing of the strong and violent as a warning and the survival of the gentle and weak as encouragement. To take this as the foundation of teaching means that, like a child to a parent, this teaching of gentleness and weakness is the origin of all teachings.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: *Foundation* means *beginning*. The Venerable Master takes the strong and violent as the initial admonition for teaching.\n\n---\n**Chapter 43: The Most Gentle in the World**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter clarifies that the teaching of gentleness and weakness is the first principle of seeking the Dao. Thus, this chapter is placed next to further reveal the power of gentleness and weakness and the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\nWithin this chapter, the text has three layers:\n1. It presents an analogy to show that gentleness overcomes rigidity.\n2. It explains how gentleness and weakness can enter without obstruction.\n3. It concludes with a sigh of praise for *wuwei*, calling it a rare and precious teaching.\n\n**First: Presenting an analogy to show that gentleness overcomes rigidity.**\nThe five elements all have their uses, yet the spirit of water is the most enduring. The four great elements manifest form, yet none surpasses the utmost gentleness. It gallops across the world, surging against the most rigid obstacles—like the August Floods of the eighth month, when the waters of Du Junping rose in Shu, or the autumnal voyages of Meng Qiang entering Qin. The River Peng shines brightly, its clear currents deep and still, reflecting the Dao of water—without intention, yet pure and undivided—thus it can generate gentleness and weakness. Borrowing this as an analogy, its inexhaustible flow draws one near to the Dao.\n\nThe most gentle in the world\ncan gallop across the most rigid in the world.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** The most gentle in the world is one’s true nature. If one is entangled in worldly affairs, stained by the dust of existence, and overwhelmed by desires, then one becomes the most rigid in the world.\n\n**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** Human nature, in its original state, is pure and harmonious. When *qi* is balanced within, it is the utmost gentleness. But if one is swept away by desires, stained by worldly attachments, and seduced by sounds and colors, then true nature disperses, becoming the utmost rigidity.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: The most gentle is water; the most rigid is metal and stone. Water can penetrate rigidity and enter hardness—there is nothing it cannot pass through.\n\n**Master Yán** said: The Dao can traverse and govern all things under Heaven.\n\n**Master Róng** said: Among tangible things, the most gentle is water. Among the formless, the most gentle is the Dao. Water, though most gentle, can dissolve metal and pierce stone, breaking through rigidity. The Dao, though most gentle, can abandon the self and others, breaking through fixed attachments. If one mirrors oneself in water and embodies the Dao, one can penetrate the distinctions of self and others, traverse mountains and valleys without obstruction—this subtle and mysterious passage is the galloping across the utmost rigidity.\n\n**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:** The most gentle is water; the most rigid is metal. *Galloping* means *attacking and penetrating*. It states that water, though most gentle, can attack and penetrate the rigidity of metal, illustrating how *wuwei*, though seemingly weak, can break the burdens of *youwei* (action). Hence, the following text says: \"In the world, nothing is more gentle than water, yet in attacking rigidity, nothing surpasses it.\"\n\n**Second: Explaining how gentleness and weakness can enter without obstruction.**\nThere is nothing that can enter without obstruction.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:** There is nothing that can enter without obstruction—I know this to be the benefit of *wuwei*. *There is nothing* means not being stained by the dust of existence, making the heart empty of all attachments. *Without obstruction* refers to the Dao’s pure and undivided nature, its mysterious and unified body, with no gaps or separations. If one is not disturbed by desires, making both heart and environment still, empty of all attachments, then the heart aligns with the Dao and enters without obstruction.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the Sage says, *\"I see that when the body and mind are pure and clear, they naturally align with the Dao—this is how I know that the teachings of *youwei* are inferior to *wuwei*.\"*\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\n*\"Wuwei\"* refers to one who awakens to all dharmas, empty of all attachments, and thus returns to their original nature, merging with the Dao and entering *wujian*.\n*\"Wujian\"* is the Dao. *\"Ru\"* means \"to merge.\"\nThe Dao is called *wujian* because its nature is pure and boundless, unified without gaps or separations.\n\n**River Upper Master says:**\n*\"Wuwei\"* is the Dao. The Dao has no form or substance, thus it can move freely without obstruction, transcending the spirit and benefiting all beings.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe spirit and clarity reside within the body, moving without obstruction—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n**Rong says:**\nWater encounters no obstruction; the Dao has no form. Where there are no gaps, it enters everywhere.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\n*\"Jian\"* means \"gap.\" Those lost in illusion see emptiness as existence, while those of enlightened vision see existence as emptiness—thus, *\"wuwei.\"*\nThe teachings of *youwei* are flawed and thus have gaps, while *wuwei* is subtle and seamless, allowing one to enter the profound truth of *wuwei* and *youwei* as one.\nThis is why I know the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\n*\"Wu\"* refers to Laozi speaking of himself. This chapter also instructs rulers, teaching them to govern the world through *wuwei*.\nThus Laozi says, *\"I see that all beings possess a natural gentleness, but when they chase after ambition and competition, they become rigid and strong. If one illuminates and awakens the mind, empty of all attachments, they will merge with the Dao.\"*\nThis shows that the principle of *wuwei* and purity benefits both governance and the self, and is more beneficial to people than the teachings of *youwei*.\n\n**River Upper Master says:**\n*\"I see that the Dao acts through *wuwei*, yet all things are spontaneously transformed—this is how I know the benefit of *wuwei* for people.\"*\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe Dao is formless, yet things are formed; the Sage acts through *wuwei*, yet people are transformed—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\nGentleness can overcome rigidity; emptiness can dissolve existence—thus, I know that the teaching of *wuwei* greatly benefits those who cultivate the Way.\n\n**Third: Concluding with a sigh over the rare teaching of *wuwei*.**\nThe teaching of *wuwei*—unspeakable and beneficial—is rarely attained by the world.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nIt says that among all teachings in the world, few can attain *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThe supreme Dao is wordless; things arise through it. The Sage acts through *wuwei*; transformation is pure. Only when one does not rely on spoken words does teaching take form.\nFew in the world can attain it, meaning that among the hundred schools, few can follow the teaching of *wuwei*. Again, it says that unless one embodies the Dao, none can attain it—thus, *\"rare.\"*\n\n**River Upper Master says:**\nThe teaching of *wuwei* follows the Dao without words, guiding by example. The benefit of *wuwei* is that governing the self strengthens the spirit, and governing the state benefits the people without labor or trouble.\n*\"Few in the world can attain it\"* refers to rulers—few can follow the Dao of *wuwei*. The governance of self and state is the same.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe sound that can be heard reaches a hundred *li*, but the soundless sound moves beyond all boundaries.\nWhat is spoken is understood by others, but the unspeakable is subtly expressed—like the response of Heaven and Earth, or the silent workings of the Dao and virtue, where Heaven and Earth act without speech, and the four seasons cycle endlessly.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe teaching of *wuwei* and its benefits—previously mentioned—are not yet known. To practice the unspeakable teaching is to forget speech, to follow natural processes is to find no tasks, and thus the ruler is at ease above, the subjects content below—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n*\"Few in the world can attain it\"* means many follow *youwei*, but few attain *wuwei*.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**\n*\"Unspeakable\"* does not mean closing the mouth. In principle, it is both existence and nonexistence; in teaching, it is both speech and silence—thus called the unspeakable teaching.\nIt is both existence and nonexistence, thus called the benefit of *wuwei*.\nThe benefit is not a benefit yet is a benefit; the teaching is not a teaching yet is a teaching—this is the ultimate expression of nature and principle, a rare discourse in the world. Few conventional teachings can reach it, hence *\"rare.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Which is dearer, name or body?**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which praised gentleness as the pivot of the Dao, thus explaining that contentment and detachment from desire are essential to true cultivation.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:\n1. A hypothetical scenario with three questions, weighing gain and loss,\n2. An exposition on how clinging to fame and profit harms wisdom and the body,\n3. A demonstration that contentment and detachment can lead to longevity.\n\n**First: A hypothetical scenario with three questions, weighing gain and loss.**\nHeaven and Earth have form, yet they are uneven—east and west tilt and lack completeness.

      "translated_text": "The Master’s Commentary states: Here, fame is weighed against the body. *Na* (孰) means \"who.\" The detailed question asks: If one strives for glory and fame while preserving life, and these two paths are set apart—then which aligns more closely with the Dao of preserving one’s true self and extending years? It laments how people sacrifice their bodies for others’ fame.\n\nMaster He Shang said: To retreat from fame is to bathe in virtue.\n\nMaster Rong said: Between fame and body, which is dearer? Between body and wealth, which is more abundant? Between gain and loss, which brings greater harm? Fame is the external praise of others; wealth is the common man’s silk and jade. The body is the foundation of loyalty and filiality, the bedrock of virtue and Dao. One must abandon external fame and profit, nurture the body and spirit, return to *wuwei*, cultivate the Supreme Way—yet those who perish forget this, and those who chase desires lose their true nature. Thus, fame becomes the blade that slays the body, and wealth the poison that harms the self. Many are lost in delusion, and the Sage pities them. Hence the detailed question: Is it sickness to seek fame and profit? Is it sickness to lose them? The vulgar see fame and profit as good, yet gaining them brings death, losing them brings virtue. To lose is to stand firm; to gain is to perish. Who can discern the sickness of gain and loss? *Wang* (亡) means \"lose.\"\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary states: The body is the inner self, the true essence. Fame is external, a guest. *Na* (孰) means \"who.\" All men seek the external while destroying the inner, greedily pursuing fame while losing substance. What is this? Praise and glorious name are originally for the sake of the body—yet if the body dies for fame, to what end does the fame serve?\n\nThe Old Master, moved by this inversion, asked: Between fame and body, which do you hold dear—yet you feast on fame while forgetting the body? By this measure, the distinction between dear and distant becomes clear. Hence *Zhuangzi* says: \"Bo Yi died for fame beneath Mount Shouyang.\"\n\nBetween body and wealth, which is more abundant?\nThe Master’s Commentary: Those who pursue fame will seek wealth, yet gaining wealth destroys the body. The question asks which is more, urging one to cast away jade and shatter pearls to preserve harmony.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: \"More\" signifies what is precious and weighty. When body and wealth are set apart, which should be valued? This is asked to awaken the realization that the body is more precious than wealth. The note on casting jade and shattering pearls comes from *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters.\n\nMaster He Shang said: Wealth in excess harms the body.\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary: Wealth is originally for the body’s use, yet deluded men sacrifice their lives for it. Thus the Old Master reproaches: Do you discard wealth to preserve the body—is that more beneficial? Or hoard wealth while losing the body—is that more beneficial? Hence *Zhuangzi* says: \"Zhi the Robber died for profit upon the Eastern Ridge.\"\n\nBetween gain and loss, which brings greater harm?\nThe Master’s Commentary: It asks whether gaining fame and wealth or losing them brings greater sickness to the body.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: This summarizes the two questions: Does gaining fame and wealth or losing them bring sickness? Gaining them destroys the body; preserving the body means losing them. The distinction is clear—sickness is evident. Yet deluded men fail to awaken first, so the later text elaborates the answer.\n\nMaster He Shang said: Coveting gain brings sickness to conduct.\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary: Those who greedily seek wealth will surely perish, while those with few desires and no wealth preserve their bodies. Thus, gaining is the sign of self-destruction, losing is the proof of self-preservation. Self-destruction is sickness; self-preservation is medicine. Yet the world reverses this, calling gain fortune and loss sickness—is this not perverse? Hence the teaching asks: Between gain and loss, which is truly sickness?\n\nThe second point clarifies how indulging in fame and profit diminishes wisdom and harms the body. Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss, and hoarding brings thick ruin.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: Those who love excessively must expend greatly. Those who hoard wealth burden the body—this is thick ruin.\n\nThe Master’s Commentary: These two sentences answer the prior questions. \"Excessive love leads to great loss\" responds to *name and body, which is dearer?* Loss here means \"harm.\" The dearer one holds fame, the more they strain their nature, depleting spirit and mind. The more they love, the greater the expenditure. \"Hoarding brings thick ruin\" responds to *body and wealth, which is more abundant?* The more wealth is stored, the greater its ruin—whether through theft or grave robbery, the attacks on jade and pearls, or the plundering of books and tombs. The harm of wealth serves as a solemn warning.\n\nMaster He Shang said: Excessive love leads to great loss. Those who love beauty excessively drain their vital essence; those who love wealth excessively invite disaster. The less one loves, the less one loses—hence it is called \"great loss.\" Hoarding brings thick ruin: In life, wealth is stored in granaries; in death, in graves. The living face banditry and robbery; the dead face grave desecration.\n\nMaster Rong said: Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss—using fame to kill the body is great loss. Hoarding brings thick ruin—using wealth to harm the self is thick ruin.\n\nMaster Cheng’s Commentary: Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss. Loss means \"harm.\" This explains fame: Those who excessively love praise and reputation must greatly tax their form and spirit, depleting their vitality and wisdom. This sentence resolves the question of fame.\n\nHoarding brings thick ruin.\nThe Master’s Commentary: Those who hoard wealth in granaries will face robbery, not only losing their goods but also endangering themselves. Their ruin is deep and severe. Hence the *Book of Documents* says: \"An innocent man with a jade boulder bears guilt.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"The great scholar recited: 'The green wheat grows on the ridge.' He did not distribute in life, so why hoard pearls in death?\" Thus, they struck his jaw with a hammer, pried apart his cheeks—lest the pearl in his mouth remain unharmed. This sentence resolves the question of wealth.",

Commentary:**\nThose whose conduct and practice reach Great Completion\nforget their completion,\nso though complete,\nthey appear as if deficient.\nBecause they forget completion and deficiency,\nthe

      "translated_text": "「The *Dao-De Jing* Compiled Commentary by Tang Xuanzong with Imperial Notes and Explanations\n(Annotations by He Shang Gong, Yan Junping, Li Rong, and the *Xihua* Master Chen Xuying,\nwith contributions from Qiang Siqi)\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The World Under the Dao**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nas the prior passage contrasts the two paths—stillness and agitation—\nand their differing outcomes.\nThus, this chapter reveals the distinction between\nthe world under the Dao and the world without it,\nand their respective merits and demerits.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in four layers:\n1) It illuminates the ruler under the Dao,\nwho governs through non-action and emptiness;\n2) It exposes the tyrant without the Dao,\nwhose agitation, competition, and greed are rampant;\n3) It expands upon the deeper roots of agitation and competition,\nwhere blame and discord grow ever heavier;\n4) It demonstrates the beauty of contentment,\nto encourage those who seek cultivation.\n\n**1) Illuminating the Ruler Under the Dao: Non-Action and Emptiness**\n\nThe Dao is profound and mysterious,\nits divine power not constrained by force—\nthe heavens and earth receive it and remain serene and silent,\nthe sages align with it and dwell in perfect ease.\n\nThe wind does not howl through the branches,\nyet Emperor Yao was praised for his harmonious governance in *Yi Mu*,\nthe rain does not flood the fields,\nyet Emperor Shun achieved great peace in *Tai Ping*.\n\nThus, when King Wu overthrew the Shang,\nhe returned to Hua Yang and tended his horses with leisure,\nand when King Tang defeated Jie,\nhe wandered in the Peach Orchard, letting his cattle graze freely.\n\nThe Five Emperors and the Three Sovereigns\nall aligned with the pure winds of virtue,\ntransforming the world beautifully—\nthis shows that even those who ride in triumph\nmust still return to cultivate the Dao.\n\nTherefore, in the age of the Dao,\nthe warhorses are turned back to manure the fields;\nin years without the Dao,\nthe armies of warhorses roam the wilds endlessly.\n\nThe Great Sage instructs us—\nhis words are not in vain.\n\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nthe warhorses are turned back to manure the fields.\n\n**Imperial Note:**\nThe ruler who governs under the Dao\npractices non-action and spontaneous transformation.\nSince he does not indulge in greed,\nthere are no wars—\nthe warhorses are withdrawn,\nand the people may till their fields in peace.\n\n**Imperial Explanation:**\n*However* (却) means to repel and remove.\n*Manure* (粪) refers to cultivating the fields.\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nit means the ruler governs by the Dao,\npracticing non-action and transformation,\nkeeping the four borders at ease,\nwith no military conflicts—\nhe need not annex more lands,\nlest he burden the common folk.\nThus, he repels the warhorses and weapons,\nand the people may freely plow and till their fields.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nit means the ruler himself is under the Dao.\nTo turn back the warhorses for manuring the fields—\nmanuring here means fertilizing the fields.\nFor the ruler, it means withdrawing his vital *yang* essence\nto nourish his own body.\n\n**Li Rong says:**\nWhen the ruler is under the Dao,\nhe dispenses with the swift warhorses,\nand his subjects practice non-action,\nmanuring the fields for cultivation.\nThose who seek the True Way\nabandon their restless, worldly passions,\nand manure their bodies with virtue and the Dao.\nScholars, cutting off their idle, wandering distractions,\nmanure their minds with study and letters.\n\n**Chen Xuying’s Explanation:**\nThe ruler under the Dao\ngoes forth across the world,\nwith weapons laid to rest and martial arts abandoned,\nthe realm pacified and at ease—\ngoverning through non-action,\nhe thus repels the warhorses\nand lets the fields be manured.\n\nFor the cultivation of one’s body,\nit means repelling the six senses—\nthe warhorses of the mind—\nand manuring the heart with the Dao,\nhence Mencius says:\n*\"All men till their fields with manure,\nyet none know how to manure the heart with learning.\"*\n\n**2) Exposing the Tyrant Without the Dao: Agitation, Competition, and Greed**\n\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\n**Imperial Note:**\nThe ruler who lacks the Dao\nindulges in desires and conquests,\nso the armies of warhorses\nproliferate in the borderlands.\n\n**Imperial Explanation:**\n*Outskirts* (郊) means *boundaries*—\nthe contested lands where defenses are held.\nIt speaks of a ruler who does not govern by the Dao,\nwhose realm is barren and unyielding,\nso the warhorses and armies\ntake root in the borderlands,\nnever returning.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nit means the ruler himself lacks the Dao.\nWarhorses breed in the outskirts—\nthe wars never cease,\nand the warhorses remain in the borderlands,\nnever returning.\n\n**Yan Junping says:**\nThe people’s lives\nhang upon the ruler’s decree,\nand the ruler’s foundation\nrests upon the people’s support.\nWhen the ruler is under the Dao,\nthe ten thousand households flourish,\nand the ancestral temples shine;\nwhen the ruler lacks the Dao,\nthe ancestral temples crumble,\nand the people perish—\nthis is the natural response.\n\n**Li Rong says:**\n*Breed* (生) means *to arise*.\nWithout governing by the Dao but instead indulging in martial pursuits,\nhe adorns himself with weapons and wields force,\nfortifying the four borders,\nraising the five armies—\nthus the warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\nFor the cultivation of one’s body,\nit refers to the restless and competitive man,\nwhose heart does not harbor the Dao.\nHe lets the six senses—\nthe warhorses of the mind—\ngallop freely through the dusty world,\nentangled in endless gains and losses,\nrights and wrongs.\n\n**Chen Xuying’s Explanation:**\nThe *outskirts* (郊) are the lands beyond the capital.\nWhen the tyrant rules the world without the Dao,\nhe plunders both people and lands,\ndisturbing the four quarters,\nhis greed for territory endless,\nhis love of war unceasing—\nthus the warhorses and armies\nproliferate in the outskirts.\n\nFor the cultivation of one’s body,\nit speaks of the agitated and competitive man,\nwhose heart does not cherish the Dao.\nHe indulges the six senses—\nthe warhorses of the mind—\ngalloping through the dusty world,\nnever reflecting on the True Way,\nalways clinging to external things—\nthus it is said that the warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\nWhen the world is under the Dao,\nthe warhorses are turned back to manure the fields;\nwhen the world lacks the Dao,\nthe warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\nThis refers to *noon* (午),\nwhen the vital *yang* essence flourishes.\n*Noon* is the hour of the horse,\nso when the heart is bound,\nit turns east;\nwhen it desires west,\nit turns west;\nwhen it desires south,\nit turns south;\nwhen it desires north,\nit turns north.\n\nThe heart has four gates,\nknowing the four directions—\nall it sees by day and night,\nwhen asleep, becomes dreams.\n\nWhen the heart harbors the Dao,\nthe righteous *qi* flows freely,\nnourishing the limbs and moistening the body,\nlengthening the hair and skin in mystic grace—\nthus the warhorses are repelled,\nand their essence is manured within.\n\nWhen the heart lacks the Dao,\nit generates lust and disorder,\nand the warhorses gallop wildly in the outskirts,\ncorrupting the body’s meridians—\nthus it is said that the warhorses breed in the outskirts.\n\n**3) Expanding Upon the Heavy Blame of the Agitated and Competitive Heart**\n\nNo sin is greater than *desiring what is desirable*—\n\n**Imperial Note:**\nWhen the heart sees what it desires,\nthis is the greatest sin.\n\n**Imperial Explanation:**\nTo break the law is sin,\nand to covet is to incite.\nThe sin of warhorses breeding in the outskirts\ncomes from the ruler’s greed for land—\nwhen he sees the land as desirable,\nhis desire stirs,\nand he seeks to take it—\nthis is the greatest sin,\nhence it is said:\n*No sin is greater than desiring what is desirable.*",

      "translated_text": "Again it is explained: When the sage-ruler teaches well, the realm responds with virtue, and thus without troubling to step beyond the door, the world may be known. Hence the *Yijing* says:\n\n*\"The gentleman speaks forth his words—\nif virtuous, they resonate a thousand li away.\nHow much more so for those nearby!\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**River Above Master** says: The sage knows the world without stepping beyond the door by knowing others through himself, knowing others’ households through his own—thus perceiving the world.\n\n**Rong** says: Observe with the Dao, and no principle remains unseen; illuminate with wisdom, and no matter remains unknown—this is called knowing without action.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: The \"door\" refers to perception and awareness—discriminations like grasping and distinguishing. The sage of the Way, with an empty heart and inner stillness, does not let the mind wander through worldly affairs, yet knows all things under heaven—this is true light illuminating the mundane.\n\n**Not gazing through the window, yet seeing the Way of Heaven.**\n**Imperial Commentary**: Heaven and humanity resonate in harmony; vital essences interflow. When the sage-ruler governs with virtue, the celestial patterns remain unerring, and the five phases are not violated by disorder in yin and yang. Thus the *Shujing* says:\n\n*\"When auspicious omens appear, the winds grow solemn;\ntimely rains fall like admonitions.\nWhen calamities arise, the clouds gather;\nconstant winds blow—*\nif such signs issue from oneself, and their forms manifest in Heaven, why wait to gaze through the window before knowing?\"\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Speech and action—\nthe means by which the gentleman moves Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\n**River Above Master** says: The Way of Heaven and the Way of humanity are one; Heaven and humanity communicate, their vital essences interpenetrating. When the sage-ruler is pure and still, Heaven’s qi aligns; when he is filled with desires, Heaven’s qi grows chaotic. All fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm, arise from within.\n\n**Rong** says: The two luminaries adorn the sky, the five stars gleam in the Han—why must one gaze through the window to see them? To claim \"inner enlightenment\" while gazing through the window is to force interpretations. The Way of Heaven is the natural principle; one need not use snares to catch fish or rabbits, nor labor with words to awaken to ultimate truth—this is seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Window-gazing* is peering with intent; *tao* (牖) are the root orifices. The Way of Heaven is the natural principle—when one sits in forgetfulness of the body, not peering through the orifices, the true heart shines within, revealing the natural Way. This is wisdom illuminating truth.\n\nThe door opens to passage; it is like true light illuminating the mundane. The window’s inner clarity reflects returning to the true source.\n\n**Secondly, it clarifies that ordinary people, through the mind, cannot illuminate.**\nThe farther they go, the less they know.\n\n**Imperial Note**: If one cannot practice *wu wei*, even if commands extend far, one’s grasp of governing principles grows ever slighter.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This explains the ruler who has lost the Way—unable to abide in *wu wei* and humility, he seeks to issue edicts to transform people. The farther his commands reach, the more he strays from *wu wei*, and the fewer his insights into governance.\n\n**River Above Master** says: It is like leaving one’s own home to observe others’ households, leaving one’s own body to observe others’ bodies—the farther one looks, the less one knows.\n\n**Rong** says: Though one traverses the cosmos, one may not recognize mountains and rivers; though one reads all the classics, one may not grasp ultimate truth—this is called ignorance.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: The inverted man cannot illuminate principle; his mind chases after phenomena, ever farther without satisfaction, his knowledge shallow and dim, his discernment lacking.\n\n**Thirdly, it emphasizes those who embody the union of emptiness, stillness, and illumination—still yet able to act.**\nThus the sage knows without action.\n\n**Imperial Note**: Not stepping beyond the door—hence \"without action\"—pure and unadorned, yet knowing the Way of governance.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This further elucidates knowing the world without stepping beyond the door. With no affairs, no action, no commands issued, it is said he does not act. Taking the near from himself, he knows distant things—thus, without my action, people transform of themselves. Why wait for words to issue beyond the door before calling it knowing?\n\n**River Above Master** says: The sage does not ascend to Heaven nor descend into the abyss, yet knows Heaven and Earth—by knowing them with the heart.\n\n**Rong** says: Solitary enlightenment.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Without action* means the mind does not grasp past phenomena, while *knowing* is the ability to perceive truth. The law must ultimately be empty and still—like a mirror hung in a high hall, objects pass before it and are reflected, yet the reflection is without intent. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The sage does not use the mind to illuminate; he illuminates without the mind.\"* This completes the explanation of knowing the world without stepping beyond the door.\n\n**Not seeing yet naming,**\n**Imperial Note**: Not gazing through the window—hence \"not seeing.\" When humanity is harmonious and Heaven obeys, one may name the great peace.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This further elucidates seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window. When the crane cries, its young respond; actions move Heaven—from the small, one may know the great; examining oneself, one may know things. Auspicious omens are summoned by the person himself; thus the transformation of great peace may be attained and spoken of—why wait to gaze before naming?\n\nThe *Shujing* says:\n*\"When the ruler above loves the Dao, the people below love virtue;\nwhen he loves martial prowess, the people below love strength.\"*\nThe sage infers the great from the small, the external from the internal.\n\n**Rong** says: Mystic vision.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Not seeing* means penetrating all phenomena as empty and illusory, with nothing visible. *Naming* means rectifying the names of all things, promulgating manifest teachings. Not seeing yet naming, not responding yet responding—naming without seeing, responding without responding.\n\nThis completes the explanation of seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window.\n\n**Not acting yet achieving.**\n**Imperial Note**: Without issuing commands, yet the world is transformed.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: This summarizes the meaning of not stepping beyond and not gazing through the window. If the ruler above has any action, the people below will be disturbed. Now the sage concentrates his spirit, serene and dignified, silently in the hall—ruler without action, people without affairs, the populace prosperous, all transformations accomplished of themselves.",

      "translated_text": "**River Master (He Shang Gong) said:** When the ruler above does no acting, the people below have no affairs, the populace is well-provided and self-sufficient, and all things transform and fulfill themselves naturally.\n\n**Rong said:** This is the fulfillment of naturalness.\n\n**Cheng Commentary:** *Not acting* means concentrating the spirit in stillness and tranquility, surpassing all doing in its subtlety. *Achieving* means transforming all beings and perfecting those who seek the Way—this reveals stillness in motion.\n\n---\n**Chapter 48: The Daily Increase of Learning**\n*Why this chapter follows:* The previous chapter clarified the distinction between the common and the sage’s mind through their differing illumination. Thus, this chapter follows to distinguish the two paths—Daoist and secular—with their differing gains and losses.\n\nThis chapter’s meaning is divided into three parts:\n1. The distinction between Daoist and secular learning, with their differing gains and losses.\n2. The progression through illusory stages to attain the Mysterious Extremes.\n3. The difference between having affairs and having no affairs, and their respective gains and losses.\n\n---\n**1. The Distinction Between Daoist and Secular Learning, with Their Differing Gains and Losses**\n\nThe Dao of the Primordial Void is profound, its essence subtle and its gate difficult to enter. Its meaning is vast, its essence refined—it precedes the Imperial Symbol, surpasses the Great Netherworld Sage. The Celestial Script shines, revealing the eight-cornered brilliance, the Jade Palace conceals the *Bo* [primordial vessel], encompassing the single vehicle’s banner. How could this compare to secular learning, which daily grows ever more extravagant and superficial?\n\nZhang Zhi’s inkwell remains confined within the cage of the *fanglong* [boundary], Yang Xiong’s study is forever entangled in the ferry of life and death. Unable to daily diminish doing, they instead intensify the very walls they face.\n\n**Learning daily increases; the Dao daily diminishes.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** Those who learn daily increase their knowledge and perception. Those who cultivate the Dao daily diminish their deeds and practices. Increasing knowledge is the gradual path of study; diminishing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment. Thus, through increasing, one accumulates merit; through forgetting merit, one attains the Dao itself.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** *For* means cultivation; *diminish* means forgetting and letting go. Those who first seek learning do so to attain knowledge, refining their deeds to correct their faults. Ultimately, they awaken to principle, forgetting speech and letting go of deeds. Hence the Note says: Increasing knowledge is the gradual path of study—speaking of its beginning. Diminishing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment—speaking of its end.\n\n**River Master said:** *Learning daily increases* refers to the studies of governance, teaching, ritual, and music, which daily grow more elaborate in emotion, desire, and ornamentation. *The Dao daily diminishes* refers to the natural Way, where emotion, desire, and ornamentation are daily eroded away.\n\n**Yan said:** This is the abandonment of knowledge. The knowing that comes from non-knowing is the origin of knowing. The teaching that is not taught is the essence of teaching. It is the foundation of divine clarity, the teacher of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Rong said:** *Learning daily increases*—expanding with scrolls, lengthening with perception, sharpening with fame, and multiplying with cravings. *The Dao daily diminishes*—practicing the teaching of non-action, dual forgetting of form and principle, embodying the void and the mysterious, abandoning self and other alike. When one attains non-doing, all doing is lost; when one has no affairs, all affairs are diminished. How much less so the proud, the swollen, the extravagant, and the indulgent!\n\n**Cheng Commentary:** *Learning daily increases*—*for* means cultivation; *learning* means secular learning. Those who cultivate worldly learning sharpen their discriminations, thus their desires daily multiply. *The Dao daily diminishes*—*for the Dao* means cultivating the Way. Those who cultivate the Way attain emptiness and tranquility, so their wisdom and virtue gradually clarify, and their entanglements daily diminish.\n\n---\n**2. The Progression Through Illusory Stages to Attain the Mysterious Extremes**\n\nDiminish again, and again diminish, until reaching non-doing.\n\n**Imperial Note:** Diminish again, and again diminish, until reaching non-doing. Non-doing yet nothing is left undone. Those who learn accumulate deeds; those who cultivate the Dao forget diminishing. Though they diminish deeds, they still retain the intention to diminish. When even this intention is forgotten, they attain the tranquil state of non-doing. Like a mirror reflecting all things without obstruction, thus nothing is left undone.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** *Diminish* refers to diminishing the deeds of those who cultivate the Dao. *Again diminish* refers to eliminating the very intention to forget deeds. Thus, the first diminishing forgets traces, the second diminishing forgets the mind. When both mind and traces are forgotten, one attains the ultimate. Attaining the ultimate is reaching non-doing.\n\n**River Master said:** Diminish again, and again diminish—this diminishes emotions and desires. Again diminishing is the gradual means of removing them. Until reaching non-doing, one should remain serene as an infant, doing nothing at all.\n\n**Rong said:** Merging existence into non-existence is diminishing. Existence departs, non-existence is not forgotten—this is diminishing again. The principle is dark, the truth is still—this is non-doing.\n\n**Cheng Commentary:** Those who learn cling to desires; those who cultivate the Dao cling to non-doing. Though their depths differ, both are equally stagnant. Now, to rectify these two fixations, there is the text of *diminishing again*. First, diminishing diminishes existence; then, diminishing diminishes non-existence. Both extremes are abandoned, reaching the non-doing within unity.\n\n**Non-doing yet nothing is left undone.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** When virtue and the Dao merge, there is nothing they do not accomplish, nothing they do not do.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** Doing entails obstruction; obstruction entails limitations. Now, since there is non-doing, non-doing entails no obstruction, thus nothing is left undone. This is the harmony with the Dao, responding universally and comprehensively. Hence, the earlier volume states: *The Dao is ever non-doing, yet nothing is left undone.*\n\n**Rong said:** To remove burdensome existence, one must return to non-doing. Yet those deluded, hearing of non-doing, sit idle with folded hands, taking cold ashes for the Great Way and a clod of earth for the utmost mind.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Fearful that one might rigidly cling to non-doing, unable to transcend and dissolve [its limitations], it is said: \"Non-doing yet nothing is left undone.\"**\n\n**Non-doing yet nothing is left undone is not true non-doing; having action yet returning to non-doing is not true action.**\nThis is the essence of both learning the Dao and embodying the Dao—both share the same aspiration. Only when motion and stillness both cease does harmony prevail.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** When stillness reaches its depth, motion arises as its manifestation; thus, nothing is left undone. The earlier volume states: *The Dao is ever non-doing yet nothing is left undone.*\n\n**Thirdly, it clarifies the distinction between having affairs and having none—gain and loss differ.**\n**To govern the world, one must always act without interference.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** Non-doing and non-affairs mean the world naturally submits; thus, one may govern the world.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This exhorts the sovereign to practice non-doing. \"To govern\" means to harmonize and transform. To transform the world, one must act without interference and without affairs—without affairs, the people are undisturbed; without interference, the people find ease. With such governance, what cannot be achieved? The \"always\" refers to never separating from non-affairs in guiding the people.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** \"To govern\" means to rule. One must always govern the world without interference, not with labor and agitation.\n\n**○ Rong said:** To govern the world, one must always act without interference. But when affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world. \"To govern\" means to harmonize—when forgotten, there is neither attachment nor abandonment; when applied, there is both suitability and unsuitability. If one governs the world through non-doing, there is nothing that cannot be harmonized. If one governs the world through affairs, there is nothing that can be harmonized.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** \"To govern\" means to harmonize and transform. It speaks of harmonizing and governing all under heaven, guiding them toward goodness through non-affairs and non-doing. Though responding to things with action, the heart remains untroubled—this is motion within stillness. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *Who is so exhausted that they make things into affairs?* When affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n**Imperial Note:** Affairs bring agitation; agitation brings exhaustion—thus, it is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** Affairs refer to oppressive decrees and dense legal nets—harsh orders disturb the people, while strict laws multiply punishments. The people grow restless, and the four quarters scatter. If one seeks to harmonize and transform, how could it not be difficult? Thus, when affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** When one favors affairs, governance becomes burdensome, and the people are unsettled—thus, it is insufficient to rule the world. \"To govern\" means to rule.\n\n**○ Rong’s Commentary:** \"To govern\" means to harmonize—when forgotten, there is neither attachment nor abandonment; when applied, there is both suitability and unsuitability. If one governs the world through non-doing, there is nothing that cannot be harmonized. If one governs the world through affairs, there is nothing that can be harmonized.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** When the heart is not yet empty and forgotten, treating affairs as affairs while being entangled in them—then affairs differ from non-affairs, non-affairs differ from affairs, motion diverges from stillness, and stillness contradicts motion. Such a person is unfit to harmonize and transform the world.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the prior text elucidates *immediate affairs as non-affairs*—though responding without attachment, it is thus followed by this chapter, revealing how the Sage, without a fixed heart, can still respond to stimuli.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:\n1. It clarifies that the Sage has no fixed heart, responding as stimuli arise.\n2. It shows the Sage’s benevolent salvation of the people, without abandonment.\n3. It reveals how beings are entangled in delusion, prompting the Sage’s compassion and pity.\n\n**First, it clarifies that the Sage has no fixed heart, responding as stimuli arise.**\n\nThe Great Sovereign rides the times, facing all directions to teach, while the True Lord governs the people, holding the celestial axis to bring peace. Their bellies full, all sing in harmony—without relying on imperial might. Unbuttoned, they savor themselves—how could they know the profound workings of heaven and earth? Ten thousand things move in unison, witnessing the overflowing transformation of the Zhou. The Eight Trigrams attend to affairs, measuring the pure winds of the age of Yao. Thus it is said: *The Sage has no fixed heart*, yet limbs and strength are fully exerted. Though chaos reigns, the seasons do not falter; though time shifts, the mysterious power sustains all. Opening a red heart to the world, the Sage seeks to transform people—aligning with the people’s hearts, how could it not be vast and boundless?\n\n**The Sage has no fixed heart; the Sage takes the people’s hearts as their own.**\n\n**Imperial Note:** The Sage’s heart responds to stimuli as they arise; responses arise from stimuli, hence no fixed heart. Though the heart is unfixed, it is always directed toward transforming goodness in the people.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** The Sage is empty and forgotten; stimuli arise, and responses follow. Responses must follow stimuli, and since stimuli vary, the heart has no fixed nature. Though unfixed, the intent is to save with compassion—for the people have untrustworthy and unvirtuous hearts, so the Sage blends their own heart with theirs to guide and transform them. Hence, it is said: *The Sage has no fixed heart.*\n\n**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** The Sage has no fixed heart—the Sage values adaptability and follows suit. They conform to what benefits the people.\n\n**○ Yan said:** The heart of no-heart is the master of the heart. For a single body, without the heart, danger becomes safety; with the heart, safety becomes peril. If the Sage above contains the transformation of virtue and power, and below encompasses the hearts of ten thousand people—whether things are great or small, they view the heart as their own body. Abandoning personal desires, they take what brings ease to others, achieving great harmony.\n\n**○ Rong said:** The ruler above has no attachment to action, trusting the people’s self-transformation. The Sage has no emotions to distinguish, responding to all things with resonance.\n\n**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** The body of the Dao is concentrated and refined, the mind empty and free from thought—its stillness matches the boundless void. Thus, it has no heart.",

The common folk all use their ears and eyes as the Sage’s own vision and hearing.\n\n**Róng** said: The common folk cannot restrain their emotions with their nature, but instead indulge their hearts in desires, pouring their ears and eyes into sounds and colors, fixating their noses and mouths on fragrances and flavors. Thus, they fall into confusion and blindness. The Sage follows their afflictions to prescribe teachings, adapts to their circumstances to guide them, and transforms them through his own nature. He says, *“I alone remain like an infant or newborn, unaware of how sounds and colors delight the ears and eyes.”*\n\n**Chéng Shū** said: *Addiction* means entanglement and stagnation. Those lost in delusion drown in the world’s illusions, indulging their ears and eyes in colors and sounds. Drifting aimlessly, they wander without hope of return. The Sage pities their deep confusion and thus reveals their afflicted state. Among the six senses, he highlights two to emphasize how these two are the deepest roots of attachment. Hence, the *Xī Shēng Jīng* says: *“Ears and eyes, colors and sounds—oh, how you linger!”* By mentioning these two, all senses are implied, though the text is concise.\n\nThe Sage treats them all as infants.\n\n**Yù Zhù:** The Sage pities the common folk as a mother pities her children, thus viewing them all like infants.\n\n**Yù Shū:** Since the common folk pour their ears and eyes to observe the Sage, the Sage regards them as a mother regards her children, hence *“treats them all as infants.”* Another interpretation: The common folk possess discriminating hearts, but the Sage transforms them to goodness, making them like infants—without distinction.\n\n**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: The Sage loves and cares for the common folk like worms or infants, nurturing and raising them without expecting repayment.\n\n**Chéng Shū** said: All beings indulge recklessly in their ears and eyes, sinking into the river of desire. The Sage, with earnest dread and compassion, rescues them—his duty akin to that of a mother to her child. He pities their ignorance as one pities a helpless infant.\n\n*(End of Volume XIII of the Dao De Jing’s Mysterious Virtue, with the missing “then” restored from the Zhou Yi.

      "translated_text": "「○ Master Héshànggōng said: When people seek life with excessive fervor, their actions invite death—thirteen paths lead to death’s **Dao**.\n\n○ Róng said: The reason one falls into death’s **Dao** is due to the thirteenfold accumulation of transgressions.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: In general, when people are drawn to death’s **Dao** at every turn, it is because they cling to these thirteen delusions, entangled by past karmic influences.\n\n**Second hypothetical question-and-answer**, clarifying its cause.\nWhy is this so?\n○ **Imperial Commentary**: Why is this so? It is because of their excessive attachment to life. The question is: Why do they fall into death’s **Dao**? It is because of their excessive attachment to this life.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: This poses the question of why sentient beings fall into death’s **Dao**.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: Why do they fall into death’s **Dao**?\n\n○ Róng said: Why is this so? It is because of their excessive attachment to life. How do they reach death’s **Dao**? They exhaust the **Dao** of their nine orifices (*jiǎo*), strain the **Dao** of their four limbs (*guān*), indulge in deeds that invite death (*sìyè*), and cherish a body that is impermanent (*wúcháng*). When their indulgence exceeds measure, they fall into death’s **Dao**.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: This is a hypothetical question answered in terms of life’s **Dao**. It is because of their excessive attachment to life.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: This is the direct answer, stating that sentient beings fall into death’s **Dao** because they are immersed in worldly deeds (*yǒuwéi*), drowned in emotional desires, and indulge excessively in self-nurturing to sustain this life. Their attachment to life is too deep, hence they fall into death’s **Dao**.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: The reason they fall into death’s **Dao** is that their pursuit of life’s affairs is too excessive, defying the **Dao** and harming Heaven (*lián tiān*), acting recklessly and losing proper conduct (*shī jì*).\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: It means they cannot embody the **Dao** and forget life, yet cling to life as something real (*shēng wéi yǒu*), amassing wealth and resources to sustain this life, and overindulging in its pursuit—thus they fall into death’s **Dao**. This sentence answers the previous question.\n\n**Third exposition on the virtuous cultivation of life**, where one is not harmed by the **Three Poisons** (*sāndú*).\nIndeed, those who cultivate life with virtue,\n○ **Imperial Commentary**: Those who cultivate life with virtue—when walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. The rhinoceros has no place to strike its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and the soldiers no place to wield their blades. Those who cultivate life with virtue have no intent to harm others, so when walking on land, they do not seek out rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Thus, tigers, rhinoceros, and soldiers also have no intent to harm them.\n\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: *Shè* means to guard. It refers to those who virtuously guard life with the **Dao**, perceiving its origin with profound insight. Originally pure and serene, they forget life itself in life, not letting emotional desires disrupt their harmony. They nourish their nature with emptiness and fluidity, and nothing can harm them—thus they are called virtuous guardians.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: *Shè* means to nurture.\n\n○ Róng said: Indeed, those who cultivate life with virtue—when walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Those who do not nurture their nature are internally harmed by emotional desires and externally harmed by venomous creatures. The virtuous cultivator of life does not indulge, their nature is unharmed, their heart is free from poison, and nothing can harm them.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: *Guāi* is an incomplete phrase; *wén* means to hear or perceive subtly. *Shè* means to guard and also to nurture. It speaks of those who virtuously guard and nurture life, embodying forgetfulness, emptiness, and tranquility, not lightly entangled by worldly influences. Their guarding and nurturing are revealed in what follows.\n\nWhen walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: The rhinoceros emerges from the Xiāng River to the south, is blackish-green in color. According to *Éryǎ*, it resembles a wild ox with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* (≈120 lbs). The virtuous cultivator of life does not stir harmful intent toward others, so when walking on land, they do not seek out rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battlefields, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Thus, rhinoceros, tigers, and soldiers also have no harmful intent toward them.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: When walking on land, they naturally avoid rhinoceros and tigers, and harm does not approach them. When entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers, for they do not delight in killing others.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: When walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers. *Lù* means flat ground. The rhinoceros is a venomous beast with one horn, resembling an ox, green in color. It states that the virtuous cultivators of life are not touched by venomous beasts. Internally, it means they reside peacefully, untouched by afflictions. When entering battle, they are not harmed by weapons. Internally, it means even amid worldly entanglements, they are not harmed by sensual passions.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to strike its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and the soldiers no place to wield their blades.\n○ **Imperial Annotation**: Earlier, it was explained that the virtuous cultivators of life have no harmful intent within, so externally they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers. Here, it is shown that even if they meet such beasts or soldiers, the latter have no place to strike or harm. Thus, one knows that those who forget emotional attachments toward others can tame and befriend seagulls of the sea, domesticate and ride beasts of the land—how much more so would they avoid harm! Hence, there is no such harm.\n\n○ Master Héshànggōng said: Those who nurture life, tigers and rhinoceros have no means to harm them, and blades have no way to strike.\n\n○ Róng said: It means nurturing life with the **Dao**, accumulating virtue through action. Earlier, it was shown that they do not meet evil; now it is shown that even if they meet it, they suffer no harm.\n\n○ Chéng’s annotation: *Zhù* means to stand; *cuò* means to set. The rhinoceros, upon encountering something, will charge with its horn—symbolizing ignorance (*chī*). The tiger is fierce and violent by nature—symbolizing anger (*zé*). Weapons are sharp and can harm others—symbolizing greed (*tān*). It states that those who cultivate life virtuously embody profound insight into true emptiness, so even amid the world, they are not harmed by the **Three Poisons**.\n\n**Fourth repetition of the question**, praising the virtues of those who cultivate life with mastery.»",

Do rhinoceros, tiger, weapons, and armor have no room to strike? It is because they follow nature without selfishness, not treating death as death, so that things cannot harm their life—hence it is said there is no place of death for them.\n\n**The Great Master’s commentary**: This question inquires why the rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons do not harm others. By posing this question, it seeks to clarify the matter for people.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said**: Why do rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons not harm?\n\n**Róng said**: Why then? Because there is no place of death for them. The one who gives life to me is **God/Qi**, the one who kills me is my own mind. If I can extinguish the mind and still the thoughts, not entangle myself in activity, then there is no place of death.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation**: By posing this question, the reason becomes clear. Because there is no place of death for them.\n\n**The Great Master’s commentary**: This is the proper response. Those who see their own bodies as real are burdened by them; the deeper the attachment to life, the greater the power of death. Yet those who cultivate life virtuously perceive the **emptiness of dharma-nature (法性空)**, understanding that the body is merely a false appearance. Thus, they can forget life while in life, not err through excessive nurturing, and follow nature without selfishness—so there is no place of death to be found. Since the mind has no place of death, how can tiger, rhinoceros, or weapons harm their life?\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng said**: Because they do not violate the **thirteen divine prohibitions (神营护之, 此物不敢害之)**, the **Dao/Way** protects them, and these creatures dare not harm them.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation**: Those who see their own bodies as real treat the body as a place of death. Now, those who cultivate life virtuously forget the false appearance of the body, and thus the body is without a body—there is no place of death.

Here, the meaning branches into four distinctions:\n\n1. **Illustrating the Dao/Way’s moral transformation and nurturing of the common people (黎元).**\n2. **Exhorting all beings to revere the Dao/Way and hold virtue/power in high esteem.**\n3. **Expounding the boundless compassion and transformative power of emptiness.**\n4. **Concluding with the profound virtue/power that benefits others while forgetting one’s own merit.**\n\n**First: Illustrating the Dao/Way’s moral transformation and nurturing of the common people.**\n\nThe forms of all living things, from the most base to the most refined, rely on the **cosmic breath (氤氲)** for their birth and the **subtle essence (妙)** for their spiritual dissemination. Though wisdom and folly differ, and noble and base forms vary, the great peng bird and the humble *yuan* (鴳) know not of distance, nor do the cicadas and crickets discern the seasons. The plum and willow bloom with fragrance in the moonlit night, while flowers and butterflies dazzle with their charm in the garden. What merit could compare to this natural function? The **Dao/Way** alone is constant.\n\nIt is like the great sea, containing all things, or like the heavens, covering all beneath. Within every flower and leaf, the **Dao/Way** resides.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** gives birth to them; **virtue/power** nurtures them.\n\n**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** *\"The Dao/Way gives birth to them\"* means the **Dao/Way** descends the harmonizing **qi**, refining all things so that each may live—thus, it is said the **Dao/Way** gives birth to them. The **Dao/Way** is called the **Mystic Source (妙本)**, for it is the origin of the **qi** that sustains all things, hence the name *Mystic Source*.\n\n*\"Virtue/power nurtures them\"*—**virtue/power** is what is **obtained (得)**, and **nurturing** is **cultivation (畜)**. All things obtain the **Dao/Way’s** function and are thereby nurtured; this is why it is said **virtue/power** nurtures them.\n\n**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things.\n\n**Chéng’s annotation:** The supreme **Dao/Way**, vast and mysterious, gives life to all things.

The Creative knows the Great Beginning; the Receptive completes the things. Heaven and Earth provide form; above and below establish position.

      "translated_text": "**○ Róng says:** When **moral cultivation** is emptied and forgotten, it naturally attains eminence and nobility—not by conferred titles, but only then does it earn reverence and esteem.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** The eminence and honor of the world must rely on rank and office, yet this is not enduring. But the eminence of **moral cultivation** and **virtue/power** is unrelated to titles, hence it is ever naturally so.\n\n**Third:** Broadly manifesting emptiness and universality, **palace of compassion** and **transformative birth**. Thus, the **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things and nurtures them.\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Increase and growth daily\" (增进日长).\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This concludes the initial chapter’s meaning of the **Dao/Way** giving birth. To begin is to give birth; to nourish is to raise.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way**’s relation to all things is not merely to give birth—it further fosters, matures, and nurtures them to perfection, preserving their nature and life. Likewise, a ruler governing state and self should act thus.\n\n**○ Yán says:** \"Giving birth and nurturing\" concludes the first two lines, with \"increase and growth daily\" as *rù* (抚, to nurture) and *yù* (育, to cultivate), *chén* (成, to perfect) as mutual aid, *shú* (熟, to mature) as completion, and *yǎng* (养, to nourish) as provision. *Fù* (覆, to shelter) is protection—these eight are the functions of **moral cultivation**, hence their eminence and nobility.\n\n**○ Róng says:** This broadly elucidates the **Dao/Way’s** function of giving birth and nurturing. \"Increase and growth daily,\" \"nurture and cultivate daily,\" \"establish and perfect daily,\" \"fulfill and mature daily,\" \"provide and nourish daily,\" \"clothe and shelter daily.\"\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** This reiterates prior text to introduce what follows. Yet it speaks only of the **Dao/Way** and not **virtue/power**, for **virtue/power** does not differ from the **Dao/Way**, though the text is concise. Thus, the *Xī Shēng Jīng* (《西升经》) states: **\"Moral cultivation** is a chaotic unity, profound and mysterious in harmony.\"\n\n**Long** (長) **them, nurture** (育) **them.**\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Nurture\" means to soothe and comfort.\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** \"Increase and growth daily\" is nurturing; \"soothe and comfort\" is cultivation.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** \"Long\" refers to fostering their virtuous sprouts; \"nurture\" refers to advancing their practice.\n\n**Perfect** (成) **them, mature** (熟) **them.**\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Perfect\" and \"mature\" are the same as \"nourish\" and \"shelter\"—thus, all revere the **Dao/Way** and hold **virtue/power** noble.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** \"Mutual aid\" is perfection; \"completion\" is maturation.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** With the supreme wondrous method, refining all things’ minds, the **Dao/Way’s** fruit is perfected, **virtue/power’s** practice refined—this is merely reiterating prior language to introduce what follows.\n\n**Nourish** (养) **them, shelter** (覆) **them.**\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** \"Provide and sustain daily\" is nourishment; \"shade and protect daily\" is shelter. These eight are the functions of **moral cultivation**, hence all things revere and hold it noble.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** \"Nourish\" means repaying their fruits; \"shelter\" means shading them with great compassion.\n\nThe above four pairs elucidate the **virtue/power’s** benefit to all things; the following three sentences reveal its capacity to transcend function.\n\n**Fourth:** Concluding the **profound virtue/power**, benefiting all while forgetting its own function.\n\n**Giving birth yet not possessing** (生而不有),\n**Imperial Commentary:** \"Giving birth yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, fostering yet not ruling\"—this is called **profound virtue/power**, as fully explained in the *Zǎi Yīng Pò* chapter. That chapter speaks of human cultivation as the **Dao/Way**; this chapter clarifies the **Dao/Way’s** use aligning with humanity.\n\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things, yet does not appear to possess what it generates, forgetting its generative function—concluding the **Dao/Way’s** generative meaning.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** generates all things yet takes nothing for itself—this is its beneficence.\n\n**○ Róng says:** \"Giving birth yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, fostering yet not ruling\"—this is **profound virtue/power**. Those who claim its function are not its true functionaries; those who rely on its **virtue/power** are not its great practitioners. Now, since it neither relies nor rules while giving birth and fostering, this is the deepest, most mysterious **virtue/power**.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Though it can generate all things, in truth there is nothing to generate. Like the straw dog of common sentiment, it is thus \"giving birth yet not possessing\"—having yet not having, generating yet not generating. This transcends the **Dao/Way’s** generative function.\n\n**Acting yet not relying** (為而不恃),\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** **Virtue/power’s** nurturing does not appear to act upon things; it does not rely on its function—concluding the **virtue/power’s** meaning of nurturing.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** may act, yet does not expect recompense.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Having generated and perfected all things, it possesses no claim to their birth. Applying laws and teachings, upon what may it rely? This transcends **virtue/power’s** nurturing function.\n\n**Fostering yet not ruling** (長而不宰),\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** With **moral cultivation** forgetting the functions of giving birth and nurturing, though it stands as the longest among all things—fostering, maturing, and perfecting them—it does not rule or demand recompense from them. This is said to urge rulers to model themselves after the **Dao/Way’s** generative nurturing while forgetting its function.\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** fosters all things yet does not carve or dominate them for use.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Fostering the people’s lives, its function equals that of creation itself, yet both agent and recipient are illusory—who then rules? This transcends the four pairs of \"long,\" \"nurture,\" etc.\n\n**This is called profound virtue/power.**\n**○ Imperial Commentary:** This is the praise of forgetting.\n\n**Profound** (玄) **is the name for what is deep and unfathomable.** Though the Great **Dao/Way** can generate and nurture, it ultimately neither relies nor rules. Its **virtue/power** is universally pervasive, yet its traces are not manifest—is this not the deepest, most unfathomable **virtue/power**?\n\n**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way’s** actions are profound and obscure, unseen.\n\n**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** This refers to the preceding sentence and points to what follows. **Profound** is the name for what is deep and far-reaching; **virtue/power** is its protective manifestation, referring to those who embody the **Dao/Way**, benefit all while forgetting function, and follow the Sage—truly **profound virtue/power**.\n\n---\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of All Under Heaven**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounds on the **Dao/Way’s** capacity for transformation and benefiting all while forgetting its own function. Hence, this chapter reveals the **Dao/Way** as the **Origin-Mother**, urging all to cultivate it. Its meaning is divided into four parts:\n1. The **Dao/Way** as the **Origin-Mother**, exhorting all to begin cultivation.\n2. The method of cultivation and the mystery of closure.\n3.

It contains the void within its grasp, motionless and tranquil, yet able to wander at the dawn of things. In stillness and silence, it forgets all, returning to the root of the Dao/Way.\n\nConfucius composed his discourse, and yet he marveled as if struck by a dragon.\nZhuangzi perfected his words, yet he submerged his form like an ant.\n\nIf one **blocks the senses** and **shuts the gate**, laboring ceases for life—\nand thus one’s vitality is fully preserved.\n\n**The Origin of All Under Heaven is the Mother of All Under Heaven.**\n\n**御注:** *The Origin is the primal qi; this wondrous qi generates all things, possessing nurturing virtue, hence it can be the Mother of All Under Heaven.*\n**御疏:** *The Origin is the daily qi; the Mother is the daily nurturing. The Dao, through this primal qi, generates all things—just as a mother gives birth to her children, hence it is called the Mother of All Under Heaven.*\n\nThough the Origin-Mother differs from the Dao/Way’s qi, its transformation is ever unified.\nThus, the Classic above says:\n*\"Nameless, it is the Origin of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the Mother of all things.\"*\n\nThis is spoken to make one know the source and recognize the root,\nto guard the Mother while preserving the child.\n\n**River-Upper Master says:**\n*\"The Origin of All Under Heaven is the Dao/Way.\nThe Mother of All Under Heaven is the Dao/Way as the Mother of all things.\"*\n\n**Rong says:**\n*\"The Dao/Way is the root of things, hence it is called the Origin.\nIts virtue nurtures, hence it is called the

the Classic above says:\n*\"Nameless, it is the Origin of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n*\"The Mother of all things\"* means:\nFrom the root descending, guiding the masses,\nnurturing and raising them like a

scatter.\nHumans arise from the Dao/Way,\nand return to the Dao/Way.\nNow, instead of seeking the Dao/Way,\none must return and guard it—\nthus, \"guard the Mother again.\"\nTo preserve the body without peril means\nthat one can accumulate virtue in hidden and manifest deeds,\nharming no thing—\nhence, \"no peril.\"*\n\nThis clarifies that Mother and child guard each other,\nroot and branch gather—\nthose who practice this bring stability to their families and states.\n\n**成注:**\n*Having known oneself as the Dao/Way’s child,\none must return and guard the Mother.\nOnly by returning to

true practice?\n\nIf I were but slightly knowledgeable in governance,\nI would walk the Great Dao of non-action,\nnever straying onto the narrow paths of contrivance.\nIn all my deeds, I would most fear failing to uphold it.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*\"If I were\"*—this is a hypothetical speech.\n*\"Knowledge\"*—discrimination.\n*\"Slightly\"*—small and subtle.\nThe true Dao is supremely level and plain,\nyet if one were to stir even a slight thought of knowing and acting,\nthis would be to stir up false distinctions—\na movement that is deeply perilous.\n\nFor the Ultimate Dao is void and boundless,\ntranscending all distinctions.\nIt neither clings to falsity nor to truth,\nfor truth and falsity share the same essence,\nand life and death are one continuum.\nIt enters the nine abysses yet remains unobscured,\npasses through the three realms yet remains unilluminated,\nwalks through peril yet remains at ease,\nfaces great calamity yet knows no fear—\nthus, there is no dread.\n\nBut now, with thoughts and distinctions arising,\none strays from the original heart.\nAll deeds become steps toward ruin—\nthus, they are truly to be feared.\n\nThe Great Dao is supremely level,\nyet people love the crooked paths.\n\n**Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThe Great Dao is plain and easy,\nyet those with knowledge fear it—\nfor men, being prone to schemes,\nseek

unobstructed,\nyet people prefer crooked shortcuts.\nBut the Dao’s transformation lies in non-action—\nnon-action is plain and easy.\nYet those who govern instead\ncannot still their minds in desirelessness,\nbut labor their hearts to meet demands.\nThough they may initially seek shortcuts for speed,\nthey ultimately lose the Dao and disrupt harmony—\nhence, *\"people love the crooked paths.\"*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Great Dao is supremely level—\n*level*—plain,\n*great*—easy.\nYet people love crooked paths—\n*paths*—crooked, not straight.\n\n**Master Rong

      "translated_text": "「善建章」—**Chapter on the Foundation of Virtue/Power**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one, for the prior chapter expounds upon those ensnared by greed and defilement, who stray from the norm and lose the Dao. Hence, this chapter clarifies those who harmonize with the Dao and align with the True, urging all to cultivate and practice, thus succeeding one another.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning is divided into three distinct teachings:\n1. To elucidate those who establish virtue/power, shining the Dao for future generations;\n2. To demonstrate how self-cultivation and benefiting others broadens their virtue/power;\n3. To measure the extent of gain and harm, thereby exhorting students of the Dao.\n\n**First: To elucidate those who establish virtue/power, shining the Dao for future generations.**\nThe Yellow Emperor, through his casting of the Tripod and ascending of the Dragon, established the Dao’s radiance.\nThe Huai King, with his elixir of immortality and mastery over cranes, ascended to the realm of the Purple Forbidden.\nIn the land of the Wondrous Milky Way, the myriad sages gathered at the Hall of Pure Jade.\nIn the Heaven of Verdant Clarity, the thousand True Ones convened at the Precious Tiles.\nHow did they attain such heights?\nThrough the **virtue/power** of establishing virtue/power.\n\nObserve Chen Zhi’s cultivation in his village—virtuous stars gathered afar—and hear of Duke Jing of Qi’s cultivation in his realm—Mars receded in flight.\nHe tasted the wine of the crossroads, finding harmony in its balance,\nand discarded his left-hand chariot horse to behold beauty in its purity.\nThe Zhou were called the \"Great Treasure’s descendants,\" ruling for eight hundred years,\nwhile the marketplace of Qi returned righteousness,\nits gates hosting three thousand guests.\nThe **virtue/power of the unshakable** is thus manifest.\n\nThose who establish virtue/power are **unshakable**.\n**Imperial Commentary:** The sage who can establish the Dao in governance and lay the foundation for the realm cannot be overthrown or uprooted.\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Establish* means to found. *Unshakable* means not to be toppled or uprooted.\nIt speaks of rulers who, through the Dao, establish their own conduct and the realm’s foundation.\nWhen the people do not act corruptly,\nand the myriad folk transform naturally,\nthen they refine them with sincerity,\nnurture them with noble customs,\nso that their laws inspire trust,\nand their governance is without end.\nThus, their achievements are profound and lasting,\nall under heaven returning to virtue/power.\nSuch is the **virtue/power of the unshakable**—how can they be overthrown?\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: *Establish* means to found. Those who establish their conduct and the realm through the Dao cannot be dragged away or uprooted.\n\n**Master Li Rong** said: Those who establish virtue/power are **unshakable**; those who embrace it are **unsevered**.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nIf one can establish conduct within the realm of the supreme Dao,\nthen their roots are deep and **unshakable**.\nIf one cultivates marvelous virtue/power within the domain of the Mysterious,\nthen their base is firm and **unsevered**.\n\nWhen governing a realm, their ancestral temples endure across generations,\nand when managing a family, their offerings rise unbroken.\nTheir teachings flow like shadows from the True Qi,\nand their legacy is sustained by the Mysterious Wind.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Establish* means to found. *Unshakable* means not to be toppled.\nThose who skillfully establish the Dao in their hearts and steady their resolve\nin the True Dao’s realm are **unshakable**.\n\nThose who embrace virtue/power are **unsevered**.\n**Imperial Commentary:** If one can embrace the Dao and virtue/power to govern the people, they cannot be separated from it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Embrace* means to uphold. *Unsevered* means not to depart.\nThose who embrace the Dao and virtue/power to govern the people—\nwhen they move, the people follow in delight—\nhow can they ever depart?\n\nMoreover, even delicious bait can retain a passing traveler,\nyet how much more so the Dao and virtue/power,\nwhich surpass this?\nTo wield them in governance,\nthe people will naturally return to them—\nthis is their proper course.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: Those who embrace the Dao to nurture their spirit\nwill never be dragged away or severed.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Embrace* means to hold fast. *Unsevered* means not to lose.\nThe prior sentence speaks of the initial resolve,\nthis of the enduring practice.\nIt says those who hold fast to the True Dao—\nonce obtained, forever retained—\nwill never falter.\n\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n**Imperial Commentary:** It speaks of those who establish and embrace the Dao and virtue/power,\nwhose merits extend to posterity,\nwho cherish their ancestral shade,\nand whose descendants are perpetually nourished.\n\nFor the king, the ancestors have merit,\nand the lineage has virtue.\nThus, the Zhou’s rise began with Hou Ji,\nand its completion lay with King Wen and King Wu.\nThe Zhou’s sacrifices included:\nthe ancestral rites to Hou Ji,\nthe lineage rites to King Wen.\nEven when divination predicted thirty-six generations,\nand a lifespan of seven hundred years,\nthe ancestral rites to Hou Ji and King Wen\nnever ceased—\nwhether the main temple was destroyed,\nor its streams overflowed beyond.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Sacrifices* means to offer. *Unceasing* means daily rites.\nIt refers to descendants perpetually offering rites to their ancestors and lineage.\n*Cease* means to stop.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: *Cease* means to cut off.\nIf one cultivates the Dao as such,\nthey attain longevity and immortality,\nand their sacrifices to ancestors and temples\nnever end across generations.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Cease* means to cut off.\nThose who embrace virtue/power align with principle.\nOnce they hold to this True practice,\nand transmit it to future generations,\nit is like the Primordial Beginning passing to the Highest Sage,\nor Xu Zhen imparting to Ge Xian.\nThe lineage of teachers and disciples continues,\nforever serving as the master of instruction—\nlike the unbroken transmission of a lamp’s flame.\n\nThus, the *Sutra of Western Ascension* says:\n*\"Learn from me, teach from me—\nnever lose the True Dao.\"*\n\n**Another Interpretation:** It speaks of those who establish virtue/power,\nwhose virtue is profound and lasting,\nwhose accumulated goodness brings blessings,\nand whose lineage flourishes eternally,\ntheir ancestral halls enduring forever.\n\n**Second: To demonstrate how self-cultivation and benefiting others broadens their virtue/power.**\nCultivate in one’s self,\nand their virtue/power becomes **True**.\n**Imperial Commentary:** Cultivating the Dao in one’s person,\ntheir virtue/power is **True** and pure.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Below, it clarifies that lesser cultivation yields lesser attainment,\nwhile greater learning brings greater reward.\nThus, *cultivate in one’s self* refers to cultivating within one’s own body,\n*cultivate in one’s family* refers to cultivating within one’s household.\nBeginning with the self,\nand ending with the world—\nthe pattern is clear.\n\nIt speaks of those who establish virtue/power,\nwhose **True Nature** is illuminated in purity,\nfree from all falsehood and impurity.\nWhen falsehood and impurity are exhausted,\ntheir virtue/power is **True** and pure.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s self—\nnurturing qi and spirit,\nextending life and years—\ntheir virtue/power is thus **True**, and they become True Ones.\n\n**Master Li Rong** said: Cultivate in one’s self,\nand their virtue/power is **True**.\nCultivate in one’s family,\nand their virtue/power has excess.\nCultivate in one’s village,\nand their virtue/power endures.\nCultivate in one’s realm,\nand their virtue/power flourishes.\nCultivate in the world,\nand their virtue/power is universal.\nThe Dao cannot be neglected in cultivation,\nnor virtue/power in establishment.\nTo establish virtue/power and cultivate the Dao—\nfrom the self to the family, to the realm—\nwherever they go, they bring stability.",
      "overlap_context": "he Dao yet remains in ignorance,\ntheir fields grow overgrown—\ntheir heart is neglected.\nTheir granaries lie empty—\nthey lack virtue/power.\nTheir garments are adorned with fine colors—\nthey delight in empty words.\nThey wear sharp blades—\ntheir greedy heart is honed.\nThey weary of plain food—\nthey indulge in rich flavors.\nTheir goods overflow—\nthey hoard without giving.\n\n*The Daoist True Classic of Mysterious Virtue/Power—\nCommentary by Master Cheng, Volume Fourteen ends,*\n*Volume Fifteen begins.*",

Simply observe oneself. When a sovereign is pure, acts without action, and establishes and embraces the Dao, the people naturally gather, and the realm’s longevity is assured.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Observe the sovereign who cultivates the Dao with the sovereign who does not cultivate the Dao.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this [standard].\n\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe oneself and others with this standard, and it shall be known.\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** This is a rhetorical question. The Old Master asks: How do I know that establishing and embracing the Dao leads to unshakable prosperity and enduring virtue? By observing oneself and others with this standard—from the self outward to the realm—it shall be known. Thus, the *Yijing* says: *\"Observe my life\"* and *\"Observe its life,\"* meaning one must first observe oneself before observing others.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** The Old Master speaks of how I know that those who cultivate the Dao prosper, while those who abandon it perish—by observing these five [aspects], it is known.\n\n○ **Honor [Rong] said:** How does one know that cultivators prosper and non-cultivators perish? Observe one body, and a hundred bodies may be known; observe one realm, and ten thousand realms become evident—how much more so the Three Dynasties?\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Chapter on Abundant Virtue**\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior elucidates cultivating the Dao for the benefit of others, embodying the Dao and uniting with the True. Thus, this chapter returns to describe such a person as one of abundant virtue.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning is divided into four parts:\n1. The infant as metaphor, showing the absence of the Three Poisons.\n2. The embodiment of the Dao in emptiness and forgetfulness, thus the Three Activities are pure.\n3. Praising the virtuous and abundant, knowing harmony and constancy.\n4. Contrasting those who cling to the mind, whose actions defy the Dao.\n\n---\n**First: The infant as metaphor, showing the absence of the Three Poisons.**\n\nThe Dao-heart is subtle, abundant virtue is profound—like the love for an infant.\nFirst, the account of Zhou Yu’s abandonment, the survival of Wu Tu, and the ancient saying of the Chu people.\nHis sinews and bones are frail, yet he holds harmonious *qi* without action,\nUnknowing of male and female, guarding the yielding and soft to fortify himself.\nUpright and detached from the world, carefree and beyond dust,\nHis form hides in humble dwellings, yet his mind soars above the blue clouds.\nCould he be like Yi You in declining office, or Guangcheng Zi in refusing the lord?\nHe hears thunder yet hears nothing, sees Tai Mountain yet sees nothing—\nHis eyes are closed in boundless freedom, his steps unconstrained.\nThis is the highest sage’s cultivation, the infant’s true attainment.\n\nAbundant virtue is like that of the infant.\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** The Perfect One who harbors profound virtue and the Dao is like the infant.\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** *Contain* means to harbor. The Perfect One, harboring deep virtue and the Dao, is internally protected by virtue and externally guarded by the numinous—like a mother’s care for her infant. This truth is difficult to grasp, hence the metaphor.\n\nThus, the infant’s wholeness and harmony are used to illustrate the Perfect One’s complete virtue.\nThe infant, the smallest of children, is taken as an example because within, there is no distinction, and no heart to harm others.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Abundant virtue refers to one who harbors profound virtue and the Dao, like the infant—divine protection surrounds those who contain virtue, as parents do for their child.\n\n○ **Honor [Rong] said:** Harboring the Dao and embracing virtue, accumulating deep and sincere actions, *qi* focused and unyielding, desires extinguished and without greed, the True Child undispersed—like the infant.\n\n○ **Citation of Cheng [成疏]:** Harboring virtue and the Dao is supremely pure; to illustrate this, the infant is compared.\nThe infant’s conduct is detailed below:\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not attack,\nHawks do not snatch.\n\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):** The Perfect One is divine—harm cannot touch them. Since there is no heart to harm others, there is no ground for stinging or seizing. This is the Perfect One’s abundant virtue.\n\n**Imperial Citation (御疏):** This elucidates the Perfect One’s complete virtue.\nPoisonous creatures: bees and wasps.\nFierce beasts: tigers and rhinos.\nHawks: falcons and sparrowhawks.\n*Sting*: using the tail’s venomous end.\n*Attack*: pressing with the feet.\n*Snatch*: seizing with claws.\nThe Perfect One’s virtue is complete within, harmonious *qi* overflows, the heart merges with the Dao—thus, venomous creatures cannot sting, fierce beasts cannot attack, and hawks cannot snatch. This arises from their utmost conformity to virtue’s depth.\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Poisonous creatures do not sting—bees, wasps, snakes, and *qi* do not sting. Fierce beasts do not attack, hawks do not snatch—the infant harms no thing, and things harm no infant. Thus, in the Age of Great Peace, people of all ranks possess benevolence; creatures with barbs revert to their nature, and venomous beasts do not harm humans.",

      "translated_text": "「○ **Rong said:** When venomous creatures strike, it is called *sting* (螫); when fierce beasts press with their feet, it is called *attack* (据); when hawks seize with their claws, it is called *snatch* (搏). The reason infants cause no harm is twofold: first, they lack inner poisonous intent; second, their tender hearts are shielded by maternal kindness, so they are not injured.\n\nThose who embody *virtue/power* (德) neither possess malicious intent nor allow venomous creatures to unleash their venom, nor do fierce beasts find means to attack. This is because their hearts are pure and the Dao’s blessings descend to protect them.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** Venomous creatures refer to snakes and *qi*-beasts (虺). Hawks (获乌) include falcons and sparrowhawks (鹰鹯). Fierce beasts (猛兽) are rhinos and tigers (兕虎). *Sting* (螫) means to deploy venom. *Snatch* (搏) means to strike or grasp. Infants do not violate the realm of the *Dao* before them, hence they are not harmed by these three creatures—this illustrates how those who embody *virtue/power* transcend the three poisons (三毒) without obstruction.\n\nThe second passage explains how the *Dao* achieves emptiness and forgetfulness, thus purifying the three *actions* (三业). Their bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grasp is firm.\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** Weak bones and soft sinews yet firm grasp—before they comprehend the union of *yin* (雌/牝) and *yang* (雄/牡), their vital *qi* (□) surges unceasingly. This is the utmost refinement of *essence* (精), and they cry all day without hoarseness, achieving perfect harmony.\n\nInfants, though weak in bones and sinews, can clench their fists with unyielding strength. Before they know the interplay of *yin* and *yang*, the source of their vital *qi* (□) moves naturally, as pure as the essence itself. They cry ceaselessly from morning to night yet their voices remain unbroken—this is the peak of unspoiled harmony, the infant’s complete attunement.\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary (continued):** This section further elucidates the infant’s perfect harmony. Though their sinews and bones are frail, their grasp over objects is inexplicably firm—is this not due to their harmonious *qi* never dispersing?\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, with weak sinews and bones, yet grasp objects firmly, do so because their focus is unshaken and their hearts do not stray.\n\n○ **Rong said:** Infants’ firm grasp of their thumbs with weak sinews and bones is not from strength but from the concentration of their hearts. Though others may attempt to pry open their fists, they cannot. Those who embody *virtue/power* bend their bodies to conform to things and soften their hearts to follow the *Dao*. Though others may desire to sway them, they remain unopened—this is the natural preservation of *True Reality* (全真).\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** It speaks of infants with weak sinews and bones yet firm hands, likening those who embody *virtue/power* to beings of gentle nature, compliant and harmonious. Though they mingle with the world, their inner purity remains untouched—whether stained or not, they hold fast. This illustrates the purity of their *intentional actions* (意业).\n\nBefore they comprehend the union of *yin* (牝) and *yang* (牡), their vital *qi* (□) surges. Yuzhu’s commentary explains: *Yin* is the feminine (雌), *yang* is the masculine (雄), and □ refers to the source of life *qi*. Though infants do not yet understand the union of *yin* and *yang*, their vital *qi* (□) moves naturally—is this not from the utmost concentration of their *essence* (精)?\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, unaware of the union of male and female, yet their *yin* (阴) surges with anger—this arises from their abundance of *essence* (精).\n\n○ **Rong said:** The union of *yin* and *yang* (牝牡) is the convergence of *yin* and *yang* (阴阳). □ (作) means the infant’s *yin* (童儿阴) moves. *Anger* (怒) here means *stirring* (动). Though infants do not yet grasp the rites of male and female, their *yin* (阴) stirs—this is the utmost refinement of *essence* (精), which does not disperse. When *essence* scatters, the body withers; when the body withers, life ends.\n\nThose who embody *virtue/power* reject external passions yet cherish their *essence*, abandon laborious exertions and treasure their *qi*. They have no intent to stir, yet stirring does not disrupt their stillness. They empty themselves in stillness, yet stillness does not hinder their movement. Stillness does not impede movement—though they move, it is not true movement. Movement does not disrupt stillness—though they are still, it is not true stillness. Movement without hindering stillness is the utmost refinement of *essence*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** The *Zilin* (字林) states: □ (作) refers to the infant’s *yin* (小儿阴). It speaks of infants, newly born, not yet understanding the union of *yin* and *yang*, yet their *yin* (阴) constantly stirs—this is due to their *essence* and *qi* (精炁) being full and undispersed. Moreover, those who embody *virtue/power* and align with the *Dao*’s pure harmony, practicing *wuwei* (無為) and emptiness, yet still propagate teachings in the world, listening to sounds and seeing forms while intuitively grasping the truth of *emptiness* (真空), do not perceive the union of *yin* and *yang*—this is the utmost refinement of *essence*, illustrating the purity of their *physical actions* (身业).\n\nThey cry all day without hoarseness—this is the peak of harmony.\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** *Hoarseness* (嗄) means a voice broken by strain. Infants cry from dawn till dusk yet their voices remain unbroken—is this not from their harmonious *qi* being utterly pure?\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, from morning till evening, cry without their voices changing—this arises from their abundance of harmonious *qi*.\n\n○ **Rong said:** When crying reaches its extreme without sound, it is called *hoarseness* (嗄). Infants cry constantly from morning to night yet their voices do not grow hoarse—this is because their harmonious *qi* has not yet dispersed. Those who embody *virtue/power* expound profound truths without fatigue, and their teachings flow endlessly without cessation—this too is from their attunement to harmonious *qi*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** It speaks of infants crying all day without hoarseness—this is because they cry without intent, their harmonious *qi* undispersed. Those who embody *virtue/power* and intuitively grasp the *Dao*’s essence can thus speak of the unspeakable. Though they employ all things, they do not contradict the principle of *no speech* (無言)—this illustrates the purity of their *verbal actions* (口业).\n\nThe third passage praises the beauty of embodying *virtue/power*, knowing harmony and abiding in constancy.\n\nKnowing harmony is called *constancy* (常).\n○ **Yuzhu’s annotation:** To remain steadfast in harmony and gentleness, like an infant, is the practice of knowing *constancy* (常).\n\n○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** This concludes the infant’s attunement to utterly pure harmonious *qi*, which does not fail, as a lesson for others. If one can, like an infant, know the principle of harmony and gentleness, and practice it without deviation, this is called the practice of *True Constancy* (真常).\n\n○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** If one knows that the gentle and weak harmonious *qi* is beneficial, then they understand the *Dao*’s constancy.\n\n○ **Rong said:** Knowing harmony is called *constancy* (常); knowing *constancy* is called *clarity* (明). The loss of *essence* and depletion of *qi* leads to *non-constancy* (無常). To know harmony is to preserve *constancy* and avoid death. Those who embody *virtue/power* not only know the principle of harmony but also grasp the meaning of *constancy*—all things are illuminated, hence it is called *clarity*.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** *Knowing this is non-speech*—those who do not speak are those who embody pure harmony’s principle. To know the *Dao*’s constancy is to abide in *True Constancy*’s path (真常之常道).」",

They commit the error of abandoning the *Dao* and instead magnify the faults of those who stray.\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: If one can embody the *Dao*’s *constancy*, then they daily attain *clarity* and insight into the profound mysteries.\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: To know *True Constancy*’s *Dao* is to attain wisdom that illuminates *clarity*.\n\n**The fourth couplet reveals the error of fixated intent, actions contrary to the *Dao*.**\nTo force *qi* for longevity is ill-fated.\nThe Master’s annotation: *Longevity* (祥) refers to auspicious or inauspicious omens. If one does not know how to guard *constancy* but instead seeks excessive *qi* for life, they invite ruin—this is inauspicious.\n\nThe Master’s commentary: *Longevity* (祥) refers to auspicious or inauspicious omens. If one cannot fully harmonize with *constancy* but instead cultivates *qi* beyond measure, they fail to realize that such excess only depletes *essence* and *qi* further. Thus, forcing *qi* for longevity is an inauspicious omen.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"Longevity arises from following Nature, yet do not force *qi* for life.\"*\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: *Longevity* (祥) means \"growth.\" To force *qi* for life is to seek endless growth, which is futile.\n\nRong said: *Forcing qi for longevity* (益生日祥) means the mind compels *qi* to grow stronger. *Longevity* (祥) is \"good,\" while *strong* (强) means \"excessive.\" This reveals those who follow worldly teachings and cannot emulate the infant’s natural grasp or embody the *virtue/power* of harmony. Those who claim to know harmony yet pursue *qi* through indulgence or medicinal means—seeking to make *qi* excessive and never decline, to maintain goodness without corruption—can they truly succeed?\n\nHence it is said: *\"All know what is good, yet none understand what is not good.\"*\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: *Longevity* (祥) means \"abundance.\" Ordinary people do not grasp the *Dao* of life and death, greedily clinging to worldly gains, and excessively forcing *qi* for life—thus their afflictions and hindrances grow ever broader day by day.\n\n*The mind compels qi to grow stronger.*\nThe Master’s annotation: The mind has distinctions of right and wrong, while *qi* has none. If one enslaves the mind to force *qi*, they become a person of excessive rigidity.\n\nThe Master’s commentary: The mind holds distinctions of right and wrong, yet *qi* itself does not. Thus, yielding to *qi* brings softness and weakness, while forcing the mind leads to rigidity and excess. Those who abandon the *Dao* and force *qi* for life enslave the mind to compel *qi*, making *qi* serve the mind’s will—this is excessive rigidity. Hence the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Do not listen with the mind, but listen with the *qi*.\"*\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: The mind should be singularly focused on harmony and softness, while the *qi* remains inwardly settled. Yet those who act recklessly disrupt this balance, and the harmonious *qi* departs from within, causing their form to grow rigid and strong day by day.\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: The mind is the *spirit* (神), and *qi* is the body (身). The world’s emotions are inverted, and confusion arises from mistaken perceptions. How could they know that all phenomena are empty, or recognize that the self is but an illusion? Once they enslave the *spirit* to command the body, driving it through ceaseless labor, their karmic bond to birth and death grows ever more potent.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they age—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* brings early decline.\nThe Master’s annotation: All things, when at their height, must decay. Thus it is warned: *\"To boast of strength and rely on vigor is to go against the *Dao*—this should be stopped early.\"*\n\nThe Master’s commentary: This reveals the error of excessive rigidity and deviation from the *Dao*. *Vigor* (壮) means \"unyielding strength,\" while *aging* (老) means \"decay and exhaustion.\" All things that flourish must decline, and when vigor reaches its extreme, aging follows. Those who use the mind to force *qi* and boast of their strength only hasten their own decay. To call this *not the Dao* is correct, for the *Dao* values softness and weakness, yet these people rely on rigidity—contrary to the *Dao*—and thus are urged to cease early.\n\nThe Master of the Riverbank said: *When things reach their peak, they age*—all things, when at their height, wither and grow old. *Not the Dao*—those who age cannot attain the *Dao*. *Not attaining the Dao brings early decline*—those who do not attain the *Dao* die early.\n\nRong said: *Things reach their peak, they reverse*—when vigor is at its extreme, decay follows. This is the eternal burden of worldly attachment; how could they comprehend the *Dao* of emptiness and tranquility?\n\nThe *Venerable Lord* (老君) laments that sentient beings have yet to awaken to *constancy*, to cherish *qi*, and instead cling to worldly actions that force *qi* for life. Such forcing only brings harm, as it contradicts supreme truth. Thus he warns: *\"Cease early.\"*\n\nThe Master Cheng’s commentary: *When things reach their peak, they age*—this is called *not the Dao*. All things that flourish must decline, and when vigor reaches its extreme, aging follows. This proves that forcing *qi* for life only confirms *non-constancy*. Since it is *non-constancy*, it cannot be the true *Dao*. *Not the Dao brings early decline*—*decline* (已) means \"to stop.\" If one can awaken and recognize that *non-constancy* is not the true *Dao*, they should cease early and not indulge in false practices.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: \"The Silent Sage\"**\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous is that the prior one illuminated how the *virtue/power*-embodied one attains *constancy*, while forcing *qi* for life deviates from the *Dao*. Thus, this chapter follows, revealing how the *virtue/power*-embodied one forgets speech, while those who force *qi* cling to teachings.\n\nThis chapter unfolds in four distinct teachings:\n1. It reveals the supreme *Dao* as empty and tranquil, transcending all names and words;\n2. It reveals the cessation of the mind’s fixations and gradual cultivation through stages;\n3. It aligns with worldly confusion yet corresponds to the *Dao*’s natural unfolding;\n4. It reveals the profound insight of those who defy convention and follow the *Dao*’s path, thus attaining eminence.\n\n**1. The supreme *Dao* is empty and tranquil, beyond all names and words.**\nThe Creator acts through effortless, heartless self-motion.\nThe Sage embodies *virtue/power* to complete the Great.\nConfucius’ words, though three feet long, were not profound.\nThe *Venerable Lord*’s heart serves the people as its master.\n\nThe celestial path is distant, yet one hears only the clamor of roosters and dogs.\nThe journey is boundless, yet only the sound of pipes and drums is heard.\n\nThe form is indistinct, speech cannot be known—\nthus Zhang Hua, though attending to the *Dao*, found it exhausting,\nand Sun Lin, though speaking of *Zhuangzi*’s teachings, could not harmonize them.\n\nTo speak is to deviate from the *Dao*;\nto act is to lose *True Constancy*.\nLi Lou sought pearls yet dove deeper into darkness,\nwhile Yi You played with pills and freed himself.\n\nThe *Venerable Lord*’s instruction seals the mouth and closes the gate:\n*\"The Sage does not speak*—there is good reason for this.»",

      "translated_text": "「The fourth section draws upon the Sage, revealing the beauty of *wuwei* [非作為, \"non-action\"]. Thus the Sage says: *\"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves;*\n*I do no work, and the people grow wealthy;*\n*I love tranquility, and the people become upright;*\n*I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"I act with non-action\"*—the Sage speaks of himself, for the Sage’s **virtue/power** [德] does not rely on clever stratagems. He embodies the essence of the Dao/Way, valuing *wuwei* [無為]. *Wuwei* means there is nothing to forbid or restrict; the Sage’s own *wuwei* [無為] allows the people to transform themselves accordingly.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** [河上公] says: *\"Thus the Sage speaks\"*—referring to matters below. *\"I act with non-action\"* means the Sage cultivates the Dao/Way and follows Heaven’s mandate, making no alterations, and yet the people transform themselves.\n\n**Master Rong** [荣] says: The preceding lines warn against four forms of *wei* [作為, \"artificial action\"]—the maladies of governance. Hence, the Sage prescribes four *wuwei* [無為] remedies to eliminate chaos and achieve transformation, to attain stillness by abandoning movement, to ensure domestic peace and cultural harmony, and to let things unfold naturally so that the people know contentment and grow wealthy, follow the Dao/Way without deviation and return to simplicity by discarding excess.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage’s **virtue/power** [德] is tranquil and detached, *wuwei* [無為]. Beneath him, the people abandon vice and embrace goodness. The Sage is indeed a Sage, yet he modestly attributes his teachings to other Sages, hence *Zhuangzi* [《莊子》] says: *\"My allegories are nineteen in number.\"* [寓言十九]\n\n*\"I do no work, and the people grow wealthy,\"*\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage’s heart is free from artificial action, and his governance is simple—each of the four classes [四民] pursues their respective occupations, the six directions [六合] aligned in harmony, with lightened burdens and sparse taxation. If not for this, what would make the people wealthy?\n\n*\"I love tranquility, and the people become upright,\"*\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Sage above embraces stillness, not troubling the people, so they inherit the pure winds of nature and naturally return to the upright path.\n\n*\"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWhen the Sage above has few desires and little selfishness, maintains purity and simplicity, the people know contentment and abide by their proper roles, returning to simplicity.\n\nThe following lines all elucidate the meaning of *taking the world without action* [無事取天下].\n\n**Chapter 58: \"His Governance is Obscure and Obscure\"**\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous one is that the prior chapter expounds upon the Sage who follows the Dao/Way and governs through *wuwei* [無為], while the unrighteous ruler multiplies laws and decrees. Thus, this chapter broadens the discussion: the governance of the Daoist Sage is obscure and effortless, while that of the unrighteous is meticulous and invasive. The meaning flows in continuity, hence its placement.\n\nThis chapter is divided into four distinct sections. The first distinguishes between two forms of governance—lenient and harsh—and their differing effects. The second contrasts the two outcomes of governance—calamity and blessing—showing their unpredictability. The third laments the prolonged ignorance of ordinary beings, not limited to this life alone. The fourth illustrates the Sage’s transcendence of merit, concealing his light and brilliance.\n\n**First Section: Distinguishing Lenient and Harsh Governance, Their Different Effects.**\nIt is said that Yao opened the Four Gates [四門], and the people rejoiced in the *jiren* [擊壤] song of contentment. Qin unified the hundred districts [百郡], yet the nation became a ruin, its people suffering calamity. Thus one knows that governance and teaching lie in simplicity and naturalness—why must they be meticulously enforced? Hence, when Jin Wu became Emperor, he burned the *Zhitou* [雉頭] tax records to restore harmony, and when Shi Qing served as a minister, he counted only the horses to uphold integrity. The Sage’s heart is empty, aligning with the Dao/Way, and even snoring can yield pearls. The rigid ruler loses his life by clinging to his intentions, as Jing Ke did by returning his sword. The outcomes of calamity and blessing—are they not thus determined?\n\n**Lamenting the Prolonged Ignorance of Heaven’s Sentient Beings:**\nThe days of their delusion are indeed long. The sorrow of hell’s torments, yet their heads still gather there. The joy of heaven’s paradise, yet their hearts depart and do not ascend. Only when they are at their wits’ end do they wag their tails in submission—how wretched is their plight! When suffering comes, they begin to strike their heads in repentance—what use is regret then? Strive to reflect and awaken, and cast off the shackles of this mortal coil!\n\n**His governance is obscure and obscure, his people are pure and pure.**\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nGovernance that is obscure and obscure—*wuwei* [無為] and lenient—leads the people to respond with natural purity and simplicity.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nObscure and obscure [闷闷]—lenient and expansive. Pure and pure [淳淳]—simple and sincere. The Sage above governs through *wuwei* [無為], and his policies are lenient and expansive, so the people beneath him follow and become pure and simple.\n\n**His governance is meticulous and meticulous, his people are deficient and deficient.**\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nGovernance that is meticulous and meticulous—*wei* [作為] and harsh—leads the people to respond with deficiency and decay.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nMeticulous and meticulous [察察]—*wei* [作為] and strict. The governance of the Sage is lenient and expansive, allowing things to unfold naturally. Since there is no cruelty, the people’s customs become pure and simple. His governance is meticulous and invasive, yet the people grow deficient and exhausted.",
      "overlap_context": "* are akin to *\"laws and decrees.\"*\nWhen legal statutes and punishments are prominently displayed,\nlaws and decrees grow ever more numerous—\ncloth woven with fat, armor that cannot be pierced from three sides,\npeople cannot endure such oppressive measures—\nthose who flee become many,\nand reckless thefts arise—\nthus thieves and robbers proliferate.\nAs the governance grows ever more intricate,\nthe people’s evasion becomes ever more concealed.\nThis sentence again elucidates governance through laws.",

The ruling lord who acts (*youwei*), whose governance is stern and urgent, who binds people with laws, whose decrees proliferate—then thieves and bandits multiply, and the people wither and scatter.\n\n**River Upper Master** said: His governance is meticulous and urgent—words spoken in haste, ears straining to listen. His people are deficient and deficient—governance is urgent and harsh, the people cannot sustain life, so they grow ever more sparse and thin.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*察察*—stern and swift. *缺缺*—scattered and ruined. The ruler favors action, governs with haste, and the people suffer under his tyranny, thus they scatter.\n\n**On governing oneself**, one should also cultivate emptiness, forgetfulness, and leniency—never clinging to a hasty or rigid heart.\n\n---\n**Second: The Two Disciples of Calamity and Fortune—leaning and hidden, without fixed end.**\n\nCalamity! Fortune leans upon it.\nFortune! Calamity hides within it.\nWho knows its ultimate measure?\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*倚*—rooted in. *伏*—concealed. Earlier, it spoke of lenient governance, yet the people deemed it lacking in order, yet became pure and simple—this is calamity giving rise to fortune. Stern governance, yet the people saw it as virtuous governance unfolding, yet they withered and scattered—this is fortune concealing calamity.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nCalamity! Fortune leans upon it—earlier, it spoke of lenient governance, which the people took as evil, yet they became pure and sincere—how is this not fortune arising from calamity? Fortune! Calamity hides within it—*伏*, concealed. Stern governance, which the people took as good, yet things decayed and scattered—how is this not calamity hidden within fortune, ready to emerge? Who knows its ultimate measure? Those who lose the Dao and abandon virtue, indulging in deceit and superficiality—thus calamity and fortune cycle, leaning and hidden without fixed rule. Who can know their true end?\n\n**River Upper Master** said: Calamity! Fortune leans upon it—*倚*, rooted in. Fortune arises from calamity: when people face calamity and repent, take responsibility, cultivate goodness, and follow the Way, then calamity departs and fortune arrives. Fortune! Calamity hides within it—calamity lurks within fortune. When people obtain fortune yet grow arrogant and licentious, then fortune departs and calamity comes. Who knows its ultimate measure? Calamity and fortune generate each other endlessly; none can fathom their final limit.\n\n**Master Yan** said: Fortune arises from calamity, calamity from fortune. Calamity and fortune, though distinct, share the same root—thus abandoning fortune means no calamity, no calamity means no fortune. Fortune without fortune is the most subtle and profound; none in the world can exhaust its depths.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nCalamity! Fortune leans upon it. Fortune! Calamity hides within it. *倚*—rooted in. *伏*—concealed. Lenient governance brings fortune; stern governance invites calamity. These two matters stem from the same heart—fortune leans upon calamity, calamity hides within fortune; their principle is not distant. Who knows its ultimate measure? Its standard is unclear. *孰*—who. The signs of calamity and fortune arise from good and evil; since deeds are unstable, so too are their rewards. Thus they cycle through the Three Realms, return to the Six Paths, in myriad transformations—who can know their end?\n\nOnly the superior sage, forgetting self to aid others, embodying this true Dao, awakening to the Profound Mystery—unmoved by the causes of good and evil—thus escapes calamity and fortune’s reach. As *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Calamity does not arrive, fortune does not come.\nCalamity and fortune are nonexistent—who would suffer disaster?\"*\n\nThus they turn endlessly without end—because they do not uphold the true Dao.\n\n---\n**Third: Lamenting the long-deluded common folk—this is not merely of this life.**\n\nIs there no true principle?\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\nIs there no true principle? What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous. The extremes of calamity and fortune—is there truly no principle? Yet sentient beings cling to delusion, deeming the true as deceitful, the good as portents of ill—thus calamity and fortune lean and hide, as if no principle exists.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis speaks of the extremes of calamity and fortune—is there truly no fixed principle? Yet because people cannot embody the Dao of *wuwei*, they generate delusion, losing the true principle.\n\n**River Upper Master** said: *无*—not. The ruler does not rectify himself—then there is no state.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nIs there no true principle? What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous. *奇*—strange, *妖*—evil. The deeds of good and evil returning—this is all as it should be. The silent, solitary true principle alone is true. Most accumulate filth, few have purity—thus it is said there is no true principle. Those who follow evil are many; those who follow the true are few. Even if one acts rightly, the true is not always true—suddenly it shifts, thus it is called strange. All commit evil, unwilling to do good—even if one acts well, goodness does not endure, soon returning to evil, thus it is called ominous. What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis explains the source of deluded principle. Sentient beings are confused about the true principle of calamity and fortune—unaware of the true, they deem it deceitful; unenlightened to goodness, they call it an omen. Thus it seems as if there is no true principle.\n\n**River Upper Master** said: What is true becomes strange—*奇*, deceit.

They cultivate within themselves, and the world naturally follows suit.\n\n「圣人善化，不割彼而为方，不秽彼而为康，不申彼而为直，不耀彼而为光，修之身而天下自化矣。」\nThe Sage’s transformative power is gentle—never cutting to impose squareness, never defiling to bring purity, never asserting to enforce honesty, nor dazzling to manifest brightness. They refine within themselves, and the world spontaneously aligns.\n\n「○御疏：方，正也。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Fang*, means upright.\n\n「举圣德以劝修，圣人弘道济世，示物向方，身行方正，物则应之而自正，非立言教裁割於物使从己也。」\nThe Sage’s virtue is held up to encourage cultivation. The Sage expounds the Dao/Way and aids the world, guiding all toward rectitude. Their own conduct is upright, and things respond accordingly, becoming upright themselves—never imposing rigid teachings or cutting others to force compliance.\n\n「○河上公曰：圣人行方正者，欲以率下，不以割截人也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: The Sage acts with uprightness to lead the people below, never to cut or constrain them.\n\n「○荣曰：方，正也，割，伤也，邪行则物我俱伤，正道则彼此无割。」\n**Master Rong** said: *Fang* means upright; *ge* means harm. When vice prevails, both self and others are harmed. Yet in true principle, there is no mutual injury.\n\n「廉而不秽，\nPure yet not defiled—\n\n「○御疏：廉，清也。秽，浊也。圣人率性清康，自然化下，非秽彼之浊以扬其清。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Lian* means purity; *hui* means turbidity. The Sage follows their natural purity, effortlessly transforming the world below—never defiling others to elevate their own clarity.\n\n「有本为创字者，创，伤也，圣人康以成行，不伤於物。」\nOriginally, *hui* was written as *chuang* (创), meaning harm. The Sage’s purity completes their conduct without harming others.\n\n「○河上公曰：圣人康清欲以化民，不以伤害人也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: The Sage’s purity aims to transform the people, never to harm them.\n\n「今则不然，正己以害人也。」\nNow it is otherwise: one rectifies themselves to harm others.\n\n「○荣曰：凡情贪而浊，圣道康而清。」\n**Master Rong** said: Common desires are greedy and turbid, while the Sage’s path is pure and clear.\n\n「○成疏：妙体物境也空幻，无可贪取，非关卓尔清康，避世之秽，斯则净秽双遣，责康两忘，不康而康，秽而不秽，故《庄子》云：大康不嗛，又云：廉清不信。」\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** The profound nature of all phenomena is empty and illusory—nothing to covet. This is not about standing out in purity or avoiding the world’s turbidity. Rather, it transcends both defilement and purity, casting off all dualistic notions of praise or blame, neither clinging to purity nor being bound by defilement. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Great purity is not rigid\"* and *\"Purity and clarity are not trusted.\"* (Note: *信* here as *trustworthy* in the sense of being rigid or dogmatic.)\n\n「直而不肆，\nHonest yet not self-righteous—\n\n「○御疏：肆，申也。圣人之行不邪，彼自从而正直，非为彼之不正，而申直以正曲也。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Shi* (肆) means to assert. The Sage’s conduct is never crooked—others follow naturally, becoming upright. It is not about correcting others’ crookedness by forcing honesty upon them.\n\n「○河上公曰：肆，申也，圣人虽直，曲己从人，不自申也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: *Shi* means to assert. Though the Sage is honest, they bend to follow others, never asserting themselves.\n\n「○荣曰：大直若届，不显正以示人。」\n**Master Rong** said: Great honesty seems to yield—never flaunting uprightness to show others.\n\n「○成疏：肆，申也。素质雅正，体无邪谄，而曲从於物，不申己直，故前章云大直若屈也。」\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** *Shi* means to assert. The Sage’s innate nature is upright, their being free of deceit or flattery, yet they bend to follow things without asserting their own honesty. Hence, the previous chapter says: *\"Great honesty seems to bow.\"*\n\n「光而不耀。」\nBrilliant yet not dazzling.\n\n「○御疏：光者谓明智也，圣人虽有明智而韬晦之，不以炫耀，故云光而不耀。」\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *Guang* refers to wisdom and clarity. Though the Sage possesses wisdom, they conceal it, never flaunting brilliance—thus it is said: *\"Brilliant yet not dazzling.\"*\n\n「圣德如此，自然百姓淳淳而从化也。」\nThe Sage’s virtue is thus: the people spontaneously become pure and follow transformation.\n\n「○河上公曰：圣人虽有独知之明，常如暗昧，不以耀乱人也。」\n**River Upper Master** said: Though the Sage possesses singular wisdom, they act as if in darkness, never dazzling others into confusion.\n\n「○荣曰：明道若昧也，前标得失之政，次指祸福之门，而没溺者既多，昏迷者已久，妖奇则系累之境，倚伏非悬解之场，是以康而不秽，始体清虚之道，光而不耀，方识慧源之路，冥得失，何祸何福乎，混是非，孰邪孰正乎，泛兮无系无不系，肃然无可无不可。」\n**Master Rong** said: The Sage’s clarity seems like obscurity. Though they reveal the principles of gain and loss, and the gates of calamity and fortune, many are drowned in ignorance, and many have been long in darkness. The strange and *miao* bind them in suffering, while dependence and subjugation offer no escape. Thus, purity without defilement begins with embodying the Dao of clarity and emptiness, brilliance without dazzle reveals the path of wisdom. In the depths of gain and loss, who knows of calamity or fortune? In the confusion of right and wrong, who discerns vice or virtue? Floating freely, neither bound nor unbound, solemn yet without constraint or possibility—*thus the Sage transcends all dualities.*",

The ruler does not rectify himself; though the people below may act rightly, they in turn corrupt the ruler’s sincerity.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one because, after clarifying the governance through the Dao to achieve purity and harmony, it further emphasizes governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses the application of the Dao.\n\nWithin this chapter, four teachings unfold:\n1. The first elucidates that governing the myriad people begins with the Dao.\n2. The second asserts that even when employing the Dao, one must accumulate virtue and amass deeds.\n3. The third reveals that such accumulation makes one a transformative sovereign.\n4. The fourth demonstrates that deep-rooted stability ensures enduring vision and longevity.\n\n**First: Governing the Myriad People Begins with the Dao.**\nThe Dao hangs like an empty vessel—yet those who deny it commit the greatest blasphemy. Virtue, when steadfast, becomes the fundamental principle for all.\n\nA ruler of a realm must walk in rectitude, then the lofty peaks of Emei will bow, winds will descend upon the Celestial Sovereign’s hall, and the mountains of Yangjiao will summon the Sage of Li. Is this not proof that virtue lies in early submission, and the Dao is thus revered? When royal edicts are issued, all obey without hesitation—no one is expelled for three offenses. Loyalty and filial piety are embraced, while the King of Yang’s stern commands are obeyed first. Even the wine pools of Zhao and Mozi’s chariot turn back—thus, rectitude is the foundation of the state, while deceit is the work of men. In governing both people and Heaven, nothing surpasses the Dao.\n\nTo employ the Dao is to govern with ease; deceit and chaos are difficult to rectify. Those with deep roots and firm foundations, who endure and thrive, rely externally on spoken teachings and internally cultivate serenity. They endure Heaven’s floods without drifting, withstand Earth’s flames without scorching—no one knows their limits, for such is the result of accumulated virtue.\n\n**Governing the People and Serving Heaven: Nothing Surpasses Frugality.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* Frugality means love.\n\nWhen a ruler seeks to govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality—ensuring granaries are full, people observe rites, and the three seasons bring no harm. Then Heaven will bestow blessings.\n\nHarmony among the people governs them; Heaven’s protection serves Heaven.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Frugality means love. The ruler who wishes to transform the people and revere Heaven must first practice frugality—frugality is the virtue of thrift. Thrift ensures sufficiency, gathering the people. Abundant offerings honor Heaven’s virtue, hence, nothing surpasses frugality.\n\n*River Above Master (严君平)*: Governing people means the ruler harmonizes the populace. Serving Heaven means employing Heaven’s ways, aligning with the four seasons. Nothing surpasses frugality—frugality is thrift. Governing a state requires cherishing the people’s wealth, avoiding extravagance. Governing oneself means cherishing one’s vital essence, avoiding dissipation.\n\n*Li Rong (李荣)*: To govern below and serve above, nothing exceeds using the Dao as the standard.\n\n*Master Cheng (成玄英)*: Heaven is nature; the standard is law. Nothing surpasses means there is no better way. The ruler who harmonizes with Heaven’s ways and transforms the common folk does so by employing the law of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n**Only frugality is called early submission.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* How does one gather the people? Through wealth—when a ruler practices frugality, people from all directions will bring tribute, submitting early to their lord.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Only frugality*—repeating the earlier phrase. Thus, early submission explains the meaning of frugality. In all seven transformations, the meaning follows this pattern. *Only* is an introductory phrase. *Submission* means service. Only a ruler who restrains and cherishes will govern people and serve Heaven through frugality, and thus all under Heaven will submit early.\n\n*River Above Master:* Early means prior; submission means virtue. The ruler who cherishes the people’s wealth and vital essence will first attain Heaven’s ways.\n\n*Li Rong:* Using the Dao as the standard, all things will naturally converge.\n\n*Master Cheng:* This *wuwei* law alone benefits both self and others. Applied to governing the body, it subdues all demons and trials; applied to governing the state, it draws distant lands into submission.\n\n**Second: Even When Employing the Dao, One Must Accumulate Virtue and Amass Deeds.**\nEarly submission is called *accumulating virtue*.\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* The ruler who practices frugality thus accumulates virtue, and the people, drawn to virtue, submit early to their lord—hence, *accumulating virtue*.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Why does all under Heaven revere and submit? Because of practiced frugality—frugality ensures the people submit early, thus virtue is deeply accumulated.\n\n*River Above Master:* Attaining Heaven’s ways first is called accumulating virtue for oneself.\n\n*Li Rong:* The Dao is light, virtue shallow—people will not submit. When virtue is deeply accumulated, all things will naturally submit.\n\n*Master Cheng:* *Accumulating* means deep accumulation; *virtue* means layered virtue. This speaks to those who internally subdue demons and externally pacify distant lands—one must accumulate deeds, making virtue profound before distant lands submit.\n\n**Accumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquered.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* The Sage accumulates virtue, and all under Heaven turns to benevolence—nothing remains unconquered.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* *Conquered* means ability. If a ruler deeply accumulates virtue, his governance will preserve all human strength, and his service to Heaven will bring unending good fortune. Thus, all under Heaven will submit, and nothing will remain unconquered.\n\n*River Above Master:* *Conquered* means subdued. Deeply accumulating virtue ensures nothing resists.\n\n*Li Rong:* Profound virtue and deep benevolence ensure nothing is unconquered.\n\n*Master Cheng:* *Conquered* means both subdued and attained. Accumulating deeds makes virtue profound, benefiting both self and others without loss. Internally and externally subdued, nothing remains unconquered.\n\n**Nothing is unconquered, thus no limits are known.**\n*Imperial Commentary:* A ruler’s virtue knows no inability to govern—thus, its reach is boundless, and all under Heaven knows no extremity.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* This means a ruler’s virtue knows no inability to subdue—thus, distant peoples admire and submit, and no land remains untouched. Hence, no limits are known.",

Virtue and power stretch boundless, none able to fathom their limits.\n\n**Third, it illustrates that by accumulating deeds and amassing merit, one may become the master of transformation.**\n\nIf no limits are known, then one may have a realm.\n*Imperial Commentary:* Only when none know the limits of one’s virtue can one truly be said to have a realm.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* It speaks of a ruler whose transforming virtue reaches everywhere, whose merit draws all people, whose divine favor is ever bestowed—thus may one be called as having a realm. Beyond this, how could one claim to have a realm?\n\n*River Above Master:* If none know the limits of one’s own virtue, then one may establish the ancestral altars and bring blessings to the people.\n\n*Li Rong (荣) says:* Lands are boundless, virtue and power know no end—only then may one truly have a realm.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* Since principle knows no discord and virtue stretches boundless, one may thus have a realm to govern and transform the people, becoming a sovereign or a master of transformation.\n\n**The mother of having a realm is what makes it enduring.**\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* A realm that nurtures its people well will endure in blessings and longevity.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* \"Mother\" refers to the Dao, with nurturing as its meaning. Only because of the Dao may one be called as having a realm, and if one nurtures the common folk as such, blessings and longevity will flourish eternally, making it enduring.\n\n*River Above Master:* A realm and its ruler are one in essence; \"mother\" is the Dao. If one can preserve the Dao within oneself, ensuring one’s *qi* is not exhausted and the five spirits are not strained, then one may endure.\n\n*Li Rong (荣) says:* With the Dao, a realm is secure; without it, a realm is in peril. A realm arises from the Dao, and the Dao is the realm’s mother. To take the Dao as mother is why one may endure.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* The Conqueror-King (霸王) and the Dragon-King (龙成) say: Since they are rulers and sovereigns, nurturing the common folk like their own children, they are thus called \"mother.\" Though their virtue and deeds are lofty, they do not cling to action or empty detachment—thus they may endure.\n\n**Fourth, it illustrates deep-rooted stability and lasting vision.**\n\nThis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.\n\n*Imperial Commentary:* Accumulating virtue to have a realm makes its roots deep and its foundation firm. The deep and firm is the Dao of enduring life and lasting vision.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* A ruler who accumulates virtue takes the Dao as their realm, and thus may endure. Hence, the analogy of roots and foundation is invoked to clarify its meaning. The \"foundation\" (蒂) is like the stalk of a flower. Just as plants with deep roots flourish and firm stalks do not fall, so too is their enduring nature. It likens a ruler who accumulates virtue, planting their roots in the Dao and securing their foundation in virtue—extending life is called enduring life, and constant illumination is called lasting vision. Thus, it is the Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.\n\n*River Above Master:* This is the Dao of deep-rooted stability. If one can take *qi* as root and essence as foundation, like a tree whose roots are not deep and will be uprooted, or whose stalk is not firm and will fall—one must deeply conceal their *qi* and firmly guard their essence, not allowing it to leak away. The Dao of enduring life and lasting vision is that of deep-rooted stability.\n\n*Li Rong (荣) says:* If roots rot, the stalk collapses; if the foundation decays, the stalk falls. Now, to govern with the Dao as root makes it deep, and to cultivate oneself with virtue as foundation makes it firm. A firm foundation brings enduring life, deep roots bring lasting vision—this is the pattern of heaven and humanity, the essentials of family and realm.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* Root is origin. Foundation is the manifestation. The root can generate the foundation, likening how origin can produce traces. The traces are called deep-rooted, and the origin is called firm-foundation. If roots are not deep, they will topple; if the foundation is not firm, it will crumble. Only because of deep roots does one endure life, and only because of a firm foundation does one attain lasting vision. This shows that the sage who has a realm possesses both origin and traces in perfection, hence the text says: \"The Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.\"\n\n**Vision is illumination.**\n\n*Chapter on Governing Great Realms, Chapter Sixty*\nThe chapter on governing great realms follows the previous one, for the prior chapter illustrates that if one aligns with the Dao in frugality and love, all affairs will be swiftly subdued, while this chapter shows that if one does not disturb the already subdued, then virtue will be mutually returned.\n\nThe text is divided into three parts: the first introduces the analogy of governing with the Dao, emphasizing non-action; the second shows that virtue benefits both people and spirits, causing no harm; the third concludes with praise for the mutual return of virtue, urging rulers who have realms.\n\n**First, it introduces the analogy of governing with the Dao, emphasizing non-action.**\n\nFor it is heard that the ruler is the primary leader—\nHolding the Dao in silence and facing the people, ministers serve as limbs and sinews, adjusting the transformations of yin and yang to regulate affairs. The Bear and the Tiger bow in submission, while the lower immortals ascend their halls to set the winds in motion. Sometimes wild geese fly into the court, or celestial dragons descend upon the thoroughfares, startling the world with transformation. All desire to engage in non-action, to settle the restless heart, to move like the deer that tames itself, to govern with such precision that the smallest fish cannot be harmed, and to ensure the four quarters find their place while the people all dwell in peace.\n\nYet, as seen in Ximen Bao’s lack of benevolence, drowning widows was excessive. As seen in Jiang Ziya’s embrace of virtue, the spirit maiden wept in the courtyard, and he transformed the chaotic customs like untying a knot, and his governance was as refined as weaving silk. Then, heads bowed in reverence as heaven took notice, stubborn necks submitted to human authority, fires were extinguished in Jiangling, and strange apparitions vanished in the cities. Ghosts did not bring calamity, spirits suffered no harm—thus virtue was mutually returned, and the world looked up to the pure and upright example.\n\n**To govern a great realm is like to cook a small fish.**\n\n*Imperial Exegesis:* Cooking means boiling. A small fish is a small fish. If one cooks a small fish improperly, it will break apart. It likens governing a great realm: if one troubles the people, they will fall into disorder. All must rely on the Dao to achieve success.",

      "translated_text": "「The second elucidates virtue/power and the relationship with ghosts and spirits—both without harm. Those who spread the Dao across the world will find their ghosts unspirited.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:** Governing a realm with excess troubles the populace, leading to chaos; refining oneself with excess troubles the spirit, causing it to scatter. When one spreads the Dao across the world, the ghosts remain unspirited. *Yi* means \"to use\"; *ling* means \"to manifest.\"\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Ghosts and spirits manifest in seclusion as the forces of the unseen. The term *lingxiao* (灵效) refers to their efficacy. When humans have desires, the spirits respond. Yet under the transformation of supreme virtue/power, people dwell in natural ease—how could it be only that the sovereign forgets the might of the spirits, but also that they do not rely on supplication? Thus, the ghosts in seclusion lack the means to manifest their efficacy.\n\nIt is not that these ghosts are unspirited, but that the spirits do not harm the people. **Imperial Exegesis:** When ghosts manifest monstrously, they harm people; when the sage acts, they harm people. Now, the reason ghosts do not manifest monstrously nor harm people is that the sage abides in non-action and tranquility.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** The saying that spirits do not harm people—does it mean only that spirits lack efficacy and cannot harm people? Rather, the sage governs with the Dao, causing no disturbance; the populace naturally aligns with righteousness. Hence, the sage also does not harm people. Then, the reason ghosts and spirits cannot manifest monstrously nor harm people is that the sage spreads the Dao across the world. To further clarify the sage’s virtue/power, it is repeated that the sage also does not harm people.\n\n**River Above Master (河上公):** It is not that ghosts and spirits cannot harm people; rather, when the sage holds office, they do not dare to interfere, for the sage does not harm people.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:** These ghosts and spirits cannot harm people, but when the sage presides above, virtue/power extends to both the seen and unseen, and ghosts and spirits cause no harm—because the sage does not harm.\n\nThey can also benefit the people, and thus they themselves do not harm.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** All versions write *yi* (亦), but only Zhang Xishan (张系师) and Lu Xiansheng (陆先生) use *zhi* (之). Since *zhi* and *yi* are similar in form, scribes mistakenly wrote *yi*. Now, we adopt *zhi* as correct. It means that these ghosts do not harm the people, but rather, it is because the sage governs the world with the Dao, subduing evil and wickedness, that the ghosts no longer harm people. The power lies in the sage’s governance, hence the saying that the sage does not harm people.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis (治身者):** When refining oneself, it is not that stirring the heart cannot harm conduct—rather, the sage’s wisdom suppresses and controls such stirrings, so even if the heart moves, it cannot harm the stillness. Thus, the inner and outer conduct both return to the self.\n\nIf one is both still and in motion, what is being suppressed? Now, it is clarified that suppression occurs even when there is no suppression, and response occurs even when there is no response—meaning that the response arises naturally.\n\n**The Third: Seclusion and Manifestation Observe Their Boundaries, Virtue and Wisdom Return Together.**\nSince both do not harm each other, virtue/power is mutually returned.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** When ghosts and spirits harm people, it harms the realm and depletes its foundation; when the sage harms people, it exhausts the spirit and lacks reverence. Now, since neither harms the other, virtue/power is mutually returned.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** The two refer to the sage and the spirits. Humans are the foundation of the realm and also the master of the spirits. If ghosts and spirits harm people, it harms the realm’s foundation; if the sage harms people, it exhausts the spirit’s master. Now, since neither harms the other, virtue/power is mutually returned. Not only do the spirits and sage flourish alone, but all people also rely on this. **River Above Master:** Since both do not harm each other—the ghosts and the sage—virtue/power is mutually returned. When both do not harm each other, the people are governed in the seen, the ghosts in the unseen; the people preserve their lives, the ghosts safeguard their spirits, hence virtue/power is mutually returned.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:** Ghosts, spirits, and the sage—these are the two. Both can benefit the people without harm. The sage is compassionate and kind, the ghosts and spirits are upright and just; compassion and kindness manifest in the seen and shine brightly, while uprightness and justice dwell in the unseen and quietly accumulate. Both bestow virtue/power and blessings upon the people, thus virtue/power and wisdom return together.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** The two refer to ghosts dwelling in the unseen and humans in the seen. Seclusion and manifestation each find their place, without mutual harm. Then, humans bestow virtue/power upon ghosts, and ghosts repay with blessings—virtue and kindness flow in return, hence they mutually adhere.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis (治身者):** Refining oneself means suppressing agitation to return to stillness, thus perfecting one’s conduct. From stillness arises motion, to respond to the myriad people; motion does not contradict stillness, hence there is no harm. This is why inner and outer conduct both return to the self.\n\n**The Great Realm Chapter: Chapter Sixty-One**\nThe *Great Realm* chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter elucidates the use of the Dao and non-action in subduing and testing malevolent forces. Thus, this chapter follows, clarifying the use of the Dao in dealing with people while maintaining the power of humility and harmony.\n\nThis chapter opens three distinct meanings:\n1. It elucidates dealing with people through humility and harmony, using stillness to suppress agitation;\n2. It elucidates the small and great observing their boundaries, each possessing their own yielding and firm qualities;\n3. It elucidates restraining the high and proud to extinguish their arrogance and ambition.",

      "translated_text": "「The First Meaning: Dealing with Others in Humility and Harmony, Using Stillness to Suppress Agitation\nThe myriad rivers converge at the sea, the Four Great Elements[注: *四大*, the classical Buddhist elements of earth, water, fire, and wind] in their majesty are called *King*[注: *王*, here symbolizing supreme authority]. The King, though solitary and exalted, is said to be *Na-Guo*[注: *孤寡*, a term of self-effacement], while the sea, in its boundless embrace, attains greatness. Thus, one knows that mountains, though steep and towering, further enhance the earth’s lowly and yielding nature, while the sea’s virtue is vast and deep, gathering all rivers into its embrace. The lowly flow receives the multitude, the humble retreat becomes the object of reverence. Zi Gong borrowed horses and never returned them, while Liu Kuang begged for a cow before sending one in return—both acts stemmed from minds untroubled by ambition, their wills aligned with yielding and harmony. Small states thus find attachment through submission, while great states are enriched by acts of deference and self-restraint. To hold victory in strength is to err; words that do not align with this principle are flawed. The virtuous of later ages may follow this intent.\n\nThe great state is the lowly confluence, the meeting place of all under heaven.\n\n**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**\nThe lowly confluence is the virtue of humility.\n\nThe great state must open itself in humility and embrace others, thus becoming the meeting place of all under heaven.\n\n**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**\nThe rivers and streams descend to the sea, and all converge there—hence, the term *lowly confluence*. This humility in bestowing upon others is the virtue of humility.\n\nThe ruler of a state, if he follows the Dao, preserves his realm; if he lacks virtue, his people scatter. Thus, the great state must open itself in humility and embrace others, allowing all under heaven to gather and meet, thereby securing its grandeur—hence, the saying: *The great state is the lowly confluence, the meeting place of all under heaven*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe great state is the lowly confluence—one must govern a great state as though dwelling in the lowly confluence, not resisting the smallest currents. The meeting place of all under heaven is where the people of the world gather.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe great state is vast in territory; with the Dao, it is steadfast as a *Pan Shi*[注: *盘石*, a massive, unyielding rock], secure as *Tai Shan*[注: *泰山*, Mount Tai, symbolizing stability]. Without the Dao, it is perilous as a *Lei Mao*[注: *累卯*, a pile of unstable stones], lighter than a *Hong Mao*[注: *鸿毛*, feather]. It should not arrogantly exalt itself.\n\n**Rong says:**\n*Exchange* means *convergence*. The sea lies beneath all currents, and rivers thus gather there. Likewise, the ruler of a great state, in self-perception, must regard himself as deficient, so that all states may unite in reverence.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe great state is a realm of *Ten Thousand Chariots*[注: *万乘*, a state with vast military resources]. *Confluence* refers to the outer suburbs[注: *郊郭*, outskirts or borders]. *The* means *to go*. The great state, in its magnanimity, is like the rivers and seas, receiving all currents beneath it—thus, all states vie to pour their tribute. The great state, through its Dao of humility and harmony, gathers all realms, near and far, in allegiance, filling its borders with those who follow its virtue. The term *exchange* here also refers to the great state’s humility, enabling its convergence with smaller states.\n\nThe meeting place of all under heaven is *feminine*—for the feminine always triumphs through stillness over the masculine.\n\n**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**\nThe people of the world gather because they are drawn to the great state’s humility, just as the feminine, through its yielding stillness, is always sought by the restless masculine—hence, stillness is the path of humility.\n\n**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**\nThe term *meeting place of all under heaven* echoes earlier passages, reinforcing the meaning of *lowly confluence*. It states that the people of the world gather because the ruler of the great state employs the Dao of humility, allowing the feminine to prevail in its yielding stillness, which is why it is sought by the restless masculine—hence, *the feminine always triumphs through stillness over the masculine*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe feminine Dao of the great state is rooted in still humility. The feminine bends the masculine, and yin overcomes yang, for it remains tranquil and does not seek first.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe feminine is yielding and still, the masculine is forceful and restless. Stillness can govern restlessness, yin can bend yang—thus, one knows that humility subdues arrogance, and weakness overcomes strength. Stillness is the path of humility.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe term *meeting place of all under heaven* reiterates the earlier passage. The feminine is yielding and still, the masculine is forceful and restless. The great state’s ability to make all states submit and converge lies in its constant use of humility and yielding stillness, thereby triumphing over forceful restlessness. If it were to employ force and restlessness, it would fail to attract them. Thus, one knows that governing oneself and one’s state must begin with yielding and harmony.\n\nThe Second Meaning: Small and Great States Observe Their Boundaries, Each Employing Their Own Yielding and Firm Qualities.\nThus, the great state submits to the small state and takes from it;\n**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**\nThe great takes from the small, making them subjects.\n\nThe small takes from the great, seeking aid.\n\n**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**\n*Thus* follows the preceding passage, reinforcing its meaning. The ruler of the great state does not rely on coercion but on the virtue of humility to gently subdue others, intending to draw in the rulers of smaller states, taking their people as subjects.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nIf one can practice humility, it will always endure. Thus, there will be no faults.\n\n**Rong says:**\nHumility as virtue can contain others; if one cannot yet be humble and yielding, they cannot gather or be taken.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\n*With* means *to employ*; *humility* means *yielding deference*; *taking* means *to transform and assimilate*. The Sage-ruler, when presiding over a great state, skillfully employs humility and harmony, thereby transforming and assimilating all realms, near and distant, into submission. Is this not fitting?\n\nThe small state submits to the great state and takes from it;\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe great state’s ruler, having employed the Dao of humility to gently subdue the small state, sees the small state’s ruler offering tribute, attending court, and forming alliances, never daring to rebel. The small state’s ruler, in his yielding deference, seeks the great state’s protection as aid.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThis says that states have no small or great—if one can hold humility and gather others, there will be no faults.\n\n**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**\nThe small state, knowing its own humility, observes its boundaries, yielding and gathering within the great state’s embrace, following its virtue and revering its customs.»",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, sometimes one yields to take, and sometimes one yields while taking. **Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** *Yielding to take* refers to the great state subduing the small; *yielding while taking* refers to the small state submitting to the great.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Exegesis:**\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *\"When a teacher can command both left and right, it is called 'yielding to take.'\"*\nWhen one yields to take, it means the great state employs the Dao of humility to subdue the small state, thereby making its ruler compliant—able to be swayed either left or right. Hence, it is called *yielding to take*.\nWhen one yields while taking, it means the small state employs the Dao of humility to submit to the great state, only seeking to pay tribute and receive aid, unable to command its own left and right at will. Hence, it is called *yielding while taking*.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nYielding means the great state yields to the small state, and the small state yields to the great state, taking turns in offering virtue and deference.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThis is about uniting two states.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nSometimes, the small state uses softness and thus takes from the great state; sometimes, the great state uses humility and thus earns the favor of all states. The use of humility unites them, but the act of taking separates them—hence the word *sometimes*.\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others, while the small state seeks only to enter and serve others. **Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** The great state, when employing humility to subdue the small state, seeks only to encompass and nurture the small state’s people as subjects. The small state, when offering tribute and paying homage to the great state, seeks only to enter and serve the great state for aid.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWhen the great state uses humility to subdue the small state, it has no ulterior motive—only to encompass and nurture the small state’s people as its ruler. When the small state uses humility to seek the great state’s favor, it has no other intention—only to enter and serve the great state, relying on it for aid.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others, so it must not be lost—thus it annexes and shepherds smaller states. The small state seeks only to enter and serve others, becoming their subjects and servants.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe great state must spread its influence far and wide, embodying the august virtue of the sovereign. The small state must only reverence the Dao’s transformation, seeking to submit within its boundaries. Both fulfill their aspirations, yet the great state should especially practice humility.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe two states—great and small—each seek their own desires: the great state to encompass and nurture, the small state to enter and serve. Though both employ softness and humility, the great state should particularly practice humility, for things are never lightened by the small but always oppressed by the great. Thus, the great state is commanded to yield, embodying the meaning of *\"the high should be restrained.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao/Way as Chapter**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded on guarding stillness, practicing humility, and employing the Dao in interactions. Hence, this chapter reveals the Dao’s profound essence, guiding all things to return in dependence.\n\nThis chapter unfolds four distinct themes:\n1. The Dao’s ability to embrace all, urging beings to cherish it;\n2. Its refusal to abandon the lowly, perpetually extending great compassion;\n3. Its discernment of advantage and harm, clarifying victory and defeat;\n4. Its hypothetical questions, praising the Dao’s transformative power.\n\n---\n**First: The Dao’s Ability to Embrace All, Urging Beings to Cherish It**\nThe great Dao is without partiality, the supreme mystery that encompasses all. Its divine power is unending, a treasure for those who recognize goodness. It stands beyond the golden gates, transcending the iron barriers, descending to the humble and nourishing them, even as they float on a fleeting life. It dwells in the boundless, yet remains serene in its origin, its song eternal and its harmony everlasting. Within the lion’s throne, fierce beasts gather, yet when the moment arises, they act in accordance. When the opportunity fades, they forget. The heart wanders freely in the pool of liberation, riding the vessel of compassion to save all beings.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established, the Three Dukes appointed, the four steeds of black and white dismissed, and a single carriage alone is used for progress. The adornments of jade and the rituals of obeisance—how vast are they! Yet none surpass the virtue of urging all to follow this Dao, ever increasing.\n\nThe Dao is the supreme mystery of all things.\n**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** All things draw their origin from the wondrous source; this is the place from which they derive sustenance. Hence, it is called the supreme mystery of all things.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Dao is another name for the wondrous source. *Mystery* means *inner*—the Dao contains all without exclusion, the origin from which all things arise. Hence, it is called the supreme mystery of all things. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: *\"The Dao is profound and mysterious, the fountain of emptiness and nothingness\"*—this is what is meant.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*Mystery* means *hidden*—the Dao is the hidden treasure of all things, containing all without exception.\n\n**Master Yan says:**\nAll things take form from Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth arise from the formless. The Dao, through the formless form, opens the void, guides divine illumination, unites Heaven and Earth, penetrates yin and yang, flows through the four seasons, and governs the myriad regions. Though shapes and kinds differ, all are able to manifest and transform. It governs the eternal cycle of change, yet remains without constant, without favor or aversion—harmonizing with all things in great unity.",

      "translated_text": "**Master Rong says:**\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things, the precious treasure of the virtuous, and the refuge of the unvirtuous. Treasure means weighty—though the Dao is formless in its root, its principle is purely empty and still. Yet it enfolds the formless within manifest symbols, and receives the empty and still into the movements of living beings. Thus it is called the hidden essence of all things.\n\nThe refined and upright, with their rectitude, can hold fast to the true. The base and foolish, entangled in perversity, scorn the Dao. Hence there are those who treasure it and those who do not.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:**\nThe Dao is the wondrous principle of boundless emptiness, the innate nature of all sentient beings. Hidden means profound and secret, also the repository of treasures. The Dao can generate all existence, encompassing the myriad spirits, with nothing it does not contain. Thus it is the repository and hidden treasure of all things.\n\nThe precious treasure of the virtuous.\n**Imperial Commentary:** The virtuous know that those who uphold the Dao flourish, while those who abandon it perish. Therefore, they always cherish and value it, without ever neglecting it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Treasure means precious and valuable. The virtuous, being in accord with the Dao and practicing non-action, maintain purity in body and mind. Thus they cherish and value it, without ever straying from it.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:** The virtuous regard the Dao as their most precious treasure, not daring to defy it.\n\n**Master Cheng’s commentary:** Those who practice the Dao and are virtuous perceive true nature, and obtain the mystic pearl from the Crimson Stream. Thus they are able to cherish and value it.\n\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n**Imperial Commentary:** Refuge means entrusting. The unvirtuous, unable to cherish the supreme Dao, when confronted with calamity or urgency, resort to relying upon the Dao with their bodies to seek deliverance.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** Refuge means to guard and uphold. Common folk are immersed in material attachments, their dispositions shallow and competitive. How could they guard and uphold it?

      "translated_text": "**Imperial Annotation:**\nTo sweeten one’s speech so that it may be sold like merchandise, to elevate one’s conduct so that it may surpass others—this is to liken the Sage, who employs speech as sweet as lawful flavors and conduct as noble and pure, to transform the unvirtuous. Thus, like merchants selling their wares, they follow the good.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThis is an illustrative metaphor. It means that even the unvirtuous are within the scope of instruction. The Annotation says: *\"Sweetened speech can be sold like merchandise; noble conduct can surpass others.\"* This likens the Sage, who employs speech as sweet as lawful flavors and conduct as noble and pure, to transform the unvirtuous—just as merchants sell their goods, and people follow the good in turn. Hence the following passage.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"Sweet speech can be sold like merchandise.\"* Sweet speech alone can be sold in the marketplace. Truly, in market transactions, once the exchange is complete, there is no further harmony or goodness. Those who speak sweetly seek to obtain quickly, and those who sell seek to dispose of their goods quickly. *\"Noble conduct can surpass others.\"* *Surpass* here means to distinguish oneself. If one has noble conduct, it can set them apart from ordinary people, but this is still insufficient to uphold the Dao.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThose who embody the Dao forget about words; sincere words are not sweetened. Elaborate arguments that conceal falsehoods cannot truly grasp the real. Empty speech that loses substance—how could it be worthy of the Dao? Flowery words deceive the masses, adorn falsehood as truth, and idle theories confuse people, turning evil into good. Such speech may only be useful in the marketplace—how could it establish virtue and embrace the Dao?\n\nThose who attain the supreme Dao forget distinctions between self and others; those who awaken to nature merge into harmonious unity. How could one exalt oneself while belittling others, claim oneself while rejecting others, or place oneself above all things?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe unvirtuous have shallow hearts and actions, often speaking flatteringly and adorning their words with empty rhetoric, just like merchants in the marketplace vying for profit. Yet they cannot practice gentle humility, prioritize others, or humble themselves—only to then exalt their own conduct and domineer over others. Such are the unvirtuous; how distant they are from the Dao!\n\n**Secondly, it clarifies that the wise do not abandon the foolish, extending boundless compassion.**\n\nThough people may be unvirtuous, how could they be abandoned?\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nEven the unvirtuous are within the scope of transformation—how could they be cast aside?\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nIt says that though people’s speech and conduct may be unvirtuous, how could they be abandoned? One must guide them with the good Dao, hoping they will reform through transformation. It is not permissible to abandon them without instruction, hence the saying: *\"How could they be abandoned?\"*\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nThough people may be unvirtuous, they must be transformed through the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue and transformation were pure.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nThe Sage’s teachings are established to enlighten the ignorant. The wondrous Dao is vast and far-reaching, yet it is also perfected for those not yet awakened. It seeks to make both the virtuous and unvirtuous good, and both the knowing and ignorant wise. The Sage constantly rescues people—how could there be any abandonment?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*Deliberately*—why? The Sage’s enlightenment is profound and universal. Even if beings are unvirtuous, how could there be a heart of abandonment? It reveals boundless compassion, covering and aiding all without exception.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Ministers are appointed.\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nTo instruct the unvirtuous.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThe Three Ministers refer to the Grand Teacher, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian. The Son of Heaven governs without action, while the Three Ministers discuss the Dao, all serving as models to establish teachings and transform the unvirtuous. As the *Book of Documents* says: *\"Heaven’s work is continued by humanity\"*—this is what is meant.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nTo transform the unvirtuous through instruction.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nIn the most ancient times, the wise and foolish were equal, their bodies not straying from the Dao, their actions in harmony with nature—all treasured the Dao. But from the Three Dynasties onward, things grew corrupt. Without a ruler to guide people, and with a sovereign to transform them, the upper echelons established the *Wenhui* (literally, \"cultural harmony\") system, while below, officials were appointed to discuss the Dao. They demonstrated good and evil, admonished with rites and laws, transforming the unvirtuous and cultivating pure customs.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nSince the Sage’s enlightenment covers all without exception, it is fitting to establish methods to aid the world. Thus, the Son of Heaven is established to govern all affairs, and the Three Ministers are appointed to discuss the Dao. They regulate yin and yang, refine governance, and intend to guide all beings, protecting them from harm.\n\nSince the opening of creation, true sovereigns have appeared in the world—all embodying the Dao’s adaptive responses as emperors and kings, thus symbolizing the Three Pure Ones and establishing their officials.\n\n**Thirdly, it weighs benefits and harms to clarify victory and defeat.**\n\nEven with a *hongbi* (a large jade tablet) presented ahead of four horses, it is not as good as submitting to this Dao while seated.\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nThough the Three Ministers assist with offerings—even a *hongbi* jade tablet and four fine horses presented first—it is still not as precious as submitting to this Dao of *wuwei* to the sovereign for transforming people.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nA *hongbi* is a large jade tablet; four horses are the finest steeds. It says that though the Three Ministers, as ministers, present such treasures to the sovereign, they are still not as valuable as submitting the Dao of *wuwei* to transform evil into good.\n\nThe *hongbi* precedes the four horses because, in ancient tribute missions, one would first present the four horses, with the jade tablet as a guide—hence *\"preceding.\"* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *\"Driving a chariot with leather fittings and twelve oxen to reward the army\"*—this is the same.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong says:**\nEven if one arrives with a *hongbi* and four horses, it is still not as good as submitting to this Dao.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nIn ancient times, reclusive scholars would first present a jade tablet, then a horse—hence *\"preceding the four horses.\"* Those who invert right and wrong must be exposed with their deceits; those who cling to folly must be illuminated by wisdom’s torch.\n\nTo serve as the sovereign’s inner counsel and the ruler’s pillars of support—this is to rectify their evil and aid in propagating teachings.",

      "translated_text": "「Yet those who value fame are not content with their station, recklessly aspiring to honors beyond their merit. Those who crave favor do not follow the Dao but only seek lofty titles. By indulging in arrogance and extravagance, they invite misfortune upon themselves, ultimately facing ruin—far worse than cultivating the supreme Dao, where neither favor nor disgrace can perturb.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThe *hongbi* (拱璧) is the *hongbi* (拱把) jade tablet—when presenting a whole, round tablet, one must first fast and bow in reverence. Only then does one send the four horses. Though one may attain wealth and honor through a grandly adorned jade tablet, it is still inferior to the effortless practice of *zuowang* (坐忘), refining oneself in this Dao. Why so? For cultivating the Dao brings eternal life, while wealth and honor are but fleeting breaths. Hence, **Master Guangchengzi** (广成子) says:\n*\"Life in the world is like a cloud soaring in the sky—\nits form dissolves in an instant.\nTo measure it thus, nothing surpasses distance.\"*\n\n○ **Fourth Hypothesis and Admiration of Dao’s Power:**\nWhy was the Dao held in such esteem in antiquity?\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"Why\"* (何) here is a question word.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nTo cite ancient examples and prove their relevance today, inspiring trust in all things.\nThe ancients were the same as those who cherished the Dao and practiced virtue.\nWhy did they hold the Dao in such high regard?\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\nIn antiquity, the Dao was prized because one need not travel far to seek it—it is found within oneself.\n\n○ **Master Rong says:**\nFrom ancient times to the present, what does it mean to hold the Dao in such high regard?\nOne does not seek it for a single day and yet obtains it,\npracticing it to avoid calamities for a hundred years,\nensuring blessings and longevity while severing ties with danger and ruin.\nThus, the ancients and the present alike revered it,\nand all under Heaven and the gods cherish it universally.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nIt speaks of why the sages of old treasured the Dao so deeply.\nIt is because one does not need to spend a day seeking it before attaining it—\nthis refers to those who awaken and perceive the Dao immediately,\nwhile the deluded may wander countless kalpas without comprehension.\nEven if since beginningless time,\none has been bound by the cycles of birth and death,\nand by sin and suffering—\nshould one attain it, one may instantly return to the source,\nfreeing oneself from all burdens.\nSuch divine power is beyond imagination,\nhence the Dao is revered by all under Heaven.\n\nIs it not because one does not need to seek it daily before attaining it?\nAnd because one’s sins are pardoned?\nThus, the Dao is held in highest esteem.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nThe Dao lies in awakening, not in seeking.\nUnlike wealth and goods, which can be sought daily and obtained,\nthe Dao is not attained through daily effort.\nAwakening means no sins accumulate—\nthis is why it is held in highest esteem.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\nThis explains why the Dao is cherished.\n*\"One does not need to seek it daily before attaining it\"*—\nthe Dao lies in awakening,\nand awakening is the clarity of the mind,\nnot like the active methods of the world,\nwhich require years of accumulation and striving to achieve.\nBut if one clears the heart and extinguishes desire,\npurity arises naturally.\nThus, *\"one does not need to seek it daily before attaining it.\"*\n\n*\"And because one’s sins are pardoned?\"*—\nWhen the mind is lost in delusion and defilement,\nthe burden of karma arises.\nBut if one awakens to the Dao and embraces emptiness,\nthe causes of sin perish on their own.\nHow can this compare to those who cling to rigid attachments,\nwhose every action spawns regret and remorse,\nwho are ensnared by guilt and punishment yet still seek release?\nFor this reason alone,\nthe Dao is treasured by all virtuous men.\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"And because one’s sins are pardoned\"*—\nthose who commit sin are those who face turbulent times and tyrannical rulers,\nwho rashly impose punishments.\nYet cultivating the Dao can dissolve death itself,\nfreeing one from all suffering.\nThus, the Dao is held in highest esteem,\nfor its virtue and power permeate all things,\npreserving life and governing the realm with effortless harmony.\nHence, it is revered by all under Heaven.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Three: The Method of *Wuwei* (無為)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one,\nfor the earlier chapter expounded the righteousness of urging all to return to the Dao,\nwhereby one’s sins are pardoned.\nThus, this chapter illustrates the method of returning to the Dao,\nand the means of absolving sin.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:\nThe first clarifies that action does not contradict stillness—\nthis is the method of returning to the Dao.\nThe second demonstrates how to subdue the initial deluded mind—\nthis is the safeguard against sin.\nThe third warns against trivializing the words of the sages,\nto aid those who seek cultivation.\n\n**First: Action Does Not Contradict Stillness—The Method of Returning to the Dao.**\nThe Dao’s nature is profound and subtle,\nits essence and principle both serene.\nThe true gate is hidden and deep,\nits traces elusive beyond sound and color.\nIn the boundless void of great confusion,\none may doubt and follow external influences,\nyet such deeds shock the world and cannot endure.\nHow much better to act without acting,\nto strike thunderous drums yet leave no sound,\nto move beyond all measure!\n\nLight promises and few trustworthy words,\nexcessive speech and inevitable exhaustion—\nthe sage faces no difficulty,\nfor in a single breath, all is achieved.\nThe *He Shangzi* ascended into the void,\nrising a hundred zhang without fear.\nEmperor Wen of Han awoke early,\nhis frugal halls and curtains brought prosperity to the state.\nEmperor Qin of Qin fell into delusion,\nhis extravagant Alang Palace led to the nation’s destruction.\nThese words are heard in the ears—\nshould they not be heeded?\n\n**Master Laozi** (老君) despises this superficial flurry,\nurging gradual refinement instead.\nThus, one knows to respond to grievances with virtue,\nfor the most saintly sages discern the weight of great and small.\nThis is no idle talk.\n\nTo act without acting,\nto do without doing,\nto savor without savoring—\ngreat or small, much or little,\none pardons grievances with virtue,\ntranscending the distinctions of acting or not acting,\nof doing or not doing,\nof savoring or not savoring.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"To act without acting\"* (為無為),\n*\"to do without doing\"* (事無事),\nand *\"to savor without savoring\"* (味無味)—\nwhether great or small, much or little,\none does not exceed one’s portion,\nnor does one harbor resentment.\nIf one follows the senses and generates the mind,\ntransgressing boundaries and harming one’s nature,\nthen neither great nor small remains—\nall become objects of grievance.\nNow, having guarded one’s portion,\none preserves harmony through virtue.\n\n○ **Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"To act\"* (為) means to create and shape.\nThose who cultivate the Dao practice *zuowang* (坐忘) and abandon desire,\ntheir minds free from contrivance.\nWhatever they set in motion,\ntheir deeds and transformations are effortless—\nthus, *\"without acting\"* (無為).\nThis clarifies the mind.\n\nThey are not hindered by affairs,\nso *\"without doing\"* (無事) in matters—\nthis clarifies the body.\n\nThey do not linger in tastes,\nso *\"without savoring\"* (無味) in flavors—\nthis clarifies the tongue.\n\nWhen the three actions are still,\nthe six senses naturally cease.\nThus, *\"without acting\"* (無為),\n*\"without doing\"* (無事),\nand *\"without savoring\"* (無味).\n\n○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**\n*\"To act without acting\"*—\none refines cultivation, hence creates nothing.\n*\"To do without doing\"*—\none prepares in advance,\nremoving distractions and simplifying affairs.",
      "overlap_context": "h a *hongbi* and four horses, it is still not as good as submitting to this Dao.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nIn ancient times, reclusive scholars would first present a jade tablet, then a horse—hence *\"preceding the four horses.\"* Those who invert right and wrong must be exposed with their deceits; those who cling to folly must be illuminated by wisdom’s torch.\n\nTo serve as the sovereign’s inner counsel and the ruler’s pillars of support—this is to rectify their evil and aid in propagating teachings.",

cultivate the Dao and practice goodness,\ncutting off calamities before they arise.\n\n○ **Master Rong says:**\nResentment arises,\nsometimes great, sometimes small.\nHatred springs forth,\nnow few, now many.\nWhen one enters realms of affairs,\none is ensnared by burdens,\nand resentment begets resentment,\nendless in its cycle.\nIf one returns to the great Dao of *without acting*,\npreserving

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 64: *Its Ease in Holding Firm***\n\nThis chapter follows the previous one because, though the earlier passage clearly warns against the perils of sin, its guidance on practice remains incomplete. Thus, this chapter reiterates its meaning in four distinct ways: first, by teaching a method to subdue the initial mind; second, by offering an analogy to show how sin arises from subtle beginnings; third, by revealing how sentient beings, lost in delusion, stray from truth and lose their essence; and fourth, by citing the Sage’s example to demonstrate the path of learning.\n\n**First Method: Subduing the Initial Mind**\n\nThe earth remains unmoving—its *virtue* of *Kun* brings enduring stillness,\nMountains and peaks stand firm—deep roots anchor them forever.\n\nThose lost in the fourfold delusion’s realm,\nAbout to wander the fivefold turbid crossroads—\nNone can match the ease of holding firm what is already settled,\nFor what is subtle may yet be scattered.\n\nJust as a tree of ten *chi* grows from a hair’s tip,\nAnd a nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth,\nA thousand-*li* journey begins beneath the first step—\nWhat is small must grow great.\nThus, the roots of sin deepen gradually,\nAnd evil becomes transgression.\nLike layered towers expanding ever wider,\nOne must clear away the darkness of ignorance\nBefore venturing into the Dao’s profound realm.\nDo not be like Emperor Wu of Han, whose schemes failed,\nNor like one whose flesh is plentiful but marrow scarce,\nFailing to uphold Laozi’s precepts.\nA hollow belly and empty heart—\nEven wild grass proves too much to tame,\nLet alone the scattered currents of emotion and desire.\nOne must uproot them early,\nLest they spread unchecked,\nAnd thus align with the natural order of all things,\nIn harmony with the Dao of eternal life.\n\n**Its Ease in Holding Firm**\n*Imperial Commentary*: \"Its ease in holding firm\" means \"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen.\" When a person’s true nature is serene and still, and one seeks to grasp and hold it—before desire even stirs, before its signs appear—one can plan to cut it off, ensuring it never arises. This is what is meant by \"ease.\"\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *An* (安) means *stillness*; *chi* (持) means *to grasp*. When a person’s innate nature is pure and untouched by external influences, yet stirred by sensory objects into boundless craving, now we clarify that in the moment before desire arises—when the mind is still and unscattered—it is easy to grasp and hold. Hence, *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n*River-Upper Master (严君平)*: Governing the body and the state—what is serene is easy to uphold.\n\n*Li Rong* (李荣): *\"Its ease in holding firm\"* and *\"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen\"*—*an* (安) means *stillness*; *wei zhao* (未兆) means *the stirrings have not yet formed*. It is difficult to stop calamity and evil once they manifest, but if one seeks to remove evil, one must act before it stirs. If one seeks to prevent disaster, one must hold firm in stillness. When evil’s signs have not yet appeared, there is no need to plot—disaster will not arise naturally. This is what is called the conduct of the superior sage in preventing calamity.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *An* (安) means *stillness*. For those cultivating the Dao, when the mind is tranquil and no thoughts have yet arisen, this is the most opportune time for cultivation and guard.\n\n**Its Ease in Preventing What Has Not Yet Arisen**\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *Zhao* (兆) means *sprouting, emerging*; *mou* (谋) means *to plan*. When desire is about to arise but has not yet taken form, planning to cut it off is also very easy. Hence, *\"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen.\"*\n\n*River-Upper Master*: When the signs of desire and calamity have not yet appeared, it is easy to plan their cessation.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *Zhao* (兆) means *form, manifestation*; *mou* (谋) means *to devise*. Even if the mind has stirred but not yet grasped the object, and no form has yet appeared in the senses, one must immediately withdraw the mind to stillness. Since the deed has not yet been completed, it is easy to plan and consider.\n\n**Its Fragility, Easy to Shatter**\n*Imperial Commentary*: *\"Its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse\"*—when desire first takes root, it is still weak and fragile. Those who can sever it find it easy to break, for when calamity first stirs, its signs are still faint. If one seeks to prevent it, its subtlety makes it easy to disperse.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: When desire has already stirred but is still soft and not yet hardened, to remove it is easy to dissolve and break.\n\n*River-Upper Master*: When calamity has not yet sprouted and desire has not yet taken form, it is like something fragile and easy to remove.\n\n*Li Rong*: *\"Its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse\"*—when sin is minor, it is easy to extinguish; when evil grows, it is hard to remove. If one cannot prevent it before it stirs, one must restrain it in its fragility and subtlety. This is the conduct of the middle sage in eliminating and dispersing evil.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *\"Its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse\"*—*cui* (脆) means *hollow, like a gourd’s unripe fruit, soft and easy to break*. When the initial mind first stirs, it is just so: the karmic seeds are still shallow, hence easy to disperse.\n\n**Its Subtlety, Easy to Disperse**\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *Wei* (微) means *subtle*. When calamity first stirs faintly, before it grows great, preventing it at its origin makes it easy to disperse.\n\n*River-Upper Master*: When the matter has not yet become apparent, what is subtle is easy to disperse.\n\n**Act Before It Exists**\n*Imperial Commentary*: The reason holding firm and preventing what has not yet arisen is easy is that one must cultivate and remove it *before* it takes form.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: *Wei* (为) means *to cultivate and remove*. This sentence explains the two preceding ones—*\"its ease in holding firm\"* and *\"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen.\"* The meaning is: when desire has not yet arisen, one must cultivate and cut it off, ensuring evil does not take root. Hence, *\"act before it exists.\"*\n\n*River-Upper Master*: If one seeks to act, one must block its sprouting at the very beginning.\n\n*Li Rong*: This is what is meant by *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *Wei* (为) means *to cultivate and practice*. For those on the path, cultivation and guard must begin *before* defilement arises. This explains *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n**Prevent Before It Becomes Chaos**\n*Imperial Commentary*: This follows *\"its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse.\"* The reason it is easy is that one must remove it *before* it becomes calamity and chaos.\n\n*Imperial Exegesis*: This sentence explains the two preceding ones—*\"its fragility, easy to shatter\"* and *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse.\"* The reason it is easy is that even if desire has arisen, it is still fragile and subtle, not yet having become calamity and chaos, hence easy to rectify.",

      "translated_text": "「**River Master Cheng** said: In governing oneself and governing the realm, when chaos has not yet arisen, one must *preemptively close its gate*.\n\n**Li Rong** said: This is what is meant by *\"its fragility, easy to shatter.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *Chaos* refers to the entanglement of afflictions—when one is already ensnared by karmic bonds, the mind becomes obscured and disordered. Now, though the mind may arise and be defiled by external objects, it has not yet reached the point where it must be addressed, making it easy to govern. This explains *\"its subtlety, easy to disperse.\"*\n\n**Prevent Before It Becomes Chaos**\n**The Way of Rectification Begins in the Unmanifest**\n**River Master Cheng** said: A tree thick enough to encircle with one’s arms begins as a tiny sprout; a nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth; a journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step. This is what is meant by *\"its ease in holding firm.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The tree that grows to be encircled by arms originates from a single hair’s width of a sprout—this illustrates how the three paths of defilement arise from a single thought. The reason a tree is used as an analogy is that, from small to great, it can eventually block the sunlight, just as the defilement of the mind, from subtle to deep-rooted, can obscure one’s true nature. If one considers this tree as arising from emptiness—speaking of emptiness, the tree itself is not inherently existent—it is because the four dusts of sense perception do not solidify into form.\n\nAfflictions, too, arise from emptiness—speaking of emptiness, they are not inherently existent. The nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth—just as a tower of nine levels begins with a single basket of soil, so the calamity of the nine nights of suffering originates from a single defiled thought. This admonishes all learners to guard against negligence with utmost caution.\n\nA peak a hundred *ren* high begins with a single step—since seven *chi* make one *ren*, a mountain peak a hundred *ren* tall starts from the first step. The suffering of the eightfold path arises from the defilement of the mind. The analogy of the nine-tiered tower illustrates that afflictions have already taken root, while the hundred *ren* peak further warns that even greater calamity awaits if the defilement continues unchecked.\n\n**The Third Analogy Clarifies the Delusion of Sentient Beings**\n**Those Who Act Are Doomed to Fail; Those Who Cling Are Doomed to Lose**\n**River Master Cheng** said: Those who act are doomed to fail—if one acts upon external matters, one abandons natural spontaneity; if one acts upon moral principles, one abandons virtue; if one acts upon sensory pleasures, one abandons clarity of mind.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The supreme Dao is void and profound, requiring neither action nor attachment. Yet ordinary minds are inverted, clinging to action and attachment, which bring peril and ruin. Hence, it is said that *\"those who act are doomed to fail\"*—because attachment goes against reality, it is said that *\"those who cling are doomed to lose.\"*\n\n**The Fourth Section Cites the Sage to Validate the Teaching**\nThus, the Sage acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no failure; the Sage does not cling, hence there is no loss.\n\n**The Sage’s Natural Way**\n**River Master Cheng** said: The Sage acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no failure. The Sage does not adorn with empty rhetoric, hence there is no failure. The Sage does not indulge in sensory pleasures, hence there is no depletion. The Sage does not cling, hence there is no loss. The Sage possesses virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor, yet retains nothing for oneself, hence there is nothing lost to others.\n\n**Li Rong** said: Ordinary people are blind to immediate matters, hence they incur failures and losses. The Sage, however, perceives the unseen before its manifestation and thus avoids the perils of action.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The Sage embodies the Dao and acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no obstruction or failure. The Sage does not cling to illusions, hence does not lose their true nature. Ordinary people, when engaging in good deeds, often falter when success is near—greedy for status, fond of reputation, indulgent in luxury, and complacent in abundance—thus bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: *From* (从) means *to act* (为). When ordinary people pursue affairs, they often nearly achieve their moral merits but then, through greed for position and love of fame, through extravagance and arrogance, through indulgence and fullness, bring ruin upon themselves.",

      "translated_text": "「**Master Róng** said: *几* (near) means *near completion*. Ordinary people, when doing evil, cannot remove it early; when evil deeds are nearly complete, they naturally self-destruct. If one could align with the Sage, abandoning danger and seeking safety, they would never commit wrongdoing, nor incur blame, and thus would neither gain nor lose—what ruin or success could there be?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *几* (near) means *near completion*. Ordinary people cling to affairs of action (*youwei*), their minds restless and competitive, clinging to distinctions and grasping at gains—utterly lacking foresight. They always wish for near completion, yet have beginnings without endings, hence their frequent failures. The *Book of Songs* says: *\"None lack a beginning, few attain to the end.\"* To be cautious at the end as at the start ensures no ruinous affairs.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: To be cautious at the end as at the start, maintaining unwavering constancy, then there will be no failed undertakings.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis**: This is the Elder Master’s reiteration of his admonition. If a person can be cautious at the end as at the beginning, steadfast from start to finish, then there will be no failed undertakings.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: The end should be like the beginning; one must not slacken.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: This admonishes studious people to fortify their resolve, maintaining steadfastness from start to finish—how could there be failure? Among the Six Perfections (*liùdù*), this is the fourth: *renunciation* (*zìxìng*). Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, and does not value difficult-to-obtain wealth.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: Difficult-to-obtain wealth refers to what lies beyond one’s natural inclinations. Now, the Sage, in not desiring to desire, does not pursue what is beyond their nature, always preserving their spontaneity—this is not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: This illustrates the Sage’s conduct to repudiate the common. Difficult-to-obtain wealth—internally refers to what is beyond one’s natural inclinations, externally refers to pearls, rhinoceros horns, and treasures. The Sage, in not desiring to desire, neither internally pursues what is beyond their nature nor externally seeks wealth that burdens their virtue.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire: the Sage desires what others do not desire—others seek fame and display, the Sage desires obscurity; others desire ornamentation, the Sage desires simplicity; others value outward appearance, the Sage values inner virtue. The Sage does not covet difficult-to-obtain wealth, hence does not dazzle with gaudy attire nor demean stone while venerating jade.\n\n**Master Róng** said: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth; they study without studying, anticipating the faults of others. Ordinary emotions follow desires, demeaning the Dao while valuing wealth. The Sage is not greedy, cherishing truth while lightly esteeming treasures. If one cultivates not for self but for others, studies not for personal gain but for the benefit of others, then avarice brings misfortune, and striving for fame invites censure. The Sage, without desire, abandons worldly gain; ceasing study, they forget fame. They do not flaunt their own abilities but guard against the faults of others.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth; they study without studying, correcting the faults of others. The Sage’s illumination comes from the heavens, differing from common wisdom; they perceive all phenomena as empty and illusory, seeing no objects worth praising. Thus, within desire, they do not perceive desire’s form—since they do not desire to desire, why would they value jade and silk?\n\nAgain, they grasp the truth of reality without distinction, hence they forget study. To study is not to study; not to study is to study. Studying differs from not studying; not studying differs from studying. Hence the *Sūtra of the Western Ascension* (*Xīshēng Jīng*) says: *\"My learning has no learning; only then can I illuminate nature.\"*\n\nTo anticipate, means to prevent. Ordinary people cling rigidly to affairs of action, unable to forget study, hence the Sage speaks of \"studying without studying\" to prevent the faults of all beings.\n\n**Imperial Commentary**: \"Studying without studying\" corrects the faults of others, aiding the spontaneous nature of all things without daring to act. The Sage does not seek excessive learning, hence in \"studying without studying,\" they aim to return others’ excessive learning to its roots, aiding nature’s inherent essence, thus not daring to indulge in worldly desires or common studies.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The common folk value difficult-to-obtain wealth, hence they feign cleverness and flaunt their attainments, studying what lies beyond their natural inclinations. The Sage does not seek excessive learning, always preserving nature’s inherent essence—this is \"studying without studying,\" returning others’ excessive learning to its roots.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: \"Studying without studying\"—the Sage studies what others cannot study. Others study deceit and cunning; the Sage studies nature. Others study governance of the world; the Sage studies self-cultivation, guarding the true Dao.\n\nTo correct the faults of others—ordinary people study what is superficial, taking the end as the beginning. The superficial is indeed the ornament. To correct means to return to the root.\n\nTo aid the spontaneous nature of all things without daring to act—\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: To aid means to assist and guide. Nature is the inherent essence of things. All beings, deluded and misguided, lose their original essence. The Sage, with compassionate persuasion, encourages study without action, intending to assist and guide the true nature of things. Thus, they do not dare to act in worldly studies or excessive desires.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: To aid the spontaneous nature of all things, teaching people to return to reality—this is to assist the inherent essence of all things. Yet they do not dare to act. The Sage’s movements follow naturally, never daring to contrive, lest they stray from the root.\n\n**Master Róng** said: The nature of things is rooted in spontaneity. Desires corrupt with attachment, burdening truth; study obstructs with distinctions, hindering the Dao. Thus, the source of unity is obscured, and the true nature of the Way becomes difficult to discern. Without entering *wuwei*, one only returns to ruin. The Sage follows nature’s inherent essence, aids all things to preserve truth, never daring to act in contrived affairs, guiding them to return to emptiness and stillness.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: To aid means to assist and guide. All beings inherently possess nature’s upright essence, yet they are deluded and misguided, losing the Dao and abandoning truth. Now, the Sage seeks to uphold the method of \"studying without studying,\" guiding them to return to their roots. Though the Sage exhausts principles and fathoms nature, they also act without contrivance and without failing to act.»",
      "overlap_context": ". Ordinary people, when engaging in good deeds, often falter when success is near—greedy for status, fond of reputation, indulgent in luxury, and complacent in abundance—thus bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\n**River Master Cheng** said: *From* (从) means *to act* (为). When ordinary people pursue affairs, they often nearly achieve their moral merits but then, through greed for position and love of fame, through extravagance and arrogance, through indulgence and fullness, bring ruin upon themselves.",

      "translated_text": "「Now, when it is said that the Sage does not act, it is because they also wish to assist and guide the multitude, restoring them to nature’s inherent essence. Hence, they say, *\"do not dare to act.\"*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Sage’s Skill in the Dao**\nThe reason for this chapter’s sequence after the previous is that the prior chapter spoke of the Sage abandoning study yet still able to assist and guide all beings. Therefore, this chapter follows to reveal those who practice study and engage in beneficent deeds—within this chapter, its meaning unfolds in three distinctions:\n1) To cite antiquity and validate the present, employing eloquent discourse to clarify;\n2) To discern excellence and mediocrity, setting forth models for emulation;\n3) To invert convention and align with truth, demonstrating its profound allure.\n\n1) **Citing Antiquity and Validating the Present, Employing Eloquent Discourse to Clarify**\nThe Dao’s profound origin is subtle, its mysteries reaching the utmost purity. It eludes the ears and eyes, rendering perception and hearing as ineffectual as those of a fool. Confucius uncovered it yet remained unaware, Yan Hui conversed with it yet failed to grasp. Thus, governing with wisdom is like the harm of thieves and bandits; cultivating the Dao with *wuwei* allows each to attain their own fulfillment. Is not this the standard form?\n\nThen one understands that the true source of emptiness and purity, its principles penetrating beyond tranquil oblivion, the profound mystery of the *Chongxuan* (重玄), transcends the causes of mere non-existence. It is not something that can be imparted through mere exposition, nor is it within the grasp of those lost in error. The affairs of human conduct are indeed perilous, hence it is said:\n*\"When the ditch of Cao Gou was dug, the people were enslaved;\nWhen Qin’s wealth was prized, its lineage fell into ruin.\nSoaring before gathering, the phoenix calls from the high ridges;\nRushing yet not flying, the magpie withdraws to distant paths.\nActing against the natural order leads to loss,\nDeparting from the Dao leads to destruction.\nIf one can reverse their conduct with things,\nThen they grasp the principle of great harmony.\"*\n\n**The Sage’s Skill in the Dao Lies Not in Enlightening the People, But in Making Them Seem Foolish**\n**Master He’s Commentary**: The ancient Sage-rulers, skilled in the Dao, valued *wuwei* and tranquil simplicity—not flaunting their methods to enlighten the people, but guiding them toward purity, closing off their cleverness to restore them to their original simplicity, making them appear as foolish as they truly were.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: The ancient Sage-rulers, who excelled in using the Dao for transformation, prized *wuwei* and tranquil simplicity. They did not display their methods to enlighten the people, lest cleverness and deceit flourish, but instead led them to purity and simplicity, making them appear as though they were foolish.\n\n**Master He Shangong said**: The ancient Sage-rulers, skilled in the Dao, spoke of those who used the Dao to cultivate their own bodies and govern their states. They did not enlighten the people with the Dao, nor did they teach them with cleverness, lest they become deceptive and cunning. Instead, they sought to make the people appear simple and unassuming, free from deceit and artifice.\n\n**Master Yan said**: The ancient Sage-rulers, guarding their own simplicity, made their subjects return to natural purity. Without resorting to coercive laws or punishments, the people naturally conformed to transformation. If they did not practice the Dao of emptiness and stillness, but instead relied solely on cunning and cleverness, the more intelligence there was, the greater the chaos. Hence, they were difficult to govern.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *治* (govern) is the same as *理* (transform). *智* (wisdom) refers to distinctions and discernments. The reason all beings are difficult to transform is that their minds are too occupied with distinctions, unable to embrace emptiness and stillness. Hence, they are hard to guide.\n\n2) **Discerning Excellence and Mediocrity, Setting Forth Models for Emulation**\nThus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state.\n**Master He’s Commentary**: *以* (to use) means to employ. When a ruler appoints clever and wise ministers to govern the state, their cleverness will inevitably lead to the creation of laws, and laws will breed deceit. Hence, it is said that wisdom is the thief of the state.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: *以* (to use) means to employ. *贼* (thief) refers to harm. When a ruler employs ministers who are cunning and deceitful to govern the state, their cleverness will give rise to schemes and stratagems. Once these schemes are put into use, falsehood and artifice will flourish, and the Dao will be abandoned, causing harm to the state. Hence, it is said that wisdom is the thief of the state.\n\n**Master He Shangong said**: If clever and wise individuals are entrusted with governing the state, they will inevitably stray from the Dao, arbitrarily imposing rewards and punishments, becoming the thieves of the state.\n\n**Master Yan said**: Thus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state. Not governing with wisdom is the virtue of the state. Cleverness and cunning deeply harm the people, making wisdom the thief of the state. Pure simplicity without cleverness, letting things transform naturally, each attending to their own affairs, the people finding joy in their lives and families secure, harming neither others nor themselves, ruler and subjects both at ease—this is the virtue of the state.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: Thus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state; not governing with wisdom is the virtue of the state. If one uses penetrating insight to govern with cleverness, they deviate from natural harmony and align with harm like a thief. The former is reversed, the latter is harmonious—how can such discourse be considered similar?\n\n**Response**:\nThe earlier statement of \"reversed\" means that it is not reversed but instead is truly reversed. The later statement of \"harmonious\" also means it is not harmonious but truly harmonious. If it is truly harmonious, it does not deviate from the reversed; if it is truly reversed, it does not deviate from the harmonious. What then is there to object to?»",

      "translated_text": "「The Sage asks: The Classic speaks of *Great Harmony*—does harmony also have degrees of greatness and smallness?\n\nThe Master responds: When harmony is opposed to defiance, it may be small. But now, neither defying nor harmonizing, yet it is called *not* harmonious—harmony does not differ from defiance, nor does defiance oppose harmony. Thus, the Classic speaks in silence, following only the Dao, blending with the light and merging with the dust, ever abiding in harmony with principle. Whether harmony or non-harmony, non-harmony or harmony, all are simultaneously harmonious. Hence, there is neither harmony nor non-harmony, nor is there a lack of harmony while still being able to lack non-harmony, nor even a negation of non-harmony—this is why it is called *Great Harmony*.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six of the *King of the Hundred Valleys***—\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which elucidates the *Mysterious Virtue* of the Sage, reversing the profane and aligning with the Dao. Thus, this chapter further expounds the practice of harmonizing with the Dao.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:\n1. **The Parable**—to demonstrate *emptiness and forgetfulness*,\n2. **The Doctrine**—to illuminate *humility and retreat*,\n3. **The Conclusion**—to praise the power of *softness and weakness*.\n\n**1. The Parable—Demonstrating Emptiness and Forgetfulness**\nThe eastward-flowing rivers all converge and pay homage to the great sea. Spring gives rise to all things, each shaping itself naturally. Why, then, does the sea possess emptiness, and the rivers descend? The sea, though not empty, is the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it abides in the low places.\n\nThe Sage uses this as an analogy: casting aside fame and desires, utterly forgetting right and wrong, embracing the multitude with boundless ease, illuminating the minute dust within the mind’s breadth—all actions are humble, all positions are yielding. Thus, the people and the heavens rejoice in their adoration, who could dare to contend?\n\nA lingering presence in the rear is not a boast of prowess; a snake’s foot, when added, spoils the whole. Yet if one were to snatch the wine first, they would know the *Mysterious Extremes* operate in secrecy. The Sage’s enduring stillness and retreat bring constant ease, while *firm and white* arguments are but empty noise—those who are blind to the end shall never comprehend.\n\n**Shared Work**—what strength did he possess? He shattered the Heavenly Pillar and brought calamity upon himself. **The Qin Emperor**—what folly did he commit? He pierced the earth for markets and invited disaster. Unable to embrace softness and enlighten the distant, they grew rigid and harsh—how could they know that their realm would crumble, their kin perish, their lives extinguished, and the world delivered into the hands of common men? Such is their dire fate.\n\nAs **Yang Xiong** said: This is because they did not practice emptiness.\n\nThe sea is able to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it excels in descending. Hence, the sea abides in low places, and all rivers pay homage to it, just as people flock to their king.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary**: The sea is able to command the rivers to converge and pay homage because it excels in dwelling in the lowest places, governing the currents.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: The sea, by dwelling in the lowest places, becomes the *King of the Hundred Valleys* to which all rivers pay homage. Thus, the *I Ching* says: *\"The Earthly Dao transforms fullness into flowing humility.\"* This is the parable given.\n\nThe Earthly Dao, through humility, receives the rivers’ tribute. The Sage, through humility, draws the people’s devotion—none weary of approaching.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says: The sea is able to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it excels in descending. Thus, the sea, through its lowliness, becomes the gathering place of all rivers. Just as people flock to their king, so the rivers pay homage to the sea. The sea’s ability to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* is due to its lowliness.\n\n**Master Rong** says: This parable shows that the sea, by dwelling in low places, becomes the *King of the Hundred Valleys*, illustrating that the Sage’s humility makes them the sovereign of all under Heaven.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *King* means *direction*. The *Hundred Valleys* are like the *Hundred Rivers*. The sea is called the *King of the Hundred Rivers* because it dwells in the low, sunken places. If a person retreats in body and humbles in speech, empties themselves and yields to all, they too shall be the refuge of the common folk—thus they become the *King of the Hundred Valleys*.\n\nThis concludes the parable’s meaning, hence the Classic says: *\"The sea is the King of the Hundred Rivers.\"*\n\n**2. The Doctrine—Illuminating Humility and Retreat**\nThus, the Sage desires to be above others by first humbling their speech.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary**: The Sage, desiring to be above others, humbles their speech. Desiring to precede others, they retreat their own body. Hence, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, others do not suffer harm. Humility is the handle of virtue—when one uses it, its brilliance only grows. By humbling their speech, the people joyfully submit; by retreating their body, the people willingly approach. Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, others do not suffer harm.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: This combines the parable. The Sage, desiring to be above others, humbles their speech. Does the Sage truly wish to dwell above others while humbling their speech? No—only the Sage knows that fullness invites loss, so they speak in humility and yield in name, descending below all things. Yet their vast virtue and grand achievements naturally elevate them above others.\n\n**Master He Shang Gong** says: The Sage, desiring to be above others, seeks to stand above the people. By humbling their speech, they follow the sea’s example, dwelling in humility.\n\n**Master Rong** says: The Sage, desiring to be above the people, humbles their speech. Desiring to precede the people, they retreat their body. Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, the people do not suffer harm. By dwelling humbly beneath all, their virtue draws them upward. By retreating to let others pass, their embrace of the Dao renders them without desire or action—utterly empty, utterly still, forgetting the heart and casting aside cleverness, corpse-like in silent mystery. Such is the governance of the world by the *Highest Virtue*.\n\nBy this standard, superiority and inferiority become evident. If governing the state is thus, then so too should one’s personal conduct be. Not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary**: If the ruler does not employ cunning ministers but instead seeks those of pure virtue, allowing them to rest in the Dao of non-action and practice the *Great Simplicity*, the natural harmony will flourish, and this is the state’s blessing.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis**: The ruler, not entrusting themselves to cunning ministers but seeking those of pure virtue, sits in the Dao of non-action and walks in the *Great Simplicity*, achieving harmony and ease—this is the state’s blessing.»",

      "translated_text": "**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**\nIf one does not allow the wise and clever to govern the state’s affairs, then the people will uphold uprightness, not indulging in deceit. The ruler and subjects will be close, and the sovereign and ministers will act in concert—this is the state’s blessing. Knowing these two principles is also the standard.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary:**\nTo employ cunning ministers brings harm to the people, while to entrust oneself to those of pure virtue brings blessing to the state. If the ruler knows these two principles and delegates to ministers of pure virtue, this becomes the standard and model.\n\n**Master He’s Exegesis:**\nThe two principles refer to using wisdom and not using wisdom. The standard is the model, the law is the method. The ruler knows that using wisdom is like a thief, while not using it brings blessing—thus one must remove the thief and take the blessing. Only then can they be the standard and model for governing the state.\n\n**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**\nThe two principles refer to wisdom and lack of wisdom. Those who habitually know wisdom as a thief and lack of wisdom as a blessing are the standard and model for both personal cultivation and governing the state.\n\n**Master Rong says:**\nKnowing these two principles is also the standard. Habitually knowing the standard is called *Highest Virtue*. *Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching, contrary to all things, and only then does one attain the *Great Order*.\n\nUsing wisdom or not using wisdom—these are the two. Using it brings harm; not using it brings no injury. If one knows that the people suffer no harm when not using wisdom, then one knows the standard and model for governing the state. Knowing the standard and model, one’s foundation is firm and the realm secure—this is the subtlety of virtue.\n\nThe subtlety of virtue is unfathomable and deepens daily; its pursuit is boundless and distant. All men use wisdom, yet this one alone uses simplicity, for he is contrary to all things.\n\nNot opposing the nature of things, but letting them unfold naturally—this is the *Great Order*.\n\nIt is also said that the Dao is originally empty and mysterious, while the worldly ways are coarse and defiled. To conform to the world and seek the Dao is to lose the true; to oppose the world and cultivate virtue is to enter the subtle. Entering the subtle, there is neither \"can\" nor \"cannot\"; returning to the true, there is neither \"blocked\" nor \"unblocked.\" Since its response is boundless and formless, it attains the *Great Order* and equality.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe two principles refer to the earlier discussion of wisdom and lack of wisdom. Those who use wisdom as a thief and lack of wisdom as virtue can serve as the standard for personal cultivation and the grand principles for governing the state. Habitually knowing the standard is called *Highest Virtue*.\n\n**Master He’s Commentary:**\n*Highest Virtue* is profound, subtle, and far-reaching. The ruler who habitually knows these two principles as the standard and model possesses the profound and mysterious subtlety of virtue.\n\n**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**\n*Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching. The person of *Highest Virtue* is profound beyond measure and distant beyond reach. Contrary to all things, the person of *Highest Virtue* opposes the world’s inclination to benefit oneself, instead desiring to aid others. Only then does one attain the *Great Order*, which aligns with the natural Way of Heaven.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching, contrary to the world—this is called *Highest Virtue*. To exhaust the source and reach the utmost is called profound and far-reaching. The profound and far-reaching wisdom is contrary to worldly ways, hence one is contrary to all things. Only then does one attain the *Great Order*, which has two forms: one, aligning with the natural principles; two, conforming to worldly affairs. The former harmonizes with the subtle source; the latter descends with the dust.\n\n**Question:** Earlier it says \"contrary to things,\" yet later it says \"aligning with worldly ways.\" If the text first says \"contrary\" and then \"aligning,\" how can they be consistent?\n\n**Answer:** The earlier \"contrary\" means contrary without being contrary; the later \"aligning\" means aligning without being aligning. Aligning without deviating from the contrary, and being contrary without breaking from alignment—what is there to object to?\n\n**Question:** The scripture speaks of *Great Order*—does \"order\" also have degrees of greatness and smallness?\n\n**Answer:** When \"order\" is contrasted with \"disorder,\" even if it is small, here it is neither aligning nor disordering, yet called \"not aligning.\" Aligning does not differ from disordering, nor does disordering conflict with aligning. Thus, in silent repose, one follows only the Dao, blending light with dust, and ever aligns with the natural principles. Whether called aligning or not aligning, not aligning or aligning, aligning or not aligning—all are aligning in their own time. Hence there is no aligning nor non-aligning, no non-aligning yet able to be non-aligning, nor is there a negation of non-aligning—this is why it is called *Great Order*.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (江海为百谷王)**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded the person of *Highest Virtue*, contrary to the world yet aligning with the Dao. Thus, this chapter further displays the practice of aligning with the Dao.\n\nWithin this chapter, three themes unfold: first, an analogy to illustrate *emptiness-forgetting*; second, a teaching to demonstrate *humility-retreat*; third, a concluding reflection on the power of gentleness.\n\n**First: An Analogy to Illustrate *Emptiness-forgetting***\nThe eastern rivers all flow toward the sea, converging in their reverence for the great waters. In spring, all things arise, each taking shape in the natural Way. Why is it that the natural Way can be empty, and the great sea can be humble, so that the rivers may become its king?\n\nThe sage uses this as a metaphor: great dismissal of sounds and colors, complete forgetting of right and wrong. Welcoming the multitude with boundless harmony, illuminating the fine dust within the heart—wherever one goes, one is humble; wherever one stands, one is gentle and lowly. Then Heaven and man gladly acclaim, and who can dispute it?",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the Gentle Sovereign’s Authority**\nBecause of his refusal to burden or harm, the world’s people willingly acclaim him as their sovereign without tiring.\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe Sage’s virtue is vast and boundless, nurturing all things like spring’s warmth, shining forth like the sun. Since he neither burdens nor harms, the people joyfully acclaim him without tiring.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nThe Sage’s kindness is profound and his love vast—he regards the people as his own children. Thus, the world willingly unites to honor him as sovereign, none wearying of him.\n\n**Master Rong’s Reflection:**\nTherefore, the world rejoices in acclaiming him without tiring, for he does not contend. Thus, none can contend with him. Those without virtue are universally despised, but those who embody the Way are all gladly honored. Practicing humility and yielding, he aligns with the transformations of all things—who would dare to contend with him?\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nTherefore, the world rejoices in acclaiming him without tiring, for he does not contend. Thus, none can contend with him. The reason the people gladly honor him as their sovereign without tiring is that he is ever modest and yielding, never contending with others. Having abandoned strife and embraced equality, all distinctions of right and wrong cease—who would dare to contend with one who does not contend? Thus, none can contend with him. Because he does not contend, none can contend with him.\n\n**Commentary on the Sage’s Humility:**\nThe Sage is modest and retiring, not contending with others, so the world unites to honor him—who would dare to contend?\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe world rejoices in honoring the Sage without tiring, for his words place others above him, and his actions place himself behind them. Since he does not vie for precedence, none can contend with the Sage’s refusal to compete.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nBecause he does not contend, the world never tires of the Sage’s rule. This is because the Sage does not vie with others for precedence. Thus, none can contend with him. It is said that all people contend for action, but none contend with one who does not act.\n\n---\n**Chapter 67: On the Magnitude of the Dao**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded upon the Sage’s ability to be humble yet elevated. Thus, this chapter further elucidates his virtues and fully presents the Three Treasures.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning unfolds in five layers:\n1. He does not boast, so he is vast and great.\n2. He fully presents the Three Treasures, drawing all things to rely upon them.\n3. He reiterates the Three Treasures, praising their efficacy.\n4. He describes those who abandon the Three Treasures, sinking into death and life’s cycles.\n5. He concludes with a grand eulogy to boundless compassion and unparalleled virtue.\n\n**First Layer: He Does Not Boast, So He Is Vast and Great**\nThe profound and mysterious Dao originated before the Five Agents, and the subtle True Principle permeates the essence of the Original Harmony. Its form is vast, its virtue profound—transcending the laws of sensory desire and severing the boundaries of mundane perception. The common folk see only what is near, yet he does not defy the depths of the mysterious. Thus, though called \"great,\" he seems unremarkable. How could they know that the Three Treasures dwell in stillness, the True Vehicle daring not to lead? He ever guards humility and frugality.\n\nEven the sage-king Wen of Zhou, though wise, initially failed to grasp the Way of mutual benefit, and Emperor Wen of Han, though brilliant, did not comprehend the parable of the stacked firewood. How much less can the ordinary and vulgar, the coarse and mundane, fathom the profundity of the Mysterious Dao or grasp the depths of its Original Source? If they do not scorn it, how could it be called the Great Way?\n\nThe world says my Dao is great, yet it seems unremarkable.\n**Commentary:** *Xiào* (似) means \"to resemble.\"\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe world deems my Dao vast and boundless, yet it seems to resemble nothing. Thus, the following passage responds to this.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nThe Old Master says the world considers my Dao great, yet I feign ignorance, appearing unremarkable.\n\n**Master Rong’s Reflection:**\nThe world calls me great yet unremarkable. Only because it is great does it seem unremarkable. If it had long resembled something, it would be small indeed. The Old Master’s Dao is exalted in virtue and noble in power—truly worthy of being called great. Yet, he conceals his traces among the common, his presence hidden and inscrutable. He does not resemble the wise, nor does he resemble the foolish. Thus, he is called unremarkable.\n\n*Not resembling* means lacking comparison. Only the greatest of sages has nothing to compare to. If form had fixed qualities, wisdom had constant measures, or the Dao had attainments, these would be the petty schemes of small-minded people—not the boundless communion of the great sage.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nThe Old Master’s essence is naturally vast, his fruits perfectly realized, so the common folk universally revere him as the Great Sage. Why is this? Only because in dealing with others, he is modest and yielding, never boasting or scoffing. Thus, it is so.\n\nOnly because it is great does it seem unremarkable. If it had long resembled something, it would be small indeed.\n**Commentary:** Only my Dao is supremely great, so it resembles nothing. If it were like the laws of past ages—having something to resemble—it would no longer be called great. It would have long been insignificant.\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThis explains why it seems unremarkable. Only because my Dao is vast and transcendent, beyond the grasp of ordinary perception, can it be called great. If it resembled anything—like the laws of past ages—it would lose its claim to greatness and become insignificant. These are petty, shallow teachings, no different from the common ways—how could they be called great?\n\n*Ah!* (也夫) is an exclamatory particle.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nOnly because it is great does it seem unremarkable. Only those whose virtue is truly great harm themselves by claiming distinction, so they feign folly, appearing unremarkable, making no distinctions, and not elevating themselves above others. If it had long resembled something—*xiào* (善), meaning \"excellence\"—if great scholars and wise ones, tall and self-exalted, practiced meticulous governance, such ways have long existed.",

      "translated_text": "「Its subtlety, *ah!* (夫), is that those who speak of *xiào* (善, excellence) are but like petty men, not the noble. Only the wise uphold it.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nOnly because the Sage’s virtue is lofty and great does he not boast before things. If he boasted, he would be like the multitude of small-minded ones.\n\nMaster He Shang’s original text used the character *xiào* (肖), \"not resembling\" being akin to \"not excellent\" (不善). It means that all beings, unable to follow the excellent Dao/Way, are thus deemed unworthy by my greatness. Only through arrogance and haughtiness does my greatness fail to be excellent. If one can practice the excellent Dao/Way, they should instead be humbled and modest.\n\n**The Third Section: Emphasizing the Three Treasures, urging all to take refuge therein.**\nI possess the Three Treasures, safeguarding and upholding them.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nThough my Dao is great, it resembles nothing and lacks form, yet it holds these Three Practices, which are most precious. If one can steadfastly preserve, rely upon, and uphold them, they may govern themselves and the realm.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis clarifies why it appears unremarkable: precisely because it possesses these Three Practices, differing from the common ways. Thus, Master Laozi says my Dao, though great, resembles nothing, yet these Three Treasures are most precious.\n\nTo you, my successor, you must preserve and uphold them, safeguarding them to cultivate virtue and govern the realm.\n\n○ **Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nMaster Laozi speaks of my Three Treasures—compassion, frugality, and not daring to lead the world first—embraced and upheld.\n\n○ **Rong’s Explanation:**\nI possess Three Treasures: first, compassion (慈); second, frugality (俭); third, not daring to lead the world first (不敢为天下先). The common world values profit, esteeming it with seven rarities. The Dao lies in truth, weighing it with the Three Treasures. The meaning of the Three Treasures is not something sought externally; if one can be benevolent and wise toward all things, cherishing life and abhorring slaughter, this is the meaning of compassion.\n\nTo reduce taxes and lighten burdens, to be cautious in self-conduct and moderate in expenditure, neither extravagant nor ostentatious—this is the meaning of frugality.\n\nTo forget oneself for the sake of others, to retreat and guide them, not daring to lead the world first—this is the meaning of humility. To uphold these practices and cultivate virtue, applying these three principles, brings peace to the realm and tranquility to the family. Such is the greatness of this treasure.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nThus, the Sage’s virtue is lofty and great, yet he does not boast before things, for it is by taking refuge in the Three Treasures—preserving and upholding them—that he attains this state. The Three Treasures are: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to lead the world first.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nCompassion leads to broad salvation; frugality ensures sufficiency. Not daring to lead the world first means he delights in advancing others without weariness.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis enumerates the Three Treasures. To embody benevolence and extend generosity, to love and nurture all beings—this is compassion. To moderate use and enrich others, not to deplete things—this is frugality. Not to initiate actions, but to harmonize without leading—this is not daring to lead the world first. The meaning of expansion and benefit is as follows in the text below.\n\n○ **Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**\nFirst, compassion—loving the people as if they were his own children. Second, frugality—levying taxes and burdens as though taking from himself. Third, not daring to lead the world first—practicing humility and retreat, not initiating discord.\n\n○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**\nFirst, compassion—pitying and caring for the common folk, sharing their sorrows and joys. This is the Dao’s treasure. Second, frugality—desiring little and knowing contentment, guarding one’s portion without pride. This is the scripture’s treasure. Third, not daring to lead the world first—humble, yielding, and gentle, placing others before oneself, retreating to guide others. This is the Teacher’s treasure.\n\n**The Third Section: Repeating the Three Treasures, praising their efficacy.**\nCompassion thus fosters courage,\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**\nCompassion and benevolence, pity and wisdom, mean virtue abounds, hence courage in salvation and aid.\n\n○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis reveals the Three Treasures’ power to dispel confusion. Ordinary men, when not compassionate, are courageous. In decisiveness, they reach exhaustion and constraint.\n\n**Translation of overlapping terms for consistency:**\n- *xiào* (善) = **excellence** (as in *xiào*道, the excellent Dao/Way)\n- *xiào* (肖) = **resembling** (as in *xiào*似, resembling)\n- *不肖* = **not resembling** (as in *不肖*, not resembling)\n- *三宝* = **Three Treasures** (as in Daoist practice, not Buddhist *triple gems*)\n- *保而持之* = **safeguarding and upholding them**\n- *修身理国* = **cultivate virtue and govern the realm** (consistent with previous translations)",

Yu’s Annotation:\nUsing compassion in both war and defense,\nNot only does it bring human accord,\nThe Heavenly Dao is most clear—\nIt also aids and shields them.\n\nVictory in battle is Heaven’s salvation,\nSteadfastness in defense is Heaven’s protection.\nAll this stems from compassion,\nThus it is said: *Heaven’s salvation and protection through compassion*.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\n*Salvation* means *assistance*,\n*Protection* means *safeguarding*.\nThe Heavenly Dao blesses the virtuous—\nThe virtuous thrive, encountering no adversity.\nThus those who wage war with compassion,\nHeaven will assist them.\nThose who defend with compassion,\nHeaven will safeguard them.\nVictory and steadfastness begin with the practice of compassion,\nAnd end in receiving the Heavenly Dao’s clear aid.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThe Heavenly Dao saves the virtuous,\nNaturally granting them compassion and benevolence,\nSo they may cultivate and assist themselves.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nThe Heavenly Sage reveres the Dao,\nSaving and guiding those who practice compassion,\nAnd in return, they share compassion and benevolence,\nThus Heaven descends to aid and protect them.\n\nHence, within the Three Treasures, compassion is paramount,\nAnd among the Four Virtues, compassion is foremost—\nThus it is known that compassion’s meaning is vast indeed!\n\n○ **The Sixty-Eighth Chapter on the Virtuous Warrior of Antiquity**\nThe reason this chapter follows the previous:\nThe prior chapter fully expounds the Three Treasures,\nPraising the great compassion,\nThus this chapter follows to show\nThose who uphold the Three Treasures\nAttuned to the ancient Dao’s ultimate perfection.\n\nThis single chapter unfolds three themes:\nFirst, it draws upon ancient truths to exhort practitioners,\nSecond, it briefly enumerates the Three Virtues, revealing their superior practice,\nThird, it concludes with the Dao’s ultimate perfection, extolling their efficacy and power.\n\n**First: Drawing upon ancient truths to exhort practitioners.**\nIn the age when the Fire Officer regulated time,\nAnd the era of pure Dao was held in reverence,\nHuman hearts were simple and unadorned,\nUnconcerned with ostentation.\nWarriors who cultivated the Dao defended themselves with tranquil ease,\nThose skilled in battle halted their weapons to achieve victory,\nTheir thoughts were like smoldering embers,\nTheir forms like withered wood.\nAmong beasts, they dwelled without alarm,\nWithin flocks of tame birds, they moved without disorder.\nThus, the Duke of Zou tended his calves,\nIgnoring the filial submission of Yao’s heir,\nAnd the Marquis of Cheng plowed his fields,\nRejecting the words of Yu’s challenge,\nTheir conduct stood tall as Mount Hua’s peaks,\nTheir demeanor humble as Mount Ni’s summit.\nThe Son of Heaven could not claim them as subjects,\nThe feudal lords could not count them as allies.\nConfronting the business of the Dragon,\nThey feared not,\nDwelling among wooden geese,\nThey had nothing to dread—\nThus the virtuous warriors of antiquity\nWere worthy to be paired with Heaven itself!\n\nThe virtuous warrior does not rely on force,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\n*Warrior* means *one who serves*.\n*Force* means *threatening might*.\nThe enlightened ruler governs with virtue,\nPractices compassion and frugality to subdue all things,\nDoes not employ force to dominate people,\nHolding compassion as their highest virtue—\nThus it is said: *they do not rely on force*.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\n*Warrior* means *one who serves*.\nThose who govern the state with virtue\nHold virtue as their highest value—\nThus it is said: *they do not rely on force*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThe noble is in virtue and Dao,\nNot in martial prowess.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nWith compassion to approach all things,\nWith virtue to subdue people,\nNo state relies on brute strength,\nNo warrior values mere courage—\nWithout action yet transforming,\nThis is *not relying on force*.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nThe virtuous warriors of antiquity\nCultivated the Dao in quietude and withdrawal,\nNever abandoning compassion for force and courage.\n\n**Second: Briefly enumerating the Three Virtues to reveal their superior practice.**\nThe skilled warrior does not rage,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\nIf war is unavoidable, one must confront the enemy,\nWith compassion, it is virtuous—\nNot relying on fury.\nIf one uses force to contend,\nIt is not virtuous victory,\nFor the soft can overcome the distant,\nThe near can overcome the strong.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\nWhen the army marches to confront the enemy,\nTheir purpose is rooted in compassion and pity.\nThey drive away the stinging insects,\nExpel the pests—\nThat is all.\nThus it is known that virtuous warfare lies in halting the enemy,\nNot in relying on fury—\nHence it is said: *the skilled warrior does not rage*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThose who wage war with the Dao\nRestrain evil in their hearts,\nCutting off calamity before it sprouts,\nNever harboring resentment or anger.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nTo still the bandits and quell chaos is virtuous warfare.\nCompassion saves all things—\nNo need for rage.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nSkilled in penetrating the illusory nature of the world,\nThey can subdue the enemy before its rise,\nMasterfully embodying the emptiness of both opposition and compliance,\nThus their hearts hold neither joy nor anger.\n\nThe one who truly triumphs over the enemy does not contend,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\nVictory lies in harmony,\nHarmony brings virtuous triumph—\nThe ultimate virtue of complete victory,\nThus they do not engage in contention.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\nVirtuous victory lies in compassion,\nNot contending stems from upholding virtue.\nIf one uses force to seek victory,\nIt is not virtuous triumph.\nNow, the soft overcomes the distant,\nThe near overcomes the strong,\nCompassion and harmony are fully expressed,\nThey do not contend with the enemy—\nThe enemy surrenders on its own,\nThus it is said: *the one who truly triumphs does not contend*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThose who wage war with the Dao to triumph over the enemy\nDraw the near with benevolence,\nAttract the distant with virtue,\nDo not engage the enemy in battle—\nYet the enemy submits itself.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nThe Dao brings aid to all under Heaven,\nThe Four Seas come to acknowledge their rule,\nVirtue soothes the inner realm,\nThe Five Weapons are not raised—\nThings are subdued without blades,\nThus it is said: *triumph over the enemy*.\nWithout intent yet naturally revered,\nThus it is said: *no contention*.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:\nUnsoiled by the dusts,\nThis is called *triumph over the enemy*—\nSince they hold neither joy nor anger,\nWhat need is there for contention?\n\nThe virtuous leader uses others by placing themselves below,\n○ Master Yu’s Annotation:\nTo employ others, they set themselves beneath,\nAll people exert their utmost strength—\nThis is the virtue of the bell and the clapper,\nThus it is said: *the virtuous leader uses others by placing themselves below*.\n\n○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:\nThe virtuous leader employs others through humility,\nThus people will exert their utmost strength,\nAnd success can be achieved.\nHence the *Book of Changes* says:\n*To place the noble below the humble,\nThe great gain the people’s trust*.\n\n○ Master He Shang Gong said:\nThe virtuous leader employs others through humble assistance,\nAlways acting as the helper of others’ humility.\n\n○ Master Rong said:\nTo use others without losing their natural talents,\nTo assign tasks according to their strengths in both culture and martial skill—\nThis is virtuous leadership.\nThe broad can encompass all,\nThe humble can avoid blame,\nThus it is said: *placing themselves below*.\n\n○ Master Cheng’s

The application of martial power in dealing with all things, demonstrating that all phenomena are illusory.**\nWhen the sage-king **Emperor Yao** ruled, he slew **Gonggong** yet lamented his wickedness; when **Great Yu** acted, he struck down **Fangfeng** yet displayed righteous resolve. **Tang** exiled **Jie** to **Wutiao**, and **Wu** slaughtered **Zhou** at **Muye**. The **Divine Lady** (Xuannü) blazed forth, and the **White Deceiver** (Bai Jian) stood tall—though they waged external war against evil men, they were ultimately inwardly shamed by the triumph of virtue.\n\nThe **Old Master** (Laojun) teaches caution: *\"Retreat one foot, and my advance will be halted; press forward one inch, and I will not dare.\"* He feared losing his treasured virtue, lamenting the fleeting, deluded life of mortals. How could they know that when the **high black crow** (gao wu) is exhausted, the **fine bow** (liang gong) is concealed; when enemy states are diminished, the **strategists** (mou chen) perish?\n\nBefore the **military wells** (junjing) were dug, the soldiers would not thirst; before the **camp rations** (junfan) were cooked, the generals would not speak of hunger. Though **Bai Qi** was put to death in the **Qin court** and **Han Xin** was executed in the **Han prison**, why not follow the **two sages’** (Er Hao) example—hanging up one’s official hat at the **eastern gate**, emulating the **Four Worthies’** (Sihao) virtues, and letting thirst be nourished in the **Southern Hills**?\n\nHonor the **Great Sage’s** (Dasheng) clear instruction on self-restraint: *\"As long as my body remains, what need have I for further gain?\"*\n\n### **On the Practice of Warfare:**\n**Imperial Commentary:** The Old Master deplored the age’s reckless slaughter in war, thus assuming antiquity to admonish it.\n\n*\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* refers to the following text.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** The Old Master lamented the times, where lightheartedness toward enemies brings calamity and delight in killing leads to ruin. Thus, he invoked ancient teachings to warn against such folly, and *\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* refers to the next sentence.\n\n**Master He** (Heshang Gong) says: *\"He expounds the Dao/Way of warfare. The Old Master deplored the age’s warfare, thus assuming his own words to set forth their meaning.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** (Master Rong) says: *\"He cites ancient military strategies.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* means **martial power and wisdom** (quan zhi), the means by which one transforms and governs all beings—it is also how cultivators apply the **Six Senses** (liujing) in navigating the **phenomenal world** (chenjing). *\"On the Practice of Warfare\"* refers to the following text.\n\n*\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender,\"*\n**Imperial Commentary:** *\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender\"* means not daring to press forward one inch while retreating one foot. When the aggressor moves, he creates conflict and covetousness; when the defender remains passive, he relies on compassion to protect himself. To guard well is to achieve total victory; to create conflict is to court defeat. Though advancing even slightly risks stirring trouble, retreating even greatly does not lose humility. Thus, one must not dare to press forward one inch while retreating one foot.*\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *\"I\"* refers to the practitioner of warfare. The aggressor is the first to act, the defender responds afterward. The aggressor’s advance stirs conflict and covetousness; the defender’s retreat relies on compassion to guard himself. This teaches that ancient warriors, when wielding martial power, must always restrain themselves with compassion and never act impulsively.\n\nThus it is said: *\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender.\"*\n\n**Master He** says: *\"I do not dare to act as the aggressor\"*—the aggressor is the first to raise arms. *\"But only as the defender\"*—the defender is one who yields without provocation, always following the **Heavenly Mandate** (tian) before acting.*\n\n**Master Rong** says: *\"To raise arms first within one’s own state is to act as the aggressor; to move first in battle is to act as the aggressor. First to raise arms or first to move invites arrogance and peril. Now, if I wish to preserve myself, I must not dare to act as the aggressor. To yield without provocation, to follow without leading, is to act as the defender.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"Aggressor\"* refers to **myself** (my body); *\"defender\"* refers to **the enemy** (the opposing forces). Since both **essence and matter** (genchen) are emptied and all phenomena are illusory, there is neither a self to be preserved nor an enemy to be assailed. Thus, there is no need to advance or retreat.\n\n*\"I do not dare to press forward one inch while retreating one foot.\"*\n**Imperial Exegesis:** To retreat and defend in accordance with the Dao/Way is to achieve victory; to advance and seize by force leads to ruin. Though advancing even slightly risks the sin of greed, retreating even greatly gains the virtue of humility. Now, since I despise their strife, I say *\"I do not dare to press forward one inch,\"* and since I uphold compassion, I say *\"I retreat one foot.\"*\n\n**Master He** says: *\"To invade another’s territory, to plunder their wealth and treasures, is to advance. To close the gates and defend the city is to retreat.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** says: *\"Not to use force to invade others, hence *\"I do not dare to press forward one inch.\"* To rely on accumulated virtue to defend internally, hence *\"I retreat one foot.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *\"Advance\"* means **to take**; *\"retreat\"* means **to release**. One inch signifies **nothingness**; one foot signifies **existence**. Since both **wisdom and the world** (jingjing) are transcended and all phenomena are illusory, one abides in the **middle** (zhongyi), detached from both **action and non-action** (liangpian). Thus, there is nothing to take, nor anything to release.\n\n### **2. Reiterating prior teachings to reveal true emptiness.**\nThis is called **\"action without action\"** (xing wu xing),\n\n**Imperial Commentary:** When one retreats as the defender and does not contend, though one may move to meet the enemy, it is the same as **\"action without action.\"**\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:** To march an army relies on halting the enemy; the key is not to contend. Now, as the defender retreating one foot, one achieves victory without contention. Though one moves to meet the enemy, it aligns with **\"action without action.\"**\n\n**Master He** says: *\"If the enemy does not cease, he becomes a robber of the world. Though one moves to punish him, one does not act with malice.\"*\n\n**Master Rong** says: *\"Warfare originates from the enemy; I truly do not act first. I respond to things but do not initiate action—this is **\"action without action.\"***\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** Having transcended the duality of existence and non-existence, and penetrating the **forgetfulness of all perceptions** (jingguan), one thus moves in **\"action without action.\"**\n\n*\"Though I have no arms to wield,\"*\n**Imperial Exegesis:** *\"To wield arms\"* signifies **anger**. Now, since one wages war without anger, it is as if there are no arms to wield. Hence it is said: *\"Though I have no arms to wield.\"*",

Now, when the enemy retreats a step, no arms are needed to repel them, hence it is said: 'as though there were no arms to wield.'\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"Having abandoned limbs and senses, there are no arms to wield.\"*\n\n**Still, there is no enemy,**\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Still\"* means \"to draw in.\" To draw in the enemy is to desire contention while not contending, hence it is as though there were no enemy to draw in.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Still\"* means \"to draw in.\" The one who draws in the enemy desires contention, but now non-contention is held as virtue—thus, there is no enemy to draw in, hence it is said: *\"Still, there is no enemy.\"*\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Even if there is a desire to draw in the enemy, it is as though there were no enemy to draw in.\"*\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"To draw in that enemy is to make them return to having no enemy.\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"All phenomena are empty illusions; there is no enemy to rely upon.\"*\n\n**To grasp without weapons.**\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"To grasp weapons\"* signifies killing. Now, since compassion is the principle, even if one grasps them, it is as though there were no weapons.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"To grasp\"* means \"to hold.\" Weapons are the five weapons—spears, halberds, and the like. He who holds weapons intends to kill the enemy, but since compassion is the principle, he restrains his weapons—thus, though weapons exist, there is no intent to kill, making it as though there were no weapons.\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Even if one desires to grasp and wield them, it is as though there were no weapons to hold or use.\"*\n\nWhy? Because harming their people invites retribution from Heaven, encountering an unrighteous ruler brings pity and sorrow.\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"To harm the unrighteous is to wield weapons to cease warfare. Punishments without cruelty do not lose compassion; those who yearn for the Dao return of their own accord—there are no weapons to wield.\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"Having abandoned form and wisdom, there are no weapons to use.\"*\n\n**Thirdly, it clarifies that those who abandon compassion are lighthearted, lose the Dao, and invite disaster.**\nDisaster is none greater than being lighthearted toward the enemy—being lighthearted toward the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"The greatest disaster is being lighthearted toward the enemy. Being lighthearted toward the enemy leads to peril, and one loses the treasure of compassion.\"*\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Nearly\"* means \"close to.\" *\"Loss\"* means \"to lose.\" *\"Treasure\"* refers to compassion. The greatest disaster is being lighthearted and contemptuous toward the enemy, indulging in conflict—thus, one is close to losing the treasure of compassion.\n\nMoreover, losing compassion means defeat and ruin in war, and dispersion in defense. Though the paths of disaster may vary, dispersion and ruin are the greatest calamities.\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Disaster is none greater than being lighthearted toward the enemy. The harm of chaos is none greater than deceiving and plundering a lighthearted enemy without cease—lighthearted warfare leads to defeat and ruin. Being lighthearted toward the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure—'nearly' means 'close to,' and 'treasure' means 'life.' Deceiving a lighthearted enemy nearly causes the loss of life.\"*\n\n○ Master Yan says: *\"Being lighthearted toward the enemy is self-indulgence. Though warfare may seem flawless, one must not lightly treat the enemy. Lightheartedness breeds deceit; when disaster strikes, one loses advantage. Fortune departs, calamity arrives—this is the loss of the natural treasure.\"*\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"Warfare is rooted in killing and should not be perpetually waged in times of conflict. The Dao values stillness and quietude; thus, one governs things through non-action. The priority is to settle the people without harm. If one abandons the Way of non-action and advances with restless warfare, being lighthearted toward the enemy, the state will collapse and the people perish—this is the greatest disaster. A prosperous state with abundant people, a sage ruler and virtuous ministers—this is called possessing treasure. When the people perish and grain is exhausted, ministers are humiliated and the ruler is in peril—this is the loss of treasure.\"*\n\n○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *\"Disaster is none greater than contempt for the enemy. 'Contempt' means to lightly trample; 'enemy' refers to the frontier realm. Lightly staining oneself with dust invites the retribution of the Three Realms, thus bringing great disaster. Contempt for the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure—'nearly' means 'completely,' and 'treasure' refers to the Three Treasures from the previous chapter. To contain compassion while being bold is to contempt the enemy, inviting great calamity, thus completely losing the Three Treasures.\"*\n\n**Fourthly, it clarifies that when engaging with circumstances and applying wisdom, nothing surpasses great compassion.**\nThus, when armies clash, the one who exhibits compassion first shall prevail.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Antagonize\"* means \"to raise.\" When two states raise their armies against each other, the one who is compassionate and pitiful toward others wins.\n\n○ Imperial Exegesis: *\"Antagonize\"* means \"to raise.\" When two states raise their armies against each other, it is because their rulers practice the Dao, their generals act with compassion, and they are merciful toward others—not seeking excessive slaughter—that they achieve victory.\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Thus, when armies clash—the two enemies engage in battle—compassion prevails. Compassion is mercy and benevolence; soldiers do not approach death.\"*\n\n○ Master Yan says: *\"The ruler is the heart and core of the state; the army is its formidable spirit. Concealed in the mysterious realm, it is only used when unavoidable. Thus, I instruct my generals to delight the soldiers, be compassionate toward people, and move with Heaven’s assistance.\"*\n\n○ Master Rong says: *\"When both sides raise their forces, it is called 'antagonizing armies.' Whether many or few, they are evenly matched. Being lighthearted toward the enemy, greedy for killing—this is inferior. Stillness must rely on the Dao; action must follow its laws. Never losing compassion, compassion can govern all—thus, the compassionate prevail. Internally, it clarifies that afflictions are manifold; without wisdom, they cannot be broken. To expound its method, it is said: 'Warfare has its principles.'*\n\n*The ruler must be strong and resolute; as a guest, one must be yielding and flexible. The traveler desires to cease movement and return to stillness, knowing to be strong as a ruler and yielding as a guest—hence it is said: 'I dare not be the ruler but must be the guest.'*\n\n*The Dao, though seemingly obscured, advances like retreat. Learning has nothing to learn; cultivation has nothing to cultivate—advancing not an inch yet retreating a foot. Recognizing that all conditions are contingent and teachings are all empty, one moves in 'action without action.'\"*",

      "translated_text": "The myriad realms are void and tranquil, yet one’s own body is also empty and pure—*repelling without arms*. Internally, wisdom is lost; *holding without weapons*. Externally, emotions and desires are severed, yet still there is no enemy.\n\nIf one abandons emotions and indulges in extreme desires, straying from the Dao and forfeiting one’s life, they lose their precious treasure.\n\nWisdom and afflictions—these two kinds always follow one in turn. *Resisting is like yielding*; if skillful means are applied to wisdom, subtle compassion is never lost. When defilements are exhausted, even the mind relaxes; solemn and unburdened, the compassionate prevail.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: If, then. Compassion, mercy. Resisting, lifting. The roots of sense and dust press upon one; lifting the eyes, the forms and colors correspond.\n\nIf one still employs the great mercy of the heart to survey the coming realm, then subject and object are both emptied, and self and other are pure. Hence, all dharmas become realms of supreme victory.\n\n---\n\nThe Way of my words is most easy to know—*Chapter Seventy*.\n\nThe Way of my words follows the previous chapter, for the previous chapter expounds the proper method of dealing with people and wielding power, demonstrating the true emptiness of the Dao. Thus, this chapter follows, clarifying the teachings of the spoken word and lamenting that people cannot know them.\n\nIn this chapter, the text opens with two distinctions: first, lamenting that the profound teaching is easy to know yet common folk cannot grasp it; second, illustrating the sage’s subtle understanding, hence *outerly veiled, inwardly revealed*.\n\nFirst, lamenting that the profound teaching is easy to know yet common folk cannot grasp it.\n\n*The Book of Yu* says: The heart of the Dao is subtle, subtle then easy to perceive; the heart of people is dark, dark then difficult to see. They follow the crowd and drift with conventions, chasing fame and gain. Blessings are light as feathers, yet they do not know to bear them upon themselves; calamities are heavy as mountains, yet they do not know to avoid them from themselves.\n\nThe common folk are indeed deluded in their measure; truly, this saying holds. The Way beneath heaven is easy to practice, yet none surpass the upright. Uninvolved, unconcerned, with no attachments nor demands.\n\nWhere is the resting place of the mind? Roaming the wilds of Dongting, boundless in all directions—no hindrance. In the silent night or the celestial halls, all paths are the same, utterly pure. Shutting the eyes, one arrives at the *Pure Land of Jade*; forgetting the mind, one sits in the *Empty Palace of Jade*. Still and unobstructed by dust, what need is there for the wise to change? Yet they stubbornly persist, indulging in luxury at dawn’s table; staining themselves with sounds and colors in their attachments. Slothful and fixed in evil deeds, they sink into the *difficult-to-abandon* realm, unaware of the easy-to-practice teaching. The sage in rags is indeed worthy of pity.\n\nMy words are most easy to know, most easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: The Old Master says: My spoken words accord with principle, hence easy to know; they are simple in practice, hence easy to act.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: The Old Master says: My words are such that they clarify principle. When principle is clarified, words are forgotten—hence easy to know. My affairs are such that they involve no affairs; simplicity in affairs means no action—hence easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: The Old Master’s words are concise and easy to know, brief and easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Yan* says: The sage’s words are the unsaid words; their deeds are the *doing of the undone*. They sever the Way of words, abandon the mind and discard intentions. Their actions are the manifestation of naturalness. All beings fulfill their desires and attain eternal life. Words are easy to know; affairs are easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Rong* says: The sage’s teachings are concise in words yet rich in principle, clearly revealing their meaning—hence easy to know. Holding to the One, they sever the myriad delusions; embracing non-action, they cut free from burdens—hence easy to practice.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: My words are the same as the previous chapter. What is stained is not truly stained—this is easy to know. To practice without the form of practice is most easy to practice. None beneath heaven can know, none can practice.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: The people of the world are entangled in words and do not awaken; they are burdened by affairs and do not simplify—hence none can know, none can practice.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: This laments that the multitude cannot comprehend the *wordless word*, clinging to words and stagnating in teaching. They are bewildered by the words of instruction, hence none can know. Unable to perceive the *affairless affair*, burdened by affairs and lost in dusty matters—hence none can practice.\n\n○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: They love the weak and soft, yet crave the strong and rigid.\n\n○ *Master Rong* says: The common folk do not adhere to the mysterious teachings; they cling to ignorance and have not yet opened to wisdom. They do not recognize this Way—hence none can know. They are lost in desires and do not habituate in non-action; they abandon the true and follow the false—hence none can practice.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: None, that is, without. The Old Master’s words are easy to know and practice, yet the people of the world are dull and obtuse. None can know the profound and empty words; none can follow the teaching and practice.\n\nWords have a *root*; affairs have a *master*.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: Words reside in principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten—hence the root of words is in the wordless. Affairs reside in accomplishment; when success is achieved, one does not cling to them—hence the master of affairs is in the affairless.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: This reverses the explanation of easy-to-know and easy-to-practice. Root, origin. Master, lord. Words exist to clarify principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten—hence the root of words is in the unsaid. Affairs exist to achieve success; when success is attained, one abandons affairs—hence the master of affairs is in the affairless. Is this not easy to know and practice?\n\n○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: My words have a root and origin; affairs have lords and subjects. The world’s people, if they do not know them, are not without virtue—it is they who oppose me.\n\n○ *Master Rong* says: Root, origin. Master, lord. Taking virtue and the Dao as the origin, this is truly easy to know. Taking non-action as the lord, this is truly easy to practice. Those who lose the origin and chase the end are many; those who do not embody the true root and abandon emotions to defy nature are numerous. How could they know that the lord and master are such that all follow and practice accordingly? Hence it is said: None beneath heaven can know or practice.\n\n○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Words, the scriptures and teachings. Master, the Son of Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "The teachings, though broad, find their essence in the *Zhongyuan* (Recondite Mystery). Worldly affairs, though manifold, are governed by the Lord and Master. Seizing this essential meaning reveals what is easy to know.\n\nIt is only because of their ignorance that they fail to know me.\n*御注*: It is only because the common people lack the awakened understanding that they do not know my teaching of non-speech and non-affairs.\n\n*御疏*: \"Do not know me\" means they do not know my teachings. It is only because the common people are bewildered and lack awakened understanding, bound by names and forms, unable to grasp the principles. In affairs, they cling to affairs; in speech, they are entangled in words—thus they fail to grasp my teaching of non-speech and non-affairs.\n\nAgain, it is explained: The Old Master said, \"Only what I know is what lies in non-knowing,\" yet the people of the world use knowing to seek knowing, hence they do not know me.\n\n*Master He Shang Gong* says: It is only because the world’s people are ignorant that my Dao and virtue remain obscure, unseen externally, reaching the utmost subtlety—thus they are without knowing.\n\n*Master Rong* says: All things are shrouded in delusion, lacking even a speck of discernment within, hence it is said they are without knowing. Lost in principle and straying from the Way, they lack the wisdom of ten thousand things externally, hence they do not know me.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: \"Do not know me\" is the same as \"do not know my teachings.\" Only those beings who are ignorant and dull-witted cannot comprehend my profound words. Those who know me are few, hence those who follow me are noble.\n\n*御注*: Those who truly understand my teaching of forgetting knowing are rare. The law of my speechless instruction is thus most noble.\n\n*御疏*: \"Few\" means \"rare.\" \"Law\" means \"principle.\" The Old Master said that those who understand my teaching of knowing while forgetting knowing are indeed few. If one follows and practices my words as law, then they may be held in honor.\n\n*Master He Shang Gong* says: \"Few\" means \"rare.\" Only those who attain the Dao can know me, hence they are noble.\n\n*Master Rong* says: The busy and petty value names, the petty-minded love profit. Few can embody the Dao, hence it is said those who know me are few. The weak and lost do not return; their return lies in the true path. Those who drift do not reflect; their reflection lies in the true source. The Dao is thus honored, and the law is thus noble.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Those who know me are few, for the common mind is shallow and many are deluded, few truly comprehending the sacred teachings. Those who follow me are noble—\"follow\" means \"law.\" Adhering to my scriptures and teachings, practicing them, and attaining the sacred fruit, this is why they are noble.\n\nNext, it is shown that the Sage’s wisdom is profound yet externally veiled, internally illuminated. Hence the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\n\n*御注*: Wearing coarse cloth means concealing the external. Harboring jade means illuminating the internal. Thus, those who know me are few.\n\n*御疏*: \"Coarse cloth\" refers to a rough garment, worn by the lowly. Wrapping oneself in coarse cloth conceals fine garments beneath. Jade is pure and lustrous, fitting to compare with the virtuous gentleman. This is said to reveal the Sage’s inner wisdom, outwardly appearing foolish, hence \"wearing coarse cloth,\" and inwardly possessing wisdom, hence \"harboring jade.\"\n\n*Master He Shang Gong* says: Wearing coarse cloth means being thin externally; harboring jade means being rich internally. It is to hide treasure and conceal virtue, not revealing it to others.\n\n*Master Yan* says: Wearing coarse cloth means being meager in body; harboring jade means being rich in spirit.\n\n*Master Rong* says: Conforming to the world and blending with dust, outwardly showing coarse garments—this is wearing coarse cloth. The Recondite Virtue is unstained, pure and luminous—this is harboring jade.\n\n*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Knowing the Sage’s words and following the Sage’s teachings, with understanding and practice complete, one thus becomes a Sage. Coarse cloth is the garment of rustics; jade is a precious treasure. Externally blending with the world, wearing coarse cloth; internally serene and empty, harboring jade. Harboring jade means outwardly dwelling in the mundane while always true; wearing coarse cloth means inwardly empty and focused while interacting with others.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\nThis chapter follows the previous one because the previous chapter illuminated the Sage’s knowing, hence externally veiled and internally illuminated. Thus, this chapter follows, showing that even though one may know, there are many who mistake knowing for non-knowing. This chapter’s meaning is divided into two parts: first, revealing the traces of the original traces, demonstrating responses adapting to circumstances; second, revealing the stillness within responses, manifesting the Sage’s heart unburdened.\n\n**First: Revealing the traces of the original traces, demonstrating responses adapting to circumstances.**\n\nTo shut the door and block the senses is the grand rule of the great Sage. To curb desires and be cautious of subtleties is the exemplary standard of the ancient worthies. Hence, the Duke of Zhou’s temple was restored with threefold silence from the golden mouth, and the Master’s courtyard saw twice-repeated words from the white jade tablet. Ji Bu was esteemed for a single promise, yet He Chen’s extravagance led to ruin at ten thousand coins. Austerity brings clarity and tranquility; extravagance invites reproach and calamity. Liu Kun, embodying the Dao, answered the Han Emperor with evident clarity. Yan Zi nearly attained it, dwelling in Confucius’ gate as if in ignorance. How could he compare with the clamorous thief Zhi, who died for gain at Dong Ling? The meticulous Jiang Chong perished in the Northern Prison from slander. Geng Chun was mocked in the marketplace and met with great disaster. Kong Guang did not betray the secret at Wen Shu, thus preserving his life.\n\nDoing leads to ruin. Recently, observing the drilling of Hun Dun, one fails to grasp its subtlety. Yet, if one heeds the admonition of the enemy’s mirror, a hundred hooks will lead to ruin, while nurturing a chicken fully ensures victory. The Sage’s illness—is it for the sake of common folk?\n\nKnowing the unknown...",

Accumulated, these become burdensome afflictions—great threats.

Yet they fail to rest quietly to nurture life, cultivate virtue to ward off death, wandering like lost travelers, clinging to foreign places as vast, while despising their homeland as narrow. This is to narrow one’s dwelling.\n\nProlonging evil harms conduct; indulging desire harms the body. To act thus is to court death, unable to endure long. To weary of life—this is what must be avoided.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Do not narrow your dwelling, do not weary of your life. *Yàn* (厌) means to abandon; *xiá* (狭) means inferior. *Jū* (居) means to dwell. Your life is the heart. It is said that those who cultivate the Dao must keep the heart unencumbered, not confining emotions to narrow or inferior states, abandoning the source of life. Why? Though the body is empty, it is the vessel for receiving the Dao. One must neither cling to it nor reject it. To cling brings attachment to action; to reject falls into the illusion of emptiness. Neither clinging nor rejecting, dwelling in the middle while forgetting the middle—this is the way of the True Scholar.\n\nDo not weary of your life.\n\n**Commentary (御注):** That which the body generates is the spirit. To not weary is to have few thoughts and desires, avoiding exhaustion.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** That which the body generates is the spirit. *Yàn* (厌) means to despise. The spirit is what gives life, hence it is called that which the body generates. The spirit thrives in emptiness and stillness; one must purify the heart and quiet the mind, and the spirit shall return. If one indulges desires, exhausting the spirit’s purity, or engages in frivolous schemes, then *jing* and *qi* shall scatter and dissipate. When they dissipate, death follows. Thus, it is admonished to not weary of the spirit, preserving the way of enduring life.\n\n**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** That which sustains life is the spirit, dwelling in emptiness, favoring stillness. If one overeats, neglects the Dao, and indulges in lust, filling the mind with perversity, this is to harm the root and weary the spirit.\n\nOnly those who do not weary shall not be wearyed.\n\n**Commentary (御注):** Only those who do not weary the spirit shall find the spirit does not weary of them in return.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** The *Dao* lends itself to those who honor it daily. The form is sustained by the spirit. If one loves the Dao and preserves the spirit, it is said, \"Only those who do not weary shall not be wearyed.\" Cleansing impurities and stilling thoughts, being singular and pure, the spirit does not weary of the person—hence, \"it is so.\"\n\n**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** Only those who do not weary the spirit—cleansing the heart of filth, serene and desireless—shall find the spirit dwelling within them without weariness.\n\n**Master Rong’s Saying (荣曰):** Life arises from the Dao, form is completed by the spirit. If one loves the Dao and preserves the spirit, it is said, \"Only those who do not weary shall not be wearyed.\" Cleansing impurities and stilling thoughts, the mind becomes tranquil, the form pure. When the spirit attaches to the person and the Dao cherishes them, it is said, \"it is so.\"\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Only those who cultivate the realm of refinement—neither empty nor substantial—can truly cultivate it. Wisdom neither clings nor rejects; rejection aligns with wisdom, hence it is not wearying.\n\n---\n\n**Third: Illuminating the Sage’s Proof to Show Taking and Discarding**\n\nThus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,\n\n**Commentary (御注):** Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself, loves himself without arrogance. Knowing his own body, he wards off fearful matters. Loving his own body, he avoids the guilt of wearying the spirit. He does not reveal his abilities to invite misfortune, nor does he exalt himself to gather resentment. Abandon this revealing and exalting; embrace this knowing and loving.\n\n**Exegesis (御疏):** *Zì zhī* (自知) is self-reflection and introspection, preventing harm in its subtlety, ensuring no fearful matters arise. *Bù zì xiàn* (不自见) means not to flaunt one’s talents before others, lest one deviate from reason and invite misfortune.",

Thus, he abandons the latter to embrace the former. Ordinary emotions stray from the **Dao/Way**, and so they become **unaware** (無識). The Sage’s wisdom penetrates reason, so he knows himself and forgets the distinctions of self and others, obliterates sensory perceptions, and thus does not reveal himself. **Treasure the spirit and spare the qi**, firmly resolve to cultivate the **Dao/Way**, not lightly squandering this life, hence it is said: love himself without exalting himself, not holding cheap what is small nor despising what is low, acting to benefit others, and in his aspirations, harmonizing high and low. Thus, it is said: he does not exalt himself.\n\nThose who know and love themselves have awakened to reason; those who reveal and exalt themselves are lost in delusion. The Sage speaks of self-transformation to guide all things, making them aware of their proper return. He discards the delusion of revealing and exalting to take up self-knowing and self-loving, thereby preserving his true nature.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** His wisdom aligns with the **Dao/Way’s** realm, penetrating the true source of **dharma**.

Not exalt himself means not to seek high status or fame in the world.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Nurturing the true nature of his essence, he does not lightly indulge in sensual desires—this is loving himself.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 73: \"Courageous and Bold\"**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior passage reveals how sentient beings, lacking wisdom, fear neither the **Dharma-net** nor the **Three Paths of Retribution**, thus sinking into suffering. Hence, this chapter emphasizes how the courageous and resolute, through their deeds, return to the cycle of birth and death.\n\nWithin this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:\n1. The differing paths of the common and the Sage, with their contrasting benefits and harms;\n2. The natural consequences of virtue and licentiousness, arising from **Heavenly Principle** (*天理*);\n3. The conclusion that Heaven’s net is vast, yet retribution is without fail.\n\n**First, the differing paths of the common and the Sage, with their contrasting benefits and harms.**\n\nThe Sage’s heart, like Heaven’s application of the **Dao**, governs the realm with humility—when kings establish their states, modesty brings radiance, and gentleness yields authority. Yet boldness, when unchecked, invites calamity. Thus, the **Vermilion Emperor** flourished by yielding, while the **White Lord** perished by defiance. Boldness, when reckless, leads to slaughter—this truth is clear. Yet why do people not reflect upon it?\n\nWhen **Fenglong** raises his voice, he meets the **Summer Emperor** and must sing;\nWhen wild geese take flight, they align with the autumn mist and rise.\nEven mindless things respond to the seasons—how much more so should humans, bearing hearts, act without the **Dao** as their guide?\n\nHeaven’s net is unerring; the sun and moon maintain their constancy.\nEarth’s **Principle** is without bias—mountains and rivers stand firm, never crumbling into decay,\nNor do they erupt in chaos at the **Tail Interval** (*尾间*).\nWhen the **Way of Gentleness** is vast and **Virtue of Humility** is steadfast,\nResponding without speech, arriving without summons,\nEven Heaven’s net, though vast, will not fail to record accumulated **virtue and vice**.\n\n**Boldness leads to death; courage tempered by restraint leads to life.**\n**Róng’s Commentary:** *Dare* means decisive boldness—when a person acts with reckless resolve, abandoning humility and retreat, it brings ruin. Thus, it leads to death. But restraint preserves life.\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Courage* is vigor; *dare* is decisive action. Those of rigid strength, fearing nothing, lose humility and retreat, descending into reckless defiance—this is the path of self-destruction. Hence, *\"Boldness leads to death.\"* But when one acts with caution, restraining aggression and avoiding peril, this is the path of self-preservation. Hence, *\"Courage tempered by restraint leads to life.\"*\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Boldness leads to death—bold action invites self-ruin. Courage tempered by restraint leads to life—boldness without recklessness preserves one’s life.\n\n**Li Róng** said: Boldness is fearlessness; *dare* is resolute intent. To face blades before one, regarding death as life—that is the courage of the heroic. Yet lacking strategy, strength alone cannot prevail. If one pursues gain recklessly, disaster follows. Hence, it leads to death. But if one acts without contention, guided by **ren** and **virtue**, perhaps through **Dao** to transform others or through wisdom to subdue things—harming none, yet safeguarding oneself—this leads to life.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Courage* is swift action; *dare* is decisive resolve; *death* is annihilation; *life* is longevity. When the heart rushes forward with resolute intent, clinging to worldly affairs, it leads to annihilation. But if the heart remains serene and detached, avoiding attachment, then it attains longevity. Understanding these two paths reveals their differing benefits and harms.\n\n**Róng’s Commentary:** Knowing these two paths—whether beneficial or harmful—what does Heaven abhor? The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. *Or* means \"possessing.\" Those who know to refrain possess benefit; those who dare possess harm. One must therefore cultivate courage in restraint—this is the way of the truly bold. To act recklessly invites disaster, for this is what Heaven abhors. Who can fathom its intent?\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. When one knows that boldness leads to harm and restraint to benefit, one must cultivate courage in restraint. Though both share the name *courage*, their applications differ—hence, *\"or beneficial, or harmful.\"*\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Always knowing these two paths—*dare* and *not dare*—benefit is preserving life; harm is self-destruction.\n\n**Li Róng** said: This refers to death and life.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Or* means indeterminate. The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. When the heart advances without attachment, it attains longevity—thus, benefit. When the body acts greedily, it returns to annihilation—thus, harm.\n\n**Second, the consequences of virtue and licentiousness, arising from Heavenly Principle.**\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor, and who can know its intent?\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Who* means \"who.\" *Intent* means \"reason.\" Those who act boldly invite harm—this is what Heaven’s **Dao** abhors. Yet common folk cannot grasp its reasoning.\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: What Heaven abhors is reckless action. Who can know its intent and avoid transgression?\n\n**Li Róng** said: Heaven’s **Dao** cherishes life and abhors killing. Yet people often fail to seek benefit or avoid harm—this is ignorance of Heaven’s intent.\n\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** By nature, Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness. Examining retribution’s depths, none can fathom its sovereign. Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\n**Róng’s Commentary:** Even the Sage finds boldness perilous.\n\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** This example of the Sage admonishes the common. Though the Sage’s wisdom makes boldness difficult, fearing its harm, how much more so for the ordinary who would dare it?\n\n**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: The Sage’s virtue, even so, finds boldness arduous. How much more for those without the Sage’s virtue who would attempt it?\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs.",

It merely bestows blessings on the virtuous and retribution on the licentious, with omens of good and ill—thus it is said that virtue responds without speech. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not call, yet all things move in response to the seasons. ○\n**Róng** said: Retribution for crimes and blessings is as certain as an echo; thus it is said that virtue responds. ○\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** The response of blessings and retribution is like an echo—evil and virtue must answer without need of words.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not summon yet things come of their own accord. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** The coming of all things is by fate’s decree, yet Heaven does not summon them to obey itself. All things come naturally and follow Heaven’s way—like the yin embracing the yang, spring arises and summer flourishes, none summoned yet they come. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not call to all things; they bear yin and turn toward yang. ○\n**Róng** said: Spring blooms, winter fades; cold departs, heat arrives. Those who go are not sent away, those who come are not summoned by command. ○\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** Retribution for virtue and vice follows their deeds—no need for summoning, yet it must come.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven is tranquil yet ever well-planned. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** The note says Heaven’s **Dao** is profound and vast, silently vast, symbolically transforming—humans may take it as model, hence it is said to be well-planned. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: *Tán* means vast; though Heaven’s **Dao** is wide and boundless, it plans well for human affairs, rewarding virtue and punishing vice, each receiving their due. ○\n**Yán** said: Silent and boundless, nothing escapes its design. ○\n**Róng** said: The Great **Dao** is most level; thus it is said to be *tán* and *rán*. It weighs human gain and loss, with rewards and punishments without error; it discerns virtue and vice, with calamities and omens never failing—thus it is said to be well-planned. ○\n**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Cóng* means calculation. It speaks of the hidden principles of fate, needing no words to precisely measure deeds and misdeeds, without error.\n\n**Third Paragraph:** Heaven’s net is vast and wide, yet retribution never falters.\nHeaven’s net spreads far and wide, yet its rewards and punishments for virtue and vice are never lost, not even by a hair’s breadth. ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Huīhuī*, vast and wide. This passage elucidates the previous meaning of Heaven’s **Dao**. Though Heaven’s net is vast and wide, far-reaching and sparse, its rewards for virtue and punishments for vice never fail, not even by a hair’s breadth. ○\n**Héshàng Gōng** said: What Heaven’s net encompasses is vast and boundless; though sparse and distant, it oversees and judges human virtue and vice without error. ○\n**Róng** said: It spreads through the boundless void and weaves among manifest forms—both vast and wide, hence *huīhuī*. Crimes are public or private, yet Heaven’s mercy knows no scale; even the slightest offense is recorded, with no oversight in its sparse or dense tracking—thus it is said to never fail.\n\n**Chapter 74: People Do Not Fear Death**\n*Chapter on People Not Fearing Death*, thus following the previous. The prior chapter showed how creatures do not fear threats or punishments, yet must face Heaven’s net; hence this chapter follows, revealing that Heaven’s net has its unseen overseers.\n\nThis chapter unfolds four themes: First, that creatures are burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and do not fear punishment; Second, that crimes, once deep, will surely invite suffering retribution; Third, that these sufferings are meted out by unseen judges; Fourth, that those who presume to act as Heaven’s judges will instead incur its blame.\n\n**First Theme:** Creatures are burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and do not fear punishment.\nHeaven’s **Dao** upholds true names; punishment is natural. Why then do rulers threaten people with death? They wear jade pendants at their belts and display them in times of crisis, clutching golden scepters and wielding them at the court’s threshold. Yī and Lǚ serve as ministers, Píng Bó plots to overthrow. The dynasty’s fate is sealed—when the age of great peace arrives, the ruler’s singular merit alone will earn him the title of *yīràng* sovereign. Then he may drum his belly in the courtyard and strike the earth in the fields, unaware of Heaven’s power, how could he bear the king’s favor?\n\nIn May, he wears his winter coat, not envying the lightly clad guest; a foot of cloth is too short, yet he keeps only the upright man. Then he understands the hundred-year fate is all by Heaven’s decree.\n\nIn life, gold and jade mark his dwelling, yet he knows the fate of the withered ram; in death, his stone tablet bears gold inscriptions, and Guō Pú foretells it first. Thus the saying: *\"Death and life have fate; truly, it is so.\"*\n\nNow, if one falsely executes punishment to replace Heaven’s judgment, how could such logic be erased? How could the unseen judges agree? It is like a substitute craftsman measuring with a ruler—he will surely suffer injury to his hands.\n\nPeople are unaccustomed to fearing death—why then do rulers threaten them with it? ○\n**Róng’s Exegesis:** If one indulges desires freely, provoking death’s reach, and grows accustomed to it without fear, how could rulers further establish punishments to strike terror through killing?",

How much more for those without the Sage’s virtue who would attempt it?\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs.",

      "translated_text": "○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** It speaks of how people cannot uphold the **Dao/Way** of purity and tranquility, instead indulging their passions and provoking death’s grasp. This becomes ingrained habit, and they grow so accustomed that they no longer fear it. Thus, rulers should guide them through the **Dao/Way** of purity and tranquility, yet why do they enforce punishments and killings to instill fear of death?\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The people do not fear death because the governance of the state is harsh, leaving them barely able to survive. Those who govern themselves are harmed by their cravings, while greed for wealth destroys their lives—yet the people do not know to fear these things. Why then do rulers threaten them with death, instead of lightening their punishments and teaching them to abandon their desires? Why set punishments and threaten death?\n\n○ **Yán** said: Human nature, when content, finds peace; when discontented, it schemes wrongly. In destitution, one scorns death; in comfort, one cherishes life. If the people’s hearts are not satisfied and their lives are not preserved, then decrees will fail to move them. The beasts of the destitute do not shun rhinoceroses or tigers—such is their nature, and the logic of their plight.\n\n○ **Róng** said: In an age of **Dao/Way**, all beings cherish life, and the **Dao/Way** of non-action makes them spare death. If one cannot pacify them with supreme **virtue/power**, yet restrains them with harsh punishments, the people will barely survive, hence the saying: *\"People do not fear death.\"* The root of people not fearing death lies in cruel punishments; it is fitting to rely on pardon, using **virtue/power** to make them forget punishments. How could one still apply harsh laws to the people, desiring they fear death? This laments the failures of the times.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation (成疏):** This condemns the common delusion of passion, deeply entrenched and unrelenting. They pursue fleeting pleasures without regard for life and death, yet even with stern warnings and teachings, they remain without fear—thus the sigh of *\"Why?\"* is raised, profound and sorrowful.\n\nSecondly, it clarifies that deep crimes will surely invite suffering retribution. If the people were to constantly fear death, yet one were to act deceitfully, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? **Lord’s Annotation (御注):** If all were to follow the path of purity and restraint, daring not to wallow in passion or indulge desires, and constantly feared death, yet a single deceitful one acted strangely, even if I could seize and kill them, who would dare to do so?\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** This explains how rulers guide through non-action, and the people temper their desires, each preserving their own lives, and thus fearing death. Yet if one were to act deceitfully and wickedly, and I could seize and kill them, who would dare to do so? The reason they are not killed is that there exists the **Heavenly Net** (天网) that governs retribution—thus the following text states:\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: If the people were to constantly fear death, it would be because I had removed my own acts of cruelty and taught them to abandon greed. Yet if one were to act deceitfully, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? When **Dao/Way** is used to guide, but the people do not comply, instead acting craftily, they then fall under the **King’s Law** (王法) to be seized and killed. Who would dare to offend?\n\n**Lǎo Zǐ** lamented the times when kings do not first guide with **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, but instead enforce punishments.\n\n○ **Róng** said: The deceitful are those who disrupt the order with cunning. If the age’s ruler upholds the **Dao/Way**, all preserve their lives, and this is called fearing death. Yet those who act violently and disrupt the order grow ever more deceitful and strange in their crimes. Heaven does not endure evil, so they are seized and killed. Those who truly fear death and cultivate life—who would dare to commit wrongs?\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation (成疏):** The heart of greed generates ever more deceitful schemes, firmly rooted in perversion, until it becomes their norm. The unseen judges (冥司) capture and kill them, their retribution as sharp as the wind and as evident as the scriptures. If any have insight, who would dare to create sin?\n\nThirdly, it clarifies that this suffering retribution comes from the unseen judges (冥司). There are always those who govern punishment.\n\n**Lord’s Annotation (御注):** Such deceitful ones are not spared by the **Heavenly Net**—it is the unseen judges of Heaven who kill them. It states that wicked ones are killed by the unseen judges, and rulers, using their authority, seize and kill them conveniently—this is to act as substitutes for the unseen judges.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** *Suī* (司) means \"master\" or \"official.\" Heaven’s discernment is all-pervading, nothing escapes its gaze. Deceitful ones cannot escape their deaths, for it is Heaven’s unseen judges who kill them.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The unseen judges are Heaven, which stands high and surveys all below, overseeing human transgressions. The **Heavenly Net** is vast yet not flawed—this is its nature.\n\n○ **Yán** said: The unseen judges are the great ministers. The **Dao/Way** of the emperor and king is to act without action, delegating duties to those before, behind, left, and right. Those who create calamity die, those who usurp authority perish with their clans, and all officials attend to their duties—none of it concerns the sovereign.\n\n○ **Róng** said: *Suī* (司) means \"master.\" The principles of reward and punishment are constant, and the officials of life and death have their masters. One cannot act wickedly, and those who break the law must die—yet they seek to usurp the unseen judges’ role and kill at will.\n\nFourthly, it strengthens the argument that substituting for the unseen judges will instead bring one’s own blame. To act as a substitute for the unseen judges is to act as a substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠).\n\n**Lord’s Annotation (御注):** If rulers delight in seizing and killing themselves, they will not align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** It speaks of how wicked ones are killed by the unseen judges, and rulers, using their authority, seize and kill them conveniently—this is the unseen judges killing people, yet they do not align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, just as a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is supremely clear, and the unseen judges have their constants, just as spring brings birth and summer growth, autumn harvest and winter concealment, the stars and Big Dipper shift in their courses to govern the seasons.

      "translated_text": "○ **Yán** said: The one who substitutes for the unseen judges is the ruler. When officials lose their proper function, governance collapses. When the sovereign takes on self-renewal, skilled laborers fold their hands idle. When the ruler takes on killing, officials lose their proper roles.\n\n○ **Róng** said: To substitute for the unseen judges is to substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands. Though Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is distant, its mysterious discernment is profound and clear. Rewarding the virtuous and punishing the wicked is recorded in the unseen judges. Spring brings birth and summer growth, clearly manifest in the seen substitutes. If temporal governance cannot fulfill its role in accordance with Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and instead substitutes with human effort, it also strays from the **Dao/Way**.\n\nYet even so, most stubborn people are few in following transformation, and many deceitful flaws are difficult to prevent. Adjusting measures according to the times, establishing laws and ordinances, there are those in charge of punishment and officials in charge of killing. If they do not delegate to their proper authorities, and killing is not carried out by its proper officials, but those who usurp killing—it is like a clumsy man substituting for a skilled artisan, bound to bring injury to their hands. Though few may escape injury, those injured will be many.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** To substitute for the unseen judges is to substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands. All beings create karma and reap their due retribution. Punishments and suffering belong to the unseen judges. The unenlightened, acting from arrogance, presumptuously substitute for the unseen judges in executing punishments—how different is this from an ordinary, clumsy artisan substituting for a master carpenter in woodwork? A clumsy artisan, working beyond their capacity, not only fails in their task but also injures their hands. To forcibly substitute for the unseen judges is the same—it is not merely an abuse of duty but invites disaster. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands.\n\n**Lord’s Annotation:** A clumsy man substituting for woodwork—how could he avoid injuring the village [community]? He would also injure his own hands. When a ruler assumes the role of punishment, substituting for the unseen judges, how could he avoid harming the people while also losing Heaven’s harmony?\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork moves in accordance with the square and round. A clumsy man substituting for him must deviate from the plumb line and level. Could one’s heart not be harmed by the village [community] while injuring their hands? Heaven’s net does not fail, and divine principles are manifest. If a ruler assumes punishment, substituting for the unseen judges, how could he avoid harming the people while losing Heaven’s harmony? Why does he act with such disregard for death?\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: When a ruler enforces punishments, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork—then the square and round will not align, and he will harm himself. To substitute for Heaven in killing is to lose the proper order; if the proper order is lost, he will suffer the consequences.\n\n○ **Yán** said: When skilled laborers fold their hands idle, the great hall cannot be built. When a ruler monopolizes killing, the world loses its proper order. If the great hall cannot be built, there will be no shelter for descendants. If the world loses governance, the state cannot be secure. The chapter on people’s hunger follows the previous one, as the previous chapter clearly establishes that beings with deep karmic guilt must reap suffering. This chapter then explains why such suffering is incurred—due to attachment to worldly actions. Within this chapter, three themes unfold: first, explaining why beings lack virtue due to attachment to worldly affairs; second, why beings shorten their lives due to excessive focus on sustenance; third, demonstrating the beauty of forgetting life to guide learners.\n\n**First, explaining why beings lack virtue due to attachment to worldly affairs:**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** and virtue are forgotten when one indulges in worldly pursuits, and thus one attains the leisure of the fish in the lake. As for the benevolent influence of Emperor Wén and Emperor Xīn, the enlightened governance of King Chéng and King Kāng—these were indeed praised as the great blessings of the Zhou. Yet during the Han, when the state was governed by law, the *lǔ* arrows came from the east, and divine forces were invoked from the west. The four classes lived in peace, the people lived without strife, and tribute included eight layers of silk. The fields yielded double harvests of rice, gentle winds blew morning and evening, sweet dew fell in the courtyards. The crown prince’s virtue was abundant in the Green Palace, and ministers assisted in the **Dao/Way** at the Red Gate. Heaven was balanced, Earth was upright, lawsuits ceased, and punishments were clear. The people of Yáo’s time could be sealed in their homes, and those of Shùn’s era thrived in their courtyards. They enjoyed the joy of proper governance—how could there be taxes from hunger? They did not die lightly, and with the sage’s teaching of non-action, they found their own ease.\n\nThe people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason the people of the world suffer hunger and want is that their rulers consume too much in taxes.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** People are the foundation of the state. If governance is burdensome and taxes are heavy, the people will become impoverished, and the foundation will decay—decay leads to danger. Thus, the people’s insufficiency comes from the ruler consuming too much in taxes, causing their hunger and want.\n\n○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. The reason the people suffer hunger and cold is that their rulers consume too much in taxes, hence their hunger. Therefore, the people blame their rulers for greed, abandoning the **Dao/Way** and virtue, and thus they suffer hunger.\n\n○ **Róng** said: When the common people are hungry and the four classes are impoverished, it is not due to other causes—taxes are heavy and levies are excessive.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** It says the people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. Hunger refers to lacking inner virtue. \"Upper\" refers to the heart, which governs the five viscera and a hundred actions, hence called \"upper.\" Taxes mean accumulation, and \"food\" refers to tastes. It states that practitioners ruin their virtue by indulging in sensory pleasures. Hence, they suffer hunger—connecting with the previous meaning.\n\nThe difficulty in governing the people arises because their rulers engage in worldly affairs, hence the difficulty in governing them. **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason the people of the world are difficult to govern and transform is that their rulers engage in worldly affairs, making governance difficult and deceitful schemes prevalent.",

      "translated_text": "「○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The teeming masses rely on their ruler for governance, for governance is rooted in *wuwei* (無為). Thus, when I practice *wuwei*, the people naturally transform themselves.\n\nYet the reason people are difficult to govern today is that their rulers engage in worldly affairs. When rulers act, governance becomes burdensome and the people are disturbed; every action spawns great deceit, hence the difficulty in governing them.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:** The people are difficult to govern because their rulers engage in worldly affairs. The people cannot be governed because their rulers are consumed by desires and fond of worldly actions, hence the difficulty in governing them.\n\n○ **Yán (严) says:** Thus, the people emulate the ruler’s worldly affairs, and their deceitful inclinations make them difficult to govern.\n\n○ **Róng (荣) says:** Worldly actions disrupt the natural order, making governance difficult. When the ruler aligns with *wuwei* (無為), the people naturally transform.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** The people are difficult to govern because their ruler engages in worldly affairs, causing all actions to stray and multiply in chaotic ways. This is because the heart indulges in worldly pursuits—when the heart practices *wuwei*, all actions become easy to govern. Thus, one knows that all phenomena rest in the mind alone.\n\nHence, the difficulty in governing—this concludes the previous meaning.\n\n**Secondly, it illustrates why beings shorten their lifespan: excessive attachment to life.**\n\nThe people’s disregard for death stems from their relentless pursuit of life—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The people of the world lightly embrace death because they violate natural limits in their excessive pursuit of life, hence they meet their end.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason people lightly court death and lose their lives is that they violate natural limits, indulging in excessive nourishment and life-preservation. They disregard the law’s penalties, recklessly pursuing their desires—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life. The people lightly transgress against death because they cling to ways of sustaining life, greedily seeking profit to endanger themselves—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\n○ **Yán says:** It is because of their excessive pursuit of life that they lightly court death.\n\n○ **Róng says:** Those who cling to life suppress their true nature with false desires, while those who lightly embrace death are ensnared by deluded cravings, clinging to the transient body as if it were eternal. Hence, it speaks of the excessive pursuit of life. Excessive means accumulation, abundance—when affairs accumulate, the mind is disordered; when tastes multiply, vitality wanes. Unable to cherish life with caution, they squander themselves through indulgence and lightly court death.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive attachment to life. Practitioners who do not fulfill their natural lifespan and lightly court death are those who remain entangled in delusion, failing to awaken. They do not comprehend that all phenomena, including life, are illusory—life is but the absence of death. Yet they burden themselves with excessive demands on the six senses and overindulge in the four elements—hence, they lightly embrace death.\n\nThis concludes the previous meaning.\n\n**Thirdly, it demonstrates the beauty of forgetting life, urging scholars to reflect.**\n\nIndeed, those who do not excessively cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** When natural sustenance is sufficient, life is preserved. If one overnourishes beyond natural limits, life is lost. Thus, those who do not excessively cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\n\n○ **Lord’s Annotation:** Life has its bounds—contentment is enough, yet one must neither defy nor overreach them. If one pursues life beyond its proper measure, confusion follows. Thus, not clinging to life preserves it, while excessive pursuit destroys it. Hence, one knows that those who do not make life their concern are wiser than those who vainly prize it.\n\n○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says:** Only those who do not make life their primary concern—who remain untouched by rank and wealth, who do not covet profit or power—can be said to be wiser than those who prize life.\n\n○ **Yán says:** The natural Dao always opposes artificiality. The lifeless attain life, while the living cling to life and meet death. Those who pursue life for its gains are the origin of death; those who abandon life’s attachments are the beginning of true life. Not clinging to others’ concerns brings peace; not clinging to life brings longevity.\n\n○ **Róng says:** Heaven grants life as a finite reality, yet excessive nurturing beyond its measure harms it—this is failing to truly cherish life. Those who grasp the supreme Dao perceive the body as illusory, understanding that governance is lifeless. They do not cling to false forms, naturally releasing the burdens of attachment. They align with emptiness and coldness, harmonizing with virtue, sharing in the Dao’s root. Though they do not nourish life, life nourishes itself—this is truly cherishing life.\n\nWise (*xián*, 賢) means virtuous; prizing (*guì*, 貴) means valuing.\n\n○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** Wise (*xián*, 賢) means good. Those who attain profound insight do not extinguish sensory existence but instead practice *zuòwàng* (坐忘), realizing life’s formless nature. Hence, those who are repelled by vulgarity and disdain worldly pleasures—who alone do not make life their primary concern—are truly virtuous in safeguarding and valuing life.\n\n**Chapter on the Lifespan of Human Beings**\n\nThis chapter follows the previous because the prior illustrates how those who cling to life ultimately court death, while those who forget life achieve longevity. Thus, this chapter explains that gentle and weak beings naturally attain longevity, while the rigid and strong perish early. To distinguish excellence from mediocrity, this is why it follows.\n\nThis chapter’s meaning is divided into three parts: first, it presents two paired analogies to contrast life and death in the strong and weak; second, it unites the analogies to argue their superiority and inferiority; third, it uses the analogies and further elaboration to reinforce the meaning.\n\n**First, it presents two paired analogies to contrast life and death in the strong and weak.**\n\nThe *Nánchāng* (南昌) adjusts its course, bestowing life on the weak and frail. The *Běidì* (北帝) of *Āngdū* (酆都) holds the register of death, seizing the strong and mighty. The heavens favor the light and yielding, long preserving the moistness of clouds and winds, while the earth’s terrain is solid and enduring—only the sound of metal and stone is heard. Solidity can be shattered, while yielding never stagnates. When the supreme Dao governs, the weak naturally dwell in the lower currents, while the strong suffer mutilation as an omen of misfortune, eye-gouging as a fate of rebellion. Jié Lì (截离) deceived them—why did he kill his own son for another? Dào Zhì (盗婿) was foolish—why did he defy his father and brother, boasting of his valor? Do they not know that all phenomena are transient, and humility and yielding prevail? Without relying on divination, they naturally follow the Dao like Sūn Zhū (孙叔). The waters swirl in the hollows, and withered leaves scatter like wind. The *Jìn Bì* (晋鄙) was buried with an iron hammer, and *Jì Lún* (季伦) met his end with a golden axe. Regret comes too late—whose fault is this?",

      "translated_text": "Better to preserve true purity in tranquil stillness,\nwhere fame and gain are utterly severed—\nhonor and splendor as fleeting as spring dreams,\nwealth and nobility like passing clouds—\nthen the gentle and yielding attain longevity,\nwhile the empty-hearted ascend as immortals.\n\nHuman life begins in yielding softness,\nyet ends in rigid strength.\n**Commentary:** When life begins, it is soft and weak;\nwhen death comes, it is stiff and hard.\nAll things—grasses and trees—are tender when they grow,\nyet wither and decay when they die.\nThus, those who are rigid and strong are doomed to death,\nwhile those who are yielding and weak belong to life.\n\nThe yielding softness of life preserves the harmony of *qi*.\nThe rigid strength of death scatters the harmony of *qi*.\nTo clarify: those who guard their yielding softness\npreserve life and extend years.\nThose who rely on rigid strength\nlose their bodies and their nature.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nWhen life begins, the harmony of *qi* flows through all limbs,\nmaking the body soft and weak.\nWhen death comes, the harmony of *qi* disperses,\nand the limbs grow stiff and strong.\nThis is shown to teach that yielding softness and rigid strength\nare the warnings of life and death.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nWhen life begins, it is soft and weak—\nthe harmony of *qi* is contained within,\nand the spirit is embraced.\nWhen death comes, it is rigid and strong—\nthe harmony of *qi* is exhausted,\nand the spirit departs.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nNothing is softer and weaker than *qi*,\nand nothing is softer and weaker than the Dao.\nThus, when humans are born, they must rely on the Dao.\nIf *qi* is preserved, bending and stretching are as one’s will;\nif the Dao is upheld, movement and stillness follow the spirit.\nThe heart obeys without resistance,\nand all actions proceed without obstruction—\nthus is yielding softness spoken of.\nIf one cannot preserve *qi*, it will be exhausted,\nand the body will perish.\nIf one does not nurture the spirit, it will depart,\nand life will end—\nand when life ends, the body perishes,\nand movement becomes impossible—\nthus is rigid strength spoken of.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**\nWhen life begins, it is soft and weak;\nwhen death comes, it is rigid and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—are soft and tender when they live,\nyet wither and decay when they die.\nThis is because when alive, the harmony of *qi* is present,\nand when dead, the harmony of *qi* departs.\nThis analogy of sentient and insentient beings\nis meant to exhort learners to abandon rigidity and embrace yielding.\n\n**Second Analogy, Distinguishing Superiority and Inferiority:**\nAll things—grasses and trees—are soft and tender when they grow,\nyet wither and decay when they die.\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThis is an analogy.\nWhen things grow, *qi* gathers, and their branches and leaves unfold in softness.\nWhen they die, *qi* is exhausted, and their stems and branches wither and decay.\nEarlier, the sentient was explained;\nnow, the insentient is illustrated.\nThe insentient thrive or decay by the gathering or scattering of *qi*,\nwhile the sentient live or die by the presence or absence of the Dao.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nWhen grasses and trees grow, they are soft and tender—\nthe harmony of *qi* is present.\nWhen they die, they wither—\nthe harmony of *qi* departs.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nInsentient things live because they have *qi*,\nand die because they lack it.\nThus, it is known that sentient beings\nretain life through yielding softness and the Dao,\nand fall into rigidity and strength when they lose it.\nThus, those who are rigid and strong are doomed to death,\nwhile those who are yielding and weak belong to life.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThis concludes the earlier meaning.\nSince grasses and trees are soft and tender when alive,\nyet rigid and strong when dead,\nit is clear that those who act with rigid strength\nare of the class of death,\nwhile those who act with yielding softness\nare of the class of life.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nObserving these two cases,\none knows that rigid strength leads to death,\nwhile yielding softness leads to life.\n\n**Yan (严) says:**\nWhen life begins, it is soft and weak—\nthe spirit dwells within the body,\nand blood and *qi* flow freely,\nmaking bones weak and sinews supple,\nso that movement and stillness, bending and stretching,\nare all effortless.\nWhen death comes, the spirit departs from the body,\nand the form withers like a dried orange.\nThe tongue shrinks, the body stiffens—\nthis is rigidity and strength.\nAgain, yielding softness is like infancy,\nwhile rigidity and strength are like youth—\nwhen blood and *qi* are at their peak,\ndecay and old age approach,\nbones wither, sinews tighten,\nappetite fades,\nand death is near.\nRigidity and strength lead to ruin,\nwhile yielding softness grows stronger each day.\nHumans are thus, and so are grasses and trees.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nThis concludes the distinction between sentient and insentient,\nlife and death,\neach with their own categories.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**\n\"Category\" here means \"kind.\"\nThus, those who act with rigid strength\ncontradict the harmony of nature,\nand so belong to the class of death.\nThose who act with yielding softness\nalign with the harmony of *qi*,\nand so belong to the class of life.\nThis is the analogy.\n\n**Third Method: Presenting the Affliction and Reinforcing the Earlier Meaning:**\nThus, armies that rely on strength do not conquer.\n**Commentary:** Those who pity prevail,\nso those who depend on strength must fail.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThis continues to reinforce the earlier meaning.\nIn warfare, it is said that mercy is the foundation,\nhence, \"armies that rely on strength are ineffective.\"\nThis is to show that those who rely on strength in life\nare doomed to die.\n\n**River Master (河上公) says:**\nStrong armies are reckless in battle,\ndelight in killing,\nand spread hatred and resentment.\nThe weak unite against them,\nand thus the strong do not conquer.\n\n**Yan (严) says:**\nEnemies who rely on strength\nplunder lands and wealth,\ndestroy ancestral temples,\nand ruin the state,\nseeking to display their might.\nThose who oppose them die,\nand those who serve them face ruin.\nIn life, they are a scourge to the world;\nin death, they benefit the world.\nThe weak unite against them,\nand the strong are isolated—\nthus, they do not conquer.\n\n**Honor (荣) says:**\nThus, armies that rely on strength do not conquer,\nand rigid trees are prone to splitting.\nIf one does not rely on virtue to endure,\nbut instead depends on arms for strength,\nthen strength becomes a scourge to the world,\nand killing is what all detest.\nThe few unite against the many,\nand the weak support the weak—\nthus, the strong are attacked from all sides,\nand do not conquer.\nThis is why rigid trees split,\nand strong pillars collapse beneath their weight.\nThrough such analogies,\nit is made clear that one should cultivate virtue\nand embrace yielding softness,\nrather than adorn oneself with arms and rigidity.",

      "translated_text": "**○ Cheng Shu’s Commentary:**\nThus, armies that are strong do not conquer, and rigid trees are prone to collapse—*armies* referring to the Three Poisons and the Six Roots. It speaks of those who indulge the Six Passions, violently oppress others, and take without restraint—such men will inevitably suffer grave calamity and ruin, hence they do not conquer.\n\nLike coarse, rigid trees, their branches press downward upon them, just as grand beams and rafters bear weight above. Thus, rigidity invites collapse.\n\n**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**\nThe root of the tree is strong and great, so it rests below, while the branches, being supple and weak, grow above. This is why the weak and yielding occupy the upper position, while the strong and rigid are beneath.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nIt states: *\"The root of the tree is strong and great, so it rests below; the branches, being supple and weak, grow above.\"* This is taken to mean that the weak and yielding occupy the upper position, while the strong and rigid are beneath—that is why the following passage states as such.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe tree is strong and great, yet its branches grow above it. The strong and great are beneath, while the weak and yielding are above.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nThis concludes the meaning of the previous passage—that the root of the tree is strong and great, yet its branches grow above it. It seeks to illustrate that those who are strong and rigid are always beneath the weak and yielding.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen constructing works and achieving feats, great trees are placed below, while lesser things are placed above. This is the natural order of Heaven—suppressing the strong and aiding the weak.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe Dao of the Divine and Mysterious: the small does not bear the great, the light does not bear the heavy. Why? Because the strong man is a burden to the world. Strong trees, rooted below, wither from the base—this clearly shows that the strong man cannot become king.\n\n**Rong says:**\nLife is what all delight in; the weak and yielding are the companions of life—are they not above? Death is what all lament; the firm and strong are the companions of death—are they not below?\n\n**Cheng Shu:**\nFirm and strong trees dwell beneath, while supple branches rise above. Thus, the firm and strong man resides in the Nine Abysses below, while the weak and yielding scholar ascends to the Three Purities above.\n\n---\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThis chapter follows the previous one, which expounded on the superiority and inferiority of hardness and softness, urging people to learn. Thus, this chapter further elucidates the principles of gain and loss in hardness and softness to encourage study. Within this chapter, the meaning is divided into three parts: first, an introductory analogy illustrating high and low; second, a direct exposition expounding on gain and loss; third, citing the Sage to conclude the meaning.\n\n**First: The Introductory Analogy, Briefly Illustrating High and Low**\nThe common folk are ignorant; direct speech is difficult to grasp. One must use analogies to make it clear. The Dao of Heaven is boundless and intangible, beyond the reach of human perception. To comprehend its intent, consider the archer’s bow: whether high or low, it strikes true; whether near or far, it finds its mark. Zhang Heng’s skill moved the wind and birds ten thousand *li* away; Emperor Wu’s talent startled the clouds and geese across three autumns. They respond to the moment, never missing their mark. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive, while human affairs reduce the deficient. Heaven and man employ opposite methods—gain and loss diverge. Who can fathom the primordial *qi*, vast and unfathomable, the Mysterious Origin, remote and boundless? Within it lies true stillness, yet transformation arises spontaneously. It does not rely on man to aid Heaven, nor does it depend on the mind to diminish the Dao.\n\nSoaring nine *wan* *li* on the wind, the Great Peng flies freely; plunging three thousand *li* into the waters, the *Kun* swims alone. Speaking of the bow and arrows, all shots find their mark; speaking of suppression and elevation, none exceed their place. Like the *xiao* flute, when Princess Pingyu plays, the floating clouds are ensnared; like the *qin* zither, when played by the Maoshan recluse, flowing waters become melody. This is the harmony of heart and reason, attainable and complete—only the man of the Dao can grasp its profound mystery.\n\nIs not the Dao of Heaven like the archer’s bow?\n\n**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao of Heaven is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the archer’s bow is cited to reveal its function.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nHere, two analogies are employed. The Dao of Heaven is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the archer’s bow is used to manifest Heaven’s virtue. The method of the bow is fully explained below.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and clear; it employs analogies from things to make itself known.\n\n**Rong says:**\nHuman affairs are near and shallow; one faces them yet cannot discern their essence. The Dao of Heaven is distant and deep; one gazes upward yet cannot perceive its principles. The confused are easily enlightened, but the true path is difficult to understand. Thus, the analogy of the archer’s bow is borrowed to illustrate it.\n\n**Cheng Shu:**\nThe Dao of Heaven—is it not like the archer’s bow? Those who are high are suppressed, those who are low are elevated—this is the analogy. The natural order, like the bow, raises the low to make them high and suppresses the high to make them low. Only when high and low are properly balanced can the arrow be released.\n\nThose who are high are suppressed, those who are low are elevated; the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\n\n**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**\nThe bow must be drawn thus to strike true—just as the Dao of Heaven, through humility and moderation, seeks to guide the ruler in harmonizing with Heaven and people.\n\n**Yu Shu:**\nThe bow’s function requires proper tension and alignment, ensuring the bowstring is neither too tight nor too slack. To suppress the high and elevate the low is to prepare the arrow for its true path. To diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient is to adjust for distance—thus, the shot finds its mark.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is the same: the sun and moon, cold and heat, come and go in turn. When they come, they diminish the excessive; when they depart, they supplement the deficient—thus, the year’s work is complete.\n\nThe ruler must follow the Dao of Heaven: suppress the strong, aid the weak, diminish the advantageous, and benefit the disadvantaged. Thus, the principles of humility and moderation are held up, urging the ruler to govern with equity and balance.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nIt speaks of the bow’s harmonious balance—only thus can it be used. To suppress the high and elevate the low, to diminish the strong and supplement the weak—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe bow’s function lies in harmony. If the bowstring is too taut, it must be loosened; if too slack, it must be tightened.",

      "translated_text": "The rest is thus: carve away the excessive, and supplement what is deficient. When the bowstring and arrow shaft align in their proper measure, harmony is achieved—thus, the bow can be drawn and the arrow released.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe Way of using the bow is this: if it is too high, suppress it so it does not exceed; if too low, elevate it so it does not fall short. Neither exceeding nor falling short—this is the middle standard.\n\nFor those who govern the realm, they must diminish the excessive wealth of the rich and augment the deficient wealth of the poor. The poor, receiving aid, are no longer poor; the rich, though diminished, remain rich—this is the middle standard of governance.\n\nToo high risks emptiness and distance; suppress it so it does not become void. Too low risks stagnation and obstruction; elevate it so it does not become blocked. Neither blocked nor void—this aligns with the **Middle Dao**.\n\n**The Second Proper Explanation: Broadly Clarifying Diminish and Supplement.**\nThe excessive must be diminished; the deficient must be given to.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\nThose who are arrogant and proud with excess must invite ruin; those who are humble and meek with deficiency will be granted blessings. The Dao of Heaven is thus, and so it is likened to drawing the bow.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThe Great Dao applies equity, aiding the many and benefiting the few. But humanity reverses this, diminishing the deficient instead.\n\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nThis clarifies how humanity cannot match Heaven’s diminish and supplement. The words *\"aid the many and benefit the few\"* are from the *I Ching*’s **\"Qian\" (谦, Humility) Hexagram**.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and benefits the humble, always valuing harmony and moderation as supreme.\n\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so—it opposes the Dao of Heaven.\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Common folk diminish the poor to serve the rich, plunder the weak to benefit the strong.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient, using Heaven’s Dao as an analogy.\n\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so—it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. This speaks of how humanity’s actions oppose Heaven’s Dao: instead of diminishing the strong and benefiting the weak, it extinguishes the poor and increases the rich.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient. This is the natural principle of bestowing blessings upon the virtuous and calamities upon the licentious, continuing from what was said earlier.\n\nYet the Dao of humanity is not so—it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. In human affairs, the inclination is to indulge in licentiousness and deceit, to vie with others in worldly pursuits, thus opposing Heaven’s Dao and reason. They strip the poor and lowly of what little they have, offering it to the wealthy and noble who already possess excess.\n\nWho can truly use their own excess to benefit all under Heaven? Only the **Daoist ruler**.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nWho can use their own excess to aid those deficient across the world? Only the **Daoist ruler** can do so.\n\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\n*Who*—meaning *who among men*? The **Laozi** laments that the age cannot follow Heaven’s Dao, yet he seeks to relieve humanity. He magnifies the **Daoist ruler’s virtue**, thus citing Heaven’s Dao to exhort: Who can practice Heaven’s Dao, diminishing their own excess to bestow upon those deficient? Only the **Daoist ruler** can achieve this.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWho can occupy a position of excess and reflect upon their rank and wealth to aid those deficient across the world? Only the **Daoist ruler** can carry this out.\n\n**Rong says:**\nWho can model their conduct after Heaven’s Dao, diminishing the excessive and supplementing the humble? The **Daoist ruler** must be capable of such actions.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\n*Who*—meaning *who among men*? Who can possess both wealth and virtue to bestow upon all under Heaven? Only those who embrace the Dao can truly aid others, hence the following line: *\"The Sage does not accumulate.\"*\n\nAnd it says *\"to serve\"*—this is to show humility.\n\n**The Third Proper Explanation: Illustrating the Sage and Concluding the Meaning.**\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage follows Heaven’s Dao, applying equity and balance in his actions. His virtue extends to all, yet he does not claim credit for his deeds.\n\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nThis introduces the Sage to validate the earlier notion of the **Daoist ruler**. *\"Rely on\"* means *\"to boast or take pride in.\"* The Sage, following Heaven’s Dao and applying equity, extends his virtue to all without seeking recognition, hence *\"does not rely.\"*\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe Sage acts in virtue and benevolence, not awaiting reward or acknowledgment.\n\n**Rong says:**\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it—his achievements are not his own, and so he is not esteemed for his wisdom. The Sage acts in virtue without expecting reward, accomplishes things without claiming credit—this is why he does so: to conceal his **sage virtue** and obscure his **accomplished talent**, lest the people see his wisdom and ability. Since the ruler acts thus, the subjects follow suit, and the strife for renown is naturally removed; the concern for being overlooked ceases to arise.\n\n**Zheng’s Annotation:**\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it—his achievements are not his own. He does not wish to display his wisdom.\n\nThe Sage, embodying the Dao, is always good at rescuing and benefiting others. Though he bestows both wealth and virtue, he does not rely on his efforts. Even with great accomplishments, he does not claim credit—his intent is to exalt humility, to retreat from glory, and to conceal his light and obscure his traces, not desiring that others see his wisdom and ability.\n\n**Achievements without claiming credit.**\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage knows that if he claims credit for his achievements, Heaven will diminish them. Thus, even though his Dao spreads across the world and his deeds benefit all, he attributes the praise to the common people, yet does not claim the credit himself.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nWhen achievements are complete and matters are settled, he does not hold onto his position. He does not wish to display his wisdom.\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:**\nThis concludes the meaning of *\"does not rely\"* and *\"does not claim.\"* He who does not wish to display his wisdom—though the Sage may possess abundant inner virtue and fine outward reputation—his reason for not relying on his actions or claiming credit is precisely to conceal his virtue and obscure his name, not desiring that others see his wisdom and ability. This is also the meaning of *\"diminishing the excessive.\"*",

Since the prior chapter expounded on diminishing and augmenting, this chapter uses water as an analogy to illustrate the power of softness and weakness.\n\nWithin this chapter, the meaning unfolds in three parts: first, the analogy begins, clarifying that softness excels strength and weakness overcomes force; second, the analogy is applied, lamenting the common inability to practice it; third, the Sage is cited as proof, demonstrating the true Dao.\n\n**First, the analogy begins, clarifying that softness excels strength and weakness overcomes force:**\nThe highest virtue is humble and soft—nothing surpasses water. The great artisan takes his standard from it; the virtuous person’s mind flows like water toward the east into rivers, while Confucius marveled at its ceaseless passage. The southern currents converge at the lowly ditches, and Guo Pu praised its boundless spirit.\n\nWhen autumn waters first rise, they cannot distinguish between cattle and horses; when winter ice first forms, it listens to the calls of foxes and rabbits. Crossing the Yellow River in a small boat, returning to the sea upon a raft. The virtue of softness and weakness triumphs over hardness and strength—white stones boil in cauldrons of stone until they turn to mud, yellow gold is refined into powder by water’s embrace. All these are the power of water, unmatched by any, making it the sovereign of the world. It must be called *\"lonely and solitary\"* (孤寡), bearing the filth of the land, yet truly it is auspicious.\n\nSpeaking of fish, they do not wish their bodies to grow fat; riding cranes, one must have a slender frame. The noble person exchanges with others in simplicity to compare virtue, while the spirit of clarity is marked by pouring and measuring. A loyal subject can summon wind and rain, and a virtuous wife, if reverent and filial, will have the courtyard fountain flow of itself.\n\nOh, how vast is water’s meaning!\n\nWhen one acts, he must dwell in tranquility and harmony, not imposing himself upon others. He must yield and adapt, following the Way of things. Water’s nature is pure and reflective—how can I not take virtue from it?\n\n**The soft and the weak of the world have none greater than water.**\nYet in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can surpass it.\n\n**Tang Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary:**\nTo break hardness with hardness, both must be diminished. But when softness strikes strength, the strong are broken while the soft remain whole. Thus, in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can rival water.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nWater’s nature is to descend without contention, moving or still according to the time, conforming to square or round vessels. Therefore, when speaking of the soft and the weak of the world, none surpass water. Yet in overcoming hardness and strength, water cannot be rivaled—though water is soft, it can erode stone, and though stone is hard, it cannot harm water. If hardness attacks hardness, both are damaged; if water attacks stone, stone is worn away while water remains unharmed. Hence, in overcoming hardness and subduing strength, nothing precedes water—this is why it is said that none can surpass it.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe soft and the weak of the world have none greater than water—when contained in a round vessel, it is round; when in a square vessel, it is square. Block it, and it stops; unblock it, and it flows. Yet in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can surpass it. Water can embrace mountains and nourish hills, wear away iron and dissolve copper—none can overcome water and achieve success.\n\n**Rong says:**\nObserving all things, summarizing all existence, the ultimate soft and weak is water. It dissolves gold and stone, breaks hills and mounds—none can surpass water. In the method of breaking hardness and strength, since water is supreme, there is none to replace it. For governing the body, if one can take humility as virtue and the Dao as application, he can surely break strong adversaries and vanquish the fierce. The Dao must come first, so there is none to replace it. In cultivating oneself, if one can uphold the utmost softness and weakness, he can break the hard and strong. I grasp the principle of dwelling in emptiness and stillness, surpassing all disputes of right and wrong, and only the Dao can prevail—none can substitute for it.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nNo thing is as soft and weak as water, and no hardness and strength surpasses gold and stone. Yet water, though soft and weak, has boundless utility, and in overcoming hardness and strength, it is unmatched. The principle of breaking the hard with the soft is the same—its meaning is timeless.\n\nThere is none to replace it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThough water is the softest, in overcoming hardness and strength, none can replace it. Is this not because it possesses the virtue of non-contention and lacks the desire to hold onto victory? Governing the state and cultivating oneself must also be so.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nIn overcoming hardness and strength, there is none to replace water.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWater can naturally overcome hardness and strength—this is the unchanging principle of breaking the hard with the soft, a truth that will never fade through the ages.\n\n**Second, the analogy is applied, lamenting the common inability to practice it:**\nThough softness overcomes strength and weakness triumphs over force, the world knows it not, nor can it practice it.\n\n**Tang Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary:**\nThe Dao of softness and weakness surpasses that of hardness and strength, yet the world knows it not and cannot practice it.\n\n**Imperial Exegesis:**\nThe Dao of softness and weakness surpasses that of hardness and strength. All people know this principle, but they are confused by their own perceived superiority, valuing themselves above others, and cannot put into practice what they already know. This is why it is said that they cannot practice it.\n\n**He Shang Gong says:**\nThe triumph of weakness over strength is seen in how water extinguishes fire and how darkness consumes light. The victory of softness over hardness is seen in how the tongue, soft yet flexible, precedes the rigid teeth—teeth are broken before the tongue perishes. The world knows this well: weakness endures, while strength and force are injured. Yet none can practice it, for they are ashamed of humility and prefer the glory of force.\n\n**Rong says:**\nMany favor strength and force, few preserve softness and weakness—they cannot retreat in humility, always striving to be first among things.\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\nWater can overcome gold and stone, so it is known that softness triumphs over hardness and strength. This is understood by both the wise and the foolish, yet all the world cannot follow it in practice.",

Hence, he is called the steward of the ancestral altars.\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—*xiáng* means ‘good.’ If a ruler practices humility and softness, bearing the state’s ills and assuming the titles ‘Orphaned, Lonely, and Unworthy,’ then the Four Seas will turn toward virtue, and he is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**River Upper Master (Hé Shànggōng) says:**\n*\"Thus, the Sage speaks—this is addressing the subjects below.\nTo bear the filth of the state and uphold the ancestral altars’ master: if a ruler can bear the state’s turbid defilements, like the rivers and seas not resisting the inflow of streams, then he can long preserve the ancestral altars and be the state’s sovereign.\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—a ruler who takes faults upon himself and bears the calamities of the people can thus reign over all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**Yán says:**\n*\"To endure what others find shameful and bear it.\nWhat others hate, when it becomes the people’s great calamity, is not taken as virtue—yet if it leads to the loss of the state, it does not lose the Mandate of Heaven.

Though one passes through goodness and evil, both are harmonized.\nIlluminating the original stillness of one principle, establishing that all phenomena are empty—this suffices to realize the Dao and become the Law-King.\nFrom the perspective of convention, filth and goodness are distinct, and the mind perceives them as real.\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, all is empty, hence it is said to be inverted.\"*\n\n**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**\n*\"Thus, the Sage bears the filth of the state and is called the steward of the ancestral altars—*guó* means ‘the domain of the state,’ and *rǔ* means ‘disgrace.’\nThe one who embodies the Dao, dwelling in the world, practices humility, softness, and weakness, reaching the point of yielding and compliance, bearing humiliation without contending with others—this is worthy of being the steward of the ancestral altars to shepherd the people.\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—thus, *bùxiáng* is the same as ‘not good.’\nThe Sage’s spiritual insight is vast and penetrating, reaching into goodness and evil. If there are misfortunes in the state, he immediately blames himself and takes the faults upon himself—this is worthy of being the sovereign of all under Heaven. The case of Tāng setting fire to his granaries to summon distant aid is an example.\nEarlier, it was said that the ancestral altars could be entrusted to the feudal lords; now, it is said that all under Heaven should belong to the sovereign of all under Heaven.\nRectitude in speech is as if inverted.\"*\n\n**御注:**\n*\"To bear the filth of the state is to be the steward of the ancestral altars; to bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven.

The common people all love goodness and honor, yet now one bears defilement and ills, which seems inverted.\nYet the phrase ‘as if inverted’ (*rú fǎn*) aims to clarify that though it appears inverted, it is not truly so—though it seems inverted, it is not. Though it seems inverted, it is not. It constantly aligns with convention, not truly inverted, yet aligning with convention in truth.\nIt is said that the profound virtue is deep and distant, contrary to things, and only then does it reach the greatest harmony—this is its meaning.\"*\n\n**Chapter on Harmonizing Great Grievances (Chapter 79)**\nThe chapter on *Harmonizing Great Grievances* follows the previous one because the prior chapter broadly expounds on hardness and softness, yet even at its utmost, it has not fully penetrated to forgetfulness.

Though one departs from the two extremes, one has not yet ascended to the Dao’s peak.\n2. The Sage’s empty unity and mysterious correspondence with the *Double Mystery*.\n3.

Hence, it is called *harmonizing great grievances*.\nThere will inevitably be lingering grievances—once a doctrine is established to guide the people, traces of it must remain, and these traces will still breed grievances. Thus, lingering grievances arise.\n\n**Further Commentary:**\nAt first, humanity was born with a pure and tranquil mind, but now they are entangled in the dusty realm, straying from the Dao and falling into corruption—all due to the influence of passions. Thus, the greatest grievance for the body is indeed passion.\n*Harmonize* means to reconcile and adjust.\nThe people, already ensnared by passion and thus giving rise to deceit, cannot be transformed by the ruler’s passive non-action. If he instead establishes doctrine and law to curb their treachery and adjust them toward harmony, it is called *harmonizing great grievances*.\nYet lingering grievances remain—once laws and doctrines are set, their traces cannot be entirely erased, and these traces will still provoke grievances. Hence, lingering grievances persist.\n\n**River Master’s Saying:**\nTo *harmonize great grievances*, one must let the killer face death and the wounder receive punishment—this is the way of mutual retaliation.\nThere will inevitably be lingering grievances, for those who enforce punishments will lose the people’s trust, and lingering grievances will extend even to the innocent.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\nTo *harmonize great grievances* is to invite lingering grievances—how can this be considered good? When all things are unified in their natural state, right and wrong dissolve. Yet when distinctions arise and conflicts ensue, great grievances take form.\nThus, rituals include the duty of repaying grievances, and laws prescribe punishments for crimes. Grievances come and go, never ceasing. If one seeks to extinguish them by reconciling and adjusting, it is to invert the natural order—making them follow what is unnatural. When people outwardly comply but inwardly resist, or speak well while harboring ill will, lingering grievances and resentments only grow. This is to invite further evil—how can it be called good?\nIf one truly desires goodness, it is better to refrain from provoking grievances. If grievances are not provoked, there is no need for reconciliation or adjustment. When both inversion and compliance are forgotten, great grievances naturally cease. Only then, when one does not know what is called good, can it be named *the utmost good*.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*Grievances* are oppositions—this encompasses all distinctions of good and evil, presence and absence, and every principle that requires opposition.\nThough one may reconcile the oppositions of having and not having, achieving neither having nor not having, and thus harmonize the two extremes into a singular middle, this is still the realm of *Xuan* (the Mysterious), not yet the essence of *Double Mystery*.\nThis is a state of *non-dependence*, yet one has not yet attained *absolute non-dependence*—this is *dependence on singularity*, not yet *singularity without dependence*. Hence, lingering oppositions remain.\nHow can this be considered *the utmost good*?\n\n**Commentary:**\nOnce lingering grievances arise, how can one still claim to act in *the utmost good*?\nThe traces of laws and doctrines inevitably lead to lingering grievances—thus, how can they be called *the utmost good*? This is merely the nature of goodness in learning, striving to restore the original purity.\nIf one ascends to the transformation of pure tranquility, doing nothing and attending to nothing, the people will naturally adopt simplicity and sincerity, and the traces of lingering grievances will vanish. Only then can one truly be called *the utmost good*.\n\n**River Master’s Saying:**\nIf one person sighs in complaint, the harmony of Heaven is lost—how can reconciling grievances be considered *the utmost good*?\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary:**\n*How* can this be *the utmost good*?\nThough one may abandon the two extremes, one has not yet forgotten the singular middle—thus, how can one fully attain *the utmost good*?\n\n**Second: The Sage’s empty gathering and his wondrous correspondence with the *Double Mystery*.**\n\nTherefore, the Sage holds the *Left Contract* and does not blame the people.\n**Commentary:**\n*The Left Contract* refers to the mind.\nThe mind is the *yang* repository, binding with the external realm—thus it is called the *Left Contract*.\nThe Sage knows that establishing doctrine will inevitably leave traces, and these traces will still breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he holds fast to this mind, making it pure and tranquil, and transforms the people through its power. Thus, their passions are eliminated, and they do not need to be punished—they naturally align with non-action.\n\n**Further Commentary:**\n*The Left Contract* refers to the mind.\nThe mind is the *yang* repository, binding with the external realm—thus it is called the *Left Contract*.\nThe Sage knows that establishing doctrine will inevitably leave traces, and these traces will still breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he holds fast to this mind, ensuring it does not scatter or become confused, and transforms the people through its power. Thus, their passions are eliminated, and they do not need to be punished—they naturally align with non-action.\n\n**River Master’s Saying:**\nTherefore, the Sage holds the *Left Contract*—in ancient times, the Sage held the *Left Contract*, which was a pledge of mutual trust.\nWithout written laws, they carved contracts and pledges into wood as tokens of faith.\nYet he did not blame the people—only the tokens of the *Left Contract* were enforced; no other punishments were imposed.\n\n**Yan’s Commentary:**\n*Contract* is a token of trust.\nThe Sage holds the Dao’s token and wields the virtue’s pledge, uniting them within himself and not blaming others.\nThus, when he would act, he first aligned with Heaven; when he would move, he verified with the tokens of trust.\nHe sought faults within himself, never reproached others.\nHe attributed blame to himself, never to others.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\nIn ancient times, the Sage carved contracts into wood—the ruler held the left, the subject the right—as tokens of trust.\nThey bound the people to the contracts and pledges, without further laws or punishments.

affairs,\nthe Sage’s subtle contract embraces the world,\nthus he can rectify and guide the myriad peoples,\nyet speaks of no blame—\nfor though the Sage rectifies and guides all beings,\nhe forgets his virtue,\ntreating the people as straw dogs.\nHence, he does not demand their gratitude in return.\n\n**The Third Distinction:** The difference between *de* and *non-de* lies in *holding* and *forgetting*.\n\nThus, the virtuous ruler governs by *contract*,\nwhile the unvirtuous governs by *simplicity*.\n**Yu’s Annotation:** *Govern* means *to master*.\n*Simplicity* means *to permeate*.\nThe virtuous ruler masters the *heart-contract*,\nand thus the people transform of themselves.\nThe unvirtuous ruler, unable to empty his heart and forget himself,\nseeks only to impose laws to permeate the people—\nand where laws are made, harm arises.\nHence, he is without virtue.\n\n**Yu’s Citation:**\nThe virtuous ruler governs by *contract*—\nthe virtuous sovereign merely oversees the *contract of trust*.\nThe unvirtuous ruler governs by *simplicity*—\nthe unvirtuous sovereign abandons the *contract of trust* and oversees what is lost.\n\n**Yan’s Commentary:**\n*Simplicity* may also be read as *slaughter*.\nThe unvirtuous ruler’s governance brings disorder and chaos;\nhe does not seek faults within himself,\nbut only oversees the people’s transgressions,\ndriving them with harsh punishments—\nthus, families bear guilt and crimes abound.\nThe virtuous ruler, however, determines right and wrong within himself,\ndistinguishing black from white without action—\nbefore he moves, the world responds;\nbefore he commands, the world complies.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\n*Govern* means *to master*.\n*Contract* means *unity*.\n*Simplicity* means *dispersion*.\nThe virtuous ruler’s governance stems from his heart,\nharmonizing with the Dao of *non-action*,\nmysteriously one above, drawing all things below.\nHis trust is the *contract of unity*.\nBut if unvirtuous, he fails to practice goodness,\nneither holding to the Dao’s *contract*\nnor uniting the people—\nthus, they scatter.\nWithin, the virtuous ruler aligns with principle,\nhence *governs by contract*;\nthe unvirtuous defies truth,\nhence *governs by simplicity*.\n\n**Cheng’s Citation:**\n*Govern* means *to master*.\n*Simplicity* means *trace*.\nThe virtuous ruler’s subtle governance does not cling to names or words,\nwhile the unvirtuous, still entangled in *qi* and form,\ncannot penetrate and release—\ntheir traces remain unvanquished,\nhence *governs by simplicity*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven knows no favoritism—\nit always aligns with the virtuous.\n**Yu’s Annotation:**\nTo govern by *contract* is to remain pure and unspoiled;\nto legislate is to bring decay and ruin.\nHeaven favors none—\nit aids only virtue.\nThus, the sovereign must always cultivate purity through *non-action*,\nnever legislate and create strife.\n\n**Yu’s Citation:**\nThough Heaven’s way is impartial in its bestowal,\nit does not deceive the virtuous—\nthose who govern by *contract* attain purity,\nand Heaven blesses their goodness with unending benefit.\nBut those who legislate bring harm,\nand Heaven visits calamity upon them—\nwho cannot escape?\nIs this not proof that Heaven favors none,\naiding only virtue?\n\n**He Shang Gong’s Saying:**\nThe Dao of Heaven knows no near or far—\nit aids only the virtuous,\nwhich is to govern by *contract*.\n\n**Rong’s Commentary:**\nHeaven’s way is equal, knowing no near or far.\nThe wicked stray from the path, thus distant;\nthe virtuous draw near to truth, thus close.\nSpeaking of ultimate principle,\nit is neither distant nor near—\nonly those who practice virtue are blessed by Heaven,\nhence it is said to *aid the virtuous*.\nYet it aids the virtuous while abandoning the unvirtuous—\nthus, one knows that Heaven aids virtue,\nnot the lack thereof.\nIf one walks the path of virtue,\nvirtue naturally returns to them.\n\n**Cheng’s Citation:**\nHeaven’s true principle knows no near or far.\nThe supremely virtuous naturally harmonize with it—\nthis is the same as holding the left *contract*\nand not blaming the people.\n\n---\n**The Chapter on Small States and Few People**\nThis chapter follows the previous because,\nthough the prior displayed the two *mysteries*’ essence,\nits practice was not yet complete.\nThus, this chapter clarifies entering the great through the small.\n\nWithin this chapter, the text unfolds in four layers:\nFirst, it illuminates the *xiao xue* (small learning) person,\nwho does not enter the realm of dust;\nSecond, it speaks of emptying the heart to verify principle,\nabandoning teaching and forgetting *qi*;\nThird, it returns to ancient purity,\nharmonizing light and blending with customs;\nFourth, it embodies truth and unites with the Dao,\ntranscending all comings and goings.\n\n**First Layer: The *xiao xue* Person Does Not Enter the Dusty Realm**\nIn the age of the Flaming Han,\nthe sovereign merely harmonized with *endurance and repose*;\nin the time of Xi and Nong,\npeople simply adhered to *non-action*.\nThey dwelled in caves to avoid wind and frost,\nnested in trees to evade summer’s heat.\nA woman conceived once every fifteen years,\nand lived nearly a hundred before death.\nThey died piled on kindling,\nand lived cradling their food at the breast—\nhow could there be great states claiming empire,\nsmall states claiming subjecthood,\nwhere officials did not aid in planning,\nand Feng Huo did not apply his wisdom?\nWho calculated the *shi-bo* tools,\nwho served as magistrates?\n\nThough they had boats and carriages,\nthey abandoned them by rivers and plains;\nthough they had armor and weapons,\nthey stored them away and did not use them.\nThe transformation of knotted cords was lofty,\nthe wind of *ya* music reached its peak—\nthe old died without mutual visits,\nuntil the later age of chaos and peril,\nwhen kings waged war,\nYin overthrew Xia’s governance,\nZhou invaded the Zhou dynasty,\nand Yi Yin carried a cauldron to counsel the release of Jie,\nwhile Liang Si wore a jade to deceive Qin.\nQin Shi Huang demoted King Zhou of Zhou to commoner,\nLiu Yu bound Emperor Gong of Jin to a pillar—\nministers usurped the sovereign’s power.\nAlas, who could endure it?\nHow could they know

all clothing beautiful.\nIf not moderate and fitting, even jade-like delicacies and brocade garments\ncannot truly be called sweet and beautiful.\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Sweet their food\"* means sweet their coarse meals,\nnot plundering the people for fine cuisine.\n*\"Beautiful their clothing\"* means beautiful their rough garments,\nnot prizing the five colors.\n\n**Rong** said:\nSweet their food, beautiful their clothing,\nsettle their dwellings, delight in their customs—\nwhen people’s desires are unfulfilled,\neven jade food and silk brocade are not deemed beautiful.\nBut when the heart finds contentment,\nplain rice and coarse hemp robes suffice as sweetness.\nLet **Tao Sheng** and **Da Jun** transform the world,\nand all shall eat sweetly without distinction of rank.\nClothing shall have no preference for good or ill,\nall garments worn shall be deemed beautiful.\nHomes shall know no poverty or wealth,\nall dwellings shall be deemed settled.\nVillages shall know no excess or want,\nall abodes shall be filled with joy.\nSince none seek distant migration,\nthe weak and bereaved shall find no need to wander.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n*\"Sweet their food\"*—flavor attains the Dao.\n*\"Beautiful their clothing\"*—virtue/power shines in the body.\n*\"Settle their dwellings\"*—delight in their customs.\nThe *Rong*’s Commentary said:\nWithout desire, their dwellings are settled.\nWith simplicity transformed, their customs are joyful.\nIf one pursues desires without restraint,\nhow could they settle in their dwellings?\nHarsh governance and burdens bring only trouble—\nhow could they then delight in their customs?\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Settle their dwellings\"*—settle in thatched huts,\nnot favoring ornate houses.\n*\"Delight in their customs\"*—delight in simple and unadorned ways,\nnot shifting to foreign norms.\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n*\"Settle their dwellings\"*—all places are settled,\nstillness within motion.\n*\"Delight in their customs\"*—harmonizing with the world’s light,\nmotion within stillness.\n\n**Fourthly, it illustrates attaining true Dao/Way and harmonizing with its flow,\nexceeding all coming and going.**\nNeighboring lands face one another,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs reach across them—\nyet the people, until death, never visit one another.\n\nThe *Rong*’s Commentary said:\nNeighboring lands face one another—\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nthis speaks of their closeness.\nThat the people, until death, never visit one another,\nis because each has their own sufficiency,\nand nothing more to seek or give.\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\nNeighboring lands face one another,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nthis marks proximity.\nThe people, until death, never visit one another—\nthis is their lack of emotional attachments.\n\n**Rong** said:\nTwo lands as neighbors, visible to the eye,\nroosters crow and dogs bark, heard by the ear—\nfrom beginning to end, in youth and age,\nthey never visit one another.\nEach person is self-sufficient,\neach home holds the Dao.\nThus it is said:\n*\"People forget the Dao as it spreads,*\n*fish forget the rivers and lakes they dwell in.\"*\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\nNeighboring lands face one another—\n*neighbor* means near,\n*lands* refers to the realms of life and death,\nand the Dao’s domain.\nThis says that these two realms lie close within the heart,\nso they are said to face one another.\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nroosters watch for dawn,\ndogs guard through the night—\nthese teachings serve as warnings against the long night of ignorance,\nand calls to the morning of wisdom.\nThus, these teachings are near in expounding the unity of mind,\nso they are said to be heard.\nThat the people, until death, never visit one another—\nwhen one attains true understanding and harmony,\nthis is the Dao.\nThe Dao is neither born from life and death,\nnor does it depart through any path—\nwhen these two realms merge as one,\nthere is no coming or going,\nno distinction between beginnings and ends.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-One of *Sincere Speech Not Beautiful***\n\n*Sincere Speech*—this chapter is the third section,\nits text summarizing earlier themes.\nWithin this chapter, the meaning is divided into three:\n**Firstly, it shows the virtuous/powerful person,\nwhose wisdom transcends all speech and argument.**\nGood medicine tastes bitter,\nsincere speech is not beautiful,\ngreat eloquence seems dull,\nthe learned do not know all.\nThe Sage scatters Dao/Way to teach the common and foolish,\nyet does not hoard it.\nHe laments the long night of ignorance,\nwhile the foolish and dull remain unaware—\nI, like grass, am but one of these common folk,\nstanding at the edge of the boundless sea of desire,\nyet unable to unfurl my ragged robes.\nBefore the mountain of error, who dares lift a foot?\nThe owl that neither cries nor flies—\nwhen it rises, it soars to the heavens.\nThe man who is both foolish and dull—\nhow could he awaken in a hundred years?\n\nThe Sage labors to point out the Great Dao/Way,\nbut distorts the natural transformations of life.\nIn darkness, they do not know—\nwhat more can be said?\n\nI have privately observed the utmost sincerity,\nrefining the self and governing the realm—\nabove, it ascends to the brilliance of the sun,\nsoaring through the clouds like a bird.\nBelow, it cleanses the intestines and washes the heart,\nleading many to follow in its path.\nTo act without effort is the Dao’s honor—\ndwelling in the source of harmony and balance,\nvirtue/power can nourish all things.\nThe child of a skilled craftsman\nmust first learn to make his own leather coat—\nmy disciples embrace the True,\nso why do they not gather?\n\nMy spirit is weary from yellowed scrolls and shallow learning,\nmy Dao is impoverished by clear streams.\nDay and night, I strive in fear,\nnever ceasing in sleep or waking.\nI regret not attaining the likeness of the Sage,\nnor the colors of his teachings.\nMy wasted bones and tattered soul—\nhow could my sighs ever end?\nThose who share my resolve—\ndo not forget this heart’s intent.\n\n*Sincere speech is not beautiful—*\nThe *Rong*’s Commentary said:\n*Sincere speech*—this refers to the Sage’s teachings,\ntruthful and real.\nLaozi wished to clarify his established teachings,\nto transform and guide all beings,\nand truly, these are words of utmost sincerity—\nyet they conflict with common ways,\nso people deem them not beautiful.\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*Sincere speech*—speech that matches reality.\n*Not beautiful*—simple and unadorned.\n\n**Rong** said:\nSincere speech is not beautiful,\nbeautiful speech is not sincere—\nspeech reveals the heart,\nnot a matter of idle fabrication.\nIt seeks true principles,\nnot flashy words.\nThus it is said: *sincere speech is not beautiful,*\n*sweet words lose truth,*\n*light promises lack substance.*\n\n**Cheng’s Commentary** said:\n*Sincere speech is not beautiful,*\n*beautiful speech is not sincere*—\n*sincere* means real,\n*beautiful* means superficial and gaudy.\nThe virtuous/powerful person, obscured yet in accord with the Dao,\nspeaks teachings that are real without ornamentation.\nSuperficial and gaudy
