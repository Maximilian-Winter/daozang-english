  "full_translation": "**Title:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing*\n\n**Author:** *Tasked by Yin Fu Jing (任照一), likely from the Northern Song dynasty.*\n**Recorded in:** *The Outline of Arts and Literature in the Comprehensive Mirror (通志艺文略).*\n**Volume:** *One scroll.*\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era (正统道藏), in the \"Treasure of Perfect Truth\" (洞真部) under the \"Jade Precepts\" (玉诀类) category.*\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing*:**\n\nThat which the **Dao/Way** holds most precious is **scripture**; that which **scripture** holds most precious is **utterance**; that which **utterance** holds most precious is **meaning**.\n\nThus, the Great **Dao/Way** is beyond words—without **utterance**, one cannot elucidate its principles;\nThe Great **Form/Symbol** is without shape—without **establishing symbols**, one cannot fathom its depths.\n\nThe subtlety of **Form/Symbol** cannot be conveyed without **utterance**;\nThe subtlety of **utterance** cannot be transmitted without **learning**.\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor (Huangdi, 混元皇帝)** once said:\n*\"I learned it and obtained it—this was not something I gained from nature itself.\"*\n\n**Meaning** is something that cannot be discerned without **learning**, nor can one truly grasp the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe marvel of the **One True Principle** is evident in the **Dao/Way’s** essence—\nTo those who do not know it, the heavens and earth may seem distant as the poles;\nTo those who know it, how could it be far from their grasp?\n\nThe **Supreme Truth (Shangzhen, 上真)** is compassionate and benevolent,\nBestowing the **Original Law (Yuǎnfǎ, 元法)** upon the world,\nRescuing all beings from confusion,\nAnd setting forth **teachings** in **utterances**—\nYet even when **utterances** are fully expounded, the principles remain concealed within **meaning**.\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor’s** *Yin Fu Jing* contains over three hundred **utterances**,\nDirectly pointing to the human heart,\nEnabling one to truly observe the **Dao/Way** of heaven and the **Dao/Way** of humanity,\nAnd to grasp the **principle of correspondence (Qìjī, 契机)** in *Yin Fu*.\n\nThus, it states: *\"Observing the **Dao/Way** of heaven, holding fast to heaven’s actions, is complete.\"*\n\nIn my humble ignorance,\nI have perused later generations’ commentaries,\nOnly to find them often forced and contrived,\nNot delving into the true intent of the **scripture**,\nWhere the **utterances** and **meanings** are disjointed—\nThey merely divide the text arbitrarily and speculate wildly,\nLeaving students without guidance.\n\nThough I am unworthy,\nI have dared to offer my own **interpretation**,\nNot presuming to counterfeit the **Sacred Teachings** for the sake of my own words;\nFor only when I have obtained the **utterance of a perfected sage (Zhìrén, 至人)** do I dare—\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing*:**\n**Recorded by the Daoist layman Tasked (道民任照一)**\n\n**Yin (阴):** *darkness, hidden, or the unseen.*\n**Fu (符):** *correspondence, harmony, or the alignment of forces.*\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is manifest and evident in the Great Principle (*Dàlǐ, 大理*), while the **Dao/Way** of humanity flows subtly and remains unrecognized. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor composed the *Yin Fu Jing* to illuminate the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and humanity, revealing the profound harmony of unseen forces with the Great Principle. Hence, it is called the *Yin Fu*.\n\nTo observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and grasp its operation is to comprehend it fully. Heaven moves above, Earth settles below, and the perfected sage (*shèngrén, 圣人*) takes his position between them. Yet, to attain the **Three Realms** (*sāncái, 三才*) is to share their inherent functions.\n\nBecause of this shared function, the *Yin Fu Jing* begins with: *To observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and grasp its operation is to comprehend it fully.* Observation means perceiving what is visible, while grasping means seizing what can be executed. Indeed, the *Yin Fu Jing*’s three hundred-plus **utterances** are all clear from beginning to end. The **Dao/Way** of Heaven, from its origin to its conclusion, embodies the principles of motion and stillness—when scholars grasp and act upon these, they attain the utmost subtleties of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is unseen when not observed, and the **Dao/Way** of humanity is unknown when not examined. Therefore, the **Dao/Way** of humanity and Heaven share a single root: the **primordial qi** (*yīqì, 一炁*). Their hidden harmony lies in the principle of cultivation, found in searching the text to uncover its fundamental essence.\n\nTo probe the minute and extract the marvelous, to seek the true and dispel the false, to rely upon the **Sacred Brightness** (*rìyuè, 日月*) for success—this is the path to becoming a **Divine Person** (*shénrén, 神人*), achieved through the mastery of subtle and profound principles. The subtle merges with the **Dao/Way**, while the marvelous aligns with the **Divine** (*shén, 神*).\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *In its unity, it aligns with Heaven; in its non-unity, it aligns with humanity.* Thus, one knows that Heaven’s law and my law differ not; how then does my **Dao/Way** differ from Heaven’s **Dao/Way**? It must not be overlooked.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves** (*wǔzéi, 五贼*), and those who perceive them flourish. The **Five Thieves** dwell within the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations. The cosmos lies within the grasp of one’s hands, and all transformations arise from the body. Heaven’s **Dao/Way** inherently lacks the **Five Thieves**—yet humanity’s heart remains unaware. The **Five Phases** (*wǔxíng, 五行*) possess the **qi** of inversion and compliance, akin to the **Thieves**’ plunder. The key lies in cultivating the heart: when the **Five Thieves** are turned to my use, they become my own.\n\nThus, Heaven’s creation and destruction, its nurturing and transformation of all things, all depend upon the **Five Phases**’ operations. The **Five Phases** arise from the **qi** of yin and yang dispersing into the **Five Stars** (*wǔxīng, 五星*), and the **Five Stars**’ **qi** disperses into the **Five Phases**. The **Five Phases**’ **qi** disperses into all things, and all things’ **qi** coalesces into the **Five Flavors** (*wǔwèi, 五味*). The **Five Flavors**’ **qi** refines into the **True Unity** (*zhēnyī, 真一*), which then scatters into the **Five Sprouts** (*wǔyá, 五芽*). The **Five Sprouts** grow into the **Five Roots** (*wǔgēn, 五根*), and the **Five Roots** manifest as the **Five Phases**, which then complete the **Five Organs** (*wǔzàng, 五脏*). Hence, humanity possesses the **Five Organs**, mirroring Heaven and Earth’s embrace of the **Five Phases**.\n\nThus, Heaven’s **Five Phases**’ **qi** enters the human abdomen, and the **Five Organs** suffer daily depletion, their vitality waning monthly. How much more so when the life-force (*xìngmìng, 性命*) shifts with the seasons and the body’s form is consumed by cold and heat? If one organ is damaged, disease arises; if all five organs wither, where then is the life-force? By this observation, one knows that the **Five Stars** in Heaven either follow or invert their course, bringing creation or destruction to humanity—those who perceive this flourish.\n\nThe adept perceives that humanity is born from the **Five Phases**, the **Five Grains** (*wǔgǔ, 五谷*), and the **Five Flavors**, and dies from them as well. Thus, the **qi** of the **Five Grains** is Heaven’s **colliding qi** (*chōngqì, 冲炁*) and Earth’s **soil essence** (*tǔyè, 土液*). If I eat them at the proper times, I can reclaim their stolen essence, aligning with their natural transformations—nourishing the **Mingmen** (*nǐhuán, 泥丸*) above and replenishing the marrow below.\n\nIf the world’s people understood how to return to the **Primordial Essence** (*yuán, 元*) and integrate it with their life-force, they would face no fear of the **Five Phases** overcoming one another, and their **Five Organs** would naturally be immortal. Even if the **Five Thieves** operated in Heaven, I would grasp them in my heart, store them in my application, and turn them to my advantage. Then, though the cosmos may be vast, it lies entirely within my grasp; though all transformations are broad, they are all within my **Dao/Way** and my body.\n\nHeaven’s nature is humanity. Humanity’s heart is the mechanism. Establishing Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is to stabilize humanity. Exhausting humanity is to align with Heaven; aligning with Heaven is to conform with the **Dao/Way**, which then unites with it in pure oneness without admixture.\n\nWhen humanity is born with depth, it is **nature** (*xìng, 性*). Restoring its **nature** is to dwell in that depth. Thus, one knows Heaven possesses **nature**, and **nature** permeates humanity; humanity has a heart, and the mechanism of the heart mirrors Heaven’s. Therefore, humanity embraces its **Spirit** (*líng, 灵*), its foundation being the **Dao/Way** of Heaven. Heart and **nature** harmonize, and the mechanism’s function aligns with the **Sacred Correspondence** (*fú, 符*), all rooted in the **Unity**.\n\nFrom this, one establishes Heaven’s **Dao/Way** to stabilize humanity. Moreover, the **Dao/Way** is a unified whole, and **nature** blends into the **True Unity** (*yīzhēn, 一真*), the origin of Heaven and Earth, and also the **Primordial Essence** of the **Three Realms**.\n\nHeaven attains **Unity** and becomes clear, Earth attains **Unity** and becomes tranquil, and humanity attains **Unity** and becomes **Spirit** (*líng, 灵*). Thus, one knows Heaven’s **nature** is shared with humanity, and humanity’s **nature** is shared with Heaven. The mechanism arises from a single heart, and one knows humanity’s heart mirrors Heaven’s while Heaven’s heart mirrors humanity’s. When heart and **nature** are in harmony, then one’s movements align with Heaven’s mechanism, and one’s heart aligns with Heaven’s mechanism—thus, one knows Heaven conceals its mechanisms within the **Primordial Chaos** (*hùndùn, 混沌*), and that the **Primordial Chaos** contains Heaven’s mechanisms.\n\nHeaven’s mechanism is Heaven’s heart. The profound mechanisms within the **Primordial Chaos** are humanity’s heart. When one uses the heart to emulate the heart, they can harmonize with the **Dao/Way**—Heaven’s mechanism and my heart are one, and my **nature** merges with Heaven’s mechanism. Therefore, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and humanity share a single root and source; thus, Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another.\n\nThe **scripture** says: *Establish Heaven’s **Dao/Way** to stabilize humanity*—this is it.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes its destructive mechanism, dragons and serpents emerge from the land. When humanity unleashes its destructive mechanism, Heaven and Earth invert and reverse. When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash their mechanisms, all transformations rest upon a fixed foundation. Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is pure yang, employing yin as its destructive mechanism; humanity’s **Dao/Way** dwells between yin and yang, employing yang as its destructive mechanism.\n\nThus, spring generates and autumn destroys—this is the **Primordial Patterns** (*lián, 乾坤*) sowing the **Dao/Way**’s great winds. When yang **qi** revives, all things gradually grow; when yin **qi** surges, all things gradually thrive. Dragons and serpents are creatures of yin with **nature** within them, riding the **Five Months**’ **Gua** (*xù, 姤卦*)—where one yin begins to generate—**qi**, then rushing forth from the land. This is when Heaven’s **Dao/Way** reveals its solemn and destructive mechanism, marking its commencement.\n\n「The **Dao/Way** of humanity seeks life, for pure yang is **immortality** (*xiān, 仙*), and pure yin becomes a **ghost** (*guǐ, 鬼*). One skilled in nurturing life can **steal Heaven’s mechanisms** (*tiān jī, 天机*), riding the **Eleventh Month’s Return Gua** (*fù guà, 复卦*)—where one yang begins to revive—**qi**, to stir the destructive mechanism, temper the yin dregs (*yīn zhì, 阴滓*), and dispel the **corporeal specter** (*shī pò, 尸魄*). Thus, when it is said that \"Heaven and Earth reverse and repeat,\" it means that while Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and humanity’s **Dao/Way** differ in their use of yin and yang, their principles of unleashing mechanisms align as one.\n\nTo know that Heaven’s **Dao/Way** unleashes its mechanism at the onset of returning yin to establish the foundation of all transformations, and to know that humanity’s **Dao/Way** unleashes its mechanism at the beginning of returning yang to establish the foundation of all transformations—that is the principle of Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and humanity’s **Dao/Way** jointly unleashing their mechanisms.\n\n**Nature** (*xìng, 性*) has skill and clumsiness, which can be **concealed** (*fú cáng, 伏藏*). Skill reveals itself in the heart, clumsiness obscures **nature**—this is the worldly application of skill and clumsiness. Thus, the **nature** of the **Sage** (*shèng rén, 圣人*) does not display its mechanisms through skill, nor does clumsiness obscure its **nature**, yet it does not indulge in activities contrary to the **Dao/Way**, moving in harmony with Heaven’s mechanisms, and all is concealed without fail.\n\nTherefore, Heaven’s **Dao/Way** endures without the application of skill or clumsiness, for it abides by its unchanging **nature**, ever preserving **emptiness and stillness** (*xū jì, 虚寂*). It aligns with the **Dao/Way** of **Nature** (*zìrán, 自然*), where all things lie dormant yet transform spontaneously. Hence, Heaven has great beauty yet does not speak, for it lacks the application of skill or clumsiness.\n\nFrom ancient times, the **High True Ones** (*gāo zhēn, 高真*) concealed their **nature** in accordance with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, taking from **Nature**’s spontaneity, relying solely on the **Sage**’s ability to **transform through the Dao/Way** (*dào huà, 道化*) without employing their own cleverness. They merely **conceal their traces** (*tāo jì, 韬迹*) and **hide their wisdom** (*yǐn zhì, 隐智*) to remain secret externally, while **clearing their hearts** (*chéng xīn, 澄心*) and **sealing their emotions** (*fēng qíng, 封情*) to remain steadfast internally. The *Dao De Jing* (*《道德经》*) states: \"I make the people’s minds dull, so they can be easily governed. Pure and simple, they are pure and simple.\" Confucius said: \"I spent a whole day talking with Hui, and he never contradicted me. It was as if I were a fool.\" Pure and simple!\n\nWhen Heaven’s mechanisms are not revealed, yet one silently harmonizes with the **Dao/Way**, this is called **Great Wisdom** (*dà zhì, 大智*). A scholar who comprehends **Great Wisdom** and aligns with Heaven’s **virtue/power** (*dé, 德*) can rely on **Dao/Way**’s transformation, and who would dare to employ their **nature** of skill and clumsiness? Thus, the **Sage** holds onto the **One** (*yī, 一*) to preserve it, not letting it stray, knowing that the **nature** of concealment aligns with the **Dao/Way** of **Nature**.\n\nAlas, the **nature** of ordinary people and their clever hearts merely roam externally, causing what affliction? What ordinary people do not know to cause affliction? What they cannot see is that they lose their **nature** and **leak their spirit** (*shī, 神*), indulge their hearts and **drift their will** (*dàng, 荡*), failing to grasp the principle of concealment. The *Classic* says: \"Great skill appears as clumsiness.\" This is when skill comes from **nature**, yet clumsiness is cultivated in the act of guarding.\n\nThe **Nine Orifices** (*jiǔ qiào, 九窍*)’s afflictions lie in the **Three Essentials** (*sān yào, 三要*), which can be controlled through **calm and movement** (*dòng jìng, 动静*). When one is enticed by external things, the heart finds delight within. Through the **orifices of hearing, sight, mouth, and nose** (*tīng shì kǒu bí, 听视口鼻*), the **spirit** (*shénmíng, 神明*) emerges. Guard your inner self, seal your outer self, do not take delight in communicating with things, and do not let them lure you—then you will find joy in Heaven and be content, who would toil endlessly with things as their concern?\n\nThus, the **Nine Orifices** receiving afflictions stems from the **Three Essentials**—the heart-**nature**’s movement and stillness, and the interplay of **evil and righteousness** (*xié zhèng, 邪正*). When the heart is not upright, **nature** reverts to **emotion** (*qíng, 情*), and **emotion** becomes its function. Hence, movement is called the heart, stillness is called **nature**. When it moves, **nature** reverts to **emotion**, so all transformations are without constancy and cannot be still; when it is still, **emotion** reverts to **nature**, so my heart remains ever constant and cannot be moved. Thus, the heart and **nature** become intertwined, leading to the interplay of **evil and righteousness**.\n\nTherefore, a scholar must not ignore the **Three Essentials**: the heart is the **Essential** of movement and stillness, **emotion** is the **Essential** that disrupts **nature**, and **nature** is the **Essential** that finds joy in the **Dao/Way**. Knowing these **Three Essentials**, one will not lose their original **nature**, restoring it to its **Essential** state and dwelling in **thickness** (*chǔ hòu, 处厚*). Hence, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight cannot move the heart. If there is any movement, it arises from **Nature**, meaning one does not lose the constancy of their heart, nor can things lure it. When one can be still, they achieve steadfastness through guarding **modesty** (*lián, 廉*), and all transformations cannot confuse them. Thus, a scholar must observe the **Essentials** of movement and stillness.\n\nFire arises from wood, and when **calamity** (*huò, 祸*) is unleashed, it must be overcome. **Deceit** (*jiān, 奸*) arises within a state, and when **opportunity** (*shí, 时*) moves, it must collapse. Knowing this and refining oneself is called being a **Sage**. The **Enlightened One** (*dá shì, 达士*) grasps the mechanism and instructs future generations. Within this lies the **Dao/Way** of enriching a state and securing its people, taking this as principle.\n\nBecause humanity has a heart, and the heart’s fire is **deceit**-afflicted, it consumes and depletes **essence and qi** (*jīng zhì, 精炁*), likened to wood containing fire—when **calamity** is unleashed, it must be overcome. The key lies in refining and restraining **deceit**, then one can **communicate with the spirit** (*tōng shén, 通神*).\n\nThus, wood is a thing. Within yin lies yang, meaning wood conceals fire. When yin-wood is about to burn, the ashes and fire extinguished—how can it endure? Hence, the **Sage** establishes laws, likening the human body to a state: it contains the **Dao/Way**’s substance, and life and death are bound by it. The *Dao De Jing* states: \"My greatest **blessing** (*huàn, 患*) is that I have a body.\" Hence, the body is likened to a state: the chest and abdomen are its chambers, the limbs are its borders, the bones and joints are its officials, the **spirit** (*shén, 神*) is its ruler, blood is its ministers, and **qi** is its people. To secure the state, one must **cherish** (*lìn, 吝*) its **qi**; to preserve the body.\n\nThe **deceit** of a state lies in the **Nine Orifices** as the **gates of affliction** (*shòu xié zhī mén, 受邪之门*), and the **Three Worms** (*sān chóng, 三虫*)—symbolizing the **Six Desires** (*liù yù, 六欲*)—as **spectral ghosts** (*liù guǐ, 六鬼*), luring and enticing the heart, entangling the **Six Emotions** (*liù qíng, 六情*). This is the **deceit** of the body-state. Hence, the body is likened to a state, because the human body is also a reflection of things.\n\nWhen one is inwardly attuned to the **True One’s qi** (*zhēn yī zhī zhì, 真一之炁*), nourishing and sustaining the hundred limbs, they preserve their **nature** and life. If the heart’s fire is not restrained, the **True One’s qi** dissipates, the **corporeal specter** (*shī pò, 尸魄*) arises from **deceit**, and the **Heavenly allotted years** (*tiān nián, 天年*) are exhausted—this is the moment when **opportunity** moves and **calamity** collapses.\n\nThe key lies in restraining the heart’s fire, refining the yin dregs, preventing **unrisen calamities** (*wèi qǐ zhī huò, 未起之祸*), and treating **unseen illnesses** (*wèi bìng zhī jí, 未病之疾*), focusing on what has not yet occurred, allowing the **spirit** to naturally **settle** (*tián, 恬*), the heart to naturally **extinguish** (*huī, 灰*), **nature** to naturally **still** (*jìng, 静*), and **emotion** to naturally **subside** (*mǐ, 弭*). Is this not the method of knowing and refining to achieve a state of **wealth and peace** (*fù guó ān mín, 富国安民*)?」\n\nThe **Heaven’s creation and destruction** are the **Dao/Way’s** natural principle. The **Heaven and Earth** are the **thieves** of all things; all things are the **thieves** of humanity; humanity is the **thief** of all things. When these three **thieves** operate harmoniously, the **Three Powers** (*sān cái, 三才*) are at peace.\n\nAll people are inevitably seduced by the things of the world, **stealing** their **nature and life** (*xìng mìng, 性命*). The key lies in learning to **return** the **thieves** of the world’s **essence**, replenishing and filling what is consumed and wasted to uphold the **constant Dao/Way**, thus attaining **full virtue/power** and allowing the **spirit** to naturally **settle** (*tián, 恬*).\n\nHence, the **True One’s qi** (*yuán qì, 元炁*) contains **spirit** within the **chaotic undifferentiated** (*hún dùn, 混沌*), for the **Three Powers** all share the same origin. When the **Dao/Way’s qi** disperses, the **Three Powers** separate and each **essence-qi** remains distinct. The **Heavenly yang** (*tiān yáng, 天阳*) is yang, the **Earthly yin** (*dì yīn, 地阴*) is yin. When yin returns to yang, all things are born; when yang returns to yin, all things perish—this is the **Dao/Way’s** principle of **Heaven’s creation and destruction**.\n\nThe **Heaven and Earth** apply their **transformative work** (*shī gōng, 施工*) to all things, ceaselessly, sometimes gathering, sometimes scattering—this is how things lack fixed form while the **Dao/Way** abides in **non-duality** (*bù èr, 不二*). The *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Things have no fixed form nor destruction; they return and merge into one\"*—thus knowing that **Heaven and Earth** **steal** through the **returning mechanism** of yin and yang.\n\nMoreover, among all things, humanity is the most **spiritually refined** (*líng, 灵*). Only humanity, along with **Heaven and Earth**, constitutes the **Three Powers**, rooted in the **True One’s qi**, sharing **virtue/power** with **Heaven**, and is also a **thief** of all things. For all things, born together with humanity to fulfill human desires, **steal** humanity’s **nature and emotions** (*xìng qíng, 性情*), and are thus also **thieves** of humanity.\n\nThus, one knows that humanity **steals** from all things to sustain life, all things **steal** from humanity to align with death, and **Heaven and Earth** **steal** from all things to return to their **root**. When these three **thieves** operate harmoniously, the **Three Powers** are at peace, and nothing is lost of the **wondrous essence** of **creation and transformation**.\n\nTo eat in accordance with the **times**, the **hundreds of limbs** (*bǎi huái, 百骸*) are in order. To move in accordance with **nature’s mechanism**, all transformations are at peace. When one learns to **steal** the **essence** of things to nourish their own **qi**, the key lies in eating without missing the **times**, thus aligning with **creation and transformation’s** mechanism.\n\nTherefore, **food** is the **essence** of the **five grains** (*wǔ gǔ, 五谷*), and it is called **essence** because it is the **Heavenly penetrating qi** (*tiān chōng qì, 天冲炁*) and the **Earthly soil-fluid** (*dì tǔ yè, 地土液*). When eaten at the right **times**, it nourishes the **five viscera** (*wǔ zàng, 五脏*), disperses through the **hundreds of limbs**, moistens the **skin and flesh**, and thus does not fail the **beginning and end** of **creation and transformation**.\n\nHence, following the **qi** of the **sun and moon**, it transforms into the **True One’s genuine water** (*tài yǐ zhēn shuǐ, 太乙真水*), ascending to the **spiritual source** (*líng yuán, 灵源*). The key lies in **nourishment**.\n\nThe **spiritual water** (*shén shuǐ, 神水*) beneath the tongue flows into the **lungs** and becomes **saliva** (*tuò, 唾*), whose white color symbolizes **gold**—**heart-fire** comes to subdue it; it flows into the **heart** and becomes **blood**, whose red color symbolizes **fire**—**kidney-water** comes to subdue it; it flows into the **kidneys** and becomes **essence** (*jīng, 精*), which is **water**—**spleen-soil** comes to subdue it. Returning upward to the **cauldron** (*dìng, 鼎*), its color is yellow, called the **yellow sprout** (*huáng yá, 黄芽*). Then it flows back into the **crucible** (*níng, 炁*) and is refined into **white snow** (*bái xuě, 白雪*) and **green gold** (*qīng jīn, 青金*); it ascends to the **heart**, purifying **heart-blood**; it flows into the **sea of qi** (*qì hǎi, 炁海*), dispersing and replenishing the **bone marrow**.\n\nThus, one knows that when **water** is abundant, **soil** is plentiful; when **soil** is plentiful, **blood** is strong; when **blood** is strong, **essence** overflows; when **essence** overflows, the **brain** is full—this is the principle of **returning essence to nourish the brain**, and the key lies in eating at the right **times**.\n\nHumans know their **spirit** and thus **spirit** exists; they do not know the **source of non-spirit** that makes **spirit** possible. The **most profound and formless** is **spirit**; the **unification with nature’s body** is **nature**; the **response to stimuli and interaction with things** is **emotion**—thus **spirit** and **nature** are inherently one, while **emotion** and **nature** divide into two functions.\n\nThose who only know **emotion’s** function often serve **spirit** elsewhere, unaware that I possess the ability to **spirit** and thus **spirit**. Those who know **nature** extends to the **profound and formless** understand that **spirit’s** function lies within me, and not in relying on another’s **spirit**.\n\nThus, the **learner of the Dao/Way**, seeking to **attain full spirit and virtue/power** and **reach nature and life**, must not fail to know the **source of nature and life**. For **life** is the **root of nature**, while **nature** is its **foundation**; **essence** is the **mother of spirit**, while **spirit** is its **offspring**. When **essence** is complete, **spirit** reigns; when **nature** is fully realized, one attains **life**.\n\nHence, when the **spirit settles** (*tián, 恬*), **nature stills** (*jìng, 静*); when **nature stills**, the **heart is harmonious** (*hé, 和*); when the **heart is harmonious**, the **pure and simple Dao/Way** can be upheld, and one does not lose unity with **spirit**.\n\nThe one who can **unify with spirit** ensures that **essence** does not depart from humanity while **spirit** does not depart from **qi**. When **spirit** and **qi** merge, the **form** is complete, and its function extends to **non-duality**—thus knowing that **non-spirit’s spirit** lies within me, not in another.\n\nThe **sun and moon** have their **fixed cycles**; the **great and small** have their **defined portions**. **Sagehood’s** work arises from this, and **spiritual clarity** emerges from it. The **sun** is yang; the **moon** is yin. **Yin and yang** are the **Dao/Way’s** functions. Thus, the **Dao/Way’s** functions operate through **nature**, ensuring the **sun and moon** have their **constant cycles** and the **great and small** their **defined portions**.\n\nThe **great** cannot surpass **Heaven and Earth**; the **small** does not exceed **humanity and things**. Though **humanity and things** are small, consider that among all things, humanity possesses its **spirit**, and its **nature** aligns with **Heaven’s**. Its **mechanisms** and **functions** are the same as the **One**—the small can emulate the **great Dao/Way’s** form, and **sagehood’s** work arises while **spiritual clarity** emerges.\n\nFurthermore, humanity’s birth receives **essence** from **Heaven’s One** to become the **source of wisdom**; **spirit** is obtained from **Heaven’s Five** to become the **root of nature**. When one attains this, they can **enter spirit** and **return to life**—thus knowing that though humanity’s **portion** is small, it can emulate **Heaven and Earth’s** greatness, and **sagehood’s** work arises, reaching the **sun and moon’s** cycles while **spiritual clarity** emerges.\n\nThe **classic** says: *\"Learning begins with becoming a scholar, and ends with becoming a sage.\"* For those who **learn the Dao/Way**, the **sun and moon’s** cycles must be known, and the **defined portions** of the **great and small** must be observed.\n\nMoreover, the **Dao/Way of Heaven** moves **three hundred sixty-five degrees** in one day and night, carrying the **sun and moon** along. The **sun’s** movement is slow, advancing **one degree** per day and night; the **moon’s** movement is swift, advancing **twelve degrees** per day and night. The **sun** completes a **full cycle** in one year; the **moon** completes a **full cycle** in one month. There are **twelve hours** in a day: six hours of yang, six hours of yin.\n\n**Heaven descends** and **Earth ascends**, merging once a day. Every **five days** symbolizes the **True One’s qi**; a month has **three hundred sixty times**, symbolizing the **fire’s** daily **alchemical process** in a year. The **moon** completes a **cycle** every **ten days**, merging on the **fifteenth** and exchanging on the **thirtieth**. At the **end of the month**, it **hides**; on the **first day**, it **rebirths**, perpetually cycling through **day and night**.\n\n「When the **Dao/Way**'s **virtue/power** is established, all things come to life; when the **divine brilliance** emerges, all things transform. Thus, the **sage** takes this as their standard, refining within a month to **usurp Heaven and Earth’s annual alchemical process** and establish the **Dao/Way**'s **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **sutra** states: *\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub.\"* Thus one knows that a month contains **three decads** (三旬). The first and last decads are times of **martial fire** (武火), while the middle decad, when the moon is at its fullest and brightest, is the time of **gentle fire** (文火). The **sutra** also says: *\"Martial fire at the beginning and end, gentle fire in the middle—this is the principle.\"*\n\nAgain it is said: *\"When the medicine is ready, the moon must be consulted as teacher.\"* And again: *\"Ascend beyond the sun and moon—I have attained the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\"* Therefore, the **Supreme Daoist Immortal** aligns with Heaven’s **fullness and emptiness**, entrusting themselves to the moon’s **fixed cycles**, emulating the great with the small, harmonizing with the **Great Principle** (大理) to comprehend that the Dao/Way transcends distinctions of small and great—this is clear.\n\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The sage aligns with the One of Heaven, while the common person aligns with the One of others.\"* This means that the **fixed distinctions** of great and small refer only to the **alignment of Heaven and humanity with the One**—its **subtle mechanisms** are visible to all yet understood by none.\n\nThe **virtuous** who grasp it preserve themselves, while the **petty** who grasp it risk their lives. The **Yellow Emperor** heard from the **Royal Person** (皇人) that **\"seeking life through the Dao/Way** must follow what gives birth to it,\"—this is the **Dao/Way’s subtle mechanism** in speech. The **enlightened adept** (達士) speaks of **\"martial arts to conquer and triumph over armies,\"**—the principle lies here.\n\nIf one can grasp the **mechanism**, it depends on preserving oneself; one must not indulge emotions and desires lightly, lest they **transgress the vital breath** and **deplete their life**.\n\n*Baopuzi* says: *\"Those skilled in the art can reverse the flow of life to replenish the brain.\"* Thus, what is **manifest in practice** yet **hidden in principle** is visible to all, yet none can truly comprehend it. The principle may be **plundered**, but the practice may be **discarded**—visible to all, yet none can truly grasp it.\n\nIf the principle can be **plundered**, it is because the Dao/Way alone can **seize it**; thus, the skilled in **plundering** may **force compliance**, but cannot **make known**—once known, the **cosmic vital breath** (冲炁) will not descend. The **mechanism’s** efficacy lies in its **secrecy**, yet all undertakings are accomplished through it. Only the **virtuous** can preserve themselves and **grasp the mechanism**.\n\nIf the **petty** see the principle and **plunder the mechanism**, they often fail to preserve themselves, and instead **suffer loss**,—this is **transgressing the vital breath** and **exhausting one’s fate**.\n\nThus, the **art of triumphing in battle** lies in **profound principles and deep mechanisms**; fearing the text’s complexity, I omit detailed exposition, but one may consult the *Taiyi Guoming Jindan Jingjue* to understand it fully.\n\nThe **blind** excel in hearing, the **deaf** excel in sight. **Cutting off one source of advantage**, one gains **tenfold** the teacher’s **virtue/power**; **three cycles of day and night**, one gains **ten thousandfold** the teacher’s **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **teacher** is a **model**; the **model** is the **standard**. Thus, the **standard** is the Dao/Way’s **constant**. Only the **standard** can **command the myriad transformations** and **stand independent above them**—this is **grasping the One Source’s standard** within the heart.\n\nThus, the **adepts of old** who grasped the **mechanism** instructed later generations, saying that **\"the **Supreme Dao/Way** of the Immortals and Divine Ones lies in embracing the One,\"**—the principle is here.\n\nSo the **blind**, unable to see, **specialize in hearing**; the **deaf**, unable to hear, **specialize in sight**. Both, through **focused vision and hearing**, surpass the ordinary by **tenfold** advantage—this is **grasping it in the heart**, learning from the **One Source’s standard**.\n\nThus, even the **deaf and blind**, though **sealed outside the Three Passes** (三关) and **isolated within**, can still gain **tenfold** advantage from the **One Source**. How much more so the **Daoist adept**, who **cycles through three returns of day and night**, **transcends ordinary vision and hearing**, **specializes in the One Source’s advantage**, and **learns from heart to heart**—will they not gain **ten thousandfold** advantage?\n\nThus, the **student** of the **Supreme Dao/Way** who embraces the **One** and preserves the **standard** must **return to the root** to **endure eternally**. **Returning to the root** is **restoring the original vital breath** (元炁).\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Harmonize with the One, and all undertakings are complete.\"* What is meant by **\"attaining the One is not to be divided,\" \"embracing the One is not to depart,\" \"preserving the One is not to stray\"**—only because **\"not being divided\"** allows one to **\"attain the One,\"** only because **\"not departing\"** allows one to **\"embrace the One,\"** only because **\"not straying\"** allows one to **\"preserve the One.\"**\n\nThus, the **method of preserving the One** depends on the heart **not wandering**; then the **nature** naturally **calms**, the **spirit** naturally **settles**, the **virtue/power** naturally **fulfills**, and the Dao/Way naturally **converges**.\n\nThe **Supreme Dao/Way** of the **Immortal and Divine Ones** began when the **Yellow Emperor** met the **Royal Person**, who asked: *\"Is there a **true One**’s divine **virtue/power** that can be heard?\"* The **Royal Person** was greatly startled and replied: *\"You are asking among the people—how could you hear this?\"* Then the **Yellow Emperor** ascended to the **Royal Master** (皇主) and recorded the first chapter, fearing the text’s complexity and unwilling to fully annotate it. One may instead consult the **Royal Person’s** *San Yi Tu Jing* (《三一图经》); upon reading it, the **details of embracing the One and preserving the Dao/Way** will be known.\n\nThe heart **is born from things** and **dies from things**; the **mechanism** lies in the eyes. When the **student** has practiced the **method of embracing the true and preserving the One**, if **disturbing thoughts** arise or the heart **fixes on things**, the key lies in **applying the eye’s mechanism** to **restrain those thoughts**.\n\nThe heart is the **master of the body** and the **commander of all spirits**; **exhaustion of the spirit** and **fatigue of thought** all stem from the heart. Thus, the heart has a **mechanism of action**—when confronted with things, it cannot avoid **perturbation**; when faced with intent, it cannot avoid **attachment**. Hence, the **heart’s eye** has **mutually dependent functions**, and **emotions and nature** have **mechanisms of selection and rejection**.\n\nWhen the heart **stirs from things**, it **dies to things** and **fixes on them**; once fixed, the **heart’s source** is no longer **One**, and the **spirit’s nature** becomes disordered—how could one gain **ten thousandfold** advantage?\n\nThus, the skilled in the Dao/Way, when the heart **fixes on things**, must **apply the eye’s mechanism**, **restraining the heart** so that all **defilements** are naturally **extinguished**.\n\nAt the moment of **extinguishing the heart**, one must **not perceive the heart’s fixation**, but rather **keep the eyes dimmed and fixedly gaze eastward**, like an **infant**—then the **spirit and vital breath** will not depart, and the heart will be **pure and clear**.\n\nAn **ancient poem** says:\n*\"Beard stained with blood, eyes like a ring—*\n*this is **applying the eye’s mechanism** to **extinguish the heart’s fixation**.\"*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: *\"Good at closing is like a gate with no bolt—*\n*yet it cannot be opened.\"* This is the **heart at rest** and **not fixed on things**.\n\nHeaven’s **virtue/power** is **without favor**, yet **great favor** arises. **Swift thunder** and **violent winds** all **act without hesitation**. The **greatness of its favor and awe** is none greater than that of **Heaven and Earth**; the **heart that receives its blessings** is none other than **humanity**’s.»\n\nThe **Heavenly Dao** bestows **harmonious surging qi** upon the world, **without interruption**. Its **lack of interruption** lies in its **great benevolence and boundless favor**, extending to all beings, **only welcoming those who delight in virtue**, enabling them to **penetrate truth and attain the Dao**, entering the **domain of the Sage**.\n\nThe **classic** states:\n*\"The **Celestial Sovereign has no favorites**—only the virtuous does it assist.\"*\nThis means the **Dao has no distinctions of near or far**, nor of good or bad—**only when a person aligns with the Dao does the Dao itself open the way for them**. **Only the perfected** can receive **Heaven’s great favor**, becoming **companions with Heaven**. Even if **Heaven’s Dao** unleashes **ominous, stern, and killing qi**, or **deploys the might of swift thunder and violent winds**, the perfected remain **unfazed and fearless**, for their **senses are closed to the external**, while their **mind and intention are sealed within**.\n\n**Supreme joy** leaves **nature unspent**; **supreme stillness** brings **clarity**. **Empty and tranquil**, unmixed with things—this is the **substance of the Dao**. The **ancients who embodied the Dao** took **inner cultivation** as their pursuit, not delighting in **external engagement**, but simply **rejoicing in their nature**.\n\nWhen a person **rejoices in their nature**, it is not by **deliberate intent**—**returning to the One leaves no trace**, simply following **its natural course**. Thus, **rejoicing in nature** leaves **nature unexhausted**; **remaining unmixed with things** ensures **stillness is untainted**. Therefore, **rejoicing in Heaven and knowing one’s fate** brings **no sorrow**; **nature’s serenity and simplicity** eliminate **greed**, so the **heart labors not**. When the **heart does not labor**, the **spirit does not leak**; when the **spirit does not leak**, the **emotions remain undisturbed**, and **nature attains supreme joy**.\n\n**Supreme joy** in nature **realizes supreme beauty** in **effortless play**, reaching **supreme stillness**—this is the **governance of clarity**. **Heaven’s utmost partiality** is **public in its application**. **Heaven’s Dao favors the virtuous**—this is its **partiality toward persons**; **applying the Dao with equanimity**—this is its **public justice**. Thus, **Heaven favors persons but not the Dao**; **applying the Dao is public but not partial to things**—this is **true public justice**. The **Celestial Sovereign has no favorites**, **aiding only through virtue**—this is **favoring persons while not favoring the Dao**.\n\nThe **nature of the world** is a **mingling of good and evil**; **near virtue, one becomes virtuous**; **near vice, one becomes vicious**—this is not **inherent nature**, but **habit shaping character**. Thus, for the **seeker of the Dao**, the key lies in **finding a wise teacher**, **nearing virtuous companions**, and **resolutely cultivating the will**, only then **entering the Sage’s gate**. **Heaven itself will not obstruct**; **responding to the numinous** depends on **cleansing the heart and mastering oneself**, **never abandoning the Dao-heart**—then **Heaven’s spirits will secretly aid**, and **the will must not falter**. If **seeking teachers and companions**, one finds the right ones—**then serve them**; if not, **press on steadfastly**, for **the body will be at ease**, and **the study of nature and life must not be neglected**.\n\n**Birds are governed by qi**. When **Heaven is empty**, qi **floats upward**; when qi **floats upward**, birds **use their feathers to govern qi**, flying and ascending. Thus, the **seeker must empty the heart and guard stillness**, **balance the qi and tranquilize the spirit**, so the **heart naturally aligns without deceit**, and **nature naturally stills without confusion**.\n\nThe **spirit is the child of qi**; **qi is the mother of the spirit**. When **spirit and qi unite**, the **true essence does not scatter**; the **spirit is at ease and the form is firm**—this is the work of qi.\n\nThe **human body** is a **manifestation of things**. If it **resembles things**, then **life and death are bound**, and **exhaustion comes with time**. The key lies in: **qi robust, spirit intact**; **qi decayed, spirit ruined**. The **classic** says: *\"Birds are governed by qi.\"* **Birds** means **to restrain**. **Restraint of the heart, governance of qi**.\n\nEven birds, **able to fly upward**, are like **human qi**—**filling the boundless void**, **supporting Heaven and Earth**, and **lifting the form to transcendence**. This is because **the heart is empty**, so **qi fills the great expanse**, **gathering with the Dao in emptiness**. *\"The empty chamber births white\"*—this is the ability to **nurture the One qi**, **governing it thus**.\n\nAs **Mencius** said:\n*\"I can nurture the **unbounded, noble qi**, filling the space between Heaven and Earth.\"*\nThis is **deeply attaining the way of governing qi**.\n\n**Life is the root of death**; **death is the root of life**. **Creation subtly shifts**; **yin and yang are unfathomable**. **Life arises from the spirit**; **death lies in the form**—this is the **unity of qi rooted in nature**. Thus, **life is the beginning of creation**; **death is the transformation of yin and yang**. **No two things flourish simultaneously**—this is yin and yang. Thus, **all things take form through yin and yang**, **transform through yin and yang**. The **classic** says: *\"Heaven gives life; Heaven takes life—this is the principle of the Dao.\"*\n\nThus, the **Great Dao** stems from **One qi**, **governing the movement of sun and moon**. **Sun and moon** are the **ancestors of yin and yang**, **mutually interacting**, **spreading qi to nurture life**. When **yang qi returns**, all things **are born**; when **yin qi completes**, all things **perish**. Thus, the **principle of life and death** originates in the **Dao-source**, **existing and vanishing like mist**.\n\nThe **human Dao** is also **bound to life and death**, **rooted in One qi**, **sensing the union of yin and yang from parents** to **be born**, and **dying when yin and yang’s measure is exhausted**. The key lies in **refining yin with yang**; when **yin dross is exhausted**, the **yang essence is perfected**, **One qi is complete**, and the **Dao flows naturally**—then **returning to the origin**, **reverting to the root**, and **restoring to the source** is achieved.\n\n**Favor arises from harm**; **harm arises from favor**. **Kindness as favor** brings **harm in its wake**. Thus, **favor and love mutually generate**—this is the **root of human emotional use**. **Seekers of the Dao** are often **entangled by favor and love**, **halting mid-path**, **abandoning halfway**, **beginning with diligence but ending in laziness**—is this not the **common plight of mortals**?\n\nThus, **self-inflicted harm** arises from **favor**, and **harm stems from favor**. The key lies in **knowing One qi permeates the numinous**; **ten thousand calamities will not intrude**; **a single body attaining the Dao**—**seven generations ascend to Heaven**. Those who **can resolutely advance on the Dao** will have **favor extend to themselves while harm does not**; the **unenlightened**, if they **do not eliminate the heart of favor and love**, will have **favor extend to others while harm befalls themselves**.\n\nThus, **the heart filled with favor and love** is the **delusion of the world**; **arousing emotions of honor and shame** is the **greed of the world**. Alas! **The harms of sorrow, toil, and injury**—why do they bring **joy to all under Heaven?**\n\nFrom this perspective, those who do not suffer harm are those whose favor and love run deep, for they are the hidden roots of calamity.\n\nYet those who truly walk the Dao are different. They take delight in the tranquil mind, honor emptiness, purify their hearts like washing in snow, and still their wills in silence—thus, favor does not extend to others, nor does harm befall themselves.\n\nThe foolish mistake the natural patterns of Heaven and Earth for sacred wisdom, while I see the profound order in the things of the moment. The daily necessities of life—those are the sacred elixirs nourishing the roots of the Dao.\n\nThus, people vary in virtue, and understanding runs deep or shallow. The wise possess keen insight, broad vision, and lofty resolve; the foolish are narrow in thought, low in perception, and speak with clumsy words.\n\nYet they fail to recognize that Heaven and Earth follow their natural laws, flowing eternally without change or deviation, their constancy unshaken. The foolish revere this as sacred, yet they do not perceive the profound order in the things of the moment that people use daily without knowing their true nature.\n\nThe Five Grains are the daily sustenance of all under Heaven. Yet the world seeks only to fill its belly, never probing the origins of transformation.\n\nIndeed, the Five Grains steal from Heaven and Earth’s creative force to grow, plundering the vital qi of yin and yang to ripen. Thus, one knows they are the true essence of Heaven and Earth’s unity. When they flourish and mature, humans consume them, absorbing their qi to prolong life. As they pass through the spleen and stomach, their essence transforms into the primordial true water of the Five Phases—this is the original source of the Five Elements. How could one not know that the essence and qi of the Five Grains are the sacred elixirs of Heaven and Earth, the radiant essence of the sun and moon, the refined marrow of the Five Phases? They nourish my life, enrich my qi, sustain my form, extend my years, preserve my spirit, and awaken my enlightenment.\n\nIs this not what I mean by calling the order of the things of the moment profound wisdom? —*Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* *Yin-Shang Jing*.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is manifest and evident in the Great Principle (*Dàlǐ, 大理*), while the **Dao/Way** of humanity flows subtly and remains unrecognized. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor composed the *Yin Fu Jing* to illuminate the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and humanity, revealing the profound harmony of unseen forces with the Great Principle. Hence, it is called the *Yin Fu*.\n\nTo observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and grasp its operation is to comprehend it fully. Heaven moves above, Earth settles below, and the perfected sage (*shèngrén, 圣人*) takes his position between them. Yet, to attain the **Three Realms** (*sāncái, 三才*) is to share their inherent functions.\n\nBecause of this shared function, the *Yin Fu Jing* begins with: *To observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and grasp its operation is to comprehend it fully.* Observation means perceiving what is visible, while grasping means seizing what can be executed. Indeed, the *Yin Fu Jing*’s three hundred-plus **utterances** are all clear from beginning to end. The **Dao/Way** of Heaven, from its origin to its conclusion, embodies the principles of motion and stillness—when scholars grasp and act upon these, they attain the utmost subtleties of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is unseen when not observed, and the **Dao/Way** of humanity is unknown when not examined. Therefore, the **Dao/Way** of humanity and Heaven share a single root: the **primordial qi** (*yīqì, 一炁*). Their hidden harmony lies in the principle of cultivation, found in searching the text to uncover its fundamental essence.\n\nTo probe the minute and extract the marvelous, to seek the true and dispel the false, to rely upon the **Sacred Brightness** (*rìyuè, 日月*) for success—this is the path to becoming a **Divine Person** (*shénrén, 神人*), achieved through the mastery of subtle and profound principles. The subtle merges with the **Dao/Way**, while the marvelous aligns with the **Divine** (*shén, 神*).\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *In its unity, it aligns with Heaven; in its non-unity, it aligns with humanity.* Thus, one knows that Heaven’s law and my law differ not; how then does my **Dao/Way** differ from Heaven’s **Dao/Way**? It must not be overlooked.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves** (*wǔzéi, 五贼*), and those who perceive them flourish. The **Five Thieves** dwell within the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations. The cosmos lies within the grasp of one’s hands, and all transformations arise from the body. Heaven’s **Dao/Way** inherently lacks the **Five Thieves**—yet humanity’s heart remains unaware. The **Five Phases** (*wǔxíng, 五行*) possess the **qi** of inversion and compliance, akin to the **Thieves**’ plunder. The key lies in cultivating the heart: when the **Five Thieves** are turned to my use, they become my own.\n\nThus, Heaven’s creation and destruction, its nurturing and transformation of all things, all depend upon the **Five Phases**’ operations. The **Five Phases** arise from the **qi** of yin and yang dispersing into the **Five Stars** (*wǔxīng, 五星*), and the **Five Stars**’ **qi** disperses into the **Five Phases**. The **Five Phases**’ **qi** disperses into all things, and all things’ **qi** coalesces into the **Five Flavors** (*wǔwèi, 五味*). The **Five Flavors**’ **qi** refines into the **True Unity** (*zhēnyī, 真一*), which then scatters into the **Five Sprouts** (*wǔyá, 五芽*). The **Five Sprouts** grow into the **Five Roots** (*wǔgēn, 五根*), and the **Five Roots** manifest as the **Five Phases**, which then complete the **Five Organs** (*wǔzàng, 五脏*). Hence, humanity possesses the **Five Organs**, mirroring Heaven and Earth’s embrace of the **Five Phases**.\n\nThus, Heaven’s **Five Phases**’ **qi** enters the human abdomen, and the **Five Organs** suffer daily depletion, their vitality waning monthly. How much more so when the life-force (*xìngmìng, 性命*) shifts with the seasons and the body’s form is consumed by cold and heat? If one organ is damaged, disease arises; if all five organs wither, where then is the life-force? By this observation, one knows that the **Five Stars** in Heaven either follow or invert their course, bringing creation or destruction to humanity—those who perceive this flourish.\n\nThe adept perceives that humanity is born from the **Five Phases**, the **Five Grains** (*wǔgǔ, 五谷*), and the **Five Flavors**, and dies from them as well. Thus, the **qi** of the **Five Grains** is Heaven’s **colliding qi** (*chōngqì, 冲炁*) and Earth’s **soil essence** (*tǔyè, 土液*). If I eat them at the proper times, I can reclaim their stolen essence, aligning with their natural transformations—nourishing the **Mingmen** (*nǐhuán, 泥丸*) above and replenishing the marrow below.\n\nIf the world’s people understood how to return to the **Primordial Essence** (*yuán, 元*) and integrate it with their life-force, they would face no fear of the **Five Phases** overcoming one another, and their **Five Organs** would naturally be immortal. Even if the **Five Thieves** operated in Heaven, I would grasp them in my heart, store them in my application, and turn them to my advantage. Then, though the cosmos may be vast, it lies entirely within my grasp; though all transformations are broad, they are all within my **Dao/Way** and my body.\n\nHeaven’s nature is humanity. Humanity’s heart is the mechanism. Establishing Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is to stabilize humanity. Exhausting humanity is to align with Heaven; aligning with Heaven is to conform with the **Dao/Way**, which then unites with it in pure oneness without admixture.\n\nWhen humanity is born with depth, it is **nature** (*xìng, 性*). Restoring its **nature** is to dwell in that depth. Thus, one knows Heaven possesses **nature**, and **nature** permeates humanity; humanity has a heart, and the mechanism of the heart mirrors Heaven’s. Therefore, humanity embraces its **Spirit** (*líng, 灵*), its foundation being the **Dao/Way** of Heaven. Heart and **nature** harmonize, and the mechanism’s function aligns with the **Sacred Correspondence** (*fú, 符*), all rooted in the **Unity**.\n\nFrom this, one establishes Heaven’s **Dao/Way** to stabilize humanity. Moreover, the **Dao/Way** is a unified whole, and **nature** blends into the **True Unity** (*yīzhēn, 一真*), the origin of Heaven and Earth, and also the **Primordial Essence** of the **Three Realms**.\n\nHeaven attains **Unity** and becomes clear, Earth attains **Unity** and becomes tranquil, and humanity attains **Unity** and becomes **Spirit** (*líng, 灵*). Thus, one knows Heaven’s **nature** is shared with humanity, and humanity’s **nature** is shared with Heaven. The mechanism arises from a single heart, and one knows humanity’s heart mirrors Heaven’s while Heaven’s heart mirrors humanity’s. When heart and **nature** are in harmony, then one’s movements align with Heaven’s mechanism, and one’s heart aligns with Heaven’s mechanism—thus, one knows Heaven conceals its mechanisms within the **Primordial Chaos** (*hùndùn, 混沌*), and that the **Primordial Chaos** contains Heaven’s mechanisms.\n\nHeaven’s mechanism is Heaven’s heart. The profound mechanisms within the **Primordial Chaos** are humanity’s heart. When one uses the heart to emulate the heart, they can harmonize with the **Dao/Way**—Heaven’s mechanism and my heart are one, and my **nature** merges with Heaven’s mechanism. Therefore, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and humanity share a single root and source; thus, Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another.\n\nThe **scripture** says: *Establish Heaven’s **Dao/Way** to stabilize humanity*—this is it.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes its destructive mechanism, dragons and serpents emerge from the land. When humanity unleashes its destructive mechanism, Heaven and Earth invert and reverse. When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash their mechanisms, all transformations rest upon a fixed foundation. Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is pure yang, employing yin as its destructive mechanism; humanity’s **Dao/Way** dwells between yin and yang, employing yang as its destructive mechanism.\n\nThus, spring generates and autumn destroys—this is the **Primordial Patterns** (*lián, 乾坤*) sowing the **Dao/Way**’s great winds. When yang **qi** revives, all things gradually grow; when yin **qi** surges, all things gradually thrive. Dragons and serpents are creatures of yin with **nature** within them, riding the **Five Months**’ **Gua** (*xù, 姤卦*)—where one yin begins to generate—**qi**, then rushing forth from the land. This is when Heaven’s **Dao/Way** reveals its solemn and destructive mechanism, marking its commencement.",

      "translated_text": "「The **Dao/Way** of humanity seeks life, for pure yang is **immortality** (*xiān, 仙*), and pure yin becomes a **ghost** (*guǐ, 鬼*). One skilled in nurturing life can **steal Heaven’s mechanisms** (*tiān jī, 天机*), riding the **Eleventh Month’s Return Gua** (*fù guà, 复卦*)—where one yang begins to revive—**qi**, to stir the destructive mechanism, temper the yin dregs (*yīn zhì, 阴滓*), and dispel the **corporeal specter** (*shī pò, 尸魄*). Thus, when it is said that \"Heaven and Earth reverse and repeat,\" it means that while Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and humanity’s **Dao/Way** differ in their use of yin and yang, their principles of unleashing mechanisms align as one.\n\nTo know that Heaven’s **Dao/Way** unleashes its mechanism at the onset of returning yin to establish the foundation of all transformations, and to know that humanity’s **Dao/Way** unleashes its mechanism at the beginning of returning yang to establish the foundation of all transformations—that is the principle of Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and humanity’s **Dao/Way** jointly unleashing their mechanisms.\n\n**Nature** (*xìng, 性*) has skill and clumsiness, which can be **concealed** (*fú cáng, 伏藏*). Skill reveals itself in the heart, clumsiness obscures **nature**—this is the worldly application of skill and clumsiness. Thus, the **nature** of the **Sage** (*shèng rén, 圣人*) does not display its mechanisms through skill, nor does clumsiness obscure its **nature**, yet it does not indulge in activities contrary to the **Dao/Way**, moving in harmony with Heaven’s mechanisms, and all is concealed without fail.\n\nTherefore, Heaven’s **Dao/Way** endures without the application of skill or clumsiness, for it abides by its unchanging **nature**, ever preserving **emptiness and stillness** (*xū jì, 虚寂*). It aligns with the **Dao/Way** of **Nature** (*zìrán, 自然*), where all things lie dormant yet transform spontaneously. Hence, Heaven has great beauty yet does not speak, for it lacks the application of skill or clumsiness.\n\nFrom ancient times, the **High True Ones** (*gāo zhēn, 高真*) concealed their **nature** in accordance with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, taking from **Nature**’s spontaneity, relying solely on the **Sage**’s ability to **transform through the Dao/Way** (*dào huà, 道化*) without employing their own cleverness. They merely **conceal their traces** (*tāo jì, 韬迹*) and **hide their wisdom** (*yǐn zhì, 隐智*) to remain secret externally, while **clearing their hearts** (*chéng xīn, 澄心*) and **sealing their emotions** (*fēng qíng, 封情*) to remain steadfast internally. The *Dao De Jing* (*《道德经》*) states: \"I make the people’s minds dull, so they can be easily governed. Pure and simple, they are pure and simple.\" Confucius said: \"I spent a whole day talking with Hui, and he never contradicted me. It was as if I were a fool.\" Pure and simple!\n\nWhen Heaven’s mechanisms are not revealed, yet one silently harmonizes with the **Dao/Way**, this is called **Great Wisdom** (*dà zhì, 大智*). A scholar who comprehends **Great Wisdom** and aligns with Heaven’s **virtue/power** (*dé, 德*) can rely on **Dao/Way**’s transformation, and who would dare to employ their **nature** of skill and clumsiness? Thus, the **Sage** holds onto the **One** (*yī, 一*) to preserve it, not letting it stray, knowing that the **nature** of concealment aligns with the **Dao/Way** of **Nature**.\n\nAlas, the **nature** of ordinary people and their clever hearts merely roam externally, causing what affliction? What ordinary people do not know to cause affliction? What they cannot see is that they lose their **nature** and **leak their spirit** (*shī, 神*), indulge their hearts and **drift their will** (*dàng, 荡*), failing to grasp the principle of concealment. The *Classic* says: \"Great skill appears as clumsiness.\" This is when skill comes from **nature**, yet clumsiness is cultivated in the act of guarding.\n\nThe **Nine Orifices** (*jiǔ qiào, 九窍*)’s afflictions lie in the **Three Essentials** (*sān yào, 三要*), which can be controlled through **calm and movement** (*dòng jìng, 动静*). When one is enticed by external things, the heart finds delight within. Through the **orifices of hearing, sight, mouth, and nose** (*tīng shì kǒu bí, 听视口鼻*), the **spirit** (*shénmíng, 神明*) emerges. Guard your inner self, seal your outer self, do not take delight in communicating with things, and do not let them lure you—then you will find joy in Heaven and be content, who would toil endlessly with things as their concern?\n\nThus, the **Nine Orifices** receiving afflictions stems from the **Three Essentials**—the heart-**nature**’s movement and stillness, and the interplay of **evil and righteousness** (*xié zhèng, 邪正*). When the heart is not upright, **nature** reverts to **emotion** (*qíng, 情*), and **emotion** becomes its function. Hence, movement is called the heart, stillness is called **nature**. When it moves, **nature** reverts to **emotion**, so all transformations are without constancy and cannot be still; when it is still, **emotion** reverts to **nature**, so my heart remains ever constant and cannot be moved. Thus, the heart and **nature** become intertwined, leading to the interplay of **evil and righteousness**.\n\nTherefore, a scholar must not ignore the **Three Essentials**: the heart is the **Essential** of movement and stillness, **emotion** is the **Essential** that disrupts **nature**, and **nature** is the **Essential** that finds joy in the **Dao/Way**. Knowing these **Three Essentials**, one will not lose their original **nature**, restoring it to its **Essential** state and dwelling in **thickness** (*chǔ hòu, 处厚*). Hence, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight cannot move the heart. If there is any movement, it arises from **Nature**, meaning one does not lose the constancy of their heart, nor can things lure it. When one can be still, they achieve steadfastness through guarding **modesty** (*lián, 廉*), and all transformations cannot confuse them. Thus, a scholar must observe the **Essentials** of movement and stillness.\n\nFire arises from wood, and when **calamity** (*huò, 祸*) is unleashed, it must be overcome. **Deceit** (*jiān, 奸*) arises within a state, and when **opportunity** (*shí, 时*) moves, it must collapse. Knowing this and refining oneself is called being a **Sage**. The **Enlightened One** (*dá shì, 达士*) grasps the mechanism and instructs future generations. Within this lies the **Dao/Way** of enriching a state and securing its people, taking this as principle.\n\nBecause humanity has a heart, and the heart’s fire is **deceit**-afflicted, it consumes and depletes **essence and qi** (*jīng zhì, 精炁*), likened to wood containing fire—when **calamity** is unleashed, it must be overcome. The key lies in refining and restraining **deceit**, then one can **communicate with the spirit** (*tōng shén, 通神*).\n\nThus, wood is a thing. Within yin lies yang, meaning wood conceals fire. When yin-wood is about to burn, the ashes and fire extinguished—how can it endure? Hence, the **Sage** establishes laws, likening the human body to a state: it contains the **Dao/Way**’s substance, and life and death are bound by it. The *Dao De Jing* states: \"My greatest **blessing** (*huàn, 患*) is that I have a body.\" Hence, the body is likened to a state: the chest and abdomen are its chambers, the limbs are its borders, the bones and joints are its officials, the **spirit** (*shén, 神*) is its ruler, blood is its ministers, and **qi** is its people. To secure the state, one must **cherish** (*lìn, 吝*) its **qi**; to preserve the body.\n\nThe **deceit** of a state lies in the **Nine Orifices** as the **gates of affliction** (*shòu xié zhī mén, 受邪之门*), and the **Three Worms** (*sān chóng, 三虫*)—symbolizing the **Six Desires** (*liù yù, 六欲*)—as **spectral ghosts** (*liù guǐ, 六鬼*), luring and enticing the heart, entangling the **Six Emotions** (*liù qíng, 六情*). This is the **deceit** of the body-state. Hence, the body is likened to a state, because the human body is also a reflection of things.\n\nWhen one is inwardly attuned to the **True One’s qi** (*zhēn yī zhī zhì, 真一之炁*), nourishing and sustaining the hundred limbs, they preserve their **nature** and life. If the heart’s fire is not restrained, the **True One’s qi** dissipates, the **corporeal specter** (*shī pò, 尸魄*) arises from **deceit**, and the **Heavenly allotted years** (*tiān nián, 天年*) are exhausted—this is the moment when **opportunity** moves and **calamity** collapses.\n\nThe key lies in restraining the heart’s fire, refining the yin dregs, preventing **unrisen calamities** (*wèi qǐ zhī huò, 未起之祸*), and treating **unseen illnesses** (*wèi bìng zhī jí, 未病之疾*), focusing on what has not yet occurred, allowing the **spirit** to naturally **settle** (*tián, 恬*), the heart to naturally **extinguish** (*huī, 灰*), **nature** to naturally **still** (*jìng, 静*), and **emotion** to naturally **subside** (*mǐ, 弭*). Is this not the method of knowing and refining to achieve a state of **wealth and peace** (*fù guó ān mín, 富国安民*)?」",

      "translated_text": "The **Heaven’s creation and destruction** are the **Dao/Way’s** natural principle. The **Heaven and Earth** are the **thieves** of all things; all things are the **thieves** of humanity; humanity is the **thief** of all things. When these three **thieves** operate harmoniously, the **Three Powers** (*sān cái, 三才*) are at peace.\n\nAll people are inevitably seduced by the things of the world, **stealing** their **nature and life** (*xìng mìng, 性命*). The key lies in learning to **return** the **thieves** of the world’s **essence**, replenishing and filling what is consumed and wasted to uphold the **constant Dao/Way**, thus attaining **full virtue/power** and allowing the **spirit** to naturally **settle** (*tián, 恬*).\n\nHence, the **True One’s qi** (*yuán qì, 元炁*) contains **spirit** within the **chaotic undifferentiated** (*hún dùn, 混沌*), for the **Three Powers** all share the same origin. When the **Dao/Way’s qi** disperses, the **Three Powers** separate and each **essence-qi** remains distinct. The **Heavenly yang** (*tiān yáng, 天阳*) is yang, the **Earthly yin** (*dì yīn, 地阴*) is yin. When yin returns to yang, all things are born; when yang returns to yin, all things perish—this is the **Dao/Way’s** principle of **Heaven’s creation and destruction**.\n\nThe **Heaven and Earth** apply their **transformative work** (*shī gōng, 施工*) to all things, ceaselessly, sometimes gathering, sometimes scattering—this is how things lack fixed form while the **Dao/Way** abides in **non-duality** (*bù èr, 不二*). The *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Things have no fixed form nor destruction; they return and merge into one\"*—thus knowing that **Heaven and Earth** **steal** through the **returning mechanism** of yin and yang.\n\nMoreover, among all things, humanity is the most **spiritually refined** (*líng, 灵*). Only humanity, along with **Heaven and Earth**, constitutes the **Three Powers**, rooted in the **True One’s qi**, sharing **virtue/power** with **Heaven**, and is also a **thief** of all things. For all things, born together with humanity to fulfill human desires, **steal** humanity’s **nature and emotions** (*xìng qíng, 性情*), and are thus also **thieves** of humanity.\n\nThus, one knows that humanity **steals** from all things to sustain life, all things **steal** from humanity to align with death, and **Heaven and Earth** **steal** from all things to return to their **root**. When these three **thieves** operate harmoniously, the **Three Powers** are at peace, and nothing is lost of the **wondrous essence** of **creation and transformation**.\n\nTo eat in accordance with the **times**, the **hundreds of limbs** (*bǎi huái, 百骸*) are in order. To move in accordance with **nature’s mechanism**, all transformations are at peace. When one learns to **steal** the **essence** of things to nourish their own **qi**, the key lies in eating without missing the **times**, thus aligning with **creation and transformation’s** mechanism.\n\nTherefore, **food** is the **essence** of the **five grains** (*wǔ gǔ, 五谷*), and it is called **essence** because it is the **Heavenly penetrating qi** (*tiān chōng qì, 天冲炁*) and the **Earthly soil-fluid** (*dì tǔ yè, 地土液*). When eaten at the right **times**, it nourishes the **five viscera** (*wǔ zàng, 五脏*), disperses through the **hundreds of limbs**, moistens the **skin and flesh**, and thus does not fail the **beginning and end** of **creation and transformation**.\n\nHence, following the **qi** of the **sun and moon**, it transforms into the **True One’s genuine water** (*tài yǐ zhēn shuǐ, 太乙真水*), ascending to the **spiritual source** (*líng yuán, 灵源*). The key lies in **nourishment**.\n\nThe **spiritual water** (*shén shuǐ, 神水*) beneath the tongue flows into the **lungs** and becomes **saliva** (*tuò, 唾*), whose white color symbolizes **gold**—**heart-fire** comes to subdue it; it flows into the **heart** and becomes **blood**, whose red color symbolizes **fire**—**kidney-water** comes to subdue it; it flows into the **kidneys** and becomes **essence** (*jīng, 精*), which is **water**—**spleen-soil** comes to subdue it. Returning upward to the **cauldron** (*dìng, 鼎*), its color is yellow, called the **yellow sprout** (*huáng yá, 黄芽*). Then it flows back into the **crucible** (*níng, 炁*) and is refined into **white snow** (*bái xuě, 白雪*) and **green gold** (*qīng jīn, 青金*); it ascends to the **heart**, purifying **heart-blood**; it flows into the **sea of qi** (*qì hǎi, 炁海*), dispersing and replenishing the **bone marrow**.\n\nThus, one knows that when **water** is abundant, **soil** is plentiful; when **soil** is plentiful, **blood** is strong; when **blood** is strong, **essence** overflows; when **essence** overflows, the **brain** is full—this is the principle of **returning essence to nourish the brain**, and the key lies in eating at the right **times**.\n\nHumans know their **spirit** and thus **spirit** exists; they do not know the **source of non-spirit** that makes **spirit** possible. The **most profound and formless** is **spirit**; the **unification with nature’s body** is **nature**; the **response to stimuli and interaction with things** is **emotion**—thus **spirit** and **nature** are inherently one, while **emotion** and **nature** divide into two functions.\n\nThose who only know **emotion’s** function often serve **spirit** elsewhere, unaware that I possess the ability to **spirit** and thus **spirit**. Those who know **nature** extends to the **profound and formless** understand that **spirit’s** function lies within me, and not in relying on another’s **spirit**.\n\nThus, the **learner of the Dao/Way**, seeking to **attain full spirit and virtue/power** and **reach nature and life**, must not fail to know the **source of nature and life**. For **life** is the **root of nature**, while **nature** is its **foundation**; **essence** is the **mother of spirit**, while **spirit** is its **offspring**. When **essence** is complete, **spirit** reigns; when **nature** is fully realized, one attains **life**.\n\nHence, when the **spirit settles** (*tián, 恬*), **nature stills** (*jìng, 静*); when **nature stills**, the **heart is harmonious** (*hé, 和*); when the **heart is harmonious**, the **pure and simple Dao/Way** can be upheld, and one does not lose unity with **spirit**.\n\nThe one who can **unify with spirit** ensures that **essence** does not depart from humanity while **spirit** does not depart from **qi**. When **spirit** and **qi** merge, the **form** is complete, and its function extends to **non-duality**—thus knowing that **non-spirit’s spirit** lies within me, not in another.\n\nThe **sun and moon** have their **fixed cycles**; the **great and small** have their **defined portions**. **Sagehood’s** work arises from this, and **spiritual clarity** emerges from it. The **sun** is yang; the **moon** is yin. **Yin and yang** are the **Dao/Way’s** functions. Thus, the **Dao/Way’s** functions operate through **nature**, ensuring the **sun and moon** have their **constant cycles** and the **great and small** their **defined portions**.\n\nThe **great** cannot surpass **Heaven and Earth**; the **small** does not exceed **humanity and things**. Though **humanity and things** are small, consider that among all things, humanity possesses its **spirit**, and its **nature** aligns with **Heaven’s**. Its **mechanisms** and **functions** are the same as the **One**—the small can emulate the **great Dao/Way’s** form, and **sagehood’s** work arises while **spiritual clarity** emerges.\n\nFurthermore, humanity’s birth receives **essence** from **Heaven’s One** to become the **source of wisdom**; **spirit** is obtained from **Heaven’s Five** to become the **root of nature**. When one attains this, they can **enter spirit** and **return to life**—thus knowing that though humanity’s **portion** is small, it can emulate **Heaven and Earth’s** greatness, and **sagehood’s** work arises, reaching the **sun and moon’s** cycles while **spiritual clarity** emerges.\n\nThe **classic** says: *\"Learning begins with becoming a scholar, and ends with becoming a sage.\"* For those who **learn the Dao/Way**, the **sun and moon’s** cycles must be known, and the **defined portions** of the **great and small** must be observed.\n\nMoreover, the **Dao/Way of Heaven** moves **three hundred sixty-five degrees** in one day and night, carrying the **sun and moon** along. The **sun’s** movement is slow, advancing **one degree** per day and night; the **moon’s** movement is swift, advancing **twelve degrees** per day and night. The **sun** completes a **full cycle** in one year; the **moon** completes a **full cycle** in one month. There are **twelve hours** in a day: six hours of yang, six hours of yin.\n\n**Heaven descends** and **Earth ascends**, merging once a day. Every **five days** symbolizes the **True One’s qi**; a month has **three hundred sixty times**, symbolizing the **fire’s** daily **alchemical process** in a year. The **moon** completes a **cycle** every **ten days**, merging on the **fifteenth** and exchanging on the **thirtieth**. At the **end of the month**, it **hides**; on the **first day**, it **rebirths**, perpetually cycling through **day and night**.",

      "translated_text": "「When the **Dao/Way**'s **virtue/power** is established, all things come to life; when the **divine brilliance** emerges, all things transform. Thus, the **sage** takes this as their standard, refining within a month to **usurp Heaven and Earth’s annual alchemical process** and establish the **Dao/Way**'s **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **sutra** states: *\"Thirty spokes converge at one hub.\"* Thus one knows that a month contains **three decads** (三旬). The first and last decads are times of **martial fire** (武火), while the middle decad, when the moon is at its fullest and brightest, is the time of **gentle fire** (文火). The **sutra** also says: *\"Martial fire at the beginning and end, gentle fire in the middle—this is the principle.\"*\n\nAgain it is said: *\"When the medicine is ready, the moon must be consulted as teacher.\"* And again: *\"Ascend beyond the sun and moon—I have attained the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\"* Therefore, the **Supreme Daoist Immortal** aligns with Heaven’s **fullness and emptiness**, entrusting themselves to the moon’s **fixed cycles**, emulating the great with the small, harmonizing with the **Great Principle** (大理) to comprehend that the Dao/Way transcends distinctions of small and great—this is clear.\n\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The sage aligns with the One of Heaven, while the common person aligns with the One of others.\"* This means that the **fixed distinctions** of great and small refer only to the **alignment of Heaven and humanity with the One**—its **subtle mechanisms** are visible to all yet understood by none.\n\nThe **virtuous** who grasp it preserve themselves, while the **petty** who grasp it risk their lives. The **Yellow Emperor** heard from the **Royal Person** (皇人) that **\"seeking life through the Dao/Way** must follow what gives birth to it,\"—this is the **Dao/Way’s subtle mechanism** in speech. The **enlightened adept** (達士) speaks of **\"martial arts to conquer and triumph over armies,\"**—the principle lies here.\n\nIf one can grasp the **mechanism**, it depends on preserving oneself; one must not indulge emotions and desires lightly, lest they **transgress the vital breath** and **deplete their life**.\n\n*Baopuzi* says: *\"Those skilled in the art can reverse the flow of life to replenish the brain.\"* Thus, what is **manifest in practice** yet **hidden in principle** is visible to all, yet none can truly comprehend it. The principle may be **plundered**, but the practice may be **discarded**—visible to all, yet none can truly grasp it.\n\nIf the principle can be **plundered**, it is because the Dao/Way alone can **seize it**; thus, the skilled in **plundering** may **force compliance**, but cannot **make known**—once known, the **cosmic vital breath** (冲炁) will not descend. The **mechanism’s** efficacy lies in its **secrecy**, yet all undertakings are accomplished through it. Only the **virtuous** can preserve themselves and **grasp the mechanism**.\n\nIf the **petty** see the principle and **plunder the mechanism**, they often fail to preserve themselves, and instead **suffer loss**,—this is **transgressing the vital breath** and **exhausting one’s fate**.\n\nThus, the **art of triumphing in battle** lies in **profound principles and deep mechanisms**; fearing the text’s complexity, I omit detailed exposition, but one may consult the *Taiyi Guoming Jindan Jingjue* to understand it fully.\n\nThe **blind** excel in hearing, the **deaf** excel in sight. **Cutting off one source of advantage**, one gains **tenfold** the teacher’s **virtue/power**; **three cycles of day and night**, one gains **ten thousandfold** the teacher’s **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **teacher** is a **model**; the **model** is the **standard**. Thus, the **standard** is the Dao/Way’s **constant**. Only the **standard** can **command the myriad transformations** and **stand independent above them**—this is **grasping the One Source’s standard** within the heart.\n\nThus, the **adepts of old** who grasped the **mechanism** instructed later generations, saying that **\"the **Supreme Dao/Way** of the Immortals and Divine Ones lies in embracing the One,\"**—the principle is here.\n\nSo the **blind**, unable to see, **specialize in hearing**; the **deaf**, unable to hear, **specialize in sight**. Both, through **focused vision and hearing**, surpass the ordinary by **tenfold** advantage—this is **grasping it in the heart**, learning from the **One Source’s standard**.\n\nThus, even the **deaf and blind**, though **sealed outside the Three Passes** (三关) and **isolated within**, can still gain **tenfold** advantage from the **One Source**. How much more so the **Daoist adept**, who **cycles through three returns of day and night**, **transcends ordinary vision and hearing**, **specializes in the One Source’s advantage**, and **learns from heart to heart**—will they not gain **ten thousandfold** advantage?\n\nThus, the **student** of the **Supreme Dao/Way** who embraces the **One** and preserves the **standard** must **return to the root** to **endure eternally**. **Returning to the root** is **restoring the original vital breath** (元炁).\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Harmonize with the One, and all undertakings are complete.\"* What is meant by **\"attaining the One is not to be divided,\" \"embracing the One is not to depart,\" \"preserving the One is not to stray\"**—only because **\"not being divided\"** allows one to **\"attain the One,\"** only because **\"not departing\"** allows one to **\"embrace the One,\"** only because **\"not straying\"** allows one to **\"preserve the One.\"**\n\nThus, the **method of preserving the One** depends on the heart **not wandering**; then the **nature** naturally **calms**, the **spirit** naturally **settles**, the **virtue/power** naturally **fulfills**, and the Dao/Way naturally **converges**.\n\nThe **Supreme Dao/Way** of the **Immortal and Divine Ones** began when the **Yellow Emperor** met the **Royal Person**, who asked: *\"Is there a **true One**’s divine **virtue/power** that can be heard?\"* The **Royal Person** was greatly startled and replied: *\"You are asking among the people—how could you hear this?\"* Then the **Yellow Emperor** ascended to the **Royal Master** (皇主) and recorded the first chapter, fearing the text’s complexity and unwilling to fully annotate it. One may instead consult the **Royal Person’s** *San Yi Tu Jing* (《三一图经》); upon reading it, the **details of embracing the One and preserving the Dao/Way** will be known.\n\nThe heart **is born from things** and **dies from things**; the **mechanism** lies in the eyes. When the **student** has practiced the **method of embracing the true and preserving the One**, if **disturbing thoughts** arise or the heart **fixes on things**, the key lies in **applying the eye’s mechanism** to **restrain those thoughts**.\n\nThe heart is the **master of the body** and the **commander of all spirits**; **exhaustion of the spirit** and **fatigue of thought** all stem from the heart. Thus, the heart has a **mechanism of action**—when confronted with things, it cannot avoid **perturbation**; when faced with intent, it cannot avoid **attachment**. Hence, the **heart’s eye** has **mutually dependent functions**, and **emotions and nature** have **mechanisms of selection and rejection**.\n\nWhen the heart **stirs from things**, it **dies to things** and **fixes on them**; once fixed, the **heart’s source** is no longer **One**, and the **spirit’s nature** becomes disordered—how could one gain **ten thousandfold** advantage?\n\nThus, the skilled in the Dao/Way, when the heart **fixes on things**, must **apply the eye’s mechanism**, **restraining the heart** so that all **defilements** are naturally **extinguished**.\n\nAt the moment of **extinguishing the heart**, one must **not perceive the heart’s fixation**, but rather **keep the eyes dimmed and fixedly gaze eastward**, like an **infant**—then the **spirit and vital breath** will not depart, and the heart will be **pure and clear**.\n\nAn **ancient poem** says:\n*\"Beard stained with blood, eyes like a ring—*\n*this is **applying the eye’s mechanism** to **extinguish the heart’s fixation**.\"*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: *\"Good at closing is like a gate with no bolt—*\n*yet it cannot be opened.\"* This is the **heart at rest** and **not fixed on things**.\n\nHeaven’s **virtue/power** is **without favor**, yet **great favor** arises. **Swift thunder** and **violent winds** all **act without hesitation**. The **greatness of its favor and awe** is none greater than that of **Heaven and Earth**; the **heart that receives its blessings** is none other than **humanity**’s.»",

Its **lack of interruption** lies in its **great benevolence and boundless favor**, extending to all beings, **only welcoming those who delight in virtue**, enabling them to **penetrate truth and attain the Dao**, entering the **domain of the Sage**.\n\nThe **classic** states:\n*\"The **Celestial Sovereign has no favorites**—only the virtuous does it assist.\"*\nThis means the **Dao has no distinctions of near or far**, nor of good or bad—**only when a person aligns with the Dao does the Dao itself open the way for them**. **Only the perfected** can receive **Heaven’s great favor**, becoming **companions with Heaven**. Even if **Heaven’s Dao** unleashes **ominous, stern, and killing qi**, or **deploys the might of swift thunder and violent winds**, the perfected remain **unfazed and fearless**, for their **senses are closed to the external**, while their **mind and intention are sealed within**.\n\n**Supreme joy** leaves **nature unspent**; **supreme stillness** brings **clarity**. **Empty and tranquil**, unmixed with things—this is the **substance of the Dao**. The **ancients who embodied the Dao** took **inner cultivation** as their pursuit, not delighting in **external engagement**, but simply **rejoicing in their nature**.\n\nWhen a person **rejoices in their nature**, it is not by **deliberate intent**—**returning to the One leaves no trace**, simply following **its natural course**.

Thus, **Heaven favors persons but not the Dao**; **applying the Dao is public but not partial to things**—this is **true public justice**.

Thus, for the **seeker of the Dao**, the key lies in **finding a wise teacher**, **nearing virtuous companions**, and **resolutely cultivating the will**, only then **entering the Sage’s gate**. **Heaven itself will not obstruct**; **responding to the numinous** depends on **cleansing the heart and mastering oneself**, **never abandoning the Dao-heart**—then **Heaven’s spirits will secretly aid**, and **the will must not falter**. If **seeking teachers and companions**, one finds the right ones—**then serve them**; if not, **press on steadfastly**, for **the body will be at ease**, and **the study of nature and life must not be neglected**.\n\n**Birds are governed by qi**. When **Heaven is empty**, qi **floats upward**; when qi **floats upward**, birds **use their feathers to govern qi**, flying and ascending.

When **spirit and qi unite**, the **true essence does not scatter**; the **spirit is at ease and the form is firm**—this is the work of qi.\n\nThe **human body** is a **manifestation of things**. If it **resembles things**, then **life and death are bound**, and **exhaustion comes with time**. The key lies in: **qi robust, spirit intact**; **qi decayed, spirit ruined**. The **classic** says: *\"Birds are governed by qi.\"* **Birds** means **to restrain**. **Restraint of the heart, governance of qi**.\n\nEven birds, **able to fly upward**, are like **human qi**—**filling the boundless void**, **supporting Heaven and Earth**, and **lifting the form to transcendence**. This is because **the heart is empty**, so **qi fills the great expanse**, **gathering with the Dao in emptiness**. *\"The empty chamber births white\"*—this is the ability to **nurture the One qi**, **governing it thus**.\n\nAs **Mencius** said:\n*\"I can nurture the **unbounded, noble qi**, filling the space between Heaven and Earth.\"*\nThis is **deeply attaining the way of governing qi**.\n\n**Life is the root of death**; **death is the root of life**. **Creation subtly shifts**; **yin and yang are unfathomable**. **Life arises from the spirit**; **death lies in the form**—this is the **unity of qi rooted in nature**. Thus, **life is the beginning of creation**; **death is the transformation of yin and yang**. **No two things flourish simultaneously**—this is yin and yang. Thus, **all things take form through yin and yang**, **transform through yin and yang**. The **classic** says: *\"Heaven gives life; Heaven takes life—this is the principle of the Dao.\"*\n\nThus, the **Great Dao** stems from **One qi**, **governing the movement of sun and moon**. **Sun and moon** are the **ancestors of yin and yang**, **mutually interacting**, **spreading qi to nurture life**. When **yang qi returns**, all things **are born**; when **yin qi completes**, all things **perish**. Thus, the **principle of life and death** originates in the **Dao-source**, **existing and vanishing like mist**.\n\nThe **human Dao** is also **bound to life and death**, **rooted in One qi**, **sensing the union of yin and yang from parents** to **be born**, and **dying when yin and yang’s measure is exhausted**. The key lies in **refining yin with yang**; when **yin dross is exhausted**, the **yang essence is perfected**, **One qi is complete**, and the **Dao flows naturally**—then **returning to the origin**, **reverting to the root**, and **restoring to the source** is achieved.\n\n**Favor arises from harm**; **harm arises from favor**. **Kindness as favor** brings **harm in its wake**. Thus, **favor and love mutually generate**—this is the **root of human emotional use**. **Seekers of the Dao** are often **entangled by favor and love**, **halting mid-path**, **abandoning halfway**, **beginning with diligence but ending in laziness**—is this not the **common plight of mortals**?\n\nThus, **self-inflicted harm** arises from **favor**, and **harm stems from favor**. The key lies in **knowing One qi permeates the numinous**; **ten thousand calamities will not intrude**; **a single body attaining the Dao**—**seven generations ascend to Heaven**. Those who **can resolutely advance on the Dao** will have **favor extend to themselves while harm does not**; the **unenlightened**, if they **do not eliminate the heart of favor and love**, will have **favor extend to others while harm befalls themselves**.\n\nThus, **the heart filled with favor and love** is the **delusion of the world**; **arousing emotions of honor and shame** is the **greed of the world**. Alas! **The harms of sorrow, toil, and injury**—why do they bring **joy to all under Heaven?**",

      "translated_text": "From this perspective, those who do not suffer harm are those whose favor and love run deep, for they are the hidden roots of calamity.\n\nYet those who truly walk the Dao are different. They take delight in the tranquil mind, honor emptiness, purify their hearts like washing in snow, and still their wills in silence—thus, favor does not extend to others, nor does harm befall themselves.\n\nThe foolish mistake the natural patterns of Heaven and Earth for sacred wisdom, while I see the profound order in the things of the moment. The daily necessities of life—those are the sacred elixirs nourishing the roots of the Dao.\n\nThus, people vary in virtue, and understanding runs deep or shallow. The wise possess keen insight, broad vision, and lofty resolve; the foolish are narrow in thought, low in perception, and speak with clumsy words.\n\nYet they fail to recognize that Heaven and Earth follow their natural laws, flowing eternally without change or deviation, their constancy unshaken. The foolish revere this as sacred, yet they do not perceive the profound order in the things of the moment that people use daily without knowing their true nature.\n\nThe Five Grains are the daily sustenance of all under Heaven. Yet the world seeks only to fill its belly, never probing the origins of transformation.\n\nIndeed, the Five Grains steal from Heaven and Earth’s creative force to grow, plundering the vital qi of yin and yang to ripen. Thus, one knows they are the true essence of Heaven and Earth’s unity. When they flourish and mature, humans consume them, absorbing their qi to prolong life. As they pass through the spleen and stomach, their essence transforms into the primordial true water of the Five Phases—this is the original source of the Five Elements. How could one not know that the essence and qi of the Five Grains are the sacred elixirs of Heaven and Earth, the radiant essence of the sun and moon, the refined marrow of the Five Phases? They nourish my life, enrich my qi, sustain my form, extend my years, preserve my spirit, and awaken my enlightenment.\n\nIs this not what I mean by calling the order of the things of the moment profound wisdom? —*Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* *Yin-Shang Jing*.",
