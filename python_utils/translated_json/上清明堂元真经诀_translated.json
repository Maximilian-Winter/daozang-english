  "full_translation": "**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection: Oral Instructions**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Oral Instructions on the Upper Clarity Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled from early Upper Clarity tradition cultivation instructions, it comprises two sections: *Oral Instructions on the Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection* and *Ingesting the Four Poles and Cloud-Teeth Transcendents of the Upper Realm*. Its literary style closely resembles *Declarations of the Perfected* and *Concealed Instructions for Ascending to Perfection*. One scroll. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Mystery Section, Jade Instructions Category.\n\n---\n\nThe Lady of the Nine Numina of the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, the Primordial Perfected Sovereign of the West, Queen Mother of the West, transmitted and expounded the *Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection*, saying:\n\n*\"The Supreme Mystery is profoundly mysterious; the two qi illumine with clarity. The Primordial Perfection inwardly radiates; the Luminous Hall outwardly purifies. Inhaling the twin luminaries, one attains long life and divine essence, ascending to replenish the Director of Destinies, overseeing the myriad spirits. The Six Flowers overflow, piercing through to the Yellow and Tranquil.\"*\n\nThese forty characters constitute the foundational scripture of Primordial Perfection. What follows are the Queen Mother of the West’s further expositions on the methods of practice—akin to the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, which takes the dragon as its principal focus. These forty characters were inscribed by the Supreme on the southern pavilion of the Phoenix Terrace. They are not taught to those who are not disciples of the Perfected Sovereign, nor transmitted to those who are not the chosen of the Director of Destinies.\n\nThose whose names are recorded in the Register of the Mysterious Chosen and are destined to be enrolled in the Register of the Director of Destinies must first practice this Way. Master Yang served as the divine overseer of Wu and Yue, and the Prefect was to be enfeoffed as a regional governor; thus, both received this transmission, though not all were disciples of the Perfected Sovereign. This is likely an expedient encouragement to spur practice.\n\n**The Method of Primordial Perfection:**\nThe Jade Woman holds the titles of Supreme Mystery and Upper Mystery, and her name is Primordial Perfection—hence the designation \"Primordial Perfection,\" which refers to her inner radiance. This is also the supreme method of the True Mystery. As the Eastern Minister stated, this is the Way of the True Mystery—essential yet unburdensome.\n\n**Visualizing the Sun and Moon within the Mouth:**\nInitially, one ingests the Jade Woman’s fluid, causing the forms of the sun and moon to enter the mouth, their radiant mists pouring in. Later, they return to the Luminous Hall, ascending from the mouth. If one does not visualize this Jade Woman, one may use the simpler method described later: first visualize the sun and moon, each as large as a ring, within the mouth.\n\nDuring the day, visualize the sun; at midnight, visualize the moon. Alternatively, one may visualize without distinguishing between day and night. Another method is to alternate between day and night in visualization. Generally, methods involving the sun and moon do not require such distinctions, nor do they separate dawn and dusk into two practices.\n\nHere, \"day\" refers to the entire daylight period, and \"night\" to the entire night, not specifically noon or midnight. Thus, the later instructions state: \"alternately visualize the sun by day and the moon by night.\" If one visualizes only once per day and night, the optimal time is when the sun or moon first rises. One may proceed immediately after recording the time. For more frequent practice, three times each day and night is appropriate. During the day, face the sun; at night, face the moon. Sit upright, close the eyes, and clasp the hands. On cloudy days or when the moon is not visible, face its general direction.\n\nThe sun’s color is red, the moon’s yellow. The sun emits nine rays of purple light; the moon, ten rays of white light. Position the sun and moon nine feet from the mouth, their rays directed toward it, straight as a bowstring, entering the mouth.\n\nInitially, visualize the sun and moon in the sky, as large and luminous as they appear now. Gradually, they descend, their forms shrinking until, nine feet from the mouth, they become perfectly round like pellets, brilliantly radiant. The \"nine rays of purple light\" refer to the nine rays emanating from the sun. Each ray possesses its own luminous hue, adhering to the prescribed number. They spread from the edges of the sun and moon, encircling them and pointing directly toward the practitioner.\n\nFor example, when visualizing the sun, bend the rays from its eastern edge and those from its upper, lower, southern, and northern edges, directing them all—along with the western ray—toward the mouth like the eastern string of a bow. Do not allow the rays to scatter in all directions.\n\nNext, visualize within the sun and moon a woman wearing a purple kerchief and a crimson brocade robe and skirt. She calls herself the Jade Woman of Cinnabar Mist of the Supreme Mystery and Upper Mystery, her taboo name *Chánxuán* and her style *Mìzhēn*. After fully visualizing the sun and its rays, further visualize a woman seated reverently within the sun, hands clasped. She is three feet tall, her form and countenance jade-like and resplendent. She wears a purple lotus-flower kerchief, a brocade robe of deep red, a vermilion flying skirt, and a green-white sash. Facing the practitioner’s mouth, she kneels and declares: \"I am the Jade Woman of Cinnabar Mist of the Supreme Mystery and Upper Mystery, my taboo name *Chánxuán*, my style *Mìzhēn*.\" Then she opens her mouth and exhales a red qi.\n\nThe red qi fills the space between the sun’s rays, merging with the radiant mist to pour entirely into the practitioner’s mouth. According to the later incantation, \"Exiting the sun, entering the moon,\" this refers to the incantation used when ingesting the moon. Here, the text mentions exhaling crimson qi; when ingesting the moon, the Jade Woman should also exhale red qi. Both the qi and the rays intertwine and enter the practitioner’s mouth together. The term \"radiant mist\" here refers to the red light surrounding the rays, hence the title *Jade Woman of Cinnabar Mist*. The moon’s rays also possess this quality.\n\nThe practitioner swallows the qi, and with each exhalation from the Jade Woman, the practitioner swallows once. After ninety swallowings, visualize the sun and moon’s light closely approaching the practitioner’s face.\n\nWith each exhalation from the Jade Woman, the practitioner swallows once. The first thirty swallowings direct the qi to the Palace of Life’s Gate; the next thirty to the Crimson Palace; the final thirty to the Mud Pill Palace. The combined light flows through the four limbs, illuminating the five viscera. Gradually, the sun and moon draw nearer. With each swallowing, the light advances one inch. After ninety swallowings, the light reaches the mouth, ascending to the tip of the nose and descending to the chin. The radiance is brilliantly clear, and the heat is intensely felt. The Jade Woman’s form also diminishes in size along with the sun.\n\nHave the Jade Woman sip at my mouth, allowing her qi and fluids to descend into my mouth. The Jade Woman remains within the sun and moon, her head and mouth aligned directly with mine, so that the crimson qi and cinnabar fluids flow into my lips and teeth. Do not swallow yet—only after the incantation is complete may you then swallow.\n\nI softly recite the invocation:\n*\"Purple Perfection of the Great Empyrean,\nYin spirit of the Hall of Light,\nEssence born of sun and moon,\nJade Woman coiling in revolution,\nFirst from empty drool,\nHer secret name is Hidden Perfection.\nHer head wraps in purple blossoms,\nHer crown is of lotus spirit,\nHer body draped in brocade robes,\nHer skirts of vermilion flight.\nEmerging from the sun, entering the moon,\nHeaven’s radiance, secluded fragrance,\nHer mouth exhales crimson qi,\nIrrigating my Three Origins.\nHer face speaks of the Celestial Well,\nSoftening the po soul, restraining the hun,\nMysterious fluids flow and circulate,\nFetal essence grows complete,\nThe five viscera bloom with splendor,\nOpening the childlike, reversing the years,\nOverseeing the ten thousand spirits,\nCommanding life, ascending as a flying immortal.\"*\n\nWithin these eleven lines, when serving the sun, one may adjust the rhyme to say *\"emerging from the moon, entering the sun.\"*\n\nOnce finished, visualize the Jade Woman’s mouth and fluids pouring into my own, the flow unbroken as before. Only after the incantation concludes should you swallow as she exhales. I then gather the fluids and swallow them, repeating this ninety times. The fluids she exhales retain a crimson hue. With each exhalation and swallowing, the three palaces follow in sequence as before. When the count is complete, the Jade Woman’s form rises, entering my mouth alongside the sun and moon. Hold them within for a long while, then return them to the Hall of Light, where the sun rests within the Yellow Gate on the right. Focus the mind and direct the intention—here the practice is complete. Cultivate this with a tranquil heart and devoted feeling, practicing as often as possible without limit. Thus, one may perform this day or night without restriction, not merely three times. However, as this luminous count grows, one may also engage in other practices, though thoughts may become entangled. If visualizing the sun, do not visualize the moon; if visualizing the moon, do not visualize the sun—one cannot hold both simultaneously. They must be visualized in balance.\n\nThis means one should not favor one method over the other; the number of visualizations for sun and moon by day and night must be equal—three for the sun by day, three for the moon by night. If unable to serve them at the proper time, visualize the two luminaries returning to the Hall of Light, the sun on the left and the moon on the right, their radiance merging with the pupils of the eyes, the four reflections of the two qi interpenetrating. When not in the serving phase, one should still contemplate the sun and moon within the Hall of Light, their crimson and yellow lights, purple and white rays, uniting with the pupils to illuminate the face and body, their brilliance suffusing the Nine Palaces. While seated, maintain this contemplation, for at this time, sun and moon converge without distinction between day and night. This is why such visualization is necessary outside the serving phase—during serving, sun and moon cannot occupy the same space.\n\nOne may also constantly visualize the sun and moon within the Hall of Light, not only the two luminaries where the Jade Woman resides. This means the Hall of Light always contains its own refined essence, which one should contemplate in sitting or lying down, as if truly seeing it. After five years of practice, the Jade Woman of the Great Mystery will descend to you, sharing your rest and repose. The Jade Woman of the Great Mystery can also divide her form into dozens of jade maidens, ready to be commanded at will. This is the culmination of accumulated essence and refined resonance, the manifestation of spiritual response—supreme refinement, the marvel of mutual resonance.\n\nThe \"Great Mystery\" is the realm where sun and moon reside; the Jade Woman is also the daughter of the Sun and Moon’s Consorts. Her responsive form may share in your repose and wanderings, but this is not a union of coupling. During the earlier practice of sipping fluids from her mouth, if the heart harbors even slight disturbance, there will be no path for her descent. Only with inner and outer equanimity can fruition be achieved. Later, though her divided forms and scattered radiance may be commanded, her true essence remains difficult to attain.\n\nWhen the Perfected One of the Great Origin first studied the Dao on Mount Chang, he dreamed of the Jade Woman of the Great Mystery holding a jade tablet and leading him to the Western City—this was she. Later, he indeed received and practiced the Mystery Perfection, for his sincerity and devotion had already summoned this omen. The Perfected Officials of the Supreme employ the Way of Sunlit Rosy Clouds and the method of drawing from the two luminaries, enabling one to commune with spirits, attain perfection, embody jade-like radiance, command the ten thousand spirits, and ascend to the Celestial Chambers.\n\nThe \"Perfected Officials of the Supreme\" refer to those who govern life. Long ago, the Perfected One of Mount Zhong taught the Way to Yu the Great—this was the Mystery Perfection method, though it was but a brief excerpt without the coiling and revolving practices. According to the preface of the *Sword Classic*, Yu the Great served the Numinous Treasure and practiced the Nine Perfections. The *Five Talismans* also records that the Perfected One of Mount Zhong taught Yu the method of serving the sun, moon, and five planets—all differing from the present account. The absence of coiling and revolving here likely refers to the later transmission from the Eastern Minister, for the initial teachings to his two disciples were also singular methods.\n\nThis transmission has fully expounded the principles of Mystery Perfection. Only the inner true talismans of the yin and yang luminaries remain in the *Golden Book of Scriptures*, yet to circulate in the world. Formerly, the Controller of Destinies received Mystery Perfection from the Queen Mother, along with the comprehensive true instructions. After three years of practice, his complexion became like a maiden’s, his body emanating flowing light, his face bearing the luster of jade. Later, he taught the method of visualization to his two disciples. With wholehearted devotion and focused contemplation, within three years, their divine radiance manifested. Only then did they receive the coiling and revolving practices, thus attaining the rank of Definitive Record and Guardian of Life.\n\nThe Eastern Minister, Controller of Destinies, said: \"My former teacher, Perfected Lord Wang, once received the *Supreme Scripture of the Hall of Light and Mystery Perfection*. After purifying through fasting and abstaining from grains, he visualized the sun and moon within his mouth—by day the sun, by night the moon—making them as large as rings. The sun was crimson with nine rays of purple light; the moon was yellow with ten rays of white light. He visualized and swallowed the fluids of their radiance, practicing this in secret without count.\"\n\nShould one cease the practice of visualization, let the sun and moon return to dwell within the Hall of Light upon the face—with the sun residing on the left and the moon on the right—so that the two luminaries merge their qi with the pupils of the eyes. This Dao gathers and circulates generative essence, harmonizes the hun-soul and spirit, commands the attendance of the Six Dings, and secures the protection of celestial soldiers. This is the Dao of the Supreme Perfected.\n\nThe *Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious Perfection* must first be sworn to before its practices are undertaken; only afterward may one hear of the Dao of Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings. Formerly, Ji Wei maintained a long fast for three years, devoting himself to single-minded contemplation, and thus attained it. Only then did his divine radiance suffuse his body, and only afterward did he receive the scripture.\n\nThis Dao of Mysterious Perfection is essential yet unburdensome. I have long treasured and concealed it, keeping it close at hand, and now reveal it to you—guard it with utmost secrecy. This is indeed the method that Lord Yu of Xia once received. The Controller of Destinies has now first transmitted this concise and accessible formula to Master Yang, intending that the Prefect practice it. At present, the Prefect’s numinous pool remains turbid, so the matters of the Jade Maidens are temporarily withheld; they shall be revealed later through expedient transmission of the records—this is what is meant by \"proceeding step-by-step in the Mysterious Perfection.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Hall of Light and Mysterious Perfection* exists independently, though its text is brief. The essentials lie in oral instructions, which are precisely as described here. Formerly, Wei did not possess the scripture but practiced according to these instructions and only later obtained it. If you wish to receive it, you may seek it from Wei. The *Hidden Book of Jade Pendants* is not something Wei has seen.\n\nThe scripture referred to is that recorded in the transmission above. When it says, \"If you wish to obtain it,\" it means Master Yang may seek the concise version. The Dao of Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings is a secret of the Eastern Minister; though it shares a category with the Mysterious Perfection and both involve the Way of the Sun and Moon, I mention this lest Master Yang request it from either of the two Lords.\n\nWhen traveling at night or lying in darkness, should fear arise in the heart, visualize the sun and moon returning to the Hall of Light. In an instant, all demonic influences will vanish. It is best to practice this regularly. This visualization is the same as that used when not ingesting the luminous fluids. When dwelling in secluded mountains, if one senses impending trials, it is fitting to constantly visualize to repel them. This formula is separately transmitted in the *Declarations of the Perfected* and is not recorded in the transmission above. Since it pertains to the affairs of the Mysterious Perfection, I have included it here. Those who practice the Dao of the Jade Maidens need not cultivate this, which is why no further commentary is provided.\n\n**Teachings Transmitted by Mao**\nOriginally four matters, now only one is taken.\n\nThe Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate ingests the Four Poles and Cloud-Teeth, ascending as an immortal of the highest realm.\n\nThe female disciple Wei Huacun received the method from the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, consisting of twelve characters with original annotations.\n\nThe Perfected embraces the primordial dawn radiance of the Five Directions and consumes the essence of the Nine Auroras. Thus, his divine radiance shines inwardly, while vermilion splendor manifests outwardly. His body emanates jade-like luster, and his form harmonizes with luminous qi. After practicing for ten years, the Elder of the Central Pole of the Four Extremes descended and united with him. Riding clouds and driving dragons, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe Elders of the Five Directions refer to the spontaneous spirits of the Five Directions, not the constructs of worldly learning. The wonders of ten years’ practice—how swiftly they unfold! Truly, this is the marvelous Dao of empty discourse and the secret method of exhalation and inhalation.\n\nFormerly, the Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate, Master Xiliang, received the oral instructions of the Most High. For a thousand years, it was transmitted five times, never to be recklessly divulged. The statutes of the Four Clarities follow the regulations of the hidden books: a five-day fast is required before transmission, and a covenant is established with the master, pledging five golden rings—one for each direction—as tokens of the oath between heaven and humanity, ensuring secrecy.\n\nThe five-day fast and the five-directional pledge pertain to those still in the world. Formerly, when Lord Wang resided in Huayin, he received the transmission in a single day, fully enlightened. In mountain forests, one maintains a perpetual fast; the oath is a matter of sincere devotion.\n\nAfter transmitting the method of Azure Essence, the Perfected of Xiliang also bestowed this practice, for its principles mutually support the cultivation of the sun, harmonizing emptiness and fullness.\n\n\"Five pairs for the Five Directions\" refers to aligning with the functions of the Five Directions. Alternatively, the Perfected may have called a pair a \"direction,\" hence the oral instructions clarify this—five pairs of rings. Additionally, five ounces of azure silk are used, as per the method of the Perfected of Xiliang. This is the original annotation to the oral instructions, spoken by Lady Wang.\n\nThis original red-inked annotation was written by Master Yang, as dictated by the Lady.\n\nFacing east, knock the teeth nine times and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Azure Teeth of the East, purple clouds streaming with auroras,\nThree Pures meandering, dark frost and jade gauze.\nConsume the morning radiance, drink the dawn’s blossoms.\"*\n(Three rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, lick the outside of the upper lip with the tongue, gather the saliva, and swallow thirty times. With each lick, collect the fluid and swallow once, visualizing the liquid as azure and directing it into the liver. After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Eastern Pole will arrive, bestow upon you the *Azure Perfection*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Azure Perfection* is the name of a scripture.\n\nNext, face south, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Vermilion Cinnabar of the South, auroras illuminating the Great Subtlety,\nNine paths of crimson mist, scattering luminous splendor.\nConsume the numinous dawn, drink from the Cinnabar Pool.\"*\n(Three rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, lick the outside of the lower lip with the tongue, gather the saliva, and swallow thirty times. Visualize the liquid as crimson and direct it into the heart. These two methods both involve licking the fluids from outside the chest, hence the inclusion of the word \"lick.\" After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Southern Pole will arrive in full, bestow upon you the *Cinnabar Radiance*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Cinnabar Radiance* is the name of a scripture.\n\nNext, face west, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Luminous Stone of the West, flying auroras and golden liquid,\nConsume the Great Brightness, the essence of the White Numinous.\nDrink the Jade Nectar, divine splendor awakens the numinous,\nEnabling me to ascend the void, rising to the lofty clarity.\"*\n(Four rhymes.)\n\nThe character *shen* may be a variant of *chen* (dawn).\n\nUpon completing the incantation, lick the inside of the upper lip with the tongue, gather the fluids, and swallow the saliva thirty times. Visualize the liquid as white and direct it into the lungs. After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Western Pole will arrive in full, bestow upon you the *Numinous Power of the White Spirit*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Numinous Power of the White Spirit* is the name of six talismans.\n\nNext, face north, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Dark Essence of the North, auspicious clouds stir the embryo,\nGreen auroras spread the dawn, purple canopies and azure banners,\nConsume the radiance of the moon, drink the nectar of jade.\"*\n(Three rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, lick the inside of the lower lip with the tongue, gather the fluids, and swallow the saliva thirty times. Visualize the liquid as dark and direct it into the two kidneys. After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Northern Pole will arrive in full, bestow upon you the *Mysterious Register of Precious Brilliance*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Mysterious Register of Precious Brilliance* is the name of a scripture.\n\nNext, sit facing south, look upward, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Primal Essence of Wu and Ji, yellow and white, fivefold clouds,\nFour auroras and purple visions, eight luminaries and nine dawns,\nDual brightness radiates splendor, seven luminaries and numinous lords,\nHarmonize essence and irrigate qi, consume the Central Primal,\nJade radiance and dragon embryo, drink the sweet spring of immortality.\"*\n(Five rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, rinse the mouth with saliva until full, swirling it within and without the dark cavity, between teeth and tongue, encompassing all surfaces. Gather the fluids and swallow forty times—this means rinsing once fully before each swallow. Visualize the liquid as yellow and direct it into the spleen. These forty characters were originally written as thirty in the authentic text; later additions were made in clerical script, though the original brushstrokes remain discernible. This method corresponds to the central direction, uniting the four quarters, akin to the meaning of the *Gate of the Quelling Star*.\n\nAfter ten years of practice, the Central Primordial Lady and the Supreme Yellow Elder will descend, bestowing upon you the *Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Hidden Heaven, Concealed Moon, Reclusive Radiance, Record of Chapters, Azure Essentials, and Tiger Script*—ascending together with the Four Elders. This central method encompasses scriptures, talismans, and chapters in three volumes.\n\nThese are the supreme oral instructions of the *Jade Scripture*, the Way of summoning the Five Elders. They enable abstention from grains, elimination of the corpse-worms, rejuvenation of the complexion, immunity to cold and heat, and protection from disasters and harms. The spirit becomes luminous and clear, years are prolonged, and lifespan extended by ten thousand years—an epochal limit. One shall attain the *Ninefold Jade Elixir* and the *Eightfold Flying Essence of Jade*, merging the two ultimate radiant forces to harmonize with heaven and earth. This pertains specifically to the division of *Cloud Teeth*.\n\nAll five yin incantations require knocking the teeth nine times. They may be practiced regularly, not solely at cockcrow or dawn; midnight, seated in quietude within a still chamber, with a tranquil body and serene spirit, is also suitable. Previously, knocking the teeth was only mentioned for the eastern direction, but now it is clarified for all directions. The *Five Peaks* are also named *Bamboo Shoots*, and each direction involves breath-holding.\n\nFor those who cultivate *Guardian Unity*, if they learn this Way, their practice will swiftly come to fruition. With emptiness and tranquility filling the inner self, preserving the primal and swallowing fluids—this is what is called *True Unity*, the self-seeking of abundant blessings. Invoking the spirit through the six fluids and five qi, for the qi is already self-sufficient—hence it is said to be the self-seeking of abundant blessings.\n\nIn practicing this Way, strictly avoid consuming dried meats. If hunger arises, eat wheat-based foods, gradually reducing grain intake, but do not abandon it abruptly in a single day. This is what is meant by *\"diminish and diminish again, until reaching non-action.\"* To practice this grain-abstention is superior even to the *Azure Essence* method, the supreme Way of rejecting grains. However, one must remain in stillness and detachment, free from distractions, and practice diligently over the years to reap the benefits. If one engages in miscellaneous affairs alongside this practice, the body may not endure the strain, failing to achieve the mutual nourishment of internal and external, food and qi. This also depends on the individual’s physical constitution—whether robust or weak, young or old—and cannot be uniformly applied in a single measure.\n\nThough one may have received this method in the past, praised and extolled it, yet ultimately not practiced it, this may be due to their lofty and transcendent vocation. Nevertheless, it is fitting to follow its traces from afar. This is the Way of *Vacuous Reflection*, the method of spontaneity—what is meant by *\"drawing afar from the essence of heaven and earth, and drawing near from one’s own body.\"*\n\n*Cloud Teeth* are the refined qi of the Five Elders, the auroras and mists of the Great Ultimate. Thus, one gathers the radiant essence of their peaks to harmonize the six fluids, penetrating the obscure and evoking response. The numinous and the hidden seek one another, answering without a call. Therefore, when the dragon intones across the ten thousand abysses, radiant clouds descend from the heavens; when the tiger roars upon the sacred mound, the surging winds shake the four directions. The yang burning-mirror summons brightness, and crimson flames arise; the *Fangzhu* vessel captures yin, and dark streams overflow—all occurring naturally, beyond comprehension.\n\nFor the practitioner who dwells in the heart and focuses on the mysterious, delving into the roots of the Dao, impurities are dispelled from the breast, and true correctness resides in the Three Palaces. One gathers the scattered radiance of the five dawns, consumes the auroral nectar of the six sweet springs, invokes the rare treasures of the nine heavens, and utters the secret words of profound wonder. The dragon leaps, emitting radiance, and sevenfold brilliance shines; one savors the threefold flowers upon the white teeth, takes fullness of fluid from the lips’ edge, internally refines the six viscera, and opens clarity and insight. Breathing the primal of heaven, refining the hun and po to transform the body, summoning the dark and causing it to vanish—thus attaining the numinous. After ten tranquil years, the Five Spirits will descend—what need is there for further praise?\n\nThough frail as a woman, I have undertaken the supreme practice of this scripture. My humble voice, a fading echo, cannot be widely proclaimed; I merely recount its wonders to share with like-minded seekers. If one’s cultivation of virtue is insufficient, they ought not be faulted for disparaging it.\n\nRecorded by the Lady of the Southern Peak.\n\nHere concludes the oral instructions transmitted by Wang.\n\nAnnotations irrelevant to immediate practice have been omitted.\n\nThus ends the *Instructions on the Scripture of the Luminous Hall of Primordial Perfection*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection: Oral Instructions**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Oral Instructions on the Upper Clarity Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled from early Upper Clarity tradition cultivation instructions, it comprises two sections: *Oral Instructions on the Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection* and *Ingesting the Four Poles and Cloud-Teeth Transcendents of the Upper Realm*. Its literary style closely resembles *Declarations of the Perfected* and *Concealed Instructions for Ascending to Perfection*. One scroll. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Mystery Section, Jade Instructions Category.\n\n---\n\nThe Lady of the Nine Numina of the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, the Primordial Perfected Sovereign of the West, Queen Mother of the West, transmitted and expounded the *Scripture of the Luminous Hall and Primordial Perfection*, saying:\n\n*\"The Supreme Mystery is profoundly mysterious; the two qi illumine with clarity. The Primordial Perfection inwardly radiates; the Luminous Hall outwardly purifies. Inhaling the twin luminaries, one attains long life and divine essence, ascending to replenish the Director of Destinies, overseeing the myriad spirits. The Six Flowers overflow, piercing through to the Yellow and Tranquil.\"*\n\nThese forty characters constitute the foundational scripture of Primordial Perfection. What follows are the Queen Mother of the West’s further expositions on the methods of practice—akin to the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, which takes the dragon as its principal focus. These forty characters were inscribed by the Supreme on the southern pavilion of the Phoenix Terrace. They are not taught to those who are not disciples of the Perfected Sovereign, nor transmitted to those who are not the chosen of the Director of Destinies.\n\nThose whose names are recorded in the Register of the Mysterious Chosen and are destined to be enrolled in the Register of the Director of Destinies must first practice this Way. Master Yang served as the divine overseer of Wu and Yue, and the Prefect was to be enfeoffed as a regional governor; thus, both received this transmission, though not all were disciples of the Perfected Sovereign. This is likely an expedient encouragement to spur practice.\n\n**The Method of Primordial Perfection:**\nThe Jade Woman holds the titles of Supreme Mystery and Upper Mystery, and her name is Primordial Perfection—hence the designation \"Primordial Perfection,\" which refers to her inner radiance. This is also the supreme method of the True Mystery. As the Eastern Minister stated, this is the Way of the True Mystery—essential yet unburdensome.\n\n**Visualizing the Sun and Moon within the Mouth:**\nInitially, one ingests the Jade Woman’s fluid, causing the forms of the sun and moon to enter the mouth, their radiant mists pouring in. Later, they return to the Luminous Hall, ascending from the mouth. If one does not visualize this Jade Woman, one may use the simpler method described later: first visualize the sun and moon, each as large as a ring, within the mouth.\n\nDuring the day, visualize the sun; at midnight, visualize the moon. Alternatively, one may visualize without distinguishing between day and night. Another method is to alternate between day and night in visualization. Generally, methods involving the sun and moon do not require such distinctions, nor do they separate dawn and dusk into two practices.\n\nHere, \"day\" refers to the entire daylight period, and \"night\" to the entire night, not specifically noon or midnight. Thus, the later instructions state: \"alternately visualize the sun by day and the moon by night.\" If one visualizes only once per day and night, the optimal time is when the sun or moon first rises. One may proceed immediately after recording the time. For more frequent practice, three times each day and night is appropriate. During the day, face the sun; at night, face the moon. Sit upright, close the eyes, and clasp the hands. On cloudy days or when the moon is not visible, face its general direction.\n\nThe sun’s color is red, the moon’s yellow. The sun emits nine rays of purple light; the moon, ten rays of white light. Position the sun and moon nine feet from the mouth, their rays directed toward it, straight as a bowstring, entering the mouth.\n\nInitially, visualize the sun and moon in the sky, as large and luminous as they appear now. Gradually, they descend, their forms shrinking until, nine feet from the mouth, they become perfectly round like pellets, brilliantly radiant. The \"nine rays of purple light\" refer to the nine rays emanating from the sun. Each ray possesses its own luminous hue, adhering to the prescribed number. They spread from the edges of the sun and moon, encircling them and pointing directly toward the practitioner.\n\nFor example, when visualizing the sun, bend the rays from its eastern edge and those from its upper, lower, southern, and northern edges, directing them all—along with the western ray—toward the mouth like the eastern string of a bow. Do not allow the rays to scatter in all directions.\n\nNext, visualize within the sun and moon a woman wearing a purple kerchief and a crimson brocade robe and skirt. She calls herself the Jade Woman of Cinnabar Mist of the Supreme Mystery and Upper Mystery, her taboo name *Chánxuán* and her style *Mìzhēn*. After fully visualizing the sun and its rays, further visualize a woman seated reverently within the sun, hands clasped. She is three feet tall, her form and countenance jade-like and resplendent. She wears a purple lotus-flower kerchief, a brocade robe of deep red, a vermilion flying skirt, and a green-white sash. Facing the practitioner’s mouth, she kneels and declares: \"I am the Jade Woman of Cinnabar Mist of the Supreme Mystery and Upper Mystery, my taboo name *Chánxuán*, my style *Mìzhēn*.\" Then she opens her mouth and exhales a red qi.\n\nThe red qi fills the space between the sun’s rays, merging with the radiant mist to pour entirely into the practitioner’s mouth. According to the later incantation, \"Exiting the sun, entering the moon,\" this refers to the incantation used when ingesting the moon. Here, the text mentions exhaling crimson qi; when ingesting the moon, the Jade Woman should also exhale red qi. Both the qi and the rays intertwine and enter the practitioner’s mouth together. The term \"radiant mist\" here refers to the red light surrounding the rays, hence the title *Jade Woman of Cinnabar Mist*. The moon’s rays also possess this quality.\n\nThe practitioner swallows the qi, and with each exhalation from the Jade Woman, the practitioner swallows once. After ninety swallowings, visualize the sun and moon’s light closely approaching the practitioner’s face.\n\nWith each exhalation from the Jade Woman, the practitioner swallows once. The first thirty swallowings direct the qi to the Palace of Life’s Gate; the next thirty to the Crimson Palace; the final thirty to the Mud Pill Palace. The combined light flows through the four limbs, illuminating the five viscera. Gradually, the sun and moon draw nearer. With each swallowing, the light advances one inch. After ninety swallowings, the light reaches the mouth, ascending to the tip of the nose and descending to the chin. The radiance is brilliantly clear, and the heat is intensely felt. The Jade Woman’s form also diminishes in size along with the sun.",

      "translated_text": "Have the Jade Woman sip at my mouth, allowing her qi and fluids to descend into my mouth. The Jade Woman remains within the sun and moon, her head and mouth aligned directly with mine, so that the crimson qi and cinnabar fluids flow into my lips and teeth. Do not swallow yet—only after the incantation is complete may you then swallow.\n\nI softly recite the invocation:\n*\"Purple Perfection of the Great Empyrean,\nYin spirit of the Hall of Light,\nEssence born of sun and moon,\nJade Woman coiling in revolution,\nFirst from empty drool,\nHer secret name is Hidden Perfection.\nHer head wraps in purple blossoms,\nHer crown is of lotus spirit,\nHer body draped in brocade robes,\nHer skirts of vermilion flight.\nEmerging from the sun, entering the moon,\nHeaven’s radiance, secluded fragrance,\nHer mouth exhales crimson qi,\nIrrigating my Three Origins.\nHer face speaks of the Celestial Well,\nSoftening the po soul, restraining the hun,\nMysterious fluids flow and circulate,\nFetal essence grows complete,\nThe five viscera bloom with splendor,\nOpening the childlike, reversing the years,\nOverseeing the ten thousand spirits,\nCommanding life, ascending as a flying immortal.\"*\n\nWithin these eleven lines, when serving the sun, one may adjust the rhyme to say *\"emerging from the moon, entering the sun.\"*\n\nOnce finished, visualize the Jade Woman’s mouth and fluids pouring into my own, the flow unbroken as before. Only after the incantation concludes should you swallow as she exhales. I then gather the fluids and swallow them, repeating this ninety times. The fluids she exhales retain a crimson hue. With each exhalation and swallowing, the three palaces follow in sequence as before. When the count is complete, the Jade Woman’s form rises, entering my mouth alongside the sun and moon. Hold them within for a long while, then return them to the Hall of Light, where the sun rests within the Yellow Gate on the right. Focus the mind and direct the intention—here the practice is complete. Cultivate this with a tranquil heart and devoted feeling, practicing as often as possible without limit. Thus, one may perform this day or night without restriction, not merely three times. However, as this luminous count grows, one may also engage in other practices, though thoughts may become entangled. If visualizing the sun, do not visualize the moon; if visualizing the moon, do not visualize the sun—one cannot hold both simultaneously. They must be visualized in balance.\n\nThis means one should not favor one method over the other; the number of visualizations for sun and moon by day and night must be equal—three for the sun by day, three for the moon by night. If unable to serve them at the proper time, visualize the two luminaries returning to the Hall of Light, the sun on the left and the moon on the right, their radiance merging with the pupils of the eyes, the four reflections of the two qi interpenetrating. When not in the serving phase, one should still contemplate the sun and moon within the Hall of Light, their crimson and yellow lights, purple and white rays, uniting with the pupils to illuminate the face and body, their brilliance suffusing the Nine Palaces. While seated, maintain this contemplation, for at this time, sun and moon converge without distinction between day and night. This is why such visualization is necessary outside the serving phase—during serving, sun and moon cannot occupy the same space.\n\nOne may also constantly visualize the sun and moon within the Hall of Light, not only the two luminaries where the Jade Woman resides. This means the Hall of Light always contains its own refined essence, which one should contemplate in sitting or lying down, as if truly seeing it. After five years of practice, the Jade Woman of the Great Mystery will descend to you, sharing your rest and repose. The Jade Woman of the Great Mystery can also divide her form into dozens of jade maidens, ready to be commanded at will. This is the culmination of accumulated essence and refined resonance, the manifestation of spiritual response—supreme refinement, the marvel of mutual resonance.\n\nThe \"Great Mystery\" is the realm where sun and moon reside; the Jade Woman is also the daughter of the Sun and Moon’s Consorts. Her responsive form may share in your repose and wanderings, but this is not a union of coupling. During the earlier practice of sipping fluids from her mouth, if the heart harbors even slight disturbance, there will be no path for her descent. Only with inner and outer equanimity can fruition be achieved. Later, though her divided forms and scattered radiance may be commanded, her true essence remains difficult to attain.\n\nWhen the Perfected One of the Great Origin first studied the Dao on Mount Chang, he dreamed of the Jade Woman of the Great Mystery holding a jade tablet and leading him to the Western City—this was she. Later, he indeed received and practiced the Mystery Perfection, for his sincerity and devotion had already summoned this omen. The Perfected Officials of the Supreme employ the Way of Sunlit Rosy Clouds and the method of drawing from the two luminaries, enabling one to commune with spirits, attain perfection, embody jade-like radiance, command the ten thousand spirits, and ascend to the Celestial Chambers.\n\nThe \"Perfected Officials of the Supreme\" refer to those who govern life. Long ago, the Perfected One of Mount Zhong taught the Way to Yu the Great—this was the Mystery Perfection method, though it was but a brief excerpt without the coiling and revolving practices. According to the preface of the *Sword Classic*, Yu the Great served the Numinous Treasure and practiced the Nine Perfections. The *Five Talismans* also records that the Perfected One of Mount Zhong taught Yu the method of serving the sun, moon, and five planets—all differing from the present account. The absence of coiling and revolving here likely refers to the later transmission from the Eastern Minister, for the initial teachings to his two disciples were also singular methods.\n\nThis transmission has fully expounded the principles of Mystery Perfection. Only the inner true talismans of the yin and yang luminaries remain in the *Golden Book of Scriptures*, yet to circulate in the world. Formerly, the Controller of Destinies received Mystery Perfection from the Queen Mother, along with the comprehensive true instructions. After three years of practice, his complexion became like a maiden’s, his body emanating flowing light, his face bearing the luster of jade. Later, he taught the method of visualization to his two disciples. With wholehearted devotion and focused contemplation, within three years, their divine radiance manifested. Only then did they receive the coiling and revolving practices, thus attaining the rank of Definitive Record and Guardian of Life.\n\nThe Eastern Minister, Controller of Destinies, said: \"My former teacher, Perfected Lord Wang, once received the *Supreme Scripture of the Hall of Light and Mystery Perfection*. After purifying through fasting and abstaining from grains, he visualized the sun and moon within his mouth—by day the sun, by night the moon—making them as large as rings. The sun was crimson with nine rays of purple light; the moon was yellow with ten rays of white light. He visualized and swallowed the fluids of their radiance, practicing this in secret without count.\"",

      "translated_text": "Should one cease the practice of visualization, let the sun and moon return to dwell within the Hall of Light upon the face—with the sun residing on the left and the moon on the right—so that the two luminaries merge their qi with the pupils of the eyes. This Dao gathers and circulates generative essence, harmonizes the hun-soul and spirit, commands the attendance of the Six Dings, and secures the protection of celestial soldiers. This is the Dao of the Supreme Perfected.\n\nThe *Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious Perfection* must first be sworn to before its practices are undertaken; only afterward may one hear of the Dao of Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings. Formerly, Ji Wei maintained a long fast for three years, devoting himself to single-minded contemplation, and thus attained it. Only then did his divine radiance suffuse his body, and only afterward did he receive the scripture.\n\nThis Dao of Mysterious Perfection is essential yet unburdensome. I have long treasured and concealed it, keeping it close at hand, and now reveal it to you—guard it with utmost secrecy. This is indeed the method that Lord Yu of Xia once received. The Controller of Destinies has now first transmitted this concise and accessible formula to Master Yang, intending that the Prefect practice it. At present, the Prefect’s numinous pool remains turbid, so the matters of the Jade Maidens are temporarily withheld; they shall be revealed later through expedient transmission of the records—this is what is meant by \"proceeding step-by-step in the Mysterious Perfection.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Hall of Light and Mysterious Perfection* exists independently, though its text is brief. The essentials lie in oral instructions, which are precisely as described here. Formerly, Wei did not possess the scripture but practiced according to these instructions and only later obtained it. If you wish to receive it, you may seek it from Wei. The *Hidden Book of Jade Pendants* is not something Wei has seen.\n\nThe scripture referred to is that recorded in the transmission above. When it says, \"If you wish to obtain it,\" it means Master Yang may seek the concise version. The Dao of Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings is a secret of the Eastern Minister; though it shares a category with the Mysterious Perfection and both involve the Way of the Sun and Moon, I mention this lest Master Yang request it from either of the two Lords.\n\nWhen traveling at night or lying in darkness, should fear arise in the heart, visualize the sun and moon returning to the Hall of Light. In an instant, all demonic influences will vanish. It is best to practice this regularly. This visualization is the same as that used when not ingesting the luminous fluids. When dwelling in secluded mountains, if one senses impending trials, it is fitting to constantly visualize to repel them. This formula is separately transmitted in the *Declarations of the Perfected* and is not recorded in the transmission above. Since it pertains to the affairs of the Mysterious Perfection, I have included it here. Those who practice the Dao of the Jade Maidens need not cultivate this, which is why no further commentary is provided.\n\n**Teachings Transmitted by Mao**\nOriginally four matters, now only one is taken.\n\nThe Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate ingests the Four Poles and Cloud-Teeth, ascending as an immortal of the highest realm.\n\nThe female disciple Wei Huacun received the method from the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, consisting of twelve characters with original annotations.\n\nThe Perfected embraces the primordial dawn radiance of the Five Directions and consumes the essence of the Nine Auroras. Thus, his divine radiance shines inwardly, while vermilion splendor manifests outwardly. His body emanates jade-like luster, and his form harmonizes with luminous qi. After practicing for ten years, the Elder of the Central Pole of the Four Extremes descended and united with him. Riding clouds and driving dragons, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe Elders of the Five Directions refer to the spontaneous spirits of the Five Directions, not the constructs of worldly learning. The wonders of ten years’ practice—how swiftly they unfold! Truly, this is the marvelous Dao of empty discourse and the secret method of exhalation and inhalation.\n\nFormerly, the Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate, Master Xiliang, received the oral instructions of the Most High. For a thousand years, it was transmitted five times, never to be recklessly divulged. The statutes of the Four Clarities follow the regulations of the hidden books: a five-day fast is required before transmission, and a covenant is established with the master, pledging five golden rings—one for each direction—as tokens of the oath between heaven and humanity, ensuring secrecy.\n\nThe five-day fast and the five-directional pledge pertain to those still in the world. Formerly, when Lord Wang resided in Huayin, he received the transmission in a single day, fully enlightened. In mountain forests, one maintains a perpetual fast; the oath is a matter of sincere devotion.\n\nAfter transmitting the method of Azure Essence, the Perfected of Xiliang also bestowed this practice, for its principles mutually support the cultivation of the sun, harmonizing emptiness and fullness.\n\n\"Five pairs for the Five Directions\" refers to aligning with the functions of the Five Directions. Alternatively, the Perfected may have called a pair a \"direction,\" hence the oral instructions clarify this—five pairs of rings. Additionally, five ounces of azure silk are used, as per the method of the Perfected of Xiliang. This is the original annotation to the oral instructions, spoken by Lady Wang.\n\nThis original red-inked annotation was written by Master Yang, as dictated by the Lady.\n\nFacing east, knock the teeth nine times and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Azure Teeth of the East, purple clouds streaming with auroras,\nThree Pures meandering, dark frost and jade gauze.\nConsume the morning radiance, drink the dawn’s blossoms.\"*\n(Three rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, lick the outside of the upper lip with the tongue, gather the saliva, and swallow thirty times. With each lick, collect the fluid and swallow once, visualizing the liquid as azure and directing it into the liver. After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Eastern Pole will arrive, bestow upon you the *Azure Perfection*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Azure Perfection* is the name of a scripture.\n\nNext, face south, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Vermilion Cinnabar of the South, auroras illuminating the Great Subtlety,\nNine paths of crimson mist, scattering luminous splendor.\nConsume the numinous dawn, drink from the Cinnabar Pool.\"*\n(Three rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, lick the outside of the lower lip with the tongue, gather the saliva, and swallow thirty times. Visualize the liquid as crimson and direct it into the heart. These two methods both involve licking the fluids from outside the chest, hence the inclusion of the word \"lick.\" After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Southern Pole will arrive in full, bestow upon you the *Cinnabar Radiance*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Cinnabar Radiance* is the name of a scripture.\n\nNext, face west, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Luminous Stone of the West, flying auroras and golden liquid,\nConsume the Great Brightness, the essence of the White Numinous.\nDrink the Jade Nectar, divine splendor awakens the numinous,\nEnabling me to ascend the void, rising to the lofty clarity.\"*\n(Four rhymes.)\n\nThe character *shen* may be a variant of *chen* (dawn).",

After purifying through fasting and abstaining from grains, he visualized the sun and moon within his mouth—by day the sun, by night the moon—making them as large as rings. The sun was crimson with nine rays of purple light; the moon was yellow with ten rays of white light. He visualized and swallowed the fluids of their radiance, practicing this in secret without count.\"",

      "translated_text": "Upon completing the incantation, lick the inside of the upper lip with the tongue, gather the fluids, and swallow the saliva thirty times. Visualize the liquid as white and direct it into the lungs. After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Western Pole will arrive in full, bestow upon you the *Numinous Power of the White Spirit*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Numinous Power of the White Spirit* is the name of six talismans.\n\nNext, face north, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Dark Essence of the North, auspicious clouds stir the embryo,\nGreen auroras spread the dawn, purple canopies and azure banners,\nConsume the radiance of the moon, drink the nectar of jade.\"*\n(Three rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, lick the inside of the lower lip with the tongue, gather the fluids, and swallow the saliva thirty times. Visualize the liquid as dark and direct it into the two kidneys. After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Northern Pole will arrive in full, bestow upon you the *Mysterious Register of Precious Brilliance*, and ascend together with you.\n\n*Mysterious Register of Precious Brilliance* is the name of a scripture.\n\nNext, sit facing south, look upward, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the following yin incantation:\n*\"Primal Essence of Wu and Ji, yellow and white, fivefold clouds,\nFour auroras and purple visions, eight luminaries and nine dawns,\nDual brightness radiates splendor, seven luminaries and numinous lords,\nHarmonize essence and irrigate qi, consume the Central Primal,\nJade radiance and dragon embryo, drink the sweet spring of immortality.\"*\n(Five rhymes.)\n\nUpon completing the incantation, rinse the mouth with saliva until full, swirling it within and without the dark cavity, between teeth and tongue, encompassing all surfaces. Gather the fluids and swallow forty times—this means rinsing once fully before each swallow. Visualize the liquid as yellow and direct it into the spleen. These forty characters were originally written as thirty in the authentic text; later additions were made in clerical script, though the original brushstrokes remain discernible. This method corresponds to the central direction, uniting the four quarters, akin to the meaning of the *Gate of the Quelling Star*.\n\nAfter ten years of practice, the Central Primordial Lady and the Supreme Yellow Elder will descend, bestowing upon you the *Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Hidden Heaven, Concealed Moon, Reclusive Radiance, Record of Chapters, Azure Essentials, and Tiger Script*—ascending together with the Four Elders. This central method encompasses scriptures, talismans, and chapters in three volumes.\n\nThese are the supreme oral instructions of the *Jade Scripture*, the Way of summoning the Five Elders. They enable abstention from grains, elimination of the corpse-worms, rejuvenation of the complexion, immunity to cold and heat, and protection from disasters and harms. The spirit becomes luminous and clear, years are prolonged, and lifespan extended by ten thousand years—an epochal limit. One shall attain the *Ninefold Jade Elixir* and the *Eightfold Flying Essence of Jade*, merging the two ultimate radiant forces to harmonize with heaven and earth. This pertains specifically to the division of *Cloud Teeth*.\n\nAll five yin incantations require knocking the teeth nine times. They may be practiced regularly, not solely at cockcrow or dawn; midnight, seated in quietude within a still chamber, with a tranquil body and serene spirit, is also suitable. Previously, knocking the teeth was only mentioned for the eastern direction, but now it is clarified for all directions. The *Five Peaks* are also named *Bamboo Shoots*, and each direction involves breath-holding.\n\nFor those who cultivate *Guardian Unity*, if they learn this Way, their practice will swiftly come to fruition. With emptiness and tranquility filling the inner self, preserving the primal and swallowing fluids—this is what is called *True Unity*, the self-seeking of abundant blessings. Invoking the spirit through the six fluids and five qi, for the qi is already self-sufficient—hence it is said to be the self-seeking of abundant blessings.\n\nIn practicing this Way, strictly avoid consuming dried meats. If hunger arises, eat wheat-based foods, gradually reducing grain intake, but do not abandon it abruptly in a single day. This is what is meant by *\"diminish and diminish again, until reaching non-action.\"* To practice this grain-abstention is superior even to the *Azure Essence* method, the supreme Way of rejecting grains. However, one must remain in stillness and detachment, free from distractions, and practice diligently over the years to reap the benefits. If one engages in miscellaneous affairs alongside this practice, the body may not endure the strain, failing to achieve the mutual nourishment of internal and external, food and qi. This also depends on the individual’s physical constitution—whether robust or weak, young or old—and cannot be uniformly applied in a single measure.\n\nThough one may have received this method in the past, praised and extolled it, yet ultimately not practiced it, this may be due to their lofty and transcendent vocation. Nevertheless, it is fitting to follow its traces from afar. This is the Way of *Vacuous Reflection*, the method of spontaneity—what is meant by *\"drawing afar from the essence of heaven and earth, and drawing near from one’s own body.\"*\n\n*Cloud Teeth* are the refined qi of the Five Elders, the auroras and mists of the Great Ultimate. Thus, one gathers the radiant essence of their peaks to harmonize the six fluids, penetrating the obscure and evoking response. The numinous and the hidden seek one another, answering without a call. Therefore, when the dragon intones across the ten thousand abysses, radiant clouds descend from the heavens; when the tiger roars upon the sacred mound, the surging winds shake the four directions. The yang burning-mirror summons brightness, and crimson flames arise; the *Fangzhu* vessel captures yin, and dark streams overflow—all occurring naturally, beyond comprehension.\n\nFor the practitioner who dwells in the heart and focuses on the mysterious, delving into the roots of the Dao, impurities are dispelled from the breast, and true correctness resides in the Three Palaces. One gathers the scattered radiance of the five dawns, consumes the auroral nectar of the six sweet springs, invokes the rare treasures of the nine heavens, and utters the secret words of profound wonder. The dragon leaps, emitting radiance, and sevenfold brilliance shines; one savors the threefold flowers upon the white teeth, takes fullness of fluid from the lips’ edge, internally refines the six viscera, and opens clarity and insight. Breathing the primal of heaven, refining the hun and po to transform the body, summoning the dark and causing it to vanish—thus attaining the numinous. After ten tranquil years, the Five Spirits will descend—what need is there for further praise?\n\nThough frail as a woman, I have undertaken the supreme practice of this scripture. My humble voice, a fading echo, cannot be widely proclaimed; I merely recount its wonders to share with like-minded seekers. If one’s cultivation of virtue is insufficient, they ought not be faulted for disparaging it.\n\nRecorded by the Lady of the Southern Peak.\n\nHere concludes the oral instructions transmitted by Wang.\n\nAnnotations irrelevant to immediate practice have been omitted.\n\nThus ends the *Instructions on the Scripture of the Luminous Hall of Primordial Perfection*.",
