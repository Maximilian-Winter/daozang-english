I know it—*\n*I would tell you,*\n*But in the midst of speaking, I forget what I meant.’*\n*Zhi, still unable to ask,*\n*Returned to the Imperial Court,*\n*And questioned the Yellow Emperor.*\n*The Yellow Emperor said:*\n*‘Without thought, without deliberation—*\n*This is how one knows the Dao.*\n*Without dwelling, without attire—*\n*This is how one finds ease in the Dao.*\n*Without path, without method—*\n*This is how one attains the Dao.’*\n*Zhi said to the Yellow Emperor:*\n*‘You and I know this,*\n*Yet that one and that one do not—*\n*Who is correct?’*\n*The Yellow Emperor replied:*\n*‘The Master of Non-Action is truly so,*\n*The Madman Ku only seems so,*\n*You and I shall never approach them.’\"*\n\n*Again, the *Yi Ji* says:*\n*\"The Master said:*\n*‘What need for thought, what need for deliberation?*\n*The world converges yet takes divergent paths,*\n*Unified yet with myriad considerations.*\n*The world’s movement stems from stillness,*\n*The world’s multitude stems from singularity.*\n*Thus, stillness is the root—*\n*Hence, no thought.*\n*Singularity is the master—*\n*Hence, no deliberation.*\n*Yet movement is manifold,*\n*Its paths indeed divergent.*\n*When one awakens to stillness,*\n*Its convergence is the same.*\n*The multitude is restless,*\n*Its considerations myriad.*\n*When one aligns with singularity,*\n*Its focus is unbroken.*\n*Through stillness attaining singularity—*\n*What thought, what deliberation remains?*\n*Thus, the sage governs the world*\n*Without speech, yet all believe,*\n*Without action, yet transformation spreads—*\n*This is how it is attained.’*\n*Hence, Bi Xu says:*\n*‘Without thought, without deliberation,*\n*The heart naturally acts without effort.’*\n*Again, it says:*\n*‘Forgotten merit, forgotten name,*\n*Yet nothing is left undone.’*\n*As the *Zhuangzi·Xiaoyao You* [Carefree Wanderings] says:*\n*‘The Perfect Man has no self,*\n*The Divine Man has no merit,*\n*The Sage has no name—*\n*Thus, it is said:*\n*Forgotten merit, forgotten name,*\n*Yet nothing is left undone.’\"*\n\n*\"The lesser virtue acts,*\n*Yet there is something left undone.\"*\n\n**Refined Notes:**\n*\"The numinous aligns with yin and yang,*\n*The luminous mirrors sun and moon,*\n*The people all revere and obey,*\n*Together rejoicing in its praise,*\n*When the *lin* and *feng* appear,*\n*Auspicious omens come,*\n*Songs and hymns flourish,*\n*And there is something left undone.\"*\n\nThe *Annotations* state:\n\n*\"The *Records of the Former Han* [前汉列传], Chapter Twenty-Eight, says: Public Son Hong (公孙弘), a native of Xie in the state of Mibo (苜川薛人), during the Fifth Year of Emperor Wu’s reign of *Yuan Guang* (元光), was summoned to the *Examination of the Virtuous and the Learned* (征贤良文学对策). Hong replied: ‘I have heard that when *qi* is harmonized, it follows; when sounds resonate, they respond. If the ruler above harmonizes *virtue* and *power* (和德於上), and the people below are in harmony (百姓和合於下), then the heart’s harmony aligns *qi* (心和则气和), *qi*’s harmony aligns the body (气和则形和), the body’s harmony aligns the voice (形和则声和), and when the voice is harmonized, the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and Earth responds in kind (声和则天地之和应矣). Thus, when yin and yang are harmonized, the winds and rains are timely, sweet dew descends, the five grains flourish, the six domestic animals multiply, the fine millet grows, the red grass sprouts, the mountains do not lose their trees, and the marshes do not dry up—this is the utmost harmony (此和之至也). Therefore, when the body is harmonized, there is no illness; without illness, one does not die young; thus, a father does not lose his son, nor a brother mourn his younger brother. When *virtue/power* aligns with Heaven and Earth and its brilliance matches the sun and moon, then the *lin* and *feng* appear, and auspicious omens come: the *river chart* (河图) emerges from the Yellow River, the *turtle script* (洛书) from the Luo River, and distant rulers all bring tribute, praising *Dao/Way* and offering gifts to pay homage (远方之君，莫不说义奉币而来朝). This is the supreme harmony (此和之极也). It further says: ‘When songs and hymns flourish, there is still something left undone’ (歌谣彰而有以为也).*\n\n*The *Mencius·Wàn Zhāng* [万章] states: ‘Shun served as minister to Yao for twenty-eight years—this was not something human strength could achieve; it was *Dao/Way* (天也). When Yao’s death was complete and the three-year mourning concluded, Shun withdrew to the south of the Nan River (南河之南) to avoid Yao’s son. The people of the realm, when they came to pay homage, went not to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who had disputes went not to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who sang their *zhuó* hymns (枢歌) did not sing them to Yao’s son but to Shun. Hence, it is said: *Dao/Way* (天也). Only then did he enter the Central States (中国) and assume the position of the Son of Heaven (践天子位焉). Now, Bi Xu uses this as his argument, saying: ‘The numinous aligns with yin and yang, the luminous mirrors the sun and moon, the people all revere and obey, together rejoicing in its praise, and when the *lin* and *feng* appear, auspicious omens come’—meaning that when songs and hymns flourish, there is still something left undone (歌彰而有以为也). This confirms the response of ‘The lesser *virtue/power* acts, yet there is something left undone’ (下德为之，而有以为).*\n\n*When *rites* (礼) are performed, yet there is no response, then one will roll up one’s sleeves and force it (攘臂而仍之). The *Annotations* state: ‘*Rites* are *walking the Dao/Way* (履).’ It means to walk the Dao/Way and act accordingly, distinguishing between high and low, establishing noble and ignoble. The *Annotations* further say: ‘*Jade and silk* (玉帛) exchanged in tribute.’ The *Annotations* state: ‘As Confucius said in the *Rites of Lu·Yang Huò* [阳货]: ‘*Rites* say *rites*, but where is the jade and silk? *Music* says *music*, but where are the bells and drums?’ It further says: ‘*威仪* (威仪) exchanged in response.’ The *Analects·Zhōng Yōng* [中庸] states: ‘*Rites* encompass three hundred aspects, *威仪* (威仪) three thousand, and in one word: *revere* (无不敬).’ *Rites* are rooted in *reverence*, *music* in *harmony*; when there is awe-inspiring *威* (威), it is called *威*; when there is *仪* (仪) to follow, it is called *仪*. Jade and silk are the material offerings of *rites*, expressing their intent; bells and drums are the instruments of *music*, guiding its *harmony*. Thus, the essence of *rites* and *music* lies in *reverence* and *harmony*, while jade and silk, bells and drums, are their outward forms. Hence, it says: ‘*Jade and silk exchanged in tribute, awe-inspiring forms in response, raising hands and bowing, advancing and retreating with respectful glances* (玉帛交驰，威仪相答，擎跽曲拳，进退顾揖)—these are the *rites*’ outward flourishes (此礼之文也).’ Therefore, it is said: ‘This is their superficiality (故云末焉).’ If, however, they are exchanged and responded to yet there is no reciprocation, then it will escalate to rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing it (则至於攘臂而仍之也).*\n\n*The *Annotations* state: ‘Confucius said: The greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms (大礼与天地同节).’ This is from the *Records of Rites·Yue Ji* [乐记]. It says: ‘The greatest *music* aligns with Heaven and Earth’s *harmony*, the greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms. *Harmony* ensures all things flourish without harm, and *rhythm* clarifies the offerings to Heaven and Earth, the bright world of *rites* and *music*, and the hidden realm of *ghosts and spirits* (幽则有鬼神).’ The original *Annotations* mistakenly attributed this to *Zhuangzi*, but this is corrected now. It further says: ‘Taking *rites* as wings (以礼为翼), so as to act in the world (所以行於世也者).’ This is from the *Zhuangzi·Dà Zōng Shī* [大宗师]. Having already stated that the greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms, and now taking them as wings to act in the world, how could there ever be the chaos of rolling up one’s sleeves? *Rites*, indeed, are the thinnest expression of *loyalty and trustworthiness* (忠信), yet they are the origin of disorder (而乱之首).*\n\n*The *Annotations* state: ‘*Zhuangzi* said: The Perfect Man practices the *teachings of the Dao/Way* without words (圣人行不言之教云).’ It says: ‘Is it not only the *Great Person* (大人) who does so?’ The *Annotations* state: This is from the *Zhuangzi·Knowing the North* [知北游]. The *Annotations*’ text has already been fully explained, so there is no need to repeat it. In essence, it confirms that *rites* are the outward adornment of the Dao/Way, yet they are the origin of disorder.*\n\n*The *Annotations* further state: ‘*Virtue/Power* (德), *harmony* (和) also, is the utmost *trustworthiness* in action, bearing, and form, aligning with *rites* (顺乎文), which is the *rites* (礼).’ This is from the *Zhuangzi·Refining One’s Nature* [缮性]. The *Annotations*’ text is already complete, so it need not be repeated again. Thus, Bi Xu takes these passages from the *Southern Flowering* (南华) to confirm his arguments, showing that the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi on *virtue/power*, *Dao/Way*, *benevolence and righteousness*, *rites and music*, and *loyalty and trustworthiness* are never disregarded, but rather their proper order and hierarchy are clarified.*\n\n*‘Prior recognition is the Dao/Way’s outward adornment, yet it is the beginning of folly (前识者，道之华，而愚之始).’ The *Annotations* state: ‘Using wisdom to govern the state makes it a thief (以智治国，国之贼).’ This is from the *Sixth Chapter* of the *Classic*. It has already been clarified in this section.*\n\n*The *Annotations* further state: ‘*无思无虑* (No thought, no deliberation)’—this is the language of the *Easy System* (易系). It has already been fully explained earlier.*\n\n*The *Annotations* state: ‘*Excessive rites lead to disorder* (礼烦则乱).’ As the upper text refers to the *Book of Documents·Shuō Mìng* [说命中]: ‘Only in the *Shuō Mìng* did the Hundred Officials gather, and then they presented themselves to the King, saying: ‘Ah! The enlightened ruler follows Heaven’s *Dao/Way* (天道), establishes states and sets up capitals. If he has goodness, he loses his goodness. If he values ability, he loses his *power* (功).’’*\n\n「Only when all matters are attended to with preparation does one have no calamity.\nDo not provoke favor nor invite humiliation,\nDo not shamefully commit faults or act wrongly.\nOnly in their proper place does governance become pure.\nExcessive offerings in sacrifice are called *pí* (pittance), yet they are said to lack reverence.\nWhen rites become elaborate, chaos ensues;\nWhen worship becomes excessive, difficulties arise.\nFrequent sacrifices to the *qí* (cypress) tree are undesirable—\nFrequent offerings lead to *pí* (pittance),\n*Pí* (pittance) leads to disrespect,\nExcessive worship and elaborate rites\nBring disorder and become difficult to uphold.\n\nThe King said: \"Profound, Say!\"\nThen he spoke of *fú* (proper conduct).\nSay bowed and knelt, saying: \"It is not difficult to know—\nIt is difficult to act.\nThe sincerity of the *Róng* clan is not difficult,\nBut it harmonizes with the accomplished *virtue* of the former kings.\nSay did not speak of his own merit.\n\nNow, *Bìqū* again takes this to govern the state with *smartness*—\nA thief to the state—\nTo verify and resolve earlier insights.\nThe *flowering* of the *Dao/Way* lies in *smartness* existing in human consciousness before it.\nYet when *smartness* shifts to deceit and elaborate rites bring chaos,\nIs this not the *flowering* of the *Dao/Way* and the beginning of folly?\n\nHow could it compare to concealing *smartness*, concealing consciousness,\nHaving no thought, no deliberation,\nAnd returning to substance and reality?\n\nThus, the *great man* dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nResides in reality, not in ornamentation—\nHence, he abandons the latter and takes the former.\n\n*The Annotations* state: \"The *great man* is a vigorous, pure, and *Dao*-aligned scholar.\"\n*The Commentary* says: \"Vigorous and pure\" is from the *Yì·Guàn* [乾卦文言]:\n\"Vigorous, pure, and precise\"—\nSpeaking of the *great man* inheriting this vigorous, pure *qi* at birth,\nThus becoming a *Dao*-aligned scholar.\nAble to abandon the superficiality of rites and *smartness*,\nAnd take the substance of *virtue* and *power*,\nThis can be called fortifying the root and discarding the branches.\nHence, \"abandon the latter and take the former.\"\n\n*The Annotations* quote *Wénzǐ* as saying:\n\"The *great man* is serene without thought,\nIndifferent without deliberation,\nWalks where there is no path,\nRoams without weariness,\nExits without doors,\nEnters without rooms,\nFocuses his spirit,\nLays down his perceptions,\nVacant and without action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\"\n\n*The Commentary* says: This is from *Wénzǐ·Dàoyuán* [道原篇]:\n\"Lǎozǐ said: The *great man* refers to one who embodies the *Dao*.\nSerene without thought, indifferent without deliberation,\nTakes Heaven as his canopy,\nEarth as his carriage,\nThe Four Seasons as his horses,\nYin and Yang as his duties.\nWalks where there is no path,\nRoams without weariness,\nExits without doors,\nEnters without rooms.\nTaking Heaven as his canopy, nothing remains uncovered.\nTaking Earth as his carriage, nothing remains unborne.\nThe Four Seasons as horses, nothing remains unmoved.\nYin and Yang govern it, nothing remains unprepared.\nThus, the sage internally cultivates his root,\nExternally adorns his branches,\nFocuses his spirit—\n*Shū* (gather), *zhú* (candle)—\nThis is concentration.\nLays down his perceptions,\nThus, vacant and without action, yet nothing remains undone,\nWithout governance, yet nothing remains ungoverned.\nWhat is called *wuwei* (non-action) is not acting before things.\nWhat is called *wu zhì* (non-governance) is not altering nature.\nWhat is called *wu bù zhì* (nothing remains ungoverned) is following things as they naturally are.\nThus, *Bìqū* takes this to verify and resolve\nThe *great man* dwelling in substance, not in superficiality.\n\nFrom *Xīzhī Déyī* [昔之得一], Chapter Thirty-Nine:\n*Xīzhī Déyī*—\nHeaven obtains *yī* (One), thus it is clear;\nEarth obtains *yī* (One), thus it is tranquil;\nThe *shén* (spirit) obtains *yī* (One), thus it is responsive;\nThe *gǔ* (valley) obtains *yī* (One), thus it is full;\nAll things obtain *yī* (One), thus they flourish;\nThe feudal lords and kings obtain *yī* (One), thus they become the standard for all under Heaven.\nThis is how *yī* (One) is attained.\n\n*The Commentary* says: *Yī* (One) is the child of the *Dao*,\nThe subtle and harmonious *qi*.\nIt is the origin of yin and yang,\nThe mother of all things.\nWhen applied and utilized,\nIt ascends as clouds,\nDescends as rain,\nScatters as wind,\nStrikes as thunder—\nWhen striking with radiance, it becomes lightning.\nUnchanging from ancient times to now,\nEndless from beginning to end—\n*Yī* (One), its greatness is vast!\n\n*The Annotations* state: \"In yin, it shares the same *virtue*;\nIn yang, it shares the same waves.\"\n*The Commentary* says: This is from *Zhuāngzǐ·Kèyì* [刻意篇].\nAlready detailed in the *Dàojīng* [道经].\n\nAgain, it says: \"Dwelling in tiles and bricks without defilement\"—\nThis is from *Zhuāngzǐ·Zhī Běiyóu* [知北游].\nAlready fully explained in Chapter Thirty-Two.\nThis speaks of the *Dao*’s *qi* being everywhere.\n\n*The Annotations* state: \"Motionless and still, it is called the True Sovereign;\nControlling the form, it is called the True Ruler.\"\n*The Commentary* says: \"Motionless and still\" is from the *Yì* system:\n\"Motionless and still, yet responsive and thus communicating with all under Heaven.\"\nAgain, \"True Sovereign, True Ruler\" is from *Zhuāngzǐ·Qíwùlùn* [齐物论]:\n\"Not this without me, not me without this.\nThis is also close.\nYet one does not know what it employs.\nIf there is a True Ruler,\nYet one does not obtain its traces,\nOne can act in faith without seeing its form,\nHaving emotion without form.\nA hundred limbs, nine orifices, six viscera—\nAll are encompassed and preserved within.\nWith whom shall I be intimate?\nYou all agree with this, do you not?\nYet there is still private inclination within it.\"\n\n「If this is so, then all are merely subjects and servants, are they not?\nTheir subjects and servants are insufficient to govern them.\nThus, they alternately become sovereigns and subjects.\nYet there is a True Sovereign within them.\n\nWhether one attains its essence or fails to do so,\nIt brings no gain nor loss to its authenticity.\n\n*The Compilation* further cites the *Sūtra of the Western Ascension* [西升经]:\n\"When you obtain the One, all affairs are accomplished\"—\nThis has already been explained in the previous passages.\n\n*The Compilation* states: *Zhuāngzǐ* says:\n\"Qi is that which is empty and yet awaits all things.\"\nOnly the Dao gathers this emptiness.\nEmptiness, then, is the essence of *heart-fasting* [心斋].\n\nAgain, it says:\n\"Within the empty hall, purity arises;\nIn stillness, auspiciousness abides.\"\n*The Commentary* notes: These lines are from *Zhuāngzǐ·Rénjiānshì* [庄子·人间世].\n\nYán Huí [颜回] asked Confucius:\n\"Master, my home is poor,\nYet for months I have neither drunk wine nor eaten *ru* [如] meat.\"\nIf this is so, can it be considered *heart-fasting*?\n\nConfucius replied:\n\"This is the *heart-fasting* of sacrifices,\nNot the *heart-fasting* of the heart.\"\nYán Huí asked:\n\"May I inquire about *heart-fasting* of the heart?\"\n\nZhōngní [仲尼] said:\n\"If your will is unified,\nDo not listen with your ears but with your heart,\nNor listen with your heart but with your *qi* [气].\nLet listening cease at the ears,\nAnd let your heart cease at its *symbols* [符].\n*Qi* is that which is empty and yet awaits all things.\nOnly the Dao gathers this emptiness—\nEmptiness is the *heart-fasting* of the heart.\"\n\nYán Huí said:\n\"Before I attained this *use* [使],\nIt was truly from myself alone.\nWhen I attained this *use*,\nI no longer had myself.\nCan this be called emptiness?\"\n\nThe Master [夫子] said:\n\"Exhausted indeed!\nObserve the *unfilled* [阙]:\nWithin the empty hall, purity arises;\nIn stillness, auspiciousness abides.\nYet it does not remain still—\nThis is called *sitting while galloping* [坐驰].\nWhat is sought and verified,\nIs nothing more than this.\"\n\n*The Compilation* further states: \"All things derive their origin\"—\nThis is from the *Yì·Qián* [易·乾卦] *Simu* [彖辞]:\n\"Great indeed is the *Qián* [乾] origin!\nAll things derive their origin from it.\"\n\nAgain, it says: \"All things derive their life\"—\nThis is also from the *Yì·Kūn* [易·坤卦] *Simu* [彖]:\n\"Extreme indeed is the *Kūn* [坤] origin!\nAll things derive their life from it.\n*Kūn* [坤] is vast and bears all things,\nIts virtue harmonizes without bounds.\"\n\n*The Compilation* further states: \"The *Spirit* [神] is that which subtly manifests all things as its words\"—\nThis is from the *Yì·Shuō* [易·说卦] text,\nAlready explained in previous passages.\n\nNow, *Bìqū* [碧虚] takes these several passages\nTo verify the reasoning of *obtaining the One* [得一].\n\nThe so-called *One* [一] is the *original qi* [元气].\nThis *original qi* can be both *yin* [阴] and *yang* [阳],\nYet it does not belong to either *yin* or *yang*.\nIt ascends to the *Jīng* [京] of Jade and the *Gold Gate* [金阙],\nYet it is not taken as *clear* [清].\nIt dwells in the *cracked earth* [瓦号] of *Lì* [荔] and *Suì* [薜],\nYet it is not taken as *impure* [浊].\n\nThe *Qián* [乾] origin uses it to derive its beginning,\nThe *Kūn* [坤] origin uses it to derive its life.\nWhen it governs and controls the *manifested* [有为],\nThen the True Sovereign emerges.\nWhen it is motionless and still,\nThen the True Sovereign appears.\n\nBy its utmost emptiness, it becomes the root of all life;\nBy its utmost fewness, it becomes the ancestor of all things.\nThose who attain this:\nNothing fails to be born,\nNo affair fails to be accomplished,\nThus it is said: *Heaven obtains the One to remain clear* [天得一以清].\n\n*The Compilation* states:\nEven the *feudal lords and kings* [侯王], attaining this,\nAre able to perpetually possess the *Great Treasure* [大宝],\nWithout thought, all submit.\nThus they bring peace and rectitude to the world.\n\n*The Commentary* notes: \"Without thought, all submit\"—\nThis is from the *Máo Shī* [毛诗] *Dàyǎ·Wénwángyǒushēngpiān* [大雅·文王有声篇]:\n\"Hào [镐] and Jīng [京] were divided and settled,\nFrom the west to the east,\nFrom the south to the north,\nWithout thought, all submit—\nGreat King, your virtue is indeed vast!\"\n\nIt says: \"Great King, your virtue is indeed vast!\"\n*Huáng* [皇] means *great* [大],\n*Zhēng* [烝] means *sovereign* [君].\nThis praises Wǔwáng [武王] for his great virtue and sovereign power.\n\nNow *Bìqū* cites this to say:\nThat when Wǔwáng [武王] performed the *pìyōng* [辟雍] rites at Hào [镐] and Jīng [京],\nHe inspired awe and submission from all four directions,\nAll nations fearing and yielding—\nThis was also due to his attainment of the One and its rectification.\n\nThus it is said: *Feudal lords and kings obtain the One to rectify the world* [侯王得一以为天下正].\n\nHeaven, without its *clearness* [清], would fear *cleavage* [裂];\nEarth, without its *tranquility* [宁], would fear *upheaval* [发];\nThe *Spirit* [神], without its *responsiveness* [灵], would fear *extinction* [歇];\nThe *valleys* [谷], without their *fullness* [盈], would fear *exhaustion* [竭];\nAll things, without their *life* [生], would fear *annihilation* [灭];\nFeudal lords and kings, without *uprightness* [贞] and *nobility* [贵高], would fear *overthrow* [蹶].\n\nThus, *nobility* is rooted in *humility* [贱],\nAnd *height* is based on *lowliness* [基].\nHence, feudal lords and kings call themselves *orphan* [孤],\n*widower* [寡], and *not-grain* [不谷]—\nThis is their way of taking *humility* as the root,\nIs it not?\n\n*The Compilation* states: \"When *yin* and *yang* are disordered.\"\n*The Commentary* notes: This is from the *Wénzǐ·Shànglǐ* [文子·上礼] text:\n\"When *yin* and *yang* are disordered,\nThe four seasons lose their sequence,\nThunder and lightning are destroyed and broken,\nFrost and hail bring harm,\nAnd all things wither and perish.\nThe full passage has already been recorded in the *Dàodéjīng* [道经], the thirty-first chapter, in detail.\n\nAgain, it says: \"Yet the *Spirit* [神] is the *yin* and *yang* that cannot be measured\"—\nThis has also been explained in previous passages.\n\n*The Compilation* states:\nThus, the *drying up of the Luo* [锥] led to the decline of Xià [夏],\nAnd the *drying up of the Hé* [河] caused the fall of Shāng [商].\n\n*The Commentary* notes: The *Shǐjì·Zhōuběnjì* [史记·周本纪] states:\n\"In the second year of Yōuwáng [幽王], the three rivers of the Western Zhou [西周] all trembled.\nThe Western Zhou refers to Hào [镐] and Jīng [京].\nThe three rivers are the *Jīng* [泾], *Wèi* [渭], and *Luo* [洛].\nBóyángfǔ [伯阳父] said: 'The Zhou shall perish.'\nBóyángfǔ was the aged *Zhūxiàshǐ* [柱下史] Laozi of the Zhou.\n\nThe *qi* of Heaven and Earth does not lose its order.\nIf it exceeds its order, the people will be in chaos.\nWhen *yang* is suppressed and cannot emerge,\nAnd *yin* is oppressed and cannot nourish,\nThen there is an earthquake.\nNow the three rivers truly trembled—\nThis is *yang* losing its place and subduing *yin*.\nWhen *yang* is lost within *yin*,\nThe *source* [原] must be blocked,\nAnd when the *source* is blocked, the state must perish.\n\nThe water and soil nourish the people,\n*Nourishment* [演] being *moistening* [润].\nWhen the soil lacks nourishment,\nThe people lack resources,\nWhat more awaits them than ruin?\n\nIn the past, when the *Luo* [伊洛] dried up, Xià [夏] perished.\nYǔ [禹] settled at *Yángchéng* [阳城],\nNear the *Luo* [伊洛].\nWhen the *Hé* [河] dried up, Shāng [商] perished.\nThe Shāng people settled at *Wèi* [卫],\nWhere the *Hé* [河] flowed.\"\n\nNow the **Zhōu** [周] **virtue/power** [德] is like that of the last rulers of the two former dynasties. Its river sources are again blocked, and when blocked, they will dry up.\n\nA state must depend on mountains and rivers,\nFor when mountains collapse and rivers dry up,\nThis is the sign of a fallen state.\nWhen rivers dry up, mountains must collapse—\nIf a state falls, it will not exceed ten years,\nThis is the measure of **fate** [数].\n\nWhat the **Heaven** [天] abandons does not exceed its measure.\nIn this year, the three rivers dried up,\nAnd the **Qí** [岐] Mountain collapsed.\nIn the third year, **Yōu Wáng** [幽王] favored **Bào Sì** [褒姒],\nThe **Shēn** [申] Lord journeyed westward to the **Xīyí** [西夷],\nAnd the **Quǎn Róng** [犬戎] killed **Yōu Wáng** [幽王],\nTruly fulfilling the sign of a fallen state.\n\nThe **Shēn** [申] Lord was the father of **Shēn Hòu** [申后].\n**Shēn Hòu** [申后] was **Yōu Wáng**’s [幽王] consort.\nFavoring **Sì** [姒] and abandoning **Shēn Hòu** [申后],\nThis was the cause of the **Shēn** [申] Lord’s anger.\n\nThus **Bì Qū** [碧虚] cited it to illustrate his point,\nSaying: *\"When the **Zhuī** [锥] (river) dried up, Xià [夏] perished,\nAnd when the **Hé** [河] dried up, Shāng [商] was lost,\"*\nTo prove that **grain** [谷] cannot overflow its measure,\nAnd to warn of the danger of depletion.\n\n**Zhuǎn** [纂] further states:\n*\"The humble guard themselves with moderation.\"*\n**Zhuó** [钞] says:\n*\"This refers to the *Yì·Jiān* [易·谦卦] Hexagram, Line Six: 'Humble words, humble deeds.'\"*\nIt has already been detailed in Chapter Fifteen of the *Dào Jīng* [道经].\nThe preceding passages **Bì Qū** [碧虚] took to prove,\nAnd to elucidate the principle of **\"One\"** [一].\n\nIf one loses this principle,\nThen one invites the calamities of **cracking** [裂], **bursting** [发], **diminishing** [歇], **drying up** [竭], **extinction** [灭], and **collapse** [蹶].\n\nThus, to receive many praises without encouragement,\nAnd to face many criticisms without discouragement—\nThis is the **Dao/Way** [道] of guarding the **\"Uncarved\"** [冲] **\"One\"** [一].\n\n**Zhuǎn** [纂] states:\n*\"The world praises much but does not increase virtue,\nAnd the world criticizes much but does not hinder it.\"*\n**Zhuó** [钞] says:\n*\"The preceding text, *Zhuāngzǐ·Xiāoyáo Yóu* [庄子·逍遥游], states:\n'Thus, the wise man serves one official,\nActs in accordance with one village,\nGains the harmony of one lord,\nAnd conquers one state—\nYet in his own estimation, he is no different from this.'\n\nYet **Róngzǐ** [荣子] of **Sòng** [宋] still scoffs at it.\nIf the whole world praises you yet you do not increase virtue,\nAnd if the whole world criticizes you yet you do not falter—\nWhen you have firmly distinguished the divisions of inner and outer,\nAnd clearly discerned the boundaries of honor and dishonor,\nThen you have achieved it.\n\nThus **Bì Qū** [碧虚] cited it to illustrate his point,\nSaying: 'The world praises much yet does not increase virtue,\nAnd the world criticizes much yet does not hinder it—\nHow does one know what is truly honored?\nHow does one know what is truly dishonored?'\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way** [道] of forgetting honor and dishonor,\nYet able to preserve the **\"Uncarved\"** [冲] **\"One\"** [一],\nAnd to establish it as the **correct order** [正] of the world.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Reversed (反者道之动)**\n**Zhuǎn** [纂] states:\n*\"The *Yì·Fù* [易·复卦] Hexagram says: 'The strong reverse.'*\nMoving yet proceeding with gentleness,\nThus there is no harm in coming and going.\n\n**Zhuó** [钞] says:\n*\"This is the *Yì·Fù* [易·复卦] **Hexagram Commentary** [彖辞].\n'Fù' [复], **success** [亨].\nThe strong reverse,\nMoving yet proceeding with gentleness,\nThus there is no harm in coming and going,\nAnd friends come without blame.\n\nFollowing its **Dao/Way** [道], in seven days it returns.\nThis is the **Heavenly movement** [天行].\n'It is beneficial to have a place of return,'\nFor the strong are long-lasting.\n'Fù' [复] reveals the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地].\n\nThis is the time when **One** [一] **yang** [阳] first emerges.\n\n**Bào Jí** [鲍极] **Jié** [解] says:\n'The foundation of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地] lies in the **Original One** [一元].\nThe **qi** [气] of the **Original One** [一元] resides within **Kǎn** [坎].\nBelow, it corresponds to the **Huángzhōng** [黄锺] **palace** [宫],\nAbove, it ascends to the **Qiánniú** [牵牛] **constellation** [宿],\nAnd in the middle, it contains the **Tàijí** [太极] **radiance** [熙].\n\nIts **substance** [体] is **stillness** [静],\nIts **function** [用] is **movement** [动],\nThus it can govern the four seasons,\nAnd transform and nourish all things—\nThis is the reason why it is said to be **serene yet unmoving** [寂然不动],\nYet **responsive** [感] and **penetrating** [遂] to all under **Heaven** [天].\n\nWhen **movement** [动] ceases, it becomes **stillness** [静],\nAnd when **stillness** [静] is restored, it returns to its **Original One** [元].\nThis occurs in the **Jiànzǐ** [建子] **month** [月], when the **Three** [三] is contained within **One** [一].\n\nWhen **stillness** [静] ceases, it becomes **movement** [动],\nAnd when **movement** [动] is displayed, its **function** [用] is revealed.\nThe **end** [终] returns to the **beginning** [始],\nAnd **generation** [生] continues without limit—\nThe **Dao/Way** [道] is found within this.\n\nWhen **One** [一] is central, it endures long,\nAnd when it endures long, it changes.\nThus, through **movement** [动] we perceive **stillness** [静],\nAnd through **function** [用] we perceive **substance** [体].\nThis means that **substance** [体] is not merely **stillness** [静],\nFor it is categorized by **movement** [动],\nYet its **stillness** [静] is seen.\n\n**Stillness** [静] is the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地].\nThus the **sage** [圣人] embodies the **Original One** [元]\nTo establish their **sincerity** [诚],\nWith **stillness** [静] as their **nature** [性],\nAnd with **movement** [动] as their **transformation** [化],\nSo they do not exert themselves yet achieve harmony,\nNor think yet attain understanding,\nAnd thus align with **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地] in their **virtue/power** [德].\n\nThose who can **shape** [造] form and **awaken** [悟]\nYet seek to return to the **Original One** [元] are **accomplished** [贤].\nThus, the **Original One** [元] is the foundation of the **sage** [圣],\nAnd the **return** [复] is the foundation of the **accomplished** [贤],\nYet the **initial nine** [初九] of the *Yì* [易] was grasped by **Yán Shì** [颜氏].\n\n**Yán Shì** [颜氏] grasped it,\nFor the *Yì·Xià* [易下击] states:\n*\"The noble man knows the subtle and the manifest,\nKnows softness and knows strength—\nThis is the hope of ten thousand men.\"*\n\nThe **Master** [子] said:\n*\"Yán Shì’s [颜氏] son nearly approaches this ideal.\"*\nThere is no evil he has not known,\nYet knowing it, he has never repeated it.\n\nThe *Yì* [易] states:\n*\"No distant return without blame,\n**Original** [元] **success** [吉]—\nThis is what it means.\"*\n\nThus **\"return\"** [复] is not the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地],\nBut rather the ability to perceive it.\n\n**Zhū Huì’ān** [朱晦庵] said:\n*\"Under accumulated **yin** [阴], **One** [一] **yang** [阳] emerges to return,\nRevealing the **heart** [心] of **generation** [生]—\nIn humans, this is **stillness** [静] reaching its peak and then **movement** [动],\nAnd **evil** [恶] reaching its peak and then **good** [善].\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Weak (弱者道之用)**\n**Zhuǎn** [纂] states:\n*\"Softness and weakness, along with **feminine stillness** [雌静],\nAre truly the **functions** [用] of the **Dao/Way** [道].\"*\n\n**Zhuó** [钞] says:\n*\"This clarifies the **true teaching** [实教].\nIt speaks of softness, weakness, and humility,\nAs the means to enter the **Dao/Way** [道].\"*\n\nWhy so?\nThe *Lièzǐ·Huángdì Piān* [列子·黄帝篇] states:\n*\"There is a **constant victorious Dao/Way** [常胜之道] under **Heaven** [天],\nAnd there is a **non-constant victorious Dao/Way** [不常胜之道] under **Heaven** [天].\"*\nThis text has already been detailed in Chapter Thirty-Three.\n\nFrom this perspective,\nIs it not clear that the **weak** [弱] are the **functions** [用] of the **Dao/Way** [道]?\n\nThus, it is known that the earlier passages explained the **flexibility** [权] of the **Dao/Way** [道],\nAnd these passages elucidate its **truth** [实].\n\n**Flexibility** [权] reverses the **classics** [经] yet aligns with the **Dao/Way** [道],\n**Truth** [实] is **sincerity** [真诚] without falsity.\n**Flexibility** [权] aids **truth** [实],\nAnd **truth** [实] implements **flexibility** [权].\n**Flexibility** [权] and **truth** [实] mutually rely on each other,\nAnd neither can be neglected.\n\nObserving the interpretation in *Guǎng Shèng Yì* [广圣义],\nIt states: *\"The **Dao/Way** [道] first manifests in softness and weakness,\nYet the world values strength and rigidity.\nSoftness and weakness are the means to preserve life,\nWhile strength and rigidity are the roots of defeat.\"*\n\nThis **classic** [经] states:\n*\"The strong and rigid do not meet their end,\nAnd I shall use them as my **teachers** [教父].\"*\n\nGuided by this principle to instruct the world,\nLet all abandon rigidity and embrace flexibility,\nLet all abandon agitation and return to stillness.\n\nTeaching has two paths—**flexibility** [权] and **truth** [实].\nThe superior adept comprehends sincerity,\nThus they are taught with **truth** [实],\nAnd naturally align with the Dao/Way in profound accord.\n\nThe moderately wise and the lowly are awakened through **flexibility** [权].\nIf they remain unenlightened, then they are lured by **benevolent guidance** [善道].\nIf they refuse to follow, then they are encouraged by rewards and favors.\nIf they still refuse, then they are regulated by laws and decrees.\nIf they still refuse, then they are compelled by penalties and statutes.\nIf they still refuse, then they are subjected to punishments—\nThe five punishments: branding, nasal amputation, castration, exile, and execution.\n\n*Do not carve the sound of the bell lightly.*\n\nThe Sage employs punishments as a last resort—\nCould they have done otherwise?\n*The Book of Documents* says: *\"Punishments seek to eliminate punishments.\"*\n*Seek* means to strive.\nThe Sage, through **flexibility** [权], establishes punishments,\nSeeking only that people refrain from crime,\nNot desiring to inflict punishment upon them.\n\n*The Guang Sheng Yi* cites *The Book of Documents*:\n*\"When deeds are in doubt, weigh them heavily;\nWhen guilt is in doubt, weigh it lightly.\nThough punishments are set by **flexibility** [权],\nThey serve to restrain and encourage the people.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s compassionate governance and love for life are indeed profound.\nOnly when exhortation fails do punishments come into play.\n\nThus, punishments make the people fearful,\nRewards make them eager.\nEagerness drives them toward virtue,\nFear deters them from vice.\nThough punishments may befall some,\nIt is for their own good.\nAnd by punishing one, a hundred are deterred—\nThus, few are punished while many follow virtue.\n\nLike combing hair,\nIf you comb it once every ten days, most will abandon it.\nBut if you comb it daily, most will keep it orderly.\n\n「Thus, those who understand the **Dao of flexibility** [权道]—\nWhen the sovereign applies it well, it becomes the art of ruling from the throne.\nWhen the common scholar or layperson applies it well, it becomes the method of aligning with the Dao.\nBut if the sovereign or the common scholar and layperson do not apply it well,\nIt becomes a source of calamity instead.\nIs this not something to be cautious about?\n\nIf one can return and reflect upon the origin of **emptiness and tranquility** [虚静],\nAnd transcend the realm of being and non-being [有无],\nThen strength and weakness are both forgotten,\nAnd the distinction between **flexibility** [权] and reality [实] vanishes.\nWhy would one then resort to the Dao of punishments and rewards to restrain and encourage?\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"The reverse is the movement of the Dao,\nThe weak is the application of the Dao.\"*\n\nAll things under heaven arise from **being** [有],\nAnd **being** arises from **non-being** [无].\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*The Liezi* states:\n*\"The Liezi·Tianrui Chapter* [《列子·天瑞篇》] says:\nMaster Liezi said:\n'Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to govern heaven and earth.\nThings with form arise from the formless—\nHow then did heaven and earth come into existence?'\n\nThus it is said:\nThere is **Primordial Simplicity** [太易],\nThere is **Primordial Beginning** [太初],\nThere is **Primordial Commencement** [太始],\nThere is **Primordial Substance** [太素].\n**Primordial Simplicity** [太易] is before **qi** [气] appears.\n**Primordial Beginning** [太初] is the beginning of **qi** [气].\n**Primordial Commencement** [太始] is the beginning of form.\n**Primordial Substance** [太素] is the beginning of essence [质].\nWhen **qi**, form, and essence are present yet not yet separated,\nIt is called **indistinct unity** [浑沦].\n**Indistinct unity** [浑沦] refers to the state where all things remain undifferentiated yet not yet distinct.\n\nIt cannot be seen,\nIt cannot be heard,\nIt cannot be grasped by following—\nThus it is called **Simplicity** [易].\n**Simplicity** [易] is formless and good;\n**Simplicity** changes into **Oneness** [一],\n**Oneness** changes into **Sevenfold** [七],\n**Sevenfold** changes into **Ninefold** [九],\n**Ninefold** is the ultimate transformation—\nThen it returns to change once more into **Oneness** [一],\n**Oneness** being the beginning of form’s transformation.\n\nThe light and clear **qi** ascends to become the heavens,\nThe heavy and turbid **qi** descends to become the earth,\nThe harmonious **qi** [冲和气] becomes the human.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Heaven and earth contain the essence [精],\nAnd all things are transformed and generated.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] further says:\n*\"When form moves, it does not generate form,\nBut generates shadow [影].\nWhen sound moves, it does not generate sound,\nBut generates echo [响].\nWhen the void moves, it does not generate the void,\nBut generates being [有].\"*\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"This passage is also from the *Liezi·Tianrui Chapter* [《列子·天瑞篇》],\nQuoting the *Yellow Emperor’s Book* [《黄帝书》]:*\n*'Form’s movement does not generate form,\nBut generates shadow [影].\nSound’s movement does not generate sound,\nBut generates echo [响].\nThe void’s movement does not generate the void,\nBut generates being [有].\"*\n\nForm is the end,\nAnd heaven and earth end with me and my end,\nAdvancing into the unknown [终进乎不知].\n\nNow, the *Bìxū* [碧虚] takes this to illustrate:\nIt proves the meaning that all things under heaven arise from **being** [有],\nAnd **being** arises from **non-being** [无].\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Scholar Hears the Dao**\n\nThe superior scholar hears the Dao,\nAnd diligently practices it.\nThe middle scholar hears the Dao,\nAnd regards it as if it exists, yet as if it does not.\nThe inferior scholar hears the Dao,\nAnd laughs at it in derision.\nIf it is not laughed at,\nIt is not worthy to be called the Dao.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"The superior scholar is of pure nature,\nTranquil and still,\nSerene and unperturbed,\nVoid and without action.\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*'This is from the *Zhuangzi·Kèyì Chapter* [《庄子·刻意篇》].\nAlready mentioned in the opening, so no need to repeat it here.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"Pure and unmixed,\nStable in **Oneness** [一] yet unchanging,\nGentle and without contrivance,\nActing yet following the natural course of heaven—\nThis is the Dao of nurturing the spirit [神].\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"This is what is called **naturally released bonds** [天然县解].*\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"The *Zhuangzi·Yǎngshēngzhǔ Chapter* [《庄子·养生主篇》] says:\nWhen the Master Laozi died,\nQin Xi, a disciple of the lost teachings, went to mourn him.\nHe wept three times and then left.\nHis disciples asked:\n'Was he not your master’s friend?'\nHe replied:\n'Yes.'\"\n\nThen is such mourning as this acceptable?\n\nHe replied: *\"Indeed. At first, I thought him a man of worth, but now I see he was not. When I entered to mourn him, an elder wept as if for his own son, and a younger as if for his own mother. Their grief was not feigned—no stifled sobs, no forced tears. This was contrived mourning, betraying the truth, forgetting what they had received. The ancients called this *duàn tiān* [遁天]—a crime against heaven.\n\nTo arrive at his time was proper; to depart at his time was natural.\nTo dwell in the proper time and follow what is natural—\ngrief and joy cannot touch such a one.\nThe ancients called this *imperial release* [帝之县解].\nThus it is said: This is what is called **naturally released bonds** [天然县解].\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"The **middle-ranking scholar** [中士] receives a nature of moderation. The *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*'Moderation'* refers to possessing **steady virtue** [中常之德].\nThe *Rites of Zhou* [《礼记》] has a chapter titled *The Doctrine of the Mean* [《中庸》], which expounds on the virtue of harmony and balance.\nAgain, in the *Analects of Confucius·Yǒngyě Chapter* [《论语·雍也篇》], Confucius says:\n*'The virtue of moderation—how long has it been absent from the people!'\nIf one’s innate nature inherently possesses this virtue of moderation, then he may be called a **middle-ranking scholar**.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"If such a moderate scholar is not employed by the world, he will seek the marshes and wilds, dwell in secluded places, exhale the stale and inhale the fresh, striving only for cultivation.\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\nThis is from the *Zhuangzi·Kèyì Chapter* [《庄子·刻意篇》], which says:\n*'To carve one’s intentions and pursue conduct, to abandon the world and defy customs, to indulge in lofty rhetoric and lament grievances—this is but excess.\nThis is the delight of **mountain-valley recluses**, not of the common world, nor of those who wither and rush to the abyss.\n\nTo speak of *rén* [仁], *yì* [义], loyalty, sincerity, reverence, frugality, and yielding—this is the pursuit of **cultivation**.\nThis is the delight of **ordinary scholars**, teachers, and those who dwell in study.\n\nTo speak of great deeds, to establish great names, to order the relations of ruler and subject, to rectify the hierarchy of superior and inferior—this is the pursuit of **governance**.\nThis is the delight of **court scholars**, those who honor their lords and strengthen their states, and those who achieve comprehensive success.\n\nTo seek the marshes and wilds, to dwell in secluded places, to fish in quiet pools—this is the pursuit of **non-action**.\nThis is the delight of **river-and-sea recluses**, those who avoid the world, and those who dwell in leisure.\n\nTo practice breathing exercises, to exhale the stale and inhale the fresh, to stretch like the bear and bend like the wild ox—this is the pursuit of **longevity**.\nThis is the delight of **导引 practitioners**, those who nurture the form, and those who attain the age of Pengzu.\n\nBut if one does not carve intentions yet remains lofty, does not practice *rén* and *yì* yet cultivates, achieves no fame yet governs, avoids no river-and-sea yet dwells in leisure, does not practice导引 yet attains longevity—\nthen there is neither forgetting nor possessing,\nneither excess nor deficiency,\nbut a boundless tranquility from which all perfections arise.\nThis is the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**, the **virtue of the Sage**.*\n\nNow, the *Bìxū* [碧虚] takes this to illustrate the meaning of **release as if present, if absent** [解若存若亡].\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"The **low-ranking scholar** receives a nature of coarseness and humiliation. His eyes desire to see colors, his ears desire to hear sounds, his mouth desires to savor flavors, his spirit desires to be sated. If he does not obtain these, he falls into great anxiety and fear.\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*'The eyes desire to see colors'*—this is from the *Zhuangzi·Tiězhí Chapter* [《庄子·盗跖篇》], which says:\n*'The eyes desire to see colors, the ears desire to hear sounds, the mouth desires to savor flavors, the spirit desires to be sated. And if one does not obtain these, then he falls into great anxiety and fear.'*\nAgain, the *Zhuangzi·Zhìlè Chapter* [《庄子·至乐篇》] says:\n*'What the world holds in honor are riches, nobility, longevity, and goodness.\nWhat it finds joy in are bodily comfort, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful colors, and pleasing music.\nWhat it holds in contempt are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice.\nWhat it suffers from are not obtaining bodily comfort, not tasting rich flavors, not wearing fine garments, not seeing beautiful colors, and not hearing pleasing music.\nIf one does not obtain these, then he falls into great anxiety and fear. How foolish to cling to such a form!*\n\nThese preceding passages serve to illustrate the differing perspectives of the **upper, middle, and lower scholars** in their understanding of release.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] further cites **Lǚ Xīshēng** [陆希声]:\n*\"What transcends form is called the **Dao**.\nThe **Dao** is what permeates beyond form.\nWhat is beneath form is called **instrumentality**.\n**Instrumentality** is what rectifies within form.\nThe **upper scholar** knows the subtle and the manifest, transcending beyond form.\nThe **lower scholar** knows only the manifest and not the subtle, confined within form.\"*\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"These words are from the *Yìjīng·Xìshuō* [《易系》].\nThey are already recorded in the first chapter of the *Dàodéjīng*, so no need to repeat them here.\nThus, Master Lǚ took them to illustrate the differing perspectives of the upper, middle, and lower scholars.\"*\n\nThere is a saying:\n*\"Clarifying the Dao seems like obscurity,\nMaking the Dao plain seems like confusion,\nAdvancing the Dao seems like retreat.\n**Supreme virtue** seems like a valley,\n**Great whiteness** seems like humiliation,\n**Broad virtue** seems like insufficiency,\n**Establishing virtue** seems like theft.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"A skilled merchant hides his goods as if empty,\nA man of **abundant virtue** appears with a countenance of **foolishness**.\"*\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"This is the speech of Laozi teaching Confucius, as recorded in the *Shǐjì·Lièzhuàn* [《史记·列传》].\nIt has already been explained in the opening section.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"Wú Yún’s *Xuángāng Lùn* [《玄纲论》] states: ‘**Function** should be concealed, **faults** should be exposed.’\"*\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"Master Wú’s *Xuángāng Lùn* [《玄纲论》], in the chapter on ‘Establishing Function and Rectifying Faults,’ states:\n‘**Function** should be concealed, **faults** should be exposed—\nIf **function** is concealed, it may be preserved;\nIf **faults** are exposed, they may be extinguished.\nIf **function** is not preserved and **faults** are not extinguished,\nThen how could one’s name be inscribed in the **Immortal Register**?\nLong life is not to be hoped for.\n\nYet **function** need not be grand—\nWhen encountering things, one rescues them;\n**Faults** need not be grave—\nWhen recognizing error, one corrects it.\nOne need not rush to establish **function**,\nNor exhaust oneself in rectifying **faults**.\n**Faults**, once corrected, should not recur;\n**Function**, once established, should not falter—\nThis is called **daily renewing one’s virtue**,\nAnd thus the **Heavenly Aid** comes naturally.\n\nBecause **function** should be concealed,\nIt is said: *‘Establishing virtue seems like theft.’*\n**True substance** seems like deception.’\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"**True substance** refers to unadulterated purity.\"*\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"Unadulterated purity—\nAs in the *Zhuāngzǐ·Kèyì* [《庄子·刻意》]:\n‘He who embodies **pure simplicity** is called the **True Person.’**\"\n\n*\"The **Great Square** has no corners.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"**Dì** [砥] and **Lì** [砺]

Square**.\nIf there is differing, it is not the **Great Square**.’\"*\n\n*\"Great vessels take long to complete.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"Great vessels—\nLike the **Nine Cauldrons** and **Húluán** [瑚琏],\nCannot be finished in a single day.\"*\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"The **Nine Cauldrons**—these are great cauldrons.\nThe *Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn* [《黄帝内传》] says:\n‘The Yellow Emperor mined copper from Tóushǒu Shān [首山],\nAnd cast the cauldron at Jīngshān [荆山], now the southern outskirts of Lake City,\nWhich is also called **Jīngshān** or **Zhùdǐngyuán** [铸鼎原].\nSome say it was cast by Xià Yǔ [夏禹].\nZèngzǐ Gù [曾子固] in the *Quánzhēn Táng Jì* [《全真堂记》] says:\n‘The nine regions contributed gold,\nAnd Xià Yǔ cast them into the **Nine Cauldrons**,\nWithin which were depicted the mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, birds, and beasts of the nine regions.\nThus, it is known that they were cast by Xià Yǔ.’\n\nAs for **Húluán** [瑚琏]—\nIn the *Lǔyǔ·Gōngyězhǎng* [《鲁语·公冶长》]:\nZǐgòng [子贡] asked:\n‘How would you assess me?’\nThe Master said:\n‘You are a vessel.’\nHe asked:\n‘What kind of vessel?’\nThe Master said:\n‘A **Húluán** [瑚琏].’\nBāo [包] said:\n‘**Hú** refers to the vessels for millet and rice;\nIn Xià, it was called **Hú**,\nIn Yīn, it was called **Chán** [缠],\nIn Zhōu, it was called **Dòngluán** [董篮]—\nThese were the most noble vessels for ancestral temples and sacrifices.’\n\nNow, these **Nine Cauldrons** and **Húluán**—\nThey are the most complete, grand, and noble of vessels.\nTheir creation was not accomplished in a single morning or evening.\nSimilarly, how could the **Worthy and Sage** achieve their worthiness and sagacity\nWithout years of effort and deeds?\nYet accumulated habits become natural,\nAnd perfection arises from enduring time.\nThus it is said: *‘Great vessels take long to complete.’*\n\nAgain, perfection arising from enduring time—\nAs in the *Zhuāngzǐ·Rénjiānshì* [《庄子·人间世》]:\nLèigōng Zǐgāo [叶公子高] was about to be sent as an envoy to Qí [齐],\nAnd he consulted Zhòngní [仲尼].\nZhòngní instructed him.\nThus, the *Fǎyán* [法言] says:\n‘Do not urge what is not yet ripe,\nNor hasten what is not yet complete—\nExceeding the proper measure harms progress.\nUrging what is not yet ripe and hastening what is not yet complete\nAre perilous to affairs.\nPerfection arises from enduring time,\nAnd what is flawed cannot be rectified once complete—\nHow can one not be cautious?’\"*\n\n*\"Heaven alone follows the **Dao**,\nGenerously lending and completing.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"Only this **Mysterious Dao** can move **spirits and gods**,\nGive birth to **Heaven and Earth**.\"*\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"This is the text from the *Zhuāngzǐ·Dàzōngshī* [《庄子·大宗师》].\nIt has already been fully recorded in the opening chapter of this scripture,\nSo it is not repeated here.\nIn essence, it speaks of how the **Great Dao** generously lends itself to all things,\nAnd all things draw upon it to take form.\"*\n\n*\"Chapter 42: The **Dao** Generates One\"*\n*\"The **Dao** generates **One**,\n**One** generates **Two**,\n**Two** generates **Three**,\n**Three** generates **Ten Thousand

the text from the *Lièzǐ·Tiānrú* [《列子·天瑞》].\nIt has already been fully recorded in Chapter 40 of this scripture,\nSo it is omitted here.\"*\n\n*\"All things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,\nAnd the **Harmonizing Qi** completes them.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n*\"If a gentleman does not disturb his **heart**,\nThen the **浩然** *hàorán* **qi** may be nurtured.\"*\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*\"The preceding text comes from the *Mèngzǐ·Gōngsūnchǒu Zhāngjù Shàng* [《孟子·公孙丑章句上》].\nGōngsūnchǒu [公孙丑] asked:\n‘If the Master were to become a high official in Qí [齐],\nAnd could put the **Dao** into practice,\nEven if he thereby became a **Conqueror-King**, it would make no difference.\nIn such a case, would the Master’s **heart** still be unsettled?’\nMèngzǐ said:\n‘No, at forty, my **heart** does not move.’\nHe asked:\n‘If that is so, then the Master surpasses Mèng Rèn [孟轲] by a great margin.’\"*\n\n「Gōngsūnchǒu said:\n“This is not difficult. **Gèzǐ** [告子] first achieved *bùdòngxīn* [不动心] before me.”\n\n**Gèzǐ** [姓告名不害], whose surname is Gè [告] and given name is Bùhài [不害].\n“Zǐ [子]” is a general term for males.\n**Mèng Rèn** [孟贲] was brave in strength, but I am brave in **virtue and righteousness** [德义], hence I say, “This is not difficult.”\nSince **Gèzǐ** [告子] had not yet reached forty with *bùdòngxīn* [不动心], it is said he surpassed me, let alone **Mèng Rèn** [孟子]!\n\nGōngsūnchǒu asked:\n“May I venture to ask how the Master’s *bùdòngxīn* [不动心] differs from **Gèzǐ**’s *bùdòngxīn* [不动心]? Can I hear the explanation?”\n\n**Gèzǐ** [告子] replied:\n“If you cannot grasp it through words, do not demand it of the **heart**.\nIf you cannot grasp it in the **heart**, do not demand it of the **qi**.\nIf you cannot grasp it in the **heart**, do not demand it of the **qi**, then [you may proceed].\nIf you cannot grasp it through words, do not demand it of the **heart**, then [you cannot].\n\n“The **志** *zhì* is the **qi**’s commander.\nThe **qi** fills the **body** [体].\nThe **heart** and **志** are where thoughts and deliberations arise.\nThe **qi** is what fills and satisfies the form and body, giving rise to joy and anger.\nThe **志** commands the **qi** and sets it in motion, determining its suitability or not.\nWhen the **志** is set, the **qi** follows.\nThe **志** is the most essential foundation, while the **qi** follows and adapts to it.\nHence it is said: **Hold fast to your志, and do not let your qi rage** [持其志，无暴其气].\n*Bào* [暴] means disorder.\nIt means that when the **志** is directed, the **qi** will follow—so one must firmly hold to the **志**, lest it be disordered, and then the **qi** will remain stable, allowing joy and anger to act upon others.\n\nHaving said, “The **志** is set, the **qi** follows,”\nAnd also, “**Hold fast to your志, and do not let your qi rage**,”\nWhy is this so?\n\nIt is because:\nWhen the **志** is unified, it moves the **qi**,\nAnd when the **qi** is unified, it moves the **志**.\n*Chá* [查] means stagnant and unexpressed.\nNow, those who hurry and rush—\nThis is their **qi**, yet it turns back and disturbs their **heart**.\n**Mèngzǐ** spoke of how a person’s **志** and **qi** become confined and stagnant, thus unified.\nWhen the **志** is confined, the **qi** cannot move freely,\nAnd when the **qi** is confined, the **志** cannot express itself.\nThose who now walk with a furrowed brow—\nIt is because their **qi** is blocked and they cannot control themselves,\nSo their **志** and **qi** become inverted.\nBetween inversion and stagnation, there is no way to avoid movement and fear.\n\nThus, the **志** and **qi** assist each other.\nMay I ask how the Master excels?\n\nThe Master replied:\n“I know how to speak, and I am skilled at nurturing my **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**.”\n\nMay I ask what is meant by **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**?\n\nThe Master replied:\n“It is hard to explain.\nThis **qi** is supremely vast and robust,\nNurtured with uprightness and without harm,\nThen it fills the space between heaven and earth.\nThis **qi**, when aligned with **righteousness** [义] and the **Dao/Way** [道],\nLacks it, and it withers.\nThis is the **qi** born from gathering **righteousness** [义],\nNot seized by **righteousness** clinging to it.\n*Jí* [集] means intermingling.\nIt means that **浩然** *hàorán* **qi** arises naturally from its mingling with **righteousness** [仁义],\nNot from artificially applying **righteousness** to take it.\nHence it is said: “This **qi** is born from gathering **righteousness**,\nNot seized by **righteousness** clinging to it.”\nIf one’s actions do not conform to the **heart**’s intent,\nThen it withers.\n*Zhuàn* [赚] means swift and harmonious.\nWhen one reflects inwardly and finds that their practice of **righteousness** [仁义] is incomplete,\nHarming the **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**,\nThen they suffer from a gnawing hunger in their chest.\nHence, things may either be lost to gain or gained to lose.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n“Those who humble themselves to cultivate their **virtue** [德].”\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n“This is the *Yì·Tiǎn* [《易·谦卦》] initial sixth line’s text.\nIt has been repeatedly explained before, so it will not be repeated here.”\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n“Through humility, one receives benefit.”\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n“The *Shàngshū·Dàyǔ Mó* [《尚书·大禹谟》] states:\n‘**Yǐ** [益] praised **Yǔ** [禹], saying:\n“Only **virtue/power** moves heaven,\nReaching even the most distant without fail.\nFullness invites loss, humility invites gain—\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of heaven.”\n\nNow, **Bìxū** [碧虚] takes from *Lìzǐ* [《列子》] the passage where **qi** and form are complete yet undivided,\nHence it says: *“The undivided”* [浑沦], to illustrate the meaning of the **Dao/Way** giving rise to unity.\nAgain, it takes **Mèngzǐ**’s *“浩然”* [浩然] to illustrate the meaning of the **Harmonizing Qi** completing all things.\nAgain, it takes the *Yì* [《易》]’s *“谦卦”* [Tiǎn Coordinate] passage *“Through humility, one cultivates oneself”* [卑以自牧],\nAnd the *Shū* [《书》]’s *“Dàyǔ Mó”* [《大禹谟》] passage *“Through humility, one receives benefit”* [以谦受益],\nTo illustrate the meaning of *“Things may either be lost to gain or gained to lose”*.\nFinally, it concludes with *“The strong **粱** [strong grain] cannot find its proper end”* [强粱者不得其死],\nAnd I will take this as my **teacher** [教父],\nWhose sincere admonitions and exhortations to the world are profound indeed.\n\n**Chapter 43: The Ultimate Softness of the World** [天下之至柔]\n*Wúyǒu* [无有] enters into *wújiàn* [无间].\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n“**Zhuāngzǐ** [庄子] said:\n‘Gold and stone cannot be pierced—\nWithout them, there is nothing to resound.’\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*The *Zhuāngzǐ·Tiāndì* [《庄子·天地篇》] states:\n“The Master said:\n‘The **Dao/Way** [道] dwells deep within—\nIts sound is vast and clear.\nGold and stone cannot be pierced—\nWithout them, there is nothing to resound.\nGold and stone have sound,\nBut without striking, they cannot resound.\nWho among all things can truly stabilize them?’\n\nNow, **Bìxū** [碧虚] uses this to explain:\nThat gold and stone are firm and impenetrable objects.\nYet when struck, they produce sound—\nThis is because they internally harbor **Dao/Way qi** [道气], making them so.\nThe **Dao/Way qi** is *wúyǒu* [无有].\nGold and stone are *wújiàn* [无间].\nNow, this **Dao/Way** of emptiness and void,\nAble to enter gold and stone,\nIs it not precisely *wúyǒu* entering *wújiàn*?\n\nI have heard in *The Book of Transformation·Dao/Way of Transformation* [《化书·道化篇》]:\n‘The dragon died on **Chǒuyáng Shān** [首阳之山].\nThe distinction between reality and illusion is so clear.’\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] further says:\n“Yet those who are **悠悠** *yōuyōu* [lofty and detached] rush after fame without end—\nAre they merely caught between leisure and suffering, joy and pain?\nThis is also from *The Yáng Zhū Pian* [《扬朱篇》].\n**Chángzǐ** [常子] said:\n‘Abandon the **命令** *mìnglìng* [fixed rules], and there will be no suffering.’\n**Lǎozǐ** [老子] said:\n‘**Name** [名] is the **guest** of the **real** [实].’\nYet those who are **悠悠** *yōuyōu* [lofty and detached] rush after fame without end—\nHow can **Name** be abandoned?\nHow can **Name** be a **guest** of the **real**?\n\nNow, having a **Name** brings honor and respect,\nLacking a **Name** brings disgrace and shame.\nHonor and respect bring leisure and joy,\nDisgrace and shame bring suffering and pain.\nSuffering and pain are what offend one’s **nature** [性],\nWhile leisure and joy are what align with one’s **nature**.\nThis is where the **real** is tied!\n\nHow can **Name** be abandoned?\nHow can **Name** be a **guest** of the **real**?\nOnly that one should hate those who cling to **Name** and burden the **real**.\nClinging to **Name** and burdening the **real**—\nThis is what leads to the failure to save the perishing,\nAnd how can one merely be caught between leisure and suffering, joy and pain?\n\nHence, **Bìxū** [碧虚] takes these passages,\nTo illustrate the distinction of whether **Name** or **body** [身] is closer to one’s self.»\n\nThe *Zhuàn* further states: The likes of Bào Jiāo and Zǐ Tuī were those who clung to **Name** and burdened the **real**.\n\nThe *Jiǎo* [钞] explains: Bào Jiāo and Zǐ Tuī—\nThe *Zhuāngzi·Táo Zhí* [盗跖] chapter states: *\"Bào Jiāo adorned his conduct beyond the world’s norms, embracing death by clinging to a tree. His surname was Bào, given name Jiāo, a recluse of the Zhou era. He adorned his conduct beyond the world’s norms; maintaining purity and integrity, he carried burdens, gathered firewood, and gathered acorns for sustenance. He did not serve the Son of Heaven nor associate with feudal lords. Zǐ Gòng encountered him and said, ‘I have heard that one should not tread upon lands whose governance one disapproves, nor accept benefits from a ruler one deems corrupt. Yet you walk upon this land and consume its benefits—is this acceptable?’ Bào Jiāo replied, ‘I have heard that a virtuous man values advancement but scorns retreat, that the worthy are easily shamed but lightly regard death.’ Thus, he embraced the tree and withered away.\"*\n\nJìe Zǐ Tuī was the epitome of loyalty, having cut his own thigh to feed Wén Gōng. Later, when Wén Gōng betrayed him, Zǐ Tuī departed in anger, embracing a tree until he perished in flames.\n\nIn the past, when Jìn Wén Gōng (Zhòng Ēr) was young, he faced the hardship of his stepmother Lì Jī’s plot. Lì Jī’s son was Yí Jiù. She sought to dethrone Zhòng Ēr and establish Yí Jiù, repeatedly slandering him to Xiàn Gōng. The king believed her, and Zhòng Ēr fled into exile. Along the way, starving, Zǐ Tuī cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Wén Gōng. Later, when Zhòng Ēr returned to ascend the throne as Wén Gōng, he rewarded his followers but forgot Zǐ Tuī. The latter composed the *Lóngshé* [龙蛇] song, inscribed it on the camp gate, and departed in fury. The king then regretted his neglect and pursued Zǐ Tuī to Jiè Shān—also called Mián Shān. When Zǐ Tuī refused to emerge, the king set the mountain ablaze. Though flames surrounded him, he did not flee but perished, clinging to a tree.\n\nNow, Bìxū [碧虚] discusses these two men as examples of those who clung to **Name** and burdened the **real**.\n\nBetween **body** and wealth, which is more burdensome?\nThe *Zhuàn* states: The wealthy toil endlessly, amassing riches they cannot fully enjoy—thus, their **body** is enslaved externally. The noble labor night and day, fretting over right and wrong—thus, their **body** is neglected.\n\nThe *Jiǎo* [钞] cites the *Zhuāngzi·Zhì Lè* [至乐] chapter: *\"What the world esteems are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful women, melodious music. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice. What it suffers are bodily discomfort, lack of delicacies, unattractive attire, unpleasing sights, and discordant sounds. If these are denied, great anxiety and fear arise. Thus, the **body** is treated as a mere tool.\"*\n\nThe wealthy toil endlessly, amassing riches they cannot fully enjoy—thus, their **body** is enslaved externally. The noble labor night and day, fretting over right and wrong—thus, their **body** is neglected. Human life is born with sorrow; the long-lived grow dull, enduring prolonged suffering without end—how far their **body** is from true ease!\n\nFrom this perspective, the wealthy and noble pursue **Name** and sacrifice for gain, bearing lifelong sorrow and knowing no true joy. Thus, Bìxū [碧虚] cites this to illustrate which is more burdensome—**body** or wealth.\n\nBetween gain and loss, which brings greater affliction?\nThe *Zhuàn* states: Zhuāngzi said, *\"Those who cultivate their **mind** forget the **body**; those who nourish the **body** forget gain; those who attain the **Dao** forget the **heart**.\"*\n\nThe *Jiǎo* [钞] explains: This is from the *Zhuāngzi·Ràng Wáng* [让王] chapter: *\"Zēngzǐ, residing in Wèi, wore tattered robes with no lining, his face swollen and discolored. His hands and feet were calloused, and for three days he did not light a fire; for ten years, he did not mend his clothes. His hat’s ribbon frayed, his sleeves were threadbare, and his sandals were worn through. Dragging his tattered garments, he sang the *Shāng Sòng* hymns, his voice filling heaven and earth like chimes and bells. Neither the Son of Heaven could command him as a subject nor feudal lords as a friend. Thus, those who cultivate their **mind** forget the **body**; those who nourish the **body** forget gain; those who attain the **Dao** forget the **heart**.\"*\n\nHere, the *Zhuàn* further cites two passages from the *Zhuāngzi·Ràng Wáng* chapter—both complete in themselves—without need of repetition, to illustrate which brings greater affliction: gain or loss, and the meaning of *\"knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Dàchéng Ruò Quē [大成若缺]**\nGreat completion resembles deficiency,\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness,\nIts use is boundless.\n\n「He said: *\"You are heading toward the Great Abyss.\"* He asked: *\"What is the purpose of this?\"*\nHe replied: *\"The Great Abyss, as a thing, is filled yet never overflows, drawn from yet never exhausted. I intend to wander there.\"*\nThus, **Bìqū** employs this to illustrate the meaning of *\"its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\nThe Great Abyss refers to the **Great Sea**.\n\nAs for the meaning of *\"clear mirror\"* (**Míngyíng**), it has already been fully elucidated in Chapter Twenty-Five.\n\n**Bìqū** further states:\n*\"Those who possess great virtue and grand undertakings\"*—the **Quánshū** records:\n*\"‘Great virtue’ is called ‘renewal’ (xīn), and ‘grand undertakings’ are called ‘wealthy abundance’ (fùyǒu).\"* (This is from the *Yì Jì* commentary.)\n\n*\"Great virtue and grand undertakings are indeed consummate!\"*\nHence, **Bìqū** selects this to explain that one who attains such great virtue and such grand undertakings may be called *\"great fullness.\"* Yet, their outward demeanor remains ever humble and unassuming, never arrogant.\nMoreover, even when wealth and nobility fill the halls and chambers—gold and jade adorning every room—they can still maintain frugality and simplicity, never extravagant.\nThus, their use is always abundant with surplus, never depleted or exhausted.\n\n*\"Great skill resembles clumsiness\"* (**Dàqiǎo ruò zhuō**):\nThe **Zhuàn** cites the *Lièzǐ* as saying:\n*\"A man of Sòng, crafting leaves of jade for his lord, did not rely on his cleverness and skill.\"* (This is from the *Lièzǐ·Shuō Fú* chapter.)\n\nThe **Quánshū** notes:\n*\"This text is from the *Lièzǐ·Shuō Fú* chapter.\"*\n\nThe **Zhuàn** states that the beginning and end are complete, requiring no repetition.\n\n*\"Great skill resembles clumsiness\"*:\nThe **Zhuàn** cites **Zhuāngzǐ** as saying:\n*\"He who covers and sustains the heavens and earth, carves and shapes all forms, yet does not consider himself skilled—how could one who merely crafts jade leaves for his lord be deemed skilled?\"*\n\n*\"Great eloquence resembles inarticulateness\"* (**Dàbiàn ruò nè**):\nThe **Zhuàn** notes:\n*\"One who does not speak against what is not lawful.\"*\n\nThe **Quánshū** records:\n*\"This is from the *Xiàojīng* (Classic of Filial Piety), in the chapter on 'Qīngdàfū' (Noblemen and Great Officers), where it states:\n'If it is not the lawful attire of the ancient kings, I dare not wear it. If it is not the virtuous conduct of the ancient kings, I dare not practice it. If it is not the proper speech of the ancient kings, I dare not utter it. Thus, I do not speak against what is not lawful, nor act against what is not the Way. My words fill the world without error, my conduct fills the world without grievance. When these three are complete, then one can safeguard their ancestral temples. This is the filial piety of noblemen and great officers.'\n\nThe *Shī* (Odes) says:\n*'Day and night without slackness, serving one person.'*\nThis serves as evidence to elucidate the meaning of 'not speaking against what is not lawful.'\n\nThe **Zhuàn** further notes:\n*'One who does not speak against what is not proper (礼).'*\n\nThe **Quánshū** records:\n*\"This is from the *Lúnyǔ* (Analects), in the *Yán Yuān* (Preface to Yan Yuan) chapter, where it states:\nPreface to Yan Yuan asked about *rén* (benevolence). The Master said:\n*'To restrain oneself and return to propriety is benevolence. Restraint—this is self-discipline. Return—this is restoration. When one’s self can restore propriety, then one is benevolent. If one day restrains oneself and returns to propriety, all under Heaven will turn to benevolence. The practice of benevolence depends on oneself—how could it depend on others?'*\n\nYan Yuan said:\n*'May I ask its particulars?'*\n\nThe Master said:\n*'Do not look at what is not proper, do not listen to what is not proper, do not speak of what is not proper, do not act on what is not proper.'*\n\nYan Yuan said:\n*'Though I am dull-witted, I will act upon these words.'*\n\nThus, it is said: *'One does not speak against what is not proper.'*\nNow, **Bìqū** selects these instances of 'not speaking against what is not lawful' and 'not speaking against what is not proper,' meaning he does nothing contrived, hence his speech seems inarticulate.\n\nMoreover, it is heard that Confucius said:\n*'The superior man desires to be inarticulate in speech yet swift in action.'*\nThis is also the same meaning.\nThus, it is said: *\"Great eloquence resembles inarticulateness.\"*\n\n*\"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat; clarity and tranquility are the true essence of the world.\"*\n\nThe **Zhuàn** cites **Zhuāngzǐ** as saying:\n*\"Embrace the numinous with stillness, and the form will naturally align itself—thus one may attain longevity.\"*\n\nThe **Quánshū** records:\n*\"This is from the *Zhuāngzǐ*, in the *Zàiyòu* (On Nurturing Life) chapter.\"*\n\nThe twenty-first chapter has already been fully elaborated. Therefore, Bìqū cites these passages to illustrate the principle of *\"clearing and stillness as the true essence of the world.\"*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: When the Dao Prevails in the World**\n\n*\"When the Dao prevails in the world, warhorses are driven back to manure the fields.\"*\n\nThe **Zhuàn** states: *\"When the Dao prevails in the world\"* refers to a time of great prosperity.\n\nThe **Quánshū** records: *\"Speaking of a time of great prosperity\"*—this is from the *Tàiqǔ* (Co-Partnership) hexagram of the *Yìjīng* (Book of Changes), where **Kǎn** (Earth) is below and **Qián** (Heaven) above.\n\n*\"Tài\"*—when the small yields to the great, it brings auspiciousness and flourishing.\nThe *Xiàng* (Judgment) states: *\"Tài—when the small yields to the great, it brings auspiciousness and flourishing.\"* This signifies the interaction of Heaven and Earth, allowing all things to flourish. The upper and lower realms interact harmoniously, their intentions aligned. Within, there is **yang** vitality, and without, there is **yin** compliance; within, the **junzi** (noble one) prevails, and without, the petty folk decline—thus, the Way of the **junzi** thrives, while the Way of the petty folk wanes.\n\nThe *Xiàng* states: *\"Heaven and Earth interact—this is Tài.\"*\n\nLater sages followed this principle, completing the Way of Heaven and Earth, assisting and harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s natural order, to govern the people from both sides.\n\nNow, Bìqū cites these passages to explain that in a time of great prosperity, all things flourish, ancestral temples shine, the realm is at peace, and the feudal lords come as guests. Even the common folk live in joy and contentment—such is the state when the Dao prevails in the world.\n\n*\"When the Dao does not prevail in the world, warhorses are bred in the suburbs.\"*\n\nThe **Zhuàn** states: *\"When the Dao does not prevail in the world\"* refers to a time of decline.\n\nThe **Quánshū** records: *\"Speaking of a time of decline\"*—this is from the *Pǐqǔ* (Opposition) hexagram of the *Yìjīng*, where **Kǎn** (Earth) is below and **Qián** (Heaven) above.\n\n*\"Pǐ\"*—the unprincipled do not prosper; it is not advantageous for the **junzi** to maintain integrity, as the great yields to the small.\nThe *Xiàng* states: *\"Pǐ—the unprincipled do not prosper; it is not advantageous for the **junzi** to maintain integrity, as the great yields to the small.\"* This signifies that Heaven and Earth do not interact, and all things do not flourish. The upper and lower realms do not interact, and the world lacks order. Within, there is **yin** passivity, and without, there is **yang** rigidity; within, the petty folk prevail, and without, the **junzi** decline—thus, the Way of the petty folk thrives, while the Way of the **junzi** wanes.\n\nThe *Xiàng* states: *\"Heaven and Earth do not interact—this is Pǐ.\"*\n\nThe **junzi** should cultivate frugality in virtue to avoid misfortune and should not seek honor through wealth.\n\nNow, Bìqū cites these passages to explain that in a time of decline, official duties are neglected, the ruler is troubled, the treasury is depleted, and calamities of flood and drought occur frequently. The separation of **yin** and **yang** leads to suffering among all living beings—such is the state when the Dao does not prevail in the world.\n\n*\"No greater crime exists than indulging in desire.\"*\n\nThe **Guī** begins:\n\n**Initial Nine:** *Lǚ xiào miè zhǐ, wú jiù.*\n*\"The fetter destroys the toe—no blame.\"*\n\n**Image (Xiàng):** *\"The fetter destroys the toe—[this signifies] non-action.\"*\n\n**Explanation:**\n*Xiào* refers to restraints—such as the wooden stocks used for offenders like the *shù zǔ* (ancestral trees of guilt, e.g., *guì* or *jú*).\n*Zhǐ* means the foot. Now, in the case of the **Initial Nine**, at the outset of transgression, the fetter binds the foot—this is to compel reform, yet the offender refuses to abandon wrongdoing. Later, in the **Upper Nine**, when the fault is already grave, the offender still refuses repentance, accumulating guilt until it becomes irredeemable, culminating in extreme punishment. Thus, the fetter is applied to the ear, blinding the mind—this is what *\"the fetter destroys the ear, and wisdom is obscured\"* truly means.\n\nHence, it is said: *\"The fetter destroys the ear, and wisdom is obscured.\"* Therefore, the *Zhuàn* states: *\"Those who indulge in arrogant extravagance will inevitably meet the calamity of the fetter.\"* And since the calamity of the fetter originates from yielding to desire, no greater crime exists than indulging in desire.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* further cites: *\"The man of Qi seized gold.\"*\nThe *Chāo* notes: *\"This is the concluding passage of the *Lièzǐ·Yuè Fú* chapter.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn*’s text is now complete, and thus no further elaboration is given.\n\n「The *Zhuàn* says: *\"He who gazes upon turbid waters and loses himself in clear springs.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"This is from the *Zhuāngzǐ·Shān Mù* chapter.\"* **Zhuāng Zhou** wandered in the **Diāolíng** wilderness, where he saw a strange crow from the southern lands—its wingspan seven feet wide, its eyes as large as a *yùn* measure (inch), drawn to his scent and alighting in the **Lìlín**. Zhuāng Zhou said: *\"What kind of bird is this? Its vast wings do not soar, and its great eyes do not perceive.\"* He raised his hem and quickened his steps, plucked a pebble and hurled it, causing the crow to retreat. He saw a cicada, basking in the fine shade and forgetting its own body; the mantis seized its wings and struck at it, seeing its prey and forgetting its own form; the strange crow swooped down to take advantage, seeing profit and forgetting its true nature. Zhuāng Zhou sighed and said: *\"Alas! Things are indeed bound to one another, and the two types call to each other.\"* He discarded the pebble and turned back, but the **Yúrén** (keeper of wildfowl) pursued him, criticizing his actions and questioning his motives. Zhuāng Zhou returned home, and for three months he did not attend court. **Lán Qiè** and **Zǐyú** came to ask him: *\"Master, why have you been so absent from court these days?\"* Zhuāng Zhou replied: *\"I have preserved my form and forgotten my body, gazing upon turbid waters and losing myself in clear springs. Moreover, I have heard from my teacher that, ‘Enter their customs, follow their ways.’ Now I wander in the **Diāolíng** wilderness and forget my own body; the strange crow is drawn to my scent, alighting in the **Lìlín** and forgetting its true nature, while the **Yúrén** of **Lìlín** takes me as their quarry. Hence, I have not attended court.\"* Now taking this as a parable, it is said that those who are bewildered by desire rarely escape its punishments. Just as Zhuāng Zhou wandered in the **Diāolíng** wilderness, gazing upon turbid waters and losing himself in clear springs. Therefore, **Bìxū** (the Daoist sage) says: *\"No greater calamity than seeking what one desires.\"* The *Zhuàn* further says: *\"There is none left untouched.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"Referring to the *Máo Shī·Dàyǎ·Yún Hàn* chapter, which states: ‘The Milky Way follows the Chou Duke, follows the Chou Duke, the great official of the Zhou.’ It praises King Xuan of Zhou. When the drought was severe, it could not be dispelled, and he worked tirelessly in fear, like thunder and lightning, saving the people of Zhou—none were left untouched. Here, ‘dispelled’ means ‘removed.’ ‘Tirelessly’ signifies ‘dread,’ and ‘dangerous’ denotes ‘fear.’ It says that King Xuan of Zhou, anxious about the excessive drought of his time, labored tirelessly in dread, like thunder and lightning striking overhead, so that none of his people were left alone to escape the calamity. Now **Bìxū** takes this ‘none left untouched’ to mean otherwise. He blames those who covet all things under heaven, whether seen or unseen, desiring to possess them all, leaving none untouched, so that everything is under their control—this is no greater excess than their insatiable greed. How much less can it be confined to harming just one person? This calamity must surely extend to their descendants and future generations. Hence, it is said: *‘No greater calamity than seeking what one desires.’* Chapter Forty-Seven: *\"Knowing the world without leaving one’s door.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* says: *\"When one eats, he thinks of those who hunger in the world; when one clothes himself, he thinks of those who shiver in the world. Loving his own elders, he knows of the aged everywhere; pitying his own children, he knows of the young everywhere.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"The *Mèngzǐ·Lí Lóu* chapter states: ‘Yú (the Great Yu) and Jì (the Patriarch of Agriculture) lived in peaceful times, yet passed their doors three times before entering. The Master (Confucius) praised them. Yán Zǐ (Yan Hui) lived in turbulent times, dwelling in a humble lane, eating from a single basket of rice, drinking from a single gourd, while others could not bear his hardships—Yán Zǐ remained unchanged in his joy. The Master praised him.’ Mèngzǐ said: ‘Yú, Jì, and Yán Hui share the same Dao. Yú thought of those drowning in the world as if they were himself drowning. Jì thought of those starving in the world as if they were himself starving. Great Yú governed the world’s floods, and Hou Jì taught the world to sow and cultivate. Hence, their urgency was so great. Yú, Jì, and Yán Zǐ shared the same Dao, and if their positions were exchanged, they would act likewise. Moreover, the *Mèngzǐ·Liáng Huì Wáng* chapter states: ‘Revere my elders as I do my own; extend this reverence to all elders. Love my children as I do my own; extend this love to all children. Then the world may be governed as if it were in the palm of my hand.’ All this is the Dao of observing oneself to understand one’s family, and one’s family to understand the world. How much more so is it the Dao of observing oneself to understand the world! If one can do this, why must he wait to leave his door before knowing the world?\"*\n\n*\"Seeing the Dao without peering through windows.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* says: *\"The sovereign (ruler) aligns himself with the **Èr Yí** (Two Principles: Heaven and Earth) in virtue, and with the sun and moon in radiance. He precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose him; he follows Heaven, and he conforms to the Heavenly order.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"The *Yì·Xiān·Kàn* (Commentary on the *Kàn* Hexagram of the *Yìjīng*) states: ‘The great person aligns himself with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in radiance, with the four seasons in their sequence, and with spirits and gods in their blessings and omens. He precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose him; he follows Heaven, and he conforms to the Heavenly order.’ It says that if one acts before the Heavenly order, the Dao will comply and not oppose. If one acts after the Heavenly order, one must conform to the Dao and not dare to defy it. Now if a ruler can do this, the Dao will be clear without his need to peer through windows or gaze afar. Moreover, I have heard that **Shào Yáo Fú** composed a poem: ‘One thing originates from one self, one self contains one heaven and earth. Knowing all things are complete within me, why set the Three Realms apart? Heaven divides creation from the One, while man weaves schemes from the heart. Heaven and man share no dual purpose—Dao acts without deception, only through man.’ This may be called ‘seeing the Dao without peering through windows.’ The *Zhuàn* further says: ‘Hence, those who understand the sayings of death and life—*the Yì·Shàng Xì* states: ‘He looks upward to observe the celestial patterns, and downward to examine the earthly features, thus knowing the reasons behind the hidden and the manifest.’\"*\n\n「Returning to the origin and reflecting upon the end, one thus understands the sayings of death and life. This is what is meant by them.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* further cites **Yán Jūn Píng** as saying: ‘Those who extinguish the Three Five [cycles]—this meaning has already been detailed in the *Dàojīng* [Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*], Chapter Three. I shall not repeat it here.’\n\nThe further one’s origin, the less one knows. The *Zhuàn* states: ‘The *Records* [of Rituals] say: “To govern the world, one must first govern one’s own state; to govern one’s state, one must first rectify one’s household; to rectify one’s household, one must first cultivate one’s self; to cultivate one’s self, one must first regulate one’s heart; to regulate one’s heart, one must first make sincere one’s intentions; to make sincere one’s intentions, one must first extend one’s knowledge.”’ The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘This is the text from the *Records of Rituals·Great Learning*: “The ancients who sought to manifest their **virtue/power** [明德] throughout the world first governed their own states. Those who sought to govern their states first brought order to their families. Those who sought to bring order to their families first cultivated their selves. Those who sought to cultivate their selves first regulated their hearts. Those who sought to regulate their hearts first made sincere their intentions. Those who sought to make sincere their intentions first extended their knowledge.” Knowledge refers to knowing the ultimate origins and ends of good and evil, fortune and misfortune. Extending knowledge lies in investigating things [格物]. **格** [guiding/rectifying], here means **to bring forth** [来]; **物** [things], here refers to **affairs** [事]. When one’s knowledge of the good is profound, good things come forth; when one’s knowledge of the evil is profound, evil things come forth—meaning that affairs arise in accordance with what people favor. **致** [extending] or **至** [reaching] both refer to this. When things are investigated [格], knowledge then reaches [至]; when knowledge reaches, intentions become sincere; when intentions are sincere, the heart is regulated; when the heart is regulated, the self is cultivated; when the self is cultivated, the household is brought into order; when the household is in order, the state is governed; when the state is governed, the world is at peace. From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must take cultivating the self as their foundation. If the foundation is disordered while the branches are in order, it is not so. If one’s priorities are reversed—what is valued becomes slighted and what is slighted becomes valued—this has never occurred. This is called knowing the foundation; this is called knowing the ultimate.\n\n**壹** [One], here means to **focus solely** [专行] on the matter.\n\nThe *Commentary* [疏] explains that “taking cultivating the self as the foundation” means that from the highest Son of Heaven to the lowest commoner, all must take cultivating the self as their foundation, and governing the state as their secondary concern. **否** [not], here means **no**.\n\nNow, **Bìxū** [Spur of the Void] adopts this saying to illustrate that the further one’s origin, the less one knows. But if one turns it inward to reflect upon one’s own self and heart, that is sufficient.\n\nThus, the Sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes. The *Zhuàn* states: ‘Confucius said: “Great indeed is the rule of Yao as a sovereign! Majestic and awe-inspiring, only Heaven is great, only Yao follows it.”’ The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘This is the text from the *Lu Speech·Tai Bo*: “The Master said: Great indeed is the rule of Yao as a sovereign! Majestic and awe-inspiring, only Heaven is great, only Yao follows it. His governance was vast and harmonious, so much so that the people could not name it; yet majestic was his success, and brilliant his accomplishments.”’ **焕** [radiant], here means **illuminated** [明]. His establishment of laws and institutions was also clearly marked.\n\nIt further says: ‘The one who governs through non-action—was it not Shun?’ This is also from the *Lu Speech·Wei Ling Gong*: “The Master said: ‘The one who governs through non-action—was it not Shun?’”\n\nIn truth, the Sages of antiquity who understood the Dao did not need to leave their homes or travel far to know the boundless affairs of the world. They did not need to peer through windows or gaze upward to see the natural patterns of the heavens. Why exert their intentions or contrive actions? Those who could accomplish the non-action of Heaven and Earth, naturally transforming the world, all knew it by reflecting upon their own selves. Hence, it is said: ‘Thus, the Sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes’—this is why.\n\n**For learning, the goal is daily improvement (目益章); for the Dao, the goal is daily reduction (日损).** The *Zhuàn* states: ‘Knowing the child while guarding the mother, returning to the origin and rooting in the foundation.’\n\nThe *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘“Knowing the child while guarding the mother” is the text from the *Classic of Changes·The World Has Its Beginning*: “The child is known, the mother is guarded.”’ Its meaning has already been clarified in the present chapter.\n\nIt further says: ‘“Returning to the origin” is the text from the *Zhuangzi·Nurturing Life*: “Nurture your life in accordance with the common ways, and through the common ways seek to return to your origin. Diminish your desires in accordance with the common ways, and through contemplation seek to reach your clarity.”’ This refers to the enlightened common people [蔽蒙之民].\n\nIt further says: ‘“Rooting in the foundation” is the text from the *Classic of Changes·Extending the Ultimate*: “The root is firm, the foundation is complete.”’ Its meaning is detailed in the present chapter.\n\nNow, if one seeks to return to the origin and root in the foundation, one must first abandon **artificial knowledge** [智], grasp the essential **Dao/Way** [原], and hold fast to the **foundation** [要执本]. “Daily reduction” [日损] means diminishing contrived actions [为], gradually entering into the **mystery/emptiness** [虚妙] of the Dao.\n\nThe world is commonly taken through **non-action** [无事], but when there are contrived actions [有事], it is not sufficient to take the world.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* states: ‘If one governs through contrived actions, the administration becomes burdensome and the people laborious. They stand with heavy steps and glance sideways—then the people will look upon them with fear.’\n\nThe *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘Now, if one seeks to take the world, there is no other method besides making the people’s hearts one’s own. It is natural to follow without opposing, to remain still without moving, to be settled without disturbing. Then the people will find their place, and the world will be without contrived actions. Why is this so?\n\nFrom the *Mencius·Li Lou, Upper Part #2*: “Mencius said: ‘Jie lost the world because he lost his people. He lost his people because he lost their hearts. There is a way to gain the world. Gain its people, and you gain the world. Gain its people by gaining their hearts. Gain their hearts by gathering what they desire and not imposing what they hate. The people’s return is like water flowing downward or beasts fleeing to their dens. Thus, he who digs a well to attract fish is the otter; he who makes a thicket to attract birds is the hawk. Those who attracted the people as fish or birds were Jie and Zhou. If today’s sovereigns have a love for **virtue** [仁], then the feudal lords will all drive [the people] to them. Even if they sing without a king, they cannot be obtained [by force].’”\n\nThe hearts of the people all desire **tranquility** [安], so I remain **still** [静] without disturbing. The hearts of the people all desire **wealth** [富], so I give without taking. The hearts of the people all desire **longevity** [寿], so I nourish without exhausting them [困].」\n\nThe Way to transform is through **wuwei** [無為], to harmonize through **wu shi** [無事], to guide through **ziran** [自然], and thus there will be none who fail to win the people’s hearts.\n\nIf one governs the people with **youwei** [有為], then the people will be disturbed and unable to be still.\nIf one burdens the people with affairs, then the people will be exhausted and unable to find peace.\n\nIt is further said: *\"Those who stand with heavy steps\"*—\nAs recorded in *Shiji’s* *Qin Shihuang Benji*, the Grand Historian remarked: *\"The Qin customs were rife with taboos and prohibitions. Before loyal words could even leave a man’s mouth, his body was already put to death.\"* Thus, the scholars of the realm stood with heavy steps, listening intently, and sealed their mouths, speaking no more. Therefore, three successive rulers lost the Dao, loyal ministers dared not train, wise men dared not plot, and the realm fell into chaos. To govern in this way, yet seek to take the world—it cannot be done.\n\nThe Classic states: *\"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation, hence their hunger. The people’s difficulty in being governed comes from their rulers’ **youwei**, hence their difficulty in being governed.\"*\n\nThus, Bi Xu said: *\"If one governs with **youwei** and burdens the people with affairs, governance becomes cumbersome and the people labored—thus it is insufficient to win the hearts of the people of the world.\"*\n\n*\"Heavy steps\"* means standing with feet together, signifying their inability to find peace.\n\n---\n*(End of annotated manuscript from the Daoist Classic’s hidden chamber, compiled by Zhenwei’s handwritten notes.)*\n\n---\n**Annotations (as per request, though not in final output):**\n- *Wuwei* [無為] / *youwei* [有為] – Contrast of non-action vs. forced action.\n- *Wu shi* [無事] – Literally \"without affairs,\" implying minimal governance.\n- *Ziran* [自然] – \"Self-so,\" the natural order.\n- *Shiji* – *Records of the Grand Historian* (Sima Qian).\n- *Bi Xu* – Likely refers to a Daoist or alchemical figure (context suggests a lost or lesser-known text).\n- *\"Heavy steps\"* – Metaphor for hesitation, fear, or paralysis under oppressive rule.",

      "translated_text": "The *Annotations* state:\n\n*\"The *Records of the Former Han* [前汉列传], Chapter Twenty-Eight, says: Public Son Hong (公孙弘), a native of Xie in the state of Mibo (苜川薛人), during the Fifth Year of Emperor Wu’s reign of *Yuan Guang* (元光), was summoned to the *Examination of the Virtuous and the Learned* (征贤良文学对策). Hong replied: ‘I have heard that when *qi* is harmonized, it follows; when sounds resonate, they respond. If the ruler above harmonizes *virtue* and *power* (和德於上), and the people below are in harmony (百姓和合於下), then the heart’s harmony aligns *qi* (心和则气和), *qi*’s harmony aligns the body (气和则形和), the body’s harmony aligns the voice (形和则声和), and when the voice is harmonized, the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and Earth responds in kind (声和则天地之和应矣). Thus, when yin and yang are harmonized, the winds and rains are timely, sweet dew descends, the five grains flourish, the six domestic animals multiply, the fine millet grows, the red grass sprouts, the mountains do not lose their trees, and the marshes do not dry up—this is the utmost harmony (此和之至也). Therefore, when the body is harmonized, there is no illness; without illness, one does not die young; thus, a father does not lose his son, nor a brother mourn his younger brother. When *virtue/power* aligns with Heaven and Earth and its brilliance matches the sun and moon, then the *lin* and *feng* appear, and auspicious omens come: the *river chart* (河图) emerges from the Yellow River, the *turtle script* (洛书) from the Luo River, and distant rulers all bring tribute, praising *Dao/Way* and offering gifts to pay homage (远方之君，莫不说义奉币而来朝). This is the supreme harmony (此和之极也). It further says: ‘When songs and hymns flourish, there is still something left undone’ (歌谣彰而有以为也).*\n\n*The *Mencius·Wàn Zhāng* [万章] states: ‘Shun served as minister to Yao for twenty-eight years—this was not something human strength could achieve; it was *Dao/Way* (天也). When Yao’s death was complete and the three-year mourning concluded, Shun withdrew to the south of the Nan River (南河之南) to avoid Yao’s son. The people of the realm, when they came to pay homage, went not to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who had disputes went not to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who sang their *zhuó* hymns (枢歌) did not sing them to Yao’s son but to Shun. Hence, it is said: *Dao/Way* (天也). Only then did he enter the Central States (中国) and assume the position of the Son of Heaven (践天子位焉). Now, Bi Xu uses this as his argument, saying: ‘The numinous aligns with yin and yang, the luminous mirrors the sun and moon, the people all revere and obey, together rejoicing in its praise, and when the *lin* and *feng* appear, auspicious omens come’—meaning that when songs and hymns flourish, there is still something left undone (歌彰而有以为也). This confirms the response of ‘The lesser *virtue/power* acts, yet there is something left undone’ (下德为之，而有以为).*\n\n*When *rites* (礼) are performed, yet there is no response, then one will roll up one’s sleeves and force it (攘臂而仍之). The *Annotations* state: ‘*Rites* are *walking the Dao/Way* (履).’ It means to walk the Dao/Way and act accordingly, distinguishing between high and low, establishing noble and ignoble. The *Annotations* further say: ‘*Jade and silk* (玉帛) exchanged in tribute.’ The *Annotations* state: ‘As Confucius said in the *Rites of Lu·Yang Huò* [阳货]: ‘*Rites* say *rites*, but where is the jade and silk? *Music* says *music*, but where are the bells and drums?’ It further says: ‘*威仪* (威仪) exchanged in response.’ The *Analects·Zhōng Yōng* [中庸] states: ‘*Rites* encompass three hundred aspects, *威仪* (威仪) three thousand, and in one word: *revere* (无不敬).’ *Rites* are rooted in *reverence*, *music* in *harmony*; when there is awe-inspiring *威* (威), it is called *威*; when there is *仪* (仪) to follow, it is called *仪*. Jade and silk are the material offerings of *rites*, expressing their intent; bells and drums are the instruments of *music*, guiding its *harmony*. Thus, the essence of *rites* and *music* lies in *reverence* and *harmony*, while jade and silk, bells and drums, are their outward forms. Hence, it says: ‘*Jade and silk exchanged in tribute, awe-inspiring forms in response, raising hands and bowing, advancing and retreating with respectful glances* (玉帛交驰，威仪相答，擎跽曲拳，进退顾揖)—these are the *rites*’ outward flourishes (此礼之文也).’ Therefore, it is said: ‘This is their superficiality (故云末焉).’ If, however, they are exchanged and responded to yet there is no reciprocation, then it will escalate to rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing it (则至於攘臂而仍之也).*\n\n*The *Annotations* state: ‘Confucius said: The greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms (大礼与天地同节).’ This is from the *Records of Rites·Yue Ji* [乐记]. It says: ‘The greatest *music* aligns with Heaven and Earth’s *harmony*, the greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms. *Harmony* ensures all things flourish without harm, and *rhythm* clarifies the offerings to Heaven and Earth, the bright world of *rites* and *music*, and the hidden realm of *ghosts and spirits* (幽则有鬼神).’ The original *Annotations* mistakenly attributed this to *Zhuangzi*, but this is corrected now. It further says: ‘Taking *rites* as wings (以礼为翼), so as to act in the world (所以行於世也者).’ This is from the *Zhuangzi·Dà Zōng Shī* [大宗师]. Having already stated that the greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms, and now taking them as wings to act in the world, how could there ever be the chaos of rolling up one’s sleeves? *Rites*, indeed, are the thinnest expression of *loyalty and trustworthiness* (忠信), yet they are the origin of disorder (而乱之首).*\n\n*The *Annotations* state: ‘*Zhuangzi* said: The Perfect Man practices the *teachings of the Dao/Way* without words (圣人行不言之教云).’ It says: ‘Is it not only the *Great Person* (大人) who does so?’ The *Annotations* state: This is from the *Zhuangzi·Knowing the North* [知北游]. The *Annotations*’ text has already been fully explained, so there is no need to repeat it. In essence, it confirms that *rites* are the outward adornment of the Dao/Way, yet they are the origin of disorder.*\n\n*The *Annotations* further state: ‘*Virtue/Power* (德), *harmony* (和) also, is the utmost *trustworthiness* in action, bearing, and form, aligning with *rites* (顺乎文), which is the *rites* (礼).’ This is from the *Zhuangzi·Refining One’s Nature* [缮性]. The *Annotations*’ text is already complete, so it need not be repeated again. Thus, Bi Xu takes these passages from the *Southern Flowering* (南华) to confirm his arguments, showing that the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi on *virtue/power*, *Dao/Way*, *benevolence and righteousness*, *rites and music*, and *loyalty and trustworthiness* are never disregarded, but rather their proper order and hierarchy are clarified.*\n\n*‘Prior recognition is the Dao/Way’s outward adornment, yet it is the beginning of folly (前识者，道之华，而愚之始).’ The *Annotations* state: ‘Using wisdom to govern the state makes it a thief (以智治国，国之贼).’ This is from the *Sixth Chapter* of the *Classic*. It has already been clarified in this section.*\n\n*The *Annotations* further state: ‘*无思无虑* (No thought, no deliberation)’—this is the language of the *Easy System* (易系). It has already been fully explained earlier.*\n\n*The *Annotations* state: ‘*Excessive rites lead to disorder* (礼烦则乱).’ As the upper text refers to the *Book of Documents·Shuō Mìng* [说命中]: ‘Only in the *Shuō Mìng* did the Hundred Officials gather, and then they presented themselves to the King, saying: ‘Ah! The enlightened ruler follows Heaven’s *Dao/Way* (天道), establishes states and sets up capitals. If he has goodness, he loses his goodness. If he values ability, he loses his *power* (功).’’*",

sovereigns and subjects.\nYet there is a True Sovereign within them.\n\nWhether one attains its essence or fails to do so,\nIt brings no gain nor loss to its authenticity.\n\n*The Compilation* further cites the *Sūtra of the Western Ascension* [西升经]:\n\"When you obtain the One, all affairs are accomplished\"—\nThis has already been explained in the previous passages.\n\n*The Compilation* states: *Zhuāngzǐ* says:\n\"Qi is that which is empty and yet awaits all things.\"\nOnly the Dao gathers this emptiness.\nEmptiness, then, is the essence of *heart-fasting* [心斋].\n\nAgain, it says:\n\"Within the empty hall, purity arises;\nIn stillness, auspiciousness abides.\"\n*The Commentary* notes: These lines are from *Zhuāngzǐ·Rénjiānshì* [庄子·人间世].\n\nYán Huí [颜回] asked Confucius:\n\"Master, my home is poor,\nYet for months I have neither drunk wine nor eaten *ru* [如] meat.\"\nIf this is so, can it be considered *heart-fasting*?\n\nConfucius replied:\n\"This is the *heart-fasting* of sacrifices,\nNot the *heart-fasting* of the heart.\"\nYán Huí asked:\n\"May I inquire about *heart-fasting* of the heart?\"\n\nZhōngní [仲尼] said:\n\"If your will is unified,\nDo not listen with your ears but with your heart,\nNor listen with your heart but with your *qi* [气].\nLet listening cease at the ears,\nAnd let your heart cease at its *symbols* [符].\n*Qi* is that which is empty and yet awaits all things.\nOnly the Dao gathers this emptiness—\nEmptiness is the *heart-fasting* of the heart.\"\n\nYán Huí said:\n\"Before I attained this *use* [使],\nIt was truly from myself alone.\nWhen I attained this *use*,\nI no longer had myself.\nCan this be called emptiness?\"\n\nThe Master [夫子] said:\n\"Exhausted indeed!\nObserve the *unfilled* [阙]:\nWithin the empty hall, purity arises;\nIn stillness, auspiciousness abides.\nYet it does not remain still—\nThis is called *sitting while galloping* [坐驰].\nWhat is sought and verified,\nIs nothing more than this.\"\n\n*The Compilation* further states: \"All things derive their origin\"—\nThis is from the *Yì·Qián* [易·乾卦] *Simu* [彖辞]:\n\"Great indeed is the *Qián* [乾] origin!\nAll things derive their origin from it.\"\n\nAgain, it says: \"All things derive their life\"—\nThis is also from the *Yì·Kūn* [易·坤卦] *Simu* [彖]:\n\"Extreme indeed is the *Kūn* [坤] origin!\nAll things derive their life from it.\n*Kūn* [坤] is vast and bears all things,\nIts virtue harmonizes without bounds.\"\n\n*The Compilation* further states: \"The *Spirit* [神] is that which subtly manifests all things as its words\"—\nThis is from the *Yì·Shuō* [易·说卦] text,\nAlready explained in previous passages.\n\nNow, *Bìqū* [碧虚] takes these several passages\nTo verify the reasoning of *obtaining the One* [得一].\n\nThe so-called *One* [一] is the *original qi* [元气].\nThis *original qi* can be both *yin* [阴] and *yang* [阳],\nYet it does not belong to either *yin* or *yang*.\nIt ascends to the *Jīng* [京] of Jade and the *Gold Gate* [金阙],\nYet it is not taken as *clear* [清].\nIt dwells in the *cracked earth* [瓦号] of *Lì* [荔] and *Suì* [薜],\nYet it is not taken as *impure* [浊].\n\nThe *Qián* [乾] origin uses it to derive its beginning,\nThe *Kūn* [坤] origin uses it to derive its life.\nWhen it governs and controls the *manifested* [有为],\nThen the True Sovereign emerges.\nWhen it is motionless and still,\nThen the True Sovereign appears.\n\nBy its utmost emptiness, it becomes the root of all life;\nBy its utmost fewness, it becomes the ancestor of all things.\nThose who attain this:\nNothing fails to be born,\nNo affair fails to be accomplished,\nThus it is said: *Heaven obtains the One to remain clear* [天得一以清].\n\n*The Compilation* states:\nEven the *feudal lords and kings* [侯王], attaining this,\nAre able to perpetually possess the *Great Treasure* [大宝],\nWithout thought, all submit.\nThus they bring peace and rectitude to the world.\n\n*The Commentary* notes: \"Without thought, all submit\"—\nThis is from the *Máo Shī* [毛诗] *Dàyǎ·Wénwángyǒushēngpiān* [大雅·文王有声篇]:\n\"Hào [镐] and Jīng [京] were divided and settled,\nFrom the west to the east,\nFrom the south to the north,\nWithout thought, all submit—\nGreat King, your virtue is indeed vast!\"\n\nIt says: \"Great King, your virtue is indeed vast!\"\n*Huáng* [皇] means *great* [大],\n*Zhēng* [烝] means *sovereign* [君].\nThis praises Wǔwáng [武王] for his great virtue and sovereign power.\n\nNow *Bìqū* cites this to say:\nThat when Wǔwáng [武王] performed the *pìyōng* [辟雍] rites at Hào [镐] and Jīng [京],\nHe inspired awe and submission from all four directions,\nAll nations fearing and yielding—\nThis was also due to his attainment of the One and its rectification.\n\nThus it is said: *Feudal lords and kings obtain the One to rectify the world* [侯王得一以为天下正].\n\nHeaven, without its *clearness* [清], would fear *cleavage* [裂];\nEarth, without its *tranquility* [宁], would fear *upheaval* [发];\nThe *Spirit* [神], without its *responsiveness* [灵], would fear *extinction* [歇];\nThe *valleys* [谷], without their *fullness* [盈], would fear *exhaustion* [竭];\nAll things, without their *life* [生], would fear *annihilation* [灭];\nFeudal lords and kings, without *uprightness* [贞] and *nobility* [贵高], would fear *overthrow* [蹶].\n\nThus, *nobility* is rooted in *humility* [贱],\nAnd *height* is based on *lowliness* [基].\nHence, feudal lords and kings call themselves *orphan* [孤],\n*widower* [寡], and *not-grain* [不谷]—\nThis is their way of taking *humility* as the root,\nIs it not?\n\n*The Compilation* states: \"When *yin* and *yang* are disordered.\"\n*The Commentary* notes: This is from the *Wénzǐ·Shànglǐ* [文子·上礼] text:\n\"When *yin* and *yang* are disordered,\nThe four seasons lose their sequence,\nThunder and lightning are destroyed and broken,\nFrost and hail bring harm,\nAnd all things wither and perish.\nThe full passage has already been recorded in the *Dàodéjīng* [道经], the thirty-first chapter, in detail.\n\nAgain, it says: \"Yet the *Spirit* [神] is the *yin* and *yang* that cannot be measured\"—\nThis has also been explained in previous passages.\n\n*The Compilation* states:\nThus, the *drying up of the Luo* [锥] led to the decline of Xià [夏],\nAnd the *drying up of the Hé* [河] caused the fall of Shāng [商].\n\n*The Commentary* notes: The *Shǐjì·Zhōuběnjì* [史记·周本纪] states:\n\"In the second year of Yōuwáng [幽王], the three rivers of the Western Zhou [西周] all trembled.\nThe Western Zhou refers to Hào [镐] and Jīng [京].\nThe three rivers are the *Jīng* [泾], *Wèi* [渭], and *Luo* [洛].\nBóyángfǔ [伯阳父] said: 'The Zhou shall perish.'\nBóyángfǔ was the aged *Zhūxiàshǐ* [柱下史] Laozi of the Zhou.\n\nThe *qi* of Heaven and Earth does not lose its order.\nIf it exceeds its order, the people will be in chaos.\nWhen *yang* is suppressed and cannot emerge,\nAnd *yin* is oppressed and cannot nourish,\nThen there is an earthquake.\nNow the three rivers truly trembled—\nThis is *yang* losing its place and subduing *yin*.\nWhen *yang* is lost within *yin*,\nThe *source* [原] must be blocked,\nAnd when the *source* is blocked, the state must perish.\n\nThe water and soil nourish the people,\n*Nourishment* [演] being *moistening* [润].\nWhen the soil lacks nourishment,\nThe people lack resources,\nWhat more awaits them than ruin?\n\nIn the past, when the *Luo* [伊洛] dried up, Xià [夏] perished.\nYǔ [禹] settled at *Yángchéng* [阳城],\nNear the *Luo* [伊洛].\nWhen the *Hé* [河] dried up, Shāng [商] perished.\nThe Shāng people settled at *Wèi* [卫],\nWhere the *Hé* [河] flowed.\"",

state.\nWhen rivers dry up, mountains must collapse—\nIf a state falls, it will not exceed ten years,\nThis is the measure of **fate** [数].\n\nWhat the **Heaven** [天] abandons does not exceed its

honored?\nHow does one know what is truly dishonored?'\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way** [道] of forgetting honor and dishonor,\nYet able to preserve the **\"Uncarved\"** [冲] **\"One\"** [一],\nAnd to

movement** [天行].\n'It is beneficial to have a place of return,'\nFor the strong are long-lasting.\n'Fù' [复] reveals the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地].\n\nThis is the time when **One** [一] **yang** [阳] first emerges.\n\n**Bào Jí** [鲍极] **Jié** [解] says:\n'The foundation of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地] lies in the **Original One** [一元].\nThe **qi** [气] of the **Original

contains the **Tàijí** [太极] **radiance** [熙].\n\nIts **substance** [体] is **stillness** [静],\nIts **function** [用] is **movement** [动],\nThus it can govern the four seasons,\nAnd transform and nourish all things—\nThis is the reason why it is said to be **serene yet unmoving** [寂然不动],\nYet **responsive** [感] and **penetrating** [遂] to all under **Heaven** [天].\n\nWhen **movement** [动] ceases, it becomes **stillness** [静],\nAnd when **stillness** [静] is restored, it returns to its **Original One** [元].\nThis occurs in the **Jiànzǐ** [建子] **month** [月], when the **Three** [三] is contained within **One** [一].\n\nWhen **stillness** [静] ceases, it becomes **movement** [动],\nAnd when **movement** [动] is displayed, its **function** [用] is revealed.\nThe **end** [终] returns to the **beginning** [始],\nAnd **generation** [生] continues without limit—\nThe **Dao/Way** [道] is found within this.\n\nWhen **One** [一] is central, it endures long,\nAnd when it endures long, it changes.\nThus, through **movement** [动] we perceive **stillness** [静],\nAnd through **function** [用] we perceive **substance** [体].\nThis means that **substance** [体] is not merely **stillness** [静],\nFor it is categorized by **movement** [动],\nYet its **stillness** [静] is seen.\n\n**Stillness** [静] is the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地].\nThus the **sage** [圣人] embodies the **Original One** [元]\nTo establish their **sincerity** [诚],\nWith **stillness** [静] as their **nature** [性],\nAnd with **movement** [动] as their **transformation** [化],\nSo they do not exert themselves yet achieve harmony,\nNor think yet attain understanding,\nAnd thus align with **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地] in their **virtue/power** [德].\n\nThose who can **shape** [造] form and **awaken** [悟]\nYet seek to return to the **Original One** [元] are **accomplished** [贤].\nThus, the **Original One** [元] is the foundation of the **sage** [圣],\nAnd the **return** [复] is the foundation of the **accomplished** [贤],\nYet the **initial nine** [初九] of the *Yì* [易] was grasped by **Yán Shì** [颜氏].\n\n**Yán Shì** [颜氏] grasped it,\nFor the *Yì·Xià* [易下击] states:\n*\"The noble

it means.\"*\n\nThus **\"return\"** [复] is not the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地],\nBut rather the ability to perceive it.\n\n**Zhū Huì’ān** [朱晦庵] said:\n*\"Under accumulated **yin** [阴], **One** [一] **yang** [阳] emerges to return,\nRevealing the **heart** [心] of **generation** [生]—\nIn humans, this is **stillness** [静] reaching its peak and then **movement** [动],\nAnd

Can I hear the explanation?”\n\n**Gèzǐ** [告子] replied:\n“If you cannot grasp it through words, do not demand it of the **heart**.\nIf you cannot grasp it in the **heart**, do not demand it of the **qi**.\nIf you cannot grasp it in the **heart**, do not demand it of the **qi**, then [you may proceed].\nIf you cannot grasp it through words, do not demand it of the **heart**, then [you cannot].\n\n“The **志** *zhì* is the **qi**’s commander.\nThe **qi** fills the **body** [体].\nThe **heart** and **志** are where thoughts and deliberations arise.\nThe **qi** is what fills and satisfies the form and body, giving rise to joy and anger.\nThe **志** commands the **qi** and sets it in motion, determining its suitability or not.\nWhen the **志** is set, the **qi** follows.\nThe **志** is the most essential foundation, while the **qi** follows and adapts to it.\nHence it is said: **Hold fast to your志, and do not let your qi rage** [持其志，无暴其气].\n*Bào* [暴] means disorder.\nIt means that when the **志** is directed, the **qi** will follow—so one must firmly hold to the **志**, lest it be disordered, and then the **qi** will remain stable, allowing joy and anger to act upon others.\n\nHaving said, “The **志** is set, the **qi** follows,”\nAnd also, “**Hold fast to your志, and do not let your qi rage**,”\nWhy is this so?\n\nIt is because:\nWhen the **志** is unified, it moves the **qi**,\nAnd when the **qi** is unified, it moves the **志**.\n*Chá* [查] means stagnant and unexpressed.\nNow, those who hurry and rush—\nThis is their **qi**, yet it turns back and disturbs their **heart**.\n**Mèngzǐ** spoke of how a person’s **志** and **qi** become confined and stagnant, thus unified.\nWhen the **志** is confined, the **qi** cannot move freely,\nAnd when the **qi** is confined, the **志** cannot express itself.\nThose who now walk with a furrowed brow—\nIt is because their **qi** is blocked and they cannot control themselves,\nSo their **志** and **qi** become inverted.\nBetween inversion and stagnation, there is no way to avoid movement and fear.\n\nThus, the **志** and **qi** assist each other.\nMay I ask how the Master excels?\n\nThe Master replied:\n“I know how to speak, and I am skilled at nurturing my **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**.”\n\nMay I ask what is meant by **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**?\n\nThe Master replied:\n“It is hard to explain.\nThis **qi** is supremely vast and robust,\nNurtured with uprightness and without harm,\nThen it fills the space between heaven and earth.\nThis **qi**, when aligned with **righteousness** [义] and the **Dao/Way** [道],\nLacks it, and it withers.\nThis is the **qi** born from gathering **righteousness** [义],\nNot seized by **righteousness** clinging to it.\n*Jí* [集] means intermingling.\nIt means that **浩然** *hàorán* **qi** arises naturally from its mingling with **righteousness** [仁义],\nNot from artificially applying **righteousness** to take it.\nHence it is said: “This **qi** is born from gathering **righteousness**,\nNot seized by **righteousness** clinging to it.”\nIf one’s actions do not conform to the **heart**’s intent,\nThen it withers.\n*Zhuàn* [赚] means swift and harmonious.\nWhen one reflects inwardly and finds that their practice of **righteousness** [仁义] is incomplete,\nHarming the **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**,\nThen they suffer from a gnawing hunger in their chest.\nHence, things may either be lost to gain or gained to lose.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n“Those who humble themselves to cultivate their **virtue** [德].”\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n“This is the *Yì·Tiǎn* [《易·谦卦》] initial sixth line’s text.\nIt has been repeatedly explained before, so it will not be repeated here.”\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n“Through humility, one receives benefit.”\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n“The *Shàngshū·Dàyǔ Mó* [《尚书·大禹谟》] states:\n‘**Yǐ** [益] praised **Yǔ** [禹], saying:\n“Only **virtue/power** moves heaven,\nReaching even the most distant without fail.\nFullness invites loss, humility invites gain—\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of heaven.”\n\nNow, **Bìxū** [碧虚] takes from *Lìzǐ* [《列子》] the passage where **qi** and form are complete yet undivided,\nHence it says: *“The undivided”* [浑沦], to illustrate the meaning of the **Dao/Way** giving rise to unity.\nAgain, it takes **Mèngzǐ**’s *“浩然”* [浩然] to illustrate the meaning of the **Harmonizing Qi** completing all things.\nAgain, it takes the *Yì* [《易》]’s *“谦卦”* [Tiǎn Coordinate] passage *“Through humility, one cultivates oneself”* [卑以自牧],\nAnd the *Shū* [《书》]’s *“Dàyǔ Mó”* [《大禹谟》] passage *“Through humility, one receives benefit”* [以谦受益],\nTo illustrate the meaning of *“Things may either be lost to gain or gained to lose”*.\nFinally, it concludes with *“The strong **粱** [strong grain] cannot find its proper end”* [强粱者不得其死],\nAnd I will take this as my **teacher** [教父],\nWhose sincere admonitions and exhortations to the world are profound indeed.\n\n**Chapter 43: The Ultimate Softness of the World** [天下之至柔]\n*Wúyǒu* [无有] enters into *wújiàn* [无间].\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] says:\n“**Zhuāngzǐ** [庄子] said:\n‘Gold and stone cannot be pierced—\nWithout them, there is nothing to resound.’\n\nThe *Chāo* [钞] says:\n*The *Zhuāngzǐ·Tiāndì* [《庄子·天地篇》] states:\n“The Master said:\n‘The **Dao/Way** [道] dwells deep within—\nIts sound is vast and clear.\nGold and stone cannot be pierced—\nWithout them, there is nothing to resound.\nGold and stone have sound,\nBut without striking, they cannot resound.\nWho among all things can truly stabilize them?’\n\nNow, **Bìxū** [碧虚] uses this to explain:\nThat gold and stone are firm and impenetrable objects.\nYet when struck, they produce sound—\nThis is because they internally harbor **Dao/Way qi** [道气], making them so.\nThe **Dao/Way qi** is *wúyǒu* [无有].\nGold and stone are *wújiàn* [无间].\nNow, this **Dao/Way** of emptiness and void,\nAble to enter gold and stone,\nIs it not precisely *wúyǒu* entering *wújiàn*?\n\nI have heard in *The Book of Transformation·Dao/Way of Transformation* [《化书·道化篇》]:\n‘The dragon died on **Chǒuyáng Shān** [首阳之山].\nThe distinction between reality and illusion is so clear.’\n\nThe *Zhuàn* [纂] further says:\n“Yet those who are **悠悠** *yōuyōu* [lofty and detached] rush after fame without end—\nAre they merely caught between leisure and suffering, joy and pain?\nThis is also from *The Yáng Zhū Pian* [《扬朱篇》].\n**Chángzǐ** [常子] said:\n‘Abandon the **命令** *mìnglìng* [fixed rules], and there will be no suffering.’\n**Lǎozǐ** [老子] said:\n‘**Name** [名] is the **guest** of the **real** [实].’\nYet those who are **悠悠** *yōuyōu* [lofty and detached] rush after fame without end—\nHow can **Name** be abandoned?\nHow can **Name** be a **guest** of the **real**?\n\nNow, having a **Name** brings honor and respect,\nLacking a **Name** brings disgrace and shame.\nHonor and respect bring leisure and joy,\nDisgrace and shame bring suffering and pain.\nSuffering and pain are what offend one’s **nature** [性],\nWhile leisure and joy are what align with one’s **nature**.\nThis is where the **real** is tied!\n\nHow can **Name** be abandoned?\nHow can **Name** be a **guest** of the **real**?\nOnly that

      "translated_text": "The *Zhuàn* further states: The likes of Bào Jiāo and Zǐ Tuī were those who clung to **Name** and burdened the **real**.\n\nThe *Jiǎo* [钞] explains: Bào Jiāo and Zǐ Tuī—\nThe *Zhuāngzi·Táo Zhí* [盗跖] chapter states: *\"Bào Jiāo adorned his conduct beyond the world’s norms, embracing death by clinging to a tree. His surname was Bào, given name Jiāo, a recluse of the Zhou era. He adorned his conduct beyond the world’s norms; maintaining purity and integrity, he carried burdens, gathered firewood, and gathered acorns for sustenance. He did not serve the Son of Heaven nor associate with feudal lords. Zǐ Gòng encountered him and said, ‘I have heard that one should not tread upon lands whose governance one disapproves, nor accept benefits from a ruler one deems corrupt. Yet you walk upon this land and consume its benefits—is this acceptable?’ Bào Jiāo replied, ‘I have heard that a virtuous man values advancement but scorns retreat, that the worthy are easily shamed but lightly regard death.’ Thus, he embraced the tree and withered away.\"*\n\nJìe Zǐ Tuī was the epitome of loyalty, having cut his own thigh to feed Wén Gōng. Later, when Wén Gōng betrayed him, Zǐ Tuī departed in anger, embracing a tree until he perished in flames.\n\nIn the past, when Jìn Wén Gōng (Zhòng Ēr) was young, he faced the hardship of his stepmother Lì Jī’s plot. Lì Jī’s son was Yí Jiù. She sought to dethrone Zhòng Ēr and establish Yí Jiù, repeatedly slandering him to Xiàn Gōng. The king believed her, and Zhòng Ēr fled into exile. Along the way, starving, Zǐ Tuī cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Wén Gōng. Later, when Zhòng Ēr returned to ascend the throne as Wén Gōng, he rewarded his followers but forgot Zǐ Tuī. The latter composed the *Lóngshé* [龙蛇] song, inscribed it on the camp gate, and departed in fury. The king then regretted his neglect and pursued Zǐ Tuī to Jiè Shān—also called Mián Shān. When Zǐ Tuī refused to emerge, the king set the mountain ablaze. Though flames surrounded him, he did not flee but perished, clinging to a tree.\n\nNow, Bìxū [碧虚] discusses these two men as examples of those who clung to **Name** and burdened the **real**.\n\nBetween **body** and wealth, which is more burdensome?\nThe *Zhuàn* states: The wealthy toil endlessly, amassing riches they cannot fully enjoy—thus, their **body** is enslaved externally. The noble labor night and day, fretting over right and wrong—thus, their **body** is neglected.\n\nThe *Jiǎo* [钞] cites the *Zhuāngzi·Zhì Lè* [至乐] chapter: *\"What the world esteems are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful women, melodious music. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice. What it suffers are bodily discomfort, lack of delicacies, unattractive attire, unpleasing sights, and discordant sounds. If these are denied, great anxiety and fear arise. Thus, the **body** is treated as a mere tool.\"*\n\nThe wealthy toil endlessly, amassing riches they cannot fully enjoy—thus, their **body** is enslaved externally. The noble labor night and day, fretting over right and wrong—thus, their **body** is neglected. Human life is born with sorrow; the long-lived grow dull, enduring prolonged suffering without end—how far their **body** is from true ease!\n\nFrom this perspective, the wealthy and noble pursue **Name** and sacrifice for gain, bearing lifelong sorrow and knowing no true joy. Thus, Bìxū [碧虚] cites this to illustrate which is more burdensome—**body** or wealth.\n\nBetween gain and loss, which brings greater affliction?\nThe *Zhuàn* states: Zhuāngzi said, *\"Those who cultivate their **mind** forget the **body**; those who nourish the **body** forget gain; those who attain the **Dao** forget the **heart**.\"*\n\nThe *Jiǎo* [钞] explains: This is from the *Zhuāngzi·Ràng Wáng* [让王] chapter: *\"Zēngzǐ, residing in Wèi, wore tattered robes with no lining, his face swollen and discolored. His hands and feet were calloused, and for three days he did not light a fire; for ten years, he did not mend his clothes. His hat’s ribbon frayed, his sleeves were threadbare, and his sandals were worn through. Dragging his tattered garments, he sang the *Shāng Sòng* hymns, his voice filling heaven and earth like chimes and bells. Neither the Son of Heaven could command him as a subject nor feudal lords as a friend. Thus, those who cultivate their **mind** forget the **body**; those who nourish the **body** forget gain; those who attain the **Dao** forget the **heart**.\"*\n\nHere, the *Zhuàn* further cites two passages from the *Zhuāngzi·Ràng Wáng* chapter—both complete in themselves—without need of repetition, to illustrate which brings greater affliction: gain or loss, and the meaning of *\"knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Dàchéng Ruò Quē [大成若缺]**\nGreat completion resembles deficiency,\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness,\nIts use is boundless.",

      "translated_text": "「The *Zhuàn* says: *\"He who gazes upon turbid waters and loses himself in clear springs.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"This is from the *Zhuāngzǐ·Shān Mù* chapter.\"* **Zhuāng Zhou** wandered in the **Diāolíng** wilderness, where he saw a strange crow from the southern lands—its wingspan seven feet wide, its eyes as large as a *yùn* measure (inch), drawn to his scent and alighting in the **Lìlín**. Zhuāng Zhou said: *\"What kind of bird is this? Its vast wings do not soar, and its great eyes do not perceive.\"* He raised his hem and quickened his steps, plucked a pebble and hurled it, causing the crow to retreat. He saw a cicada, basking in the fine shade and forgetting its own body; the mantis seized its wings and struck at it, seeing its prey and forgetting its own form; the strange crow swooped down to take advantage, seeing profit and forgetting its true nature. Zhuāng Zhou sighed and said: *\"Alas! Things are indeed bound to one another, and the two types call to each other.\"* He discarded the pebble and turned back, but the **Yúrén** (keeper of wildfowl) pursued him, criticizing his actions and questioning his motives. Zhuāng Zhou returned home, and for three months he did not attend court. **Lán Qiè** and **Zǐyú** came to ask him: *\"Master, why have you been so absent from court these days?\"* Zhuāng Zhou replied: *\"I have preserved my form and forgotten my body, gazing upon turbid waters and losing myself in clear springs. Moreover, I have heard from my teacher that, ‘Enter their customs, follow their ways.’ Now I wander in the **Diāolíng** wilderness and forget my own body; the strange crow is drawn to my scent, alighting in the **Lìlín** and forgetting its true nature, while the **Yúrén** of **Lìlín** takes me as their quarry. Hence, I have not attended court.\"* Now taking this as a parable, it is said that those who are bewildered by desire rarely escape its punishments. Just as Zhuāng Zhou wandered in the **Diāolíng** wilderness, gazing upon turbid waters and losing himself in clear springs. Therefore, **Bìxū** (the Daoist sage) says: *\"No greater calamity than seeking what one desires.\"* The *Zhuàn* further says: *\"There is none left untouched.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"Referring to the *Máo Shī·Dàyǎ·Yún Hàn* chapter, which states: ‘The Milky Way follows the Chou Duke, follows the Chou Duke, the great official of the Zhou.’ It praises King Xuan of Zhou. When the drought was severe, it could not be dispelled, and he worked tirelessly in fear, like thunder and lightning, saving the people of Zhou—none were left untouched. Here, ‘dispelled’ means ‘removed.’ ‘Tirelessly’ signifies ‘dread,’ and ‘dangerous’ denotes ‘fear.’ It says that King Xuan of Zhou, anxious about the excessive drought of his time, labored tirelessly in dread, like thunder and lightning striking overhead, so that none of his people were left alone to escape the calamity. Now **Bìxū** takes this ‘none left untouched’ to mean otherwise. He blames those who covet all things under heaven, whether seen or unseen, desiring to possess them all, leaving none untouched, so that everything is under their control—this is no greater excess than their insatiable greed. How much less can it be confined to harming just one person? This calamity must surely extend to their descendants and future generations. Hence, it is said: *‘No greater calamity than seeking what one desires.’* Chapter Forty-Seven: *\"Knowing the world without leaving one’s door.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* says: *\"When one eats, he thinks of those who hunger in the world; when one clothes himself, he thinks of those who shiver in the world. Loving his own elders, he knows of the aged everywhere; pitying his own children, he knows of the young everywhere.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"The *Mèngzǐ·Lí Lóu* chapter states: ‘Yú (the Great Yu) and Jì (the Patriarch of Agriculture) lived in peaceful times, yet passed their doors three times before entering. The Master (Confucius) praised them. Yán Zǐ (Yan Hui) lived in turbulent times, dwelling in a humble lane, eating from a single basket of rice, drinking from a single gourd, while others could not bear his hardships—Yán Zǐ remained unchanged in his joy. The Master praised him.’ Mèngzǐ said: ‘Yú, Jì, and Yán Hui share the same Dao. Yú thought of those drowning in the world as if they were himself drowning. Jì thought of those starving in the world as if they were himself starving. Great Yú governed the world’s floods, and Hou Jì taught the world to sow and cultivate. Hence, their urgency was so great. Yú, Jì, and Yán Zǐ shared the same Dao, and if their positions were exchanged, they would act likewise. Moreover, the *Mèngzǐ·Liáng Huì Wáng* chapter states: ‘Revere my elders as I do my own; extend this reverence to all elders. Love my children as I do my own; extend this love to all children. Then the world may be governed as if it were in the palm of my hand.’ All this is the Dao of observing oneself to understand one’s family, and one’s family to understand the world. How much more so is it the Dao of observing oneself to understand the world! If one can do this, why must he wait to leave his door before knowing the world?\"*\n\n*\"Seeing the Dao without peering through windows.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuàn* says: *\"The sovereign (ruler) aligns himself with the **Èr Yí** (Two Principles: Heaven and Earth) in virtue, and with the sun and moon in radiance. He precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose him; he follows Heaven, and he conforms to the Heavenly order.\"* The *Chāo* notes: *\"The *Yì·Xiān·Kàn* (Commentary on the *Kàn* Hexagram of the *Yìjīng*) states: ‘The great person aligns himself with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in radiance, with the four seasons in their sequence, and with spirits and gods in their blessings and omens. He precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose him; he follows Heaven, and he conforms to the Heavenly order.’ It says that if one acts before the Heavenly order, the Dao will comply and not oppose. If one acts after the Heavenly order, one must conform to the Dao and not dare to defy it. Now if a ruler can do this, the Dao will be clear without his need to peer through windows or gaze afar. Moreover, I have heard that **Shào Yáo Fú** composed a poem: ‘One thing originates from one self, one self contains one heaven and earth. Knowing all things are complete within me, why set the Three Realms apart? Heaven divides creation from the One, while man weaves schemes from the heart. Heaven and man share no dual purpose—Dao acts without deception, only through man.’ This may be called ‘seeing the Dao without peering through windows.’ The *Zhuàn* further says: ‘Hence, those who understand the sayings of death and life—*the Yì·Shàng Xì* states: ‘He looks upward to observe the celestial patterns, and downward to examine the earthly features, thus knowing the reasons behind the hidden and the manifest.’\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Returning to the origin and reflecting upon the end, one thus understands the sayings of death and life. This is what is meant by them.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* further cites **Yán Jūn Píng** as saying: ‘Those who extinguish the Three Five [cycles]—this meaning has already been detailed in the *Dàojīng* [Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*], Chapter Three. I shall not repeat it here.’\n\nThe further one’s origin, the less one knows. The *Zhuàn* states: ‘The *Records* [of Rituals] say: “To govern the world, one must first govern one’s own state; to govern one’s state, one must first rectify one’s household; to rectify one’s household, one must first cultivate one’s self; to cultivate one’s self, one must first regulate one’s heart; to regulate one’s heart, one must first make sincere one’s intentions; to make sincere one’s intentions, one must first extend one’s knowledge.”’ The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘This is the text from the *Records of Rituals·Great Learning*: “The ancients who sought to manifest their **virtue/power** [明德] throughout the world first governed their own states. Those who sought to govern their states first brought order to their families. Those who sought to bring order to their families first cultivated their selves. Those who sought to cultivate their selves first regulated their hearts. Those who sought to regulate their hearts first made sincere their intentions. Those who sought to make sincere their intentions first extended their knowledge.” Knowledge refers to knowing the ultimate origins and ends of good and evil, fortune and misfortune. Extending knowledge lies in investigating things [格物]. **格** [guiding/rectifying], here means **to bring forth** [来]; **物** [things], here refers to **affairs** [事]. When one’s knowledge of the good is profound, good things come forth; when one’s knowledge of the evil is profound, evil things come forth—meaning that affairs arise in accordance with what people favor. **致** [extending] or **至** [reaching] both refer to this. When things are investigated [格], knowledge then reaches [至]; when knowledge reaches, intentions become sincere; when intentions are sincere, the heart is regulated; when the heart is regulated, the self is cultivated; when the self is cultivated, the household is brought into order; when the household is in order, the state is governed; when the state is governed, the world is at peace. From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must take cultivating the self as their foundation. If the foundation is disordered while the branches are in order, it is not so. If one’s priorities are reversed—what is valued becomes slighted and what is slighted becomes valued—this has never occurred. This is called knowing the foundation; this is called knowing the ultimate.\n\n**壹** [One], here means to **focus solely** [专行] on the matter.\n\nThe *Commentary* [疏] explains that “taking cultivating the self as the foundation” means that from the highest Son of Heaven to the lowest commoner, all must take cultivating the self as their foundation, and governing the state as their secondary concern. **否** [not], here means **no**.\n\nNow, **Bìxū** [Spur of the Void] adopts this saying to illustrate that the further one’s origin, the less one knows. But if one turns it inward to reflect upon one’s own self and heart, that is sufficient.\n\nThus, the Sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes. The *Zhuàn* states: ‘Confucius said: “Great indeed is the rule of Yao as a sovereign! Majestic and awe-inspiring, only Heaven is great, only Yao follows it.”’ The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘This is the text from the *Lu Speech·Tai Bo*: “The Master said: Great indeed is the rule of Yao as a sovereign! Majestic and awe-inspiring, only Heaven is great, only Yao follows it. His governance was vast and harmonious, so much so that the people could not name it; yet majestic was his success, and brilliant his accomplishments.”’ **焕** [radiant], here means **illuminated** [明]. His establishment of laws and institutions was also clearly marked.\n\nIt further says: ‘The one who governs through non-action—was it not Shun?’ This is also from the *Lu Speech·Wei Ling Gong*: “The Master said: ‘The one who governs through non-action—was it not Shun?’”\n\nIn truth, the Sages of antiquity who understood the Dao did not need to leave their homes or travel far to know the boundless affairs of the world. They did not need to peer through windows or gaze upward to see the natural patterns of the heavens. Why exert their intentions or contrive actions? Those who could accomplish the non-action of Heaven and Earth, naturally transforming the world, all knew it by reflecting upon their own selves. Hence, it is said: ‘Thus, the Sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes’—this is why.\n\n**For learning, the goal is daily improvement (目益章); for the Dao, the goal is daily reduction (日损).** The *Zhuàn* states: ‘Knowing the child while guarding the mother, returning to the origin and rooting in the foundation.’\n\nThe *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘“Knowing the child while guarding the mother” is the text from the *Classic of Changes·The World Has Its Beginning*: “The child is known, the mother is guarded.”’ Its meaning has already been clarified in the present chapter.\n\nIt further says: ‘“Returning to the origin” is the text from the *Zhuangzi·Nurturing Life*: “Nurture your life in accordance with the common ways, and through the common ways seek to return to your origin. Diminish your desires in accordance with the common ways, and through contemplation seek to reach your clarity.”’ This refers to the enlightened common people [蔽蒙之民].\n\nIt further says: ‘“Rooting in the foundation” is the text from the *Classic of Changes·Extending the Ultimate*: “The root is firm, the foundation is complete.”’ Its meaning is detailed in the present chapter.\n\nNow, if one seeks to return to the origin and root in the foundation, one must first abandon **artificial knowledge** [智], grasp the essential **Dao/Way** [原], and hold fast to the **foundation** [要执本]. “Daily reduction” [日损] means diminishing contrived actions [为], gradually entering into the **mystery/emptiness** [虚妙] of the Dao.\n\nThe world is commonly taken through **non-action** [无事], but when there are contrived actions [有事], it is not sufficient to take the world.\n\nThe *Zhuàn* states: ‘If one governs through contrived actions, the administration becomes burdensome and the people laborious. They stand with heavy steps and glance sideways—then the people will look upon them with fear.’\n\nThe *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘Now, if one seeks to take the world, there is no other method besides making the people’s hearts one’s own. It is natural to follow without opposing, to remain still without moving, to be settled without disturbing. Then the people will find their place, and the world will be without contrived actions. Why is this so?\n\nFrom the *Mencius·Li Lou, Upper Part #2*: “Mencius said: ‘Jie lost the world because he lost his people. He lost his people because he lost their hearts. There is a way to gain the world. Gain its people, and you gain the world. Gain its people by gaining their hearts. Gain their hearts by gathering what they desire and not imposing what they hate. The people’s return is like water flowing downward or beasts fleeing to their dens. Thus, he who digs a well to attract fish is the otter; he who makes a thicket to attract birds is the hawk. Those who attracted the people as fish or birds were Jie and Zhou. If today’s sovereigns have a love for **virtue** [仁], then the feudal lords will all drive [the people] to them. Even if they sing without a king, they cannot be obtained [by force].’”\n\nThe hearts of the people all desire **tranquility** [安], so I remain **still** [静] without disturbing. The hearts of the people all desire **wealth** [富], so I give without taking. The hearts of the people all desire **longevity** [寿], so I nourish without exhausting them [困].」",

Before loyal words could even leave a man’s mouth, his body was already put to death.\"* Thus, the scholars of the realm stood with heavy steps, listening intently, and sealed their mouths, speaking no more. Therefore, three successive rulers lost the Dao, loyal ministers dared not train, wise men dared not plot, and the realm fell into chaos. To govern in this way, yet seek to take the world—it cannot be done.\n\nThe Classic states: *\"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation, hence their hunger. The people’s difficulty in being governed comes from their rulers’ **youwei**, hence their difficulty in being governed.\"*\n\nThus, Bi Xu said: *\"If one governs with **youwei** and burdens the people with affairs, governance becomes cumbersome and the people labored—thus it is insufficient to win the hearts of the people of the world.\"*\n\n*\"Heavy steps\"* means standing with feet together, signifying their inability to find peace.\n\n---\n*(End of annotated manuscript from the Daoist Classic’s hidden chamber, compiled by Zhenwei’s handwritten notes.)*\n\n---\n**Annotations (as per request, though not in final output):**\n- *Wuwei* [無為] / *youwei* [有為] – Contrast of non-action vs. forced action.\n- *Wu shi* [無事] – Literally \"without affairs,\" implying minimal governance.\n- *Ziran* [自然] – \"Self-so,\" the natural order.\n- *Shiji* – *Records of the Grand Historian* (Sima Qian).\n- *Bi Xu* – Likely refers to a Daoist or alchemical figure (context suggests a lost or lesser-known text).\n- *\"Heavy steps\"* – Metaphor for hesitation, fear, or paralysis under oppressive rule.",
