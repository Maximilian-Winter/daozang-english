  "full_translation": "**The Second Interpretation of the Dao De Jing**\n\n**Title:** *Second Interpretation of the Dao De Jing*.\n**Attributed to:** Anonymous author of the Tang Dynasty.\n**In two volumes.** The source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of Orthodox Daoism), under the *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Divinity) section, *Yùjué* (Jade Precepts) category.\n**Note:** The original *Dao De Jing* lacks chapter divisions; these were added by the editor.\n\n**Preface to the Second Interpretation of the Dao De Jing**\n\n**Statement:** Though matters are myriad in their forms, their principles converge into one.\nThe Three Teachings share a common foundation, yet their doctrines arise from countless schools.\nAll seek to uphold antiquity while preserving the present,\nto exhaust all falsehood and return to the true.\nNone fail to mark the fundamental cycles, to hint at their origins,\nwishing to make the right right and the wrong wrong,\nthe white white and the black black.\n\nYet even as the pure winds of antiquity have faded,\nthe Dao of Heaven remains the same.\nAll sages follow in its wake,\nand all virtuous scholars stand firm in its corner.\nConfucius spoke of those who did not follow the Way,\nand Zhuāngzi (丘明) was called one who did not act without reason.\nThe more one attempts to govern and refine,\nthe more one falls into complexity and disorder.\n\nThus, *The Rites* (礼) value great harmony,\nand *The Book of Changes* (易) prizes adapting to the times.\nSince Heaven speaks not,\nfrom whence does humanity derive its desires?\n\nWithin the realm of creation and among all things,\nthough they follow nature’s course,\neach adheres to its inherent essence.\nEven the common man may grasp what he can,\nyet the sage may still fail to recognize it;\neven the common man may act as he will,\nyet the sage may still not comprehend it.\nHow much more so the profound origins and subtle meanings of the Dao,\nthe refined essence of the Great Way?\nHow dare one speak lightly,\nor rashly claim to have attained its truth?\n\nThe author once passed through **Suìzhōu** (遂州),\nand saw upon the **Lóngxīng Guān** (龙兴观) stone stele\nthe engravings of the two *Dao De Jing* (道德二经).\nUpon close examination,\nthey differed from the current text.\nMany characters were erroneous,\nwith no annotations or chapter titles.\nThough their matters varied in similarity and difference,\ntheir principles were fundamentally opposed.\n\nThe old text says *\"to act without relying upon it,\"*\nyet this one says *\"to act while relying upon it.\"*\nThe old text says *\"do not exalt the worthy,\"*\nyet this one says *\"do not place the worthy above others.\"*\nThe old text says *\"do not dare to act,\"*\nyet this one says *\"do not dare not to act.\"*\nThe old text says *\"those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm,\"*\nyet this one says *\"those who pant will not endure long.\"*\nThe old text says *\"the fields are overgrown with weeds,\"*\nyet this one says *\"the fields are full of sprouts.\"*\nThe old text says *\"much speech,\"*\nyet this one says *\"much hearing.\"*\nThe old text says *\"without self-interest,\"*\nyet this one says *\"without corpse.\"* (尸)\nThe old text says *\"not released,\"*\nyet this one says *\"not drained.\"* (汋)\nThe old text says *\"not conquered,\"*\nyet this one says *\"not filled.\"* (充)\nThe old text says *\"small freshness,\"*\nyet this one says *\"small stench.\"* (腥)\n\nBriefly enumerating these ten discrepancies,\nnot all can be exhaustively listed.\nTheir meanings, when classified,\nnaturally have their distinctions.\n\nLater scholars and former sages,\neach hold their own perspectives.\nSeeing these omissions left behind,\nhow could they not offer supplementation?\n\nWithout measuring the void and emptiness,\nfollowing the text to explain it,\ndivided into two volumes,\nnamed *The Subsequent Explication.*\n\nNot continuing the works of others,\nbut forming a distinct style of my own.\nWho is right, who is wrong—\nthe world will judge accordingly.\n\nI present this to like-minded readers,\nhoping they will not dismiss it lightly.\nRespectfully written.\n\n**Title:** *The Subsequent Explication of the Dao De Jing*\n**Subtitle:** *The Dao De Jing Subsequent Explication*\n**Author:** Anonymous, Tang Dynasty\n**Volumes:** Upper and Lower\n\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongshen* section, *Yujue* category.\nThe original *Jing* lacks chapter divisions; the compiler has supplemented them.\n\n**Volume One of the Dao De Jing Subsequent Explication**\n**Dao Jing**\nThough this text differs from the old,\nits principles are self-contained.\nUpon careful examination of its arguments,\nthere are distinct intentions within.\nFuture scholars must not rashly alter or compare it lightly.\n\n**Chapter One**\n*The Dao that can be spoken of*\nis not the eternal Dao.\n\n**Chapter One (continued)**\nThe character *Dao* is divided into three grades:\nThe highest *Dao* belongs to the **Non-Action, Nameless Great Dao**,\nThe middle *Dao* is the **Formed, Nameable Dao**,\nThe lowest *Dao* refers to the **Ever-Practiced, Applied Dao**.\n\nThat which can be named is not the eternal Name.\nIt too is divided into three grades:\nThe highest Name is the **Name before Naming**,\nThe middle Name is the **Name that can be called**,\nThe lowest Name refers to the **Ever-Practiced, Applied Name**.\n\nWithout a Name, the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nAt first, there was a Name, the Mother of all things.\nBefore Heaven and Earth were divided, it was the beginning of the Nameless.\nWhen clarity and turbidity separated—\nThe clear became Heaven, the turbid became Earth.\nHeaven covered, Earth bore, and all things were within them,\nLike a mother nurturing her children.\nThe Mother is the Great Dao itself.\n\nEver without desire, observe its subtlety;\nEver with desire, observe its peril.\nAll things in the world—\nThe Sage observes their essence and origin,\nThat they arise from the Dao and return to the Dao.\n*Jiǎo* means \"exhausted,\" *miào* means \"born.\"\nThese two, though differing in name, share the same source—\nDesire and non-desire both arise from the Dao.\nThis is called the **Mysterious**.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nThe gateway to all subtleties.\nSince they share the same source, it is called Mysterious.\nWithin it lies all subtlety, making it Mysterious again.\nAll things in the world emerge from this Mysterious gateway.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness already exists.\nAfter all things emerge from the Mysterious gateway,\nThere are five colors to dazzle the eyes,\nFive tones to strike the ears,\nFive flavors to delight the tongue—\nThis is beauty.\nYet the five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors rot the intestines—\nThis is ugliness.\n\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nThen non-goodness already exists.\nMen of the world skillfully devise schemes—\nFrom military strategy to governance,\nFrom the common folk to the ruler,\nAll craftily establish tactics,\nDaily generating countless changes,\nAchieving success and establishing affairs,\nWith applications endless.\nYet schemes first arise in the heart,\nAdaptation exhausts oneself,\nSuccess unmade while life is lost,\nAffairs unestablished while reputation is ruined—\nThis is non-goodness.\n\nBeing and non-being generate each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low depend on each other,\nSounds harmonize,\nDeparture and arrival follow in sequence.\nFrom non-being comes being,\nFrom being comes non-being,\nWhere there is difficulty, there is ease,\nWhere there is long, there is short,\nWhere there is high, there is low,\nWhere there is sound, there is voice,\nWhere there is first, there is last.\nThey generate and complete each other,\nTheir forms and influences interdependently arise,\nTheir harmonies and sequences follow—\nThese six relations in the world\nNever abandon one another.\nThe later text states: *\"The Sage governs by Non-Action,\nThus avoiding these extremes.\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage governs by doing nothing,\nTeaching without words.\nWhen all things act and flourish,\nHe does not claim to be their origin,\nBut precedes them as their servant,\nRelying on the Dao.\nHe does not dwell on success.\nBecause he does not dwell, he does not depart.\nThe Sage governs the world by Non-Action,\nWithout wearying speech,\nAnd all things naturally align.\nAll things flourish without contention for precedence,\nTheir actions leaning on the Dao,\nSuccess and affairs established—\nHe does not reside within them.\nIf he does not reside, his merit does not fade.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three**\nDo not exalt the virtuous,\nSo that people do not contend;\nDo not place oneself above those with virtue and ability,\nSo that people do not vie for position.\nDo not prize rare treasures,\nSo that people do not steal;\nDo not hoard rare wealth,\nSo that there is nothing to steal.\nDo not display what is desirable,\nSo that the heart does not乱 (*luàn*—be disturbed).\nWhen desires do not arise, the mind remains unruffled.\n\nThe Sage governs by:\nEmptying the mind, filling the belly,\nWeakening the will, strengthening the bones.\nEmpty the mind to align with the Dao,\nFill the belly to cultivate virtue,\nWeaken the will to follow nature,\nStrengthen the bones to steady the body.\nEver keep the people in ignorance and without desire,\nSo that the wise dare not act presumptuously.\nEver let the world know Non-Action and non-desire,\nAnd after knowing, they dare not act presumptuously—\nThis is how the Sage governs the world.\nTo govern by Non-Action is to govern all.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is boundless yet used without excess,\nDeep like the origin of all things.\nIt dulls sharpness, resolves anger,\nBlends its brilliance, aligns with dust,\nAnd remains tranquil as if eternally preserved.\n\nThe Dao’s nature is boundless and empty,\nYet when used, it does not overflow—\nIts roots profound, the source of all things.\nThe Sage follows it, and none under Heaven can surpass him.\nThus he dulls sharpness as if foolish,\nResolves anger and remains pure,\nBlends his brilliance and shares the common place,\nAligns with dust and remains unassuming—\nSo he endures tranquilly in the world.\n\nI do not know whose child he is,\nYet he precedes the Emperor.\nThe Sage stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Great Dao,\nThus he is not a man’s son.\nThe Great Dao existed before Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the Sage existed before Heaven and Earth—\nHence, he is called *\"the one who precedes the Emperor.\"*\n*\"The Emperor\"* refers to Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nThey treat all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not benevolent;\nHe treats the people as straw dogs.\nThe Sage follows Heaven and Earth,\nUniting the generation of virtue and power,\nNot governing with benevolence,\nFor the people and all things each have their natural natures.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIt is like a *tuóqiào*—\n*A tuó* is a bag, *qiào* a tube.\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing.\nMuch hearing leads to exhaustion of knowledge,\nBetter to uphold sincerity.\n\nThe *tuóqiào* is empty like Heaven and Earth,\nReceiving *qi* yet ever producing—\nThis refers to practicing the Dao.\nMuch hearing confuses true perception,\nBetter to uphold sincerity.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe *Gu Valley* does not die—\nThis is called the **Mysterious Feminine**.\nThe Mysterious Feminine gate—\nThe root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndless, as if ever-present,\nUsed without exhaustion.\n\n*Gu* means \"nourish.\"\n*Xuán* (Mysterious) belongs to the nose, governing life—Heaven.\n*Pìn* (Feminine) belongs to the mouth, governing death—Earth.\nThe nose inhales pure *qi*, the mouth exhales turbid *qi*,\nMaking their flow continuous,\nCultivating the spirit in tranquility—\nNeither taking in externally nor emitting internally—\nThus, there is no labor for life.\n\n「Only the sages and worthies can cultivate it; few in the world are able to practice it.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nHeaven and Earth endure long—\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure long is that they do not generate themselves,\nThus they can endure long.\nHeaven and Earth embody the Dao and thereby give birth,\nThey allow all things to generate naturally,\nThus they can endure long.\nTherefore, the sage places himself behind while his deeds advance,\nSets himself aside while his body is preserved.\nBecause he has no rigid self,\nHe is thus like the soil and can complete his body.\n\nThe sage places his person behind others yet leads them,\nSets himself aside yet upholds the Dao,\nDoes not lord over all things,\nThus all things rely on him as their lord.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nThe highest excellence is like water—\nWater excels in benefiting all things yet does not struggle,\nIt dwells in the evils of all things,\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\nWater’s nature embodies the Dao,\nIts form and substance are gentle and weak—\nIt flows to high places yet rests in low ones,\nFollows the square yet adapts to the round,\nAll evils converge upon it,\nYet it contains and embraces all things,\nDoes not contend with anything,\nBenefits all things,\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\nThe land is good at being low,\nFollowing the land’s form—\nHigh in effort yet low in result.\n\nThe heart is good at being deep,\nWater’s heart is empty and void,\nLike the Dao’s non-substantiality.\n\nIt is good at benevolence,\nWater’s nature has benevolent action,\nExcels in benefiting and aiding all things.\n\nIts speech is good at trustworthiness,\nResponding to things like an echo.\n\nIts governance is good at regulation,\nWashing and cleansing all impurities.\n\nIts affairs are good at capability,\nGreen, yellow, red, and white—\nAll arise from what is needed.\n\nIts actions are good at timing—\nMoving in accordance with the time,\nNever losing their appropriateness.\n\nOnly because it does not struggle,\nThus it has no blame.\nSo, when it does not contend with things,\nThus it has no faults or grievances.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nTo grasp and fill—\nThis is not as good as letting it be.\nTo measure and sharpen—\nThis cannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them.\nRiches and honor lead to arrogance,\nSelf-inflicting their calamities.\n\nWhen name is accomplished,\nWhen deed is fulfilled,\nRetire the body—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nTo hold and act—\nEven if one obtains fullness,\nIt is not as good as stopping.\nTo measure and discern worldly affairs,\nTo gain their sharpness—\nThis is not yet a treasure for the body.\nTo pile gold and amass jade,\nTo fill one’s hall with treasures,\nOne cannot long preserve them.\nTo rely on riches and honor,\nOnly to indulge in arrogance and insolence,\nOne must invite misfortune and blame.\n\nTherefore, the sage accomplishes his deeds and establishes his affairs,\nFollows the Dao of Heaven and Earth and withdraws from them.\n\nThe Dao fills and empties,\nRetreats and reveals—\nIts patterns are undefined.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nTo carry the spirit and embrace unity—\nThe Dao can thus remain inseparable.\nThe spirit is called *hún* (魂),\nThe form is called *pò* (魄).\nThe body is like a carriage,\nCarrying its spirit and form.\n\nTo embrace and guard its unity,\nDay and night to tend and nurture,\nSo that the spirit and form do not depart from the body.\n\nTo focus the *qi* and achieve gentleness,\nOne can be like an infant.\nTo focus and guard the primal *qi*,\nMaking it gentle and weak as an infant,\nWithout distinctions.\n\nTo purify and remove the Mysterious,\nTo preserve the subtle and achieve flawlessness.\nTo wash and cleanse the subtle mysteries,\nMaking them without blemish or disease.\nBlemish is akin to disease.\n\nTo love people and govern the state,\nYet without knowledge—\nOne should entrust to the Great Dao,\nNot awaiting the discernment of knowledge.\n\nTo be clear and fourfold,\nYet without action—\nTo be in accord with non-action.\n\nThe Heavenly Gate opens and shuts,\nYet remains feminine.\nThe Heavenly Gate is the gate of longevity and nourishment.\nAlways guarding the feminine,\nNever becoming the masculine.\n\nTo generate and store—\nTo generate yet not possess,\nTo act yet not rely,\nTo grow yet not slaughter—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe sage generates and lengthens his body,\nStores and nourishes his body,\nDoes not possess his body,\nDoes not rely on his body,\nDoes not slaughter or harm his body—\nThis can be called the Mysterious and Wondrous Virtue.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nYet it is the empty space that makes the carriage’s use.\nTo knead clay and shape vessels,\nYet it is the empty space that makes the vessel’s use.\nTo pierce doors and windows to make a room,\nYet it is the empty space that makes the room’s use.\n\nTo have it for utility,\nTo have no form for wondrous use.\nThis explains how the Dao generates being from non-being.\n\nSuppose one constructs a carriage,\nWith wheels, spokes, and hub—\nWhen it is not yet formed as a carriage,\nThe mind still holds its use.\nLike kneading clay,\nThis is the method for shaping vessels—\nWhen the vessel is not yet formed,\nThe mind still holds its use.\nAgain, like rooms and houses,\nWhen doors, windows, and openings are not yet formed,\nThe mind still holds their use.\n\nAfter form arises,\nIt becomes a means of utility.\nBefore form arises,\nIt can be a wondrous use.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nFive colors blind the eyes—\nBlue, yellow, red, white, and black—\nIf one gazes at external colors,\nHe loses his true vision,\nThis is blindness.\n\nFive tones deafen the ears—\n*Gōng* (宮), *shāng* (商), *jué* (角), *zhǐ* (征), and *yǔ* (羽)—\nIf one listens to other sounds,\nHe loses his true hearing,\nThis is deafness.\n\nFive flavors dull the palate—\nSour, bitter, sweet, salty, and spicy—\nIf one indulges in their tastes,\nHe loses his tranquility and simplicity.\n\nHunting and gallivanting in the fields drive the heart to madness—\nPursuing and taking the lives of things,\nWandering and dissipating the spirit,\nDriving one to frenzy,\nGenerating greedy and lustful desires.\n\nRare and coveted goods obstruct proper conduct—\nGold, silver, and precious treasures—\nThose who love them obstruct their own upright path.\n\nTherefore, the sage cultivates for the belly, not for the eyes,\nThus he discards the latter to take the former.\nTo cultivate for the belly is to refine the inner,\nTo cultivate for the eyes is to refine the outer,\nThus he discards the outer refinement to take the inner cultivation.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nFavor and disgrace, honor and humiliation—\nThese are like sudden alarms.\nHe holds great calamities as dear as his own body.\n\nWhat is meant by favor and disgrace?\nFavor is low—\nWhen one loses favor, it increases.\nTo gain it is like an alarm,\nTo lose it is like an alarm—\nFavor and disgrace depend on each other,\nGain and loss both bring alarm.\n\nThis is called favor and disgrace being like sudden alarms.\n\nWhat is meant by holding great calamities as dear as one’s body?\nThe Five Phases contend and destroy each other,\nThe Four Great Elements invade and harm each other,\nThus they are great calamities.\nThe reason I have great calamities is that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body,\nWhat calamities do I have?\nNot possessing one’s body,\nNot relying on fame and status,\nThus one has no great calamities.\n\nTherefore, one who values his body above the world\nCan be entrusted with the world.\nOne who loves his body above the world\nCan be entrusted with the world.\n\nFavor arises from disgrace,\nCalamities come from the body itself.\nThe sage does not rejoice in favor,\nDoes not fear disgrace,\nThus he has no great calamities.\n\nOne who values his body without disgrace\nCan be entrusted with the world and its affairs.»\n\n「One who cherishes his body without calamity,\nCan entrust the world to him.\n\nThis is how a sovereign entrusts the world\nAnd shares governance with the sages and worthies.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen:**\nWhen seen, it is not seen—this is called *leveling* (平, *jì*).\nWhen heard, it is not heard—this is called *reaching the subtle* (达, *xī*).\nWhen sought through extensive knowledge, it cannot be obtained—this is called *the exquisite and mysterious* (妙, *wēi*).\nThese three cannot be achieved through questioning or scrutiny,\nThus they merge into one *Dao/Way*.\n\nIts highest aspect is not dazzlingly clear,\nIts lowest aspect is not obscure.\nIt is ceaseless like the buzzing of flies,\nYet cannot be named—returning to *nothingness* (無物, *wúwù*).\nThis is the formless form,\nThe shapeless image—\nCalled *the elusive and indistinct* (忽怳物色, *hūhuǎng wùsè*).\n\nApproaching it, one does not see its beginning,\nFollowing it, one does not see its end.\nHolding fast to the *Dao/Way* of antiquity and practicing it constantly,\nTo counter the *doings* (有, *yǒu*) of the present age.\nTo know the ancient origins and reflect upon them—this is called *the framework of the Dao/Way*.\nThe great *Dao/Way* cannot be perceived by sight or hearing,\nThrough exhaustive knowledge or relentless inquiry,\nThus it is unified and sought as one.\nIn high station, it is not dazzlingly clear,\nIn low station, it is not doubted or obscured.\nIts principle is unbroken,\nReturning to the *Dao/Way*—called *nothingness*.\nThis is the form of form,\nThe image of images—\nSometimes present, sometimes absent—\nThus it is named *elusive and indistinct*.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* has no beginning or end,\nThus one cannot see it when approaching or following.\nBut holding fast to the *Dao/Way* of antiquity and practicing it constantly,\nOne may counter the *doings* of the present age.\nTo know the beginning and end of the *Dao/Way* from antiquity—\nThis is called *the framework and principles of the Dao/Way*.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen:**\nThose of old who were skilled in being a *scholar-official* (士, *shì*)\nWere those who cultivated the *Dao/Way*.\nSubtle, mysterious, and profound,\nDeep beyond comprehension.\n\nSince it is beyond comprehension,\nYet they feigned its appearance:\nCautious as one crossing a river in winter,\nWith dread and fear.\nLike one fearing neighbors on all sides,\nYet appearing composed,\nAlways conducting oneself with respect and propriety.\nDissolving like ice about to melt and disperse,\nPurity like the uncarved block (*朴*, *pǔ*),\nVast like a valley—\nA valley can be broad and expansive.\nTurbulent like muddy floodwaters.\nMuddy waters clarify when still.\nFloodwaters reveal order when settled.\nStability generates life when moved gradually.\nWhen the body is at ease, all things flourish.\nThose who safeguard this *Dao/Way*\nDo not seek fullness.\nIf one sees this *Dao/Way*, then one will not be full.\nOnly by not desiring fullness\nCan one be depleted yet again restored.\n\nThose of old who were skilled in cultivating the *Dao/Way*\nHad profound and mysterious matters,\nConcealing their traces and hiding their names.\nThe common people did not recognize them,\nSo they feigned demeanor to blend with the times.\nLike one crossing a river in winter, full of fear,\nLike one dwelling with dread of neighbors,\nLike a guest with proper etiquette,\nLike ice forming yet ready to disperse,\nLike the uncarved block in purity,\nLike a valley in its emptiness,\nAlways like muddy floodwaters.\nIn muddy floodwaters, clarity emerges when still.\nIn stability, life arises when moved gradually.\nAnd not seeking fullness,\nAlways abiding in depletion and obscurity,\nThey could guard their place within the *Dao/Way*.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen:**\nTo attain *emptiness* (虚, *xū*) to its utmost extreme,」\n\n「To reach the realm of the *Great Dao/Way* (至大道域, *zhì dà dào yù*),」\nIt is to hold steadfast to *stillness* (守静, *shǒu jìng*), being profound and thick.\n\nAll things arise and flourish together (万物并作兴也, *wàn wù bìng zuò xīng yě*), yet I observe their return (吾以观其复, *wú yǐ guān qí fù*).\nThe return of all things is called *reversion* (万物所归曰复, *wàn wù suǒ guī yuē fù*).\nThings drift and gather (物云云, *wù yún yún*), each having its own source of generation (各有所生, *gè yǒu suǒ shēng*).\nReturning to their roots is called *stillness* (归根曰静, *guī gēn yuē jìng*).\nWhen cultivating the *Dao/Way* reaches the utmost extreme of *emptiness* (修道至虚极之处, *xiū dào zhì xū jí zhī chù*), one then sees all things either born or extinguished (乃见万物或生或灭, *nǎi jiàn wàn wù huò shēng huò miè*), and also sees all things drifting and gathering (又见万物云云, *yòu jiàn wàn wù yún yún*), each having its fundamental origin to which they return (尽有根本所归, *jìn yǒu gēn běn suǒ guī*), still returning to *stillness* (还归於静, *huán guī yú jìng).\n*Stillness* is called *reversion of vital essence* (静曰复命, *jìng yuē fù mìng*), and *reversion of vital essence* is called *permanence* (复命曰常, *fù mìng yuē cháng*), which does not change or alter (不变易也, *bù biàn yì yě*).\nKnowing *permanence* is called *clarity* (知常曰明, *zhī cháng yuē míng*).\nNot knowing *permanence* and acting recklessly is perilous (不知常，妄作，凶, *bù zhī cháng, wàng zuò, xiōng*).\nRecognizing the *Dao/Way*, one then knows that *allotment of vital essence* is *clarity* (认得其道，乃知分命谓明, *rèn dé qí dào, nǎi zhī fèn mìng wèi míng*).\nSeeing the *Dao/Way* as singular (见其道一也, *jiàn qí dào yī yě*), if one does not know *permanence* within the allotment (若不知常於分上, *ruò bù zhī cháng yú fèn shàng*), and recklessly acts beyond it (妄有作为, *wàng yǒu zuò wéi*), this is perilous (是凶, *shì xiōng*).\nThis is called *transgressing the allotment and acting* (言越分而行也, *yán yuè fèn ér xíng yě*).\n\nKnowing *permanence* allows for *universality* (知常容, *zhī cháng róng*), *universality* can be *public* (容能公, *róng néng gōng*), *public* can *generate* (公能生, *gōng néng shēng*), and *generation* without private intent is *natural* (无私自生, *wú sī zì shēng*).\n*Natural* can be *Heavenly* (生能天, *shēng néng tiān*), for it possesses the virtue of nurturing (有长养恩, *yǒu zhǎng yǎng ēn*).\n*Heavenly* can be the *Dao/Way* (天能道, *tiān néng dào*), for it embodies and acts in accordance with the *Dao/Way* (体道而行, *tǐ dào ér xíng*).\nThe *Dao/Way* can endure (道能久, *dào néng jiǔ*), for it is neither born nor extinguished (无生无灭, *wú shēng wú miè*).\nThus, one’s body remains unharmed (没身不殆, *mò shēn bù dài*).\nHaving known its *permanence*, one can embrace all the joys and dislikes of the world as *public* (能容世上一切好恶曰公, *néng róng shì shàng yīqiè hào wù yuē gōng*).\nReaching *public* without private bias, one can generate all things (至公无私，能生万物, *zhì gōng wú sī, néng shēng wàn wù*), like *Heaven* and the *Dao/Way* sharing the same virtue (如天与道同德, *rú tiān yǔ dào tóng dé*).\nThose who know this remain unharmed throughout their lives (知此者终身不见危殆也, *zhī cǐ zhě zhōng shēn bù jiàn wēi dài yě*).\n\n**Chapter Seventeen:**\nThe *Supreme Sovereign* (太上, *Tài Shàng*),」\n\nThe *Supreme Sovereign* (太上, *Tài Shàng*) resides in the highest position—this is called the *Supreme Sovereign*.\n\nThe next level, *Knowing* (下知, *Xià Zhī*), understands the nature and emotions of all things. It has its own *Dao/Way* (故有其道, *gù yǒu qí dào*), for it follows the *Dao/Way* of discernment.\n\nThe next is *Closeness* (其次, *Qín Zhī*), which can harmonize with all things (能顺万物, *néng shùn wàn wù*), and *Praise* (誉之, *Yù Zhī*), which nurtures what it brings forth (善其所生, *shàn qí suǒ shēng*).\n\nThe next is *Fear* (畏之, *Wèi Zhī*), fearing the rise and fall of life and death (有生灭, *yǒu shēng miè*). *Contempt* (侮之, *Wǔ Zhī*) scorns all things, failing to grasp their *Dao/Way* (不得其道, *bù dé qí dào*).\n\nWhen *trust* is insufficient (信不足, *xìn bù zú*), there arises *untrustworthiness* (有不信, *yǒu bù xìn*), as if one were *valuing words over substance* (其犹贵言, *qí yóu guì yán*). When *achievements* are completed (成功遂事, *chéng gōng suí shì*), the people say, *\"The *Supreme Sovereign* acts naturally.\"* The *sage* observes the chaos of all things, always upholding *trust* and *substance* (常存信贵言), establishing *achievements* and *affairs* (成功立事), so that the people do not know their origin and say, *\"This is the natural *Dao/Way*.\"*\n\n**Chapter Eighteen:**\nWhen the *Great Dao/Way* is abandoned (大道废, *Dà Dào Fèi*), there arise *benevolence* and *righteousness* (有仁义, *yǒu rén yì*).\nWhen *wisdom* emerges (智慧出, *zhì huì chū*), there arises *great deceit* (有大伪, *yǒu dà wěi*).\nWhen the *six relationships* are discordant (六亲不和, *liù qīn bù hé*), there arise *filial piety* and *kindness* (有孝慈, *yǒu xiào cí*).\nWhen the state is in confusion and darkness (国家昏乱, *guó jiā hūn luàn*), there arise *loyal subjects* (有忠臣, *yǒu zhōng chén*).\n\nWhen the *Great Dao/Way* is in practice (大道之行也, *Dà Dào zhī xíng yě*), there is no *levelness* or *unevenness* (无平陂, *wú píng bī*), no *deceit* or *falsehood* (无诈伪, *wú zhà wěi*), no *nearness* or *distance* (无亲疏, *wú qīn cuō*), no *loyalty* or *filial piety* (无忠孝, *wú zhōng xiào*).\n\nWhen the *Great Dao/Way* is abandoned (大道之废也, *Dà Dào zhī fèi yě*), there arise *benevolence* and *righteousness*, with the *seven virtues* (七义, *qī yì*) arising from *unevenness* (出於不平, *chū yú bù píng*).\nThere arises *wisdom*, yet *wisdom* stems from the need to establish words (智慧因於为立言, *zhì huì yīn yú wéi lì yán*).\nThere arises *filial piety* and *kindness*, yet these stem from the absence of *respect* and *reverence* (孝慈为无敬恭, *xiào cí wéi wú jìng gōng*).\nThere arise *loyal subjects*, yet this is because the *sovereign* has lost the *Dao/Way* of governance (言主失其治道也, *yán zhǔ shī qí zhì dào yě*).\n\n**Chapter Nineteen:**\nAbandon *learning* and *wisdom*, and the people will be a hundred times more *benefited* (利, *lì*).\nThe *sage* establishes laws and transforms the people (圣人立法化人, *shèng rén lì fǎ huà rén*), while the *wise* devise plans to promote *benefits* (智者设计兴利, *zhì zhě shè zhì xīng lì*).\nWhen there are laws, there will be crimes (有法则有罪, *yǒu fǎ zé yǒu zuì*).\nWhen there are *benefits*, there will be *harm* (有利则有害, *yǒu lì zé yǒu hài*).\n\nAbandon *benevolence* and *righteousness*, and the people will return to *filial piety* and *kindness* (人复孝慈, *rén fù xiào cí*).\n*Benevolence* can *assist* things (仁能济物, *rén néng jì wù*), and *righteousness* can *establish* affairs (义可立事, *yì kě lì shì*), yet *assistance* may not always *assist* (济有不济, *jì yǒu bù jì*), and *affairs* may not always be *established* (事有不事, *shì yǒu bù shì*).\n\nAbandon *artifice* and *gain*, and thieves and robbers will cease to exist (盗贼无有, *dào zéi wú yǒu*).\n*Artifice* creates *schemes* and *tricks* (巧作机权, *qiǎo zuò jī quán*), while *gain* seduces the world (利美天下, *lì měi tiān xià*).\nThieves follow from *deceit* (贼从奸生, *zéi cóng jiān shēng*), and robbers are tempted by *gain* (盗因利诱, *dào yīn lì yòu*).\n\nThese three—*benevolence*, *righteousness*, and *wisdom*—are insufficient to govern as *substance* (文, *wén*), so one must make them have their *proper places* (所属, *suǒ shǔ*).\nThus, one does not rely solely on these three as *governing principles* (文法, *wén fǎ*), but instead establishes separate *teachings* and *commands* (别立教令, *bié lì jiào lìng*), assigning each its proper place (使其各有所属, *shǐ qí gè yǒu suǒ shǔ*).\n\nWhen one *sees simplicity* (见素, *jiàn sù*) and *embraces plainness* (抱扑, *bào pū*), with *few private desires* (少私, *shǎo sī*) and *scant wants* (寡欲, *guǎ yù*), then the people will align with these four virtues.\n*Seeing simplicity* means discarding ornamentation (去华也, *qù huá yě*).\n*Embracing plainness* means maintaining pure essence (纯质也, *chún zhì yě*).\n*Few private desires* means discarding self (去己也, *qù jǐ yě*).\n*Scant wants* means having no worries (无忧也, *wú yōu yě*).\n\n**Chapter Twenty:**\nAbandon *learning* and there will be no *worries* (绝学无忧, *jué xué wú yōu*).\n*Learning* has its *limitations* (有所不足, *yǒu suǒ bù zú), so abandoning it and holding to the *Dao/Way* leads to no *worries* (守道则无忧, *shǒu dào zé wú yōu*).\n\nThe *Yes* (唯, *wéi*) and the *Ah* (阿, *ē*)—how far apart are they?\nThe *beautiful* (美, *měi*) and the *evil* (恶, *è*)—how different are they?\nThe *Yes* and *Ah* do not separate (唯诺不相离, *wéi nuò bù xiāng lí*), the *beautiful* and *evil* do not part (美恶不相舍, *měi è bù xiāng shè*).\n\nWhat people *fear* (人之所畏, *rén zhī suǒ wèi*), one cannot avoid *fearing* (不可不畏, *bù kě bù wèi*).\nThe paths of *life* and *death* (生死二途, *shēng sǐ èr tú*), before they are seen, cannot but be feared (未见之时, *wèi jiàn zhī shí*).\nYet when one *sees* their *boundlessness* (未央, *wèi yāng*), the *Great Dao/Way* has no *center* or *four directions* (无有中央四方, *wú yǒu zhōng yāng sì fāng*).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 21**\nThe bearing of great *virtue/power* (德, *dé*), follows only the *Dao/Way* (道, *dào*).\n\nThe *Dao/Way* as a thing—\nOnly vague and indistinct (唯怳唯惚, *wéi yǎo wéi hú*).\nWithin its vague and indistinct,\nThere is a substance (有物),\nWithin its vague and indistinct,\nThere are forms (有像).\nThe *Dao/Way* has no form or substance (无形质, *wú xíng zhì*),\nYet within its presence and absence (於有无之间, *yú yǒu wú zhī jiān*),\nIt can give birth to things and their images.\n\nWithin the profound and dark (窈冥, *yǎo míng*), there is the essence (精, *jīng*),\nAnd within that essence, there is trust (信, *xìn*).\nThe profound and dark is the *Dao/Way*.\nWith its true essence sought,\nThe response is certain,\nAnd trust is never lost.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has not faded (其名不去, *qí míng bù qù*),\nFor through observation (以阅览, *yǐ yuè lǎn*) it is always seen as good (终未也, *zhōng wèi yě*).\nHow do I know that the end is ever good?\nBecause of this:\nFrom ancient times to now,\nThis method has never been strained,\nAnd through it, all good things are observed.\n\nThe *Dao/Way*-knowing sage (圣人, *shèng rén*) understands\nThat all good things arise naturally from this.\n\n**Chapter 22**\nWhen bent, it is whole (曲则全, *qū zé quán*).\nWhen forced and bent, it stands upright (枉屈也则正, *wǎng qū yě zé zhèng*).\nWhen hollowed, it overflows (洼则盈, *wā zé yíng*).\nWhen worn out, it renews (弊则新, *bì zé xīn*).\nWhen few in number, they are gained (少则得, *shǎo zé dé*).\nWhen many, it brings confusion (多则惑, *duō zé huò*).\n\nThus, the sage embraces *Oneness* (一, *yī*) as the model for all under heaven.\n\nWhen one bends oneself, all is accomplished (曲己则事全, *qū jǐ zé shì quán*).\nWhen one forces and bends oneself, one’s conduct becomes upright (枉身则表正, *wǎng shēn zé biǎo zhèng*).\nWhen one hollows and lowers oneself, one overflows (洼浅则盈, *wā xiān zé yíng*).\nThus, when worn out, one renews oneself (故弊则自新, *gù bì zé zì xīn*).\nWhen one seeks little, one gains much (少求则得多, *shǎo qiú zé dé duō*).\nWhen one seeks much, one is confused and troubled (多求则惑乱, *duō qiú zé huò luàn*).\nThis is why the sage embraces *Oneness* as the model of the *Dao/Way*.\n\nNot asserting oneself, one becomes prominent (不自是，故彰, *bù zì shì, gù zhāng*).\nNot displaying oneself, one becomes clear (不自见，故明, *bù zì jiàn, gù míng*).\nNot praising oneself, one achieves merit (不自伐，故有功, *bù zì fá, gù yǒu gōng*).\nNot boasting, one endures (不自矜，故长, *bù zì jīn, gù zhǎng*).\n\nNot asserting oneself, one cannot be contended with.\nThe ancients spoke of \"when bent, it is whole\"—\nWas this not true speech?\nThus, it is accomplished and returned to the sage.\n\nWhen one bends oneself to follow things (曲己从物, *qū jǐ cóng wù*),\nThings cannot contend with one.\nThe ancients practiced this *Dao/Way*—\nWas this not true speech?\nWhen matters are accomplished,\nThe whole returns to the sage.\n\n**Chapter 23**\n*Rarely* (希, *xī*) speaks, yet it is natural (言自然, *yán zìrán*).\n\n「也。\n　　飘风不终朝，骤雨不终日。\n　　孰为此？天地。\n　　天地尚不能久，而况於人？\n　　道本无言，常贵自然。\n　　飘风，猛风也；骤雨，暴雨也。\n　　天地尚不能以风雨终日终朝，世人争以言教立事。\n　　故从事而道者，道得之；\n　　同於德者，德得之；\n　　同於失者，道失之。\n　　信不足，有不信。\n　　随从其道者得其道，随从其德者得其德，随从其失者失其道。\n　　但存其信，物无不信，谓不重言也。\n\n**Chapter 24**\nThe gusting wind does not last a morning,\nThe sudden rain does not last a day.\nWho brings this about? The heavens and earth.\nHeaven and earth cannot endure long,\nHow much less can man?\nThe Dao/Way is originally speechless,\nAnd always values naturalness.\nGusting wind—violent wind—does not last a morning.\nSudden rain—torrent rain—does not last a day.\nEven heaven and earth cannot sustain wind and rain indefinitely,\nYet men strive to impose their words and teachings upon affairs.\nThus, those who act in accordance with the Dao/Way\nGain the Dao/Way;\nThose aligned with virtue/power\nGain virtue/power;\nThose aligned with failure\nLose the Dao/Way.\nInsufficient trust leads to distrust,\nYet if one preserves trust,\nAll things will trust in turn—\nThis means not repeating one’s words.\n\n**Chapter 25**\nThere exists a thing that blends into unity,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,\nCirculating endlessly without exhaustion,\nIt may be called the Mother of the world.\nThe Dao/Way is originally empty and still,\nWithout companions or partisans,\nIt does not alter its course with obscurity or clarity,\nCirculating through the world without danger or exhaustion,\nNurturing all things like a mother rears her child.\nI do not know its name—\nI call it the Dao/Way,\nAnd forcefully name it the Great.\nGreat means \"passing away\"—\nPassing away means distant things cannot follow,\nDistant means \"returning\"—\nThus, the Dao/Way is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nThe King is Great.\nThe four Great ones within the realm,\nAnd the King holds one of them.\nThe Dao/Way was born before heaven and earth,\nYet acts after them.\nSeeking it, one does not see its form,\nUsing it, one finds response—\nThus, I forcefully establish its name as the Great.\nThe Great, when sought, is not obtained—it passes away;\nPassing away, when sought, is not obtained—it is distant;\nDistant, when sought, is not obtained—it returns.\nReturn means withdrawing back to the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way stands with heaven and earth,\nYet kings all honor its Greatness,\nAnd return to guard its Dao/Way.\nMan follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao/Way,\nThe Dao/Way follows naturalness.\nEarth bears all things,\nThus man follows it.\nHeaven nourishes all things,\nThus Earth follows it.\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to heaven and earth,\nThus it is called naturalness.\n\n**Chapter 26**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness,\nStillness is the master of agitation.\nLightness and frivolity are branches and leaves,\nHeaviness and solidity are the foundation.\nAgitation and restlessness are the people,\nStillness and composure are the ruler.\nThus, the sage acts throughout the day without abandoning his baggage.\nThis means he embraces the Dao/Way and holds virtue/power,\nLike one carrying heavy baggage.\nThough he has palaces and pavilions of splendor,\nHe dwells in his chambers with serene detachment.\nHow much more so for the king of a great realm,\nWho bears the weight of the world lightly?\nLightness leads to losing one’s foundation in the Dao/Way,\nAgitation leads to losing one’s composure.\nIf the ruler does not hold heaviness,\nHe will lose his Dao/Way;\nIf he is agitated and restless,\nHe will lose his position.\n\n**Chapter 27**\nThe good path leaves no trace near,\nThe good word has no distant reach—\nWithout tracks or paths,\nIt arrives everywhere;\nWithout words or teachings,\nIt acts everywhere.\nGood plans do not require calculations—\nThere are affairs in the world that cannot be strategized,\nCalculations cannot reach them,\nOnly the Dao/Way knows them.\nGood closure has no gates or bars that can be opened,\nGood binding has no cords or knots that can be untied.\nThere are gates, bars, cords, and knots,\nWhich can be opened or untied—\nBut those bound and closed by the Dao/Way\nCannot be opened or untied.\nThus, the sage always rescues men without abandoning them,\nAlways rescues things without abandoning them—\nThis is the clear principle of succession.\nHe rescues the unvirtuous with virtue,\nGathering them to return to virtue.\nThe sage not only rescues men,\nHe also rescues things—\nThis is the principle of succession made manifest.\nThus, the virtuous man is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nThe unvirtuous man is the resource of the virtuous.\nThe virtuous man teaches the unvirtuous,\nThus he is called their teacher.\nThe unvirtuous man, when taught, follows the Dao/Way,\nThus he benefits the virtuous as a resource.\nIf one does not honor his teacher,\nIf one does not cherish his resource,\nThough his wisdom be vast, he is greatly confused—\nThere are men in the world who are not teachers,\nFor they do not cherish the benefit of resources.\nThough they possess wisdom,\nThey are greatly misguided.\nThis is called the essential mystery—\nFor teaching men and rescuing things\nIs the essential mystery.\n\n**Chapter 28**\nKnowing the strong, one guards the weak,\nAnd becomes the path for the world.\nConstant virtue/power does not depart,\nAnd returns to the state of the infant.\nThe strong is forceful, the weak is yielding—\nGuarding the weak like a path for all streams,\nThen virtue/power does not depart from oneself,\nAnd one remains as feeble as an infant.\nKnowing the bright, one guards the dark,\nAnd becomes the model for the world.\nConstant virtue/power does not falter—\nAnd returns to the principle of the boundless.\nKnowing the pure white,\nOne guards the obscure and dim—\nThis is the model.\nAgain, one does not lend purity and brightness to others,\nTo make them conform to one’s desires,\nBut one’s own desires return to the boundless principle.\nKnowing the honored, one guards the humiliated,\nAnd becomes the valley for the world.\nConstant virtue/power is complete,\nAnd returns to simplicity.\nHonor arises from humiliation,\nHonor lost returns to humiliation—\nBetter to guard humiliation.\nHumiliation is like a valley,\nReceiving the world’s evils,\nThus virtue/power is complete and harmonized with simplicity.\nSimplicity disperses to form vessels—\nThe sage uses it for officials and leaders—\nThus, great governance does not slaughter.\nAfter forming vessels, it returns to simplicity—\nThose with great governance do not slaughter the world,\nFor officials and leaders arise from simplicity and can thus govern.\n\n「其有窃神器，逆天物，强欲为治者，是返道，败德也。\n　　夫物或行或随，或嘘或吹，或强或羸，或接或隳。\n　　圣人去甚，去奢，去泰。\n　　夫物行善则恶随，行恶则善随，\n　　冷者要嘘，热者愿吹，\n　强者恃壮，弱者授羸，\n　未有可接，早有所隳。\n　　故去甚，恶极也；\n　　去奢，恶华也；\n　　去泰，恶骄也。\n\n三十章\n以道佐人主者，不以兵强天下，\n　　其事好还。\n　　兵用讨不庭，以道治天下者，\n　　四海自宾，不假用於强兵，\n　　其事自归於人主之德。\n　　还犹归也。\n　　师之所处，荆棘生；\n　　兴兵之后，在处伤残，\n　　田园荒废，故生荆棘。\n　　善者果敢也而已，不以取强。\n　　善为治者，果敢於道，\n　　故不敢强。\n　　果而勿骄，果而勿矜，\n　　果而勿伐，不自恣也，\n　　不衒己也，不恃功也。\n　　果而不得已，是果而勿强。\n　　物壮则老，谓之非道，早已。\n　　果敢於不得已，则是其道也。\n　　不於强壮果敢，谓不涉於道。\n　　言非道者，事不可也。\n\n三十一章\n夫佳善也好也兵者，\n　　不祥吉也之器，\n　　物或恶之，故有道者不处。\n　　善好用兵者，谓之不吉。\n　　万物皆恶，是有道不同兵也。\n　　君子居则贵左，用兵则贵右。\n　　左主治，右主权。\n　　兵者不祥之器，\n　　非君子之器，\n　　不得已而用之。\n　　君子以道为器，\n　　失道用兵。\n　　恬淡为上，故不美。\n　　恬淡为无征伐也。\n　　有战争则於国不为美事。\n　　若美必乐之，\n　　是乐杀人。\n　　夫乐之者，则不可得意於天下。\n　　若美用兵，\n　　是乐战争，\n　　乐战争是乐杀人，\n　　乐杀人必失天下之人意也。\n　　吉事军礼尚左，\n　　丧礼尚右戎丧。\n　　偏将军居左，\n　上将军居右，\n　　言以丧礼处之。\n　　杀人众多，\n　　以悲哀泣之，\n　战胜以丧礼处之。\n　　国君居中，\n　故有左右。\n　左属阳，主治；\n　右属阴，主杀。\n　偏将佐邦统，\n　右将主权变。\n　古者以礼乐征伐，\n　虽兴兵，常怀恻隐之心，\n　及其胜也，哀慜焉，\n　谓之丧礼也。\n\n三十二章\n道常无名，朴虽小，\n　　天下不敢臣。\n　　王侯若能守，\n　　万物将自宾。\n　　国君富有天下，\n　　若能守无名之大道，\n　　万物尽宾。\n　　天地相合，\n　　以降甘露，\n　　人莫之令而自均。\n　　天行甘泽，\n　　在处皆遍，非人力所均，\n　　言道能普也。\n　　始制有名，\n　　新成有象，\n　　名亦既有，\n　　成器也。\n　　夫亦将知止，\n　　万物休也。\n　　知止不殆，\n　　不见危殆。\n　　譬道在天下，\n　　犹川谷与江海。\n　　万物始因道而生，\n　生而复灭，\n　不有其生，则不危殆。\n　如川谷下流，\n　往而不返，有所归也。\n\n三十三章\n知人者智，\n　　自知者明。\n　　以智知人，不若自知。\n　　用智损心，自知明道。\n　　胜人者有力，\n　　自胜者强。\n　　以力胜人，不若自胜，\n　　自胜者强於胜人。\n　　知足者富，\n　　世财无限，己身有限，\n　　苟或知足，便是富有。\n　　强行有志。\n　　不失其所者久，\n　死而不亡者寿。\n　　强行上件之事，\n　有志於道，\n　不失其由，可以长久。\n　人死之后，\n　魂气归於天，形魄归於地，\n　道德不亡，可谓寿矣。\n\n三十四章\n大道泛，其可左右。」\n\n「The

will naturally return to the proper Dao.\n\n*End of the Second Scroll of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n\n**The Classic of Virtue**\n\nThose who expound the Dao say:\nThe origin of all things is formless—this is the Dao.\nThe function of all things is manifest—this is Virtue.\n\nVirtue arises from the Dao,\nThe Dao is fulfilled through Virtue.\nThe highest Virtue and the highest Dao are one.\n\nTo grasp it is to live;\nTo lose it is to die.\n\nThe Sage abides before Virtue and the Dao,\nThus knows neither birth nor death.\n\nCommon folk dwell after Virtue and the Dao,\nThus know birth and death.\n\nTo grasp it requires no taking;\nTo lose it is beyond recovery.\n\nTo dwell in the absence of Virtue and taking—this is to attain the Dao.\nTo act and employ—this is to attain Virtue.\n\nHow much more so for those who, amid their very existence,\nFail to grasp the floating, boundless nature of Virtue and the Dao,\nAnd drift through life and death, their vital essence wandering—\nThese are countless, and thus Laozi spoke of the *Dao Jing* and the *De Jing*.\n\n**Chapter 38**\nThe highest Virtue does not cling to Virtue,\nYet through this very non-clinging, Virtue is employed.\nThe lowest Virtue does not lose Virtue,\nYet through this very clinging, Virtue is lost.\n\nThe Sage of highest Virtue acts without action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nThe Sage of lowest Virtue acts with action,\nYet much is left incomplete.\n\nThe highest Benevolence acts without action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nThe highest Righteousness acts with action,\nYet much is left incomplete.\n\nThe highest Benevolence harmonizes with Virtue,\nYet nothing remains to be done.\nThe highest Righteousness enforces judgments,\nYet there are things to be enforced.\n\nThe highest Rites act, yet none respond,\nSo they forcefully seize and compel.\nThe highest Rites demand response,\nYet none comply.\n\n*Seizing by force* refers to what is now called *unfurling the arm to take*—\nThe Rites are the execution of the Five Constants.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, Virtue arises;\nWhen Virtue is lost, Benevolence arises;\nWhen Benevolence is lost, Righteousness arises;\nWhen Righteousness is lost, the Rites arise.\n\nThe Rites are the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nYet they are the beginning of chaos.\nWhen naturalness is lost, Virtue and deeds arise;\nWhen Virtue and deeds are lost, Benevolent actions arise;\nWhen Benevolent actions are lost, the path of Righteousness arises;\nWhen the path of Righteousness is lost, Rites and ceremonies arise.\n\nTo uphold Rites and ceremonies is to thin loyalty and trust,\nAnd to lose naturalness—\nThis is the origin of disorder.\n\n**Foreknowledge** is the flower of the Dao,\nYet it is the beginning of folly.\n\nThe foolish of the world see only what is before them,\nNot what lies behind;\nThey covet only the beginning,\nNot the end.\nIt is like a fruit tree—\nThey love only its blossoms and leaves,\nYet do not take its fruit.\n\nThus, the true man dwells in substance, not in the thin;\nIn reality, not in the superficial;\nIn the weighty, not in the hollow;\nIn the fruit, not in the flower.\n\nHence, he discards the latter to take the former—\nDiscards the flower to take the fruit.\n\n**Chapter 39**\nIn ancient times, those who attained *Oneness*:\nThe heavens attained *Oneness* with serene clarity,\nThe earth attained *Oneness* with tranquil stability,\nThe spirit attained *Oneness* with luminous responsiveness,\nThe valleys attained *Oneness* with fullness,\nAll things attained *Oneness* with flourishing growth,\nAnd kings and lords attained *Oneness* to govern and transform the world.\n\nYet when *Oneness* is exhausted—\nThe heavens, without clarity, risk fracturing and ruin,\nThe earth, without stability, risks erupting and overflowing,\nThe spirit, without responsiveness, risks fading and vanishing,\nThe valleys, without fullness, risk draining and emptiness,\nAll things, without growth, risk perishing and extinction,\nAnd kings and lords, without nobility, risk humiliation and downfall.\n\nThus, nobility finds its root in humility,\nAnd height finds its foundation in lowliness.\nNobility shines through humility,\nHeight is revealed through lowliness.\n\nTherefore, lords and kings call themselves *lonely and few*—\n*Poor* (孤), like the hub of a wheel,\nWhere all spokes converge.\nIs this not their rooting in humility?\nOr is it not?\n\nThus, when virtue is perfected, there is no praise—\nLoneliness and fewness are the true marks.\nWhen lords and kings’ virtue extends to all under heaven,\nThey count their virtues not to receive praise,\nBut lest they become polished like jade,\nOr rugged like stone.\nJade is scarce and thus noble,\nStone is common and thus lowly—\nThe virtuous do not seek nobility but seek humility.\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nThe Way moves by returning,\nThe weak are the Way’s use.\nAll things under heaven arise from *Having*,\n*Having* arises from *Non-Having*.\nMotion and stillness align with the Way,\nSoftness and weakness embody the Way.\nAll things are born from *Having*,\nYet return to *Non-Having*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nThe superior person hears the Way and strives to practice it;\nThe mediocre person hears the Way and holds it as if it exists, as if it does not;\nThe inferior person hears the Way and laughs—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Way.\n\nThe superior person is born of pure *qi* and, hearing the Way, strives to practice it;\nThe mediocre person is born of harmonious *qi* and, hearing the Way, holds it as if it exists, as if it does not;\nThe inferior person is born of turbid *qi* and knows nothing of the Way.\nThe Way opposes the common, so it is met with laughter.\n\nThere is a saying:\nWhen the Way is first spoken,\nIts clarity seems like darkness;\nAfter the Way is made clear,\nIt seems like perpetual obscurity.\nAdvancing the Way appears as retreat,\nHiding one’s traces and concealing one’s name\nIs how one truly advances the Way.\nThe Way’s equality is like that of the common,\nThe great Way is level and just, like ordinary things.\nGreat virtue seems like the vulgar,\nThough virtue resides above, it does not abandon the common.\nGreat purity seems like shame,\nThe most virtuous appear as if dishonored.\nGreat breadth seems insufficient,\nVirtue vast as the heavens still seems lacking.\nEstablishing virtue seems like theft,\nThose who build virtue act as if stealing, fearing others’ knowledge.\nTrue substance seems false,\nThe genuine appears as if corrupted.\nThe most square has no corners,\nThe greatest boundaries are boundless.\nGreat vessels take long to form,\nThose who craft the grand cannot rush completion.\nThe greatest sound is without tone,\nThe mightiest thunder does not roar endlessly.\nThe greatest form is shapeless,\nThe grandest symbol—heaven and earth—has no fixed shape.\nThe Way is hidden, nameless.\nOnly the Way\nLends freely and fulfills.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nThe Way gives birth to *Oneness*,\n*Oneness* gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nThe Three gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,\nAnd through their clashing *qi* find harmony.\nWhat people detest—\nLoneliness, fewness, the hub of the wheel—\nIs what kings and lords claim as their name.\nThus, some things are diminished to benefit,\nAnd benefited to diminish.\nThe Way gives birth to *One Qi*,\n*One Qi* gives birth to the Two Poles,\nThe Two Poles give birth to the Three Powers,\nThe Three Powers give birth to all things.\nAll things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,\nUsing clashing *qi* to harmonize above and below.\nTaking loneliness and fewness as the model of kings and lords,\nThe principle of diminishing and benefiting is the way of all things.\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach as my principle.\nThe overbearing meet no good end.\nI shall make them my lesson,\nUsing the overbearing as a warning\nTo keep all steadfast in softness and weakness.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nThe most gentle under heaven\nOvercomes the most rigid under heaven.\nSoftness overcomes hardness—\nThere is no entering where there is no gap,\nThus one knows the benefit of *wuwei*.\nThe teaching of *wuwei* is without words,\nIts benefit is without action—\nFew under heaven attain it.\n*Wuwei* enters where there is no gap,\nThe benefit of *wuwei* is without action—\nFew under heaven attain it.\n*Xi* means few.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nWhat is more cherished—name or body?\nWhat is more abundant—body or wealth?\nWhat brings greater suffering—gain or loss?\nThus, the more one loves excessively, the greater the expenditure;\nThe more one hoards, the greater the loss.\nTherefore, one who knows sufficiency is unshamed,\nOne who knows restraint is unharmed,\nAnd thus may endure long.\n\nName is distant, the body is close—\nDo not harm the body to pursue name.\nThe body is few, wealth is much—\nDo not forfeit the body to seek wealth.\nGain brings its own suffering, loss brings its own suffering;\nLove brings expenditure, hoarding brings loss.\nTo endure long, know sufficiency and guard your portion—\nThen you shall not face peril.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nThe fully formed seems incomplete—\nIts use is never exhausted.\nThe utterly full seems empty—\nIts use is never depleted.\nThe perfectly straight seems bent,\nThe supremely skillful seems clumsy,\nThe eloquent seem tongue-tied.\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat,\nAnd clarity-quietude governs the world.\n\nWhen virtue and power are complete,\nTo be called deficient and yielding is proper—\nThus its use is never exhausted or depleted,\nSo the straight seems bent,\nSkill seems clumsiness,\nEloquence seems speechlessness.\nAgitation and heat are names for disturbance,\nCold and stillness are the realm of non-action—\nThe foundation of true principle.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nWhen the Way prevails in the world,\nWarhorses are used for plowing fields.\nWhen the Way does not prevail,\nWarhorses and arms arise in the suburbs.\nA ruler who follows the Way\nDoes not use warhorses but tends the fields.\nWhen the Way is lost,\nWarhorses fill the countryside—\nThis is the love of arms.\nTo tend the fields is to encourage agriculture;\nTo love arms is to harm the people.\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what is forbidden,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is worse than greed.\nThus, sufficiency’s sufficiency is always sufficient.\nThe guilt of desire is the pursuit of one’s will—\nDisaster and blame fall upon oneself.\nIf one does not know sufficiency,\nIt is the love of greed.\nThus, knowing sufficiency,\nAll things are sufficient.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nNot stepping outside, one knows the world;\nNot peering through windows, one sees the Way.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus the Sage acts without going yet knows,\nSees without looking yet is named,\nAccomplishes without doing.\nThe Way of the world is one—\nThe household and the world differ not.\nOnly cultivate the inner,\nAnd the outer is known.\nThe Way of Heaven and the Way of Man unite—\nOnly cultivate the self,\nAnd the Way of Heaven must respond.\nWhat need is there for distant travel or peering through windows?\nThus the Sage does not seek outside,\nDoes not take from what is seen or heard,\nDoes not gain through speech or debate—\nSpontaneously, all is accomplished.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nFor learning, daily increase;\nFor the Way, daily diminish.\nDiminish again, diminish again,\nUntil reaching *wuwei*.\nWhen there is *wuwei*, nothing is left undone.\nTo take the world with non-action,\nYet when action arises, it is insufficient to take the world.\nTo study extensively brings daily gain.\nTo cultivate virtue and power brings daily loss—\nMeaning to diminish desires.\nUntil reaching the state of *wuwei* and non-action,\nThen the hearts of the world are easily taken.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as heart.\nThe people have desires, the Sage acts with *wuwei*.\nWith a heart of *wuwei*, following the hearts of desire,\nThis is in accordance with nature.\nThe good, I treat well;\nThe unkind, I also treat well—thus I gain goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—thus I gain trust.\nThe good, though good, I treat well—\nThe unkind, though unkind, I treat well—\nThus I attain the Way of goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThus I attain the principle of trust.\n\nThe Sage in the world is weary and diligent,\nBlending his heart with the people’s.\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nThe Sage takes pity on them all.\nThe Sage, weary and diligent,\nMerges his heart with the people’s—\nThe people gaze and await his favor,\nThe Sage takes pity on them all.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nBorn, entering death,\n\n「Cultivating the Dao brings forth life; indulging in desires leads to death.\nOf those who seek life, there are thirteen types;\nOf those who court death, there are thirteen types;\nAnd among those who move between life and death, there are thirteen kinds of people.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause the pursuit of life is profound and thick.\nIn this world, birth and death are constants.\nEven if death is three parts out of ten, there remains a path to life.\nEven if life is three parts out of ten, it is still a path to death.\nFor though the desire for life is great, one cannot escape death and birth,\nThus, movement brings one into perilous deathly terrain.\n\nIt is heard that those who practice good *shèyǎng* (nurturing and cultivation) avoid death:\nOn land, they do not meet *xì* (rhinoceros) or *hǔ* (tigers),\nIn battle, they are not struck by armor or weaponry.\nFor those who harm others, the *xì* has horns, the *hǔ* has claws, and weapons have blades.\nBut if the *xì* finds no place to lodge its horn,\nThe *hǔ* finds no place to strike with its claw,\nAnd weapons find no place to fit their blades—\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no deathly terrain.\nOn land, they know dawn and dusk;\nIn battle, they recognize advance and retreat.\nSkilled in self-nurturance, adept at avoiding harm,\nThus, they have no deathly terrain.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nThe Dao is the origin of all things under heaven; it is the Mother of the world.\nHaving obtained its Mother, one knows its children—all things.\nHaving known its children, one must again guard its Mother, guard the Dao,\nAnd thus, throughout life, one will not perish.\nAll things arise from the Dao, so it is their Mother.\nThe Mother must be known to understand its children,\nThe children must be known to understand the Mother.\nGuarding the Mother and children in harmony,\nOne does not lose the Dao, and thus the body remains unharmed.\nSeal its senses—close its eyes and ears—\nAnd shut its gates and doors—\nOne will never labor throughout life.\nOpen its gates, aid its affairs,\nAnd one will never be saved.\nThose who guard the Dao do not prize speech or debate,\nNor do they gaze upon beauty or vice.\nThose who defy it will find no end to their misfortunes,\nNor will their bodies escape toil and weariness.\n\nSeeing the small as *míng* (clear/bright),\n*Míng* perceives its subtleties.\nGuarding softness as *qiáng* (strong),\nUsing its radiance—\nThe Dao returns to its *míng*,\nLeaving no bodily calamity—\nThis is called *xié cháng* (following constancy).\nFor all things, from small to great,\nGuarding softness as strength,\nAction returns to the Dao,\nNever losing its constancy—\nThus, there is no bodily harm.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\nIf I were to be *jiè shàn* (distinctly virtuous) and yet have knowledge,\nWalking the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *shī* (giving/imposing).\nIf I were to know well,\nThere would be the Great Dao.\nWhat I fear is that giving and imposing cannot be done as the common people would,\nFor knowing the Dao is easy, but walking it is difficult.\n\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nYet people prefer shortcuts.\nThe Great Dao is like a plain road,\nBut people do not like to walk it;\nThey all go down the crooked paths.\n\nMorning is most *chú* (clear/empty),\nYet daily it is obscured by change—\nChanging clothes, altering utensils and vessels,\nDelighting in slaves, carriages, houses, and dwellings,\nThe fields are full of sprouts, yet the granaries remain empty—\nThe fields though planted, the granaries though full of crops, are still void,\nSpeaking of extravagant expenditure.\nClothing in fine colors and textures—\nWearing silk, brocade, cotton, and embroidered garments—\nAnd adorning oneself with sharp blades—\nTaking pleasure in bows and swords.\n\n「To loathe food and drink,\nOne has no time to cook and butcher.\n\nWealth and goods are in excess,\nAmassing treasures and riches—\nHoarding gold and jade.\n\nThis is called *dào kuà* (plundering/usurpation),\nIs it not contrary to the Dao?\n\nWhat one takes delight in thus,\nDiffers not from thieves and bandits.\nThose who plunder are not virtuous.\n\n**Chapter 54:**\n*Good at establishing cannot be uprooted,*\nGood at establishing matters—\nThey cannot be torn away.\n\n*Good at embracing does not loosen,*\nGood at embracing the Dao—\nThey cannot be shaken or abandoned.\n\nDescendants sacrifice at the ancestral mounds without ceasing.\nThose with virtue—\nTheir descendants, generation after generation, never cease in sacrifice.\n\nPractice it upon oneself,\nAnd its power becomes true;\nTrue and unerring.\n\nPractice it within the family,\nAnd its power overflows;\nVirtue and deeds abound.\n\nPractice it in the village,\nAnd its power endures;\nIts influence is long-lasting.\n\nPractice it in the state,\nAnd its power flourishes—\nAll things prosper.\n\nPractice it throughout the world,\nAnd its power becomes universal.\nIts virtue and blessings are far-reaching.\n\nTherefore, observe oneself with the Dao,\nTo cultivate oneself brings fortune,\nTo neglect it brings misfortune.\n\nObserve the family with the Dao,\nTo cultivate the family brings harmony,\nTo neglect it brings chaos.\n\nObserve the village with the Dao,\nTo cultivate the village brings peace,\nTo neglect it brings strife.\n\nObserve the state with the Dao.\nTo cultivate the state brings good governance,\nTo neglect it brings ruin.\n\nObserve the world with the Dao.\nTo cultivate the world brings unity,\nTo neglect it brings fragmentation.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this—\nThe sage uses this Dao,\nTo observe the world.\n\n**Chapter 55:**\n*Discarding virtue’s depth,*\nComparable to an infant.\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce birds and wild beasts do not attack.\n*Plunderers* do not harm.\n\nDeeply yielding, containing virtue—\nAlways like an infant,\nWith no scheming toward things,\nThus birds and beasts see them and do not harm.\n\n*Attack* is akin to harm.\n\nBones weak, sinews soft yet grip firm—\nAn infant is soft and weak,\nThough soft and weak, yet able to hold fast and solid,\nFor *primordial qi* is present.\n\nNot knowing the union of *playing yin* (dark/soft principle),\nYet *jùn* (complete) in essence—\n*Qi* is refined and solidified.\n\nCrying all day yet voice does not scatter—\nThe utmost harmony.\n\n*Playing yin*, the Dao of husband and wife.\nWhat they do not yet know,\nThen *zhēng* (pure) essence remains constant.\nCrying yet not scattering—\nSpeaking of harmony in *qi* being achieved.\n\nKnowing harmony is called *constancy*,\nNurturing life is called *deliberation*—\nCarefully measuring essence and *qi*.\nThe heart directs *qi*—\nCalled *strengthening*.\n\nNot directing it, it abides.\nThings grow strong, then age—\nCalled *not the Dao*.\nNot the Dao comes early.\n\nAble to know harmony in *qi* always present,\nUse the heart to deliberate carefully,\nTo make resources benefit the body as *strengthening* and clarity,\nAnd long preserve softness and weakness—\nStrongness is *not the Dao*.\n\n**Chapter 56:**\n*The wise do not speak,*\nThose who speak are not wise.»\n\n**Chapter 57:**\nSeal its openings,\nClose its gates,\nDull its sharpness,\nRelease its anger,\nBlend its radiance,\nMerge with the dust—\nThis is called *mysterious unity*.\n\nThus, it cannot be made close,\nCannot be made distant,\nCannot be made beneficial,\nCannot be made harmful,\nCannot be made noble,\nCannot be made lowly—\nTherefore, it is held in highest esteem by the world.\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nFor they guard the Dao.\nThe unwise speak constantly,\nYet seek to enact their Dao.\n\nThe wise seal openings and close gates,\nDull sharpness and release anger,\nBlend radiance and merge with dust—\nThus, they have no close or distant,\nNo benefit or harm,\nNo nobility or lowliness,\nAnd align with the Dao in *mysterious virtue*,\nTherefore attaining the world’s highest esteem.\nThe unwise do the opposite.\n\n**Chapter 58:**\nGovern the realm with *non-action*,\nConquer with *unexpectedness*,\nTake the world with *inaction*.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nFrom this:\n*Non-action* can govern the realm,\n*Unexpectedness* can wage war.\n\nIn waging war, the general employs strange strategies,\nDrives the enemy to death’s ground—\nDo not show them pity or sincerity.\nIn governing the realm, to bring peace to the people,\nDo not display cunning or deceit.\nFirst remove your own calamities,\nThen you may expand territory and open borders.\n\nThe Sage knows these two principles,\nThus governing is as it is.\n\nThe world abounds in taboos,\nYet people grow ever poorer;\nTaboos multiply, rebellions arise—\nThus, laws are established.\nTaboos do not follow desire,\nThus punishments are enforced.\n\nPeople wield many sharp tools,\nAnd the state grows ever more confused;\nPeople use benefit and harm as tools—\nThis is the confusion of governance.\n\nPeople abound in cleverness,\nAnd strange things proliferate;\nWhen cleverness and novelty flourish,\nStrange things arise to deceive the masses.\nLaws proliferate, yet thieves and robbers multiply.\nThieves and robbers rise in number,\nBecause they fear the laws and act accordingly.\n\nThus the Sage says:\nI act with *non-action*, yet people transform themselves.\nI impose no order, yet all is accomplished.\nI take no action, yet people prosper—\nEach follows their own desires.\nI love stillness, yet people govern themselves—\nNo laws are set to oversee them.\nI desire nothing, yet people return to simplicity.\nNo artificial teachings are established,\nYet none dare to presume knowledge.\n\nThe governance grows sluggish, and the people grow dull;\nThe governance becomes meticulous, and the people grow deficient.\n\nWhen governance is sluggish, the people grow quiet and docile.\nWhen governance is overzealous, the people grow mutilated and incomplete.\n\nCalamity and fortune dwell as companions;\nFortune hides within calamity.\nWho can truly know their limits?\nPeople lean toward calamity, yet cultivate virtue to aid them.\nUnknowing of fortune’s birth, they invite calamity instead.\nThus, when there is no governance,\nThe people lose their order.\n\nWhen governance becomes contrived, virtue turns to idle talk.\nThe people’s confusion grows ever deeper.\nTherefore, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nSharp yet does not soil,\nStraight yet does not overreach,\nBright yet does not dazzle.\nWhen governance fails to harmonize,\nGovernance becomes deceitful trickery,\nVirtue becomes chaotic confusion,\nAnd the people’s bewilderment endures.\nThe Sage is square and round yet does not cut,\nPrudent yet not impure,\nUpright yet not aggressive,\nConcealing brightness yet not blinding.\n\n---\n\nTo govern people and serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses adhering to the *Dao*.\nOnly by adhering does one lie low early.\nTo lie low early is to accumulate virtue deeply,\nTo accumulate virtue deeply is to be ever full,\nTo be ever full is to know no bounds.\nTo know the bounds is to govern a realm.\nThe mother of governing a realm is the *Dao*,\nAnd it endures eternally.\nDeep roots and firm foundations—\nPlant its roots deep, lest they be uprooted.\nThe *Dao* of enduring life and long vision.\n\nTo govern human nature and follow Heaven’s timing,\nNothing surpasses adhering to laws and patterns,\nThus all things submit early.\nAfter submission comes deep virtue accumulation,\nVirtue accumulation fills all things,\nNo one knows their limits.\nTo know the limits is to govern a realm,\nThen to become its mother.\nDeep roots and firm foundations—\nTo preserve the state, vast and enduring.\n\n---\n\nTo govern a great realm,\nTreat it as you would a delicate dish—\nA delicate dish requires careful handling.\nWhen the *Dao* is applied to govern the world,\nIts spirits are not feared.\nNot that its spirits are not feared,\nBut that they do not harm people—\nNot that they do not harm people,\nBut that the Sage does not harm people.\nWhen neither harms the other,\nVirtue returns in exchange.\nThe Sage above, and beasts and fish follow their nature—\nHow much more so the people?\nWhen the *Dao* governs the world,\nThe seasons harmonize, and excess or harshness do not arise,\nThus the spirits cannot become malevolent.\nAll things have their spirits,\nAnd when they become spirits, they harm people.\nOnly the true spirit does not harm,\nThe Sage embodies the *Dao* and does not harm,\nThus virtue returns in exchange.\n\n---\n\nGreat realms are the confluence of the world,\nThe outskirts of the world,\nThe world’s outskirts are receptive—\nReceptive, like the female.\nThe female is yielding, and yielding overcomes the male.\nThe male is strong, and strong is overcome by yielding.\nGreat realms, like rivers flowing downward,\nAll things gather there.\nThe world unifies, and the four quarters become its outskirts,\nEver victorious through yielding.\nThus, great realms submit to small realms and take them,\nSmall realms submit to great realms and gather under them.\nThus, some submit to take, others submit to gather.\nGreat realms desire only to nurture people,\nSmall realms desire only to serve them.\nBoth obtain what they desire—\nGreat realms desire to nurture, small realms desire to serve.\nThus, the great should submit.\n\nGreat realms treat small realms with propriety,\nSmall realms treat great realms with propriety.\nGreat realms desire to nurture people,\nSmall realms desire to serve them.\nThough both have desires, the great should submit to take.\n\n---\n\nThe *Dao* is the hidden essence of all things,\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\nIts depth is unmatched.\nThe virtuous cherish it as their treasure,\nThe unvirtuous cannot preserve it.\nFine words can be sold,\nNoble conduct can elevate one.\nThe skillful give and take.\nWhy abandon those who are unvirtuous?\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established,\nAnd the Three Ministers are appointed.\nThe Son of Heaven governs the Three Ministers,\nThe Three Ministers govern the myriad offices,\nThe myriad offices govern the people—\nThus, no one is abandoned.\nThough one may possess a jade tablet and four swift horses,\nIt is not as precious as yielding to this *Dao*.\nThe *Dao* and the four swift horses with jade tablet can both be used,\nYet only those who cultivate the *Dao* do not need to go themselves.\nAnciently, why was this *Dao* so honored?\nWas it not for seeking to obtain and avoiding guilt?\nThus, it is prized by the world.\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Do not needlessly walk the great *Dao*,\nYet benefit all—\nOnly avoid guilt and presumption,\nAnd that is true nobility.\"*\n\n---\n\nTo act without action is to act without contrivance,\nTo govern without governance is to labor without toil,\nTo savor without taste is to embrace simplicity.\nGreat and small, many and few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nThe great and the small, the many and the few—\nAll are served by virtue, and none will harbor grudges.\nDifficult things begin with ease,\nGreat things arise from the minute.\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin with ease,\nGreat deeds must arise from the small.\nLight promises bring few fulfillments,\nEasy words lead to later failure.\nMuch ease brings much difficulty.\nWhat seems simple in execution often fails in completion.\nThus, the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,\nAnd so never faces true difficulty.\nTesting through all difficulties,\nThen achieving success through virtue.\n\n---\n\nWhat is settled is easy to preserve.\nWhat is not yet manifest is easy to plan.\nWhat is woven is easy to unravel.\nWhat is minute is easy to disperse.\nAct before it exists,\nGovern before it is disordered.\nTo govern disorder before it arises,\nTo act before it is complete—\nTo prepare for the unforeseen.\nA tree thick as an embrace begins as a shoot;\nA nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth;\nA height of a hundred *ren* begins at one’s feet.\nFrom the minute to the manifest,\nFrom the small to the great.\nThose who act destroy it,\nThose who grasp lose it.\n\nThe Sage acts without action, hence no failure.\nThe Sage does not grasp, hence no loss.\nHumans, in their undertakings, often succeed at the subtle and fail at the manifest.\nTo treat the end as carefully as the beginning—then there will be no failed undertakings.\nThe common people, clinging to desires, act and thus stray.\nThe Sage acts without action, seeing neither decline nor flourishing.\nThe common people cannot reverence the beginning nor carefully treat the end; as soon as they plan to act, they are already doomed to failure.\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth;\nLearns without learning,\nPrepares for the faults of others,\nAnd aids the natural unfolding of all things without daring to act.\nTo desire when one should not desire,\nTo learn when one should not learn,\nTo not value wealth and possessions,\nTo not covet fame and rank—\nThus, one prepares for the faults of others,\nAnd aids the completion of all things,\nBringing them to their natural state—\nThis is the essence of the Sage.\n\n**Chapter 65**\nThe ancients who were skilled in the Dao did not enlighten people,\nBut sought to delight and bring them joy.\nThe difficulty of governing people lies in their knowing,\nFor knowing creates distinctions.\nTo govern with wisdom is ruin for the state;\nTo govern without wisdom is to enrich the state’s virtue.\nKnowing these two—governing with wisdom and without—\nIs the standard and fixed law.\nTo always know the standard is called the profound virtue of governing the profound.\nDeep and far-reaching virtue,\nOpposing the ways of things,\nOnly then reaches the great harmony.\nThe ancients who governed did not force people to distinguish good and evil,\nBut only wished to make them joyful, without knowledge or awareness.\nIf they had knowledge, they would be difficult to govern.\nWisdom breeds deceit; deep cunning is a thief, the source of harm.\nThe profound virtue employs the standard,\nExhausting all circumstances,\nReturning to great harmony.\n\n**Chapter 66**\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys\nIs that they excel in humility,\nThus they become kings of all valleys.\nRivers and seas flow downward,\nAnd all valleys return to them.\nThus, the Sage wishes to be above others by speaking humbly;\nThis is called compassionate concern.\nThe Sage wishes to lead others by placing himself last;\nThis is called aiding and guiding.\nThus, when in a high position, he does not burden others with heavy demands;\nWhen in the forefront, he does not harm others.\nTherefore, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.\nBecause he does not contend,\nNone under heaven can contend with him.\nThe Sage in office has a mind to serve below and honor above,\nIn the forefront has the virtue of placing others first and himself last—\nNone grow weary of him,\nAnd all willingly follow daily—\nWho could contend with him?\n\n**Chapter 67**\nAll under heaven consider me great, yet I do not laugh.\nOnly because I am great do I seem not to laugh.\nIf I laughed for long, I would be small.\nThe Dao is the greatest under heaven,\nThus it cannot be laughed at or compared.\nBecause it is great, it is not laughed at or compared.\nIf one laughs at or compares it for long,\nThen it is indeed small.\nI have three treasures, which I hold fast:\nThe first is compassion,\nThe second is frugality,\nThe third is not daring to be first under heaven.\nWith compassion, frugality, and not being first as my three treasures,\nThe Sage holds them as precious.\nCompassion makes one courageous—\nCompassion saves all things, hence courage arises.\nFrugality makes one abundant—\nFrugality moderates use, hence abundance arises.\nNot daring to be first makes one a vessel and leader—\nNot being first is humility, hence one attains leadership.\nNow, to abandon compassion and courage,\nTo abandon frugality and abundance,\nTo abandon placing others last and oneself first—\nThis is the path to death.\nNow, to be courageous without compassion,\nAbundant without frugality,\nFirst without placing others last—\nThis is the path to death.\nCompassion, when arraying troops, brings order;\nWhen defending, it secures cities.\nHeaven, about to save them, guards with compassion.\nTroops arrayed with compassion do not kill;\nCities defended with compassion are not harmed.\nIn accordance with Heaven and the people,\nThere is natural salvation and protection.\n\n**Chapter 68**\nThe ancients skilled in being a scholar did not rely on martial strength,\nBut established the Way of governance.\nSkilled warriors do not rage nor glorify slaughter.\nSkilled in defeating enemies, they do not contend;\nTheir formations are without battle.\nSkilled in using people, they place themselves below.\nWhen two armies meet, ritual stands between them.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called the strength of using people,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ancient ultimate.\nMartial strength is used to settle difficulties;\nSkilled rulers have no difficulties,\nThus they do not glorify martial strength.\nIf matters cannot be resolved by oneself and arms are used,\nOne does not rage at the enemy,\nDoes not contend with the foe,\nBut submits with ritual,\nSeeking victory without aggression—\nThis is the ancient ultimate law.\n\n**Chapter 69**\nThere are words about using arms.\nThe ancients said:\nI do not dare to seek to be the aggressor, the first to bring calamity,\nBut to be the responder.\nI do not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.\nI have no intent to seize.\nThis is called having no course of action,\nYet having orders.\nTo sweep away without arms,\nYet having what is to be gathered.\nTo grasp without weapons,\nYet having weapons without using them.\nTo have no enemy.\nBy law, how can there be an enemy?\nThe greatest calamity is to insult the enemy—\nThis is lightness in facing the enemy.\nTo insult the enemy risks losing one’s treasure—\nOne’s own troops.\nThus, when opposing forces clash,\nThe compassionate prevail over the cruel.\nThough skilled in war and facing no equal,\nIf one is lighthearted toward the enemy, one will lose oneself.\nWhen two armies clash,\nThe yielding overcomes the strong.\n\n**Chapter 70**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nWithout selfishness, there is no difficulty.\nYet none under heaven can know or practice them—\nThey are profound and subtle.\nWords have their origin,\nAffairs have their master.\nSpeaking follows the origin,\nActing follows the master.\nOnly because of their lack of knowing,\nNone know me.\nThe world has what it does not know,\nAnd the Sage cannot know it either.\nFew know me,\nThus I am precious.\nFew know the Dao,\nThus the Dao is precious.\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing the Dao.\n\n「Obtaining the Dao/Way is indeed so.\nTo not know what one knows is a sickness.\nForcefully discard understanding and insight.\nThe Sage does not fall ill,\nFor there is no thought or concern.\nBecause of their sickness of knowing,\nThey do not fall ill.\nTheir sickness lies in what they know,\nThus they attain no sickness.\n\n**Chapter 72**\nIf people do not fear great threats,\nThen great threats will come upon them.\nMove with caution in all undertakings,\nAnd there will be no great mistakes.\nDo not restrict your dwelling,\nNor harbor resentment and sorrow.\nAlways maintain moderation in taking.\nDo not exhaust what you are given.\nLife’s span is limited—\nWhy press and force it?\nOnly because one does not exhaust,\nDoes one not exhaust.\nThus one may attain longevity.\nTherefore, the Sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nHe does not seek fame or recognition—\nSelf-knowledge is his own worth.\nHe does not covet glory and splendor—\nSelf-nobility is his own honor.\nDiscard that, embrace this.\nDiscard that and life will perish,\nEmbrace this and the Dao/Way will be gained.\n\n**Chapter 73**\nBrave but daring leads to death,\nCowardly retreat brings survival.\nBrave but not daring leads to life.\nCarefully measure what is fitting.\nThese two paths—\nOne may benefit, one may harm.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nWho knows its reason?\nPeople do not know Heaven’s Dao/Way:\nThe noble hold no desires,\nAvoiding benefit and harm.\nHeaven’s Dao/Way:\nDoes not contend yet prevails,\nDoes not speak yet responds well,\nDoes not summon yet comes of its own accord,\nDoes not command yet plans are fulfilled.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it does not lose its prey.\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is ever robust,\nThus it overcomes itself and responds,\nComes and plans on its own.\nThough myriad things exist,\nBound by Heaven’s Dao/Way—\nWhere else could they go?\nThus there is no oversight or loss.\n\n**Chapter 74**」\n\n**Chapter 75**\nPeople do not commonly fear death—\nWhy then use death to frighten them?\nFew in the world escape harm unscathed.\nMany indulge in greed and excess,\nUnafraid of law and punishment—\nThis is because they do not fear death.\n\nIf people did not fear death,\nAnd yet were to act strangely,\nI would test them and kill them.\nIf people do not fear death,\nAnd yet the world has those who act strangely—\nHow could I kill them in turn?\nWho would dare?\n\nWho would dare kill one who knows death?\nThose who execute kill.\nThose who wield the law—\nTo act as the executioner’s substitute\nIs to act as the master carpenter’s axe.\nThose who wield the law wield power.\nTo act as the master carpenter’s axe,\nFew escape unharmed.\nEven the master carpenter sometimes injures his hand—\nSometimes lightly, sometimes gravely.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 76**\nPeople starve because their rulers tax them heavily.\nHeavy taxation is the cause.\nPeople are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively.\nHarsh laws oppress them.\nPeople grow indifferent to death because life is made too luxurious.\nThey indulge in tastes and hoard jewels and gold.\nOnly those who do not cling to life are truly noble in valuing it.\nThose who seek life excessively perish.\nThose who seek life sparingly live.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 77**\nWhen alive, humans are soft and weak;\nWhen dead, they are stiff and strong.\nWhile spirit and soul remain, they are soft and weak;\nWhen scattered, they become stiff and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nWhile living, are soft and yielding.\nWhile dying, they wither and decay.\nQi preserved, they are soft and weak;\nQi exhausted, they wither and decay.\nThus, the stiff and strong belong to death,\nThe soft and weak belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nStrong trees split.\nArmies must harmonize with the people,\nTrees must be of moderate strength.\nThus, the strong and mighty are beneath,\nThe soft and weak are above.\nBranches and twigs are above,\nRoots and trunks are below.\nSoldiers are in the front,\nCommanders are behind.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 78**\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow:\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\nBut human affairs are not so:\nThey diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.\nHeaven values harmony and compliance,\nA bow values balance and uniformity—\nNo bias toward large or small,\nNo disparity between high and low.\nBy this, the world is governed—\nThis is called *Great Peace*.\nHuman affairs are not so:\nThey honor the strong and suppress the weak,\nFavor the few and serve the many—\nThis is called *seizing power*.\nWho can serve the world with what they have in excess?\nOnly the Daoist.\n\nDivide what is above to aid what is lacking.\nThus, the Sage acts without claiming credit,\nAchieves without dwelling on success—\nThis is why they are not esteemed.\nThe Sage pushes merit forward and declines rewards,\nExtending virtue to the worthy and the good.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 79**\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,\nYet nothing surpasses it in attacking the firm and strong.\nIt cannot be replaced.\nWater can temper steel—\nIt cannot be altered.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFew in the world know this,\nFewer still can practice it.\nYin consumes Yang,\nThe soft overcomes the strong—\nFew in the world know this,\nFewer still can practice it.\n\nTo bear a nation’s impurities—\nThis is called the *Lord of the Soil*.\nTo bear a nation’s misfortunes—\nThis is called the *King of the World*.\nStraight speech seems contrary.\nWhen a nation faces hardship, the feudal lords bear it.\nWhen the world faces calamity, only the King governs it.\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of governance*.\n\n「To reconcile great grudges, there must be lingering grudges—\nHow can this be considered good?\nIf there are grudges and hatred first, then only later can they be settled—\nThis is still insufficient to be called good.\nThus, the Sage holds only the *left contract* (契), not the *right* (符),\nDemanding nothing of others,\nSo the virtuous govern contracts (契),\nThe unvirtuous govern tracks (辙).\nThe virtuous in all things align with others in harmony (符契),\nDemanding nothing of others.\nThe unvirtuous always seek to force others into conformity (合辙),\nThus incurring grudges and enmity (怨雠).\nTracks (辙) are like footprints (迹).\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven has no favorites,\nAlways aligning with those who speak in the *departing voice* (去声) of goodness.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven has no partiality or distance,\nAlways aligning with the virtuous in shared power (合德).\n\n**Chapter 80**\nIn small states with few people,\nThere are countless skilled and intelligent individuals yet unused, untrusted—\nThey cause others to hold death in reverence and not depart.\nIn small states, the great Dao/Way of governance is not employed,\nYet those with talent and cunning are entrusted,\nEnforcing harsh laws and restraining the people,\nForcing them to risk death and flee to distant lands.\nThe Sage, wishing to enact the great Dao/Way,\nDoes not rely on talent and cunning,\nBut makes others hold death in reverence and not go.\nDepart (徙) is to move (移).\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nThere is no place to embark;\nNo labor of movement.\nThough there are arms and armor,\nThere is no place to array them;\nNo warfare.\nThey return to using knotted cords (结绳),\nReverting to simplicity (还淳).\nSweet their food, fine their clothing—\nNo hunger, no cold.\nSecure their dwellings, content their customs—\nFamilies well-provided, people at ease,\nNo levies or forced labor.\nNeighboring states are visible to one another,\nFour borders unassailed.\nCock’s crow and dog’s bark are heard between them,\nNeighbors dwell in close proximity.»\n\nThe Sage lets people live out their days to old age,\nWithout ever visiting one another.\nHe makes each person self-sufficient for life,\nSo that at death, no borrowing or lending remains.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\nTrue words are not ornate;\nOrnate words are not true.\nThey reveal sincerity plainly.\n\nThe wise do not amass knowledge;\nThose who amass knowledge are not wise.\nNo need for inquiry.\n\nThe virtuous do not argue;\nThose who argue are not virtuous.\nNo need for embellishment.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard music;\nWhen exhausted, he gives it to others—\nThe more he gives, the greater his own abundance.\nThe more he possesses, the more he shares—\nThe more he shares, the more he has.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven profits without harming;\nThe Dao/Way of the Sage acts without striving.\n\nThe Sage does not accumulate;\nThe Sage serves others—\nOthers serve the Sage—\nThe Sage shares with others—\nOthers share with the Sage—\nThus, the more they turn, the more they possess.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven profits without harming;\nThe Dao/Way of the Sage holds virtue/power without striving.\n\n*The True Classic of the Dao and Virtue/Power—Subsequent Explanations, Lower Scroll, ends here.*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One (continued)**\nThe character *Dao* is divided into three grades:\nThe highest *Dao* belongs to the **Non-Action, Nameless Great Dao**,\nThe middle *Dao* is the **Formed, Nameable Dao**,\nThe lowest *Dao* refers to the **Ever-Practiced, Applied Dao**.\n\nThat which can be named is not the eternal Name.\nIt too is divided into three grades:\nThe highest Name is the **Name before Naming**,\nThe middle Name is the **Name that can be called**,\nThe lowest Name refers to the **Ever-Practiced, Applied Name**.\n\nWithout a Name, the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nAt first, there was a Name, the Mother of all things.\nBefore Heaven and Earth were divided, it was the beginning of the Nameless.\nWhen clarity and turbidity separated—\nThe clear became Heaven, the turbid became Earth.\nHeaven covered, Earth bore, and all things were within them,\nLike a mother nurturing her children.\nThe Mother is the Great Dao itself.\n\nEver without desire, observe its subtlety;\nEver with desire, observe its peril.\nAll things in the world—\nThe Sage observes their essence and origin,\nThat they arise from the Dao and return to the Dao.\n*Jiǎo* means \"exhausted,\" *miào* means \"born.\"\nThese two, though differing in name, share the same source—\nDesire and non-desire both arise from the Dao.\nThis is called the **Mysterious**.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nThe gateway to all subtleties.\nSince they share the same source, it is called Mysterious.\nWithin it lies all subtlety, making it Mysterious again.\nAll things in the world emerge from this Mysterious gateway.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness already exists.\nAfter all things emerge from the Mysterious gateway,\nThere are five colors to dazzle the eyes,\nFive tones to strike the ears,\nFive flavors to delight the tongue—\nThis is beauty.\nYet the five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors rot the intestines—\nThis is ugliness.\n\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nThen non-goodness already exists.\nMen of the world skillfully devise schemes—\nFrom military strategy to governance,\nFrom the common folk to the ruler,\nAll craftily establish tactics,\nDaily generating countless changes,\nAchieving success and establishing affairs,\nWith applications endless.\nYet schemes first arise in the heart,\nAdaptation exhausts oneself,\nSuccess unmade while life is lost,\nAffairs unestablished while reputation is ruined—\nThis is non-goodness.\n\nBeing and non-being generate each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low depend on each other,\nSounds harmonize,\nDeparture and arrival follow in sequence.\nFrom non-being comes being,\nFrom being comes non-being,\nWhere there is difficulty, there is ease,\nWhere there is long, there is short,\nWhere there is high, there is low,\nWhere there is sound, there is voice,\nWhere there is first, there is last.\nThey generate and complete each other,\nTheir forms and influences interdependently arise,\nTheir harmonies and sequences follow—\nThese six relations in the world\nNever abandon one another.\nThe later text states: *\"The Sage governs by Non-Action,\nThus avoiding these extremes.\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage governs by doing nothing,\nTeaching without words.\nWhen all things act and flourish,\nHe does not claim to be their origin,\nBut precedes them as their servant,\nRelying on the Dao.\nHe does not dwell on success.\nBecause he does not dwell, he does not depart.\nThe Sage governs the world by Non-Action,\nWithout wearying speech,\nAnd all things naturally align.\nAll things flourish without contention for precedence,\nTheir actions leaning on the Dao,\nSuccess and affairs established—\nHe does not reside within them.\nIf he does not reside, his merit does not fade.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three**\nDo not exalt the virtuous,\nSo that people do not contend;\nDo not place oneself above those with virtue and ability,\nSo that people do not vie for position.\nDo not prize rare treasures,\nSo that people do not steal;\nDo not hoard rare wealth,\nSo that there is nothing to steal.\nDo not display what is desirable,\nSo that the heart does not乱 (*luàn*—be disturbed).\nWhen desires do not arise, the mind remains unruffled.\n\nThe Sage governs by:\nEmptying the mind, filling the belly,\nWeakening the will, strengthening the bones.\nEmpty the mind to align with the Dao,\nFill the belly to cultivate virtue,\nWeaken the will to follow nature,\nStrengthen the bones to steady the body.\nEver keep the people in ignorance and without desire,\nSo that the wise dare not act presumptuously.\nEver let the world know Non-Action and non-desire,\nAnd after knowing, they dare not act presumptuously—\nThis is how the Sage governs the world.\nTo govern by Non-Action is to govern all.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is boundless yet used without excess,\nDeep like the origin of all things.\nIt dulls sharpness, resolves anger,\nBlends its brilliance, aligns with dust,\nAnd remains tranquil as if eternally preserved.\n\nThe Dao’s nature is boundless and empty,\nYet when used, it does not overflow—\nIts roots profound, the source of all things.\nThe Sage follows it, and none under Heaven can surpass him.\nThus he dulls sharpness as if foolish,\nResolves anger and remains pure,\nBlends his brilliance and shares the common place,\nAligns with dust and remains unassuming—\nSo he endures tranquilly in the world.\n\nI do not know whose child he is,\nYet he precedes the Emperor.\nThe Sage stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Great Dao,\nThus he is not a man’s son.\nThe Great Dao existed before Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the Sage existed before Heaven and Earth—\nHence, he is called *\"the one who precedes the Emperor.\"*\n*\"The Emperor\"* refers to Heaven and

      "translated_text": "「Only the sages and worthies can cultivate it; few in the world are able to practice it.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nHeaven and Earth endure long—\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure long is that they do not generate themselves,\nThus they can endure long.\nHeaven and Earth embody the Dao and thereby give birth,\nThey allow all things to generate naturally,\nThus they can endure long.\nTherefore, the sage places himself behind while his deeds advance,\nSets himself aside while his body is preserved.\nBecause he has no rigid self,\nHe is thus like the soil and can complete his body.\n\nThe sage places his person behind others yet leads them,\nSets himself aside yet upholds the Dao,\nDoes not lord over all things,\nThus all things rely on him as their lord.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nThe highest excellence is like water—\nWater excels in benefiting all things yet does not struggle,\nIt dwells in the evils of all things,\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\nWater’s nature embodies the Dao,\nIts form and substance are gentle and weak—\nIt flows to high places yet rests in low ones,\nFollows the square yet adapts to the round,\nAll evils converge upon it,\nYet it contains and embraces all things,\nDoes not contend with anything,\nBenefits all things,\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\nThe land is good at being low,\nFollowing the land’s form—\nHigh in effort yet low in result.\n\nThe heart is good at being deep,\nWater’s heart is empty and void,\nLike the Dao’s non-substantiality.\n\nIt is good at benevolence,\nWater’s nature has benevolent action,\nExcels in benefiting and aiding all things.\n\nIts speech is good at trustworthiness,\nResponding to things like an echo.\n\nIts governance is good at regulation,\nWashing and cleansing all impurities.\n\nIts affairs are good at capability,\nGreen, yellow, red, and white—\nAll arise from what is needed.\n\nIts actions are good at timing—\nMoving in accordance with the time,\nNever losing their appropriateness.\n\nOnly because it does not struggle,\nThus it has no blame.\nSo, when it does not contend with things,\nThus it has no faults or grievances.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nTo grasp and fill—\nThis is not as good as letting it be.\nTo measure and sharpen—\nThis cannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them.\nRiches and honor lead to arrogance,\nSelf-inflicting their calamities.\n\nWhen name is accomplished,\nWhen deed is fulfilled,\nRetire the body—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nTo hold and act—\nEven if one obtains fullness,\nIt is not as good as stopping.\nTo measure and discern worldly affairs,\nTo gain their sharpness—\nThis is not yet a treasure for the body.\nTo pile gold and amass jade,\nTo fill one’s hall with treasures,\nOne cannot long preserve them.\nTo rely on riches and honor,\nOnly to indulge in arrogance and insolence,\nOne must invite misfortune and blame.\n\nTherefore, the sage accomplishes his deeds and establishes his affairs,\nFollows the Dao of Heaven and Earth and withdraws from them.\n\nThe Dao fills and empties,\nRetreats and reveals—\nIts patterns are undefined.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nTo carry the spirit and embrace unity—\nThe Dao can thus remain inseparable.\nThe spirit is called *hún* (魂),\nThe form is called *pò* (魄).\nThe body is like a carriage,\nCarrying its spirit and form.\n\nTo embrace and guard its unity,\nDay and night to tend and nurture,\nSo that the spirit and form do not depart from the body.\n\nTo focus the *qi* and achieve gentleness,\nOne can be like an infant.\nTo focus and guard the primal *qi*,\nMaking it gentle and weak as an infant,\nWithout distinctions.\n\nTo purify and remove the Mysterious,\nTo preserve the subtle and achieve flawlessness.\nTo wash and cleanse the subtle mysteries,\nMaking them without blemish or disease.\nBlemish is akin to disease.\n\nTo love people and govern the state,\nYet without knowledge—\nOne should entrust to the Great Dao,\nNot awaiting the discernment of knowledge.\n\nTo be clear and fourfold,\nYet without action—\nTo be in accord with non-action.\n\nThe Heavenly Gate opens and shuts,\nYet remains feminine.\nThe Heavenly Gate is the gate of longevity and nourishment.\nAlways guarding the feminine,\nNever becoming the masculine.\n\nTo generate and store—\nTo generate yet not possess,\nTo act yet not rely,\nTo grow yet not slaughter—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe sage generates and lengthens his body,\nStores and nourishes his body,\nDoes not possess his body,\nDoes not rely on his body,\nDoes not slaughter or harm his body—\nThis can be called the Mysterious and Wondrous Virtue.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nYet it is the empty space that makes the carriage’s use.\nTo knead clay and shape vessels,\nYet it is the empty space that makes the vessel’s use.\nTo pierce doors and windows to make a room,\nYet it is the empty space that makes the room’s use.\n\nTo have it for utility,\nTo have no form for wondrous use.\nThis explains how the Dao generates being from non-being.\n\nSuppose one constructs a carriage,\nWith wheels, spokes, and hub—\nWhen it is not yet formed as a carriage,\nThe mind still holds its use.\nLike kneading clay,\nThis is the method for shaping vessels—\nWhen the vessel is not yet formed,\nThe mind still holds its use.\nAgain, like rooms and houses,\nWhen doors, windows, and openings are not yet formed,\nThe mind still holds their use.\n\nAfter form arises,\nIt becomes a means of utility.\nBefore form arises,\nIt can be a wondrous use.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nFive colors blind the eyes—\nBlue, yellow, red, white, and black—\nIf one gazes at external colors,\nHe loses his true vision,\nThis is blindness.\n\nFive tones deafen the ears—\n*Gōng* (宮), *shāng* (商), *jué* (角), *zhǐ* (征), and *yǔ* (羽)—\nIf one listens to other sounds,\nHe loses his true hearing,\nThis is deafness.\n\nFive flavors dull the palate—\nSour, bitter, sweet, salty, and spicy—\nIf one indulges in their tastes,\nHe loses his tranquility and simplicity.\n\nHunting and gallivanting in the fields drive the heart to madness—\nPursuing and taking the lives of things,\nWandering and dissipating the spirit,\nDriving one to frenzy,\nGenerating greedy and lustful desires.\n\nRare and coveted goods obstruct proper conduct—\nGold, silver, and precious treasures—\nThose who love them obstruct their own upright path.\n\nTherefore, the sage cultivates for the belly, not for the eyes,\nThus he discards the latter to take the former.\nTo cultivate for the belly is to refine the inner,\nTo cultivate for the eyes is to refine the outer,\nThus he discards the outer refinement to take the inner cultivation.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nFavor and disgrace, honor and humiliation—\nThese are like sudden alarms.\nHe holds great calamities as dear as his own body.\n\nWhat is meant by favor and disgrace?\nFavor is low—\nWhen one loses favor, it increases.\nTo gain it is like an alarm,\nTo lose it is like an alarm—\nFavor and disgrace depend on each other,\nGain and loss both bring alarm.\n\nThis is called favor and disgrace being like sudden alarms.\n\nWhat is meant by holding great calamities as dear as one’s body?\nThe Five Phases contend and destroy each other,\nThe Four Great Elements invade and harm each other,\nThus they are great calamities.\nThe reason I have great calamities is that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body,\nWhat calamities do I have?\nNot possessing one’s body,\nNot relying on fame and status,\nThus one has no great calamities.\n\nTherefore, one who values his body above the world\nCan be entrusted with the world.\nOne who loves his body above the world\nCan be entrusted with the world.\n\nFavor arises from disgrace,\nCalamities come from the body itself.\nThe sage does not rejoice in favor,\nDoes not fear disgrace,\nThus he has no great calamities.\n\nOne who values his body without disgrace\nCan be entrusted with the world and its affairs.»",

people,\nStillness and composure are the ruler.\nThus, the sage acts throughout the day without abandoning his baggage.\nThis means he embraces the Dao/Way and holds virtue/power,\nLike one carrying heavy baggage.\nThough he has palaces and pavilions of splendor,\nHe dwells in his chambers with serene detachment.\nHow much more so for the king of a great realm,\nWho bears the weight of the world lightly?\nLightness leads to losing one’s foundation in the Dao/Way,\nAgitation leads to losing one’s composure.\nIf the ruler does not hold heaviness,\nHe will lose his Dao/Way;\nIf he is agitated

them.\nGood closure has no gates or bars that can be opened,\nGood binding has no cords or knots that can be untied.\nThere are gates, bars, cords, and knots,\nWhich can be opened or untied—\nBut those bound and closed by the Dao/Way\nCannot be opened or untied.\nThus, the sage always rescues men without abandoning them,\nAlways rescues things without abandoning them—\nThis is the clear principle of succession.\nHe rescues the unvirtuous with virtue,\nGathering them to return to virtue.\nThe sage not only rescues men,\nHe also rescues things—\nThis is the principle of succession made manifest.\nThus, the virtuous man is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nThe unvirtuous man is the resource of the virtuous.\nThe virtuous man teaches the unvirtuous,\nThus he is called their

one is abandoned.\nThough one may possess a jade tablet and four swift horses,\nIt is not as precious as yielding to this *Dao*.\nThe *Dao* and the four swift horses with jade tablet can both be used,\nYet only those who cultivate the *Dao* do not need to go themselves.\nAnciently, why was this *Dao* so honored?\nWas it not for seeking to obtain and avoiding guilt?\nThus, it is prized by the
