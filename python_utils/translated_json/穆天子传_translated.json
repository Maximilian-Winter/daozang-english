  "full_translation": "**The Mu Tianzi Zhuan**\n\n**Title:** *The Mu Tianzi Zhuan* (*The Chronicle of King Mu of Zhou*). Six juan. Attributed to Guo Pu of the Jin with annotations. Base text from *Zhengtong Daozang* (*Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*), *Dongzhen* section, *Jizhuan* category. Collated with the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\n**Preface to the Mu Tianzi Zhuan**\n\n*The Mu Tianzi Zhuan* was unearthed from the tomb at Ji, and Jin scholar Xun Xu collated and edited it into six juan. It includes a preface stating that though its events are not canonical, its language is profoundly ancient and well worth perusal.\n\nIn his own preface, Zimei (Xun Xu) notes that King Mu reigned for a hundred years, and in his dotage, the Grand Historian’s record of his audience with the Queen Mother of the West aligns with many transmitted accounts. Thus, this text likely preserves the full details of that era and cannot be dismissed outright.\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, each feudal lord maintained their own state annals, often filled with convoluted narratives. By the Warring States era, royal authority waned and sagely teachings faded, while recluses advanced heterodox theories, each household espousing its own doctrines. How could such accounts not be convoluted?\n\nThe text records the king’s travels with his Seven Elite Guards, yet his retinue was modest, and his demands upon the realm were few. Unlike the Qin and Han emperors, who mobilized thousands of chariots and emptied the state for their expeditions, King Mu’s self-reckoning of his faults and the admonitions of his guards suggest no such excess. When he ascended Mount Yu to quarry jade, he ordered the Marquis of Xing to oversee the work but refused tribute, adhering to the former kings’ principle of relieving the people’s burdens. When rain and snow fell, he allowed his men to rest, while his Eight Steeds galloped ahead to await him. Only after ten days did he resume his journey—no harsh commands or rigid deadlines were imposed.\n\nFollowing the prosperous reigns of Cheng and Kang, the people lived in peace. Even the virtuous efforts of King Xu Yan, who practiced benevolence and righteousness, failed to sway the realm. This demonstrates that no tyranny or oppressive governance prevailed. Yet the gentleman still considers King Mu’s death in the ancestral temple a great fortune, revealing how precarious the hearts of men truly are. How could such a path be emulated? How could it be emulated?\n\nThose who preserve this text may admire its antiquity, while those who examine its events must carefully weigh its truths and falsehoods.\n\nThis book was once in the collection of Liu Zhenting of Haidai, Attendant of the Southern Terrace. Fearing its loss, he took leisure to collate and correct its errors, then commissioned the Jinling Academy to reprint it, sharing it with scholars of broad learning. I inscribe this at the beginning of the volume.\n\nWritten on the twenty-seventh day of the second lunar month in the *gengyin* year of the Zhizheng reign (1350), by Wang Jianxuan of Northern Yue.\n\n**Preface to the Mu Tianzi Zhuan**\nBy Minister of the Imperial Secretariat, Supervisor of the Palace Writers, and Marquis of Jibei, Xun Xu\n\n**Preface:**\nThe ancient text *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* was discovered in the second year of the Taikang era (281 CE), when Bu Zhun, a resident of Ji County, looted an ancient tomb. The text was written on bamboo slips bound with white silk. According to the ancient measurements I previously established, each slip was two *chi* and four *cun* long, inscribed in ink with forty characters per slip.\n\nJi was part of Wei during the Warring States period. Based on the *Annals* found there, this tomb likely belonged to King Ling of Wei, the son of King Hui of Wei, corresponding to King Xiang in the *Generational Records*. According to the *Records of the Grand Historian: Chronological Table of the Six States*, from the twenty-first year of King Ling’s reign to the thirty-fourth year of the First Emperor of Qin (when books were burned), spans eighty-six years. From then to the second year of the Taikang era, when this text was first recovered, totals five hundred and seventy-nine years.\n\nThe text recounts the travels of King Mu of Zhou. The *Zuo Zhuan* states: \"King Mu wished to indulge his desires, journeying throughout the realm, ensuring all had chariots and horses at their disposal.\" This text records those very events.\n\nThe king loved his tours of inspection. He obtained the steeds Daoli and Lü’er, with Zaofu as his charioteer, to explore the four wildernesses. He crossed the Flowing Sands to the north, ascended Kunlun to the west, and met the Queen Mother of the West—events corroborated by the Grand Historian’s records.\n\nThe Ji commandery’s handling of the recovered texts was careless, resulting in much damage and loss. Though its accounts are not canonical, they are ancient writings and certainly worth perusal.\n\nCarefully transcribed onto two-foot yellow paper, this is respectfully presented. When affairs are settled, may the original bamboo slips and this new transcription together be delivered to the Secretariat for fair copying, to be stored in the Central Repository, with duplicates kept in the Three Pavilions.\n\nWith reverence, this preface.\n\n*Account of King Mu’s Journey to the Heavens*, Scroll One\nWith annotations by Guo Pu of the Jin\nAncient Script\n\nOn the *gui-mao* day, atop Mount Juan, the king drank with the heavens. On the *wu-yin* day, the Son of Heaven marched north and crossed the Zhang River.\n\n\"Crossed\" means \"severed\"; the Zhang River lies today in Ye County.\n\nOn the *geng-chen* day, he reached □, where they offered wine to the Son of Heaven upon a flat boulder.\n\n\"Offered wine\" refers to the act of presenting drink, hence the term *shang*. Thereupon, the Son of Heaven performed the *Guangyue*. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"When Viscount Jian of Zhao fell ill and lost consciousness, after seven days he awoke and said, 'I went to the court of the Thearch, where I took great delight, roaming with the hundred spirits in the Celestial Fishing Terrace. The *Guangyue* was performed nine times, with myriad dances—unlike the music of the Three Dynasties, its sound stirred the heart.'\"\n\nThe meaning of *Guangyue* is explained here.\n\nHe stood without dismounting, meaning he remained standing in his chariot without alighting.\n\nAt the foot of Xing Mountain. Xing Mountain is now located in Shiyi County of Changshan. *Xing* is pronounced like *Xing*.\n\nOn the *gui-wei* day, snow fell, and the Son of Heaven hunted on the western slope of Xing Mountain—a slope of the mountain. There, he encountered the sheer cliffs of Jueping Mountain, where *ping* refers to perilous paths within the valley. Pronounced *sui*.\n\nHe then followed the northern bank of the Hutuo River. The Hutuo River is now north of the Yangshui in Lucheng County of Tengmen. *Tuo* is the second character of *tuotuo* (camel), meaning \"to abandon.\"\n\nOn the *yi-you* day, the Son of Heaven ascended □ to the north and marched against the Quanrong. The *Discourses of the States* states: \"King Mu was about to campaign against the Quanrong. After the sacrifice, Gong Moufu admonished him, but he did not heed the advice and proceeded with the expedition. He captured four white wolves and four white deer and returned. From then on, the distant vassals ceased their tribute.\" The *Bamboo Annals* further records: \"He took their five kings eastward.\"\n\nThe Quanrong □ Hu offered wine to the Son of Heaven on the northern bank of the Dang River. The Son of Heaven rejoiced and □ rewarded the warriors of the Seven Elite Troops. *Cui* means \"to assemble\" or \"to gather,\" akin to the *Records* mentioning \"chariot grandees\"—all referring to those of wisdom and strength gathered as the king’s claws and fangs.\n\nOn the *geng-yin* day, a north wind brought snow and sleet. As the *Book of Songs* says: \"The north wind is freezing, the snow falls in flurries.\" Due to the cold, the Son of Heaven ordered the royal retinue to rest. He commanded the king’s followers to take respite.\n\nOn the *jia-wu* day, the Son of Heaven marched west and crossed the pass of Yu. *Deng* means \"slope.\" It is suspected that *bei* refers to the northern ridge, and *xi* to the western peril, which belongs to Menshan. Pronounced *yu*.\n\nOn the *ji-hai* day, he reached Yanju and Yuzhi’s plains—both likely state names.\n\nOn the *xin-chou* day, the Son of Heaven marched west to the state of Lin. *Lin* is a state name, pronounced *po* with a falling tone.\n\nThe descendants of the Hezong, named Lin Xiangxu (Bojue was Xu’s title; the character *bo* was often written with the wood radical in ancient times), came to welcome the Son of Heaven at the □ of Zhi. They presented ten leopard skins and twelve fine horses. In ancient times, rituals always began with offerings, as the *Records* say: \"First, present the four tanned hides.\" The Son of Heaven sent Jing Li to receive them. Jing Li was one of King Mu’s favored ministers.\n\nOn the *gui-you* day, the Son of Heaven lodged at Qishi, staying one night before fishing west of the river to observe □ of Zhi’s □.\n\nOn the *jia-chen* day, the Son of Heaven hunted at Shen Marsh, where he obtained a white fox and a black-striped beast, which he used to sacrifice to the Hezong. This was in preparation for the river rites, and the unusual catch was thus employed. Emperor Wu of Han, during his suburban sacrifices, once obtained a one-horned white deer, which he deemed an auspicious omen and used in the *liao* sacrifice.\n\nOn the *bing-wu* day, the Son of Heaven feasted by the river’s bend, where *a* refers to the water’s curve. There, he assembled the Six Armies at the southern border of the state of Lin, above Shen Marsh. *Shu* means \"to gather.\"\n\nOn the *wu-yin* day, the Son of Heaven marched west. Moving swiftly, he reached Yangyu Mountain. *Wu* means \"to gallop,\" and *yu* is pronounced *ou*.\n\nThis was the capital of the River Earl Wuyi. Wuyi is Feng Yi, as recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* as Shui Yi. This was the domain of the Hezong clan. The Yellow River is the lord of the Four Floods, and the Hezong took the river as their surname.\n\nHezong Qiaoyao welcomed the Son of Heaven at Yanran Mountain. *Bo Yao* was his courtesy name. He presented gifts of bundled silk and jade, where *lao* refers to the suburban welcoming rites. Five *liang* make one bundle, and one *liang* is now two *zhang*. First, he presented white □, and the Son of Heaven sent Lin Fu to receive them. Lin Fu was Gong Moufu of Lin, the composer of the *Qi Zhao* poem.\n\nOn the *gui-chou* day, the Son of Heaven held a grand court at Yan□ Mountain by the river’s bend. This was likely a gathering of regional officials to announce the impending river rites.\n\nHe then commanded Jing Li, Liang Gu (the grandee of Liang Gate), to lead the Six Armies. *Yu* means \"then.\" The Son of Heaven chose the auspicious day *wu-wu*, as the *Book of Songs* says: \"An auspicious day, *geng-wu*.\"\n\nThe Son of Heaven donned the grand ceremonial attire: the *mian* cap and *zhen* robes. The *mian* is the crown, and the *zhen* is the robe—likely the supreme attire of the queen consort. The emperor’s use of it remains unexplained. *Zhen* is pronounced *hui*. He wore the *qi* sash (the *qi* is a type of *han*, and the Son of Heaven’s was red), the *fu* belt (pronounced *hu*), and the *boliu* jade tablet (three *chi* long, with a shuttle-shaped top, also called *ying* or the Great Jade). *Bo* means \"to gird.\" He was flanked by pendants on both sides, holding a jade tablet and standing southward beneath the *han* (the meaning of *han* is unclear). Zeng Zhu assisted him. *Zeng* means \"double,\" as in the *Records*: \"Your servant Zeng Yan.\" The officials arranged the five sacrificial animals. The types of cattle and sheep are called *sheng*, and a complete body is termed *quan sheng*; some say *quan* refers to pure color. The *Records* state: \"The sacrificial animal is whole and fat.\"\n\nHe presented the jade tablet to the Hezong, and Hezong Boyao received it, facing west to sink the jade into the river. The river’s position is said to be aligned with Kunlun. He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground. *Qi shou* means the head reaches the ground. He then sank the oxen, horses, pigs, and sheep. The Hezong □ invoked the August Son of Heaven, adding *huang* as a term of reverence. The River Earl hailed him, calling: \"Mu Man!\" Using his name was a sign of humility. The word *yan* was likely added later by the chronicler. He said: \"You shall long administer the affairs of the realm!\" This meant King Mu would govern the world for a long time. The Son of Heaven faced south and bowed twice.\n\nThe River Earl hailed him again, saying: \"Mu Man! I show you the jades of Chong Mountain.\" The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* writes *chong* as *lu*, though the pronunciation is the same. This mountain is said to abound in rare treasures. \"I instruct you regarding Kunlun’s □, the Four Level Springs, and the Seventy □.\" These likely describe features of Kunlun Mountain. \"Proceed to Kunlun’s heights to behold the jades of Chong Mountain.\" These were the words exchanged between the River Earl and King Mu. \"I grant you the blessing of the lunar end.\" The month’s end is called *hui*, meaning he bestowed upon him the fullness of fortune.\n\nThe Son of Heaven received the command and faced south, bowing twice.\n\nOn the *jiwei* day, the Son of Heaven held a grand court at Mount Huang, preparing to perform rites for the River and depart. He unfurled the charts and examined the classics, surveying the Son of Heaven’s jade treasures. He reviewed the River’s domain and inspected the ritual diagrams, saying: \"The Son of Heaven’s jades are recorded in the *River Chart’s* texts.\"\n\nThe *jade fruit*—a stone resembling fine jade—is what is called *nüguo*. The *xuan pearls*—*xuan* being a kind of jade, pronounced *xuan*. The *candle silver*—silver with a radiance like a torch. The *yellow gold’s essence*—gold’s essence, like jade’s essence, is its purest essence.\n\nThe Son of Heaven’s jades are worth ten thousand gold; the □ jades, one hundred gold; the officers’ jades, fifty gold; the deer-keepers’ jades, ten gold. From ten thousand gold downward, it should next mention the feudal lords’ jades at one thousand gold and the grand officers’ jades at one hundred gold, but this text is fragmentary. The compiler did not fill in the gaps, leaving the missing text evident.\n\nThe Son of Heaven’s bow, the archers, the *bu* swords, oxen and horses, rhinoceros □ vessels are each worth one thousand gold. The *bu* sword is likely the sword of *Buxian*. The rhinoceros resembles the water buffalo, with short legs and three horns, black in color.\n\nThe Son of Heaven’s horses run a thousand *li*, surpassing men and fierce beasts—these are the black steeds of mighty force. The Son of Heaven’s hounds run a hundred *li*, seizing tigers and leopards—speaking of their sinewy strength and ferocity.\n\n*Wuyao* says: \"Dispatch the winged crows as envoys.\" It says: \"□ crows and kites,\" *lü* pronounced *lü*, meaning crows. The *guan* pheasants fly eight hundred *li*—these are the *hu* pheasants, of the crane kind.\n\nThe named beasts are made to use their feet: the □ runs a thousand *li*; the *suanni* □ and the wild horses run five hundred *li*. The *suanni* is the lion, which also devours tigers and leopards. The wild horse is like a horse but smaller. *Suan* is pronounced *jun*; *ni* is pronounced *ni*. The *qiongqiong ju xu* runs a hundred *li*—it is also of the horse kind. The *Shizi* says: \"The *julu* runs without choosing its ground.\" The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: \"The *Manyang ju xu*.\" These are mentioned together.\n\nThe elk □ runs twenty *li*. From the dust-raising beasts upward, their running distances are ranked in order. It says: \"*Boyao* all delivered the River’s classics.\" *Dian* means rites. All the above matters are recorded in the *River Chart*, which the River Earl used as ritual gifts to honor King Mu.\n\nThen he mounted the *Quhuang* chariot to lead the Son of Heaven, serving as the vanguard to clear the way, pressing onward to the farthest western lands.\n\nOn the day *yichou*, the Son of Heaven crossed the River to the west. There was the Warm Valley and the Pleasant Capital. The Warm Valley was so named because it was warm in winter. In Yan there was the Cold Valley, where the Five Grains would not grow. This was where the River Lord’s clan roamed and resided, a separate domain and settlement of Boyao.\n\nOn the day *bingyin*, the Son of Heaven assembled his officials to present their vessels, convened the administrative officers, and reviewed the fine treasures they had obtained. He then commanded the Duke of Zheng, Zhengfu—the Duke of Zheng being one of the Three High Dukes. The Son of Heaven appointed Zhengfu to take charge of the correct standards. He received the statutes and ordinances—*xian* meaning teachings and commands. As the *Guanzi* says: \"All receive the statutes.\"\n\nHe then employed the team of Eight Steeds—the names of the Eight Steeds are given below—to drink in the midst of the branching islets, where the waters divided into small shoals. *Zhi* means a branching stream, and *zhi* means a small islet, pronounced *zhi*. This was south of the Accumulated Stones, by the Southern River. The Accumulated Stones was the name of a mountain, now located in Jincheng County by the River. The Southern River flowed southeast from the Northern Mountains.\n\nThe Son of Heaven’s steeds were those most excellent among horses. They were: Red Brindle, known in the world as *Qiji*; Black Steed, a horse with a slender neck—*li* meaning black; White Righteousness; Leaping Wheel; Mountain Child; Quhuang; Flowery Bay, so called for its color like flowers yet red (now called *Maobiao*); red ones were called Date Blacks—*zaoli* meaning red; and Green Ear. It is said that the Lord of Northern Tang came to court with a black horse, from which Green Ear was bred. In Wei times, the Xianbei presented a thousand-*li* horse, white with black ears. A yellow one was called Yellow Ear, of the same kind. The Eight Steeds were all named after their coat colors.\n\nAccording to the *Records of the Historian*, Zaofu obtained for King Mu the horses Black Steed, Flowery Team, and Green Ear, with which he drove the royal carriage on his western tour. He met the Queen Mother of the West and, delighting in her company, forgot to return. This account matches the present one as if tallying tokens.\n\nThe hounds were named Heavy Labor, Mountain Cleaver, Reedy Boar, □ Yellow, Southern □, and Coming White—all names of hunting dogs, like the Song Que breed. The Son of Heaven’s charioteers were Zaofu and Sanbai—below, it says Sanbai was the charioteer—and Geng You and Shao Ji.\n\nCao Fu, skilled in charioteering, was enfeoffed by King Mu at Zhao City—this I have not heard before.\n\nIt is said: The Son of Heaven would go forth to the marshes and hunt, fish, and shoot with tethered arrows. *Yi* refers to shooting with a corded arrow.\n\nThe Son of Heaven said: Alas! I, the One Man, am not filled with virtue—*ying* meaning \"full\"—yet I indulge in pleasure, *bian* meaning \"to engage in joyous pastimes.\" Will later generations also recount my faults? King Mu, in his excessive wanderings and neglect of return, spoke thus to admonish himself.\n\nThe Seven Guardians of the Elite addressed the Son of Heaven, saying: \"What later generations hope for is that you not transgress Heaven’s constancy. Uphold the six seasons. Let farmers and artisans prosper, and the year be abundant. Let men and women have clothing and food, free from hunger and cold. Let the hundred clans be secure in wealth—*fu* meaning 'peace.' Let officials and attendants each attend to their duties. Thus, Heaven harms the four seasons, the people of □-state echo the sounds of the kingdom—what need is there for deliberate pleasure? This means that without pursuing joy, joy naturally follows. Why forget one’s intent? Always be vigilant in virtue. Share benefits with the people, and the world will take it as the norm.\"\n\nThe Son of Heaven praised them, approving their words. He bestowed upon them a left-sided ornament of flowered jade—the finest of jade pendants. They bowed twice and knocked their heads to the ground.\n\n*Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, Scroll One ends.\n*Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, Scroll Two.\n\nJin scholar Guo Pu’s commentary on the ancient text:\n\n□ Wuyao states: □ Feng Mozhou dwelled on the northern bank of the Yellow River. *Mozhou* is a personal name, possibly pronounced *Mo*. He was regarded as the lord of the Yin people. *Lord* here refers to the one who presides over certain sacrifices and rituals, indicating shared lineage.\n\nOn the *dingsi* day, the Son of Heaven ascended southwest to the dwelling of □’s lord, where the worthy sages of antiquity once resided. There stood a great tree, *shuoqing*—*shuo* meaning \"great\"—and wild beasts abounded, fit for hunting.\n\nOn the *wuwu* day, the people of □ Julü—*Jü* being the ancient character, *Julü* the name—presented a hundred □ of wine to the Son of Heaven. (*Note: The character for the wine vessel is missing below \"hundred.\"*) After drinking, the Son of Heaven departed and lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the northern bank of the Red Water. The Kunlun Mountains have waters of five colors; the Red Water issues from the southeast corner and flows northeast. (See the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.) There lies the Mountain of the Parrot Crows—*Ying* pronounced *Zhen*, also called *Mei*.\n\nThe Son of Heaven stayed three days at the Mountain of the Parrot Crows. On the auspicious *xinyou* day, he ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor toured the four seas, ascended Kunlun, and built palaces upon it. (See the *New Discourses*.) As for the grand burial of Feng Long—*Long* above may be a miswriting of *Feng*—Feng Long, the diviner’s charioteer, obtained the *Dayu* hexagram of the *Book of Changes* and became the Master of Thunder, much like the Yellow Emperor’s tomb on Qiao Mountain. *Feng* means to mound earth high above, marking it for posterity to witness.\n\nOn the *guihai* day, the Son of Heaven prepared purified and whole sacrificial victims to offer in solemn rites upon Kunlun’s heights. *Zhuo* means purity; *qi* refers to the day of fasting before the sacrifice. As the *Book of Documents* states: “The Son of Heaven fasts for the Six Ancestral Spirits.” *Chou* is pronounced *gui*.\n\nOn the *jiazi* day, the Son of Heaven marched north and lodged at Pearl Marsh, so named for the pearls it yields. (Today, the marshes of Yuelun yield green pearls.) There he fished in the flowing waters. Pearl Marsh spans thirty *li* in circumference—a marsh with grass is called a *sou*. Within it grow *qu* reeds, *guan* rushes, and sweet flags (*guan* and *pu* being variants of the same). Some say *guanpu* is a single name, though in the lands west of the Pass it is called *guan*. (Pronounced *wan*.) There are also taro roots (the character now written as *pu*, pronounced *bei*), *jian* reeds (resembling *qu* but finer, pronounced *jian*), and *po* grasses, a kind of barnyard millet, as the *Book of Songs* says: “In the fourth month, the *yao* grass blooms.”\n\nThen were presented a pair of white jade vessels—one of their three horns could be used for washing—and offered food and ten *fu* of wine, along with nine *guyi* (a delicacy made from elk stomach, smooth to the palate; *zhong* here means “to match”). They also presented three hundred horses fit for the royal kitchen and three thousand head of cattle and sheep.\n\nThe Son of Heaven stationed men at Kunlun—this passage seems to describe the appointment of guardians for the mountain’s flank—to safeguard the Yellow Emperor’s palace, oversee the Red Waters to the south, and protect the treasures of Chong Mountain to the north. This was done to exalt and manifest sagely virtue, thereby making his achievements known to posterity.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon them three or five gold rings (with hollow edges, forming circles), thirty sashes adorned with cowrie shells (as the *Huainanzi* says: “Their cowrie sashes are called *junfan*”), and four *gongbu* textiles. They bowed deeply, touching their heads to the ground in reverence, much like today’s Hu people who, in worshipping the Buddha, raise their hands to their foreheads and say *namo bai* (pronounced *mo*).\n\nThe Son of Heaven further gave them twelve yellow oxen to breed as sacrificial stock and sent thirty men to Kunlun’s heights.\n\nOn the *dingmao* day of late summer, the Son of Heaven ascended Chong Mountain to survey the four wilds, declaring: “Chong Mountain is the loftiest in all the world.” The *zi* trees there bloom in fear of snow, so the Son of Heaven took their blossoms as treasures and carried them back to plant. He said: “The marshes of Chong Mountain yield clear spring waters, warm and still, where black-striped creatures thrive. Here is where birds and beasts come to drink and feed—the place the ancient kings called *Xuanpu*.”\n\nThe *Huainanzi* states: “Kunlun rises eleven thousand *li* above the earth, its summit crowned by nine-tiered walls. Doubling that height is the realm called *Banfeng*; doubling it again is *Xuanpu*, each realm ascending in turn.” The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: “Mingming, Kunlun, and Jingpu are three distinct mountains, though they stand near one another.” It also says: “This is truly the Emperor’s *Pingpu*.”\n\nThere the Son of Heaven obtained the essence of jade, the *Cezhi* branch. *Ying* refers to the finest essence of jade. The *Shizi* says: “Dragon Spring holds jade essence.” The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: “The Yellow Emperor took the jade *ce* from Mount Mi and cast it upon the southern slopes of Mount Zhong.”\n\nHe said: “Chong Mountain is where all beasts gather and birds roost.” There dwelt a certain beast that fed on tigers and leopards, resembling an elk but bearing bony plates upon its back, with a small head and large snout. (*Tang* here means *kang*.) There were also red leopards and white tigers (as the *Book of Songs* says: “Red leopards and yellow lynxes”), bears, brown bears, jackals, wolves, wild horses, wild oxen, mountain goats, and wild boars. (Today, the mountains of Huayin harbor wild oxen and mountain goats, each weighing a thousand *jin*.) There were white crows, green *peng* birds, dogs that herded sheep, and creatures that fed on boars and deer. (Today’s *peng* birds are red and prey on roebucks and deer.)\n\nThe Son of Heaven spent five days observing Chong Mountain’s heights. He then inscribed a boundary marker upon *Xuanpu* to instruct later generations.\n\nTo inscribe upon stone and record merits and virtues—such was the practice of the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, who on their imperial tours ascended famous mountains and set up stone tablets and markers, of which this is an example.\n\nOn the *renshen* day, the Son of Heaven marched west. On the *jiaxu* day, he arrived among the people of Red Crow, who presented to him a thousand *hu* of ale, nine hundred horses for food, three thousand sheep and cattle, and a hundred cartloads of *ke* wheat. (*Ke* resembles millet but does not wither.) The Son of Heaven sent Minister of Sacrifices to receive the offerings, saying: “The lineage of Red Crow first emerged from the Zhou clan, sharing the same ancestral founder. Grand Duke Danfu is the same as the ancient Grand Duke Danfu. He first established the western lands, building his state at the foot of Mount Qi—today’s Mei County in Fufeng. He enfeoffed his eldest son, Tai Bo of Wu, but Tai Bo yielded the throne and entered Wu, whereupon he was enfeoffed there. The edict prescribed punishments with metal blades, for southern gold is keen and refined—thus were their laws framed. Gifts were made with the jades of the Zhou house. (*Hui* means ‘tribute.’) He enfeoffed his minister, Elder Ji Chuo of Mount Chong, at the louse of Chong Mountain, bestowed upon him an eldest daughter in marriage, and prescribed punishments with jade and stone, for Mount Kunlun yields fine jade and stone—thus were their laws framed. He was made lord of the Zhou house.”\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon the people of Red Crow a black-lacquered chariot with four horses (in the *Rites of Zhou*, great officers ride black-lacquered chariots), forty *yi* of gold (one *yi* equals twenty taels), fifty sashes of cowrie shells, and three hundred bolts of vermilion silk. (*Guo* here means ‘bolt.’) *Wu* (a personal name of a Red Crow man) then bowed deeply and received the gifts.\n\nHe said: “This mountain is truly the finest in the world, where treasured jades abide, fine grains grow, and plants and trees flourish in great beauty.” The Son of Heaven thereupon gathered the fine grain and returned with it, planting it in the Central States. (Emperor Wu of Han once took fragrant herbs and fine vegetables from foreign lands and cultivated them in the Central States.)\n\nHe said: “The Son of Heaven rested for five days at the foot of this mountain and then performed grand music.” The man of Red Crow, *Wu*, offered his daughter to the Son of Heaven to forge bonds of favor. The women were named *Ting* and *Lie*, called “jade-like beauties.” (One name is *Ting*; the other name is lost in the text below.)\n\nHe said: “The land of Red Crow is a place of beauties, where treasured jades abide.”\n\nOn the *jimao* day, the Son of Heaven marched north, advancing in leaps and bounds, halting every thirty *li*. On the *gengchen* day, he crossed the Yang River. (The Yang River rises from the northwest corner of Mount Kunlun and flows east. *Yang* is pronounced *xiang*.) On the *xinsi* day, he entered the land of the Cao Nu people, where the state of Xi offered a feast to the Son of Heaven upon the Yang River. (Xi is the name of a state.) They presented nine hundred horses for food, seven thousand sheep and cattle, and a hundred cartloads of *ke* rice. The Son of Heaven sent Feng Gu to receive the offerings. (Feng Gu was a grand officer of Zhou.)\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon the people of Cao Nu of the state of Xi a golden deer, a silver *zun* (objects like jade *zhun* and golden dogs, unearthed from the earth today, were all rare treasures used in antiquity to bribe the barbarians), forty sashes of cowrie shells, and four hundred bolts of vermilion silk. *Xi* then bowed deeply and received the gifts.\n\nOn the *renwu* day, the Son of Heaven marched north and then turned back eastward, returning by way of the eastern route.\n\nOn the *jiashen* day, they reached the Black River, which also flows from the northwest corner of Mount Kunlun and then eastward and southward. This is what the Western Mo call the \"Honglu.\" The Western Mo is a region of the Shamo (sandy desert), and as it lies beyond the frontier, its people and things differ from those of the Central States. As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: \"Shu Gong defeated the army of Ju at the Zi River.\" The *Guliang Commentary* states: \"The Di people call it 'Zi Spring,' losing its proper name and adopting a Chinese one, following the custom of the host.\"\n\nThereupon, rain fell for seven days. The Son of Heaven left behind the remnants of the Six Armies. King Mu’s horses were swift and his charioteers skilled, so he often rode ahead of the multitude. The Son of Heaven then enfeoffed Changgong west of the Black River. These were the Long-Armed People, whose bodies resembled those of the Central States but whose arms measured three *zhang* in length. During the Wei dynasty, a saw belonging to such a person was recovered from the Red Sea. The Land of the Long-Legged People lies further east of the Red Sea. Both are recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nThis place was above the Honglu, and he established it as a domain of the Zhou house, naming it the State of Liugu. Thus, it was so named. On the *xinmao* day, the Son of Heaven marched north, then turned back eastward, following the Black River.\n\nOn the *guisi* day, they arrived at the Mountain of Lush Jade, which is the Palm Jade Mountain recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*—the abode of the Queen Mother of the West. It was guarded by the Rong□ clan and called the \"Drought Jade Fields.\" The mountain’s slopes were level and unobstructed, its borders devoid of peril, its four sides aligned as if by a carpenter’s line. This was what the former kings had called the \"Repository of Strategies,\" where the ancient sage-kings stored their bamboo slips and books—the so-called \"hiding them in famous mountains.\" The land bore sparse vegetation and no birds or beasts, for it was pure jade and stone. There grew □ trees, which the Western Rong called □.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then took three chariot-loads of jade, along with jade vessels and ceremonial objects—including pendants and girdle ornaments. Thus, he loaded ten thousand *zhi* of jade (a *zhi* of jade being called a \"valley,\" as seen in the *Zuo Tradition*). The Son of Heaven rested for four days on the Mountain of Lush Jade (休 here meaning \"to wander and repose\"), then commanded the Marquis of Xing to await the jade-cutters (待 meaning \"to detain\"; Xing is present-day Xiangyi County in Guangping). On the *dingyou* day of the first autumn month, the Son of Heaven marched north. The people of □ secretly presented him with a feast on Feather Mound, offering fine horses, cattle, and sheep. Because their state excelled in jade-cutting, the Son of Heaven did not accept their sacrificial animals, valuing frugality in such offerings. Wutao said: \"The □ clan are descendants of the Jian□.\"\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon them three sets of six golden jars (孟, called *ying* in Xuzhou) and three hundred bolts of red silk. The □ clan bowed deeply and received them. On the *wuxu* day, the Son of Heaven marched west. On the *xinchou* day, he arrived at the state of the Zhiwen clan (pronounced *Yi*). There, he commanded the Zhiwen to provision the Six Armies (the Son of Heaven’s six hosts, as in the *Odes*: \"The Zhou king marches forth, his six hosts following\") at the foot of Iron Mountain.\n\nOn the *renyin* day, the Son of Heaven ascended Iron Mountain and distributed sacrificial vessels to the Zhiwen people, rewarding them with the remnants of the offering. Wen Gui bowed deeply and received them. After the sacrifice, the Son of Heaven departed and continued west. On the *bingwu* day, he arrived at the state of the Yinghan clan, where there were joyous fields of warmth, fertile wheat lands (the character 草 here is written with 阜 below; likely an ancient form of 茂), and abundant dogs, horses, cattle, and sheep (昌 meaning \"flourishing\"). It was also a place where precious jade was □.\n\nOn the *dingwei* day, the Son of Heaven held a grand court in the midst of the level plains (衍 refers to low-lying land near mounds, as in the *Rites of Zhou*). He then commanded the officers of the Six Armies to rest. On the *jiyou* day, the Son of Heaven held a great feast for the Duke of Zheng, the feudal lords, kings, and officers, as well as the elite Seven Troops, in the midst of the level plains. The people of Yinghan, led by Wu Liang, presented one hundred fine horses, three hundred draft oxen, seven thousand well-trained hunting dogs, two hundred *fang* cattle, three hundred wild horses, two thousand cattle and sheep, and three hundred carts of wheat and barley.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon them four sets of seven golden and silver jars, fifty belts of cowrie shells, three hundred bolts of red silk, and carved official insignia (the characters 变□雕官 appear to be an ancient form of \"upper and lower ranks\"; modern barbarian officials often hold dual titles). They bowed deeply and received the gifts. On the *gengxu* day, the Son of Heaven marched west and arrived at the Dark Pool. He rested there for three days, during which he had grand music performed, concluding after three days. That day, it was called the Medicine Pool. He renamed it the Pool of Grand Music, akin to Emperor Wu of Han renaming a village \"Wenxi\" (\"Hearing Joy\").\n\nThe Son of Heaven then planted bamboo by the pool, calling it the Bamboo Grove (a place dense with bamboo and trees is called a \"grove\"). On the *guichou* day, he continued his westward march. On the *bingchen* day, he arrived at Bitter Mountain, which the Western Rong called the \"Luxuriant Garden.\" There, the Son of Heaven rested and hunted, and they ate the *ku* fruit (a small, edible fruit). On the *dingsi* day, the Son of Heaven marched west. On the *jiwei* day, he lodged west of the Yellow Mouse Mountain and continued west. On the *guihai* day, he arrived at the state of the Queen Mother of the West.\n\n*End of Scroll Two of the* Transmission of King Mu.\n\n*Scroll Three of the* Transmission of King Mu, *with annotations by Guo Pu of the Jin.*\n\nOn the auspicious *jiazi* day, the Son of Heaven was received as a guest by the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother of the West had the fangs of a tiger, disheveled hair, and wore a *sheng* ornament; she seemed to be wailing. According to the *Bamboo Annals*, in the seventeenth year of his reign, King Mu marched west to Kunlun Peak and met the Queen Mother of the West. That same year, she came to court as a guest before Duke Zhao.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then presented a white jade tablet and a dark jade disk to the Queen Mother of the West, with attendants offering them as a gesture of respect. He also bestowed upon her a hundred bolts of brocade ribbons and three hundred bolts of *□* ribbons. A *chun* refers to a bolt of cloth. As stated in the *Rites of Zhou*: \"A bolt of silk should not exceed five *liang*.\" *Zu* refers to a type of cord, pronounced *zu*. The Queen Mother of the West bowed twice to receive the gifts.\n\nOn the *yichou* day, the Son of Heaven offered a toast to the Queen Mother of the West at the Jade Pool. The Queen Mother of the West then composed a song for the Son of Heaven, singing:\n\n*\"White clouds drift in the sky,\nFrom the mountains’ edge, peaks emerge on their own.\nThe Way stretches far and distant,\nMountains and rivers stand between us—ah!\nI beseech you, do not die;\nMay you yet return again.\"*\n\nThe Son of Heaven replied to her, saying: \"When I return to the eastern lands, I shall harmonize and govern the Central States, ensuring all the people are equitably settled. Then I shall turn to see you again.\" *Gu* means \"to return.\" \"Within three years, I shall come again to these wilds.\" This means he would return to this wilderness to meet her.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then urged his chariot up Mount Hui—*Yi*, meaning this very mountain, where the sun sets. He inscribed his footprints upon the stone of Mount Yi, carving an inscription and planting a locust tree, marking it as: \"The Mountain of the Queen Mother of the West,\" signifying that this was where the Queen Mother of the West resided.\n\nUpon returning to the western lands, Shimin composed a lament and chanted:\n*\"When I journeyed to the western lands,\"* *Zu* means \"to go.\"\n*\"I dwelt in those wilds,\nWhere tigers and leopards were as grass,\nAnd I dwelt among the crows and magpies.\"*\n*Wu* is read as \"oh.\"\n*\"The noble mandate does not shift;\nI guard this one region.\nI am the Emperor—\nThe Emperor, the Heavenly Thearch—\nYet the Son of Heaven’s great mandate cannot be proclaimed.\nTurning to Shimin’s grace,\nTears stream down like falling stars.\nPlaying the sheng and striking the reed,\nThe reed within the sheng,\nMy heart soars.\nThe sorrow is not slight.\nShimin’s son,\nIs Heaven’s hope—\nThe one upon whom all gaze.\"*\n\nOn the *dingwei* day, the Son of Heaven feasted at Mount Wen, where the *kao* crows dwelt. As the *Bamboo Annals* states: \"King Mu met the Queen Mother of the West, who detained him, saying: 'There are crows boasting of men.'\" It is uncertain what these crows signified; the passage is fragmented and unclear.\n\nOn the *jiyou* day, the Son of Heaven feasted by the Lu River. He then issued decrees and commands—*xian* referring to laws and ordinances—and instructed the Six Armies to gather their feathers. There were marshes and wetlands, hills and plains—great mounds called *ling*, and high, level ground called *lu*. The feathers of the great birds were plentiful.\n\nThe men of the Six Armies all arrived at the vast plain, indicating they were preparing to hunt. As stated below: \"North to the wilds of Kuangyuan, where flying birds shed their feathers.\" The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: \"A great marsh a thousand *li* square, where the *shen* birds are born and shed their feathers.\" The *Bamboo Annals* states: \"King Mu marched north, and the accumulated feathers stretched a thousand *li*.\" All refer to this very plain.\n\nIt is said: \"The Son of Heaven encamped at Kuangyuan for three months.\" Then the Son of Heaven grandly feasted the Duke of Zheng and the feudal lords and kings, commending the Seven Elite Warriors—*le* meaning \"to reward\"—by the Feather Pond. Below lies Feather Mound, which may refer to the same place.\n\nThen grand music was performed, and the men of the Six Armies coursed and hunted across the vast plain—*xiang* meaning \"to roam and follow.\" Their spoils were boundless, *wu jiang* meaning \"without limit.\" Birds and beasts were utterly exhausted, the text meaning they were taken to the fullest. The men of the Six Armies hunted for nine days, then halted at the Feather Marsh’s bank, gathering hides and tallying creatures—*wu* referring to fur and color. As the *Odes* says: \"Ninety kinds of creatures.\" The tribute carts were loaded. *Zhai* means \"to borrow.\" The Son of Heaven thus loaded a hundred carts with feathers. Ten feathers made a *zhen*, a hundred feathers a *fu*, and a thousand *fu* a *yi*, as recorded in the *Rites of Zhou*.\n\nOn the *jihai* day, the Son of Heaven turned eastward for his return, and the Six Armies set forth. On the *gengzi* day, he reached the mountain of □ and rested, awaiting the men of the Six Armies. On the *gengchen* day, the Son of Heaven marched east. On the *guiwei* day, he arrived at Mount Wu□, the dwelling of the Zhi clan. □ Zhi □ visited the Son of Heaven at Mount Wu□, presenting as tribute two bolts of white glue, *shang* (a kind of horse), forty wild horses and wild oxen, and seventy guard dogs—those tasked with defense. They then offered four hundred food horses and three thousand cattle and sheep, calling it the Zhi clan’s tribute. The Son of Heaven traveled north to the Marsh of Lunzi, where the Zhi clan’s husband presented a hundred □ of wine to the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon him two sets of nine vessels: dog-patterned *caiyi* jade, yellow-gold jars, forty belts of cowrie shells, three hundred bundles of cinnabar, and a hundred □ of cassia and ginger. The man bowed deeply and received them.\n\nOn the *yiyou* day, the Son of Heaven marched south, then turned east. On the *jichou* day, he reached the Sworn Waters, then continued east, drinking as they went, and proceeded southeast. On the *jihai* day, he arrived at Mount Gualu, which encircled like a triple-walled city—the text meaning the mountain wound threefold, resembling a fortress. It was the stronghold of the Guan and Hu clans (Guan pronounced *yu*). The Son of Heaven then marched east, crossing the sandy flats to the south. *Sha yan* refers to waters with sand. On the *xinchou* day, the Son of Heaven thirsted in the sandy flats, where no springs flowed. Before drink could be brought, Gao Benrong of the Seven Elite Warriors stabbed the neck of his left shin, drawing its blue blood to quench the Son of Heaven’s thirst. Today, the Qiang and Hu peoples of the west pierce horses’ throats to drink their blood when parched, and it revives them. The Son of Heaven praised him and bestowed a single jade pendant. Benrong bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground (an ancient form of *ji*).\n\nThe Son of Heaven then marched south. On the *jiachen* day, he reached the bank of Mount Ji. There, a man named Minghuai of the Moyu clan presented wine to the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon him a yellow-gold jar, a cowrie-shell belt, and seventy bundles of cinnabar. Minghuai bowed deeply and received them. On the *yisi* day, Zhu Jian presented wine to the Son of Heaven. Zhu Jian was also a man’s name (pronounced like *jian* in \"ox\"). The Son of Heaven bestowed upon him a yellow-gold jar, a cowrie-shell belt, and seventy bundles of cinnabar. Zhu Jian bowed deeply and received them.\n\n*Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, Scroll Three, ends here.\n*Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, Scroll Four, with annotations by Guo Pu of Jin.\n\nOn the *gengchen* day, the Son of Heaven reached the Tao River, the land sustained by the Zhuyao clan. As *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: \"There is a river called San Diao, the land sustained by the Kunwu clan.\" This is of the same kind.\n\nOn the *xinsi* day, the Son of Heaven marched east. On the *guiwei* day, he reached Su Ming and the land clothed by the Gujian clan. It is said that in the valleys grew grasses and trees whose bark could be made into clothing and coverings. Thereupon, he turned south, then eastward again.\n\nOn the *bingxu* day, he reached Chang Dan, the western border of the Chonghu clan. *Jiang* means \"boundary.\" On the *dinghai* day, the Son of Heaven ascended Chang Dan and continued his eastward march.\n\nOn the *gengyin* day, he reached the bend of the Black River in the land of the Chonghu clan, where wild wheat grew naturally. There was also *da dong* (pronounced *qi jin* in two readings), known in the Western Mo region as *mu he* (\"wooden grain\"), a kind of millet five *xun* in height and five *wei* in girth, as recorded in *The Classic of Mountains and Seas*. It was the sustenance of the Chonghu clan.\n\nThere was also the Mountain of Colored Stones, which produced stones of patterned beauty. It was guarded by the Chonghu clan, yielding such treasures as *zhi si*, *xuan gui* (a kind of jade; *xuan* and *hui* in two readings, as in *The Zuo Tradition*: \"He gifted me with *xuan gui*\"), *yao* (also jade; pronounced *yao*), *lang gan* (a stone resembling pearls; *lang* and *gan* in two readings), *lin jie*, *lin yi*, and *lin hao* (all names of jade, though their forms are unattested; *lin jie* pronounced *lin ji*), as well as *yu qi* (a kind of jade), among these two. *Yi wei*.\n\nNone of these were attested elsewhere. All fine stone implements came from this mountain.\n\nIn the first month of autumn, on the day *guisi*, the Son of Heaven commanded the Chonghu clan to provide sustenance for his retinue. The word \"provide\" (*gong*) here implies they were not part of the Six Armies. Five days later, on *dingyou*, the Son of Heaven ascended the Mountain of Colored Stones and there gathered its stones. He ordered the people of Chonghu to smelt them into implements by the Black Waters. Even now, those who forge implements in foreign lands still use such stones. The vessels, garments, ornaments, and adornments were boundless, and the Son of Heaven rested for a month.\n\nOn the autumn day *guihai*, the Son of Heaven feasted the widower *Guanlie* of the Chonghu clan and bestowed upon him two sets of nine jars of gold, one silver raven, fifty cowrie belts, seven hundred bundles of cinnabar, a hundred measures each of cassia and ginger, and silk cords with carved ornaments. *Guanlie* prostrated and received them.\n\nOn *yichou*, the Son of Heaven set out eastward, and *Guanlie* escorted him to the Mountain of Changsha. There, the Son of Heaven ordered Wuyao to receive him. Wuyao said: \"The ancestors of the Chonghu clan were descendants of the Sanmiao clan, who dwelled in [lacuna] and worked with yellow wood, wax, silver, and colored stones. They prostrated and received them.\" The Sanmiao were those exiled by Shun to the Sanwei Mountain.\n\nOn *bingyin*, the Son of Heaven continued eastward and turned south. On *jisi*, he arrived at Wenshan, called [lacuna] by the people of Western Mo, where they feasted the Son of Heaven. The people of Western Mo then presented three hundred horses, two thousand cattle and sheep, and a thousand carts of unhusked rice. The Son of Heaven ordered Biju to receive them, saying: \"[Lacuna] the Son of Heaven roamed Wenshan for three days.\" There he gathered colored stones, and because of these stones, the mountain was named Wenshan.\n\nOn *renyin*, the Son of Heaven drank beneath Wenshan. The people of Wenshan, whose name was *Guiwei*, presented ten teams of fine horses (a team being four horses), three hundred oxen, ninety guard dogs, and two hundred *fang* cattle to traverse the Flowing Sands. These cattle could walk through the Flowing Sands as camels do. The Son of Heaven’s *hao* horses and *hao* cattle—*hao* meaning \"bristled.\" *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: \"The *zi* horse resembles a horse, with four-jointed legs, all covered in hair.\" The *mang* dogs—*mang* meaning shaggy, referring to fierce dogs. Some say *wei* is also a name for dogs. The *hao* sheep resemble *mao* cattle.\n\nThirty offerings were made to Wenshan. The Son of Heaven also bestowed upon *Guiwei* two sets of nine jars of gold, thirty cowrie belts, three hundred bundles of cinnabar, and a hundred hills of cassia and ginger. *Guiwei* prostrated and received them.\n\nOn *guiyou*, the Son of Heaven ordered the harnessing of the Eight Steeds. The right trace horse was *Diliu* (possibly a scribal error for *Bixun*), and the left was *Lü’er*. The right outer horse was *Jiaochilong* (an ancient form of *ji*, \"steed\"), and the left was *Baiyi*. The Son of Heaven’s main chariot was driven by Zaofu as charioteer and Qu Gu as right-hand attendant. The secondary chariot had the right trace horse *Quhuang* and the left *Yulun*, with the right outer horse *Daoli* and the left *Shanzi*. Wuyao was in charge of the chariot, with Canbai as charioteer and Bentong as right-hand attendant.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then soared southeast, galloping a thousand *li* in a single sweep of the reins, his movement like flight. He arrived at the land of the Minister of Search’s people, *Gounu*. They presented the blood of white swans for the Son of Heaven to drink, as it increases one’s dark strength. They also prepared the *dong* of cattle and sheep—*dong* meaning milk, which the people of Jiangnan also call *zhong* (pronounced like *handong*). They washed the Son of Heaven’s feet and the feet of his two charioteers to make their skin smooth.\n\nOn *jiaxu*, *Gounu* of the Minister of Search feasted the Son of Heaven at Fanliu Mountain and presented three hundred horses, five thousand cattle and sheep, a thousand carts of autumn wheat (wheat), and thirty carts of *mo* millet (*mo* meaning millet).\n\nThe term *mo* remains unattested. The Son of Heaven ordered Xiang Yao to receive the tribute. They presented forty blocks of *zhisi* stone, of which the finest were fashioned into one hundred pieces of *yingxunmei*, *guijue*, and *mipei*, along with forty rods of *langya* and ten baskets of *soutang*—it is suspected these were a kind of *ge* fabric. The Son of Heaven ordered Zaofu to receive them.\n\nThereupon, he bestowed upon them two sets of nine silverwood vessels inlaid with variegated colors and gold, forty belts of cowrie shells, three hundred bolts of vermilion silk, and a hundred hills’ worth of cassia and ginger. *Gounu* then prostrated himself in gratitude and received the gifts.\n\nOn *yihai*, the Son of Heaven marched south to the eastern tail of Yangyu—*wei* meaning the rear of the mountain. He then crossed the valley of *Juekan*, arriving at last at the northern bank of the *Jujue* River. There stood the *Gusou* tribes, descendants of the River Lord. Today, the state of *Qusou* lies to the west—it is suspected that *Gu* is a variant of *Qu*. They served the August Son of Heaven at his mountain, where grew the *mojin* tree, the leaves of which were consumed by the illustrious sovereign. *Mojin* is the name of a tree; *hou* means \"lord.\" *Jin* is pronounced like *jin*.\n\nThe Son of Heaven commended them and bestowed upon them a single jade pendant. Boyao prostrated himself twice in gratitude. On *guichou*, the Son of Heaven marched east, and Boyao escorted him to the land of the *Pen* people. The Earl of Pen, Xu, feasted the Son of Heaven upon the shores of Zaoyuan. There, the *Duo* tribes dwelled by the *na*—*na* meaning the water’s edge. The Yellow River flowed southward in a great bend—*huan* means \"to turn back,\" pronounced like *xuan*.\n\nThe Son of Heaven declared: \"For five days, I shall rest upon the shores of Zaoyuan to await the arrival of the Six Armies.\" On *wuwu*, the Son of Heaven marched east, then commanded Boyao to return to the state of *Ziwu*. The Son of Heaven said: \"The House of He is upright.\" Xiang Yao prostrated himself twice in gratitude and took his leave.\n\nThe Son of Heaven turned southward and ascended the *Deng* slope of Changsong, where long pines grew. In the first month of winter, on *renxu*, he arrived at Leishou. Leishou is the name of a mountain, now located south of Xiaoban County in Hedong. The Quanrong Hu feasted the Son of Heaven at the foot of Leishou and presented four teams of six horses. The Son of Heaven ordered Kong Ya to receive them, saying: \"By the level and frigid waters of the Lei River, I possess dogs, horses, sheep, and cattle—among them, black oxen with white horns, and black sheep with white blood.\" This was recorded as a marvel.\n\nOn *guihai*, the Son of Heaven marched south and ascended the *Deng* slope of Zi.\n\nOn the day marked by the sound *Yinzi*.\n\nOn *bingyin*, the Son of Heaven arrived at the slopes of Xingshan, then ascended eastward via the three paths of the *Deng* and lodged at Erbien. He commanded Mao Ban—Mao Ban being an ancestor of the Wei lineage—to hasten ahead to Zhou and await the Son of Heaven’s decree.\n\nOn *guiyou*, the Son of Heaven ordered the harnessing of the Eight Steeds, with the team of Red Colt at the fore. Zaofu served as charioteer as they soared southward, cutting directly across the Di roads. The Di roads lay in Longxi, referring to the crossing at Longji. They ascended Mount Taihang, crossed the Yellow River to the south, and galloped a thousand *li* before entering Zongzhou. The palace attendants presented the blood of a white swan for the Son of Heaven to drink and to wash his feet—this was also called \"milk.\" Zaofu then prepared sheep’s blood to feed the four-horse team, one of which shared the king’s chariot, serving as the right-hand guard. This is what the *Zuo Zhuan* refers to as the \"four-horse team.\"\n\nOn *gengchen*, the Son of Heaven held a grand court at the ancestral temple of Zongzhou and calculated the distances of the western lands. *Li* here means to measure the journey’s length. The *Bamboo Annals* states: \"When King Mu returned from his western campaign, he measured the realm, totaling one hundred and ninety thousand *li*.\" He declared: \"From Zongzhou along the Chan River to the west—the Chan River now lies west of Luoyang, and Luoyang is Chengzhou—up to the lands of Hezong and Mount Yangyu, the distance is three thousand four hundred *li*. From Yangyu west to the lands of the Xixia, two thousand five hundred *li*. From the Xixia to the lands of the Zhuyu and the headwaters of the Yellow River, one thousand five hundred *li*. From the headwaters of the Yellow River west to Mount Xiang, and south to Mount Chong, the Pearl Marsh, and the Kunlun Hills, seven hundred *li*. From Mount Chong west to the lands of the Chiyu, three hundred *li*. Turning northeast to the Mountains of Massed Jade, north of Mount Chong—*jie* meaning 'to pass by'—from the Mountains of Massed Jade west to the lands of the Queen Mother of the West, three thousand *li*. From the lands of the Queen Mother of the West north to the Vast Plains, where birds shed their feathers—this is the so-called 'place of molting'—one thousand nine hundred *li*. From Zongzhou to the great northern Vast Plains—according to the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, there are two marshes where flocks gather, one a hundred *li* square, the other a thousand *li*, which is this Vast Plain—fourteen thousand *li* in all before returning. From there southeast back to Yangyu, seven thousand *li*, and returning to Zhou, three thousand *li*. Each journey combined totals thirty-five thousand *li*.\"\n\nOn the auspicious day *jiashen*, the Son of Heaven offered sacrifices at the ancestral temple of Zongzhou to announce his return. As the *Great Commentary on the Book of Documents* states: \"Upon returning, one must report to the ancestral temple.\" On *yiyou*, the Son of Heaven reviewed the six armies by the Luo River. On *dinghai*, he crossed the Yellow River to the north at the slopes of *Hao* and ascended northwest to the *Deng* of the Nine Rivers at Mengmen. Mengmen Mountain now lies north of the Yellow River. The *Master Shi* states: \"The Yellow River issues from above Mengmen.\" He then proceeded southwest.\n\nIn the second month of winter, on *renchen*, he reached the summit of Xiaoshan and performed the grand music, which concluded after three days. On the auspicious day *dingyou*, the Son of Heaven entered Nanzheng, now Zheng County in Jingzhao. The *Bamboo Annals* records that in the first year of King Mu, the *Zhi* Palace was built in Nanzheng, which is the palace where, as the tradition holds, the king met his end.\n\n*End of Scroll Four of the* Chronicle of King Mu\n*Scroll Five of the* Chronicle of King Mu *begins*\n\nGuo Pu of Jin annotates the ancient text *Treasured Records*, stating: \"The Son of Heaven rested at Huo Marsh for four days—this is present-day Huo Marsh County in Pingyang. The pronunciation of *huo* is *hutè*. There, he shot crows and hunted beasts.\n\nOn *dingshou*, the Son of Heaven [text corrupt] arrived at his destination. Ji Fu, the Earl of Pu, came from Pu Zheng to pay his respects. Zheng had fields called Pu, hence the name Pu Zheng. *Yè* means 'to report.' He presented a hundred pieces of jade from the state of Liukun, as Liukun is recorded in the *Bamboo Annals*. The Rong of Lingdi offered tribute: Lingdi was a state of the Chen clan. The pronunciation of *ling* is *jùn*. They brought a hundred teams of fine horses—*The Tradition* states: 'a hundred teams of patterned horses.' They returned the treasures of Bi, as Bi was a state. This refers to the Di having previously taken these treasures, now seeking reconciliation. *Chéng* means 'peace.' *Gǔ* means 'to demand.'\n\nThe Lord of Jun, Hu [text corrupt] Dongmu—among the Yi and Di, those of virtue are called *zi*. *Chóu* is a Hu name—met the Viscount of Xu at the banks of the Wei River. *Nán* is a rank of nobility. Xu is the present-day Xu Chang County, where the Xiao River flows. The pronunciation of *wěi* is *yǔměi* (reversed).\n\nJi Fu, speaking on the Son of Heaven’s behalf, said: 'Depart from this lamb and present jade and silk.' By ritual, a viscount holds a rush-matted jade disc, but the Viscount of Xu, wishing to display humility, held a lamb instead. The Viscount of Xu dared not refuse and accepted the royal command. He then took eastern silk and added it to the jade, while the Duke of Mao presented ceremonial jade. The Duke of Mao was Mao Ban.\n\nOn that day, the Son of Heaven feasted the Viscount of Xu by the Wei River. The Son of Heaven said: 'Were it not for the state of Xu, I would not have shown such concern for the people [text corrupt].' The Ji clan’s banquets lacked propriety, for ritual dictates that the Son of Heaven address those of different surnames as 'uncle' or 'elder.' Feasts are private gatherings, not intended to elevate ritual propriety. As *The Guanzi* states: 'The uncle does not bow below.' The character is also written as *jiù* (uncle), and *jiù* here means the same. The Viscount of Xu dared not refuse and ascended to sit at the *chūzūn*—*The Rites* states: 'To turn the jade and present the *chūzūn* is only done when two lords are on good terms.' After offering the toast and returning the cup, the *chūzūn* was placed above, akin to this custom. He was seated beside the honored vessel and made the master of the wine, so that the feast might proceed with unbridled joy.\n\nThen they indulged in banquet music, referring to an intimate feast. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon the Viscount of Xu sixteen fine horses—*jùn* denotes renowned steeds. The Viscount of Xu descended and performed the *kōngshǒu* bow, where the head touches the ground. *The Rites of Zhou* states: 'On the third day, the *kōng* bow is performed.' He then ascended to sit in peaceful accord.\n\nAt dusk, the Son of Heaven permitted the Viscount of Xu to return home.\"\n\nOn the *guǐhài* day, the Son of Heaven boarded a black *wū* boat, with the *lóng* guard sailing upon the great marsh. *Zhǎo* means \"pond.\" Below *lóng* is the character for \"boat.\" Boats were all fashioned in the shapes of dragons and crows—today’s *qīngquè fǎng* (green magpie barge) preserves this ancient design.\n\nOn the *gēngwǔ* day of summer, the Son of Heaven feasted by the Wěi River and dispatched *Jìfù* to *Pǔzhèng*, employing the rites for the feudal lords.\n\nOn the *xīnwèi* day, the Son of Heaven returned north, fished at *Jiàn* Marsh, and dined on fish in *Sāngyě*. On the *dīngchǒu* day, the Son of Heaven surveyed the roads of *Lǐpǔ* and *Tián*, measuring and designating the land as a royal preserve, with foresters appointed to guard it. It extended east to *Fáng*—*Fáng* being *Fángzǐ*, a territory of the state of *Zhào*, where *Zuànshān* lay—west to *□qiū*, south to *Sāngyě*, and north to the marshes of *Jīnglín* and *Zhǔ□*. From south to north, it spanned fifty *□* and ten forester stations. The eastern forester was called *Tùtái*, the western *Lìqiū* (*Lì* is now *Yángdí* County in *Hénán*; pronounced *lì*). The southern forester was named *□Fùqiū*, and the northern *Xiāngqíyù*. The foresters were said to be: *□lái* of the ten forester stations.\n\nOn the *□chén* day, the Son of Heaven encamped at *Jūnqiū* to hunt in the marshes of *□*. On the *jiǎyín* day, the Son of Heaven constructed *Jūfàn* Palace—*fàn* being the name of a detached palace—to observe the mulberry harvest. *Sāng* refers to the gathering of mulberry leaves. *The Odes* states: *\"The mulberry gatherers are so lively!\"* He then feasted amid the mulberry groves. The Son of Heaven commanded the *Sāngyú* to oversee the mulberry harvesters, issuing prohibitions against violent men and forbidding reckless damage to the mulberry trees.\n\nOn the *jiǎshēn* day of mid-summer, the Son of Heaven *□*. On the *gēngyín* day, the Son of Heaven journeyed west and lodged at *Jì*. *Jì* was the fief of the *Jì* Duke. On the *rénchén* day, the *Jì* Duke offered wine to the Son of Heaven and sang the ode *\"Facing Heaven.\"* *The Odes and Eulogies* include *\"Vast Heaven has its decree; the two sovereigns received it, and King Cheng dared not rest at ease.\"* It is suspected that the *Jì* Duke used this to admonish the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven then commanded the singing of *\"South Mountain Shines,\"* from *The Lesser Court Hymns*: *\"South Mountain stands so grand; joyful is the noble lord, the foundation of state and home.\"* This was in response to the *Jì* Duke’s words. However, these are all ancient characters, and their precise meaning remains unclear.\n\nThen he continued the banquet and music. *Shào* means \"to continue.\"\n\nOn the *dīngyǒu* day, the Son of Heaven built a terrace as his western residence. On the *rényín* day, the Son of Heaven traveled east to *Quèliáng*. On the *jiǎchén* day, he sailed upon the *Róng* River—now *Róngyáng* and *Róng* Marsh. Then grand music was performed.\n\nIn the last month of summer, on the *gēng*□ day, he rested at *Fàn* Palace. In the second month of autumn, on the *dīngsì* day, the Son of Heaven hunted deer in the forest, then feasted at the *Mèng* clan’s estate, where sixteen white cranes danced in time. Today, domesticated cranes and peacocks can also dance to the rhythm of drums.\n\nHe returned to lodge at *Quèliáng*. In the last month of autumn, on the *xīnsì* day, the Son of Heaven inspected the troops at □*lái*, with the foresters serving as secondary attendants, standing by in order to answer any questions.\n\nIn the first month of winter, the crows arrived, crying as they soared. The royal ministers □*yì*. The text below states that the royal ministers were the *Jī*-clan lords, surnamed *Nǚ*—likely referring to the women’s palace officials.\n\nIn the second month of winter, on the *dīngyǒu* day, the Son of Heaven hunted beasts and rested at *Shēnqú*. *Qú* is a medicine of *wéi*. He obtained 420 elk, boars, and deer, along with two tigers and nine wolves, then offered them in sacrifice to the former kings, commanding the royal cooks to prepare them. The *páorén* were those in charge of food and drink.\n\nOn the *wùxū* day, the Son of Heaven traveled west and hunted at *Zhōng*□, where the plants and trees were lush and verdant. He ordered the foresters to clear the woods and marshes to provide timber for the people. *Luě* means \"to fell and cut.\" On that day, the Son of Heaven entered *Yóu* to the north—*Yóu* being a town of *Zhèng*, pronounced *bǐng*. There, he played *bó* with the *Jǐng* Duke for three days before deciding the outcome.\n\nThe King suspected that the *Jǐng* Duke was a worthy man who concealed his talents, so King Mu sought him out for leisure and play.\n\nOn the *xīnchǒu* day, the roads were blocked—though not as before, this was an advance blockade. Arriving at the terrace, the great heat was dispelled. The Son of Heaven resided at the terrace to hear the affairs of the realm and escape the summer heat. From distant lands, the tally of those who followed was vast.\n\nThus, he selected the finest musicians and recorded their divine skills—these were the arts of the Dao. Gazing left and right, he observed the omens. The Son of Heaven delighted in this, cherishing their arts. He commanded that [the musicians] be appointed to [official posts] and attend to their duties at set times, naming them... The *Gōng* departed, and the charioteers... There was a tiger in the reeds, where the reeds were sparse. As the Son of Heaven was about to arrive, the *Qīcuì* warriors, led by Gāo Bēnróng, requested to capture the tiger alive, ensuring its safety. They then captured the tiger alive and presented it. This is what the *Odes* refers to: *\"Bare-chested, clad in coarse cloth, they wrestle tigers, presenting them at the lord’s court.\"* Such was the deed.\n\nThe Son of Heaven ordered it to be caged—*\"xiá\"* being the term for a wooden pen. As the *Analects* says: *\"When tigers and rhinos escape their pens,\"* and so he kept it in the eastern forest, which became known as *Hǔláo* (\"Tiger Enclosure\"), thus naming the place. Today, this is *Xiánchē* County in *Róngyáng*.\n\nThe Son of Heaven bestowed upon Bēnróng ten teams of four hunting horses—*The Erya* states: *\"In the hunt, the horses’ hooves move as one, prizing swiftness.\"* He also granted him a grand sacrificial feast, consisting of an ox, a sheep, and a pig. Bēnróng bowed twice, knocking his forehead to the ground.\n\nOn the *bǐngchén* day, the Son of Heaven journeyed north into the forest, where he received a great mandate before returning. In the mid-autumn *jiǎxū* month, he traveled east, halting at Quèliáng. One night was called a *\"shè\"* (lodging), two nights a *\"xìn\"* (trust), and beyond that, a *\"cì\"* (sojourn). [A scribe] recorded the *dùshū* in the Feathered Forest—*dù* referred to the bookworms that infested the texts, hence the name *Dùshū* (\"Moth-Eaten Records\").\n\nIn the late autumn [month], he lodged at Fǎng, where the Bì people reported a threat: the Fǎng Dí had invaded. The Son of Heaven dispatched Mèng Niàn to Bì to suppress the Róng—*Niàn* is pronounced like *yù*. The Marquis of Huò had earlier reported his death. The state of Huò now lies southwest of Yǒng’ān County in Píngyáng, where its city walls remain.\n\nThe Son of Heaven ascended Jūnqiū, hunting in the marshes. On the *jiǎxū* day of late winter, he traveled east, feasted at Liúqí, shot at Lìhǔ, and read in Púqiū. *\"When a lord acts, it is recorded.\"* *Lì* is pronounced like *lí*.\n\n[A chieftain] presented wine to the Son of Heaven, who then commanded the performance of grand music. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon him the sacred drum, which transformed into a yellow serpent. *The Rites of Zhou* states: *\"The sacred drum has four faces.\"* *The Great Plan* calls this a *\"drum omen.\"* That day, the Son of Heaven drummed upon the ground beneath it and cried out, striking the drum after losing its original—*\"drumming on the ground\"* refers to the path of the crow. Hán Fēi said: *\"The Dao comes from the south.\"* He then planted a paulownia, for the paulownia is a resonant wood. When made into a drum, it would resound with divine power, proving advantageous in warfare and suitable for attacking the Róng. When made into a zither, it would also be propitious.\n\nHe traveled to Huángzé, journeying east to lodge at Qūluò—a bend in the Luò River, the name of the place. He dismissed [his attendants], ordering the palace musicians to sing. The musicians, keepers of the court’s music, chanted:\n*\"By the Yellow Pool,\nthe horses drink sand.\"*\n*\"Drink\"* means to tread. The pronunciation is *qiè*.\n*\"The august ones display their majesty.\"*\n*\"Majesty\"* means grandeur.\n*\"By the Yellow Marsh,\nthe horses drink jade.\"*\nAll were satirical verses.\n*\"The august one receives the grain.\"*\n*\"Grain\"* means life.\n\nOn the *bǐngchén* day, the Son of Heaven traveled south to the mound of Huáng[shì]shì, to observe the former dwelling of Xià Hòu Qǐ. This likely refers to the mound of Tàishì, Mount Sōnggāo. Qǐ’s mother was transformed into stone on this mountain, and Qǐ himself ascended as an immortal, leaving behind a chamber above, as recorded in *The Returning to the Obscure* and *The Master of Huáinán*. He then entered Qǐ’s chamber, where the Son of Heaven divined about hunting in Huázé. The hexagram obtained was *Sòng* (Conflict)—Kǎn below, Qián above.\n\nFéng Gōng interpreted it, saying: *\"The line text of Sòng states: ‘The marshes are vast and dark; within them, [a struggle arises]. It is fitting for the true lord. In matters of war, follow the Way. Water is level by nature, and Heaven is impartial. If one does not bend or yield, military affairs will succeed. For sacrifices, there will be joy; for the hunt, there will be gain.\"*\n\n[The Son of Heaven] feasted Féng Gōng with wine and bestowed upon him sixteen fine horses and thirty baskets of *xiānfēn*—*xiān* being the finest hemp. Féng Gōng bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and was granted the title of Diviner-Historian.\n\nA fox [howled] amid dark rain, and the Son of Heaven dreamed of spirits engaged in affairs—*\"affairs\"* meaning sacrifice. This was called *\"double yin,\"* and thus it was recorded.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then rested. At noon, a great cold descended, and a north wind brought rain and snow, freezing the people. The Son of Heaven composed three verses of poetry to lament the people’s suffering—*\"lament\"* meaning to pity. He said:\n*\"My ancestor at Yellow Bamboo,\n[the land] wide and bitterly cold.\nThe Emperor gathers the Nine Ways—\n‘Ways’ mean paths,\nspeaking of encompassing the roads of the Nine Regions.\nAs *The Zuǒ Tradition* says: ‘The Nine Roads were opened.’\nAlas, my lords and marquises,\nthe hundred rulers and chief ministers—\n‘Rulers’ mean lords; ‘chief ministers’ mean the grand stewards.\nCorrect our ten thousand people,\n‘Correct’ means to set aright.\ndo not forget them day or night.\nEver remember them.\"*\n\nMy ancestor at Yellow Bamboo,\n[the land] vast and bitterly cold.\nThe Emperor gathers the Nine Ways—\nAlas, my lords and marquises,\nthe hundred rulers and chief ministers,\nset aright our ten thousand people,\nday and night do not exhaust them.\nLet none be distressed.\n\nThere is a bright-feathered *luo*—\n*Luo* is the name of a bird.\n*Jiao* means \"white fledgling.\"\nIts cry sounds like *lu*.\nGracefully it soars in flight,\nspeaking of its contentment.\nAlas, my lords and marquises,\ndo not follow the [wrong] model.\n\nFrom the marquises downward,\nit should read: \"the hundred rulers and chief ministers,\nset aright our ten thousand people,\ndo not follow the [wrong] model.\"\nDwelling in joy is scant;\nto guard one place brings little happiness—\nbetter to roam the land without seeking ease,\ngoverning the people with ritual and music.\nThis means to transform them through ritual and music.\n\nThe Son of Heaven said: \"I alone am excessive—\nexcessive in wandering and pleasure.\nI do not set aright the ten thousand people.\"\n...\nHe then lodged at Yellow Bamboo.\n\nThe Son of Heaven dreamed of Yi shooting at Mount Tu.\nYi was the lord of the Youqiong clan, a skilled archer.\nMinister Ji interpreted the dream, [recording] its omens.\nHe then lodged at Qu Mountain.\n\nOn the *renshen* day, the Son of Heaven ascended Qu Mountain’s western heights.\n...\nWhen the Son of Heaven marched west,\nhe ascended the Nine Mounds—\nlikely the Nine Mounds of modern Xi’an County.\nHe lodged south at Crimson Yellow.\n\nOn the *wuyin* day, the Son of Heaven ascended Yang...\npassing by the well of Lord Bo of Ling...\nWhenever King Mu journeyed forth and back, he always traveled with Lord Bo of the Well,\nshowing he was a man of virtue and power.\nHe then harnessed deer to roam the mountain,\nerecting a stone marker and filling it with dried provisions.\nThis was the Ganshi Mound.\nNow [it lies] in Dayang County, Hedong.\n\nThe *Tradition* states: He entered Kuailing. *Kuai* is pronounced in two ways: *diān* and *lǐng*. He then encamped on the northern bank of the Huan River. This is today’s Huán Ford, located in Heyang County north of the Yellow River. *Huán* is pronounced like the *dòu* in *xiàngdòu*. On the auspicious day *dīnghài*, the Son of Heaven entered Southern Zheng.\n\n*Scroll Five of the* Transmission of King Mu *ends here.*\n*Scroll Six of the* Transmission of King Mu.\nWith annotations by Guo Pu of Jin. In the ancient script:\n\n...the desolate ruins, the emperor’s renown. Thereupon [he] ascended the Nine Observances with the Former Master to instruct later generations. This was again an ascent of a famous mountain, where inscriptions were carved and enfeoffments established. Many characters are missing and cannot be reconstructed.\n\nOn the *jǐsì* day, the Son of Heaven marched forth and lodged at Zhi Terrace. On the *xīnwèi* day, he hunted the beasts of Niuzhi. The *Guanzi* states: *Zhi* refers to the soil of vegetable fields. Today, the people of Wu call hunting grounds overgrown with grass *zhi*. Thereupon, a white deer suddenly burst free and fled. This means it broke through the encirclement. *Wù* means to strike the ground. Some say the deer he had harnessed was still present, yet startled. The Son of Heaven mounted the chariot drawn by Quhuang steeds.\n\nFrom here onward, the text likely describes the pursuit and capture of the deer. The Son of Heaven named it, *qiū* being a designation in the local dialect. This was called the Office of the Five Deer, and the place was named Qiukou. He flayed its hide, calling it *Qiupi*; he dried its meat, calling it *Qiupu*. The Son of Heaven drank by the waters of the Ta River. The Ta River is today’s Ta County in Jiyin. *Tà* is pronounced *yǎo*. The officials prepared venison and offered it to the Son of Heaven, who found it delicious, calling it *Gan*. From this point onward, all places were named after the deer to commemorate the event. Today, in the eastern outskirts of Yuancheng County, there is a Five Deer Ruin, where Duke Wen of Jin begged for food from a peasant.\n\nOn the *guǐyǒu* day, the Son of Heaven sacrificed a white deer to the south at the Ta Ford, then drank to the west in the midst of the wild grass. A grand performance of music was held, *grand* meaning a magnificent display. This was called the Musician’s Place, also recorded to mark the occasion.\n\nOn the *jiǎxū* day, the Son of Heaven traveled northwest to the Ji clan, the daughter of Sheng Wu. *Sheng* was the name of a state. The preceding passage likely concerns the Ji matter. The *Gongyang Commentary* states: What is *Cheng*? *Sheng* is used to avoid taboo, for *Sheng* and *Qi* are homophonous, and those of the same surname [must avoid such names]. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon her the leadership of the Upper Ji, for Sheng Wu was the chief of the Ji clan, holding the highest rank. This was called Sheng Gate. The Son of Heaven then built a terrace for her, constructing a terrace for Sheng Ji. This was called the Terrace of Layered Jade, for the terrace resembled stacked jade discs.\n\nOn the *wùyín* day, the Son of Heaven hunted eastward in the marsh and encountered a cold illness. This means Sheng Ji contracted a chill from the wind there. The Son of Heaven lodged in the marsh, and Sheng Ji fell ill. The Son of Heaven pitied her and named the marsh *Han* Marsh after her. Sheng Ji requested a drink, and the Son of Heaven ordered someone to fetch broth swiftly. The *Tradition* asks: How swiftly it was obtained! This was called Hulun. *Hu* is the name of a vessel; *lun*, pronounced *yí*, means swift, akin to *sù*.\n\nThe Son of Heaven traveled west to the Terrace of Layered Jade, where Sheng Ji’s illness worsened. The Son of Heaven mourned her; the preceding passage likely describes Sheng Ji’s death. This was called the Mourning Station, the place where he wept. The Son of Heaven then interred Sheng Ji in the ancestral temple of Guqiu. There were ancestral temples of former kings here. The Han dynasty also had temples in such places.\n\nOn the *rényín* day, the Son of Heaven commanded mourning, ordering the ministers to attend the grand lamentation. Qi served as the principal mourner, acting as the master of the funeral rites. The preceding *Qi* likely refers to opening the coffin. He sacrificed to Father Bin, who assisted with the funeral rites. The Son of Heaven’s daughter, Shu Zhi, served as the principal mourner. *Shu* was her clan name; she was King Mu’s daughter. *Càn* is pronounced like *zuò*. The Son of Heaven ordered the completion of the mourning rites for the guests, commanding that the funeral rites be carried out to their conclusion. Thereupon, they performed the *shang* sacrifice and wept. *Shang* refers to an incomplete mourning, for Sheng Ji was young.\n\nThe Grand Scribe held the bamboo slips to record the posthumous gifts. The Grand Scribe was responsible for decrees. The officials arranged the mats and set up the armrests, *fū* meaning to spread. The *Rites of Zhou* states: In mourning affairs, follow the general rules. The sacrificial preparations were made, *jì* referring to the offerings. The lung stew and meat were pronounced accordingly. *Zài* refers to the dried meat of large game, *zǎo* to jujube wine, and *xù* to clear gruel, pronounced *yí*. *Yùn* refers to meat sauce, *yú là* to dried fish, *mó hán* to cold gruel, and *jiǔ* to leeks, pronounced *yì*. All things were prepared, indicating completeness.\n\nThe raw offerings were arranged on twelve stands, ninety dried dishes were presented, and forty tripods, *dūn* vessels, *hú* jars, and *zūn* goblets were set out. *Dūn* resembles a tray, pronounced *duī*. The vessels were miscellaneous utensils. The *zēng* and *zhù* officials performed the sacrificial feast. Though it was a funeral sacrifice, they still offered food, showing precedence.\n\nThe lung was presented, and the libation wine was poured, using the lung to exchange for salt and sprinkling it in the middle as an offering, called the *zhèn* sacrifice. The rite involved presenting the lung to the *shaolao* sacrificial animal. They then offered the sacrifice to the funeral master Yi Xu, who bowed and received it. The female officiant then offered it to the female principal mourner, Shu Zhi, who bowed and received it. The *zhù* official reported the completion of the sacrifice to the Grand Master, the music official.\n\nThey then wept in their positions, taking their places for the mourning rites. After the weeping concluded, the Grand Scribe read the bamboo slips and wept. *Cè* here should be read as *dú*; in the *Rites for the Evening*, it states: The master’s scribe reads the eulogy. The *zēng* and *zhù* officials held the offerings and wept, *pěng* meaning to hold with both hands. The charioteers prayed and wept. The etiquette for attendants states: The charioteers enter to bathe. The *kàng* officials raised the libation cups and wept at dusk, *kàng* meaning to lift. The *Liji* states: Four minor officials lift the *niǎo*. The *zuǒ* officials held the *dǒu* ladles and wept, for they were the assistants in charge of the funeral. *Dǒu* refers to the water-dipping ladle. The *zuǒ* officials assisted with food and drink. The mourners wore robes and sashes with pendants and wept. The musicians arranged zithers, se harps, *yú* pipes—*yú* here should be *shēng*, for the *shēng* is a type of *yú*—and *yuè* flutes, which resemble three-holed flutes. These were the instruments blown by the officers. The *guǎn* pipes resembled two flutes joined together, pronounced *guǎn*.\n\nThe mourners wept, and the various officials and attendants each performed their duties in weeping. \"The hundred multitudes\" refers to the various clans. It is said: \"Men and women leap in alternation, and after nine leaps, it concludes.\" *Cuò* means \"alternating.\" They leapt thrice with each bout of weeping, three bouts of weeping with nine leaps—this is what is called \"completing the leaps.\" The chief mourner, Yi Xu, wept as he exited to the temporary shelter, the mourning hut. His father’s brothers, the clan elders, and those in office followed him. The assistants wept, for they were the attendants in charge of the funeral. They then removed the sacrificial silks, jars, tripods, stands, and ritual vessels—all tasks overseen by the assistants. The various attendants each performed their duties, all weeping as they departed. The tasks were complete.\n\nJing Li exited last to gather the items. The reason Jing Li alone exited last was to oversee the funeral vessels and ritual objects and put them away. Some say Jing Li was negligent and dilatory, failing to keep pace with the others, and thus was bound and detained.\n\nOn *guǐmǎo*, there was a great weeping, and the funeral procession for the young lady commenced. *Zài* refers to the ancestral departure. On *jiǎchén*, the Son of Heaven buried Lady Sheng in the south of Le Chi—this is the Black Pool. The Son of Heaven then commanded that the funeral of Lady Sheng be modeled after the burial rites of the queen, *shì* meaning \"to compare.\" It was also not to be on par with the queen’s burial among the feudal lords. The character here is likely erroneous; its meaning remains unclear.\n\nThe supply and provisioning between the Yellow and Ji Rivers were jointly managed. The warriors of the three states—Wei Valley, Huang City, and the third—attended the mourning, their biers drawn by man-powered transport carts. The masses of the three states were mobilized to display grandeur and extravagance.\n\nThe Seven Elite warriors lifted the coffin onto the hearse, raising it to mount the vehicle. The *zeng*-priest led the funeral procession as the guide. The Grand Artisan drove the coffin-cart, serving as its charioteer. As the *Zhou Rituals* states: \"The mourning *zhu*-priest acts as the charioteer.\" The *Records of Ritual* says: \"The feudal lords’ coffins are escorted with feathered guards,\" referring to those who precede the procession to regulate its pace.\n\nBanners bore the sun and moon, and the pattern of the Seven Stars—the Northern Dipper—was emblazoned on the *yu*-flags. As the *Records of Ritual* states: \"The sun and moon are depicted on the banners,\" a term also used generally for standards. Drums and bells accompanied the burial.\n\nDragon banners were arrayed alongside, ravens adorned the battle drums, and beasts embellished the bells. Dragons adorned the flags. The order of the funeral procession, the sequence of wailing and leaping, and all matters concerning the bells, banners, and the hundred funeral implements were overseen by Jing Li, arranged in the mourning ranks without the slightest omission.\n\nThe ranks were organized in formation. Drums sounded to advance the funeral procession, while banners were raised to encourage the mourners to fully express their grief. Bells were struck to halt the wailing, and banners were lowered to regulate the rhythm—this refers to the modulation of sound. The banners were lowered, meaning they were dipped.\n\nOn the day of the *xī*-sacrifice, a great wailing was held nine times to conclude the mourning rites. Upon exiting the gate, the chief mourner took his position to assume the place of wailing. The royal house’s fathers, elder brothers, sons, and grandsons formed double ranks—*bei* meaning to arrange in twofold rows. The feudal lords’ affiliated sons and the clan’s affiliated sons clung to the coffin. The royal officials formed double ranks, while the external officials and the royal retinue of the Seven Elite warriors also doubled their ranks. The external officials were those whose duties lay outside the court.\n\nThe Ji-clan descendants doubled their ranks, being Lady Sheng’s kin. Those holding office doubled their ranks—*zhizhi* meaning those performing duties. The assembled officials and commoners doubled their ranks, and the wailers formed sevenfold ranks, arranged in seven layers. The leapers formed thirty rows, each row consisting of a hundred men—a hundred men made one *bei*. *Cui* means \"to gather.\"\n\nThe female chief mourner took her position, with the *bi*-women and the grass-women doubling their ranks. The *bi*-women were those favored and beloved by the king. The king’s ministers’ Ji-clan daughters doubled their ranks—likely referring to women of the same clan who were wives of high officials and officers, known as the inner clan. The palace women doubled their ranks, as palace officials were internal. The palace’s worthy concubines and common concubines doubled their ranks. The common concubines were the numerous scattered concubines. The wailers formed fivefold ranks, and the leapers followed in order.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven issued the command for mourning, the bells would sound for one *li*, and the wailing would cease. It was said that ministers and officials wailed atop their carriages, so the hearse bearing the coffin could not descend. The *zeng*-priests wailed before the funeral procession, while the sevenfold ranks of warriors wailed at the mourning site.\n\nFor minor wailing, leaping was interspersed—three leaps were taken with each step, and after five *li*, they would halt. *Ci* (halt) means to stop. The funeral procession advanced three *she* until reaching the mourning station, then five *she* until arriving at the Terrace of Double Jade. One *she* equaled thirty *li*. As the *Commentary* states: \"To yield to the lord, one retreats three *she*.\" Then they rested. *Xiu* (rest) means to halt.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then encircled the hearse with diverted water, channeling it to flow around it. *Xian* is pronounced *yao*; *yuan* is pronounced *yuan*. On this day, the hearse was sketched, marking the water’s course. It was said that the *shang*-sacrifice was performed here—a repeated offering.\n\nOn the *xinhai* day of the first month of winter, the Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao came to offer condolences. The state of Cao is today’s Dingtao County in Jiyin. The Inner Scribe led them to an audience with the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven, citing indisposition, declined to receive them.\n\nThe indisposition was an expression of illness. As the *Book of Documents* states: \"King Wu was indisposed.\" The Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao then offered condolences to the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince wept as he emerged from the temple gate to welcome the Marquis of Xing, but the Marquis of Cao did not advance. The Crown Prince bowed twice to express gratitude—an inquiry of consolation. The marquises did not return the bow, humbly declining to stand on equal ritual footing with the Crown Prince.\n\nThe Marquis of Xing announced his mourning at the temple. *Ye* means to notify. The Crown Prince wept first before entering, then took his position facing west. The Inner Scribe, acting as the host for the marquises, stood facing north. They wailed loudly nine times. The Marquis of Xing performed three sets of leaping and stamping before ceasing. He and the Crown Prince exchanged ritual gestures. The Crown Prince escorted the Marquis of Xing beyond the temple gate, whereupon the marquis departed. The Crown Prince bowed twice in farewell.\n\nThe Marquis of Cao entered the temple to offer condolences and weep, and the Crown Prince saw him off with the same rites as for the Marquis of Xing. Though the occasions of mourning differed, the ritual was identical.\n\nOn the *renzi* day, the Son of Heaven, with all officials in attendance, received the Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao. *Ju guan* means to prepare the full rites for an audience. The Son of Heaven then turned back, preparing to return. The Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao performed the *zhi jian* bow to the Son of Heaven’s martial retinue—a gesture of obscure significance. The Son of Heaven received them and then dispatched the Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao back to their states. The royal officials continued to observe proper ritual in their interactions with the two marquises, demonstrating that mourning did not suspend propriety.\n\nIt was said that the Son of Heaven issued decrees—*xian* commands—with some enforcing flogging as punishment. The above describes the matters of conferring posthumous honors. Clothing and goods were called *ta*. Pronounced *sui*.\n\nOn the *guichou* day, there was a great wailing and [text missing]. On the *jiayin* day, the *shang*-sacrifice was performed again, followed by great wailing and the procession’s departure. The funeral cortege halted five *she* at the grand encampment. It was said that the mourning lasted three days at the grand encampment—a three-day pause. The *shang*-sacrifice was conducted as before.\n\nOn the *xinyou* day, the *da cheng* was completed, with all items prepared. All objects for the funeral procession were ready. On the *renxu* day, the burial officers recorded the hanging of bells and drums as the coffin was lowered. *Yi* means \"to descend.\" The elite guards of the Seven Armies [text missing] men and women performed nine sets of leaping and stamping [text missing] as the funeral cortege descended.\n\nAt the artisans' entry into the upper chamber, dawn had not yet broken. The Son of Heaven dispatched the jade-workers to those he cherished. For the posthumous gifts, nine sets of patterned brocade and luminous robes were used—these were called \"luminous robes,\" garments of the radiant spirit. The funeral director Yi Hu presented altered skirts, for the director also presided. \"Altered skirts\" was the name of the garment. The female director Shu Cuo offered brocade mattresses and woven sashes—mat and cushion. All the jade-workers and their officers completed the gifts, referring to the painted and embroidered offerings. \"Officers\" was the title for military men. As the *Liji* states: \"Officers share one ancestral temple.\" Jing Li then interred them. The interment took place at the tomb site, and the cortege returned to wail at the grand encampment—\"returned\" meaning to go back. The grand encampment was the divine resting place of the spirit. Xiang Ke [text missing] performed the funeral rites, ceasing the wailing and bidding farewell to distant mourners, dismissing them with gratitude.\n\nFor Sheng Ji, her posthumous title was \"One Morning’s Virtuous Lady.\" A reverent person cut short in life was called \"mournful.\" The Son of Heaven ordered the grave-diggers to name the mound \"Mound of the Virtuous Lady.\" On the *yichou* day, the Son of Heaven marched eastward, halting at Wu Lu. The Shu clan mourned and wept, grieving for Sheng Ji. That day was named \"Mound of the Weeping Woman,\" and thus Wu Lu was so called. On the *dingmao* day, the Son of Heaven marched eastward, fishing at the Luo River to sacrifice to the Virtuous Lady—this day was the \"Sacrificial Mound.\" On the *jisi* day, the Son of Heaven continued eastward, feeding his horses by the Luo River, then striking the thornwood drum—this day was the \"Horse Master.\" The significance remains unclear.\n\nOn the *dayou* day, the Son of Heaven marched southward, arriving at Zhi Terrace. In midwinter, on the *jiaxu* day, the Son of Heaven marched westward, reaching the land of the Yin clan—a state’s name. There, he fished in the Yellow River to observe the Gu Xian trees. Gu Xian referred to great trees. The *Shanhaijing* states: \"The Xun tree stretches a thousand *li*, growing by the sea.\" This was likely the same type of tree. On the *dingsi* day, the Son of Heaven marched northward. On the *wuyin* day, he encamped by the river and summoned his uncles, elder and younger brothers, sons, and royal ministers—Ji [text missing]—to complete the sacrificial rites and final wailing. As mentioned earlier, the royal ministers were women of the Ji clan; this likely refers to the same. The mourning concluded at the land of the Gao clan, and the period of mourning ended.\n\nOn the *jimao* day, the Son of Heaven crossed the Yellow River westward at the Gao clan’s ford. On the *gengchen* day, he encamped at Mao Chi—a place name. There, he performed the village sacrifice to mark the end of mourning, beginning the music anew. He wore plain robes on his return, his grief not yet forgotten. That day was named \"Plain Clan.\" The Son of Heaven then journeyed southwest. On the *kuiwei* day, he arrived at Ye Wang—present-day Henan County. On the *jiashen* day, the Son of Heaven ascended the great northern peak—likely Mount Taihang—and descended to rest beneath the Twin Bridges, where two bridges stood.\n\nThe Son of Heaven was gripped by eternal sorrow, his heart aching as he thought of the virtuous Lady Sheng Ji, and so his tears flowed. The Seven Guardians’ warrior, Po Yu, remonstrated with the Son of Heaven, saying: “Since ancient times, there has been death and there has been life—how could Lady Sheng alone be thus?” The Son of Heaven remained inconsolable, his grief boundless in endless remembrance. “Endless remembrance is of benefit, yet do not forget what is new.” These words meant that while remembrance is of benefit, one should not forget to seek new companions. The Son of Heaven, overcome with sorrow, wept once more. Upon hearing these words, he recalled how Lady Sheng had once been. That day was named “Cessation.”\n\nOn the *jiwei* day, and again on the *yiyou* day, the Son of Heaven crossed westward over the Xing Peak, ascending the slopes of Mount Yan. It is said that on the *guisi* day, he roamed Mount Jing Yan—*guisi* being an auspicious day. He then continued southwest. On the *wuzi* day, he arrived at Fu. He traversed the Pei Pool, now located in Jie County of Hedong. The character for “salt” here is pronounced *gu*. On the *jichou* day, the Son of Heaven ascended the southern heights of Mount Bo, specifically the Gan Peak—now the site of Gan Bridge to the southwest, a perilous place where two paths run through the center. He then lodged in Yu. Yu was the name of a state, now Taiyang County.\n\nOn the *gengshen* day, the Son of Heaven marched south. On the auspicious *xinmao* day, he entered Southern Zheng. Thus concludes Scroll Six of *The Chronicle of King Mu*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Mu Tianzi Zhuan**\n\n**Title:** *The Mu Tianzi Zhuan* (*The Chronicle of King Mu of Zhou*). Six juan. Attributed to Guo Pu of the Jin with annotations. Base text from *Zhengtong Daozang* (*Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*), *Dongzhen* section, *Jizhuan* category. Collated with the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\n**Preface to the Mu Tianzi Zhuan**\n\n*The Mu Tianzi Zhuan* was unearthed from the tomb at Ji, and Jin scholar Xun Xu collated and edited it into six juan. It includes a preface stating that though its events are not canonical, its language is profoundly ancient and well worth perusal.\n\nIn his own preface, Zimei (Xun Xu) notes that King Mu reigned for a hundred years, and in his dotage, the Grand Historian’s record of his audience with the Queen Mother of the West aligns with many transmitted accounts. Thus, this text likely preserves the full details of that era and cannot be dismissed outright.\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, each feudal lord maintained their own state annals, often filled with convoluted narratives. By the Warring States era, royal authority waned and sagely teachings faded, while recluses advanced heterodox theories, each household espousing its own doctrines. How could such accounts not be convoluted?\n\nThe text records the king’s travels with his Seven Elite Guards, yet his retinue was modest, and his demands upon the realm were few. Unlike the Qin and Han emperors, who mobilized thousands of chariots and emptied the state for their expeditions, King Mu’s self-reckoning of his faults and the admonitions of his guards suggest no such excess. When he ascended Mount Yu to quarry jade, he ordered the Marquis of Xing to oversee the work but refused tribute, adhering to the former kings’ principle of relieving the people’s burdens. When rain and snow fell, he allowed his men to rest, while his Eight Steeds galloped ahead to await him. Only after ten days did he resume his journey—no harsh commands or rigid deadlines were imposed.\n\nFollowing the prosperous reigns of Cheng and Kang, the people lived in peace. Even the virtuous efforts of King Xu Yan, who practiced benevolence and righteousness, failed to sway the realm. This demonstrates that no tyranny or oppressive governance prevailed. Yet the gentleman still considers King Mu’s death in the ancestral temple a great fortune, revealing how precarious the hearts of men truly are. How could such a path be emulated? How could it be emulated?\n\nThose who preserve this text may admire its antiquity, while those who examine its events must carefully weigh its truths and falsehoods.\n\nThis book was once in the collection of Liu Zhenting of Haidai, Attendant of the Southern Terrace. Fearing its loss, he took leisure to collate and correct its errors, then commissioned the Jinling Academy to reprint it, sharing it with scholars of broad learning. I inscribe this at the beginning of the volume.\n\nWritten on the twenty-seventh day of the second lunar month in the *gengyin* year of the Zhizheng reign (1350), by Wang Jianxuan of Northern Yue.\n\n**Preface to the Mu Tianzi Zhuan**\nBy Minister of the Imperial Secretariat, Supervisor of the Palace Writers, and Marquis of Jibei, Xun Xu\n\n**Preface:**\nThe ancient text *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* was discovered in the second year of the Taikang era (281 CE), when Bu Zhun, a resident of Ji County, looted an ancient tomb. The text was written on bamboo slips bound with white silk. According to the ancient measurements I previously established, each slip was two *chi* and four *cun* long, inscribed in ink with forty characters per slip.\n\nJi was part of Wei during the Warring States period. Based on the *Annals* found there, this tomb likely belonged to King Ling of Wei, the son of King Hui of Wei, corresponding to King Xiang in the *Generational Records*. According to the *Records of the Grand Historian: Chronological Table of the Six States*, from the twenty-first year of King Ling’s reign to the thirty-fourth year of the First Emperor of Qin (when books were burned), spans eighty-six years. From then to the second year of the Taikang era, when this text was first recovered, totals five hundred and seventy-nine years.\n\nThe text recounts the travels of King Mu of Zhou. The *Zuo Zhuan* states: \"King Mu wished to indulge his desires, journeying throughout the realm, ensuring all had chariots and horses at their disposal.\" This text records those very events.\n\nThe king loved his tours of inspection. He obtained the steeds Daoli and Lü’er, with Zaofu as his charioteer, to explore the four wildernesses. He crossed the Flowing Sands to the north, ascended Kunlun to the west, and met the Queen Mother of the West—events corroborated by the Grand Historian’s records.\n\nThe Ji commandery’s handling of the recovered texts was careless, resulting in much damage and loss. Though its accounts are not canonical, they are ancient writings and certainly worth perusal.",

Xing Mountain is now located in Shiyi County of Changshan. *Xing* is pronounced like *Xing*.\n\nOn the *gui-wei* day, snow fell, and the Son of Heaven hunted on the western slope of Xing Mountain—a slope of the mountain. There, he encountered the sheer cliffs of Jueping Mountain, where *ping* refers to perilous paths within the valley. Pronounced *sui*.\n\nHe then followed the northern bank of the Hutuo River. The Hutuo River is now north of the Yangshui in Lucheng County of Tengmen. *Tuo* is the second character of *tuotuo* (camel), meaning \"to abandon.\"\n\nOn the *yi-you* day, the Son of Heaven ascended □ to the north and marched against the Quanrong. The *Discourses of the States* states: \"King Mu was about to campaign against the Quanrong. After the sacrifice, Gong Moufu admonished him, but he did not heed the advice and proceeded with the expedition. He captured four white wolves and four white deer and returned. From then on, the distant vassals ceased their tribute.\" The *Bamboo Annals* further records: \"He took their five kings eastward.\"\n\nThe Quanrong □ Hu offered wine to the Son of Heaven on the northern bank of the Dang River. The Son of Heaven rejoiced and □ rewarded the warriors of the Seven Elite Troops. *Cui* means \"to assemble\" or \"to gather,\" akin to the *Records* mentioning \"chariot grandees\"—all referring to those of wisdom and strength gathered as the king’s claws and fangs.\n\nOn the *geng-yin* day, a north wind brought snow and sleet. As the *Book of Songs* says: \"The north wind is freezing, the snow falls in flurries.\" Due to the cold, the Son of Heaven ordered the royal retinue to rest. He commanded the king’s followers to take respite.\n\nOn the *jia-wu* day, the Son of Heaven marched west and crossed the pass of Yu. *Deng* means \"slope.\" It is suspected that *bei* refers to the northern ridge, and *xi* to the western peril, which belongs to Menshan. Pronounced *yu*.\n\nOn the *ji-hai* day, he reached Yanju and Yuzhi’s plains—both likely state names.\n\nOn the *xin-chou* day, the Son of Heaven marched west to the state of Lin. *Lin* is a state name, pronounced *po* with a falling tone.\n\nThe descendants of the Hezong, named Lin Xiangxu (Bojue was Xu’s title; the character *bo* was often written with the wood radical in ancient times), came to welcome the Son of Heaven at the □ of Zhi. They presented ten leopard skins and twelve fine horses. In ancient times, rituals always began with offerings, as the *Records* say: \"First, present the four tanned hides.\" The Son of Heaven sent Jing Li to receive them. Jing Li was one of King Mu’s favored ministers.\n\nOn the *gui-you* day, the Son of Heaven lodged at Qishi, staying one night before fishing west of the river to observe □ of Zhi’s □.\n\nOn the *jia-chen* day, the Son of Heaven hunted at Shen Marsh, where he obtained a white fox and a black-striped beast, which he used to sacrifice to the Hezong. This was in preparation for the river rites, and the unusual catch was thus employed. Emperor Wu of Han, during his suburban sacrifices, once obtained a one-horned white deer, which he deemed an auspicious omen and used in the *liao* sacrifice.\n\nOn the *bing-wu* day, the Son of Heaven feasted by the river’s bend, where *a* refers to the water’s curve. There, he assembled the Six Armies at the southern border of the state of Lin, above Shen Marsh. *Shu* means \"to gather.\"\n\nOn the *wu-yin* day, the Son of Heaven marched west. Moving swiftly, he reached Yangyu Mountain. *Wu* means \"to gallop,\" and *yu* is pronounced *ou*.\n\nThis was the capital of the River Earl Wuyi. Wuyi is Feng Yi, as recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* as Shui Yi. This was the domain of the Hezong clan. The Yellow River is the lord of the Four Floods, and the Hezong took the river as their surname.\n\nHezong Qiaoyao welcomed the Son of Heaven at Yanran Mountain. *Bo Yao* was his courtesy name. He presented gifts of bundled silk and jade, where *lao* refers to the suburban welcoming rites. Five *liang* make one bundle, and one *liang* is now two *zhang*. First, he presented white □, and the Son of Heaven sent Lin Fu to receive them. Lin Fu was Gong Moufu of Lin, the composer of the *Qi Zhao* poem.\n\nOn the *gui-chou* day, the Son of Heaven held a grand court at Yan□ Mountain by the river’s bend. This was likely a gathering of regional officials to announce the impending river rites.\n\nHe then commanded Jing Li, Liang Gu (the grandee of Liang Gate), to lead the Six Armies. *Yu* means \"then.\" The Son of Heaven chose the auspicious day *wu-wu*, as the *Book of Songs* says: \"An auspicious day, *geng-wu*.\"\n\nThe Son of Heaven donned the grand ceremonial attire: the *mian* cap and *zhen* robes. The *mian* is the crown, and the *zhen* is the robe—likely the supreme attire of the queen consort. The emperor’s use of it remains unexplained. *Zhen* is pronounced *hui*. He wore the *qi* sash (the *qi* is a type of *han*, and the Son of Heaven’s was red), the *fu* belt (pronounced *hu*), and the *boliu* jade tablet (three *chi* long, with a shuttle-shaped top, also called *ying* or the Great Jade). *Bo* means \"to gird.\" He was flanked by pendants on both sides, holding a jade tablet and standing southward beneath the *han* (the meaning of *han* is unclear). Zeng Zhu assisted him. *Zeng* means \"double,\" as in the *Records*: \"Your servant Zeng Yan.\" The officials arranged the five sacrificial animals. The types of cattle and sheep are called *sheng*, and a complete body is termed *quan sheng*; some say *quan* refers to pure color. The *Records* state: \"The sacrificial animal is whole and fat.\"\n\nHe presented the jade tablet to the Hezong, and Hezong Boyao received it, facing west to sink the jade into the river. The river’s position is said to be aligned with Kunlun. He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground. *Qi shou* means the head reaches the ground. He then sank the oxen, horses, pigs, and sheep. The Hezong □ invoked the August Son of Heaven, adding *huang* as a term of reverence. The River Earl hailed him, calling: \"Mu Man!\" Using his name was a sign of humility. The word *yan* was likely added later by the chronicler. He said: \"You shall long administer the affairs of the realm!\" This meant King Mu would govern the world for a long time. The Son of Heaven faced south and bowed twice.\n\nThe River Earl hailed him again, saying: \"Mu Man! I show you the jades of Chong Mountain.\" The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* writes *chong* as *lu*, though the pronunciation is the same. This mountain is said to abound in rare treasures. \"I instruct you regarding Kunlun’s □, the Four Level Springs, and the Seventy □.\" These likely describe features of Kunlun Mountain. \"Proceed to Kunlun’s heights to behold the jades of Chong Mountain.\" These were the words exchanged between the River Earl and King Mu. \"I grant you the blessing of the lunar end.\" The month’s end is called *hui*, meaning he bestowed upon him the fullness of fortune.\n\nThe Son of Heaven received the command and faced south, bowing twice.",

As the *Book of Documents* states: “The Son of Heaven fasts for the Six Ancestral Spirits.” *Chou* is pronounced *gui*.\n\nOn the *jiazi* day, the Son of Heaven marched north and lodged at Pearl Marsh, so named for the pearls it yields. (Today, the marshes of Yuelun yield green pearls.) There he fished in the flowing waters. Pearl Marsh spans thirty *li* in circumference—a marsh with grass is called a *sou*. Within it grow *qu* reeds, *guan* rushes, and sweet flags (*guan* and *pu* being variants of the same). Some say *guanpu* is a single name, though in the lands west of the Pass it is called *guan*. (Pronounced *wan*.) There are also taro roots (the character now written as *pu*, pronounced *bei*), *jian* reeds (resembling *qu* but finer, pronounced *jian*), and *po* grasses, a kind of barnyard millet, as the *Book of Songs* says: “In the fourth month, the *yao* grass blooms.”\n\nThen were presented a pair of white jade vessels—one of their three horns could be used for washing—and offered food and ten *fu* of wine, along with nine *guyi* (a delicacy made from elk stomach, smooth to the palate; *zhong* here means “to match”). They also presented three hundred horses fit for the royal kitchen and three thousand head of cattle and sheep.\n\nThe Son of Heaven stationed men at Kunlun—this passage seems to describe the appointment of guardians for the mountain’s flank—to safeguard the Yellow Emperor’s palace, oversee the Red Waters to the south, and protect the treasures of Chong Mountain to the north. This was done to exalt and manifest sagely virtue, thereby making his achievements known to posterity.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon them three or five gold rings (with hollow edges, forming circles), thirty sashes adorned with cowrie shells (as the *Huainanzi* says: “Their cowrie sashes are called *junfan*”), and four *gongbu* textiles. They bowed deeply, touching their heads to the ground in reverence, much like today’s Hu people who, in worshipping the Buddha, raise their hands to their foreheads and say *namo bai* (pronounced *mo*).\n\nThe Son of Heaven further gave them twelve yellow oxen to breed as sacrificial stock and sent thirty men to Kunlun’s heights.\n\nOn the *dingmao* day of late summer, the Son of Heaven ascended Chong Mountain to survey the four wilds, declaring: “Chong Mountain is the loftiest in all the world.” The *zi* trees there bloom in fear of snow, so the Son of Heaven took their blossoms as treasures and carried them back to plant. He said: “The marshes of Chong Mountain yield clear spring waters, warm and still, where black-striped creatures thrive. Here is where birds and beasts come to drink and feed—the place the ancient kings called *Xuanpu*.”\n\nThe *Huainanzi* states: “Kunlun rises eleven thousand *li* above the earth, its summit crowned by nine-tiered walls. Doubling that height is the realm called *Banfeng*; doubling it again is *Xuanpu*, each realm ascending in turn.” The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: “Mingming, Kunlun, and Jingpu are three distinct mountains, though they stand near one another.” It also says: “This is truly the Emperor’s *Pingpu*.”\n\nThere the Son of Heaven obtained the essence of jade, the *Cezhi* branch. *Ying* refers to the finest essence of jade. The *Shizi* says: “Dragon Spring holds jade essence.” The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: “The Yellow Emperor took the jade *ce* from Mount Mi and cast it upon the southern slopes of Mount Zhong.”\n\nHe said: “Chong Mountain is where all beasts gather and birds roost.” There dwelt a certain beast that fed on tigers and leopards, resembling an elk but bearing bony plates upon its back, with a small head and large snout. (*Tang* here means *kang*.) There were also red leopards and white tigers (as the *Book of Songs* says: “Red leopards and yellow lynxes”), bears, brown bears, jackals, wolves, wild horses, wild oxen, mountain goats, and wild boars. (Today, the mountains of Huayin harbor wild oxen and mountain goats, each weighing a thousand *jin*.) There were white crows, green *peng* birds, dogs that herded sheep, and creatures that fed on boars and deer. (Today’s *peng* birds are red and prey on roebucks and deer.)\n\nThe Son of Heaven spent five days observing Chong Mountain’s heights.

The Son of Heaven sent Minister of Sacrifices to receive the offerings, saying: “The lineage of Red Crow first emerged from the Zhou clan, sharing the same ancestral founder. Grand Duke Danfu is the same as the ancient Grand Duke Danfu. He first established the western lands, building his state at the foot of Mount Qi—today’s Mei County in Fufeng. He enfeoffed his eldest son, Tai Bo of Wu, but Tai Bo yielded the throne and entered Wu, whereupon he was enfeoffed there. The edict prescribed punishments with metal blades, for southern gold is keen and refined—thus were their laws framed. Gifts were made with the jades of the Zhou house. (*Hui* means ‘tribute.’) He enfeoffed his minister, Elder Ji Chuo of Mount Chong, at the louse of Chong Mountain, bestowed upon him an eldest daughter in marriage, and prescribed punishments with jade and stone, for Mount Kunlun yields fine jade and stone—thus were their laws framed. He was made lord of the Zhou house.”\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon the people of Red Crow a black-lacquered chariot with four horses (in the *Rites of Zhou*, great officers ride black-lacquered chariots), forty *yi* of gold (one *yi* equals twenty taels), fifty sashes of cowrie shells, and three hundred bolts of vermilion silk. (*Guo* here means ‘bolt.’) *Wu* (a personal name of a Red Crow man) then bowed deeply and received the gifts.\n\nHe said: “This mountain is truly the finest in the world, where treasured jades abide, fine grains grow, and plants and trees flourish in great beauty.” The Son of Heaven thereupon gathered the fine grain and returned with it, planting it in the Central States. (Emperor Wu of Han once took fragrant herbs and fine vegetables from foreign lands and cultivated them in the Central States.)\n\nHe said: “The Son of Heaven rested for five days at the foot of this mountain and then performed grand music.” The man of Red Crow, *Wu*, offered his daughter to the Son of Heaven to forge bonds of favor.

      "translated_text": "On the *guisi* day, they arrived at the Mountain of Lush Jade, which is the Palm Jade Mountain recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*—the abode of the Queen Mother of the West. It was guarded by the Rong□ clan and called the \"Drought Jade Fields.\" The mountain’s slopes were level and unobstructed, its borders devoid of peril, its four sides aligned as if by a carpenter’s line. This was what the former kings had called the \"Repository of Strategies,\" where the ancient sage-kings stored their bamboo slips and books—the so-called \"hiding them in famous mountains.\" The land bore sparse vegetation and no birds or beasts, for it was pure jade and stone. There grew □ trees, which the Western Rong called □.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then took three chariot-loads of jade, along with jade vessels and ceremonial objects—including pendants and girdle ornaments. Thus, he loaded ten thousand *zhi* of jade (a *zhi* of jade being called a \"valley,\" as seen in the *Zuo Tradition*). The Son of Heaven rested for four days on the Mountain of Lush Jade (休 here meaning \"to wander and repose\"), then commanded the Marquis of Xing to await the jade-cutters (待 meaning \"to detain\"; Xing is present-day Xiangyi County in Guangping). On the *dingyou* day of the first autumn month, the Son of Heaven marched north. The people of □ secretly presented him with a feast on Feather Mound, offering fine horses, cattle, and sheep. Because their state excelled in jade-cutting, the Son of Heaven did not accept their sacrificial animals, valuing frugality in such offerings. Wutao said: \"The □ clan are descendants of the Jian□.\"\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon them three sets of six golden jars (孟, called *ying* in Xuzhou) and three hundred bolts of red silk. The □ clan bowed deeply and received them. On the *wuxu* day, the Son of Heaven marched west. On the *xinchou* day, he arrived at the state of the Zhiwen clan (pronounced *Yi*). There, he commanded the Zhiwen to provision the Six Armies (the Son of Heaven’s six hosts, as in the *Odes*: \"The Zhou king marches forth, his six hosts following\") at the foot of Iron Mountain.\n\nOn the *renyin* day, the Son of Heaven ascended Iron Mountain and distributed sacrificial vessels to the Zhiwen people, rewarding them with the remnants of the offering. Wen Gui bowed deeply and received them. After the sacrifice, the Son of Heaven departed and continued west. On the *bingwu* day, he arrived at the state of the Yinghan clan, where there were joyous fields of warmth, fertile wheat lands (the character 草 here is written with 阜 below; likely an ancient form of 茂), and abundant dogs, horses, cattle, and sheep (昌 meaning \"flourishing\"). It was also a place where precious jade was □.\n\nOn the *dingwei* day, the Son of Heaven held a grand court in the midst of the level plains (衍 refers to low-lying land near mounds, as in the *Rites of Zhou*). He then commanded the officers of the Six Armies to rest. On the *jiyou* day, the Son of Heaven held a great feast for the Duke of Zheng, the feudal lords, kings, and officers, as well as the elite Seven Troops, in the midst of the level plains. The people of Yinghan, led by Wu Liang, presented one hundred fine horses, three hundred draft oxen, seven thousand well-trained hunting dogs, two hundred *fang* cattle, three hundred wild horses, two thousand cattle and sheep, and three hundred carts of wheat and barley.\n\nThe Son of Heaven then bestowed upon them four sets of seven golden and silver jars, fifty belts of cowrie shells, three hundred bolts of red silk, and carved official insignia (the characters 变□雕官 appear to be an ancient form of \"upper and lower ranks\"; modern barbarian officials often hold dual titles). They bowed deeply and received the gifts. On the *gengxu* day, the Son of Heaven marched west and arrived at the Dark Pool. He rested there for three days, during which he had grand music performed, concluding after three days. That day, it was called the Medicine Pool. He renamed it the Pool of Grand Music, akin to Emperor Wu of Han renaming a village \"Wenxi\" (\"Hearing Joy\").\n\nThe Son of Heaven then planted bamboo by the pool, calling it the Bamboo Grove (a place dense with bamboo and trees is called a \"grove\"). On the *guichou* day, he continued his westward march. On the *bingchen* day, he arrived at Bitter Mountain, which the Western Rong called the \"Luxuriant Garden.\" There, the Son of Heaven rested and hunted, and they ate the *ku* fruit (a small, edible fruit).

All fine stone implements came from this mountain.\n\nIn the first month of autumn, on the day *guisi*, the Son of Heaven commanded the Chonghu clan to provide sustenance for his retinue. The word \"provide\" (*gong*) here implies they were not part of the Six Armies. Five days later, on *dingyou*, the Son of Heaven ascended the Mountain of Colored Stones and there gathered its stones. He ordered the people of Chonghu to smelt them into implements by the Black Waters. Even now, those who forge implements in foreign lands still use such stones. The vessels, garments, ornaments, and adornments were boundless, and the Son of Heaven rested for a month.\n\nOn the autumn day *guihai*, the Son of Heaven feasted the widower *Guanlie* of the Chonghu clan and bestowed upon him two sets of nine jars of gold, one silver raven, fifty cowrie belts, seven hundred bundles of cinnabar, a hundred measures each of cassia and ginger, and silk cords with carved ornaments. *Guanlie* prostrated and received them.\n\nOn *yichou*, the Son of Heaven set out eastward, and *Guanlie* escorted him to the Mountain of Changsha. There, the Son of Heaven ordered Wuyao to receive him. Wuyao said: \"The ancestors of the Chonghu clan were descendants of the Sanmiao clan, who dwelled in [lacuna] and worked with yellow wood, wax, silver, and colored stones.

On *jisi*, he arrived at Wenshan, called [lacuna] by the people of Western Mo, where they feasted the Son of Heaven. The people of Western Mo then presented three hundred horses, two thousand cattle and sheep, and a thousand carts of unhusked rice. The Son of Heaven ordered Biju to receive them, saying: \"[Lacuna] the Son of Heaven roamed Wenshan for three days.\" There he gathered colored stones, and because of these stones, the mountain was named Wenshan.\n\nOn *renyin*, the Son of Heaven drank beneath Wenshan. The people of Wenshan, whose name was *Guiwei*, presented ten teams of fine horses (a team being four horses), three hundred oxen, ninety guard dogs, and two hundred *fang* cattle to traverse the Flowing Sands.

Some say *wei* is also a name for dogs. The *hao* sheep resemble *mao* cattle.\n\nThirty offerings were made to Wenshan. The Son of Heaven also bestowed upon *Guiwei* two sets of nine jars of gold, thirty cowrie belts, three hundred bundles of cinnabar, and a hundred hills of cassia and ginger. *Guiwei* prostrated and received them.\n\nOn *guiyou*, the Son of Heaven ordered the harnessing of the Eight Steeds. The right trace horse was *Diliu* (possibly a scribal error for *Bixun*), and the left was *Lü’er*. The right outer horse was *Jiaochilong* (an ancient form of *ji*, \"steed\"), and the left was *Baiyi*.

      "translated_text": "Guo Pu of Jin annotates the ancient text *Treasured Records*, stating: \"The Son of Heaven rested at Huo Marsh for four days—this is present-day Huo Marsh County in Pingyang. The pronunciation of *huo* is *hutè*. There, he shot crows and hunted beasts.\n\nOn *dingshou*, the Son of Heaven [text corrupt] arrived at his destination. Ji Fu, the Earl of Pu, came from Pu Zheng to pay his respects. Zheng had fields called Pu, hence the name Pu Zheng. *Yè* means 'to report.' He presented a hundred pieces of jade from the state of Liukun, as Liukun is recorded in the *Bamboo Annals*. The Rong of Lingdi offered tribute: Lingdi was a state of the Chen clan. The pronunciation of *ling* is *jùn*. They brought a hundred teams of fine horses—*The Tradition* states: 'a hundred teams of patterned horses.' They returned the treasures of Bi, as Bi was a state. This refers to the Di having previously taken these treasures, now seeking reconciliation. *Chéng* means 'peace.' *Gǔ* means 'to demand.'\n\nThe Lord of Jun, Hu [text corrupt] Dongmu—among the Yi and Di, those of virtue are called *zi*. *Chóu* is a Hu name—met the Viscount of Xu at the banks of the Wei River. *Nán* is a rank of nobility. Xu is the present-day Xu Chang County, where the Xiao River flows. The pronunciation of *wěi* is *yǔměi* (reversed).\n\nJi Fu, speaking on the Son of Heaven’s behalf, said: 'Depart from this lamb and present jade and silk.' By ritual, a viscount holds a rush-matted jade disc, but the Viscount of Xu, wishing to display humility, held a lamb instead. The Viscount of Xu dared not refuse and accepted the royal command. He then took eastern silk and added it to the jade, while the Duke of Mao presented ceremonial jade. The Duke of Mao was Mao Ban.\n\nOn that day, the Son of Heaven feasted the Viscount of Xu by the Wei River. The Son of Heaven said: 'Were it not for the state of Xu, I would not have shown such concern for the people [text corrupt].' The Ji clan’s banquets lacked propriety, for ritual dictates that the Son of Heaven address those of different surnames as 'uncle' or 'elder.' Feasts are private gatherings, not intended to elevate ritual propriety. As *The Guanzi* states: 'The uncle does not bow below.' The character is also written as *jiù* (uncle), and *jiù* here means the same. The Viscount of Xu dared not refuse and ascended to sit at the *chūzūn*—*The Rites* states: 'To turn the jade and present the *chūzūn* is only done when two lords are on good terms.' After offering the toast and returning the cup, the *chūzūn* was placed above, akin to this custom. He was seated beside the honored vessel and made the master of the wine, so that the feast might proceed with unbridled joy.\n\nThen they indulged in banquet music, referring to an intimate feast. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon the Viscount of Xu sixteen fine horses—*jùn* denotes renowned steeds. The Viscount of Xu descended and performed the *kōngshǒu* bow, where the head touches the ground. *The Rites of Zhou* states: 'On the third day, the *kōng* bow is performed.' He then ascended to sit in peaceful accord.\n\nAt dusk, the Son of Heaven permitted the Viscount of Xu to return home.\"",

Bēnróng bowed twice, knocking his forehead to the ground.\n\nOn the *bǐngchén* day, the Son of Heaven journeyed north into the forest, where he received a great mandate before returning.

The state of Huò now lies southwest of Yǒng’ān County in Píngyáng, where its city walls remain.\n\nThe Son of Heaven ascended Jūnqiū, hunting in the marshes.

Hán Fēi said: *\"The Dao comes from the south.\"* He then planted a paulownia, for the paulownia is a resonant wood. When made into a drum, it would resound with divine power, proving advantageous in warfare and suitable for attacking the Róng. When made into a zither, it would also be propitious.\n\nHe traveled to Huángzé, journeying east to lodge at Qūluò—a bend in the Luò River, the name of the place. He dismissed [his attendants], ordering the palace musicians to sing.

The Son of Heaven composed three verses of poetry to lament the people’s suffering—*\"lament\"* meaning to pity. He said:\n*\"My ancestor at Yellow Bamboo,\n[the land] wide and bitterly cold.\nThe Emperor gathers the Nine Ways—\n‘Ways’ mean paths,\nspeaking of encompassing the roads of the Nine Regions.\nAs *The Zuǒ Tradition* says: ‘The Nine Roads were opened.’\nAlas, my lords and marquises,\nthe hundred rulers and chief ministers—\n‘Rulers’ mean lords; ‘chief ministers’ mean the grand stewards.\nCorrect our ten thousand people,\n‘Correct’ means to set aright.\ndo not forget them day or night.\nEver remember them.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *Tradition* states: He entered Kuailing. *Kuai* is pronounced in two ways: *diān* and *lǐng*. He then encamped on the northern bank of the Huan River. This is today’s Huán Ford, located in Heyang County north of the Yellow River. *Huán* is pronounced like the *dòu* in *xiàngdòu*. On the auspicious day *dīnghài*, the Son of Heaven entered Southern Zheng.\n\n*Scroll Five of the* Transmission of King Mu *ends here.*\n*Scroll Six of the* Transmission of King Mu.\nWith annotations by Guo Pu of Jin. In the ancient script:\n\n...the desolate ruins, the emperor’s renown. Thereupon [he] ascended the Nine Observances with the Former Master to instruct later generations. This was again an ascent of a famous mountain, where inscriptions were carved and enfeoffments established. Many characters are missing and cannot be reconstructed.\n\nOn the *jǐsì* day, the Son of Heaven marched forth and lodged at Zhi Terrace. On the *xīnwèi* day, he hunted the beasts of Niuzhi. The *Guanzi* states: *Zhi* refers to the soil of vegetable fields. Today, the people of Wu call hunting grounds overgrown with grass *zhi*. Thereupon, a white deer suddenly burst free and fled. This means it broke through the encirclement. *Wù* means to strike the ground. Some say the deer he had harnessed was still present, yet startled. The Son of Heaven mounted the chariot drawn by Quhuang steeds.\n\nFrom here onward, the text likely describes the pursuit and capture of the deer. The Son of Heaven named it, *qiū* being a designation in the local dialect. This was called the Office of the Five Deer, and the place was named Qiukou. He flayed its hide, calling it *Qiupi*; he dried its meat, calling it *Qiupu*. The Son of Heaven drank by the waters of the Ta River. The Ta River is today’s Ta County in Jiyin. *Tà* is pronounced *yǎo*. The officials prepared venison and offered it to the Son of Heaven, who found it delicious, calling it *Gan*. From this point onward, all places were named after the deer to commemorate the event. Today, in the eastern outskirts of Yuancheng County, there is a Five Deer Ruin, where Duke Wen of Jin begged for food from a peasant.\n\nOn the *guǐyǒu* day, the Son of Heaven sacrificed a white deer to the south at the Ta Ford, then drank to the west in the midst of the wild grass. A grand performance of music was held, *grand* meaning a magnificent display. This was called the Musician’s Place, also recorded to mark the occasion.\n\nOn the *jiǎxū* day, the Son of Heaven traveled northwest to the Ji clan, the daughter of Sheng Wu. *Sheng* was the name of a state. The preceding passage likely concerns the Ji matter. The *Gongyang Commentary* states: What is *Cheng*? *Sheng* is used to avoid taboo, for *Sheng* and *Qi* are homophonous, and those of the same surname [must avoid such names]. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon her the leadership of the Upper Ji, for Sheng Wu was the chief of the Ji clan, holding the highest rank. This was called Sheng Gate. The Son of Heaven then built a terrace for her, constructing a terrace for Sheng Ji. This was called the Terrace of Layered Jade, for the terrace resembled stacked jade discs.\n\nOn the *wùyín* day, the Son of Heaven hunted eastward in the marsh and encountered a cold illness. This means Sheng Ji contracted a chill from the wind there. The Son of Heaven lodged in the marsh, and Sheng Ji fell ill. The Son of Heaven pitied her and named the marsh *Han* Marsh after her. Sheng Ji requested a drink, and the Son of Heaven ordered someone to fetch broth swiftly. The *Tradition* asks: How swiftly it was obtained! This was called Hulun. *Hu* is the name of a vessel; *lun*, pronounced *yí*, means swift, akin to *sù*.\n\nThe Son of Heaven traveled west to the Terrace of Layered Jade, where Sheng Ji’s illness worsened. The Son of Heaven mourned her; the preceding passage likely describes Sheng Ji’s death. This was called the Mourning Station, the place where he wept. The Son of Heaven then interred Sheng Ji in the ancestral temple of Guqiu. There were ancestral temples of former kings here. The Han dynasty also had temples in such places.\n\nOn the *rényín* day, the Son of Heaven commanded mourning, ordering the ministers to attend the grand lamentation. Qi served as the principal mourner, acting as the master of the funeral rites. The preceding *Qi* likely refers to opening the coffin. He sacrificed to Father Bin, who assisted with the funeral rites. The Son of Heaven’s daughter, Shu Zhi, served as the principal mourner. *Shu* was her clan name; she was King Mu’s daughter. *Càn* is pronounced like *zuò*. The Son of Heaven ordered the completion of the mourning rites for the guests, commanding that the funeral rites be carried out to their conclusion. Thereupon, they performed the *shang* sacrifice and wept. *Shang* refers to an incomplete mourning, for Sheng Ji was young.\n\nThe Grand Scribe held the bamboo slips to record the posthumous gifts. The Grand Scribe was responsible for decrees. The officials arranged the mats and set up the armrests, *fū* meaning to spread. The *Rites of Zhou* states: In mourning affairs, follow the general rules. The sacrificial preparations were made, *jì* referring to the offerings. The lung stew and meat were pronounced accordingly. *Zài* refers to the dried meat of large game, *zǎo* to jujube wine, and *xù* to clear gruel, pronounced *yí*. *Yùn* refers to meat sauce, *yú là* to dried fish, *mó hán* to cold gruel, and *jiǔ* to leeks, pronounced *yì*. All things were prepared, indicating completeness.\n\nThe raw offerings were arranged on twelve stands, ninety dried dishes were presented, and forty tripods, *dūn* vessels, *hú* jars, and *zūn* goblets were set out. *Dūn* resembles a tray, pronounced *duī*. The vessels were miscellaneous utensils. The *zēng* and *zhù* officials performed the sacrificial feast. Though it was a funeral sacrifice, they still offered food, showing precedence.\n\nThe lung was presented, and the libation wine was poured, using the lung to exchange for salt and sprinkling it in the middle as an offering, called the *zhèn* sacrifice. The rite involved presenting the lung to the *shaolao* sacrificial animal. They then offered the sacrifice to the funeral master Yi Xu, who bowed and received it. The female officiant then offered it to the female principal mourner, Shu Zhi, who bowed and received it. The *zhù* official reported the completion of the sacrifice to the Grand Master, the music official.\n\nThey then wept in their positions, taking their places for the mourning rites. After the weeping concluded, the Grand Scribe read the bamboo slips and wept. *Cè* here should be read as *dú*; in the *Rites for the Evening*, it states: The master’s scribe reads the eulogy. The *zēng* and *zhù* officials held the offerings and wept, *pěng* meaning to hold with both hands. The charioteers prayed and wept. The etiquette for attendants states: The charioteers enter to bathe. The *kàng* officials raised the libation cups and wept at dusk, *kàng* meaning to lift. The *Liji* states: Four minor officials lift the *niǎo*. The *zuǒ* officials held the *dǒu* ladles and wept, for they were the assistants in charge of the funeral. *Dǒu* refers to the water-dipping ladle. The *zuǒ* officials assisted with food and drink. The mourners wore robes and sashes with pendants and wept. The musicians arranged zithers, se harps, *yú* pipes—*yú* here should be *shēng*, for the *shēng* is a type of *yú*—and *yuè* flutes, which resemble three-holed flutes. These were the instruments blown by the officers. The *guǎn* pipes resembled two flutes joined together, pronounced *guǎn*.",

His father’s brothers, the clan elders, and those in office followed him. The assistants wept, for they were the attendants in charge of the funeral.

      "translated_text": "The supply and provisioning between the Yellow and Ji Rivers were jointly managed. The warriors of the three states—Wei Valley, Huang City, and the third—attended the mourning, their biers drawn by man-powered transport carts. The masses of the three states were mobilized to display grandeur and extravagance.\n\nThe Seven Elite warriors lifted the coffin onto the hearse, raising it to mount the vehicle. The *zeng*-priest led the funeral procession as the guide. The Grand Artisan drove the coffin-cart, serving as its charioteer. As the *Zhou Rituals* states: \"The mourning *zhu*-priest acts as the charioteer.\" The *Records of Ritual* says: \"The feudal lords’ coffins are escorted with feathered guards,\" referring to those who precede the procession to regulate its pace.\n\nBanners bore the sun and moon, and the pattern of the Seven Stars—the Northern Dipper—was emblazoned on the *yu*-flags. As the *Records of Ritual* states: \"The sun and moon are depicted on the banners,\" a term also used generally for standards. Drums and bells accompanied the burial.\n\nDragon banners were arrayed alongside, ravens adorned the battle drums, and beasts embellished the bells. Dragons adorned the flags. The order of the funeral procession, the sequence of wailing and leaping, and all matters concerning the bells, banners, and the hundred funeral implements were overseen by Jing Li, arranged in the mourning ranks without the slightest omission.\n\nThe ranks were organized in formation. Drums sounded to advance the funeral procession, while banners were raised to encourage the mourners to fully express their grief. Bells were struck to halt the wailing, and banners were lowered to regulate the rhythm—this refers to the modulation of sound. The banners were lowered, meaning they were dipped.\n\nOn the day of the *xī*-sacrifice, a great wailing was held nine times to conclude the mourning rites. Upon exiting the gate, the chief mourner took his position to assume the place of wailing. The royal house’s fathers, elder brothers, sons, and grandsons formed double ranks—*bei* meaning to arrange in twofold rows. The feudal lords’ affiliated sons and the clan’s affiliated sons clung to the coffin. The royal officials formed double ranks, while the external officials and the royal retinue of the Seven Elite warriors also doubled their ranks. The external officials were those whose duties lay outside the court.\n\nThe Ji-clan descendants doubled their ranks, being Lady Sheng’s kin. Those holding office doubled their ranks—*zhizhi* meaning those performing duties. The assembled officials and commoners doubled their ranks, and the wailers formed sevenfold ranks, arranged in seven layers. The leapers formed thirty rows, each row consisting of a hundred men—a hundred men made one *bei*. *Cui* means \"to gather.\"\n\nThe female chief mourner took her position, with the *bi*-women and the grass-women doubling their ranks. The *bi*-women were those favored and beloved by the king. The king’s ministers’ Ji-clan daughters doubled their ranks—likely referring to women of the same clan who were wives of high officials and officers, known as the inner clan. The palace women doubled their ranks, as palace officials were internal. The palace’s worthy concubines and common concubines doubled their ranks. The common concubines were the numerous scattered concubines. The wailers formed fivefold ranks, and the leapers followed in order.",

The funeral procession advanced three *she* until reaching the mourning station, then five *she* until arriving at the Terrace of Double Jade. One *she* equaled thirty *li*.

As the *Book of Documents* states: \"King Wu was indisposed.\" The Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao then offered condolences to the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince wept as he emerged from the temple gate to welcome the Marquis of Xing, but the Marquis of Cao did not advance. The Crown Prince bowed twice to express gratitude—an inquiry of consolation. The marquises did not return the bow, humbly declining to stand on equal ritual footing with the Crown Prince.\n\nThe Marquis of Xing announced his mourning at the temple. *Ye* means to notify. The Crown Prince wept first before entering, then took his position facing west. The Inner Scribe, acting as the host for the marquises, stood facing north. They wailed loudly nine times. The Marquis of Xing performed three sets of leaping and stamping before ceasing. He and the Crown Prince exchanged ritual gestures. The Crown Prince escorted the Marquis of Xing beyond the temple gate, whereupon the marquis departed. The Crown Prince bowed twice in farewell.\n\nThe Marquis of Cao entered the temple to offer condolences and weep, and the Crown Prince saw him off with the same rites as for the Marquis of Xing. Though the occasions of mourning differed, the ritual was identical.\n\nOn the *renzi* day, the Son of Heaven, with all officials in attendance, received the Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao. *Ju guan* means to prepare the full rites for an audience. The Son of Heaven then turned back, preparing to return. The Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao performed the *zhi jian* bow to the Son of Heaven’s martial retinue—a gesture of obscure significance. The Son of Heaven received them and then dispatched the Marquis of Xing and the Marquis of Cao back to their states. The royal officials continued to observe proper ritual in their interactions with the two marquises, demonstrating that mourning did not suspend propriety.\n\nIt was said that the Son of Heaven issued decrees—*xian* commands—with some enforcing flogging as punishment.

      "translated_text": "At the artisans' entry into the upper chamber, dawn had not yet broken. The Son of Heaven dispatched the jade-workers to those he cherished. For the posthumous gifts, nine sets of patterned brocade and luminous robes were used—these were called \"luminous robes,\" garments of the radiant spirit. The funeral director Yi Hu presented altered skirts, for the director also presided. \"Altered skirts\" was the name of the garment. The female director Shu Cuo offered brocade mattresses and woven sashes—mat and cushion. All the jade-workers and their officers completed the gifts, referring to the painted and embroidered offerings. \"Officers\" was the title for military men. As the *Liji* states: \"Officers share one ancestral temple.\" Jing Li then interred them. The interment took place at the tomb site, and the cortege returned to wail at the grand encampment—\"returned\" meaning to go back. The grand encampment was the divine resting place of the spirit. Xiang Ke [text missing] performed the funeral rites, ceasing the wailing and bidding farewell to distant mourners, dismissing them with gratitude.\n\nFor Sheng Ji, her posthumous title was \"One Morning’s Virtuous Lady.\" A reverent person cut short in life was called \"mournful.\" The Son of Heaven ordered the grave-diggers to name the mound \"Mound of the Virtuous Lady.\" On the *yichou* day, the Son of Heaven marched eastward, halting at Wu Lu. The Shu clan mourned and wept, grieving for Sheng Ji. That day was named \"Mound of the Weeping Woman,\" and thus Wu Lu was so called. On the *dingmao* day, the Son of Heaven marched eastward, fishing at the Luo River to sacrifice to the Virtuous Lady—this day was the \"Sacrificial Mound.\" On the *jisi* day, the Son of Heaven continued eastward, feeding his horses by the Luo River, then striking the thornwood drum—this day was the \"Horse Master.\" The significance remains unclear.\n\nOn the *dayou* day, the Son of Heaven marched southward, arriving at Zhi Terrace. In midwinter, on the *jiaxu* day, the Son of Heaven marched westward, reaching the land of the Yin clan—a state’s name. There, he fished in the Yellow River to observe the Gu Xian trees. Gu Xian referred to great trees. The *Shanhaijing* states: \"The Xun tree stretches a thousand *li*, growing by the sea.\" This was likely the same type of tree. On the *dingsi* day, the Son of Heaven marched northward. On the *wuyin* day, he encamped by the river and summoned his uncles, elder and younger brothers, sons, and royal ministers—Ji [text missing]—to complete the sacrificial rites and final wailing. As mentioned earlier, the royal ministers were women of the Ji clan; this likely refers to the same. The mourning concluded at the land of the Gao clan, and the period of mourning ended.\n\nOn the *jimao* day, the Son of Heaven crossed the Yellow River westward at the Gao clan’s ford. On the *gengchen* day, he encamped at Mao Chi—a place name. There, he performed the village sacrifice to mark the end of mourning, beginning the music anew. He wore plain robes on his return, his grief not yet forgotten. That day was named \"Plain Clan.\" The Son of Heaven then journeyed southwest. On the *kuiwei* day, he arrived at Ye Wang—present-day Henan County.

The Seven Guardians’ warrior, Po Yu, remonstrated with the Son of Heaven, saying: “Since ancient times, there has been death and there has been life—how could Lady Sheng alone be thus?” The Son of Heaven remained inconsolable, his grief boundless in endless remembrance. “Endless remembrance is of benefit, yet do not forget what is new.” These words meant that while remembrance is of benefit, one should not forget to seek new companions. The Son of Heaven, overcome with sorrow, wept once more. Upon hearing these words, he recalled how Lady Sheng had once been. That day was named “Cessation.”\n\nOn the *jiwei* day, and again on the *yiyou* day, the Son of Heaven crossed westward over the Xing Peak, ascending the slopes of Mount Yan. It is said that on the *guisi* day, he roamed Mount Jing Yan—*guisi* being an auspicious day. He then continued southwest. On the *wuzi* day, he arrived at Fu.
