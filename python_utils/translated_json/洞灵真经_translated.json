  "full_translation": "**The Authentic Scripture of Penetrating Spirit**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Authentic Scripture of Penetrating Spirit*. Originally titled *Kang Cangzi*. Compiled by Wang Shiyuan of the Tang dynasty, excerpting and rearranging ancient texts such as the *Zhuangzi*, falsely attributed to Geng Duozi of the Warring States period. During the Tianbao era of the Tang, it was designated as one of the Four Authentic Scriptures of Daoism. Originally in three scrolls, later consolidated into one. Base text sourced from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Section of Penetrating Spirit*, *Category of Original Texts*. Collated with the *Third Series of the Sibu Congkan*, a facsimile of the Song dynasty printed edition held in the Tieqin Tongjian Library of the Qu family of Changshu (hereafter referred to as the Song edition).\n\n---\n\n**The Authentic Scripture of Penetrating Spirit**\n\n**Geng Sangzi**\n\nAmong the disciples of Laozi was one named Geng Sang Chu, a man of Chen. He had partially attained the Dao of Laozi and dwelled on Mount Weilei. Those among his ministers who were ostentatiously wise departed from him; those among his concubines who were fastidiously benevolent distanced themselves. Only the coarse and the toiling remained, serving him with simplicity. After three years, Weilei flourished greatly.\n\nLater, he traveled to Wu and concealed himself on Meng Peak in Piling, where he perfected the Dao and ascended as an immortal. Subsequently, the Han dynasty Master Zhang Tianshi (Fu Guang) and the Tang dynasty Zhang Guolao successively secluded themselves there for cultivation, and the site became known as Zhang Gong’s Altar of Blessed Land. An ancient temple, the Dongling Abbey, was built, later renamed the Tianshen Wanshou Palace during the Song dynasty.\n\nHe authored nine chapters, titled *Geng Sangzi*, also known as *Kang Cangzi*. In the Tang dynasty, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Penetrating Spirit, and his work was titled *The Authentic Scripture of Penetrating Spirit*.\n\n---\n\n**The Authentic Scripture of Penetrating Spirit**\n**Chapter One: The Complete Dao**\n\nKang Cangzi dwelled at the foot of Yu Mountain for three years, during which the land knew no plague and the grain ripened in abundance. The locals whispered among themselves: \"When Kang Cangzi first arrived, we thought him strange, but now our daily reckoning falls short while our yearly harvest overflows. Could he be a sage? Why not together honor him as an ancestral spirit, worship him as a tutelary deity of the soil and grain?\"\n\nKang Cangzi, hearing this, bore an expression of disquiet. His disciple Yan Chuai approached and inquired, to which Kang Cangzi replied: \"I have heard that the perfected one dwells in a humble abode, yet the people roam wildly, unaware of his comings and goings. Now the folk of Yu, fathers and sons alike, secretly scheme to offer me sacrificial vessels—am I truly such a man? This is why I cannot dismiss the words of Lao Dan.\"\n\nYan Chuai said: \"Otherwise, consider this: in a shallow puddle, even a great fish cannot turn its body, and so the newt and loach rule over it; on a hillock of a few paces, even a mighty beast cannot conceal itself, and so the wretched fox and its ilk become omens. From Yao and Shun onward, it has ever been thus—exalting the worthy, striving for merit, inclining toward goodness, and pursuing profit. How much more so for the folk of Yu? Master, you should heed them.\"\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"Hmph! Come here, you two—do you truly understand?\"\n\nThe beast of the enclosed chariot, armored yet parted from the mountains, is ensnared by nets and snares; the fish that could swallow a boat, adrift and bereft of water, is tormented by ants and mole-crickets. Thus birds and beasts dwell where they desire the heights, fish and turtles where they desire the depths. For those who preserve their form and life, concealing themselves is nothing more than seeking the deepest obscurity.\n\nI speak to you of the root of great disorder, which began in the time of Yao and Shun, and will endure to the end of ages. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.\n\nBefore the words were finished, Nan Zirong’s expression shifted, and he abruptly rose from his mat, saying: \"I have long followed the cycles of years—how then shall I entrust my life to this teaching?\"\n\nKang Cangzi replied: \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts race restlessly. If you follow this thread of years, perhaps you may yet reach this truth. Though my talent is small and insufficient to transform you, why not journey south to seek my master, Dan?\"\n\nAfter Kang Cangzi declined Zirong’s offer, he did not abandon the customs of Yu, yet the world had already become like a dragon soaring in the heavens.\n\nWater by nature desires clarity, but earth muddies it, so it cannot remain clear. Man by nature desires longevity, but things muddy it, so he cannot attain it. Things exist to nourish our nature, yet the deluded of this age often use their nature to nourish things, failing to distinguish weight from lightness. Thus the sage, in matters of sound, color, and flavor, takes what benefits his nature and discards what harms it—this is the Way of preserving one’s nature.\n\nA thousand men draw their bows, all arrows aimed at a single target—none will miss. The myriad things flourish, yet their flourishing harms the one life—none will escape injury. Therefore, the sage’s regulation of the myriad things preserves their Heaven. When Heaven is preserved, the spirit is preserved. The man of whole spirit acts without deliberation yet penetrates all, plans without scheming yet attains what is fitting. His essence illuminates without bound, his will congeals with the cosmos, his virtue descends like Heaven itself. Whether above as Son of Heaven or below as a common man, he remains unarrogant and unpresumptuous—such is the man of the whole Way.\n\nA mind level and upright, undisturbed by external things, is called pure. Purity enduring becomes clarity; clarity enduring becomes emptiness. In emptiness, the Dao is whole and dwells within.\n\nWhen Qin Yi died, Kang Cangzi wept for him. His servant said: \"The whole world dies—why do you weep, Master?\"\n\nKang Cangzi replied: \"If the whole world weeps, how can I not weep?\"\n\nThe servant said: \"Those who weep must grieve, yet you show no grief—why?\"\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"In all beneath Heaven, I have none with whom to rejoice—where then shall I find grief?\"\n\nShedding and falling is called water; shedding water is called qi; shedding qi is called emptiness; shedding emptiness is called the Dao.\n\nEmptiness is the body of the Dao; tranquility is the ground of the Dao; principle is the guiding thread of the Dao; discernment is the eye of the Dao.\n\nThe Dao preserves the spirit; virtue expands one’s capacity; ritual orders conduct; things nourish the body.\n\nThose who favor inherently white things deem black as filth; those who favor inherently black things deem white as filth. How then can I know what is truly pure or defiled in the world? Thus I do not give rise to judgments of purity or defilement in things.\n\nThe color-blind see yellow as red and green as black—what I call black and white, how can the discerning not mistake for crimson and yellow? How then can I know what is truly the correct color in the world? Thus I do not flee from the colors of things.\n\nThose who covet wealth excessively see no other things as desirable; those who love horses excessively see no other things as desirable; those who love books excessively see no other things as desirable. How then can I know what in the world is truly worthy of love or truly worthy of aversion? Thus I do not see things as objects of attachment, and nothing can disturb my long and unbroken note.\n\nMarquis Chen Huai sent his grandee to perform a diplomatic visit to Lu. Viscount Sun privately asked: \"Does your state have a sage? Do you know of him?\" The grandee of Chen replied: \"How can one clearly prove his sagacity?\" Viscount Sun said: \"He can set aside the mind and employ the body.\" The grandee of Chen said: \"Our humble state is small, yet it too has a sage, one different from what you have heard. Who is this sage?\" Viscount Sun asked. The grandee of Chen replied: \"There is one called Kang Cangzi, who has fully attained the Dao of Lao Dan. He can use his ears to see and his eyes to hear.\"\n\nDuke Ding heard of this and found it extraordinary. He sent the Viscount Sun to return the visit and to invite Kang Cangzi, receiving him with the rites due to a high minister. Kang Cangzi arrived and was lodged in the secondary guest quarters. The Duke of Lu spoke humbly to inquire of him. Kang Cangzi said: \"I can hear and see without using ears and eyes—not that I reverse the functions of ears and eyes, but the one who reported this was mistaken.\"\n\nThe Duke said: \"How can this be? You increase my wonder. What is the nature of your Dao? I truly wish to hear of it.\" Kang Cangzi said: \"My body unites with my mind, my mind unites with my qi, my qi unites with my spirit, my spirit unites with nothingness. With this resolute presence and resonant tone, though distant as the farthest reaches beyond the eight wilds or near as the space between my brows, whatever comes to engage me, I know it completely—yet I do not know that I know. What my seven orifices, hands, and feet perceive, what my six bowels, five viscera, and heart-mind apprehend, is known only to myself.\"\n\n**Using the Dao, Chapter Two**\n\nHeaven cannot be trusted; falling cannot be trusted; people cannot be trusted; the heart cannot be trusted. Only the Dao can be trusted. How can worthy rulers and outstanding scholars be known?\n\nIn ancient times, Jie trusted Heaven and his ancestral dominion over the Four Seas, yet he did not diligently follow the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Yin. Zhou also trusted Heaven and his ancestral dominion over the Four Seas, yet he did not personally cultivate the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Zhou.\n\nNow, the farmer trusts that falling brings forth the hundred grains, yet if he does not exert himself in the Dao, falling will steal his harvest and leave it overgrown and desolate. The Marquis of Qi trusted human nature’s propensity for yielding and deference, yet he did not understand the Dao. He handed over his entire realm to others, and those others, like owls and jackals, seized his state.\n\nGenerally, if one does not cultivate the Dao but follows the heart and takes it as teacher, indulging desires and luxuriating in excess, disasters, illnesses, and conflicts will arise, harming the body and shortening life. The heart is the source of this harm. Thus it is said: only the Dao can be trusted.\n\nHeaven and falling, without the Dao, cannot endure long; the common people, without worthies, cannot be pacified and compliant; government affairs, without talent, cannot be harmonized and ordered.\n\nThose who employ the Dao do not display their use of it. Blessings flourish and nourish the myriad things, yet no credit is claimed. Spirit merges and undertakings prosper; numinous blessings endure long.\n\nKnowing and distinguishing is called discernment; knowing and not distinguishing is called the Dao. Discernment is for governing people; the Dao is for pacifying people.\n\nThe rooster crows at dawn and labors under the sun, sweat dripping to the ground. At midnight, he barely rests—this is the Dao of the farmer. Stooping to gather, reaching to take, sharpening the mind and concentrating effort, striving with all one’s strength and essence to seek profit—this is the Dao of the merchant. Ingesting qi and refining the spirit, restraining thoughts and reducing concerns, transcending and lightly ascending, refining the essence of the sun to become an immortal—this is the Dao of the lofty scholar. Cutting off emotions and focusing intentions, dedicating oneself wholly to one’s duties, deliberating and measuring while forgetting sleep—this is the Dao of the minister. Purifying the mind and reducing thoughts, examining and verifying close attendants, diligently seeking talented and good men to pacify the myriad people—this is the Dao of the ruler.\n\nIf one follows these categories, each in accord with its measure and intent, not abandoning or obstructing their respective paths, this is called the world having the Dao.\n\nGuiding the sinews and bones preserves the wholeness of form; pruning emotions and desires preserves the wholeness of spirit; quieting speech preserves the wholeness of fortune. Perfecting these three wholenesses is called pure worthiness.\n\nWhen the Dao and virtue flourish, ghosts and spirits assist; when trust and integrity are sincere, noble persons gather; when ritual and propriety are complete, petty persons submit.\n\nThose with discernment are self-assured; those without discernment are also self-assured. Those with the Dao are tranquil and silent; the dull and obtuse are also tranquil and silent.\n\nThings inherently have what seems right but is wrong, seems wrong but is right. Some weep first and laugh later; some begin auspiciously and end inauspiciously. Some bodies can be drawn close, yet their talents are unworthy of closeness; some talents command respect, yet their bodies are unworthy of respect. Excessive respect precludes intimacy; excessive intimacy precludes respect. Drawing close may lead to estrangement; keeping distance may lead to closeness.\n\nExcessive kindness breeds resentment; excessive love invites hatred. Some value speed; some value slowness; some value straightness; some value crookedness. The appropriateness of all things arises from the subtlest of origins—this cannot be unknown. Thus the wise find it difficult.\n\nStillness allows the spirit to penetrate; adversity sharpens the mind; nobility refines speech; wealth liberates the body—such is the natural order of principle and circumstance.\n\nThose who share the Dao love one another; those who vie for the same rank envy one another. Those who give together love one another; those who seize together envy one another. The sick love one another; the strong envy one another—such is the nature of human sentiment.\n\nTo possess great talent yet cherish humility; to endure poverty and low station without flattery; to labor without feeling disgraced; to hold high rank and wealth yet grow ever more reverent and diligent—this may be called one of virtue.\n\n**On the Dao of Governance, Chapter Three**\n\nWithout method, people cannot know the cycles of heaven’s four seasons, cold and heat, or the movements of the sun, moon, and stars. Yet if they knew the proper course of heaven’s four seasons, cold and heat, and the movements of the sun, moon, and celestial bodies, then all living creatures of blood and qi would find their place and rest securely in their stations.\n\nLikewise, ministers have no method to know where their lord’s rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments will fall. Yet if they knew the proper application of the lord’s rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments, then the near and far, worthy and unworthy would all exhaust their talents and be put to use.\n\nWhen trust is complete, the world is at peace; when trust is lost, the world is in peril. If the people toil exhaustively and their resources are depleted, contentious and harmful thoughts arise, and trust vanishes.\n\nWhen people lose trust, it stems from governance that is not impartial. When governance is not impartial, it is the fault of the officials. When officials are at fault, it is because punishments and rewards are inconsistent. When punishments and rewards are inconsistent, it is because the ruler is not diligent and enlightened.\n\nIf the ruler is diligent and enlightened, punishments and rewards become uniform. When punishments and rewards are uniform, officials uphold the law. When officials uphold the law, governance flows downward. When governance flows downward, the people find their place and trust one another.\n\nThus, the loss of trust throughout the world stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and enlightenment.\n\nWhen Kang Cangzi dwelled in Xirang for five years, King Ling sent the Duke of Zhai with a basket of silk and a string of fine jade, saying: “I, your humble servant, occupy this position unworthily. With untimely floods and droughts, I, as a mere mortal, wonder how to avert them?”\n\nKang Cangzi replied: “Floods are a disorder of yin. In governance, yin resembles punishment; in human affairs, it resembles selfishness. Drought is an excess of yang. In governance, yang resembles virtue; in human affairs, it resembles fullness.\n\nThe state of Chu holds that whenever floods or droughts occur, the Son of Heaven should rectify punishments and cultivate virtue, while all officials should eliminate selfishness and guard against excess. Then, by correspondence, the calamities will dissipate, and a hundred blessings will arrive daily.”\n\nZheng possessed the Hu jade tablet and the Rong bow, which had once been lost together to Jing. Jing declared: “You must return the jade tablet and the Rong bow. If not, we will march our troops against you.”\n\nThe lord of Zheng was troubled. He rode to see Kang Cangzi and said: “The Hu jade tablet and Rong bow were inherited from our former lord, who received them from Hu—a treasured heirloom passed down through generations, its brilliance and legacy preserved. Now Jing, relying on its might, demands them, threatening military action if we refuse. Our state is in peril. I wish to send other jade tablets and bows in their place. What do you think?”\n\nKang Cangzi replied: “Your lordship should be at ease. Now, Jing also possesses treasures of its own. Adorn their treasures and offer them to Zheng in apology for their offense. What Jing cannot do, you must achieve with the genuine articles.\n\nJing, through a minor transgression, has overstepped its authority and punishments, indulging in unrighteousness to exhaust and weaken its neighboring states. Jing will lose the support of the feudal lords. When the lords hear of this, they will take warning, strengthen their vigilance, and emulate diligent and enlightened governance. They will convene to uphold righteousness, and Zheng will naturally stand at the forefront. Your lordship should wait—could this not be a blessing?”\n\nThereupon, Zheng sent the Hu jade tablet and Rong bow.\n\nBefore they reached Ying, the people of Jing heard of it and said: “They speak with the words of a sage. How can we accept these, displaying our unrighteousness to the world and giving the feudal lords cause to harbor resentment?” They promptly returned the gifts and grew even more favorably disposed toward Zheng.\n\nHuman nature desires life and abhors death, craves security and shuns peril, seeks honor and avoids disgrace. When people attain their desires, they rejoice; when they rejoice, they are at peace. When they do not attain their desires, they suffer; when they suffer, they are in peril.\n\nIf a ruler indulges his desires, then all officials and commoners will likewise pursue theirs. When all officials and commoners pursue their desires, the people of the world—whether poor or rich—will exhaust their strength or their wealth. The four classes will lose their order, and none will attain their desires.\n\nWhen the people of the world do not attain their desires, they will join hands, cling together, and flee in secret, hiding in remote places, drifting and gathering herbs to preserve their lives. Officials will pursue and capture them, and thus they will be unable to endure their peril and suffering. From this, the thought of banding together and rebelling arises. If such thoughts arise, the state will no longer be the state.\n\nDo not covet a large population—it will scatter the people. Do not strengthen the city walls—it will exhaust the people. If taxes and levies are excessive, the poor will grow poorer daily. If punishments and rewards are inconsistent, the noble will grow nobler daily. If laws and prohibitions are not enforced, the state will collapse.\n\nIf officials lack ability, leniency and severity will be misapplied. Some may compete with the people for profit, giving rise to cunning and deceit. Thus, the people become treacherous and difficult to understand.\n\nWhen the world is difficult to understand, superiors grow suspicious. When superiors grow suspicious, subordinates become more confused. When subordinates are confused, officials toil in vain. When officials toil in vain, rewards fail to encourage, and punishments fail to restrain. The state becomes easily agitated and difficult to pacify—all because officials are not properly chosen.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in carefully selecting men of talent. If a man’s talent and conduct are esteemed in one village, entrust him with the village. If his talent and conduct are esteemed in one district, entrust him with the district. If his talent and conduct are esteemed in one province, entrust him with the province. If his talent and conduct are esteemed throughout the state, entrust him with state governance. Only then can no hidden talent remain concealed.\n\nIf a man is wicked and perverse in his village, admonish him. If he does not reform, he is wicked and perverse—then in the district, flog him. If he still does not reform, he is wicked and perverse—then in the province, banish him.\n\nIf he still does not reform, he is wicked and perverse—then in the state, execute him. Only then can no rebellious conduct arise.\n\nWhen this is truly so, every person under heaven, each with their heart laid bare, will harbor no trace of defiance, disloyalty, arrogance, or indolence—this is called \"pacifying the people.\" Of all the affairs under heaven, none is greater than seeking men of talent. In seeking men of talent, nothing is better than ensuring smooth governance. In ensuring smooth governance, nothing surpasses pacifying the people. The talent for pacifying the people, when assessed by literary composition, may yield only four or five out of a hundred; when assessed by discourse, perhaps one or two in ten; but when assessed by their demeanor—by the serenity of their spirit and the steadiness of their bearing—eight or nine in ten prove sound. Such discernment is the mark of a sagacious king who flourishes in an enlightened age, for only through careful selection can this be achieved.\n\nIn a declining age under a weak ruler, if men of talent are chosen by literary composition, then artful embellishment and excessive ornamentation will proliferate, while true refinement and plain sincerity will recede. If chosen by discourse, then flattery and ostentatious display will abound, while forthright counsel and honest reproof will fade into obscurity. If chosen by demeanor—by the serenity of their spirit and the steadiness of their bearing—then those who appear upright but harbor inner deceit will rise in prominence, while those of pure conduct and clear integrity will remain hidden. In such times, the more \"worthy\" men are promoted, the more governance strays; the more decrees are issued, the more the people descend into chaos.\n\nThe realm is the greatest of vessels; the emperor’s throne, the weightiest of positions. With the right men, order prevails; without them, chaos reigns. The ruler toils in seeking the worthy but finds ease in their employment.\n\nAlas! He who guards heaven’s mandate and gathers the people—how can he not devote himself sincerely to men of talent? The greatest concern of a ruler is the misalignment of human nature, and of all such misalignments, none is more grievous than the miscarriage of justice. When a judge of keen discernment hears a case, he may employ deception to test the truth, wield authority to compel honesty, appeal to emotion to elicit confession, or impose punishment to break resistance. Though his methods may vary, his judgment must always be impartial. Thus, the people of the realm, in life, owe him no undue gratitude, and in death, bear him no resentment.\n\nTo govern a state, establish officials, and administer justice in this manner is to attain the highest office. In such an age, the hearts of the people are harmonious and upright, all livelihoods flourish, love and respect run deep, and the bonds between high and low are firm, unshakable as a single family. How, then, could rebellion or disorder ever arise?\n\nWhen King Ping restored order and settled in the capital, he devoted himself to seeking men of talent. Upon hearing even a single good report, he would rejoice for days. His attendants repeatedly spoke of ministers with exceptional virtue, and this continued for over a year. The king said: \"I, alone, am deficient in virtue and lack discernment. I strive to seek the worthy, yet I fear that hidden talents in the mountains and marshes remain overlooked. How could I take pleasure in hearing good reports only to shut myself off from them? Recently, flattering courtiers have repeatedly praised those in positions of power, gradually gaining influence at my side. My own weakness and dullness have left me unable to judge clearly, so I have merely followed their lead, allowing their influence to grow unchecked. Of all the ways virtue is undermined and morality corrupted, none is greater than this. Had I corrected this sooner, their cliques would not have taken such firm root.\"\n\nThereupon, he executed three of his closest attendants in the marketplace and demoted five high-ranking officials, declaring: \"Let no minister who serves his lord curry favor with subordinates to deceive those above.\" When the realm heard of this, they praised his clarity and wisdom, and seven states from the west of the Southern Sea pledged allegiance.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, carriages and robes are plain and unadorned, laws are lenient and simple, and prohibitions are few and broad. When carriages and robes are plain, people do not covet excess; when laws are lenient and simple, customs are free from taboos; when prohibitions are few and broad, transgressions are easy to avoid. If people do not covet excess, their desires diminish, and they take joy in their work. If customs are free from taboos, emotions flow freely, and joy and harmony prevail. If transgressions are easy to avoid, good and evil are clearly distinguished, and people value virtue and know shame.\n\nTo take joy in one’s work is called \"compliance\"; to share joy and harmony is called \"concord\"; to value virtue and know shame is called \"rectitude.\" The indolent cannot withstand compliance; the rebellious cannot withstand concord; the wicked cannot withstand rectitude. Compliance, concord, and rectitude—these three are the foundation of good governance.\n\nIn a declining age, carriages and robes are ornate and elaborate, laws are convoluted and superstitious, and prohibitions are harsh and obscure. When carriages and robes are ornate, people vie in extravagance; when laws are convoluted, customs brim with taboos; when prohibitions are harsh and obscure, no one knows where to turn. If people vie in extravagance, they abandon integrity and scorn simplicity in favor of ostentation; if customs brim with taboos, emotions are stifled, and high and low grow estranged; if no one knows where to turn, slander and calamity multiply, and the people no longer fear death.\n\nTo scorn simplicity in favor of ostentation is called \"frivolity\"; estrangement between high and low is called \"obstruction\"; the people’s disregard for death is called \"recklessness.\" Men of true integrity will not serve in an age of frivolity; men of impartial honesty will not serve in an age of obstruction; men of ability will not serve in an age of recklessness. Frivolity, obstruction, and recklessness—these three are the ladders to chaos.\n\nKing Xiong Yu of Jing asked Kang Cangzi about the causes of floods, droughts, order, and chaos. Kang Cangzi replied: \"Floods and droughts are matters of heaven; order and chaos are matters of man. If human affairs are harmonious and well-governed, even floods and droughts cannot bring harm—such were the cases of Yao and Tang. Thus, the Zhou’s official records state: 'Man’s strength overcomes heaven.' If human affairs are corrupt and chaotic, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble—how were Jie and Zhou’s downfalls merely the result of floods and droughts?\"\n\nKing Xiong of Jing bowed northward in reverence and, pressing his forehead to the ground, said: \"Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one, for granting me these words.\"\n\nThen he presented ten pairs of grand jades to Kang Cangzi as a birthday gift and appointed him as Vice Minister. The king said: \"Perhaps my state may yet recover?\"\n\nKang Cangzi, unable to refuse, left in the dead of night in plain clothes for another realm.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, mountains harbor no false recluses, markets yield no ill-gotten gains, and courts grant no sycophantic stipends.\n\nThe state’s minister asked: \"How may we restore the people’s simplicity and purity?\"\n\nKang Cangzi replied: \"When governance is oppressive and harsh, people grow cunning and deceitful; when governance is simple and unified, people remain simple and pure. The customs of the people follow the shape of state policy as the inchworm conforms to the leaf—feeding on green, its body turns green; feeding on yellow, its body turns yellow.\"\n\nThe minister asked: \"How may we enrich the people?\"\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"Tax in due season, and let officials be pure and frugal—then the people will prosper. Tax without restraint, and let officials be extravagant and indulgent—then the people will grow poor. The arrow of Gou Yue is tipped with refined gold, its fletching made from the feathers of fierce falcons. Used to strike a clod of earth, it is no different from a crude stick. Yet when loosed from a powerful crossbow to repel bandits and contend for victory, nothing stands against it three hundred paces away. The sword Fei Jing dazzles like the sun at noon, its qi surging in purple arcs. Used to butcher reeds, it is no different from a kitchen knife. Yet when wielded to quell treacherous turmoil and boiling unrest, nothing survives its sweep for a thousand li. Thus, material has its proper place, and use has its proper fit—what matters is to follow the times.\n\nIn ancient times, the Radiant August Emperor governed the world in peace. All things flourished, and the myriad natures reached their fullness—this was the virtue of following the times without disturbance. In recent ages, the world teems with the treacherous and deceitful, while the upright and honest grow few; the frivolous and profit-seeking multiply, while the steadfast and retiring dwindle. The treacherous utter words that drown out loyal speech, causing the people of the world to turn against and harm one another. Alas! Laws should be easy to avoid but hard to violate; remedies for corruption should be simple in affairs and unified in command.\n\nRemove the overbearing and tyrannical, and officials will be at ease. Enforce punishments and prohibitions strictly, and officials will not dare pursue private gain. When officials do not dare pursue private gain, the people will prosper. The *Records of Punishments* state: 'Calamities and disasters may warrant amnesty, but amnesties should not be frequent. Frequent amnesties allow the wicked to scheme, embolden the innocent to entertain malice, and stifle the worthy and good. When a great criminal is captured by officials and, through broad accusations, implicates the loyal and good—dragging in the distant and unrelated in hopes of shifting blame—only to be pardoned in the end, the victims of the crime find no redress, only self-inflicted harm. Thus, the innocent devise cunning schemes in turn, officials toil under harsh governance, and none can quell the chaos—all due to the fault of frequent amnesties.\n\nPeople refrain from acting lawlessly and unjustly because of punishment; they strive to act with Dao and virtue because of reward. Now, if the lawless and unjust are pardoned while the virtuous and just are harmed and go unrewarded, how can we expect people to turn toward goodness? Would it not be difficult indeed?\n\nIf a wise ruler or outstanding scholar were to examine this: when the people resent, it is not for lack of engagement; when the spirits rage, it is not for lack of sacrifice. The more cunning and flattery abound, the more the people resent; the more excessive the sacrifices, the more the spirits rage.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao of the Ruler**\n\nWhat gives life is heaven; what nurtures and completes is man. One who can nurture what heaven has given without encroaching upon things is called the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven’s actions preserve the qi of heaven—this is how officials establish themselves. Officials are established to preserve life. Yet the deluded rulers of today multiply offices only to harm life, losing the very foundation of their establishment.\n\nGrass congested rots; trees congested breed worms; people congested fall ill; states congested see a hundred evils arise, and peril and chaos become uncontrollable. What is meant by a congested state? The ruler’s virtue is not disseminated below, and the people’s desires are not conveyed above. Therefore, sagely kings value loyal ministers and upright scholars, for they dare to speak frankly and dispel blockages.\n\nRestrain the self and return to ritual, and the worthy and good will come of their own accord. When the ruler plows and the queen tends silkworms, the common people transform naturally. Thus, the worthy and good may be awaited but not sought—those obtained by seeking are not truly worthy. The common people may be transformed but not coerced—coercion does not accord with principle.\n\nYao and Shun labored as rulers but had no personal desires, so the world each attained their wishes. They held the position of ruler but not the mind of one, so the world each gave free rein to their hearts. There are scholars loved by all the world but not by their ruler, and those loved by their ruler alone but not by the world. Employ those loved by all the world, and the world will be at peace; employ those loved by the ruler alone, and the world will be in peril. How can a ruler indulge his own likes and dislikes? Thus, one who values the world’s love must restrain his emotions.\n\nWhat is meant by \"the world\"? It is that which contains the ten thousand things. What is meant by \"the state\"? It is that which contains the multitudes. The state takes the people as its root; when the people are at peace, the state is at peace. Therefore, a ruler who worries for the state seeks those capable of ordering the people.\n\nJade is hard to distinguish because of its resemblance to common stone; gold is hard to distinguish because of its resemblance to brass. Now, if one were to cover a quail with the wings of a falcon, the dim-sighted would see only its age—only the clear-sighted would recognize it as a quail. Today, petty men recite classics and medical texts, or study arcane arts and persuasive rhetoric, and are clad in the robes of high office. The foolish see and hear them and take them for gentlemen; the discerning see and hear them and know them as petty men. Thus, a truly enlightened ruler selects people by their words, by their talents, and by their conduct.\"\n\nWhen a ruler lacks discernment, selecting people by their words brings chaos; selecting by their talents brings chaos; selecting by their conduct brings chaos.\n\nA sagely ruler employs people by valuing achievements unseen by the ear, unseen by the eye, and inexpressible in words—yet the people naturally govern themselves in harmony. If a ruler values achievements heard by the ear, then all under heaven will transport goods and chase profit to trade for reputation. If he values achievements seen by the eye, then all under heaven will flaunt strange forms and unusual skills to vie for advancement. If he values achievements that can be spoken of, then all under heaven will practice glib tongues and polished phrases to adorn their words. When all under heaven trade for reputation, vie for advancement, and adorn their words—when those who attain prominence are such men—governance fails.\n\nRulers all know that a mirror clarifies their appearance, yet they detest officials who clarify their faults. A mirror’s clarity serves a minor purpose; an official’s clarity serves a great one. To recognize the small but lose the great is to fail to understand categories.\n\nAlas! If a ruler purifies his mind and reduces affairs, and his ministers are reverent, frugal, and dutiful, great peace will swiftly arrive. Yet some find this difficult—how can I comprehend it? If the ruler’s heart is clouded and indecisive, then the harmony of heaven and earth, the four seas, and all living things—plants and creatures alike—will lose their Dao.\n\nThose who select people by what they hear and see fill offices with many yet bring disorder to governance. Those who select by thoughtful consideration keep offices few and governance clear. Thus, in an age of orderly rule, one seeks talents unseen and unheard; in an age of peril and decline, one seeks talents that can be seen and heard. Alas! Does the ruler understand this?\n\nWhen people are selected by what is heard and seen, they all clamor and scheme to buy reputation. When selected by thoughtful consideration, they all remain composed and upright to cultivate virtue. When officials are composed, upright, and diligent in virtue, transformation occurs without words. When officials clamor and scheme to buy reputation, even punishment fails to instill fear—does the ruler of the age understand this?\n\n**On the Way of Ministers (Chapter Five)**\n\nWhen a state is about to rise, the hundreds of officials in its court may be short or tall, plain or handsome, gentle or stern, correct or flawed. Though their words and appearances seem disparate, when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all are devoted to the state. Thus, they offer forthright admonition without resentment, accept demotion without shock, and debate to reach the mean without violating principle. Therefore, heaven does not err in its seasons, earth does not fail in its benefits, people do not disrupt their duties, spirits and gods lend their favor, barbarians submit in harmony, great unity is preserved, and the ten thousand things transform and nurture.\n\nWhen a state is about to fall, the hundreds of officials in its court have mostly fine appearances, harmonious complexions, refined and gentle speech, and polished movements. Though their appearances and words seem amiable, when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all are bent on competing for position. Thus, they find oddities strange, react with shock to differences, and conceal their envy, ultimately losing the Dao. Therefore, heaven sends disasters in its seasons, earth produces perverse things, people commit wicked deeds, spirits and gods sow misfortune, barbarians invade in waves, calamities and chaos multiply, and the ten thousand things fail to transform.\n\nThose who achieve success and establish governance without wasting resources, exhausting the people, or harming officials—whose merits extend from the common people to enhance the ruler’s virtue—are loyal and worthy ministers. Those who squander wealth, trouble the people, endanger officials for fleeting gains, and seek rewards from the ruler while ignoring future disasters for the state are treacherous ministers.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, offices are filled by the right people. In an age of disorder, people seize offices.\n\nWhen Zhulong Ren Kui asked about serving a ruler, Kang Cangzi said: \"One who pledges his name as a minister should hold nothing in his heart but impartiality, nothing in his demeanor but harmony, and nothing in his words but correctness. Impartiality should not be exposed, harmony should not be adulterated, and correctness should not offend.\"\n\nThe ancients who were pure and diligent in governing the state and reforming policy arranged affairs with order, acted appropriately, and aligned with the greater whole. Those today who are pure and diligent cultivate their reputations. They arrange affairs with order, but their reach is obstructed, and they are constrained by minor details.\n\nThus, when the heart takes the Dao as its master, even in handling matters, things find their proper place. When the heart takes matters as its master, even in handling things, they lose their proper place.\n\nA minister in high office who does not admonish, or in low office who is not impartial, does not deserve his salary. When a ruler is not solemn and respectful, and high ministers do not display trustworthiness to their subordinates, ministers do not fit their positions in court.\n\nA talented person is not necessarily loyal; a loyal person is not necessarily talented. Ministers do not fear disloyalty but worry that their utmost loyalty will not be trusted. Rulers do not fear distrust but worry that their trust will not be matched by capable service.\n\nThe highest type of person, when their nature is realized, brings order to all under heaven. The middling type, when their nature is realized, brings chaos to all under heaven. A wise ruler employs the highest type, entrusting them with discretion to act freely as they see fit. When employing the middling type, he must set standards for their achievements and make rewards and punishments clear.\n\n**On the Way of the Worthy (Chapter Six)**\n\nThe worthy are frequently sought yet rarely arrive, difficult to advance and easy to retreat—not because they cherish their lives and refuse to die for the ruler’s affairs, but because they fear their utmost loyalty will not be trusted.\n\nThose who know themselves to be capable and insightful are outwardly respectful yet inwardly untroubled. Among the crowd, they are harmonious and upright without familiarity. Draw near, and they become even more solemn; distance yourself, and they withdraw without resentment. In hardship, they accept fate with ease; in prosperity, they correct themselves with the Dao.\n\nSome appear worthy in their bearing, sound worthy in their voice, yet when their spirit is tested and their knowledge examined, they fall short of expectations. When the worthy are employed, they offer subtle counsel in court and remain silent abroad, diligently attending to their duties, living simply and leisurely at home. When not employed, they conceal themselves among the crowd, hide their insight from view, restrain their words, eat their fill, walk at ease, cultivate their own integrity, and remain steadfast without resentment.\n\nThe wise do not doubt the Dao, the perceptive do not doubt others. Those of discernment walk through peril yet their countenance remains unruffled; their words are modest yet their principles unshakable. Truly, the worthy do not call themselves worthy—their efficacy lies in governance, their merit in every task.\n\nIn times of great peace, the highest scholars apply their insight, the middling exhaust their endurance, and the petty offer their strength. In Qi there was a man named Pouzi, whose talents could have revitalized the state, whose conduct could have stood alone. He served his parents with filial reverence, and in his village he was respectful and compliant. Yet dwelling in poverty with nothing to provide for them, he practiced trust and righteousness and wandered for a long time. Why did he find so few in accord?\n\nSome, riding the tide of the times, flattered and fawned, and he was mocked and deceived by them. Thus, staff in hand and on foot, he went to consult Kangcangzi, saying: \"I have heard that the perfected forget emotion, while the common people do not manage their affairs with emotion. Those who retain emotion devote themselves to teaching and esteem trust and righteousness. Yet now I do not know how to act: should I accept distrust as trust, or trust that is not trusted as trust? Should I toil in admiration of righteousness as righteousness, or be deemed righteous without awaiting righteousness? If so, then those who uphold trust and righteousness are ever alone in hardship and retreat—how then can they be valued by the times, or elevated by the principles of teaching?\"\n\nKangcangzi lowered his head and stroked his beard, then looked up and sighed. Suddenly he burst into song: \"When the times are bright, trust and righteousness flourish; when the times are silent, trust and righteousness lie hidden. Brightness and silence, flourishing and concealment—why should I favor one over the other? Swiftly they shift, and I cannot grasp their meaning.\"\n\nTo align one’s true nature with the Way and yet find no response in things—this is true inaction.\n\nWhen the true and unobstructed Way is no longer practiced, it is called the loss of the Dao. In times of Dao’s loss, the superior person retreats—this is the meaning of concealment. There are those whose actions may be observed, yet none can act as they do; there are those who may be employed, yet when the state follows the Dao, they appear wise, and when the state strays from the Dao, they appear foolish. Thus, none can truly employ them.\n\nDuke Ji asked: \"From where do worthy talents arise?\"\nKangcangzi replied: \"The truly virtuous may be awaited but not sought; talent must be sought with care, for carelessness yields none. If the Son of Heaven is serene, his great ministers enlightened, punishments do not spare the noble, and favor does not exclude the lowly, then worthy men will come of their own accord seeking employment. When worthy men are employed, all within the four seas will see with clarity, hear with purity, and hold their hearts open without oppression. Heaven will perfect itself, earth will settle, the myriad things will mature in harmony, and even spirits will be powerless to intervene. Thus, the truly virtuous may be awaited but not sought.\n\nIf the Son of Heaven is diligent and his great ministers seek talent with harmonious governance, then magnanimous, upright, and steadfast men will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is harsh and exacting, and his great ministers seek talent with impatience, then cunning, obsequious men who distort principles will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is suspicious and jealous, and his great ministers seek talent with flattery, then those with strange names and bizarre arts will arrive. If the Son of Heaven deems himself wise, and his great ministers cling to their positions, then men who chase reputation with empty words and corrupt, frivolous displays will arrive. If the Son of Heaven wavers, and his great ministers resort to deceit, then men who feign loyalty while harboring malice, whose words are gentle but hearts venomous, will arrive. Thus, talent must be sought with care, for carelessness yields none.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained Changxian, Feng Hong, Rong Qiu, and Shang Tang gained Yi Yin; the revival of the Zhou saw Fu Shen; Duke Huan of Qi found Ning Ji—all because these rulers embodied the Dao, surpassed in benevolence, displayed sagely martial virtue, sought harmony and brilliance, and governed with magnanimity and uprightness. Thus, the worthy came of their own accord seeking employment, not through rigid selection.\n\nDuke Ji asked: \"You say the worthy do not seek but come of their own accord—are there also the unworthy who do not seek but come of their own accord?\"\nKangcangzi replied: \"Indeed, the unworthy who do not seek but come of their own accord are many. When the world follows the Dao, the worthy do not seek but come of their own accord; when the world strays from the Dao, the unworthy do not seek but come of their own accord. Rulers who follow the Dao are few, while those who stray are many; the worthy are few, while the unworthy are many. Thus, the unworthy who do not seek but come of their own accord are many.\"\n\nDuke Ji asked: \"The worthy surely save the world, and talent can also save the world—if both save the world, how do the worthy and the talented differ?\"\nKangcangzi replied: \"Your question is pressing! When deeds are accomplished and tasks completed, to refuse titles and renown, to withdraw with humility and frugality—this is the mark of the worthy. When deeds are accomplished and tasks completed, to bask in emoluments and praise, to exult in full ambition—this is the mark of talent. The worthy can stabilize a state; talent can govern a state. By 'stabilize,' I mean harmonizing and pacifying through non-action, so that none perceive their effort. By 'govern,' I mean diligently managing affairs, so that all recognize their virtue. One worthy can lead a multitude of talents with ease, but a multitude of talents cannot measure up to one worthy—such is the distinction between the worthy and the talented.\n\nThere are those who dwell in mountains and forests yet clamor, and those who live amidst worldly customs yet remain still. There are those who clamor yet remain upright, and those who are still yet harbor wickedness. Generally, when one observes their coarse and vulgar appearance, finding a truly worthy man among them is as rare as one in ten thousand. Yet when one observes their refined and elegant appearance, discovering they are petty men occurs nine times out of ten. To discern their refinement without scrutinizing their words, to assess their bearing without demanding their demeanor, to recognize their goodness without heeding their praise, and to judge their truth without being swayed by slander—this is the mark of true discernment.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: Following the Dao**\n\nMin Ziqian asked Confucius: \"How do the Dao and filial piety differ?\"\nConfucius replied: \"The Dao is the wondrous function of nature. Filial piety is the supreme virtue of human relations. It encompasses and moves heaven and earth, nurtures the myriad things, shapes all forms, and bestows nature and longevity. Its merit is most substantial, yet it does not serve as a storehouse for things, nor as an office for affairs. It does not claim credit for its achievements, and though one may seek it through touch, sight, or hearing, none can possess it. It is called the Dao. When applied to humanity, it is called filial piety.\n\nFilial piety is the name for serving one’s parents well. In serving one’s parents well, reverence and compliance are fundamental. One’s intentions should align with theirs, one’s compliance should match their countenance, and nothing should be left undone. In uttering a word or forming an intention, one must not dare to forget one’s parents. In moving a hand or lifting a foot, one must not dare to forget one’s parents. In serving one’s lord, one must not dare to be disloyal; with friends, one must not dare to be untrustworthy; toward subordinates, one must not dare to be disrespectful; in pursuing goodness, one must not dare to be idle. Even in the solitude of one’s chamber, one must not dare to relax one’s sincerity—this is called perfect filial piety.\n\nThus, the utmost sincerity of filial piety reaches the spirits and shines across the four seas. It elicits a response to every feeling—this is the result of serving one’s parents well. Of old, Shun was most filial. Though his stepmother deceived his father, who repeatedly sought to harm him, Shun’s heart grew only more reverent, his fear deepened, yet he bore no resentment. When they schemed to have him dredge a well, and earth was piled upon him, heaven’s favor shook the spirits, and he emerged from a side tunnel. His devotion in serving them grew ever more meticulous, and thus his dark virtue flourished, making him lord of the world—this was the result of serving his parents well.\n\nWhen King Wen was crown prince, he was most filial. Morning and evening, he would go to the outer gate of his father’s chamber and ask the attendants: 'How is he today? How does he fare?' If told he was well, the crown prince’s face would brighten with joy. If his condition was even slightly unstable, the crown prince’s countenance would fill with worry. When meals were presented, he would first check their temperature, and after they were served, he would inquire about the dishes offered before withdrawing.\"\n\nWhen the attendants reported illness, the crown prince would solemnly don his cap and fast. He would respectfully inspect the dishes prepared by the royal chefs, and personally taste the medicinal broths offered. If the food was good, the crown prince could eat; if the food was poor, he could not eat his fill. Only when his father’s condition returned to normal would his own appetite return to normal.\n\nWhen the lord had faults, he would gently admonish with a soothing voice. Even for small things the lord cherished, he would treat them with utmost reverence. Thus, filial piety perfected his person, and the Dao harmonized the world.\n\nThe *Ya* states: \"King Wen ascended and descended, ever at the Lord’s side,\" meaning that in King Wen’s stillness and action, advance and retreat, Heaven must have aided him—thus Zhou could not harm him. His dream foretold a long life, divination thirty generations, seven hundred years—all Heaven’s mandate, the result of serving his parents well.\n\nMin Ziqian asked: \"I have been fortunate to learn the way of serving parents well. May I ask about the principles of teaching children?\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"The Three Kings in teaching their children always observed ritual and music. Music cultivates the inner self, ritual cultivates the outer. When ritual and music are cultivated together, virtue and bearing shine forth in one’s appearance, enabling one to be warmly respectful and civilized.\n\nNow, if a minister would sacrifice his life for his lord’s benefit, how much more should he benefit himself to serve his lord well? Thus, they selected loyal, upright, and steadfast scholars as teachers and transmitters, desiring them to understand the Dao of father and son, lord and minister, elder and younger.\n\nOnly when one knows how to be a son can one be a father; only when one knows how to be a minister can one be a lord; only when one knows how to serve others can one employ others. These are the principles by which the Three Kings taught their children.\"\n\nMin Ziqian withdrew and practiced these principles at home. For three years, no one could find fault with his words toward his parents or brothers. His companions praised his trustworthiness, his village praised his benevolence, his clan praised his fraternal duty. The reputation of his virtuous conduct spread throughout the world—this was the result of serving his parents well.\n\nThe crown prince of Qi sat upon the Clear Terrace. Yan Zhuanghou Tuo approached, wearing a tall cap and stern expression, a jade-hilted sword at his left, pendants at his right, their radiance illuminating left and right. The crown prince, reading a book, did not look up. Zhuanghou Tuo asked: \"Does Qi possess treasures?\"\n\nThe crown prince replied: \"A lord who is trustworthy and ministers who are loyal, with the people supporting their superiors—these are Qi’s treasures.\"\n\nZhuanghou Tuo immediately unbuckled his sword and departed.\n\nAlas! Can a person have biases and remain unaware of them for a lifetime? The worthy see them but forgive and do not speak; petty men, in their reckless affection, speak excessively; relatives, in their pity and envy, sow discord.\n\nHow can one with biases not know them? Thus, the noble person examines himself as if he always has faults. Wearing his clothes, eating his food, knowing his faults yet unable to correct them—this the noble person considers shameful. When about to speak, if he knows his words cannot be put into practice, the noble person seldom speaks.\n\nWhen reproaching others’ faults, does one examine one’s own goodness? When reproaching others’ errors, does one examine one’s own rectitude? This is called \"turning the mirror inward.\"\n\nThe son of Di Xi was most filial and cautious. Di Xi, pitying his son, often spoke recklessly to him. When Di Xi left in the morning and returned in the evening, he would say: \"So-and-so has died.\" His son believed him, yet later found the person alive. Another evening, he would say: \"So-and-so is about to harm you.\" His son watched for the man to take revenge, yet saw no ill intent. Another evening, he would say: \"So-and-so is ill.\" His son observed him, yet the man was in good health. Such instances accumulated over the years.\n\nThe son remained filial and cautious, but in matters of instruction and discipline, he could no longer trust or obey. The people of his village and state detested his father’s reckless speech and plotted to kill him. Di Xi, hearing this, grew fearful and returned to tell his son. The son did not fully believe him, yet soon after, Di Xi was killed.\n\nThose who speak excessively are called careless and indiscreet, yet some are sparing in words but not discreet. Those who are frivolous are called unstable, yet some have composed demeanors but restless hearts. Those who are meddlesome are called petty, yet some appear pure outwardly but are impure within. Such types, when categorized and enumerated, cannot all be recorded. Without thorough understanding, who can fully investigate and discern them?\n\nThere are times when one cannot but respond—within, one is still, yet without, one acts, easily moved but difficult to calm. There are times when one cannot but seek—within, one reflects, yet without, one waits; only when the time comes does one rejoice.\n\nThus, those who are still outwardly but restless inwardly harm their nature through agitated thoughts. Those who chase profit through constant activity exhaust their strength and damage their reputation.\n\nSome in the world may not achieve their aspirations and claim they have not met their time—this is no different from bearing the guilt of a crimson neck, awaiting execution when the time comes. Is this not perilous?\n\nThose with vast talent and broad understanding who are not recognized or employed may rightly say the times are not unclean, but their fate has not aligned—is this not correct?\n\nThose skilled in remonstrance strive to preserve the nature of those they advise and prune the emotions from which faults arise, thus fostering mutual advancement and deepening respect and affection. Those unskilled in remonstrance attack the nature of those they advise and are blind to the origins of emotions, thus breeding mutual suspicion and resentment day by day.\n\nWhat children find simple, the elderly may reject; what pleases the eyes and ears may trouble the mind.\n\nThose who harshly reproach the world’s foolishness are themselves not wise; those who harshly reproach the world’s delusion are themselves not enlightened. Reproaching the multitude’s foolishness while oneself is unwise leads to ruin; reproaching the multitude’s delusion while oneself is unenlightened leads to harm.\n\n**Agricultural Dao, Chapter Eight**\n\nWhen people abandon fundamentals and pursue secondary matters, their commands are not unified. Without unified commands, they cannot defend or fight. When people abandon fundamentals and pursue secondary matters, production dwindles and resources are scarce. With scarce production, they lightly abandon their homes, and with frequent migration, the state suffers constant disasters.\n\n**Agricultural Dao, Chapter Eight (continued)**\n\nAll cultivate distant aspirations, none settle their minds. When people abandon fundamentals and pursue secondary matters, they delight in cunning; delighting in cunning breeds deceit, and deceit leads to manipulating laws and decrees. Manipulating laws and decrees inverts right and wrong.\n\nThe way ancient sage-kings governed the people was to prioritize agriculture. Farmers do not merely seek profit—they value the fulfillment of their aspirations. When people engage in agriculture, they become simple; simplicity makes them easy to employ, and ease of employment secures the borders, which in turn elevates the ruler’s standing. When people engage in agriculture, they become honest; honesty reduces self-interest, and reduced self-interest establishes public law.\n\nExerting strength in deep plowing increases production; increased production makes migration burdensome, and reluctance to migrate ensures unwavering resolve—thus the world’s qi unifies in a single heart. When the world is of one heart, even the governance of the Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor would not surpass it.\n\nThe reason ancient sage-kings vigorously promoted plowing and weaving was to establish them as foundational teachings. Thus, the Son of Heaven personally led the feudal lords in plowing the sacred field, while officials of all ranks were ranked by merit to encourage respect for production. The queen and concubines led the palace women in silkworm rearing at the suburban altars, tending mulberry fields to urge diligent labor—a model of feminine virtue.\n\nMen do not weave yet are clothed; women do not plow yet are fed. Through the exchange of labor between men and women, each sustains the other’s livelihood—this was the system of the sage-kings. Thus, they revered the seasons and cherished the days, assessed yields and evaluated work, resting only in old age or illness. The toil of one sustains ten. During the farming season, earthworks were not initiated, nor were troops mobilized; men did not leave their posts, nor were women married away, so as not to disrupt agriculture.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"The four seasons cannot be forced—only the five grains can be properly cultivated.\" Cultivation depends on human effort, growth on Heaven, and nourishment on earth. Thus, when plowing, leave room for the foot; when hoeing, leave room for the hand; when weeding, leave room for the fingers—this is the Dao of farming.\n\nFarmers produce food, artisans craft tools, merchants trade goods. If the seasons are not honored and earthworks are imposed, it is a great misfortune. Early crops must precede the season; late crops must not lag behind it. If cold and heat are unbalanced, crops suffer many disasters.\n\nFifty-seven days after the winter solstice, yang begins to grow—this is when plowing commences. The Dao of farming is this: see life and sow, see death and reap. Heaven sends the seasons, earth yields resources—these do not await human timing. In years of plenty, sacrifice to the earth; in years of scarcity, still do not miss the proper time. Begin when the season arrives, cease when it passes, and even the old and weak can be fully employed.\n\nThose who do not understand the seasons act prematurely or lag behind, neglecting the proper time—this is the lowest form of farming. Plowing must be done early to ensure fertile soil and loose earth. Crops thrive in fine soil and firm ground; carefully select seeds, neither too dense nor too sparse. When applying soil, neither stint nor overdo it. Furrows should be deep and straight, ridges fertile and level. Below, they receive shade; above, sunlight—then all will grow.\n\nSeedlings planted in rows mature quickly; strong and weak do not harm each other, so they grow swiftly. Straighten the rows, clear the center, and allow qi and cool breezes to circulate—then there will be harvests and abundant yields. Crops that appear lush from afar but sparse up close are stolen by the earth. If left unweeded, they become overgrown; if over-weeded, they wither—both cause harm.\n\nYoung seedlings prefer solitude; mature plants prefer companionship; ripe crops prefer mutual support. When these three thrive together, the harvest is abundant. If seedlings do not sprout and die together, the early ones yield fine grain, while the late ones become chaff. Thus, when thinning, keep the elder and remove the younger.\n\nDo not let plants in fertile soil grow too luxuriantly; do not let plants in barren soil grow alone. Luxuriant growth in fertile soil produces much chaff; solitary growth in barren soil leads to many deaths. Those who do not understand thinning remove the elder and nurture the younger, discarding the grain and keeping the chaff. If above and below are unsettled, crops die in great numbers.\n\nTimely millet grows tall with large ears, round grains with thin husks, sweet and fragrant rice that is easy to hull and hearty to eat. Untimely millet has deep awns, slender stalks, sharp ears, much chaff, and withered leaves.\n\nTimely millet has long, awnless ears, plump grains, and little husk. Untimely millet has thick stalks, flowering stems, greasy leaves, and short ears.\n\nTimely rice has long, dense stalks and ears like horse tails. Untimely rice has slender, weak stalks, thick husks, and withers prematurely.\n\nTimely hemp has sparse nodes, bright color, sturdy fibers, and small roots. Untimely hemp has dense branches, short stalks, rough nodes, and worm-eaten leaves.\n\nTimely beans have long stalks and short roots, pods in clusters of fourteen, many branches, numerous nodes, lush leaves, and heavy, satisfying seeds. Untimely beans grow long vines, floating leaves, weak roots, sparse nodes, and small pods.\n\nTimely wheat has long stalks with clustered necks, grains arranged in rows of fourteen, thin husks, and a golden-yellow color; eating it makes one robust and strong. Untimely wheat is swollen and diseased, with weak seedlings and sparse ears.\n\nThus, timely crops are abundant; untimely crops are meager. All grains are suitable when properly cultivated, and eating them strengthens the four limbs, sharpens hearing and vision, repels malign qi, and prevents ailments. How excellent is Confucius’ saying: \"In winter, a full stomach warms the body; in summer, it cools it.\" When warmth and coolness are seasonally appropriate, people suffer no illnesses.\n\nWhen people suffer no illnesses, epidemics do not spread; when epidemics do not spread, all may fulfill their natural lifespans. Thus it is said: \"Grain is the heaven of man.\" Therefore, enlightened rulers prioritize agriculture; a ruler who neglects agriculture abandons his people. And a ruler who abandons his people—what kind of state can he govern?\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Dao of Warfare**\n\nKing Jing of Qin sought military supremacy across the realm, dispatching envoys to every corner to summon Kàngcāngzǐ, offering him twelve walled cities and pressing him urgently. When Kàngcāngzǐ arrived, he was lodged in the upper guesthouse with honors drawn from Róngquán.\n\nFor three days, King Jing could not pose his question. Rising from his mat, he turned northward, prostrated himself, and struck his jade tablet to the ground, saying: \"Does Heaven truly have no intention of aiding this lonely one?\"\n\nKàngcāngzǐ, his gaze softening with a faint smile, replied: \"I deemed Your Majesty’s bearing extraordinary—why trouble yourself with such wearisome inquiry? Though one’s qi may be blunted by cutting or stabbing, the suppressed will naturally rise to rectitude. There is no alternative.\"\n\nKing Jing bowed twice, straightened his embroidered robe, adjusted his jade tablet, and lowered his head in deference, saying: \"This is indeed Heaven’s decree.\"\n\nKàngcāngzǐ looked upward in prayer, exhaled slowly, then composed his expression and spoke: \"The origins of warfare arise with man. All warfare is the manifestation of human power. This power is innate, bestowed by Heaven—thus the roots of warfare reach far into antiquity. Even for the briefest moment, it cannot be set aside: noble and base, young and old, wise and foolish all partake in it alike.\n\nObserve the omens of war: when resentment smolders in the heart yet remains unexpressed, that is war; when one glares fiercely and flushes with anger, that is war; when arrogant words are met with forceful rebuttal, that is war; when boastful combat erupts, that is war. These four are conflicts great and small.\n\nBefore the age of Chīyóu, men already wielded wooden clubs to fight. The Yellow Emperor employed water and fire; Gònggōng sowed chaos; the Five Emperors contended with one another—each rise and fall saw the victor prevail. If one dies from swallowing medicine, should all physicians be banned? If one drowns in a boat, should all ships be forbidden? If a state is lost through warfare, should all arms be abolished? Warfare cannot be abolished—it is like water and fire: wielded well, it brings fortune; wielded poorly, it brings disaster.\n\nThus, anger and punishment cannot be abolished in the household; penal laws cannot be abolished in the state; military campaigns cannot be abolished in the world. The sage-kings of antiquity had righteous armies but no abolition of arms. When arms are truly righteous, they punish tyrannical rulers and relieve the suffering of the people. The people rejoice as a filial child beholds a loving parent, as a starving servant encounters a feast. They rush forward with cries, swift as a powerful crossbow loosed into a deep valley.\n\nVictory or defeat need not be sought elsewhere—it must return to human nature. All desire life and shun death, seek honor and avoid disgrace. When the path of life and death, honor and disgrace is unified, the three armies can be made of one mind. An army desires numbers, but even more, it desires unity of heart. When the three armies are of one mind, commands can render them invincible.\n\nThe supreme army values its commands: where its orders are strong, its enemy is weak; where its orders are trustworthy, its enemy yields. Victory secured here ensures victory there. If this is so, how can any enemy prevail?\n\nWhen the enemy advances, it seeks gain. If it arrives only to meet death, then retreat becomes its advantage. If all enemies see retreat as advantageous, blades will never clash—this is the supreme army.\n\nArrogance, cruelty, deceit, and righteous principle stand in opposition; their forces cannot both triumph, nor can they coexist. Thus, when a righteous army enters enemy territory, the people know whom to shelter. When it reaches the outskirts of cities and towns, it does not trample crops, desecrate graves, plunder stores, or burn homes. Captives are treated generously and sent home.\n\nTrust is pledged to the people, enemy resources are seized, good and evil are made clear, and defiance or compliance is demonstrated. If, despite this, there remain those who stubbornly defy, arrogantly resist, and persist in rebellion, then military action may be taken.\n\nFirst, a proclamation is issued: 'Our army comes to avenge the people’s wrongs and align with Heaven’s Dao. Thus, when we conquer a state, we do not massacre its people—we punish only the guilty.' Then, worthy scholars and virtuous men are selected and honored; the lonely, sick, and elderly are sought out and rescued. Treasury wealth is distributed, granary grain is scattered, no goods are hoarded, and courtesy is extended without partiality.\n\nIf a man here could grant life or death to one person, all under Heaven would vie to serve him. A righteous army grants life to many—who would not rejoice? Thus, when a righteous army arrives, the people of neighboring states flock to it like flowing water, and the people of the condemned state look to it as to parents.\n\nThe farther it marches, the more people it gains. Its words had not yet ended when King Jing rose, prostrated himself, and said: 'This lonely one has received the Master’s teachings and feels his qi fill the cosmos, his will now knowing its direction. My heart swells with reverence.'\n\nHe stepped forward, raised a goblet, and toasted Kàngcāngzǐ’s longevity. He bowed, placing him at the head of the ranks of his teachers, and prepared a solemn chamber for him. A month passed, then ten days, and at the hour of Tiānguān, he walked the Way in broad daylight.\n\n*The Scripture of the Penetrating Spirit* concludes.\n\nExcess of talent is not as good as timely appropriateness. To know Heaven’s patterns is not as good as conforming to them; to conform to them is not as good as delighting in them. When the myriad things are full, drought follows. Thus, the sage does not act, yet nothing is left undone. If one doubts this, observe the superior person: when perversity arises in his demeanor, he corrects it; if he does not, this is called evil.\n\nTo follow the natural order is to be upright; to establish offices is to be orderly. To love the people is to be benevolent; to employ their abilities is to be wise. The great man, how could he not know this? Thus, when the state is well-governed, he displays wisdom; when the state is in chaos, he feigns foolishness. Therefore, though he may not reach such heights, in ancient times, when Yao yielded to Shun, the world turned toward virtue of its own accord. When Shun yielded to Yu, the people followed without coercion. When Jie and Zhou were slain, the people rejoiced. When Tang and Wu took the throne, the people submitted.\n\nThose who delight in knowledge bring harm to their persons; those who act recklessly exhaust their strength. The silkworm spins its thread until its body is spent; the craftsman labors with his hands until his years are worn. The mouth and throat become the tombs of the five flavors; the body and qi are consumed by excess. When arrogance and indulgence prevail, even the most reverent cannot save the state.",

During the Tianbao era of the Tang, it was designated as one of the Four Authentic Scriptures of Daoism. Originally in three scrolls, later consolidated into one. Base text sourced from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Section of Penetrating Spirit*, *Category of Original Texts*.

He had partially attained the Dao of Laozi and dwelled on Mount Weilei. Those among his ministers who were ostentatiously wise departed from him; those among his concubines who were fastidiously benevolent distanced themselves. Only the coarse and the toiling remained, serving him with simplicity. After three years, Weilei flourished greatly.\n\nLater, he traveled to Wu and concealed himself on Meng Peak in Piling, where he perfected the Dao and ascended as an immortal. Subsequently, the Han dynasty Master Zhang Tianshi (Fu Guang) and the Tang dynasty Zhang Guolao successively secluded themselves there for cultivation, and the site became known as Zhang Gong’s Altar of Blessed Land. An ancient temple, the Dongling Abbey, was built, later renamed the Tianshen Wanshou Palace during the Song dynasty.\n\nHe authored nine chapters, titled *Geng Sangzi*, also known as *Kang Cangzi*.

The locals whispered among themselves: \"When Kang Cangzi first arrived, we thought him strange, but now our daily reckoning falls short while our yearly harvest overflows. Could he be a sage? Why not together honor him as an ancestral spirit, worship him as a tutelary deity of the soil and grain?\"\n\nKang Cangzi, hearing this, bore an expression of disquiet. His disciple Yan Chuai approached and inquired, to which Kang Cangzi replied: \"I have heard that the perfected one dwells in a humble abode, yet the people roam wildly, unaware of his comings and goings.

This is why I cannot dismiss the words of Lao Dan.\"\n\nYan Chuai said: \"Otherwise, consider this: in a shallow puddle, even a great fish cannot turn its body, and so the newt and loach rule over it; on a hillock of a few paces, even a mighty beast cannot conceal itself, and so the wretched fox and its ilk become omens.

      "translated_text": "The beast of the enclosed chariot, armored yet parted from the mountains, is ensnared by nets and snares; the fish that could swallow a boat, adrift and bereft of water, is tormented by ants and mole-crickets. Thus birds and beasts dwell where they desire the heights, fish and turtles where they desire the depths. For those who preserve their form and life, concealing themselves is nothing more than seeking the deepest obscurity.\n\nI speak to you of the root of great disorder, which began in the time of Yao and Shun, and will endure to the end of ages. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.\n\nBefore the words were finished, Nan Zirong’s expression shifted, and he abruptly rose from his mat, saying: \"I have long followed the cycles of years—how then shall I entrust my life to this teaching?\"\n\nKang Cangzi replied: \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts race restlessly. If you follow this thread of years, perhaps you may yet reach this truth. Though my talent is small and insufficient to transform you, why not journey south to seek my master, Dan?\"\n\nAfter Kang Cangzi declined Zirong’s offer, he did not abandon the customs of Yu, yet the world had already become like a dragon soaring in the heavens.\n\nWater by nature desires clarity, but earth muddies it, so it cannot remain clear. Man by nature desires longevity, but things muddy it, so he cannot attain it. Things exist to nourish our nature, yet the deluded of this age often use their nature to nourish things, failing to distinguish weight from lightness. Thus the sage, in matters of sound, color, and flavor, takes what benefits his nature and discards what harms it—this is the Way of preserving one’s nature.\n\nA thousand men draw their bows, all arrows aimed at a single target—none will miss. The myriad things flourish, yet their flourishing harms the one life—none will escape injury. Therefore, the sage’s regulation of the myriad things preserves their Heaven. When Heaven is preserved, the spirit is preserved. The man of whole spirit acts without deliberation yet penetrates all, plans without scheming yet attains what is fitting. His essence illuminates without bound, his will congeals with the cosmos, his virtue descends like Heaven itself. Whether above as Son of Heaven or below as a common man, he remains unarrogant and unpresumptuous—such is the man of the whole Way.\n\nA mind level and upright, undisturbed by external things, is called pure. Purity enduring becomes clarity; clarity enduring becomes emptiness. In emptiness, the Dao is whole and dwells within.\n\nWhen Qin Yi died, Kang Cangzi wept for him. His servant said: \"The whole world dies—why do you weep, Master?\"\n\nKang Cangzi replied: \"If the whole world weeps, how can I not weep?\"\n\nThe servant said: \"Those who weep must grieve, yet you show no grief—why?\"\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"In all beneath Heaven, I have none with whom to rejoice—where then shall I find grief?\"",

Viscount Sun privately asked: \"Does your state have a sage? Do you know of him?\" The grandee of Chen replied: \"How can one clearly prove his sagacity?\" Viscount Sun said: \"He can set aside the mind and employ the body.\" The grandee of Chen said: \"Our humble state is small, yet it too has a sage, one different from what you have heard. Who is this sage?\" Viscount Sun asked. The grandee of Chen replied: \"There is one called Kang Cangzi, who has fully attained the Dao of Lao Dan. He can use his ears to see and his eyes to hear.\"\n\nDuke Ding heard of this and found it extraordinary. He sent the Viscount Sun to return the visit and to invite Kang Cangzi, receiving him with the rites due to a high minister. Kang Cangzi arrived and was lodged in the secondary guest quarters. The Duke of Lu spoke humbly to inquire of him. Kang Cangzi said: \"I can hear and see without using ears and eyes—not that I reverse the functions of ears and eyes, but the one who reported this was mistaken.\"\n\nThe Duke said: \"How can this be? You increase my wonder. What is the nature of your Dao? I truly wish to hear of it.\" Kang Cangzi said: \"My body unites with my mind, my mind unites with my qi, my qi unites with my spirit, my spirit unites with nothingness. With this resolute presence and resonant tone, though distant as the farthest reaches beyond the eight wilds or near as the space between my brows, whatever comes to engage me, I know it completely—yet I do not know that I know. What my seven orifices, hands, and feet perceive, what my six bowels, five viscera, and heart-mind apprehend, is known only to myself.\"\n\n**Using the Dao, Chapter Two**\n\nHeaven cannot be trusted; falling cannot be trusted; people cannot be trusted; the heart cannot be trusted. Only the Dao can be trusted. How can worthy rulers and outstanding scholars be known?\n\nIn ancient times, Jie trusted Heaven and his ancestral dominion over the Four Seas, yet he did not diligently follow the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Yin. Zhou also trusted Heaven and his ancestral dominion over the Four Seas, yet he did not personally cultivate the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Zhou.\n\nNow, the farmer trusts that falling brings forth the hundred grains, yet if he does not exert himself in the Dao, falling will steal his harvest and leave it overgrown and desolate. The Marquis of Qi trusted human nature’s propensity for yielding and deference, yet he did not understand the Dao. He handed over his entire realm to others, and those others, like owls and jackals, seized his state.\n\nGenerally, if one does not cultivate the Dao but follows the heart and takes it as teacher, indulging desires and luxuriating in excess, disasters, illnesses, and conflicts will arise, harming the body and shortening life. The heart is the source of this harm. Thus it is said: only the Dao can be trusted.\n\nHeaven and falling, without the Dao, cannot endure long; the common people, without worthies, cannot be pacified and compliant; government affairs, without talent, cannot be harmonized and ordered.\n\nThose who employ the Dao do not display their use of it. Blessings flourish and nourish the myriad things, yet no credit is claimed. Spirit merges and undertakings prosper; numinous blessings endure long.\n\nKnowing and distinguishing is called discernment; knowing and not distinguishing is called the Dao. Discernment is for governing people; the Dao is for pacifying people.\n\nThe rooster crows at dawn and labors under the sun, sweat dripping to the ground. At midnight, he barely rests—this is the Dao of the farmer. Stooping to gather, reaching to take, sharpening the mind and concentrating effort, striving with all one’s strength and essence to seek profit—this is the Dao of the merchant. Ingesting qi and refining the spirit, restraining thoughts and reducing concerns, transcending and lightly ascending, refining the essence of the sun to become an immortal—this is the Dao of the lofty scholar. Cutting off emotions and focusing intentions, dedicating oneself wholly to one’s duties, deliberating and measuring while forgetting sleep—this is the Dao of the minister. Purifying the mind and reducing thoughts, examining and verifying close attendants, diligently seeking talented and good men to pacify the myriad people—this is the Dao of the ruler.\n\nIf one follows these categories, each in accord with its measure and intent, not abandoning or obstructing their respective paths, this is called the world having the Dao.\n\nGuiding the sinews and bones preserves the wholeness of form; pruning emotions and desires preserves the wholeness of spirit; quieting speech preserves the wholeness of fortune. Perfecting these three wholenesses is called pure worthiness.\n\nWhen the Dao and virtue flourish, ghosts and spirits assist; when trust and integrity are sincere, noble persons gather; when ritual and propriety are complete, petty persons submit.\n\nThose with discernment are self-assured; those without discernment are also self-assured. Those with the Dao are tranquil and silent; the dull and obtuse are also tranquil and silent.\n\nThings inherently have what seems right but is wrong, seems wrong but is right. Some weep first and laugh later; some begin auspiciously and end inauspiciously. Some bodies can be drawn close, yet their talents are unworthy of closeness; some talents command respect, yet their bodies are unworthy of respect. Excessive respect precludes intimacy; excessive intimacy precludes respect. Drawing close may lead to estrangement; keeping distance may lead to closeness.\n\nExcessive kindness breeds resentment; excessive love invites hatred. Some value speed; some value slowness; some value straightness; some value crookedness. The appropriateness of all things arises from the subtlest of origins—this cannot be unknown. Thus the wise find it difficult.",

      "translated_text": "Stillness allows the spirit to penetrate; adversity sharpens the mind; nobility refines speech; wealth liberates the body—such is the natural order of principle and circumstance.\n\nThose who share the Dao love one another; those who vie for the same rank envy one another. Those who give together love one another; those who seize together envy one another. The sick love one another; the strong envy one another—such is the nature of human sentiment.\n\nTo possess great talent yet cherish humility; to endure poverty and low station without flattery; to labor without feeling disgraced; to hold high rank and wealth yet grow ever more reverent and diligent—this may be called one of virtue.\n\n**On the Dao of Governance, Chapter Three**\n\nWithout method, people cannot know the cycles of heaven’s four seasons, cold and heat, or the movements of the sun, moon, and stars. Yet if they knew the proper course of heaven’s four seasons, cold and heat, and the movements of the sun, moon, and celestial bodies, then all living creatures of blood and qi would find their place and rest securely in their stations.\n\nLikewise, ministers have no method to know where their lord’s rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments will fall. Yet if they knew the proper application of the lord’s rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments, then the near and far, worthy and unworthy would all exhaust their talents and be put to use.\n\nWhen trust is complete, the world is at peace; when trust is lost, the world is in peril. If the people toil exhaustively and their resources are depleted, contentious and harmful thoughts arise, and trust vanishes.\n\nWhen people lose trust, it stems from governance that is not impartial. When governance is not impartial, it is the fault of the officials. When officials are at fault, it is because punishments and rewards are inconsistent. When punishments and rewards are inconsistent, it is because the ruler is not diligent and enlightened.\n\nIf the ruler is diligent and enlightened, punishments and rewards become uniform. When punishments and rewards are uniform, officials uphold the law. When officials uphold the law, governance flows downward. When governance flows downward, the people find their place and trust one another.\n\nThus, the loss of trust throughout the world stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and enlightenment.\n\nWhen Kang Cangzi dwelled in Xirang for five years, King Ling sent the Duke of Zhai with a basket of silk and a string of fine jade, saying: “I, your humble servant, occupy this position unworthily. With untimely floods and droughts, I, as a mere mortal, wonder how to avert them?”\n\nKang Cangzi replied: “Floods are a disorder of yin. In governance, yin resembles punishment; in human affairs, it resembles selfishness. Drought is an excess of yang. In governance, yang resembles virtue; in human affairs, it resembles fullness.\n\nThe state of Chu holds that whenever floods or droughts occur, the Son of Heaven should rectify punishments and cultivate virtue, while all officials should eliminate selfishness and guard against excess. Then, by correspondence, the calamities will dissipate, and a hundred blessings will arrive daily.”\n\nZheng possessed the Hu jade tablet and the Rong bow, which had once been lost together to Jing. Jing declared: “You must return the jade tablet and the Rong bow. If not, we will march our troops against you.”\n\nThe lord of Zheng was troubled. He rode to see Kang Cangzi and said: “The Hu jade tablet and Rong bow were inherited from our former lord, who received them from Hu—a treasured heirloom passed down through generations, its brilliance and legacy preserved. Now Jing, relying on its might, demands them, threatening military action if we refuse. Our state is in peril. I wish to send other jade tablets and bows in their place. What do you think?”\n\nKang Cangzi replied: “Your lordship should be at ease. Now, Jing also possesses treasures of its own. Adorn their treasures and offer them to Zheng in apology for their offense. What Jing cannot do, you must achieve with the genuine articles.\n\nJing, through a minor transgression, has overstepped its authority and punishments, indulging in unrighteousness to exhaust and weaken its neighboring states. Jing will lose the support of the feudal lords. When the lords hear of this, they will take warning, strengthen their vigilance, and emulate diligent and enlightened governance. They will convene to uphold righteousness, and Zheng will naturally stand at the forefront. Your lordship should wait—could this not be a blessing?”\n\nThereupon, Zheng sent the Hu jade tablet and Rong bow.\n\nBefore they reached Ying, the people of Jing heard of it and said: “They speak with the words of a sage. How can we accept these, displaying our unrighteousness to the world and giving the feudal lords cause to harbor resentment?” They promptly returned the gifts and grew even more favorably disposed toward Zheng.\n\nHuman nature desires life and abhors death, craves security and shuns peril, seeks honor and avoids disgrace. When people attain their desires, they rejoice; when they rejoice, they are at peace. When they do not attain their desires, they suffer; when they suffer, they are in peril.\n\nIf a ruler indulges his desires, then all officials and commoners will likewise pursue theirs. When all officials and commoners pursue their desires, the people of the world—whether poor or rich—will exhaust their strength or their wealth. The four classes will lose their order, and none will attain their desires.\n\nWhen the people of the world do not attain their desires, they will join hands, cling together, and flee in secret, hiding in remote places, drifting and gathering herbs to preserve their lives. Officials will pursue and capture them, and thus they will be unable to endure their peril and suffering. From this, the thought of banding together and rebelling arises. If such thoughts arise, the state will no longer be the state.\n\nDo not covet a large population—it will scatter the people. Do not strengthen the city walls—it will exhaust the people. If taxes and levies are excessive, the poor will grow poorer daily. If punishments and rewards are inconsistent, the noble will grow nobler daily. If laws and prohibitions are not enforced, the state will collapse.\n\nIf officials lack ability, leniency and severity will be misapplied. Some may compete with the people for profit, giving rise to cunning and deceit. Thus, the people become treacherous and difficult to understand.\n\nWhen the world is difficult to understand, superiors grow suspicious. When superiors grow suspicious, subordinates become more confused. When subordinates are confused, officials toil in vain. When officials toil in vain, rewards fail to encourage, and punishments fail to restrain. The state becomes easily agitated and difficult to pacify—all because officials are not properly chosen.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in carefully selecting men of talent. If a man’s talent and conduct are esteemed in one village, entrust him with the village. If his talent and conduct are esteemed in one district, entrust him with the district. If his talent and conduct are esteemed in one province, entrust him with the province. If his talent and conduct are esteemed throughout the state, entrust him with state governance. Only then can no hidden talent remain concealed.\n\nIf a man is wicked and perverse in his village, admonish him. If he does not reform, he is wicked and perverse—then in the district, flog him. If he still does not reform, he is wicked and perverse—then in the province, banish him.",

      "translated_text": "If he still does not reform, he is wicked and perverse—then in the state, execute him. Only then can no rebellious conduct arise.\n\nWhen this is truly so, every person under heaven, each with their heart laid bare, will harbor no trace of defiance, disloyalty, arrogance, or indolence—this is called \"pacifying the people.\" Of all the affairs under heaven, none is greater than seeking men of talent. In seeking men of talent, nothing is better than ensuring smooth governance. In ensuring smooth governance, nothing surpasses pacifying the people. The talent for pacifying the people, when assessed by literary composition, may yield only four or five out of a hundred; when assessed by discourse, perhaps one or two in ten; but when assessed by their demeanor—by the serenity of their spirit and the steadiness of their bearing—eight or nine in ten prove sound. Such discernment is the mark of a sagacious king who flourishes in an enlightened age, for only through careful selection can this be achieved.\n\nIn a declining age under a weak ruler, if men of talent are chosen by literary composition, then artful embellishment and excessive ornamentation will proliferate, while true refinement and plain sincerity will recede. If chosen by discourse, then flattery and ostentatious display will abound, while forthright counsel and honest reproof will fade into obscurity. If chosen by demeanor—by the serenity of their spirit and the steadiness of their bearing—then those who appear upright but harbor inner deceit will rise in prominence, while those of pure conduct and clear integrity will remain hidden. In such times, the more \"worthy\" men are promoted, the more governance strays; the more decrees are issued, the more the people descend into chaos.\n\nThe realm is the greatest of vessels; the emperor’s throne, the weightiest of positions. With the right men, order prevails; without them, chaos reigns. The ruler toils in seeking the worthy but finds ease in their employment.\n\nAlas! He who guards heaven’s mandate and gathers the people—how can he not devote himself sincerely to men of talent? The greatest concern of a ruler is the misalignment of human nature, and of all such misalignments, none is more grievous than the miscarriage of justice. When a judge of keen discernment hears a case, he may employ deception to test the truth, wield authority to compel honesty, appeal to emotion to elicit confession, or impose punishment to break resistance. Though his methods may vary, his judgment must always be impartial. Thus, the people of the realm, in life, owe him no undue gratitude, and in death, bear him no resentment.\n\nTo govern a state, establish officials, and administer justice in this manner is to attain the highest office. In such an age, the hearts of the people are harmonious and upright, all livelihoods flourish, love and respect run deep, and the bonds between high and low are firm, unshakable as a single family. How, then, could rebellion or disorder ever arise?\n\nWhen King Ping restored order and settled in the capital, he devoted himself to seeking men of talent. Upon hearing even a single good report, he would rejoice for days. His attendants repeatedly spoke of ministers with exceptional virtue, and this continued for over a year. The king said: \"I, alone, am deficient in virtue and lack discernment. I strive to seek the worthy, yet I fear that hidden talents in the mountains and marshes remain overlooked. How could I take pleasure in hearing good reports only to shut myself off from them? Recently, flattering courtiers have repeatedly praised those in positions of power, gradually gaining influence at my side. My own weakness and dullness have left me unable to judge clearly, so I have merely followed their lead, allowing their influence to grow unchecked. Of all the ways virtue is undermined and morality corrupted, none is greater than this. Had I corrected this sooner, their cliques would not have taken such firm root.\"\n\nThereupon, he executed three of his closest attendants in the marketplace and demoted five high-ranking officials, declaring: \"Let no minister who serves his lord curry favor with subordinates to deceive those above.\" When the realm heard of this, they praised his clarity and wisdom, and seven states from the west of the Southern Sea pledged allegiance.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, carriages and robes are plain and unadorned, laws are lenient and simple, and prohibitions are few and broad. When carriages and robes are plain, people do not covet excess; when laws are lenient and simple, customs are free from taboos; when prohibitions are few and broad, transgressions are easy to avoid. If people do not covet excess, their desires diminish, and they take joy in their work. If customs are free from taboos, emotions flow freely, and joy and harmony prevail. If transgressions are easy to avoid, good and evil are clearly distinguished, and people value virtue and know shame.\n\nTo take joy in one’s work is called \"compliance\"; to share joy and harmony is called \"concord\"; to value virtue and know shame is called \"rectitude.\" The indolent cannot withstand compliance; the rebellious cannot withstand concord; the wicked cannot withstand rectitude. Compliance, concord, and rectitude—these three are the foundation of good governance.\n\nIn a declining age, carriages and robes are ornate and elaborate, laws are convoluted and superstitious, and prohibitions are harsh and obscure. When carriages and robes are ornate, people vie in extravagance; when laws are convoluted, customs brim with taboos; when prohibitions are harsh and obscure, no one knows where to turn. If people vie in extravagance, they abandon integrity and scorn simplicity in favor of ostentation; if customs brim with taboos, emotions are stifled, and high and low grow estranged; if no one knows where to turn, slander and calamity multiply, and the people no longer fear death.\n\nTo scorn simplicity in favor of ostentation is called \"frivolity\"; estrangement between high and low is called \"obstruction\"; the people’s disregard for death is called \"recklessness.\" Men of true integrity will not serve in an age of frivolity; men of impartial honesty will not serve in an age of obstruction; men of ability will not serve in an age of recklessness. Frivolity, obstruction, and recklessness—these three are the ladders to chaos.\n\nKing Xiong Yu of Jing asked Kang Cangzi about the causes of floods, droughts, order, and chaos. Kang Cangzi replied: \"Floods and droughts are matters of heaven; order and chaos are matters of man. If human affairs are harmonious and well-governed, even floods and droughts cannot bring harm—such were the cases of Yao and Tang. Thus, the Zhou’s official records state: 'Man’s strength overcomes heaven.' If human affairs are corrupt and chaotic, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble—how were Jie and Zhou’s downfalls merely the result of floods and droughts?\"\n\nKing Xiong of Jing bowed northward in reverence and, pressing his forehead to the ground, said: \"Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one, for granting me these words.\"",

When a great criminal is captured by officials and, through broad accusations, implicates the loyal and good—dragging in the distant and unrelated in hopes of shifting blame—only to be pardoned in the end, the victims of the crime find no redress, only self-inflicted harm. Thus, the innocent devise cunning schemes in turn, officials toil under harsh governance, and none can quell the chaos—all due to the fault of frequent amnesties.\n\nPeople refrain from acting lawlessly and unjustly because of punishment; they strive to act with Dao and virtue because of reward. Now, if the lawless and unjust are pardoned while the virtuous and just are harmed and go unrewarded, how can we expect people to turn toward goodness? Would it not be difficult indeed?\n\nIf a wise ruler or outstanding scholar were to examine this: when the people resent, it is not for lack of engagement; when the spirits rage, it is not for lack of sacrifice. The more cunning and flattery abound, the more the people resent; the more excessive the sacrifices, the more the spirits rage.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao of the Ruler**\n\nWhat gives life is heaven; what nurtures and completes is man. One who can nurture what heaven has given without encroaching upon things is called the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven’s actions preserve the qi of heaven—this is how officials establish themselves. Officials are established to preserve life. Yet the deluded rulers of today multiply offices only to harm life, losing the very foundation of their establishment.\n\nGrass congested rots; trees congested breed worms; people congested fall ill; states congested see a hundred evils arise, and peril and chaos become uncontrollable. What is meant by a congested state? The ruler’s virtue is not disseminated below, and the people’s desires are not conveyed above. Therefore, sagely kings value loyal ministers and upright scholars, for they dare to speak frankly and dispel blockages.\n\nRestrain the self and return to ritual, and the worthy and good will come of their own accord. When the ruler plows and the queen tends silkworms, the common people transform naturally. Thus, the worthy and good may be awaited but not sought—those obtained by seeking are not truly worthy. The common people may be transformed but not coerced—coercion does not accord with principle.\n\nYao and Shun labored as rulers but had no personal desires, so the world each attained their wishes. They held the position of ruler but not the mind of one, so the world each gave free rein to their hearts. There are scholars loved by all the world but not by their ruler, and those loved by their ruler alone but not by the world. Employ those loved by all the world, and the world will be at peace; employ those loved by the ruler alone, and the world will be in peril. How can a ruler indulge his own likes and dislikes? Thus, one who values the world’s love must restrain his emotions.\n\nWhat is meant by \"the world\"? It is that which contains the ten thousand things. What is meant by \"the state\"? It is that which contains the multitudes. The state takes the people as its root; when the people are at peace, the state is at peace. Therefore, a ruler who worries for the state seeks those capable of ordering the people.\n\nJade is hard to distinguish because of its resemblance to common stone; gold is hard to distinguish because of its resemblance to brass. Now, if one were to cover a quail with the wings of a falcon, the dim-sighted would see only its age—only the clear-sighted would recognize it as a quail. Today, petty men recite classics and medical texts, or study arcane arts and persuasive rhetoric, and are clad in the robes of high office. The foolish see and hear them and take them for gentlemen; the discerning see and hear them and know them as petty men. Thus, a truly enlightened ruler selects people by their words, by their talents, and by their conduct.\"",

If human affairs are corrupt and chaotic, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble—how were Jie and Zhou’s downfalls merely the result of floods and droughts?\"\n\nKing Xiong of Jing bowed northward in reverence and, pressing his forehead to the ground, said: \"Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one, for granting me these words.\"",

      "translated_text": "When a ruler lacks discernment, selecting people by their words brings chaos; selecting by their talents brings chaos; selecting by their conduct brings chaos.\n\nA sagely ruler employs people by valuing achievements unseen by the ear, unseen by the eye, and inexpressible in words—yet the people naturally govern themselves in harmony. If a ruler values achievements heard by the ear, then all under heaven will transport goods and chase profit to trade for reputation. If he values achievements seen by the eye, then all under heaven will flaunt strange forms and unusual skills to vie for advancement. If he values achievements that can be spoken of, then all under heaven will practice glib tongues and polished phrases to adorn their words. When all under heaven trade for reputation, vie for advancement, and adorn their words—when those who attain prominence are such men—governance fails.\n\nRulers all know that a mirror clarifies their appearance, yet they detest officials who clarify their faults. A mirror’s clarity serves a minor purpose; an official’s clarity serves a great one. To recognize the small but lose the great is to fail to understand categories.\n\nAlas! If a ruler purifies his mind and reduces affairs, and his ministers are reverent, frugal, and dutiful, great peace will swiftly arrive. Yet some find this difficult—how can I comprehend it? If the ruler’s heart is clouded and indecisive, then the harmony of heaven and earth, the four seas, and all living things—plants and creatures alike—will lose their Dao.\n\nThose who select people by what they hear and see fill offices with many yet bring disorder to governance. Those who select by thoughtful consideration keep offices few and governance clear. Thus, in an age of orderly rule, one seeks talents unseen and unheard; in an age of peril and decline, one seeks talents that can be seen and heard. Alas! Does the ruler understand this?\n\nWhen people are selected by what is heard and seen, they all clamor and scheme to buy reputation. When selected by thoughtful consideration, they all remain composed and upright to cultivate virtue. When officials are composed, upright, and diligent in virtue, transformation occurs without words. When officials clamor and scheme to buy reputation, even punishment fails to instill fear—does the ruler of the age understand this?\n\n**On the Way of Ministers (Chapter Five)**\n\nWhen a state is about to rise, the hundreds of officials in its court may be short or tall, plain or handsome, gentle or stern, correct or flawed. Though their words and appearances seem disparate, when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all are devoted to the state. Thus, they offer forthright admonition without resentment, accept demotion without shock, and debate to reach the mean without violating principle. Therefore, heaven does not err in its seasons, earth does not fail in its benefits, people do not disrupt their duties, spirits and gods lend their favor, barbarians submit in harmony, great unity is preserved, and the ten thousand things transform and nurture.\n\nWhen a state is about to fall, the hundreds of officials in its court have mostly fine appearances, harmonious complexions, refined and gentle speech, and polished movements. Though their appearances and words seem amiable, when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all are bent on competing for position. Thus, they find oddities strange, react with shock to differences, and conceal their envy, ultimately losing the Dao. Therefore, heaven sends disasters in its seasons, earth produces perverse things, people commit wicked deeds, spirits and gods sow misfortune, barbarians invade in waves, calamities and chaos multiply, and the ten thousand things fail to transform.\n\nThose who achieve success and establish governance without wasting resources, exhausting the people, or harming officials—whose merits extend from the common people to enhance the ruler’s virtue—are loyal and worthy ministers. Those who squander wealth, trouble the people, endanger officials for fleeting gains, and seek rewards from the ruler while ignoring future disasters for the state are treacherous ministers.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, offices are filled by the right people. In an age of disorder, people seize offices.\n\nWhen Zhulong Ren Kui asked about serving a ruler, Kang Cangzi said: \"One who pledges his name as a minister should hold nothing in his heart but impartiality, nothing in his demeanor but harmony, and nothing in his words but correctness. Impartiality should not be exposed, harmony should not be adulterated, and correctness should not offend.\"\n\nThe ancients who were pure and diligent in governing the state and reforming policy arranged affairs with order, acted appropriately, and aligned with the greater whole. Those today who are pure and diligent cultivate their reputations. They arrange affairs with order, but their reach is obstructed, and they are constrained by minor details.\n\nThus, when the heart takes the Dao as its master, even in handling matters, things find their proper place. When the heart takes matters as its master, even in handling things, they lose their proper place.\n\nA minister in high office who does not admonish, or in low office who is not impartial, does not deserve his salary. When a ruler is not solemn and respectful, and high ministers do not display trustworthiness to their subordinates, ministers do not fit their positions in court.\n\nA talented person is not necessarily loyal; a loyal person is not necessarily talented. Ministers do not fear disloyalty but worry that their utmost loyalty will not be trusted. Rulers do not fear distrust but worry that their trust will not be matched by capable service.\n\nThe highest type of person, when their nature is realized, brings order to all under heaven. The middling type, when their nature is realized, brings chaos to all under heaven. A wise ruler employs the highest type, entrusting them with discretion to act freely as they see fit. When employing the middling type, he must set standards for their achievements and make rewards and punishments clear.\n\n**On the Way of the Worthy (Chapter Six)**\n\nThe worthy are frequently sought yet rarely arrive, difficult to advance and easy to retreat—not because they cherish their lives and refuse to die for the ruler’s affairs, but because they fear their utmost loyalty will not be trusted.\n\nThose who know themselves to be capable and insightful are outwardly respectful yet inwardly untroubled. Among the crowd, they are harmonious and upright without familiarity. Draw near, and they become even more solemn; distance yourself, and they withdraw without resentment. In hardship, they accept fate with ease; in prosperity, they correct themselves with the Dao.\n\nSome appear worthy in their bearing, sound worthy in their voice, yet when their spirit is tested and their knowledge examined, they fall short of expectations. When the worthy are employed, they offer subtle counsel in court and remain silent abroad, diligently attending to their duties, living simply and leisurely at home. When not employed, they conceal themselves among the crowd, hide their insight from view, restrain their words, eat their fill, walk at ease, cultivate their own integrity, and remain steadfast without resentment.",

Those of discernment walk through peril yet their countenance remains unruffled; their words are modest yet their principles unshakable. Truly, the worthy do not call themselves worthy—their efficacy lies in governance, their merit in every task.\n\nIn times of great peace, the highest scholars apply their insight, the middling exhaust their endurance, and the petty offer their strength. In Qi there was a man named Pouzi, whose talents could have revitalized the state, whose conduct could have stood alone. He served his parents with filial reverence, and in his village he was respectful and compliant. Yet dwelling in poverty with nothing to provide for them, he practiced trust and righteousness and wandered for a long time. Why did he find so few in accord?\n\nSome, riding the tide of the times, flattered and fawned, and he was mocked and deceived by them. Thus, staff in hand and on foot, he went to consult Kangcangzi, saying: \"I have heard that the perfected forget emotion, while the common people do not manage their affairs with emotion. Those who retain emotion devote themselves to teaching and esteem trust and righteousness. Yet now I do not know how to act: should I accept distrust as trust, or trust that is not trusted as trust? Should I toil in admiration of righteousness as righteousness, or be deemed righteous without awaiting righteousness? If so, then those who uphold trust and righteousness are ever alone in hardship and retreat—how then can they be valued by the times, or elevated by the principles of teaching?\"\n\nKangcangzi lowered his head and stroked his beard, then looked up and sighed. Suddenly he burst into song: \"When the times are bright, trust and righteousness flourish; when the times are silent, trust and righteousness lie hidden. Brightness and silence, flourishing and concealment—why should I favor one over the other? Swiftly they shift, and I cannot grasp their meaning.\"\n\nTo align one’s true nature with the Way and yet find no response in things—this is true inaction.",

      "translated_text": "When the true and unobstructed Way is no longer practiced, it is called the loss of the Dao. In times of Dao’s loss, the superior person retreats—this is the meaning of concealment. There are those whose actions may be observed, yet none can act as they do; there are those who may be employed, yet when the state follows the Dao, they appear wise, and when the state strays from the Dao, they appear foolish. Thus, none can truly employ them.\n\nDuke Ji asked: \"From where do worthy talents arise?\"\nKangcangzi replied: \"The truly virtuous may be awaited but not sought; talent must be sought with care, for carelessness yields none. If the Son of Heaven is serene, his great ministers enlightened, punishments do not spare the noble, and favor does not exclude the lowly, then worthy men will come of their own accord seeking employment. When worthy men are employed, all within the four seas will see with clarity, hear with purity, and hold their hearts open without oppression. Heaven will perfect itself, earth will settle, the myriad things will mature in harmony, and even spirits will be powerless to intervene. Thus, the truly virtuous may be awaited but not sought.\n\nIf the Son of Heaven is diligent and his great ministers seek talent with harmonious governance, then magnanimous, upright, and steadfast men will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is harsh and exacting, and his great ministers seek talent with impatience, then cunning, obsequious men who distort principles will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is suspicious and jealous, and his great ministers seek talent with flattery, then those with strange names and bizarre arts will arrive. If the Son of Heaven deems himself wise, and his great ministers cling to their positions, then men who chase reputation with empty words and corrupt, frivolous displays will arrive. If the Son of Heaven wavers, and his great ministers resort to deceit, then men who feign loyalty while harboring malice, whose words are gentle but hearts venomous, will arrive. Thus, talent must be sought with care, for carelessness yields none.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained Changxian, Feng Hong, Rong Qiu, and Shang Tang gained Yi Yin; the revival of the Zhou saw Fu Shen; Duke Huan of Qi found Ning Ji—all because these rulers embodied the Dao, surpassed in benevolence, displayed sagely martial virtue, sought harmony and brilliance, and governed with magnanimity and uprightness. Thus, the worthy came of their own accord seeking employment, not through rigid selection.\n\nDuke Ji asked: \"You say the worthy do not seek but come of their own accord—are there also the unworthy who do not seek but come of their own accord?\"\nKangcangzi replied: \"Indeed, the unworthy who do not seek but come of their own accord are many. When the world follows the Dao, the worthy do not seek but come of their own accord; when the world strays from the Dao, the unworthy do not seek but come of their own accord. Rulers who follow the Dao are few, while those who stray are many; the worthy are few, while the unworthy are many. Thus, the unworthy who do not seek but come of their own accord are many.\"\n\nDuke Ji asked: \"The worthy surely save the world, and talent can also save the world—if both save the world, how do the worthy and the talented differ?\"\nKangcangzi replied: \"Your question is pressing! When deeds are accomplished and tasks completed, to refuse titles and renown, to withdraw with humility and frugality—this is the mark of the worthy. When deeds are accomplished and tasks completed, to bask in emoluments and praise, to exult in full ambition—this is the mark of talent. The worthy can stabilize a state; talent can govern a state. By 'stabilize,' I mean harmonizing and pacifying through non-action, so that none perceive their effort. By 'govern,' I mean diligently managing affairs, so that all recognize their virtue. One worthy can lead a multitude of talents with ease, but a multitude of talents cannot measure up to one worthy—such is the distinction between the worthy and the talented.\n\nThere are those who dwell in mountains and forests yet clamor, and those who live amidst worldly customs yet remain still. There are those who clamor yet remain upright, and those who are still yet harbor wickedness. Generally, when one observes their coarse and vulgar appearance, finding a truly worthy man among them is as rare as one in ten thousand. Yet when one observes their refined and elegant appearance, discovering they are petty men occurs nine times out of ten. To discern their refinement without scrutinizing their words, to assess their bearing without demanding their demeanor, to recognize their goodness without heeding their praise, and to judge their truth without being swayed by slander—this is the mark of true discernment.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: Following the Dao**\n\nMin Ziqian asked Confucius: \"How do the Dao and filial piety differ?\"\nConfucius replied: \"The Dao is the wondrous function of nature. Filial piety is the supreme virtue of human relations. It encompasses and moves heaven and earth, nurtures the myriad things, shapes all forms, and bestows nature and longevity. Its merit is most substantial, yet it does not serve as a storehouse for things, nor as an office for affairs. It does not claim credit for its achievements, and though one may seek it through touch, sight, or hearing, none can possess it. It is called the Dao. When applied to humanity, it is called filial piety.\n\nFilial piety is the name for serving one’s parents well. In serving one’s parents well, reverence and compliance are fundamental. One’s intentions should align with theirs, one’s compliance should match their countenance, and nothing should be left undone. In uttering a word or forming an intention, one must not dare to forget one’s parents. In moving a hand or lifting a foot, one must not dare to forget one’s parents. In serving one’s lord, one must not dare to be disloyal; with friends, one must not dare to be untrustworthy; toward subordinates, one must not dare to be disrespectful; in pursuing goodness, one must not dare to be idle. Even in the solitude of one’s chamber, one must not dare to relax one’s sincerity—this is called perfect filial piety.\n\nThus, the utmost sincerity of filial piety reaches the spirits and shines across the four seas. It elicits a response to every feeling—this is the result of serving one’s parents well. Of old, Shun was most filial. Though his stepmother deceived his father, who repeatedly sought to harm him, Shun’s heart grew only more reverent, his fear deepened, yet he bore no resentment. When they schemed to have him dredge a well, and earth was piled upon him, heaven’s favor shook the spirits, and he emerged from a side tunnel. His devotion in serving them grew ever more meticulous, and thus his dark virtue flourished, making him lord of the world—this was the result of serving his parents well.\n\nWhen King Wen was crown prince, he was most filial. Morning and evening, he would go to the outer gate of his father’s chamber and ask the attendants: 'How is he today? How does he fare?' If told he was well, the crown prince’s face would brighten with joy. If his condition was even slightly unstable, the crown prince’s countenance would fill with worry. When meals were presented, he would first check their temperature, and after they were served, he would inquire about the dishes offered before withdrawing.\"",

      "translated_text": "When the attendants reported illness, the crown prince would solemnly don his cap and fast. He would respectfully inspect the dishes prepared by the royal chefs, and personally taste the medicinal broths offered. If the food was good, the crown prince could eat; if the food was poor, he could not eat his fill. Only when his father’s condition returned to normal would his own appetite return to normal.\n\nWhen the lord had faults, he would gently admonish with a soothing voice. Even for small things the lord cherished, he would treat them with utmost reverence. Thus, filial piety perfected his person, and the Dao harmonized the world.\n\nThe *Ya* states: \"King Wen ascended and descended, ever at the Lord’s side,\" meaning that in King Wen’s stillness and action, advance and retreat, Heaven must have aided him—thus Zhou could not harm him. His dream foretold a long life, divination thirty generations, seven hundred years—all Heaven’s mandate, the result of serving his parents well.\n\nMin Ziqian asked: \"I have been fortunate to learn the way of serving parents well. May I ask about the principles of teaching children?\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"The Three Kings in teaching their children always observed ritual and music. Music cultivates the inner self, ritual cultivates the outer. When ritual and music are cultivated together, virtue and bearing shine forth in one’s appearance, enabling one to be warmly respectful and civilized.\n\nNow, if a minister would sacrifice his life for his lord’s benefit, how much more should he benefit himself to serve his lord well? Thus, they selected loyal, upright, and steadfast scholars as teachers and transmitters, desiring them to understand the Dao of father and son, lord and minister, elder and younger.\n\nOnly when one knows how to be a son can one be a father; only when one knows how to be a minister can one be a lord; only when one knows how to serve others can one employ others. These are the principles by which the Three Kings taught their children.\"\n\nMin Ziqian withdrew and practiced these principles at home. For three years, no one could find fault with his words toward his parents or brothers. His companions praised his trustworthiness, his village praised his benevolence, his clan praised his fraternal duty. The reputation of his virtuous conduct spread throughout the world—this was the result of serving his parents well.\n\nThe crown prince of Qi sat upon the Clear Terrace. Yan Zhuanghou Tuo approached, wearing a tall cap and stern expression, a jade-hilted sword at his left, pendants at his right, their radiance illuminating left and right. The crown prince, reading a book, did not look up. Zhuanghou Tuo asked: \"Does Qi possess treasures?\"\n\nThe crown prince replied: \"A lord who is trustworthy and ministers who are loyal, with the people supporting their superiors—these are Qi’s treasures.\"\n\nZhuanghou Tuo immediately unbuckled his sword and departed.\n\nAlas! Can a person have biases and remain unaware of them for a lifetime? The worthy see them but forgive and do not speak; petty men, in their reckless affection, speak excessively; relatives, in their pity and envy, sow discord.\n\nHow can one with biases not know them? Thus, the noble person examines himself as if he always has faults. Wearing his clothes, eating his food, knowing his faults yet unable to correct them—this the noble person considers shameful. When about to speak, if he knows his words cannot be put into practice, the noble person seldom speaks.\n\nWhen reproaching others’ faults, does one examine one’s own goodness? When reproaching others’ errors, does one examine one’s own rectitude? This is called \"turning the mirror inward.\"\n\nThe son of Di Xi was most filial and cautious. Di Xi, pitying his son, often spoke recklessly to him. When Di Xi left in the morning and returned in the evening, he would say: \"So-and-so has died.\" His son believed him, yet later found the person alive. Another evening, he would say: \"So-and-so is about to harm you.\" His son watched for the man to take revenge, yet saw no ill intent. Another evening, he would say: \"So-and-so is ill.\" His son observed him, yet the man was in good health. Such instances accumulated over the years.\n\nThe son remained filial and cautious, but in matters of instruction and discipline, he could no longer trust or obey. The people of his village and state detested his father’s reckless speech and plotted to kill him. Di Xi, hearing this, grew fearful and returned to tell his son. The son did not fully believe him, yet soon after, Di Xi was killed.\n\nThose who speak excessively are called careless and indiscreet, yet some are sparing in words but not discreet. Those who are frivolous are called unstable, yet some have composed demeanors but restless hearts. Those who are meddlesome are called petty, yet some appear pure outwardly but are impure within. Such types, when categorized and enumerated, cannot all be recorded. Without thorough understanding, who can fully investigate and discern them?\n\nThere are times when one cannot but respond—within, one is still, yet without, one acts, easily moved but difficult to calm. There are times when one cannot but seek—within, one reflects, yet without, one waits; only when the time comes does one rejoice.\n\nThus, those who are still outwardly but restless inwardly harm their nature through agitated thoughts. Those who chase profit through constant activity exhaust their strength and damage their reputation.\n\nSome in the world may not achieve their aspirations and claim they have not met their time—this is no different from bearing the guilt of a crimson neck, awaiting execution when the time comes. Is this not perilous?\n\nThose with vast talent and broad understanding who are not recognized or employed may rightly say the times are not unclean, but their fate has not aligned—is this not correct?\n\nThose skilled in remonstrance strive to preserve the nature of those they advise and prune the emotions from which faults arise, thus fostering mutual advancement and deepening respect and affection. Those unskilled in remonstrance attack the nature of those they advise and are blind to the origins of emotions, thus breeding mutual suspicion and resentment day by day.\n\nWhat children find simple, the elderly may reject; what pleases the eyes and ears may trouble the mind.\n\nThose who harshly reproach the world’s foolishness are themselves not wise; those who harshly reproach the world’s delusion are themselves not enlightened. Reproaching the multitude’s foolishness while oneself is unwise leads to ruin; reproaching the multitude’s delusion while oneself is unenlightened leads to harm.\n\n**Agricultural Dao, Chapter Eight**\n\nWhen people abandon fundamentals and pursue secondary matters, their commands are not unified. Without unified commands, they cannot defend or fight. When people abandon fundamentals and pursue secondary matters, production dwindles and resources are scarce. With scarce production, they lightly abandon their homes, and with frequent migration, the state suffers constant disasters.",

      "translated_text": "**Agricultural Dao, Chapter Eight (continued)**\n\nAll cultivate distant aspirations, none settle their minds. When people abandon fundamentals and pursue secondary matters, they delight in cunning; delighting in cunning breeds deceit, and deceit leads to manipulating laws and decrees. Manipulating laws and decrees inverts right and wrong.\n\nThe way ancient sage-kings governed the people was to prioritize agriculture. Farmers do not merely seek profit—they value the fulfillment of their aspirations. When people engage in agriculture, they become simple; simplicity makes them easy to employ, and ease of employment secures the borders, which in turn elevates the ruler’s standing. When people engage in agriculture, they become honest; honesty reduces self-interest, and reduced self-interest establishes public law.\n\nExerting strength in deep plowing increases production; increased production makes migration burdensome, and reluctance to migrate ensures unwavering resolve—thus the world’s qi unifies in a single heart. When the world is of one heart, even the governance of the Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor would not surpass it.\n\nThe reason ancient sage-kings vigorously promoted plowing and weaving was to establish them as foundational teachings. Thus, the Son of Heaven personally led the feudal lords in plowing the sacred field, while officials of all ranks were ranked by merit to encourage respect for production. The queen and concubines led the palace women in silkworm rearing at the suburban altars, tending mulberry fields to urge diligent labor—a model of feminine virtue.\n\nMen do not weave yet are clothed; women do not plow yet are fed. Through the exchange of labor between men and women, each sustains the other’s livelihood—this was the system of the sage-kings. Thus, they revered the seasons and cherished the days, assessed yields and evaluated work, resting only in old age or illness. The toil of one sustains ten. During the farming season, earthworks were not initiated, nor were troops mobilized; men did not leave their posts, nor were women married away, so as not to disrupt agriculture.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"The four seasons cannot be forced—only the five grains can be properly cultivated.\" Cultivation depends on human effort, growth on Heaven, and nourishment on earth. Thus, when plowing, leave room for the foot; when hoeing, leave room for the hand; when weeding, leave room for the fingers—this is the Dao of farming.\n\nFarmers produce food, artisans craft tools, merchants trade goods. If the seasons are not honored and earthworks are imposed, it is a great misfortune. Early crops must precede the season; late crops must not lag behind it. If cold and heat are unbalanced, crops suffer many disasters.\n\nFifty-seven days after the winter solstice, yang begins to grow—this is when plowing commences. The Dao of farming is this: see life and sow, see death and reap. Heaven sends the seasons, earth yields resources—these do not await human timing. In years of plenty, sacrifice to the earth; in years of scarcity, still do not miss the proper time. Begin when the season arrives, cease when it passes, and even the old and weak can be fully employed.\n\nThose who do not understand the seasons act prematurely or lag behind, neglecting the proper time—this is the lowest form of farming. Plowing must be done early to ensure fertile soil and loose earth. Crops thrive in fine soil and firm ground; carefully select seeds, neither too dense nor too sparse. When applying soil, neither stint nor overdo it. Furrows should be deep and straight, ridges fertile and level. Below, they receive shade; above, sunlight—then all will grow.\n\nSeedlings planted in rows mature quickly; strong and weak do not harm each other, so they grow swiftly. Straighten the rows, clear the center, and allow qi and cool breezes to circulate—then there will be harvests and abundant yields. Crops that appear lush from afar but sparse up close are stolen by the earth. If left unweeded, they become overgrown; if over-weeded, they wither—both cause harm.\n\nYoung seedlings prefer solitude; mature plants prefer companionship; ripe crops prefer mutual support. When these three thrive together, the harvest is abundant. If seedlings do not sprout and die together, the early ones yield fine grain, while the late ones become chaff. Thus, when thinning, keep the elder and remove the younger.\n\nDo not let plants in fertile soil grow too luxuriantly; do not let plants in barren soil grow alone. Luxuriant growth in fertile soil produces much chaff; solitary growth in barren soil leads to many deaths. Those who do not understand thinning remove the elder and nurture the younger, discarding the grain and keeping the chaff. If above and below are unsettled, crops die in great numbers.\n\nTimely millet grows tall with large ears, round grains with thin husks, sweet and fragrant rice that is easy to hull and hearty to eat. Untimely millet has deep awns, slender stalks, sharp ears, much chaff, and withered leaves.\n\nTimely millet has long, awnless ears, plump grains, and little husk. Untimely millet has thick stalks, flowering stems, greasy leaves, and short ears.\n\nTimely rice has long, dense stalks and ears like horse tails. Untimely rice has slender, weak stalks, thick husks, and withers prematurely.\n\nTimely hemp has sparse nodes, bright color, sturdy fibers, and small roots. Untimely hemp has dense branches, short stalks, rough nodes, and worm-eaten leaves.\n\nTimely beans have long stalks and short roots, pods in clusters of fourteen, many branches, numerous nodes, lush leaves, and heavy, satisfying seeds. Untimely beans grow long vines, floating leaves, weak roots, sparse nodes, and small pods.\n\nTimely wheat has long stalks with clustered necks, grains arranged in rows of fourteen, thin husks, and a golden-yellow color; eating it makes one robust and strong. Untimely wheat is swollen and diseased, with weak seedlings and sparse ears.\n\nThus, timely crops are abundant; untimely crops are meager. All grains are suitable when properly cultivated, and eating them strengthens the four limbs, sharpens hearing and vision, repels malign qi, and prevents ailments. How excellent is Confucius’ saying: \"In winter, a full stomach warms the body; in summer, it cools it.\" When warmth and coolness are seasonally appropriate, people suffer no illnesses.",

Rising from his mat, he turned northward, prostrated himself, and struck his jade tablet to the ground, saying: \"Does Heaven truly have no intention of aiding this lonely one?\"\n\nKàngcāngzǐ, his gaze softening with a faint smile, replied: \"I deemed Your Majesty’s bearing extraordinary—why trouble yourself with such wearisome inquiry? Though one’s qi may be blunted by cutting or stabbing, the suppressed will naturally rise to rectitude. There is no alternative.\"\n\nKing Jing bowed twice, straightened his embroidered robe, adjusted his jade tablet, and lowered his head in deference, saying: \"This is indeed Heaven’s decree.\"\n\nKàngcāngzǐ looked upward in prayer, exhaled slowly, then composed his expression and spoke: \"The origins of warfare arise with man. All warfare is the manifestation of human power. This power is innate, bestowed by Heaven—thus the roots of warfare reach far into antiquity. Even for the briefest moment, it cannot be set aside: noble and base, young and old, wise and foolish all partake in it alike.\n\nObserve the omens of war: when resentment smolders in the heart yet remains unexpressed, that is war; when one glares fiercely and flushes with anger, that is war; when arrogant words are met with forceful rebuttal, that is war; when boastful combat erupts, that is war. These four are conflicts great and small.\n\nBefore the age of Chīyóu, men already wielded wooden clubs to fight. The Yellow Emperor employed water and fire; Gònggōng sowed chaos; the Five Emperors contended with one another—each rise and fall saw the victor prevail. If one dies from swallowing medicine, should all physicians be banned? If one drowns in a boat, should all ships be forbidden? If a state is lost through warfare, should all arms be abolished? Warfare cannot be abolished—it is like water and fire: wielded well, it brings fortune; wielded poorly, it brings disaster.\n\nThus, anger and punishment cannot be abolished in the household; penal laws cannot be abolished in the state; military campaigns cannot be abolished in the world. The sage-kings of antiquity had righteous armies but no abolition of arms. When arms are truly righteous, they punish tyrannical rulers and relieve the suffering of the people. The people rejoice as a filial child beholds a loving parent, as a starving servant encounters a feast. They rush forward with cries, swift as a powerful crossbow loosed into a deep valley.\n\nVictory or defeat need not be sought elsewhere—it must return to human nature. All desire life and shun death, seek honor and avoid disgrace. When the path of life and death, honor and disgrace is unified, the three armies can be made of one mind. An army desires numbers, but even more, it desires unity of heart. When the three armies are of one mind, commands can render them invincible.\n\nThe supreme army values its commands: where its orders are strong, its enemy is weak; where its orders are trustworthy, its enemy yields. Victory secured here ensures victory there. If this is so, how can any enemy prevail?\n\nWhen the enemy advances, it seeks gain. If it arrives only to meet death, then retreat becomes its advantage. If all enemies see retreat as advantageous, blades will never clash—this is the supreme army.\n\nArrogance, cruelty, deceit, and righteous principle stand in opposition; their forces cannot both triumph, nor can they coexist. Thus, when a righteous army enters enemy territory, the people know whom to shelter. When it reaches the outskirts of cities and towns, it does not trample crops, desecrate graves, plunder stores, or burn homes. Captives are treated generously and sent home.\n\nTrust is pledged to the people, enemy resources are seized, good and evil are made clear, and defiance or compliance is demonstrated. If, despite this, there remain those who stubbornly defy, arrogantly resist, and persist in rebellion, then military action may be taken.\n\nFirst, a proclamation is issued: 'Our army comes to avenge the people’s wrongs and align with Heaven’s Dao. Thus, when we conquer a state, we do not massacre its people—we punish only the guilty.' Then, worthy scholars and virtuous men are selected and honored; the lonely, sick, and elderly are sought out and rescued. Treasury wealth is distributed, granary grain is scattered, no goods are hoarded, and courtesy is extended without partiality.\n\nIf a man here could grant life or death to one person, all under Heaven would vie to serve him. A righteous army grants life to many—who would not rejoice? Thus, when a righteous army arrives, the people of neighboring states flock to it like flowing water, and the people of the condemned state look to it as to parents.\n\nThe farther it marches, the more people it gains. Its words had not yet ended when King Jing rose, prostrated himself, and said: 'This lonely one has received the Master’s teachings and feels his qi fill the cosmos, his will now knowing its direction. My heart swells with reverence.'\n\nHe stepped forward, raised a goblet, and toasted Kàngcāngzǐ’s longevity. He bowed, placing him at the head of the ranks of his teachers, and prepared a solemn chamber for him. A month passed, then ten days, and at the hour of Tiānguān, he walked the Way in broad daylight.\n\n*The Scripture of the Penetrating Spirit* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "Excess of talent is not as good as timely appropriateness. To know Heaven’s patterns is not as good as conforming to them; to conform to them is not as good as delighting in them. When the myriad things are full, drought follows. Thus, the sage does not act, yet nothing is left undone. If one doubts this, observe the superior person: when perversity arises in his demeanor, he corrects it; if he does not, this is called evil.\n\nTo follow the natural order is to be upright; to establish offices is to be orderly. To love the people is to be benevolent; to employ their abilities is to be wise. The great man, how could he not know this? Thus, when the state is well-governed, he displays wisdom; when the state is in chaos, he feigns foolishness. Therefore, though he may not reach such heights, in ancient times, when Yao yielded to Shun, the world turned toward virtue of its own accord. When Shun yielded to Yu, the people followed without coercion. When Jie and Zhou were slain, the people rejoiced. When Tang and Wu took the throne, the people submitted.\n\nThose who delight in knowledge bring harm to their persons; those who act recklessly exhaust their strength. The silkworm spins its thread until its body is spent; the craftsman labors with his hands until his years are worn. The mouth and throat become the tombs of the five flavors; the body and qi are consumed by excess. When arrogance and indulgence prevail, even the most reverent cannot save the state.",
