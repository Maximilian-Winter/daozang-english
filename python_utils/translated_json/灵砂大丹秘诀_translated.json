  "full_translation": "*The Secret Formula of the Numinous Cinnabar Great Elixir*\n\n**Title:** *The Secret Formula of the Numinous Cinnabar Great Elixir*\n**Author:** Unknown. The text claims that Ge Hong transmitted the elixir method to Master Xuqing (Zhang Jixian of the late Northern Song), who passed it to Attendant-in-Ordinary Zhang, who then conveyed it to Chan Master Guiyan of Dongchuan. Likely composed in the early Southern Song. One scroll.\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Compendium of Arts* section under the *Dongshen* Department.\n\n---\n\n### *The Secret Formula of the Numinous Cinnabar Great Elixir*\n**The Embryo of Oneness: The Numinous Cinnabar**\n\nTo shed the mortal frame and exchange the shell, to sit in liberation or stand in transcendence—this is the dragon coiled within the golden crucible, the tiger circling the cinnabar field: such is the *inner* method. The red and white lead and mercury, the true gold and supreme treasure, which neither flee when refined nor scatter when smelted—this is the *outer* method.\n\nThose who study the Dao yet fail to succeed do so because they can cultivate the inner but not the outer, refine the inner but not the outer. Thus, if affairs are not balanced, the Way is difficult to achieve. The people of this world, shallow in understanding and meager in fortune, do not encounter a master who teaches both. Only the *Numinous Cinnabar of Oneness* can externally enrich families and states, and internally perfect the Great Dao—it is the supreme medicine of immortality and deathlessness.\n\nWhen quails consume it, they become phoenixes; when chickens consume it, they become fenghuang; when dogs ingest it, they become dragons. If a person partakes of it, they may attain sagehood and ascend as an immortal. The aged who take it become youthful; withered corpses and dead bones, upon receiving it, are reborn.\n\nThe superior adept who cultivates the Dao and performs meritorious deeds, upon obtaining this, ascends to the realm of immortals—this is the inner vision of the *Sacred Embryo Numinous Cinnabar*. Taking easily obtained herbs and readily accessible medicines, the practice is not cumbersome, yet its achievements are vast: nurturing mercury into treasure, cultivating medicine into elixir. With treasure, one aids in practical use; with elixir, one ascends the Dao—this is the outer vision of the *Sacred Embryo Numinous Cinnabar*.\n\nPeople err by altering the color of lead and mercury improperly or by mismanaging the exchange of yin and yang, thus failing to render mercury’s body immortal. Further, using base silver as the matrix, adhering mineral stones to the body, or ingesting the matrix within a vessel—these methods yield no emptiness, for they are not the true *Sacred Embryo*. Such failures stem from an impure transmission of the method. Yet they blame the immortals for deception, a consequence of their own frivolous and careless practice.\n\nWhen the sages transmit this, they may expound it in secret treasures, inscribe it on jade tablets, or seal it in golden caskets—only after purification rites may one behold it, and only the most worthy may hear of it. The method was passed from Laozi to Master Ge Xuan, from Ge Xuan to Zheng Siyuan, from Zheng Siyuan to the Perfected Ge Hong, from Ge Hong to Celestial Master Zhang Xujing. In the first year of the *Jianzhong Jingguo* era, during the third month, the Celestial Master entered the court, where Chamberlain Zhang was summoned to the imperial presence to discourse on the art of seed cultivation. The emperor and the Celestial Master transmitted it to Chamberlain Zhang. Later, when Chamberlain Zhang took office in Shuchuan, he passed it to Chan Master Guiyan. Now, the lineage is complete, its beginning and end fully preserved. Those who obtain it elevate seven generations of ancestors; those who cultivate it shall surely ascend the clouded path. In great use, it enriches the state and pacifies the people; in small use, it fattens the family and nourishes the self.\n\nTo prepare the vessel for washing and infusion, undergo nine transformations of creation: when the *Qionglin* grove flourishes, lofty scholars revere it; when the *jade laughter* endures, celestial immortals pay homage. It harmonizes with the mysterious principles of Heaven and Earth, seizing the correct qi of yin and yang. As the *Daodejing* states: *\"What cannot be seen is called the Subtle; what cannot be heard is called the Rare.\"* Thus, the elixir undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations—this is the *Numinous Cinnabar*. Master Zhongli said: *\"A single grain of golden elixir ensures eternal life.\"* This is that very elixir. Generations of sages and worthies have cultivated it; ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures never stray from its discourse.\n\nThe *Numinous Cinnabar* governs the elixir’s crucible, leads the practice of cultivation, is the ancestor of the great medicine, and the origin of the golden elixir. Sulfur is the essence of the Great Yang; mercury is the qi of the Great Yin. When the yang soul dies and the yin spirit perishes, it is the union of husband and wife, the harmonious qi of yin and yang. Those without merit or conduct, who hoard wealth and discard their lives, the unworthy and irreverent—this secret must not be revealed to them.\n\nFor the method, use two parts sulfur and eight parts mercury cinnabar to produce ten taels of *green gold*. For the *green cinnabar seeds*, take half a tael of chalcanthite, three taels of smoked plum, and soak them in rice vinegar within a sand pot. Boil the first-born *green gold* for one full day and night, without using a water-or-fire crucible. Then place it into a vessel of true dead sulfur, lining the bottom with sand, covering the top, and setting it within a light-ash furnace. Nurture it with fire for twenty-one days.\n\nRemove and grind it finely to form a vessel, then refine it to produce *white-body numinous cinnabar*. The fire regimen is as follows: on the first day, use two and a half taels of mature fire morning and evening; on the third day, two taels morning and evening; on the seventh day, four taels morning and evening; on the tenth day, five taels morning and evening; on the fifteenth day, five taels morning and evening; on the sixteenth day, six taels morning and evening; on the seventeenth day, seven taels morning and evening; on the eighteenth day, half a catty morning and evening; on the nineteenth day, ten taels morning and evening; on the twentieth day, one catty morning and evening; on the twenty-first day, one and a half catties in the morning and two catties in the evening. Once the furnace cools, remove it and use it as silver. Refine it in a lead pool to form a *Sacred Embryo* vessel, then grind it into powder to refine the *white-body numinous cinnabar*.\n\nA poem says:\n*The Great One’s Numinous Cinnabar is rarely heard of,*\n*As yin and yang unite and ascend on high.*\n*The clear intent of Heaven and Earth’s creation,*\n*Requires the Dao’s inner and outer harmony.*\n\nFor every three taels of refined *Sacred Embryo Numinous Cinnabar*, one tael of *white-body numinous cinnabar* may be nurtured. The boiling method is as before; the fire regimen and duration remain the same. The *white-body numinous cinnabar* must not be boiled. Grind it into powder, form a vessel, and refine it to produce *jade zither numinous cinnabar*.\n\n**Second Transformation:**\nTake one catty of *white-body numinous cinnabar*, grind it into powder, and place it in the upper and lower layers of the vessel to nurture half a catty of *longevity jade zither numinous cinnabar*—that is, one catty nurtures half a catty, or two taels nurture one tael. The fire regimen lasts fourteen days, without boiling. With two maces of this *jade laughter numinous cinnabar*, one tael of mercury may be transmuted into the *cinnabar yang supreme treasure*. If forming a vessel for washing and infusion, the fire regimen is as follows: on the first and second days, use one to two taels of mature fire morning and evening; on the third and fourth days, four taels morning and evening; from the fifth to seventh days, five taels morning and evening; from the eighth to tenth days, six taels morning and evening; on the eleventh and twelfth days, half a catty morning and evening; on the thirteenth day, one catty morning and evening; on the fourteenth day, one and a half catties morning and evening. Once the furnace cools, remove it to form a vessel for washing and infusion.\n\nA poem says:\n*The returning elixir, seven returns and three completions,*\n*Seek the wondrous essence of the poem, clearly discerning.*\n*Black and white treasures divide creation,*\n*Bathed in the Flowery Pond, one ascends of itself.*\n\n**Third Transformation:**\nTake half a catty of *longevity jade laughter numinous cinnabar*, infuse it into the vessel, and it may transmute four taels of mercury. Nurture it with fire morning and evening for one day; by the next dawn, the mercury will be dead. Do not remove it yet—infuse another four taels of mercury, also nurturing it with fire for one day. By the next day, it too will be dead, but it must not yet be removed.\n\nProceed thus thrice in the infusion of mercury, then may the first infusion be retrieved once. The *sprout* must always be retained. After two infusions of mercury, the mercury remains within the vessel—this method is called the \"Morning-Sown, Evening-Reaped\" technique, and it becomes the vessel of immortality and deathlessness. Infuse one *qian* into the *sprout*, and it may transmute one tael of mercury into a treasure of the finest hue. If used to form a vessel, it may nurture the cinnabar *elixir-head*.\n\nFor the fire regimen: in the morning, use six taels of *mature fire*; in the evening, use half a catty. Retrieve it only the following evening.\n\nA poem says:\n*No need for mortal silver—its body is light,*\n*Departing its womb-qi, it awakens of itself.*\n*Thus I, attuned to the numinous, may transform and change,*\n*From this, the Elixir Yang gains its renown.*\n\n**Fourth Transformation:**\nTake four taels of *gleaming jade sprouts* to nurture one tael of *cinnabar* as the *elixir-head*, with a fire regimen of fourteen days. If nurturing one tael of *colored frost*, with one tael of *colored frost*, it may be blended with mercury to form silver, or may transmute one tael of mercury into the finest treasure. With one *qian* of nurtured cinnabar, it may transmute one tael of black iron into a treasure, dividing the embryo to form the precious.\n\nIf four taels of cinnabar *elixir-head* are placed within a golden vessel, they may refine the body of gold. The fire regimen and weight for the *elixir-head* follow the method of the white-body vessel.\n\nA poem says:\n*The pomegranate husk parts of itself,*\n*Green divides the moon-turtle’s play.*\n*Freely it transforms and changes,*\n*Guiding the sage to shatter mortal delusion.*\n*Only the morning’s sown is seen—*\n*Who knows the sacred mechanism is revealed?*\n*Dogs devour, parrots feast,*\n*Yet phoenix transforms, dragon returns.*\n\n**Fifth Transformation:**\nTake four taels of refined cinnabar *elixir-head*, place them in a golden vessel, grind finely, and seal as prescribed. Bind with iron wire, then nurture for three times seven days. Each day, morning and evening, apply only one and a half taels, with *mature fire* ash two *cun* high. This cinnabar may transmute hardened, contracted *slanderous metal* into crimson gold. One *qian* transmutes one tael of *slanderous metal*, yielding half a *qian* of *geng* and becoming silver.\n\nA poem says:\n*Behold the merit accumulated—spirit-like,*\n*The slanderous metal brought into the true path.*\n*Attaining my transformed shape, changing its substance,*\n*The profound principle, free of greed, is the true\n\nA poem says:\nThe Primordial One’s great black *elixir-head*,\nAccumulated merit and deeds sought for generations.\nWith sincere heart, the Three Pure Ones grant the Dao,\nOnly then does the elixir form after countless autumns.\nWhen the outer medicine is complete, household and state prosper;\nWhen the inner elixir coalesces, one roams the Penglai Isles.\nBurning incense, bowing in gratitude to the immortals and sages,\nOnly today do I realize I did not cultivate early enough.\n\n**First: Establishing the Weight and Matchmaker**\nA gentleman at forty has yet to meet his kin—\nThe *gentleman* is yang.\n*Forty* is four taels of sulfur.\nA maiden guards her empty chamber for sixteen springs—\nThe *maiden* is yin.\n*Sixteen* is one catty of mercury.\nSeeking a worthy matchmaker to unite them,\nThe *worthy matchmaker*: first take a silver vessel, regardless of quantity, and boil it in vinegar for half a day; discard the silver vessel. Then boil the mercury in the vinegar until the vinegar is dry, remove the mercury, and wipe it dry with paper.\nThe great Dao’s intent lies in human generosity.\nThose who obtain this method should broaden their hearts.\n\nMaster Xuanzi says: Attain it in the body, and wealth and nobility follow; hear of the Dao and virtue flourishes.\n\n**Second: Stir-Frying and Uniting the Couple in the Womb**\nAbove the hall stand the parents-in-law,\n*Above the hall* is the womb.\nBelow the hall dwell the kin,\n*Below the hall* is the fire.\nAll bear the meritorious service of civil and martial arts—\nUse civil and martial fire for stir-frying.\nFirst pierce the womb with a needle, heat it over a slow fire, then add sulfur to melt into liquid. Next, add mercury and swiftly stir with an iron spoon until it dries into clumps. If ghostly flames arise, spray with vinegar—best to prevent the flames from rising.\n\nDo not despise the lowly maid for her withered appearance,\nMercury is called the \"girl\"; though she seems to say, \"Do not scorn my withered visage,\" within she harbors true treasure.\nFor she embraces a drop of gold—\nSeeing the black within the azure gold, it transforms into true gold.\n\n**Third: Refining in the Crucible**\nToday I arrive at the home of my parents-in-law,\n*Parents-in-law* are the father- and mother-in-law.\nWithin the crucible is a mortar; take the stir-fried azure gold, grind it finely in a mortar, then pour it into the mortar. Seal the navel of the upper crucible with a small amount of sulfur mixed with honey. Then, at the three mountain points, mix red halloysite with water to a thick consistency, and firmly seal it to ensure complete security. Seal the upper crucible’s mouth with salt clay, reinforcing the entire body. Wrap it in layers for six or seven rounds of heating—\n*The outer layer* is the water crucible, filled with water above.\n*The inner layer* is the crucible where the medicine melts into liquid.\n*The rounds* are the charcoal. Use twelve or thirteen catties of charcoal.\nSeal the door’s crevices so nothing escapes—\nEnsure the seal is tight, allowing no leaks.\n\nEasychild Zi says:\nWithin water, hear the tiger’s roar;\nWithin fire, listen to the dragon’s chant.\nConceal the body in the chamber of seclusion—\nYin and yang inverted, life’s work begins.\nThis is the method of water above, fire below.\n\nEasychild Zi says: The Water Tiger and Fire Dragon—this is what they mean.\n\n**Fourth Stage: Tempering Before Hardening—Fragility and Decay**\nBrought forth beyond the door, it crumbles on its own.\nRemove it from the crucible, take out the cinnabar—\nif it forms a single sheet yet remains unhardened,\ngrind it all finely and return it to the crucible.\nIt still will not harden.\nThen return it home for six or seven rounds—\nas before, use thirteen catties of charcoal.\nThus it remains unseen by others,\nsealed tightly to prevent leaks.\nMay it chime like jade pendants, resonant and clear—\neach strike of the cinnabar tempers it firm,\nlike the ringing of jade ornaments.\n\n**Fifth Stage: Suspended Embryo Refinement**\nSplit with an axe, the embryo placed in a pouch—\nuse an axe to break it into small pieces,\nthe size of gleditsia seeds,\nthen place them in a small cloth bag for dark-embryo steeping.\nThe Lord of the Dao’s heart boils with the fires of Yan Zhou.\nTemper it with fire.\nThe divine remains unaware, roaring like saltpeter—\nwithin the crucible, refine it together with fire pressing close.\nWhen the liquid lessens, add more in due time.\nSteep the suspended embryo for one full cycle.\nWho knows the intent of the master from the night before?\nLaughing, he points to the red paste descending the fishing rock.\n\n**Sixth Stage: Adhering Elixir to the Body**\nWithin fire, flying borax; within stone, oil—\nfly the borax with fire, then boil it in petroleum.\nUpon entering, powdered frost is most worthy of refinement.\nPowdered frost is finely ground lead.\nTake the steamed divine cinnabar, wash it clean with water, and dry it thoroughly.\nBoil it in petroleum for two or three hours, then remove and place it in a large cup.\nFirst, grind dried borax finely and sprinkle it over the cinnabar, mixing until evenly white.\nNext, add calomel, then lead white frost, mixing until uniformly white.\nThen place it in a container and cultivate it with lotus nourishment.\nClearly, there is a principle of thoroughfare and obstruction—\nspare yourself the search to the ends of the earth.\n\n**Seventh Stage: Enclosure in the Crucible**\nFour and one originally form the five metals—\nuse four taels of mountain marsh powder to nurture one tael of divine cinnabar.\nThe mother abundant, the child scarce, like lotus seeds—\nin a pool worth ten thousand coins, with utmost sincerity, nurture it.\nThe fire’s timing aligns with heaven’s transformative mechanism.\nLike planting lotus seeds, ensure they do not touch one another.\nFor one catty of mother-body powder, mix lightly with a little vinegar.\nThe divine cinnabar’s essence lies hidden within,\nsealed with two or three layers.\nPaper ash firmly cradles the base,\nthe fire below applied evenly, step by step.\nFive taels, half a catty of fire—\nthe embryo divides, revealing the treasure’s form.\nFor one catty of mother powder, mix well with good vinegar.\nFirst, spread a layer of mother powder in the container,\nthen plant all four taels of cinnabar,\ncovering it again with mother powder so the cinnabar is not exposed.\nSeal the mouth’s seams with red halloysite,\nthen reinforce the entire body with clay.\nOnce dry, place it in an ash pit,\nresting the container on a tripod,\nand nurture it according to the fire’s timing.\nWho knows this is the path to transcendence?\nWithout the destined affinity, do not stir the heart—\nknowing the way to ascend as an immortal,\nif one lacks the predestined connection, remain unmoved.\nEmbrace poverty, guard your lot, and find joy in heaven’s decree.\n\n**Eighth Stage: Applying the Fire’s Timing**\nOne, two, two—add three, four, five.\nFour eights surround, five eights the body.\n\n**First Day of Applying Fire**\nOn the first day, remove the container from the ash pit and cover it with two fingers’ thickness of paper-money ash. Place two taels of well-charred charcoal fire atop it, replacing it constantly to prevent the fire from dying.\n\n**Second Day**\nAdd three taels of fire.\n\n**Third Day**\nAdd four taels of fire, taking care not to exceed this amount.\n\n**Fourth Day**\nIncrease the fire to eight taels. Insert four taels around the container and place the remaining four taels atop the ash, allowing the container to glow red throughout.\n\n**Fifth Day**\nMaintain the same fire timing as the fourth day.\nThis is the profound and mysterious true image—do not exceed, lest life be harmed.\nThe fire must grow from small to large; if the timing is too intense, the elixir will flee.\nThe fire’s timing must be gradual and even to achieve success.\n\n**Ninth Stage: Removing from the Container**\nNever forget the oath sworn by the arm’s flesh—\nobserve his true heart, which has not forgotten form.\nAfter seven days of fire timing, remove the container and let it cool.\nOpen it to examine the cinnabar: bite it with your teeth.\nIf it is dark green, heavy, and dense, it has become treasure.\nIf it remains red, it is not yet fully refined.\nReturn it to the container for further nurturing, applying the previous six days of fire timing—seven full days are required.\n\n**Tenth Stage: Dividing the Embryo**\nTwo vessels interact, one holding the other—\nmix with mercury and divide the embryo with care.\nThe two vessels are the crucible and the medicine pot.\nFor the medicine pot, grind equal parts croton seeds, castor beans, *anemarrhena*, and *fritillaria* into a fine powder.\nMix with dates to form a thick paste, shaping it into a medicine pot.\nPlace it inside the crucible and dry in the shade.\nThen add the nurtured cinnabar into the medicine pot.\nHeat it in a qi furnace until it melts into liquid, stirring constantly.\nAdd saltpeter until both the medicine pot and its contents liquefy, turning a pale blue-white.\nPour into a mold—once set, it can be forged without fear.\n\n**Beyond the Three Vehicles, Proper Transportation**\nThe three vehicles—goat cart, deer cart, and ox cart—\ncan transport all beings out of the burning house.\nThose who attain this method escape all afflictions.\nThey must rely on the three gates to fan and refine it.\nPour it into the refining furnace three times to behold the treasure.\n\nIt is also said: the \"three fixations\" refer to the third transformation.\nThe first transformation cannot yet enter sagehood;\nby the third, one naturally transcends and enters sagehood—most profound.\n\n**Nine Cycles of the Golden Elixir**\n\n**First Cycle: Refining the Divine Cinnabar**\nRefining divine cinnabar reveals its origin:\nfour taels of sulfur, two taels of silver.\nFirst melt them into liquid and pour into the crucible.\nWhen flames rise, spray with vinegar.\nPlace the first ingredient, *qingjin*, into the vessel,\nsealing the medicine bottle with clay to prevent leakage.\nMeasure the fire’s timing carefully—do not err.\nMaintain even progression before and after.\nOnce formed, break into pieces the size of soapberries,\nrefining them for ten hours.\nPlace in the container, ensuring no gaps—\nafter ten days of transformation, it becomes true.\nWhen removed, its color is black;\ntest with fire to confirm the tooth-mark imprint.\nThe *Huachi* bath removes sulfur’s scent—\nonly then can one trust that mercury has become silver.\n\n**Second Cycle: Birth of the Sacred Embryo**\nOnly in the second cycle does one know the power of transmutation—\nthe sacred embryo’s birth reveals the true source.\nFirst spread four taels of mercury powder as the base,\nthen plant cinnabar like a lotus, layer by layer.\nArrange four taels in order,\ncovering the top with mother powder.\nSeal with *guan* clay and nurture for two seven-day periods to completion.\nWhen opened, the treasure is formed—\npraise the divine alchemy of the immortals.\n\n**Third Cycle: Jade Pool’s White Lotus Container**\nIn the third cycle, the Jade Pool blooms a white lotus.\nBurn incense and purify the chamber—focus is essential.\nPour two taels of mercury (no more, no less)—\nif too much, the strength cannot sustain seven days.\nWhen the time comes, use the previous method to gather it,\nforming a container for longevity.\nDivine cinnabar nurtures the profound mystery.\nLet fellow seekers heed these words—\nthis method must not be shared with the vulgar.\n\n**Fourth Cycle: Moon-Bright Pool Container of the Immortal’s Palm**\nThe fourth cycle is called the \"Golden Valley Seed.\"\nArrange it properly within the vessel.\nPour two taels of *liuzhu* and apply gentle fire,\nadjusting the timing over seven days.\nWhen the celestial cycle is complete, it seizes creation—\njade countenance dons a robe of purple gold.\nClearly state: sow at dusk, reap at dawn—\ndo not let the poor know this lightly.\n\n**Fifth Cycle: Purple Mansion’s Golden Lotus Container**\nThe fifth cycle’s golden lotus dwells in the Purple Mansion’s depths.\nBoil mercury with *danfan*—do not delay.\nThis is called \"Yellow Laughter,\" never to be leaked—\nit is the supreme medicine from prior stages.\nEntering the vessel to transcend the mundane is no small matter;\nthe birth of mother and child has its reasons.\nWithin this method lies the immortals’ mystic art—\nconsume it, and ride the clouds beyond the islands.\n\n**Sixth Cycle: Purple Mansion’s Gushing Spring Golden Container**\nIn the sixth cycle, the sprout is nurtured to perfection—\nwithin the vessel, jade petals bloom naturally.\nRepeatedly pour mercury, refining within lead—\nsow at dusk, reap at dawn to see the treasure’s bloom.\nIn the furnace, it gleams purple,\ncrystalline and golden, shimmering like rosy clouds.\nKnow that this path is hard for mortals to grasp—\nguard your words, do not boast recklessly.\n\n**Seventh Cycle: Seven-Return Golden Liquid Returned Elixir Container**\nIn the seventh cycle, the elixir completes its return—\ncinnabar nurtured without need for lead.\nFive metals instantly transmute into treasures.\nTo detoxify, bury it in a wellspring.\nA frail man who consumes it will be transformed;\nan old man who takes it will retain youthful countenance.\nIf a hermit in the mountains encounters this,\na single grain will carry him to the ninth heaven.\n\n**Eighth Cycle: Return-to-Origin Divine Liquid Golden Elixir Container**\nThe eighth cycle is called \"Return-to-Origin Divine Liquid.\"\nThe union of yin and yang is a principle hard to fathom.\nNurture cinnabar powder in the furnace—\nafter seven days, when opened, all is yellow.\nInstantly transmute the five metals into supreme treasures.\nA chicken that eats a grain will become a phoenix.\nThe immortals of old left this true method—\nto lightly show it to mortals brings calamity to nine generations.\n\n**Ninth Cycle: Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir Container**\nThe ninth cycle’s elixir is called the \"Great Return.\"\nLong ago, the Eight Elders bestowed it upon Liu An.\nIn secluded caves and grottoes, it startles gods and ghosts,\nits radiance like sunlight, its hues manifold.\nThose of the Dao who consume it gain transformation—\nthe Dark Lord who swallows it treads the cloudy ends.\n\n**Attaining Transcendence Requires This—**\nSuch matters are wholly beyond the ken of ordinary folk.\n\n**The Four-Turn Method of Master Red Pine**\n\n**Regimen**\n\n**First Turn: Frost-of-Flying-Flowers Method**\nTake one catty each of realgar, orpiment, and cinnabar.\nRefine each separately, then grind together into a fine powder.\nPlace in an earthen crucible, lining the bottom with half a tael of cinnabar blossom.\nNext, layer the realgar powder, then the orpiment powder, and cover with another half tael of cinnabar blossom.\nSeal tightly to prevent qi from escaping.\nSet upon the Three Terraces and Five Peaks, firing with reeds and reeds for three days and nights.\nCool for one night, then remove—the elixir thus produced can transmute thirty catties of gold.\n\n**Second Turn**\nPlace the previous frost into an earthen crucible, covering it with lead yellow blossom.\nSeal and dry in the shade for ten days, then fire with a gentle flame for three days and nights as before.\nWhen cool, remove—one tael of this elixir can transmute one hundred catties of gold.\n\n**Third Turn**\nCover with white wax *heche*, firing for three days and nights.\nWhen cool, remove—one tael of this elixir can transmute two hundred catties of gold.\n\n**Fourth Turn**\nUse lead-white *heche*, mixing alum powder into the *heche* until it resembles thick mud for sealing.\nSeal and fire for three days and nights as before, then cool and remove.\nOne tael of this elixir can transmute four hundred catties of gold.\n\n**The Method of Drawing Out Reeds**\nGrind together one tael of malachite, two taels of refined saltpeter, one *qian* of borax, and two and a half *qian* of alum.\nHeat *duzhi* oil in a crucible until it boils, then stir in the powdered ingredients until the mixture resembles damp sand.\nPlace a crucible in the furnace and heat until glowing red.\nSpoon the mixture into the crucible until it is seven-tenths full, then cover with a tile.\nHeap coals around it and heat until the mixture liquefies.\nStir with a dry willow branch dozens of times, but do not let it sink to the bottom.\nWhen the saltpeter liquid begins to dry, pour it onto the ground to separate mother and child.\nRemelt in a crucible, then use as desired for transmutation—its texture is exceedingly fine and wondrous.\n\n**The Method of Light Powder**\nGrind together one catty of black alum and half a catty of salt.\nPlace in an earthen jar and boil with prepared liquid until it forms a paste, stirring evenly.\nBoil for half a day until it turns yellow.\nAdd four taels of yellow yeast and one tael of mercury, grinding them together.\nSoon the mercury will spread across the surface.\nSeal with a tile basin and fire to sublimate.\nWhen cool, collect the powder.\n\n**The Method of Powder Frost**\nGrind together half a tael of alum, four taels of white alum, two taels of salt, half a tael of saltpeter, two taels of mercury, and two taels of black alum until no mercury globules remain.\nStir-fry in an iron pan until powdered, then pile into a large bowl.\nCover with wet paper to seal the gaps, then seal with good clay.\nWhen cool, collect the frost.\nTake one tael of the previous frost, grind it with two taels each of salt and alum, and place in a water-and-fire crucible.\nSublimate according to the cinnabar method—this is the final product.\n\n**The Rhapsody on the Supreme-Polarity Divine Cinnabar**\n\nThe divine elixir is not valued by lesser men,\nyet the Jade Emperor bestows its blessings upon the immortals above.\nMoved by the Sage’s compassion,\nhe transmits the secret of divine cinnabar by word of mouth.\n\nCombine two ingredients and stir-fry to form a shape—\nonly then can the treasure be revealed.\nAfter nine turns, when swallowed into the belly,\none instantly ascends to heaven.\n\nOriginally, the Sulfur Lad had forty households,\nyet he sought not the beauty of a sixteen-year-old maiden.\nLacking a master, the two remained bound,\ntheir union dependent on a matchmaker.\n\nThe golden terrace’s candle flame need not be lit,\nwhile the jade pool’s bitter wine is poured again and again.\nThe couple in the flask grow ever more intimate,\nyet the elders in the hall remain displeased.\n\nFrom this, the jade countenance withers—\nonly the harmonizing of the divine medicine can restore it.\nTrue cinnabar takes form,\nfurther refined by civil and martial means.\n\nThe supreme treasure gleams in secret,\nheed not the ugliness of its appearance.\nThe crucible mirrors the Two Modes—\nits firmness and completeness are most wondrous.\n\nTwice prepare a tael of ginger juice,\nthrice seal with half a finger’s weight of clay.\nEnter the bridal chamber—\npound the green-gold powder within,\nseal the mouth’s seams with honey-mixed red halloysite.\nAdd an equal portion of clamshell powder,\nthen seal again with yellow-clay mud,\nbinding tightly with gleaming white iron wire.\n\nWhen striking the plate, be ever attentive.\nWhen nurturing the elixir, remain equally vigilant.\n\nThus, refine the essence of sun and moon,\nharmonizing the principle of Kan and Li.\nPlace the crucible in the furnace,\nbury the flask beneath the earth.\n\nSeal it tightly—\nlet the fire penetrate for one full cycle.\nHeap the coals high—\nlet them rise four fingers’ breadth.\n\nPlace four taels of fire beneath the crucible,\nleaving room for eight parts water within.\nWhen the five metals blaze,\nlisten for the dragon’s chirp and the tiger’s roar.\n\nAfter two days, open it—\nwait until the fire cools and the ashes grow cold.\n\nGenerally, if the cinnabar remains fragmented,\nit may be fired again with added heat.\nOnce its body is firm and hard,\nthen speak of its wondrous, godlike nature.\n\nCut with a knife into pieces the size of soap beans,\nsuspend and boil until the bubbles resemble fish eyes.\nAdd a pinch of lead frost,\nand replenish the fermenting agent frequently.\n\nSteep for a day and night,\nor boil for ten hours.\nRemove from the pouch—\nbathe in hot water.\n\nMoisten slightly on the tongue,\nthen blend with jade nectar.\nCombine with four powders—\nlead-white frost and light powder,\npowder frost and borax in equal parts.\nGrind them exceedingly fine and apply to the entire body.\n\nTen *qian* of divine medicine serve as the child,\nfour taels of the vessel’s mother return to their kin.\nLike planting lotus seeds in order,\nplace them into the golden crucible for repeated warming.\n\nArrange them without letting them touch,\nkeeping each separate in the center.\nCover without exposing,\nburying evenly above and below.\n\nMarvelous! The *Records of the Historian* contains no account,\nyet the immortals transmit the method.\nThe coal burns exquisitely—\nthe pool’s belly grows warm.\nThe charcoal fire nurtures gently—\nthe crucible’s heart heats evenly.\n\nA slight roasting with ash prevents qi from scattering,\nwhile an overturned basin prevents loss.\nThus the count remains unbroken.\n\nAdvance in four increments until reaching four taels, seven or eight *qian*, and finally use eight followed by three *qian*. Arrange them according to the four cardinal directions, and after seven days, they will penetrate completely. Keep the chamber tightly sealed to prevent any draft, ensuring the ash remains as pristine as snow. Should the form not yet manifest, do not neglect the teeth’s craving; observe the heart’s cinnabar hue still red. Continue nurturing the fire as scheduled until the bones turn black through and through, and the whole becomes verdant—then success is near.\n\nOnce the true foundation is established, the cinnabar attains its utmost potency. Immerse it in the Flowery Pond for refinement, adjusting the charcoal fire to harmonize. The two stars of lead are ultimately discarded; the inner child of one tael soon finds peace. Only then does yang reach its peak and yin dissipate, revealing the image of the Yellow Flower. As days pass and months flow, the form of the white crane becomes ever clearer. Truly, the mystery is profound beyond mystery, secrecy beyond secrecy.\n\nThis reveals the divine efficacy of transforming treasures, distinct from the oral teachings of the Returned Elixir. When pointing to inner matters, how could it be merely a minor benefit? This Dao, once attained, may only be transmitted to the right person. If bestowed upon the unworthy, heavenly calamity will swiftly follow.\n\n**Divine Cinnabar Secret Formula**\nWondrous is the divine medicine, passed down by the sages of old. It refines sun and moon, gathers yin and yang. With water and fire precisely balanced, as if enduring the passage of stars and frost, powder, borax, and mercury submit—three dragons may be subdued. Golden radiance becomes the medicine, jade trees bear fragrance. Longevity knows no bounds, enduring as heaven and earth.\n\nOnly those with the bones of immortals may deeply guard and conceal it. To transmit it to the unfit is to invite misfortune upon oneself. I have briefly compiled this in the capital, associating with the powerful. Of the two principles of life and destiny, I have glimpsed their essence. Often perusing alchemical classics, this purple text speaks much of the methods of the Yellow and White, the defense of lead and mercury—yet for three thousand years, a thousand attempts and ten thousand failures have yielded no success.\n\nOne day, by fortune, I encountered a master of the highest order, who discoursed on the golden crucible and the divine cinnabar, the supreme medicine. Solitary yin cannot generate; lone yang cannot transform. Yin conceals yang and becomes pregnant; yang embraces yin and takes form. Yin qi produces; yang qi engenders. Since the beginning of time, this qi has been transmitted to the present. When the purest essence resonates, the True One is born. All things arise from the mother; a thousand spirits are transformed by qi. The child grows plump while the mother grows thin; the child grows large while the mother declines. Without birth from the womb of father and mother, nothing exists.\n\nIn making the elixir, one must harmonize the hun of heaven, the po of earth, the essence of metal, the fluid of stone, the bones of the dragon, and the marrow of the phoenix. This is the union of yin and yang, transforming qi with qi, transforming man with man. From womb, egg, moisture, or transformation—whether in mountains, seas, or on land, whether flying, swimming, moving, or growing—all are born through the resonance of qi. The dragon can subdue the tiger; the tiger can tame the dragon. The dragon inhales the tiger’s blood; the tiger absorbs the dragon’s essence. Only through mutual restraint is the Dao of the elixir accomplished.\n\nThe natures of the five metals differ; the origins of the eight stones are profound. A single day’s fire timing seizes a thousand years of creation. Heaven and earth are set within a fleeting moment; dead lead and mercury are transformed in an instant. Refine the crucible, and qi becomes spiritually responsive. Dragon and tiger mate; sun boils and moon surges. Within this wondrous process, what is sown in the morning is reaped by evening. The yang elixir changes the bones; transmutation is divine. The inner elixir can prolong life and extend years; the outer elixir can enable transcendence and ascension. The sacred principle is clear, the celestial mechanism revealed. Fearing the obscurity of immortal traces, I have meticulously recorded the beginning and end.\n\nBefore the twin cypress hall, I chose an auspicious day and hour. Without a single day’s effort, I nurtured a treasure of a thousand years. Without immortal bones, it cannot be achieved; without virtue and power, it cannot be encountered. If not for the long-accumulated blessings of ancestors, how could one ever attain it?\n\n**Lord Lao’s Divine Elixir Formula**\nNo head to the cauldron, no ears to the pot. *Geng* serves as the outer, *Gen* as the inner. No other flavors—just apply directly. Only water and fire are paired. Uprooting the cogongrass is still false; shrinking the *he* is not yet true. To know the truth, there is nothing beyond dead mercury.\n\n**The Great Divine Cinnabar Secret Formula Concludes**\n\n*(Note: The final lines indicate possible missing subtitles, marked as #1 and #2 in the original.)*",

      "translated_text": "The superior adept who cultivates the Dao and performs meritorious deeds, upon obtaining this, ascends to the realm of immortals—this is the inner vision of the *Sacred Embryo Numinous Cinnabar*. Taking easily obtained herbs and readily accessible medicines, the practice is not cumbersome, yet its achievements are vast: nurturing mercury into treasure, cultivating medicine into elixir. With treasure, one aids in practical use; with elixir, one ascends the Dao—this is the outer vision of the *Sacred Embryo Numinous Cinnabar*.\n\nPeople err by altering the color of lead and mercury improperly or by mismanaging the exchange of yin and yang, thus failing to render mercury’s body immortal. Further, using base silver as the matrix, adhering mineral stones to the body, or ingesting the matrix within a vessel—these methods yield no emptiness, for they are not the true *Sacred Embryo*. Such failures stem from an impure transmission of the method. Yet they blame the immortals for deception, a consequence of their own frivolous and careless practice.\n\nWhen the sages transmit this, they may expound it in secret treasures, inscribe it on jade tablets, or seal it in golden caskets—only after purification rites may one behold it, and only the most worthy may hear of it. The method was passed from Laozi to Master Ge Xuan, from Ge Xuan to Zheng Siyuan, from Zheng Siyuan to the Perfected Ge Hong, from Ge Hong to Celestial Master Zhang Xujing. In the first year of the *Jianzhong Jingguo* era, during the third month, the Celestial Master entered the court, where Chamberlain Zhang was summoned to the imperial presence to discourse on the art of seed cultivation. The emperor and the Celestial Master transmitted it to Chamberlain Zhang. Later, when Chamberlain Zhang took office in Shuchuan, he passed it to Chan Master Guiyan. Now, the lineage is complete, its beginning and end fully preserved. Those who obtain it elevate seven generations of ancestors; those who cultivate it shall surely ascend the clouded path. In great use, it enriches the state and pacifies the people; in small use, it fattens the family and nourishes the self.\n\nTo prepare the vessel for washing and infusion, undergo nine transformations of creation: when the *Qionglin* grove flourishes, lofty scholars revere it; when the *jade laughter* endures, celestial immortals pay homage. It harmonizes with the mysterious principles of Heaven and Earth, seizing the correct qi of yin and yang. As the *Daodejing* states: *\"What cannot be seen is called the Subtle; what cannot be heard is called the Rare.\"* Thus, the elixir undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations—this is the *Numinous Cinnabar*. Master Zhongli said: *\"A single grain of golden elixir ensures eternal life.\"* This is that very elixir. Generations of sages and worthies have cultivated it; ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures never stray from its discourse.\n\nThe *Numinous Cinnabar* governs the elixir’s crucible, leads the practice of cultivation, is the ancestor of the great medicine, and the origin of the golden elixir. Sulfur is the essence of the Great Yang; mercury is the qi of the Great Yin. When the yang soul dies and the yin spirit perishes, it is the union of husband and wife, the harmonious qi of yin and yang. Those without merit or conduct, who hoard wealth and discard their lives, the unworthy and irreverent—this secret must not be revealed to them.\n\nFor the method, use two parts sulfur and eight parts mercury cinnabar to produce ten taels of *green gold*. For the *green cinnabar seeds*, take half a tael of chalcanthite, three taels of smoked plum, and soak them in rice vinegar within a sand pot. Boil the first-born *green gold* for one full day and night, without using a water-or-fire crucible. Then place it into a vessel of true dead sulfur, lining the bottom with sand, covering the top, and setting it within a light-ash furnace. Nurture it with fire for twenty-one days.\n\nRemove and grind it finely to form a vessel, then refine it to produce *white-body numinous cinnabar*. The fire regimen is as follows: on the first day, use two and a half taels of mature fire morning and evening; on the third day, two taels morning and evening; on the seventh day, four taels morning and evening; on the tenth day, five taels morning and evening; on the fifteenth day, five taels morning and evening; on the sixteenth day, six taels morning and evening; on the seventeenth day, seven taels morning and evening; on the eighteenth day, half a catty morning and evening; on the nineteenth day, ten taels morning and evening; on the twentieth day, one catty morning and evening; on the twenty-first day, one and a half catties in the morning and two catties in the evening. Once the furnace cools, remove it and use it as silver. Refine it in a lead pool to form a *Sacred Embryo* vessel, then grind it into powder to refine the *white-body numinous cinnabar*.\n\nA poem says:\n*The Great One’s Numinous Cinnabar is rarely heard of,*\n*As yin and yang unite and ascend on high.*\n*The clear intent of Heaven and Earth’s creation,*\n*Requires the Dao’s inner and outer harmony.*\n\nFor every three taels of refined *Sacred Embryo Numinous Cinnabar*, one tael of *white-body numinous cinnabar* may be nurtured. The boiling method is as before; the fire regimen and duration remain the same. The *white-body numinous cinnabar* must not be boiled. Grind it into powder, form a vessel, and refine it to produce *jade zither numinous cinnabar*.\n\n**Second Transformation:**\nTake one catty of *white-body numinous cinnabar*, grind it into powder, and place it in the upper and lower layers of the vessel to nurture half a catty of *longevity jade zither numinous cinnabar*—that is, one catty nurtures half a catty, or two taels nurture one tael. The fire regimen lasts fourteen days, without boiling. With two maces of this *jade laughter numinous cinnabar*, one tael of mercury may be transmuted into the *cinnabar yang supreme treasure*. If forming a vessel for washing and infusion, the fire regimen is as follows: on the first and second days, use one to two taels of mature fire morning and evening; on the third and fourth days, four taels morning and evening; from the fifth to seventh days, five taels morning and evening; from the eighth to tenth days, six taels morning and evening; on the eleventh and twelfth days, half a catty morning and evening; on the thirteenth day, one catty morning and evening; on the fourteenth day, one and a half catties morning and evening. Once the furnace cools, remove it to form a vessel for washing and infusion.\n\nA poem says:\n*The returning elixir, seven returns and three completions,*\n*Seek the wondrous essence of the poem, clearly discerning.*\n*Black and white treasures divide creation,*\n*Bathed in the Flowery Pond, one ascends of itself.*\n\n**Third Transformation:**\nTake half a catty of *longevity jade laughter numinous cinnabar*, infuse it into the vessel, and it may transmute four taels of mercury. Nurture it with fire morning and evening for one day; by the next dawn, the mercury will be dead. Do not remove it yet—infuse another four taels of mercury, also nurturing it with fire for one day. By the next day, it too will be dead, but it must not yet be removed.",

      "translated_text": "**First Day of Applying Fire**\nOn the first day, remove the container from the ash pit and cover it with two fingers’ thickness of paper-money ash. Place two taels of well-charred charcoal fire atop it, replacing it constantly to prevent the fire from dying.\n\n**Second Day**\nAdd three taels of fire.\n\n**Third Day**\nAdd four taels of fire, taking care not to exceed this amount.\n\n**Fourth Day**\nIncrease the fire to eight taels. Insert four taels around the container and place the remaining four taels atop the ash, allowing the container to glow red throughout.\n\n**Fifth Day**\nMaintain the same fire timing as the fourth day.\nThis is the profound and mysterious true image—do not exceed, lest life be harmed.\nThe fire must grow from small to large; if the timing is too intense, the elixir will flee.\nThe fire’s timing must be gradual and even to achieve success.\n\n**Ninth Stage: Removing from the Container**\nNever forget the oath sworn by the arm’s flesh—\nobserve his true heart, which has not forgotten form.\nAfter seven days of fire timing, remove the container and let it cool.\nOpen it to examine the cinnabar: bite it with your teeth.\nIf it is dark green, heavy, and dense, it has become treasure.\nIf it remains red, it is not yet fully refined.\nReturn it to the container for further nurturing, applying the previous six days of fire timing—seven full days are required.\n\n**Tenth Stage: Dividing the Embryo**\nTwo vessels interact, one holding the other—\nmix with mercury and divide the embryo with care.\nThe two vessels are the crucible and the medicine pot.\nFor the medicine pot, grind equal parts croton seeds, castor beans, *anemarrhena*, and *fritillaria* into a fine powder.\nMix with dates to form a thick paste, shaping it into a medicine pot.\nPlace it inside the crucible and dry in the shade.\nThen add the nurtured cinnabar into the medicine pot.\nHeat it in a qi furnace until it melts into liquid, stirring constantly.\nAdd saltpeter until both the medicine pot and its contents liquefy, turning a pale blue-white.\nPour into a mold—once set, it can be forged without fear.\n\n**Beyond the Three Vehicles, Proper Transportation**\nThe three vehicles—goat cart, deer cart, and ox cart—\ncan transport all beings out of the burning house.\nThose who attain this method escape all afflictions.\nThey must rely on the three gates to fan and refine it.\nPour it into the refining furnace three times to behold the treasure.\n\nIt is also said: the \"three fixations\" refer to the third transformation.\nThe first transformation cannot yet enter sagehood;\nby the third, one naturally transcends and enters sagehood—most profound.\n\n**Nine Cycles of the Golden Elixir**\n\n**First Cycle: Refining the Divine Cinnabar**\nRefining divine cinnabar reveals its origin:\nfour taels of sulfur, two taels of silver.\nFirst melt them into liquid and pour into the crucible.\nWhen flames rise, spray with vinegar.\nPlace the first ingredient, *qingjin*, into the vessel,\nsealing the medicine bottle with clay to prevent leakage.\nMeasure the fire’s timing carefully—do not err.\nMaintain even progression before and after.\nOnce formed, break into pieces the size of soapberries,\nrefining them for ten hours.\nPlace in the container, ensuring no gaps—\nafter ten days of transformation, it becomes true.\nWhen removed, its color is black;\ntest with fire to confirm the tooth-mark imprint.\nThe *Huachi* bath removes sulfur’s scent—\nonly then can one trust that mercury has become silver.\n\n**Second Cycle: Birth of the Sacred Embryo**\nOnly in the second cycle does one know the power of transmutation—\nthe sacred embryo’s birth reveals the true source.\nFirst spread four taels of mercury powder as the base,\nthen plant cinnabar like a lotus, layer by layer.\nArrange four taels in order,\ncovering the top with mother powder.\nSeal with *guan* clay and nurture for two seven-day periods to completion.\nWhen opened, the treasure is formed—\npraise the divine alchemy of the immortals.\n\n**Third Cycle: Jade Pool’s White Lotus Container**\nIn the third cycle, the Jade Pool blooms a white lotus.\nBurn incense and purify the chamber—focus is essential.\nPour two taels of mercury (no more, no less)—\nif too much, the strength cannot sustain seven days.\nWhen the time comes, use the previous method to gather it,\nforming a container for longevity.\nDivine cinnabar nurtures the profound mystery.\nLet fellow seekers heed these words—\nthis method must not be shared with the vulgar.\n\n**Fourth Cycle: Moon-Bright Pool Container of the Immortal’s Palm**\nThe fourth cycle is called the \"Golden Valley Seed.\"\nArrange it properly within the vessel.\nPour two taels of *liuzhu* and apply gentle fire,\nadjusting the timing over seven days.\nWhen the celestial cycle is complete, it seizes creation—\njade countenance dons a robe of purple gold.\nClearly state: sow at dusk, reap at dawn—\ndo not let the poor know this lightly.\n\n**Fifth Cycle: Purple Mansion’s Golden Lotus Container**\nThe fifth cycle’s golden lotus dwells in the Purple Mansion’s depths.\nBoil mercury with *danfan*—do not delay.\nThis is called \"Yellow Laughter,\" never to be leaked—\nit is the supreme medicine from prior stages.\nEntering the vessel to transcend the mundane is no small matter;\nthe birth of mother and child has its reasons.\nWithin this method lies the immortals’ mystic art—\nconsume it, and ride the clouds beyond the islands.\n\n**Sixth Cycle: Purple Mansion’s Gushing Spring Golden Container**\nIn the sixth cycle, the sprout is nurtured to perfection—\nwithin the vessel, jade petals bloom naturally.\nRepeatedly pour mercury, refining within lead—\nsow at dusk, reap at dawn to see the treasure’s bloom.\nIn the furnace, it gleams purple,\ncrystalline and golden, shimmering like rosy clouds.\nKnow that this path is hard for mortals to grasp—\nguard your words, do not boast recklessly.\n\n**Seventh Cycle: Seven-Return Golden Liquid Returned Elixir Container**\nIn the seventh cycle, the elixir completes its return—\ncinnabar nurtured without need for lead.\nFive metals instantly transmute into treasures.\nTo detoxify, bury it in a wellspring.\nA frail man who consumes it will be transformed;\nan old man who takes it will retain youthful countenance.\nIf a hermit in the mountains encounters this,\na single grain will carry him to the ninth heaven.\n\n**Eighth Cycle: Return-to-Origin Divine Liquid Golden Elixir Container**\nThe eighth cycle is called \"Return-to-Origin Divine Liquid.\"\nThe union of yin and yang is a principle hard to fathom.\nNurture cinnabar powder in the furnace—\nafter seven days, when opened, all is yellow.\nInstantly transmute the five metals into supreme treasures.\nA chicken that eats a grain will become a phoenix.\nThe immortals of old left this true method—\nto lightly show it to mortals brings calamity to nine generations.\n\n**Ninth Cycle: Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir Container**\nThe ninth cycle’s elixir is called the \"Great Return.\"\nLong ago, the Eight Elders bestowed it upon Liu An.\nIn secluded caves and grottoes, it startles gods and ghosts,\nits radiance like sunlight, its hues manifold.\nThose of the Dao who consume it gain transformation—\nthe Dark Lord who swallows it treads the cloudy ends.",

Turn: Frost-of-Flying-Flowers Method**\nTake one catty each of realgar, orpiment, and cinnabar.\nRefine each separately, then grind together into a fine powder.\nPlace in an earthen crucible, lining the bottom with half a tael of cinnabar blossom.\nNext, layer the realgar powder, then the orpiment powder, and cover with another half tael of cinnabar blossom.\nSeal tightly to prevent qi from escaping.\nSet upon the Three Terraces and Five Peaks, firing with reeds and reeds for three days and nights.\nCool for one night, then remove—the elixir thus produced can transmute thirty catties of gold.\n\n**Second Turn**\nPlace the previous frost into an earthen crucible, covering it with lead yellow blossom.\nSeal and dry in the shade for ten days, then fire with a gentle flame for three days and nights as before.\nWhen cool, remove—one tael of this elixir can transmute one hundred catties of gold.\n\n**Third Turn**\nCover with white wax *heche*, firing for three days and nights.\nWhen cool, remove—one tael of this elixir can transmute two hundred catties of gold.\n\n**Fourth Turn**\nUse lead-white *heche*, mixing alum powder into the *heche* until it resembles thick mud for sealing.\nSeal and fire for three days and nights as before, then cool and remove.\nOne tael of this elixir can transmute four hundred catties of gold.\n\n**The Method of Drawing Out Reeds**\nGrind together one tael of malachite, two taels of refined saltpeter, one *qian* of borax, and two and a half *qian* of alum.\nHeat *duzhi* oil in a crucible until it boils, then stir in the powdered ingredients until the mixture resembles damp sand.\nPlace a crucible in the furnace and heat until glowing red.\nSpoon the mixture into the crucible until it is seven-tenths full, then cover with a tile.\nHeap coals around it and heat until the mixture liquefies.\nStir with a dry willow branch dozens of times, but do not let it sink to the bottom.\nWhen the saltpeter liquid begins to dry, pour it onto the ground to separate mother and child.\nRemelt in a crucible, then use as desired for transmutation—its texture is exceedingly fine and wondrous.\n\n**The Method of Light Powder**\nGrind together one catty of black alum and half a catty of salt.\nPlace in an earthen jar and boil with prepared liquid until it forms a paste, stirring evenly.\nBoil for half a day until it turns yellow.\nAdd four taels of yellow yeast and one tael of mercury, grinding them together.\nSoon the mercury will spread across the surface.\nSeal with a tile basin and fire to sublimate.\nWhen cool, collect the powder.\n\n**The Method of Powder Frost**\nGrind together half a tael of alum, four taels of white alum, two taels of salt, half a tael of saltpeter, two taels of mercury, and two taels of black alum until no mercury globules remain.\nStir-fry in an iron pan until powdered, then pile into a large bowl.\nCover with wet paper to seal the gaps, then seal with good clay.\nWhen cool, collect the frost.\nTake one tael of the previous frost, grind it with two taels each of salt and alum, and place in a water-and-fire crucible.\nSublimate according to the cinnabar method—this is the final product.\n\n**The Rhapsody on the Supreme-Polarity Divine Cinnabar**\n\nThe divine elixir is not valued by lesser men,\nyet the Jade Emperor bestows its blessings upon the immortals above.\nMoved by the Sage’s compassion,\nhe transmits the secret of divine cinnabar by word of mouth.\n\nCombine two ingredients and stir-fry to form a shape—\nonly then can the treasure be revealed.\nAfter nine turns, when swallowed into the belly,\none instantly ascends to heaven.\n\nOriginally, the Sulfur Lad had forty households,\nyet he sought not the beauty of a sixteen-year-old maiden.\nLacking a master, the two remained bound,\ntheir union dependent on a matchmaker.\n\nThe golden terrace’s candle flame need not be lit,\nwhile the jade pool’s bitter wine is poured again and again.\nThe couple in the flask grow ever more intimate,\nyet the elders in the hall remain displeased.\n\nFrom this, the jade countenance withers—\nonly the harmonizing of the divine medicine can restore it.\nTrue cinnabar takes form,\nfurther refined by civil and martial means.\n\nThe supreme treasure gleams in secret,\nheed not the ugliness of its appearance.\nThe crucible mirrors the Two Modes—\nits firmness and completeness are most wondrous.\n\nTwice prepare a tael of ginger juice,\nthrice seal with half a finger’s weight of clay.\nEnter the bridal chamber—\npound the green-gold powder within,\nseal the mouth’s seams with honey-mixed red halloysite.\nAdd an equal portion of clamshell powder,\nthen seal again with yellow-clay mud,\nbinding tightly with gleaming white iron wire.\n\nWhen striking the plate, be ever attentive.\nWhen nurturing the elixir, remain equally vigilant.\n\nThus, refine the essence of sun and moon,\nharmonizing the principle of Kan and Li.\nPlace the crucible in the furnace,\nbury the flask beneath the earth.\n\nSeal it tightly—\nlet the fire penetrate for one full cycle.\nHeap the coals high—\nlet them rise four fingers’ breadth.\n\nPlace four taels of fire beneath the crucible,\nleaving room for eight parts water within.\nWhen the five metals blaze,\nlisten for the dragon’s chirp and the tiger’s roar.\n\nAfter two days, open it—\nwait until the fire cools and the ashes grow cold.\n\nGenerally, if the cinnabar remains fragmented,\nit may be fired again with added heat.\nOnce its body is firm and hard,\nthen speak of its wondrous, godlike nature.\n\nCut with a knife into pieces the size of soap beans,\nsuspend and boil until the bubbles resemble fish eyes.\nAdd a pinch of lead frost,\nand replenish the fermenting agent frequently.\n\nSteep for a day and night,\nor boil for ten hours.\nRemove from the pouch—\nbathe in hot water.\n\nMoisten slightly on the tongue,\nthen blend with jade nectar.\nCombine with four powders—\nlead-white frost and light powder,\npowder frost and borax in equal parts.\nGrind them exceedingly fine and apply to the entire body.\n\nTen *qian* of divine medicine serve as the child,\nfour taels of the vessel’s mother return to their kin.\nLike planting lotus seeds in order,\nplace them into the golden crucible for repeated warming.\n\nArrange them without letting them touch,\nkeeping each separate in the center.\nCover without exposing,\nburying evenly above and below.\n\nMarvelous! The *Records of the Historian* contains no account,\nyet the immortals transmit the method.\nThe coal burns exquisitely—\nthe pool’s belly grows warm.\nThe charcoal fire nurtures gently—\nthe crucible’s heart heats evenly.\n\nA slight roasting with ash prevents qi from scattering,\nwhile an overturned basin prevents loss.\nThus the count remains unbroken.",

      "translated_text": "Advance in four increments until reaching four taels, seven or eight *qian*, and finally use eight followed by three *qian*. Arrange them according to the four cardinal directions, and after seven days, they will penetrate completely. Keep the chamber tightly sealed to prevent any draft, ensuring the ash remains as pristine as snow. Should the form not yet manifest, do not neglect the teeth’s craving; observe the heart’s cinnabar hue still red. Continue nurturing the fire as scheduled until the bones turn black through and through, and the whole becomes verdant—then success is near.\n\nOnce the true foundation is established, the cinnabar attains its utmost potency. Immerse it in the Flowery Pond for refinement, adjusting the charcoal fire to harmonize. The two stars of lead are ultimately discarded; the inner child of one tael soon finds peace. Only then does yang reach its peak and yin dissipate, revealing the image of the Yellow Flower. As days pass and months flow, the form of the white crane becomes ever clearer. Truly, the mystery is profound beyond mystery, secrecy beyond secrecy.\n\nThis reveals the divine efficacy of transforming treasures, distinct from the oral teachings of the Returned Elixir. When pointing to inner matters, how could it be merely a minor benefit? This Dao, once attained, may only be transmitted to the right person. If bestowed upon the unworthy, heavenly calamity will swiftly follow.\n\n**Divine Cinnabar Secret Formula**\nWondrous is the divine medicine, passed down by the sages of old. It refines sun and moon, gathers yin and yang. With water and fire precisely balanced, as if enduring the passage of stars and frost, powder, borax, and mercury submit—three dragons may be subdued. Golden radiance becomes the medicine, jade trees bear fragrance. Longevity knows no bounds, enduring as heaven and earth.\n\nOnly those with the bones of immortals may deeply guard and conceal it. To transmit it to the unfit is to invite misfortune upon oneself. I have briefly compiled this in the capital, associating with the powerful. Of the two principles of life and destiny, I have glimpsed their essence. Often perusing alchemical classics, this purple text speaks much of the methods of the Yellow and White, the defense of lead and mercury—yet for three thousand years, a thousand attempts and ten thousand failures have yielded no success.\n\nOne day, by fortune, I encountered a master of the highest order, who discoursed on the golden crucible and the divine cinnabar, the supreme medicine. Solitary yin cannot generate; lone yang cannot transform. Yin conceals yang and becomes pregnant; yang embraces yin and takes form. Yin qi produces; yang qi engenders. Since the beginning of time, this qi has been transmitted to the present. When the purest essence resonates, the True One is born. All things arise from the mother; a thousand spirits are transformed by qi. The child grows plump while the mother grows thin; the child grows large while the mother declines. Without birth from the womb of father and mother, nothing exists.\n\nIn making the elixir, one must harmonize the hun of heaven, the po of earth, the essence of metal, the fluid of stone, the bones of the dragon, and the marrow of the phoenix. This is the union of yin and yang, transforming qi with qi, transforming man with man. From womb, egg, moisture, or transformation—whether in mountains, seas, or on land, whether flying, swimming, moving, or growing—all are born through the resonance of qi. The dragon can subdue the tiger; the tiger can tame the dragon. The dragon inhales the tiger’s blood; the tiger absorbs the dragon’s essence. Only through mutual restraint is the Dao of the elixir accomplished.\n\nThe natures of the five metals differ; the origins of the eight stones are profound. A single day’s fire timing seizes a thousand years of creation. Heaven and earth are set within a fleeting moment; dead lead and mercury are transformed in an instant. Refine the crucible, and qi becomes spiritually responsive. Dragon and tiger mate; sun boils and moon surges. Within this wondrous process, what is sown in the morning is reaped by evening. The yang elixir changes the bones; transmutation is divine. The inner elixir can prolong life and extend years; the outer elixir can enable transcendence and ascension. The sacred principle is clear, the celestial mechanism revealed. Fearing the obscurity of immortal traces, I have meticulously recorded the beginning and end.\n\nBefore the twin cypress hall, I chose an auspicious day and hour. Without a single day’s effort, I nurtured a treasure of a thousand years. Without immortal bones, it cannot be achieved; without virtue and power, it cannot be encountered. If not for the long-accumulated blessings of ancestors, how could one ever attain it?\n\n**Lord Lao’s Divine Elixir Formula**\nNo head to the cauldron, no ears to the pot. *Geng* serves as the outer, *Gen* as the inner. No other flavors—just apply directly. Only water and fire are paired. Uprooting the cogongrass is still false; shrinking the *he* is not yet true. To know the truth, there is nothing beyond dead mercury.\n\n**The Great Divine Cinnabar Secret Formula Concludes**\n\n*(Note: The final lines indicate possible missing subtitles, marked as #1 and #2 in the original.)*",
