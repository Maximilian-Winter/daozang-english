  "full_translation": "**The Seven Primordial Perfected Scriptures of the Central Heaven**\n\n*Author unknown. Two scriptures bound as one volume. Source text: \"Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition,\" Zhengyi Section, First Division.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Seven Primordial Perfected Scriptures of the Central Heaven of the Purple Tenuity**\nAt the kalpas when the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning transformed the August Emperors of the Heavens, he governed the Purple Tenuity Central Palace and convened a grand assembly to expound the Dao. At that time, the Lord Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, the host of sagely perfected immortals of the heavens, and the Seven Primordial Perfected Ones were all present at the joyous gathering, listening to the wondrous teachings. The deliverance of all beings was proclaimed, and the recitation of the cavernous verses radiated boundless light, illuminating the ten directions—above in the heavens and below on earth.\n\nYet in the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, within the Five Paths and Eight Gates, the exiled and the condemned, the hungry ghosts and destitute souls, endured all manner of suffering, bound in the Black Prison of the Northern Celestial One. By contrast, the heavenly paradises of the ten directions, the numinous abodes of immortals, the perfected and divine beings, and the sagely hosts who had attained the Dao—all enjoyed natural sustenance, carefree and blissful.\n\nThe Lord Emperor bowed his head and addressed the Celestial Worthy: \"Today’s joyous assembly is ineffably wondrous. We have witnessed the heavens and hells, the disparity between suffering and joy, the differences in longevity and early death, poverty and prosperity, nobility and lowliness. We beseech your instruction, that all may clearly understand.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: \"Since I established heaven and earth, countless kalpas have passed. Yet in the lower mortal world, simplicity has waned and purity dispersed. Deluded thoughts bind them, the Ten Evils entangle, the Six Bandits occupy their hearts, and the Four Serpents lurk in their lungs. In their movements and repose, they neglect their bearing. They curse, slander, flatter, and form cliques. Disloyal and unfilial, unloving and unkind, unrighteous and unbenevolent, they indulge in greed and excessive taking. Thus, the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens secretly seize their essence and souls, while the Five Dipper Stars hasten the reckoning of their lifespans. Not only do they fail to attain longevity and enduring vision, but they also sink into the realms of hungry ghosts and beasts.\n\nYou, the Seven Perfected Ones, if you wish to bestow grace and salvation, must uphold my laws and ordinances. On the third, fifteenth, and twenty-seventh days of each month, descend to the mortal realm to inspect, examine, and assess merits and transgressions. Investigate right and wrong, broadly expound the luminous might, and widely proclaim the teachings and precepts.\"\n\nThereupon, the Lord Emperor commanded the Seven Primordial Perfected Lords to weave the Dipper’s handle and spread its net, its pointer fiercely directed, aiding the Celestial Pass. He composed a hymn, saying:\n\n*The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,*\n*Summons the Master of the Central Heaven.*\n*Inspects the merits and transgressions of mortals,*\n*Rewarding good and evil karmic ties.*\n*The Black Book commands execution,*\n*Not a hair’s breadth shows partiality.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Seven Primordial Perfected Lords’ Incantations**\n\n**1. The Yang Brightness Perfected Lord of the Pivot Star’s Longevity Incantation**\nThe Northern Dipper extends life,\nReturning to the Fourfold Luminosity.\nIts flowing radiance shines below,\nNaturally resplendent and wondrous.\nThe Seven Primordials record the register,\nFirmly attending the numinous body.\nThe spirit records the name,\nThe Supreme Mystery guards the form.\nSoul and spirit endure forever,\nEars and eyes know no fright.\nGathering protection to sustain life,\nThe Terrace Perfected flows and moves.\nPreserving the true and natural,\nAscending to the Jade Capital.\n\n**2. The Yin Essence Perfected Lord of the Revolving Star’s Deliverance-from-Calamity Incantation**\nThe Northern Dipper delivers from calamity,\nLofty perfected, numinous immortals.\nFlowing light shines and reflects,\nProtecting and sustaining life.\nThe Seven Primordials guard the register,\nNaturally attaining long extension.\nDispelling hardship and peril,\nShifting and removing disasters.\nThe viscera and bowels open and brighten,\nWithin and without, no transgressions.\nLight moves in harmony with the luminous,\nJoining with the spirits in union.\nRefining and transforming naturally,\nAscending to the Jade Mystery.\n\n**3. The Perfected Lord of the Mechanism Star’s Life-Protection Incantation**\nThe Northern Dipper protects life,\nLofty numinosity disperses the spirits.\nThe upright *qi* gathers and subdues,\nAttending and guarding the honored guest.\nThe Seven Primordials inscribe the upper register,\nConveying the attainment of the mysterious and true.\nFlowing and evolving numinous brightness,\nHarmonizing the body in shared communion.\nForever repelling the inauspicious,\nInwardly guarding the form and body.\nErasing death and ascending to life,\nSpreading and arranging with the spirits.\nPreserving and elevating naturally,\nAscending to the Jade Dawn.\n\n**4. The Mysterious Darkness Perfected Lord of the Authority Star’s Lifespan-Extending Incantation**\nThe Northern Dipper extends lifespan,\nFlowing truth disperses and spreads.\nLight shines below in protection,\nAiding the form in shared support.\nThe Seven Primordials deliver the register,\nTogether resplendent with the Mysterious Origin.\nPacifying and guarding the spirit,\nProtecting the form and frame.\nMight and spirit can be guarded,\nThe true and numinous ride the floating.\nBright vision within and without,\nJoining with the spirits in unity.\nPreserving and refining naturally,\nAscending to the Jade Void.\n\n**5. The Cinnabar Origin Perfected Lord of the Balance Star’s Disaster-Dispelling Incantation**\nThe Northern Dipper dispels disaster,\nThe Fourfold Luminosity opens the yang.\nThe upper numinosity disperses the mysterious,\nCavernously reflecting the divine light.\nThe Seven Primordials guard the register,\nThe Controller of Fate extends prosperity.\nBrightly inscribing the name above,\nCausing me to extend and lengthen.\nPreserving and fortifying body and life,\nRemoving misfortune and banishing calamity.\nThe divine and true emit might,\nFlowing and evolving through the cavernous realm.\nOvercoming and carrying naturally,\nAscending to the Jade Hall.\n\n**6. The Northern Culmen Perfected Lord of the Opening Yang Star’s Calamity-Dispersing Incantation**\nThe Northern Dipper disperses calamity,\nThe mysterious shines and removes misfortune.\nThe Three Lights resplendently illuminate,\nThe myriad *qi* flow and circulate.\nThe Seven Primordials preside over the register,\nArrayed in the Dipper’s midst.\nInspecting the body and protecting life,\nDisasters □ are not encountered.\nThe August Supreme preserves the true,\nLife and emolument know no end.\nThe upright Dao attains long life,\nJoining with the spirits without limit.\nPreserving the form naturally,\nAscending to the Jade Palace.\n\n**7. The Heavenly Pass Perfected Lord of the Shimmering Star’s Decline-Supporting Incantation**\nThe Northern Dipper supports decline,\nConveying the attainment of spirit and essence.\nThe Southern Controller preserves life,\nExtending longevity and the bodily form.\nThe Seven Primordials govern the register,\nThe numinous and true cultivate the name.\nArrayed in the upper offices,\nJoining in celebration and union.\nCinnabar numinosity disperses light,\nCavernously entering the mysterious darkness.\nSoaring through the heavens and flying,\nJoining with the spirits in numinous unity.\nPreserving me naturally,\nAscending to the Jade Court.\n\n---\n\nThe Celestial Worthy addressed the Lord Emperor of the Purple Tenuity and the Seven Primordial Perfected Lords: \"If you seek long life and enduring vision, to dispel disasters and escape calamities, extend lifespan and prolong years, and absolve transgressions, you may follow my teachings. In a separate chamber, make offerings, burn incense, light lamps, and recite and transmit the scriptures. The host of perfected ones will descend together, demonic essences will be subdued and vanquished, inauspicious omens will be severed and extinguished, past lives will transcend and be reborn, the Nine Dark Realms will cease their opposition, and the living will obtain blessings. Forever in harmony with profit and uprightness, emoluments and ranks will ascend, households will flourish, rulers and ministers will be at peace, and the world will know harmony.\"\n\n**The Seven Primordial Perfected Scriptures of the Central Heaven of the Purple Tenuity concludes.**",
