  "full_translation": "**Translation:**\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Its Power)**\n*Title:* **Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing***. An anonymous commentary. Three volumes: upper, middle, and lower.\n*Source of the base text:* The *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), in the *Dongshen* (Cave Spirits) section under the *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category.\n*Note:* The annotations in this book’s lower volume are identical to those in the lower volume of Shi Yong’s *Complete Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing***.\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing***\nThe Sage knows that the divine treasury is tranquil and obscure,\nthe Dao lies in the distant and unfathomable.\nIt permeates the Six Vacuities,\nyet none can truly grasp its nature.\nIt responds to myriad transformations,\nyet who dares to fathom its traces?\n\nThen it is ever-present yet seemingly void—\nthe One going, the One coming, while remaining fundamentally empty.\nIt is ever-creative yet ever-transforming—\nthe One forming, the One manifesting, while remaining fundamentally true.\nHow could there be words to engage in idle debate?\n\nThe Sage remains silent and reflects upon it,\nyet even the most enlightened minds, when aligned with common sentiment, are bound by folly—\nthey must be guided before they move.\nEven the most refined natures, when clouded by ignorance, must be instructed before they awaken.\nThus, the Sage has spoken through the square-bound volumes,\ntransmitting it to the immortal ages,\nas a remedy for eternal goodness.\n\nAcross the span of a thousand years,\nthe Dao has grown ever more distant.\nThe intent of the ancient Sage\nis lost to those who are dim-witted;\nthe utter truth of his words\nis incomprehensible to the foolish.\n\nNow, consider the writings of my venerable Lord Lao:\nHis words are clear yet his meaning profound,\nhis text simple yet his purpose subtle.\nIf not elucidated and its significance clarified,\nthe common people will regard it as distant as the heavens,\nunable to discern it as vividly as crimson and emerald.\n\nThus, I now undertake this commentary to reveal the great Dao,\nhaving reached the dusty world through practice and transformation.\nPerhaps this may serve as a guiding light.\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing*, Volume One**\nAn anonymous commentary.\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.\nTo give life and take it in due season—this is the Dao of things;\nTo cultivate virtue and deeds—this is the Dao of humanity;\nTo distinguish male and female—this is the Dao of the family;\nTo establish laws and measures—this is the Dao of the state.\nThese are the Constant Dao of the world,\nShared by both Sage and commoner alike.\n\nYet the Dao that can be spoken of—\nResponsive without hindrance, boundless in its transformations,\nNeither ear nor eye can grasp its subtle essence:\nTo perceive its faintest traces is to fathom its divine metamorphosis;\nTo know its farthest reach is to penetrate its unfathomable truth.\nIn motion, it responds to ten thousand affairs;\nIn stillness, it does not stagnate in one form—\nHow could the Constant Dao ever be thus?\n\nThe Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\nThe Eternal Name does not cling to form—\nFor form has cycles of flourishing and decline;\nThe Eternal Name does not reside in numbers—\nFor numbers have limits and must change.\nThus, the Name that can be named cannot be seized,\nCannot be mirrored in likeness,\nCannot be followed to see its beginning or end—\nPierced from above or below, it remains firm,\nIts height beyond reach.\nIt does not conform to things yet remains fixed,\nIts substance is functional,\nExisting in the Constant Non-being,\nIn harmony with the Dao—\nAnd thus the Name arises, yet it is not the Eternal Name.\n\nNon-being is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nBeing is the mother of ten thousand things.\nBefore the Dao was distinguished,\nNeither yin nor yang could be spoken of,\nNor could creation and transformation be traced.\nWhen *qi* settled in clarity, it became Heaven;\nWhen *qi* settled in turbidity, it became Earth.\nHeaven and Earth, in their dual attainment,\nCalled clarity *yang*—the power to create—\nAnd turbidity *yin*—the power to transform—\nThus all things are born.\n\nIn Non-being, the Dao stands alone, and Heaven and Earth attain it—\nThis is why Non-being is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nIn Being, Heaven and Earth unite, and all things are born—\nThis is why Being is the mother of ten thousand things.\nAt the beginning, it is spoken of as *qi*;\nAs the mother, it is spoken of as form—\n*Qi* and form—\nAlso the Dao’s Being and Non-being.\n\nTo observe its mystery, one must hold fast to Non-being;\nTo observe its limits, one must hold fast to Being.\nThese two, though differing in name, arise from the same source—\nBoth called *Xuan* (the Profound).\nThe Profound, again the Profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\nIt comes indistinctly—from where does it come?\nIt departs indistinctly—where does it go?\nEmpty, yet not lodged in any single thing;\nVoid, yet not reflected in any single form—\nThis is the Constant Non-being.\n\nIt comes indistinctly—yet its coming must have a manifestation;\nIt departs indistinctly—yet its departure must have a substance.\nEmpty, yet the spirit gathers within it—\nMotionless yet moving.\nVoid, yet the True is contained—\nUnchanging yet transforming—\nThis is the Constant Being.\n\nConstant Non-being is the practice of *wuwei* (non-action);\nConstant Being is the cultivation of action.\nNon-action leads to the Mysterious,\nAction leads to the Manifest—\nThese two, though differing in name, arise from the same source.\n\nIn essence, can they not both be called *Xuan*?\nFor *Xuan* is the Dao made visible—\nLike the sky’s hue, seen yet its nature unknown.\nThe Profound, again the Profound—\nTo attain it again and again,\nAnd to penetrate it ever deeper—\nThus it is called the gateway to all mysteries,\nFor it enters and exits the Great Dao.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nThen wickedness arises.\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low contrast each other,\nHarmony and discord blend,\nBefore and after follow.\nThe Dao disperses through affairs,\nThings intermingle in nature.\nAt first, they receive the True,\nYet humanity corrupts it into falseness;\nAt first, they inherit harmony,\nYet it becomes discordant.\nThus, what was once beautiful becomes ugly,\nWhat was once good becomes ungood—\nThe two paths of beauty and ugliness,\nGoodness and ungoodness, diverge.\n\nThe Sage does not, because of ugliness, cease to recognize beauty,\nNor, because of ungoodness, cease to recognize goodness—\nOnly to fulfill their nature,\nNot to follow the common crowd in distinguishing beauty from ugliness,\nGoodness from ungoodness.\nIf one seeks to unify them,\nThen nature attains its utmost—\nAnd what of being and non-being,\nDifficulty and ease,\nLong and short,\nHigh and low,\nHarmony and discord,\nBefore and after?\nThis is the Sage’s teaching,\nAnd thus it is practiced.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in non-action,\nTeaches through non-speech.\nThe Sage governs himself with the Dao,\nAnd bestows deeds upon others.\nFor those without foresight,\nThey await the Sage to think for them;\nFor those without insight,\nThey await the Sage to see for them.\nIf not guided by teaching,\nThey grow soft and drown themselves,\nFoolish and weaken themselves,\nUnable to follow the Sage’s Dao.\n\nI store my spirit in profound silence,\nYet let them move with the wind’s influence;\nI dwell in still contemplation,\nYet let them act in response to transformation.\nTo ponder affairs exhausts one’s clarity—\nI have no affairs;\nTo speak much disrupts the True thread—\nI speak not.\nNaturally, affairs are accomplished below,\nTeaching established above—\nAnd though the people are not commanded, they act in harmony,\nFor there is no reversal of the Dao.\n\nAll things act without complaint,\nThe Sage emerges, and all things emerge;\nThe Sage withdraws, and all things withdraw.\nThe Sage is what all things behold.\nThus, when the Sage is above,\nAll things flourish yet each fulfills its nature,\nWithout blame for losing their essence.\nFor I do not exert my mind—\nOnly to follow the natural order of things,\nUntil rise and fall have no words to describe them.\n\nIf governance is unrefined,\nIf teaching is unclear,\nThen the Sage must emerge and withdraw,\nMust take and give as needed—\nDisturbing the hearts of all under Heaven,\nDisordering the forms of all things.\nEven then, though acting, there is no complaint.\n\nThe myriad things act without complaint,\nYet this too awaits the Sage’s age.\n\nBorn yet not possessed,\nActing yet not relying,\nAccomplished yet not dwelling—\nOnly because one does not dwell does one not depart.\n\nThe Great Dao’s establishment\ndoes not divide by self and other,\nnor by high and low,\nbut through mind reaching mind,\nthe hearts of all under Heaven become my heart;\nthrough form nourishing form,\nthe shapes of all things become my form—\nthen what need is there for divided intent?\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao to aid all things,\nbends himself to await others,\nconceals my skill to remedy their clumsiness,\nextends my ability to guide their vulgarity—\nthus his deeds reach the boundless,\nhis achievements become sublime,\nfixed as they cannot be surpassed.\n\nThe Sage fears excess and overflow,\nso he restrains it;\nfears fullness and loss,\nso he diminishes it.\nGreat and pervasive, yet not self-satisfied,\nwondrous and unfathomable, yet not self-deified—\nborn yet not born,\nacting yet not acting,\nachieving yet not claiming achievement—\nthus things cannot displace me,\ntimes cannot shift me,\nand I abide in the Dao—\nhence I do not depart.\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**\n\nNot exalting the virtuous, so the people do not contend;\nNot treasuring rare goods, so the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not乱 (*luan*—be disordered).\nThus the Sage’s governance:\nempties the mind, fills the belly,\nweakens the will, strengthens the bones.\nEver keeping the people in ignorance and without desire,\nso that even the wise dare not act.\n\nActing without acting—\nthen nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nBy nature, distinctions are none,\nyet habit shifts them;\nby nature, things are one,\nyet emotion divides them.\nHabit alters nature, so the virtuous are ever what others emulate;\nemotion divides things, so rare goods are ever what others seek.\nTo emulate the virtuous yet fall short—\nthis only breeds contention.\nTo seek goods yet lack them—\nthis only breeds theft.\nThese two things cause the people to lose their nature and act in vain knowledge,\nto nurture emotion and indulge in false desires—\nhow then can they see my Dao?\n\nBetter to keep their hearts empty—\nso virtue and vulgarity do not linger within,\nand self and other are undivided;\ntheir bellies filled with abundance,\nso finery does not tempt without,\nand clothing and food suffice;\ntheir will weakened, to soften themselves and not vie with others;\ntheir bones strengthened, to stand firm and not indulge in worldly gain.\n\nThus, when the people of the world have no false knowledge to see by,\nand the people of the world have no frivolous desires to seek,\nthen the Sage’s actions will leave nothing ungoverned.\n\nTherefore, the chapter *\"Not Exalting the Virtuous\"* restores human nature,\nreverses the ways of things,\nand takes root in the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao is Void Yet Applied**\n\nThe Dao is void yet applied—\nsometimes it does not fill.\n\nWhen the Dao expands, it suffices the four quarters yet is not full;\nwhen the Dao contracts, it hides in the minutest things yet is not minute.\n\nIn essence, it attains supreme emptiness—\nall that comes to it finds response.\nIn application, it attains supreme transformation—\nall that arrives finds reception.\n\nIt does not tower too high—\nfor the low cannot reach it;\nit does not stoop too low—\nfor the high cannot descend to it.\nThus, not only does it not fill,\nbut it also does not endure long—\nunless one abides in the balance of yin and yang,\nhow could this be possible?\n\nHence it is said:\n*The Dao is void yet applied—\nsometimes it does not fill.*\n\nVoidness means the balance of yin and yang,\nfree from excess or deficiency.\n\nProfound, it seems the origin of all things.\nDeep and unfathomable—this is called *profound*;\nsubtle and inexhaustible—this is called *Dao*.\n\nWhen the Dao is absent, heaven and earth take it as their beginning;\nwhen the Dao is present, all things take it as their mother.\nSpeak of it as mother, and one knows all things arise from the Dao;\nspeak of it as origin, and one knows all things derive from the Dao.\nYet if it is their origin, why say it *seems* so?\nFor the Dao has no form—\nit cannot be defined by a fixed body,\nthus it is said: *Profound, it seems the origin of all things.*\n\nBlunt its sharpness, resolve its entanglements,\nsoften its brilliance, harmonize with its dust—\nserene, it seems to exist.\n\nWhen one abides in the Dao,\nrestraining the mind’s wildness in emptiness,\nsettling the nature’s source in stillness,\nconcealing joy and anger in the realm of non-doing,\nlocking likes and dislikes in the land of non-thought,\nthen one dwells in simplicity within oneself,\nand meets things with tranquility.\n\nNot displaying clarity outwardly,\nit harmonizes yet seems obscure;\nnot standing apart from the crowd,\nit unifies yet seems foolish.\n\nThus, in the Dao,\none sees without looking,\naccomplishes without acting,\nand bears no burden of things.\n\nIf one does not blunt its sharpness and instead relies solely on intention,\none will surely grow light and injure one’s nature;\nif one does not resolve its entanglements and instead relies solely on affairs,\none will surely be troubled and disrupt one’s true essence;\nif one does not soften its brilliance, the Dao will fail through arrogance;\nif one does not harmonize with its dust, reputation will fail through arrogance.\n\nThus, in the Dao,\none looks yet does not see,\nacts yet does not accomplish,\nand is always burdened by things—\nthose who study it should not be negligent!\n\nThis is why, after the four practices,\nit is followed by: *Serene, it seems to exist.*\n\nThe Dao has no fixed form—\nif one speaks of it merely as *existing*,\nit is not the Dao,\nthus it is said *seems to exist*.\n\nI do not know whose child I am—\nI precede the Sovereign of the Primordial.\n\nObserving the Dao’s origin,\nit arises from non-action,\nis born of purity and stillness,\nis held onto and preserved,\nabandoned and lost.\nIt does not forcefully multiply,\nnor does it weakly diminish—\nthus, it attains the utmost of emptiness,\nthe marvel of true constancy.\nThough heaven and earth take me as their beginning,\nthough all things take me as their origin,\nI manifest in the unfathomable,\nI probe what has no precedence—\nthat is the image of form.\nI dwell in the initial state of formlessness,\nI reside above the realm of things—\nhow could I be named as a child?\nThus it is said: *I do not know whose child I am—\nI precede the Sovereign of the Primordial.*\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\n\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—\nthey treat all things as sacrificial straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not benevolent—\nthey treat the people as sacrificial straw dogs.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nit is like a bellows, is it not?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever producing.\n\nHeaven and earth, toward all things,\nlet their natural order take its course.\nWhen their time to live comes, they give life,\nnourishing them with dew and rain;\nwhen their time to die comes, they bring death,\nwithering them through frost and snow.\nThus, they are not bound to any single thing,\nnor burdened by any single time—\nthey simply await the unfolding of their nature.\n\nThey are called *straw dogs* because,\nwhen sacrifices are made,\nthey are offered with utmost sincerity and reverence.\nBut once the rites are over,\nthey are discarded as worthless—\ntreated like dung and filth.\nThis is not about loving them more at first and less at the end,\nnor cherishing them before and hating them after—\nit is simply the way of their nature.\n\nThe Sage’s relation to the people is no different.\nWhen love is given, it is like cherishing an infant;\nwhen respect is given, it is like receiving a grand sacrifice—\nno love is greater than this.\n\nBut when there are those not loved,\npunishment is meted out to display authority,\nand life is regarded as trivial.\nWhen there are those not respected,\nexecutions are carried out to eliminate guilt,\nand existence is seen as insignificant—\nthis is not the Sage’s sentiment toward rewards and punishments,\nbut rather the natural unfolding of their order,\nin harmony with heaven and earth.\n\nIf it were otherwise,\nhow could one receive all things without exhaustion,\nor embrace all changes without drowning?\n\nTo love life is to give life without depletion;\nto desire goodness is to foster goodness without end.\nIts responses are boundless,\nits emergence inexhaustible—\nlike the bellows, ever producing.\nThus it is said: *Empty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever producing.*\n\nMany words lead to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold to the center.\n\nThe Sage acts by applying the Dao,\nand remains still by embodying the Dao.\nIn stillness, they align with the Dao,\nserene and self-nourishing,\nnot engaging with affairs,\nnot interfacing with things—\nwhat harm could words bring?\n\nWhen they act and apply the Dao,\nno words suffice to meet the changes—\nthen the Dao reaches its limits.\nThough words may be praised,\nthey must be concise to fit the principle,\nessential to align with the Dao,\nnot indulging in excess for its own sake.\nThus it is said: *Many words lead to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold to the center.*\nIs this not the way?\n\n**Chapter Six: The Unending Valley Spirit**\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Feminine.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Feminine\nis called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEndless as silk, yet ever present,\nits use requires no toil.\nEmpty yet responsive—\nits response is boundless;\nwondrous yet unfathomable—\nits measure has no bounds.\n\nFor the Valley is that which responds to all things\nyet clings to none.\nThe Spirit is that which receives all transformations\nyet lingers in no origin.\n\nNot clinging to any thing,\nits emptiness never fills—\nwhat loss could there be?\nNot lingering in any origin,\nits transformation never exhausts—\nwhat end could there be?\n\nThus the Valley Spirit bears the sign of immortality—\nthis is called the Mysterious Feminine.\n\nThe Dao in its relation to humanity\nbegins with the formless and ends with the formed.\nThe formless is spoken of as *qi*,\nthe formed is illustrated by shape.\nThe Mysterious Feminine is the formed aspect of this.\n\nWithin the human body, the Mysterious Feminine is the source of life.\nEmpty, it responds to our movements;\nwondrous, it perfects our transformations.\nThat which descends returns through it,\nthat which departs returns through it.\nThus the vital *qi* flows unbroken,\nthe true essence remains tranquil—\nand the principle of longevity is realized.\n\nYet why cannot humanity live?\nNot because the Mysterious Feminine is lacking—\nbut because humanity cannot be empty and still.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven’s Duration, Earth’s Longevity**\n\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nHeaven and Earth endure and persist\nbecause they do not generate themselves—\nthus they attain eternal life.\n\nTherefore the Sage places his body last\nand yet his body is first;\nsets his body aside\nand yet his body is preserved.\nIs this not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his own nature.\n\nHis essence is supremely high—\nhe aids all living beings yet claims none.\nThis is how Heaven endures.\nHis nature is vast and thick—\nhe bears all things yet does not refuse.\nThis is how Earth persists.\n\nHeaven endures, covering all ages without tipping;\nEarth persists, bearing past and present without sinking.\nThis is not because Heaven and Earth inherently endure and persist—\nrather, they do not claim their own life,\nand thus endure naturally.\n\nThe Sage embodies Heaven and Earth,\naspires to eternal life—\nhow could he dare claim his own body?\nThus he lowers himself to the lowly,\nharmonizes his brilliance with the common,\nthough knowing he is first,\nhe does not dare to lead others\nbut always remains behind.\nThough his body is sage,\nhe does not dare to surpass others\nbut always conceals his traces.\nThus he places his body last and yet his body is first;\nsets his body aside and yet his body is preserved.\nTherefore he fulfills his own nature\nand aligns with Heaven and Earth’s enduring longevity.\n\nIf not for this selflessness,\nhow could one speak of this?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water**\n\nThe supreme good is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend—\nit dwells where others disdain,\nand thus approaches the Dao.\n\nIt rests in lowly places,\nits heart is deep,\nits giving is kind,\nits words are trustworthy,\nits governance is effective,\nits actions are capable,\nits movements are timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend\ndoes it incur no blame.\n\nIn the past, the Dao was above—\nindistinct yet without form,\nwithout distinction,\nyet its purity was undefiled.\nWhen it separated from the formless and entered the formed,\nin terms of nature, goodness remained;\nin terms of the Five Phases, water emerged—\nand goodness and water thus drew near to the Dao.\nThis is why they are compared and established,\nhence it is said: *The supreme good is like water.*\n\nGoodness is called nature—\nforgetting the mind and entering stillness,\nclearing oneself to benefit others,\nhiding the roots of contention,\nas if it were inherent—\nno taking, no giving,\nas if natural.\nWhen sought, it responds,\nyet does not respond to frivolous seeking.\nWhen still, it gradually clears,\nyet does not clear through forced stillness.\nDeep in its own understanding,\nbright yet guarding obscurity,\nit reaches the benevolence of aiding others,\nthe certainty of trust,\nthe governance of following principle,\nthe capability of adapting to change—\nall are the unifying work of water.\n\nIn essence, this chapter conveys\nthe meaning of *upper virtue not being virtue*,\n*upper worthies having no contention*.\n\nFor instance:\nTo rest in lowly places—\none must descend to the low.\nA heart that is deep—\nwater deepens and flows back.\nGiving that is kind—\nbenefiting all things.\nWords that are trustworthy—\nnot deceiving others externally.\nGovernance that is effective—\ngrasping softness to overcome hardness.\nActions that are capable—\nferrying all with boats and oars.\nMovements that are timely—\nacting when it should, stopping when it should.\n\nAll these virtues—\nif one clings to them and strives to surpass others,\none is bound to incur blame.\nHow could one then approach the Dao?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: Filling to the Brim**\n\nFilling to the brim\nis not as good as stopping in time;\nsharpening to a point\ncannot be long preserved.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nwhen measured, it is never exhausted;\nwhen poured, it never overflows.\nNo lack makes it insufficient,\nno excess makes it redundant.\nAll is emptied within to avoid fullness,\nhollowed within to receive things—\nwhy cling to fullness as if it were restraint?\n\nIf one clings to fullness,\nit is better to stop in time.\nThe affairs of the world\ncome and go in cycles,\nnew replacing old,\ntheir appearances and disappearances too numerous to count,\ntheir benefits and harms too mixed to calculate with intelligence.\n\nIf one strains the heart to respond to endless affairs,\nexhausts thought to await irregular things—\neven with the cleverness of measuring,\nthe sharpness of honing,\nthere will still be a time of depletion.\n\nThose who follow the Dao are not thus.\nThey abandon worldly entanglements in affairs,\npreserve their true nature in non-action—\nthen what they enjoy\nendures in preservation.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nyet none can guard them;\nwealth and honor lead to arrogance,\nand one brings ruin upon oneself.\n\nViewing things through the Dao,\nthe Dao is true, things are false;\nviewing things through virtue,\nvirtue is enduring, things are fleeting.\n\nThe Perfect One nourishes virtue with the Dao,\nrefines the Dao with virtue,\nand always stands above all things,\nfinding joy in virtue and the Dao.\nKnowing all things are false,\nthey merely weary the mind—\nwhat is gold and jade,\nif viewed by the Perfect One,\nbut borrowed things?\nWhy treasure them?\n\n「If one treasures them, how can there be no calamity? When achievement is complete and reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven. The seasons cannot always be in motion; when they move, there must be a pause. Affairs cannot always flourish; when they rise, there must be decline. Yet human advancement and retreat have their proper *yì* (義), which can be followed but not defied; departure and approach follow one’s *mìng* (命), which can be aligned with but not contradicted. If one can retreat when *yì* demands it yet advances against *yì*, harm will surely follow. If one can depart when *mìng* requires it yet clings to what *mìng* rejects, loss will surely come. How can one rely on advancement to secure lifelong honor, yet ignore the specter of sorrow and misfortune? This is the way of achievement complete, reputation fulfilled, and withdrawal—Heaven’s Dao.\n\n**Chapter 10: On Nourishing the Vital Essence and Embracing Oneness**\nCan one nourish the vital essence and embrace oneness without separation?\nSince receiving one’s *mìng* (命), the Perfect One preserves their *shén* (神) afterward. Within one body, yin and yang are complete; in the four great elements, creation and transformation are whole. Their nature attains the harmony of *érchōng* (爾沖), and their *qì* (氣) returns to its true and authentic essence. What then is the harm of external things?\nThis is the principle of life.\n\nYet when the *shén* (神) follows change and transformation, thoughts arise from things, desires sprout in the chest, and toil lingers within the body. The harmony they once held shifts to discord, and the true essence becomes perverted into falsehood. Then the *shén* (神) is seized by the *pò* (魄), unable to nourish it, and thus disperses and scatters, failing to preserve itself—this is the way of death.\n\nThe Perfect One knows this to be so. They forget worldly concerns, extinguish the dusty mind, and recognize that the *shén* (神) is their sovereign. Thus, they remain tranquil and undisturbed, reaching clarity. Knowing that the vital essence is their foundation, they stay at peace and unshaken, attaining oneness. Only then does their *shén* (神) penetrate to the numinous and not be deceived, their vital essence preserved in authenticity and becoming dual—internally free from the *pò* (魄)’s burden, externally free from things’ sway. Then the Dao will not soon perish.\n\nAlas, the foolish and ignorant! They turn their backs on yang and face yin, extinguish the *shén* (神) and submit to the *pò* (魄), racing through endless change and labor, yet failing to guard the Perfect One’s vital essence. When death comes, they sink into the yin Dao, falling into the realm of *yìshēng* (異生). This is because they are burdened by the *pò* (魄) yet cannot embrace oneness to preserve themselves. How lamentable! How lamentable!\n\n**Chapter 11: On Concentrating the Vital Essence and Attaining Softness**\nCan one concentrate the vital essence to attain softness like an infant?\nHumans preserve life by nourishing their *qì* (氣); they hasten death by depleting their *qì* (氣).\nThe noble does not harm life by harming others, so they concentrate the vital essence to attain softness, preserving their true nature.\n\nMoreover, the Perfect One’s nature is accustomed to stillness; movement brings sorrow and joy. The Perfect One’s nature is content with non-contradiction; contradiction sparks violent rage. Sorrow and joy arise, and the emotions within become disordered; violent rage stirs, and the *qì* (氣) within becomes agitated. Such is the way of those who fail to nourish the true.\n\nHow then does one concentrate the vital essence to attain softness?\nNothing surpasses directing it with the will, guiding it with the *shén* (神), keeping the heart in purity and tranquility, and focusing the will on emptiness and ease. Binding the five thieves in the land of no attachment, imprisoning *wúmíng* (無明) in the realm of utter weakness—only then does the *qì* (氣) align with softness and remain unmoved by external stimuli. What else could this be but the state of an infant?\n\n**Chapter 12: On Purifying and Illuminating the Mysterious**\nCan one purify and illuminate without flaw?\nThe nature has its filth, which can be cleansed; the nature has its impurities, which can be removed.\nUnless one cultivates purity to nourish themselves and stillness to face things, how could this be?\n\n**Chapter 13: On Loving the People and Governing the State**\nCan one love the people and govern the state without action?\nGovernance rooted in non-action (*wúwéi* 無為) spawns falsehood from contrivance (*yǒuzuò* 有作). When humans stray from their nature, they lose their foundation; when enslaved by things, they lose themselves.\nTo love the people and preserve life, to govern the state and maintain lasting peace, nothing surpasses letting them dwell in their nature and not act.\n\n**Chapter 14: On the Opening and Closing of the Heavenly Gate**\nCan one act as the feminine in the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate?\nAll things enter and exit through Heaven’s gate; Heaven’s gate opens and closes through the Dao.\nThe Perfect One responds to Heaven’s gate, entering and exiting the mysterious realm, traversing the Dao’s threshold while ascending and descending in the true world. They harmonize with the ebb and flow of time, aligning with things’ waxing and waning—not through arbitrary action, but by dwelling in heartless stillness.\n\n**Chapter 15: On Clarity and Fourfold Reach**\nCan one be clear and fourfold without knowing?\nTo illuminate the hidden is clarity; to perceive the unadorned is whiteness; to flow unrestricted is fourfold reach. Such is true knowing.\nYet knowing while not knowing—this is the utmost.\n\n**Chapter 16: On Nurturing and Tending**\nTo nurture and tend—giving birth without possession, acting without reliance—\nthe Dao has its creative force, by which all things are born;\nthe Dao has its transformative power, by which all things are sustained.\nYet the Dao can nurture and tend to all things only if one truly comprehends it. Otherwise, it cannot be imitated.\n\n**Chapter 17: On the Long and the Unharmed**\nTo grow long without slaughter—this is called the mysterious *dé* (德).\nTo endure for ten thousand generations without wear—this is the Dao. Is it not long?\nNon-action yet all things transform—is this not without slaughter?\n\n**Chapter 18: On the Thirty Spokes and the Single Hub**\nThree hundred spokes converge at a single hub; when the hub is absent, the wheel’s use remains. Clay is molded into vessels; when the void is absent, the vessel’s utility is lost. Doors and windows are carved for rooms; when the void is absent, the room’s stability is gone. Thus, the presence of things brings utility, but the void brings true use.\n\nThe wheel has the principle of movement and turning yet does not cling to matter; vessels have the name of gathering yet do not scatter outward; rooms are the constant dwelling place and achieve inner tranquility. These are but examples of the use of the void.\n\nMoreover, what exists beyond form is called the Dao; what exists below form is called things.\nWhen the Dao is beyond form, non-action is its use—its use is boundless, and there is no depletion from new or old.\nWhen things are below form, their presence brings utility—yet utility is finite, and they incur blame from rise and fall.\nThis is why, speaking of the wheel, the absence of the hub yields the wheel’s use; speaking of vessels, the absence of the void yields their utility; speaking of rooms, the absence of the void yields their stability.»\n\nThe Mysterious Dao Explained\n\nIf we speak of the profound, then the one that circulates my *qi* is the **Hé Chē** (River Wheel), the one that gathers my *zhēn* (true essence) is the **Dǐng Qì** (Crucible Vessel), and the one that houses my spirit is the **Jiàng Shì** (Vermilion Chamber). These three—how are they truly used? They are employed through *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five flavors dull the palate. The true essence does not fail to preserve itself within, and nature does not fail to return to its origin—yet the reason it cannot is that it is constantly seduced by external things.\n\nThe eyes fix upon sight, yet I would use wisdom to perceive its true color—yet I do not see, for the colors of things blind me. The ears fix upon sound, yet I would use steadfastness to hear its true voice—yet I do not hear, for the sounds of things deafen me. The mouth fixates upon taste, yet I would use utmost simplicity to know its true flavor—yet I do not know, for the flavors of things dull me.\n\nWhen the eyes reach blindness and close wisdom’s gaze, when the ears reach deafness and shatter steadfastness, when the mouth reaches dullness and cannot dwell in simplicity, the nine perversions arise, and the true essence is lost. Thus, the common man—how can he speak of the Dao?\n\nHunting and chasing game drive the mind to madness, and coveting rare treasures obstructs conduct. Therefore, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes, and thus discards the former to take the latter.\n\nThe seven emotions arise from indulgence, and the three poisons stem from greed. Moreover, nature manifests through the heart as its exterior, and the heart manifests nature as its interior. When nature is settled and the mind is clear, with no attachment to external things, then hunting and rare treasures—what harm can they truly bring?\n\nTo hunt and chase game is to agitate *qi* and blood, dispersing them outward, and thus the mind becomes maddened. To covet rare treasures is to steal and deceive, to scheme and take crookedly, and thus conduct becomes obstructed. These are the things the sage does not do, and yet he says, “Nourish the belly, not the eyes,” to clarify that he nourishes the inner self and not the outer.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\n\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shocks; great calamities are like the body itself.\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation? Honor is lowly—when one gains it, it is like a shock; when one loses it, it is like a shock. This is called honor and humiliation as sudden shocks.\n\nWhat is meant by great calamities being like the body? The reason I have great calamities is that I have a body. When the heart is loyal to the Dao yet ensnared by things, it rejoices in glory and is shocked by misfortune, always burdened by gain and loss, and cannot attain the boundless.\n\nMoreover, when a man dwells in honor and receives his stipend, gaining glory for himself, if he resides in it with ostentation and refuses to decline, if he acts arrogantly and transgresses law, if he is haughty and despises the lowly, if he is dazzling and shames the humble—then accumulating gold and horses, is this not the height of honor? What humiliation is there to speak of?\n\nYet when he loses even a little, he considers it a grievous loss.\n\nThe perfected man is not thus: honor does not bring him joy, disgrace does not bring him sorrow. Receiving a stipend of ten thousand *zhong* (bushels), feasting on a square *fang* (hundred feet) of food—I do not possess it. Eating coarse grains and drinking from a gourd, dwelling in a thatched hut and a clay chamber—I do not sorrow. Gaining it is clamorous, losing it is clamorous—how can it truly shock me?\n\nOnly those who possess honor know the greatest humiliation—what else could it be but shock?\n\nWhen I have no body, what calamity can I have?\n\nThus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure is as if one could entrust the world to the heavens.\n\nMan receives his fate from the formless and takes shape in the formed. Moreover, when form arises from the formed, it combines the borrowed essences of earth, water, wind, and fire, generating the substance of spirit, *qi*, blood, and essence. Dwelling and moving cannot escape the constraints of cold and heat, and action cannot evade the demands of labor. Thus, even in drinking water and eating grains to fill the inner self, and in wearing silk and cloth to defend the outer, there may be excess or deficiency—how can one avoid calamity?\n\nOnly when one steals the true essence of yin and yang, and seizes the proper order of creation, when anger and joy depart from the chest, when cold and heat flee to the external, when one discards the borrowed Four Great Elements and has no body, when one reverses the Nine Transformations and returns to the Dao—then I, with this non-being, do not generate, and in emptiness, there is no transformation. What calamity can there be?\n\nThe Classic says, *“When I have no body, what calamity can I have?”*—is this not so?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\n\nThat which is unseen when viewed is called *yí* (level/even),\nThat which is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (rare),\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (subtle).\n\nThe Dao dwells above the **Tàisù** (Great Purity) with no form, so the colors that color, even with the clarity of **Lílóu** (a mythical seer), have no place to apply their sight.\nThe Dao dwells within the **Tàixū** (Great Void) with no sound, so the sounds that sound, even with the acuity of **Shī Guāng** (a legendary musician), have no place to focus their hearing.\nThe Dao exists before the Nameless with no image, so the images that image, even with the strength of **Wū Gé** (a mythical giant), cannot lift its weight.\n\nThus, *yí* is why it is unseen when viewed,\n*xī* is why it is unheard when listened to,\n*wēi* is why it is ungraspable when touched—\nthis is when speaking of the constant.\n\nIf one opens the wise eye to perceive true color, then it can be seen when viewed;\nIf one awakens the subtle ear to hear rare sound, then it can be heard when listened to;\nIf one applies wondrous force to move great form, then it can be grasped when touched.\n\nThe reason the common man cannot is that the five colors blind the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five affairs obstruct the heart. These three cannot be forced or constrained, and thus they merge into one.\n\nThe Dao is nowhere and everywhere—it cannot be named by things, nor can it be represented by images. Yet when it fulfills its use for the world, then all things are without exception the Dao.\n\nMoreover, the Dao in things is one—it cannot be divided. Yet the sage speaks of *yí*, *xī*, and *wēi* as distinct, setting forth the tendencies of sight, hearing, and touch.\n\n「To speak of their differences, in truth there is no such difference—only the merging into one. How could one force or constrain them?\n\nIts upper aspect is not bright, its lower not dim.\nIt cannot be named when taut, nor does it return when slack—it is beyond all things.\nThis is called the *state of no-state*, the *image of no-image*—this is called *hūhuǎng*.\nFace it, and you see no head; follow it, and you see no tail.\nHold fast to the ancient Dao to govern the present’s existence.\nTo know the ancient beginning is called *Dao jì* (the Dao’s pattern).\n\nThings that cling to the Yang rise with clarity, those that cling to the Yin sink with obscurity.\nRising with clarity, beings with form hasten toward it;\nsinking with obscurity, things with shape flee from it—\nthus all under Heaven know the logic of approach and retreat.\n\nBut the Dao is not so.\nIts *qi* form ascends, yet does not shine as Yang;\nits emptiness descends, yet does not obscure as Yin.\nIts coming is without haste yet arrives,\nhow could one face it?\nIts going is without speed yet swift,\nhow could one follow it?\n\nTo exhaust its root, one probes the ancient past yet knows no beginning;\nto examine its end, one governs the present yet knows no change.\nWhen one applies the mysterious to it,\nabove, there is brightness to make it luminous—\nthen light shines upon all things,\nbelow, there is obscurity to make it dim—\nthen *qi* emerges from the *bó bó* (the hidden, the obscure).\nThe dimness above can be ascended to face it,\nthe dimness below can be sealed to turn away from it.\nThose who come, I greet with my spirit to meet them in advance,\nthose who depart, I follow with my virtue to attend them in retreat.\n*Hū* and *huǎng*—when *hū*, there is no thing yet things exist;\nwhen *huǎng*, there is no form yet forms appear—\nthis is not contrary to the classics,\nbut the subtle and profound words of the Old Master (Laozi) revealed.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Virtuous Gentleman**\n\nThe ancient virtuous gentleman was subtle, mysterious, and profound—\nhis depths were unsearchable.\nThe petty man is precise in things, the gentleman is precise in the Dao.\nPrecise in things, one is enslaved by them—his skill is finite.\nPrecise in the Dao, one nourishes it—his transformation is boundless.\n\nThus the ancient virtuous gentleman\nhid in the utmost seclusion,\nconcealed in the unfathomable,\nfully expressing his nature without fixed methods,\nexhausting its principles without stagnation.\nWhen he spoke, his words aligned with the Dao yet the multitude could not comprehend,\nwhen he acted, his deeds conformed to its logic yet the multitude could not grasp.\nSo it was that he sought the hidden yet saw alone,\ndrove the manifest yet moved alone—\ncirculating through the Six Voids yet harmonizing with Heaven beyond imitation,\nresponding to all changes yet governing things without obstruction.\nThus his subtle profundity and mysterious harmony\nthe people deemed unrecognizable—\nnot because he deliberately wished to remain obscure and distinct,\nbut because his Dao was deep and they could not perceive it.\n\n**Solemn yet yielding,**\nif his bearing is not dignified, there is no awe to be feared;\nif his body is not weighty, there is no decorum to be emulated.\nHow much more so for one who dwells in the profound abode,\nwho treads the true path,\nwhose speech is the *fa yán* (lawful speech),\nwhose actions are the *fa xíng* (lawful conduct)?\nHow could he be relaxed yet fear things,\nor yielding yet be intimidated by them?\n\nThus **solemn yet yielding** is fitting.\n**Clear like ice about to melt,**\nnature is originally empty—\nit becomes real only through things;\nnature is originally serene—\nit moves only through things.\n\nIndeed, the reason things are vast is Yang;\nthe reason they are bound is Yin.\nWhen Yang clears them, they expand freely, contented, and fulfill themselves,\nwithout clinging to things in their gathering or scattering.\nWhen Yin binds them, the non-existent adheres to the existent,\nthe scattered settles into the solid—\nthick forms cannot thin, weak forces cannot magnify—\nthis is the logic of *having* in things,\nnot the intent of *non-having* in the Dao.\n\nHow can it be compared?\nLike water’s nature—\nit may descend to the East, flowing through streams to learn the sea,\nor ascend to become clouds and rain,\nor guide itself as rivers and streams.\nDeep its source, long its flow,\nand far its influence—\ntruly self-sufficient!\n\nBut when Yin-*qi* congeals into ice,\nits source is blocked, its flow obstructed—\nand it cannot spread like water in four directions.\n\nThis is why the virtuous gentleman’s **clear nature is like ice about to melt**—\nseeking to return to its original state.\n\n**Sincere like the uncarved block,**\nornament overpowers substance—substance is destroyed;\nflower overpowers fruit—fruit is hidden.\nThe Dao of the virtuous gentleman\ndoes not display brilliant flowers to obstruct the great essence,\nnor does he exalt empty pretensions to conceal his true talents.\nHe guards the purity of Heaven’s nature while seeking unalloyed virtue,\ncollects the essence of Heaven’s truth while seeking unfeigned conduct—\ndwelling in the thick yet not in the thin,\nresiding in the whole yet not in the flawed.\nThis is what the classics call **sincere like the uncarved block**.」\n\nVast as the valley, its emptiness—\nsufficient for all things yet not claiming possession,\ndeep without a single particle yet not denying existence.\nThings come, and they are met without retention;\naffairs arise, and they are received without obstruction.\nThis is the nature’s boundless responsiveness,\nunshaken by things—\nthus vastness is like the valley.\n\nMuddled as the turbid.\nDull its radiance, it knows to conceal itself in retreat,\nblending with the dust, it knows to merge and reach the utmost void,\nsteadfast in stillness.\n\nWhen all things stir together, I observe their return.\nAll things teeming, they must return to their root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness,\nstillness is called restoring the Mandate.\nTo go forth and not return—\nits going will have an end;\nto depart and not return—\nits departure will surely wear thin.\n\nHeaven’s spring arises because of birth through emergence;\nits autumn comes because of return through restoration.\nBirth and emergence constitute the Mandate,\nreturn and restoration constitute nature—\nand yet it is said: *Where there is birth, there is nature*—\nwhy must one wait for restoration to see nature?\n\nBirth is movement, movement brings confusion—\nnature is never lost within it.\nWhat is meant by \"returning to the root is stillness\"?\nIt is returning to one’s nature.\nAgain, it says: *\"Only in stillness does one see nature\"*—\nyet here it speaks of stillness to restore the Mandate—\nwhy is this?\n\nBecause birth brings the Mandate,\nthe Mandate is always lost with nature’s decline.\nOnly in stillness does one see nature—\nthen the Mandate is restored.\nThis is exhausting nature to reach the Mandate.\n\nRestoring the Mandate is constancy;\nknowing constancy is clarity.\nIgnorance of constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.\nStillness is the root of nature,\nyet it moves at times to respond to things—\nnot because nature itself moves.\nConstancy is the essence of the Dao,\nyet it changes with things to respond to time—\nnot because the Dao itself alters.\n\nThe sage, at the moment of retreat and concealment,\ndoes not dwell in things;\nin silent repose,\ndoes not respond to time—\nthus his nature remains still and unmoved,\nhis Dao constant and unchanging—\nthis is restoring the Mandate.\n\nConstancy is stillness without emergence,\nthus nature is attained.\nKnowing constancy is clarity—\nself-revealing through emptiness,\nthus the Dao is attained.\n\nIf one acts without knowing constancy,\nresponding to change,\nthen the loss of nature and violation of the Dao\nwill lead to ruin—\nwhat else could it be but disaster?\nThus it continues: *\"Ignorance of constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.\"*\n\nTolerance is public virtue,\npublic virtue is kingship,\nkingship is Heaven,\nHeaven is the Dao.\n\nInfinite variations are not uniform,\nall movements are not one—\nto select them reveals vastness and subtlety with curves,\nto divide them reveals high and low with distinctions.\nThe sage seeks to unify through harmonizing movement,\nto equalize through myriad changes—\nall through tolerance.\nHow then is tolerance achieved?\nIt arises from knowing constancy alone.\n\nThrough tolerance alone,\nthose who encounter it find it broad and without bias,\nthose who respond find it singular and undivided.\nIts balance is unshakable,\nits emptiness unfathomable—\nthus, from self-tolerance, one reaches great public virtue.\n\nHaving attained public virtue,\none can govern all living things,\nenact laws for the world—\nthe myriad affairs, though complex, can be resolved by me,\nthe four seas, though vast, can be concealed within.\nThis is nurturing simplicity within while transforming customs.\n\nNow, muddled as the turbid—\nhow does this differ?\nWho can still the turbid with slow clarity?\nWho can settle the restless with slow vitality?\nClear water, if disturbed by things,\nbecomes turbid in its clarity;\nthe settled, if tempted by things,\nwill surely move in their stillness.\n\nTurbidity obscures clarity,\nyet cannot restore it through stillness—\nclarity is lost in turbidity.\nMovement disrupts stillness,\nyet cannot transform it through vitality—\nstillness is endangered by movement.\nThis is not the way of the virtuous gentleman.\n\nI am otherwise:\nstillness as constancy, slow clarity in turbidity—\nwhat harm is there in turbidity?\nMovement as change, slow vitality in stillness—\nwhat must be guarded in stillness?\n\nThus stillness does not lose nature,\nmovement does not lose the Dao,\nand there is no drowning in one extreme.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao\ndo not desire fullness.\nOnly because they do not desire fullness\ncan they avoid decay while remaining new.\n\nThings fail because of their completion,\naffairs decay because of their renewal—\nthus the cycles of success and failure,\nrenewal and decay,\nare fixed laws,\nyet human nature cannot escape them.\n\nBut the virtuous gentleman, guarding the Dao,\nallows decay to become renewal;\nhandling affairs,\nallows failure to become new success.\nAges pass without decay—\nconstant renewal;\na lifetime without failure—\nthus it is not achieved by other means,\nbut arises from not desiring fullness.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter on Attaining the Utmost Void**\nAttaining the utmost void,\nsteadfast in stillness,\nall things stir together.\nBorn yet not possessed,\nsometimes possessed—\nthis is the void not yet extreme.\nSettled yet unmoving,\nsometimes moving—\nthis is stillness not yet steadfast.\n\nThe Dao is above all things,\nresponding to myriad changes without depletion,\nguarding the true unity without exhaustion—\nencompassed by the vastness of the cosmos,\nno boundary is seen;\naided by the emergence of all living things,\nno movement is known.\nEmpty and reaching the void,\ndeep and ever serene—\nentering it in abundance does not fill it,\nexiting it in multitude does not disturb it.\nThus emptiness is attained to its extreme,\nstillness is guarded with steadfastness—\nand this is why all things stir together.\n\nAll things come,\nbeginning in formlessness,\nending in manifestation.\nIf the void is not extreme,\nthose born cannot avoid obstruction;\nif stillness is not steadfast,\nthose returning cannot avoid exhaustion—\nyet if I can return to it,\nthen human cultivation reaches its peak.\n\nHaving reached the peak of human cultivation—\nwhat then?\nIt is only to communicate with Heaven.\n\nWhen humans reach communion with Heaven,\nthis is the utmost.\nWhat need have they of things and persons to control them?\n\nThus it is the Dao.\n\nThis *sutra* is why it contains the Lord—\nthe Lord becomes King,\nthe King becomes Heaven,\nand Heaven returns to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**\n\nThe Supreme Sage, below knows of his existence;\nThe next, is praised and honored;\nThe next, is feared and reviled.\n\nOf old, the Sage’s governance\nstored thought in profound silence,\nrevered himself in the boundless void,\ndid nothing yet awaited the world’s actions,\nspoke not yet responded to the world’s changes.\nWith spirit he stirred and moved—\nthen commands issued without known origin,\nwith body he taught and transformed—\nthen governance unfolded without known means.\nThus the people were transformed without coercion,\nruled without effort,\nresponded without prompting,\nfeared without punishment.\nThey daily drew upon his virtue,\nunaware of virtue’s embrace;\nthey daily followed his Dao,\nunaware of Dao’s path.\nThus they flowed vast and self-sufficient,\nradiant and self-satisfied—\nthis is the governance of the Supreme Sage,\nwhere nature itself is the transformation.\nHence it is said: *below knows of his existence.*\n\nWhen the Three Sovereigns came after,\ninstitutions were refined,\nrewards and punishments were established.\nThere was governance that loved people\nas a guardian cherishes an infant,\nand virtue that returned the people\nlike water flowing to its source.\nWith kindness they nurtured them,\nand the people loved them as parents;\nwith benevolence they relieved them,\nand the people praised them as Heaven and Earth.\nThis was the age of deliberate action,\nwhere governance ruled the people—\nthus the people honored and praised them.\n\nBut the next was otherwise.\nSome established harsh laws and severe punishments\nto wield terror from above,\nothers inverted the Dao and ruined virtue\nand lost governance below.\nOne feared their threats yet dared transgressions\nto escape shame,\nthe other scorned their governance\nand disrupted norms to commit wrongs.\nThus laws, though feared, bred defiance,\nvirtue, though scorned, could not prevent it.\nThe people fell short of praise and honor,\nand the Sage above was ashamed of those who merely knew of him.\nHow could one not choose wisely?\n\nIf trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\nThus, value your words.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe people say, *\"It was natural.\"*\nWithin, it aligns with oneself;\nwithout, it deceives not the world—\nthis is called trust.\nTrust is what the Sage uses\nto proclaim commands and intentions,\nreaching to the four quarters.\nIf lacking in this, how shall the people trust?\n\nThe Sage first contemplates, then speaks;\nfirst deliberates, then acts.\nHis words are not reckless,\nhis speech not deceitful.\nHis commands are like divination—\ntrustworthy and verifiable.\nHis orders are like echoes—\nresponsive and certain.\nThus trust is established.\n\nBut if trust is lacking,\nits root lies in undervaluing words.\nWords, when valued, are not lightly spoken;\nwords, when valued, are not cheaply given.\nNot lightly spoken, they carry weight—\nno words are spoken in haste.\nNot cheaply given, they are honored—\nno words are spoken in vain.\nOnly thus do deeds reach fulfillment,\naffairs reach completion,\nand the people act naturally.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**\n\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\nren and yi arise;\nWhen wisdom emerges,\ngreat deceit follows.\n\nThe Sage, when facing affairs, has no intent;\nwhen encountering things, has no mind.\nNo intent—then the labor of governance and restraint\ndoes not manifest externally.\nNo mind—then the scheming of calculation and perception\ndoes not arise within.\nThus all actions stem from the Dao,\nall speech and silence align with the Dao.\n\nYet when myriad threads arise,\na hundred forms emerge,\nlove and hatred take shape,\nand the authority of taking and withholding is established—\nthen the Great Dao splits into two,\nand ren and yi are put into practice.\n\nWhen knowledge grows excessive,\nthe Sage guards with simplicity.\nWhen schemes arise from foresight,\nthe Sage employs obscurity.\nKnowledge, if not restrained, will be deficient—\nthen wisdom becomes rigid.\nPerception, if not obscured, will be unclear—\nthen schemes become cunning.\nThus wisdom arises from the chest,\nand great deceit from the heart—\nand the Dao is distant from us.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discard the Sage, Abandon Wisdom**\n\nDiscard the Sage, abandon wisdom—\nthe people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\nTo know all is called the Sage,\nto know everything is called wisdom.\nThe Sage, then, fulfills nature to realize the self,\nembodies the Dao to govern things—\nyet specifically discards this,\ndaring not to claim sagacity,\nfor it is beyond what the common people can attain.\nWisdom, then, reveals the past to foresee the unseen,\ndiscerns the present to know the unchanging—\nyet specifically abandons this,\ndaring not to claim knowledge,\nfor it is beyond what the common people understand.\n\nIf one claims sagacity,\nthose who fall short feign it with deceit.\nIf one claims wisdom,\nthose who lack it abandon truth for falsehood.\nOnly by discarding and abandoning them\ndo the people return to their natural inclinations—\nand their benefit increases a hundredfold.\n\nDiscard ren, abandon yi—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nHeaven has five decrees,\nhumans have five constants—\nthen parent and child are Heaven’s natural order.\nAt the beginning of Heaven’s decree,\ninnate knowledge arises from nature,\ninnate ability stems from no deliberation—\nand the essence of filial piety and kindness\nnaturally resides between parent and child.\nWhat need is there for teaching to guide them?\n\nYet when parent and child grow estranged,\nit is because ren and yi obstruct them.\nRen is love for others,\nyet when applied where love is absent,\nyi is propriety for others,\nyet when applied where it is unsuited—\nthen things contend in love where love is lacking,\nand people uphold propriety where it is misplaced.\nFilial piety and kindness may thus be lost.\n\nIf ren and yi are discarded,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\n\nDiscard cleverness, abandon gain—\nthen thieves and robbers will cease.\nTo value cleverness is to exhaust it,\nto value gain is to contend for it—\nthe roots of thieves and robbers.\nEmbrace simplicity, hold to purity,\nreduce private desires, minimize cravings.\nThose who follow the current flow far\nwill inevitably dry up,\nthose who cling to branches multiply\nyet will inevitably falter.\nNow, if one abandons the current to seek the source,\nthe source will surely clarify;\nif one discards the branches to return to the root,\nthe root will surely endure.\n\nThus, the three things are abandoned—\nyet what now remains?\nIt must be to realize one’s true nature alone,\nand so one sees simplicity, embraces purity,\nreduces private desires, and minimizes cravings,\nthat these may follow in turn.\n\n*\"Seeing simplicity\"* means no defilement to stain its essence,\n*\"embracing purity\"* means no ornament to disrupt its root.\nFewer private concerns mean no confusion to cling to things,\nfewer desires mean no theft or excess to lose oneself—\nhow then could these not be the removal of what disturbs the true nature?\n\n---\n\n**Daoist Classic Commentary (Upper Scroll)

Scroll) – Anonymous**\n\n**Chapter Twenty: \"Ceasing Learning Brings No Worries\"**\n\nCeasing learning brings no worries.\nLearning aims to exhaust the principles of things (理),\nbut the principles of things are inexhaustible—\nthus one cannot fully realize one’s nature (性).\nIf one cannot fully realize one’s nature,\nthen confusion and delusion arise,\nand worries and joys come uninvited.\n\nNow, when we say \"ceasing learning,\"\nit means learning has reached the point of exhausting principles,\nand one’s nature is attained.\n\nWhen nature is attained,\nno joy is greater than this—\nthis is why there is no worry.\n\nHow far apart are *wu* (無) and *a* (阿)?\nHow different are *shan* (善) and *evil* (惡)?\n\nIn abiding by the Dao/Way’s truth (真),\nthere is no distinction from falsehood (伪).\nIn attaining nature’s virtue/power (善),\nthere is no separation from evil (惡).\n\nIf truth is lost,\nfalsehood arises in its place.\nIf virtue/power is compromised,\nevil emerges from it.\nThus, the distance between truth and falsehood,\nand virtue/power and evil,\nis indeed not far—\nit is discerned by those who embody the Dao/Way.\n\nWhat people fear,\none must fear.\n\nThe Sage withdraws to seclusion,\nconceals himself in stillness,\nwanders leisurely and at ease,\nrejoicing in the purity of Heaven’s nature (天真).\nHe is unobstructed and harmonious,\nupright and pure,\nto grasp the reins of Heaven’s sovereign power (天宰).\nHe is enlightened and penetrating in his understanding,\nyet does not entangle himself in distinctions of things.\nHe stands above the world,\nyet does not clash with all affairs.\nThis is to abide by one’s own Dao/Way\nand not conform to things.\n\nBut when he conforms to the common ways,\nharmonizes without differing from the crowd,\nspeaks and mingles with things,\nhis actions align with the people’s afflictions—\nthen worries of good fortune and calamity cannot be avoided.\nThis is what people fear,\nand why it cannot be ignored.\n\nThe common folk bustle and rejoice,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrificial offerings,\nas if ascending the Spring Terrace.\nThey see the Dao/Way yet do not recognize it,\nfollow the Dao/Way yet do not understand it.\nThe six emotions (六情) overwhelm their spiritual depths (靈渊),\nthe five thieves (五賊) disrupt their true sovereignty (真宰).\nThis is the way of the common folk.\n\nThey do not know the loss of their nature (性),\npursue emotions for delight,\nindulge in things for joy,\nbustle to gratify their desires,\nand cling to appearances, following the world’s shifting moods—\nthus they deem their joy as grand as feasting on the grandest offerings\nor ascending the Spring Terrace.\n\nFeasting on the grandest offerings is deemed beautiful,\nascending the Spring Terrace is deemed honorable—\nthese two joys,\ncan the common folk truly attain them?\nOnly the truly joyful can.\n\nI alone stand in dread,\nas yet unmanifest,\nlike an infant before its first smile.\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nI alone seem dim and obscured;\nthe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am muddled and dull.\n\nThe Dao disperses from its pure transformation into the *wei* (維), while the loss of nature arises from harmony and suitability, manifesting as discord. When one exhales brilliance outward, substance is necessarily depleted within; when one shifts truth to external things, essence is inevitably consumed. Sometimes cunning arises from great falsehood, and deceit emerges from many paths—then my Dao is lost to them.\n\nBut I differ from this. I contain harmony while my thoughts do not yet sprout, guard the One while my purity does not scatter. I forget joy and anger to block my passions, assail love and aversion to dissolve their intent. Like the unmanifest before its form, like an infant before its first smile—who else could fully embody nature and the Dao?\n\nOnly by fully embodying nature does one always remain deficient,\nOnly by embodying the Dao does one always remain weak.\nTo be deficient for the sake of the world’s completeness,\nTo be weak for the sake of the world’s strength—\nThis is why I always differ from the common folk.\nThus, where they are bright and clear,\nI seem dim and obscured;\nwhere they are sharp and discerning,\nI am muddled and dull.\n\nMellow as the sea, yet unresting like a whirlwind.\nI dwell in emptiness and stillness to govern myself,\nI wait in depth and profundity to respond to things—\nThis is the embodiment of the Dao, hence my mellowness like the sea.\nI universally nourish the world,\nI am vast and scatter across all things—\nThis is the application of the Dao, hence my whirlwind without end.\n\nThe common folk all have their ways,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse.\nMy Dao is theirs is matter—\nMatter without the Dao does not arise,\nThe Dao without matter is eternal.\nI dwell in the Dao’s constancy—\nHow could matter affect me?\nThus I make matter serve my purpose,\nFor I am not enslaved by it.\n\nYet the common folk all have their ways,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse—\nIs it because I cannot enter or take?\nI alone differ from others,\nYet I value nourishing at the Mother’s breast.\nSpeaking of its beginning, it is like the unmanifest before its form;\nSpeaking of its eminence, it is like the Emperor before his emergence.\nThe heavens and earth are vast,\nWith the Dao as their origin;\nAll things are many,\nWith the Dao as their Mother.\nThe Mother has the way of giving birth and nourishing—\nI have long dwelled here, gazing—\nDo I not desire to be born?\nDo I not desire to be nourished?\nHaving been born and nourished,\nWhat else could I abandon the Dao for?\nThus, I value nourishing at the Mother’s breast.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Great Virtue Follows the Dao**\nThe manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao cannot be learned—\nIt is followed by nature and spontaneity,\nAnd those who follow nature naturally attain the Dao.\nWhen the Dao is attained by me,\nThen what I nourish is true,\nWhat I bestow is virtue,\nAnd virtue thus arises from the Dao,\nEmerging after me so that others may cultivate it.\n\nYet the Dao is without form,\nWhile virtue is with form.\nWhen virtue reaches its peak, it merges into the Dao;\nWhen the Dao is supreme, it disperses into virtue.\nThus, the interplay of Dao and virtue\nHas never been separable.\nThe Classic speaks of the manifestation of great virtue,\nFollowing only the Dao—\nIts principle is as such.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only vague and indistinct.\nIndistinct and vague, yet within it are forms;\nVague and indistinct, yet within it are things.\nProfound and dark, yet within it is essence—\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it is authenticity.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has never faded,\nTo observe all things.\n\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBecause of this:\nWhen the Dao reaches supreme stillness, it cannot be heard;\nWhen the Dao reaches supreme nothingness, it cannot be seen.\nTo move forward and meet it, there is no head to face;\nTo follow behind and track it, there is no tail to pursue—\nThis is the essence of the Great Dao,\nDwelling in its constancy.\n\nWhen it departs from its essence to manifest in application,\nIt cannot be said to be without form while lacking a name,\nCannot be said to be without substance while lacking appearance—\nThis is the \"having within the without,\"\nAnd thus forms emerge from the indistinct and vague.\n\nThis is its essence—\nCalled true nothingness;\nThis is its application—\nCalled true having.\nWhen there are forms, there are things;\nWhen there are shapes, there is nature.\nAfter forms and things arise,\nTo speak of essence is to speak of true having—\nTrue having is not the source of generation,\nBut it enters the realm of transformation,\nDwelling in the domain of yin and yang.\nWhen true nature is stirred, it transforms without transformation;\nWhen authentic *qi* circulates, it generates without generation—\nThis is generation,\nIts principle is profound.\nNot manifesting in visible forms,\nNot revealing in clear shapes—\nIt is truly true,\nTruly authentic,\nAnd always employs profundity and darkness in its function.\nOnly those who grasp the Dao,\nThe insight of the perfected,\nCan discuss this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Bending to Fulfil**\nBend to be whole,\nCrooked to be straight,\nHollow to be full,\nWorn to be renewed,\nFew to gain,\nMany to be confused.\nThe Dao disperses across the world—\nThose who grasp it subtly attain refinement,\nThose who grasp it sparsely attain coarseness.\nThus, the world’s people and things cannot help but differ in their distance, duration, elevation, and depth.\n\nThe Sage possesses the Dao in its completeness,\nReceives nature in its entirety,\nAnd in responding to the world’s diversity,\nAchieves the boundless within oneself—\nAll without relying on external means,\nBut following its inherent principle.\n\nMoreover, the world’s natures cannot all be straight—\nIf I insist on my straightness to correct others’ crookedness,\nMy straightness cannot avoid harm.\nThe world’s things cannot all be beautiful—\nIf I rely on my fullness without accommodating others,\nMy fullness cannot avoid loss.\nThings replace one another,\nNecessarily reaching a point of wear—\nIf I embrace renewal, then wear will come at its time;\nMatters intermingle,\nNecessarily bringing confusion—\nIf I survey broadly, then confusion will arise at its time.\n\nThe Sage knows this,\nFollowing the principles of things—\nThus, bending makes straight,\nLowering makes full,\nRenewing virtue daily while always embracing wear,\nGuarding with restraint to avoid confusion—\nOnly then, internally dwelling in the Dao,\nIs the Dao never incomplete;\nExternally governing affairs,\nIs governance never disordered.\nWith my subtlety awaiting the world’s multitude,\nWith my proximity drawing the far reaches of the four seas.\n\n---\n\n**The Way of Self-Effacement and Virtue**\n\nIf not by emptiness in dwelling upon oneself,\nAnd by expansiveness in treating others,\nThen how could one achieve such harmony?\n\nThus, the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under heaven.\n*Oneness* is the beginning of the Dao,\nThe origin of heaven and earth.\nBefore yin and yang were distinct,\nMy true essence was without falsehood,\nAnd when all things had not yet emerged,\nMy nature was without division.\n\nOthers and I cannot both be served by duality,\nHumans and things cannot be separated by mutual distinctions—\nThis is the transformation of the utmost purity,\nThe complete Dao of pristine essence.\nExtending this to all under heaven,\nHow could it not be the ultimate law?\n\nNot self-assertive, thus clear;\nNot self-righteous, thus victorious;\nNot self-conceited, thus enduring.\n\nOnly by not contending,\nThe world cannot contend with me.\nThe ancients spoke of *\"bending to preserve fullness\"*—\nWas this not a truth spoken sincerely?\nIt is indeed fullness that returns to its source.\n\nThe world’s clarity shines in seeing others,\nYet fails to see itself—\nNo greater clarity exists,\nFor without true clarity, one cannot see oneself,\nNor dare one claim to see others.\n\nThe world’s wisdom knows of others,\nYet fails to know itself—\nNo greater wisdom exists,\nFor without true wisdom, one cannot affirm itself,\nNor dare one affirm others.\n\nThus, when virtue extends to all under heaven,\nIts blessings are never excluded—\nWhen it transcends all people,\nNone can surpass its vastness.\nIf not the Sage,\nHow could its clarity not be self-assertive,\nUnable to bend and preserve fullness?\nHow could its wisdom not be self-righteous,\nUnable to yield and attain straightness?\n\nTo boast of one’s achievements until fullness overflows,\nReaching the point of false pretension—\nThen what of humility?\nTo vaunt one’s abilities until brilliance fades,\nReaching the point of self-exhaustion—\nThen what of renewal?\n\nSuch is the way of the common multitude,\nBut the Sage reverses this—\nHence, again he says:\n*\"Only by not contending,\nThe world cannot contend with me.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Rare and Natural**\n\nThe rare and natural—\nThat which has form can be deduced by principle,\nThat which has speech can be guided by things.\nSome matters arise from human action,\nOthers emerge from the unfolding of time—\nThese are not the true rare and natural.\n\nOnly that which cannot be forced yet comes to be,\nWhich cannot be summoned yet arrives,\nWhich is perceived by the spirit and then seen,\nWhich is heard by the *qi* and then understood—\nIf one receives without exclusion,\nThen transformation comes without prompting;\nIf one gives rise to what already exists,\nThen change emerges from what is present—\nThen what is there to do?\n\nIt is simply being in accord with nature.\nThis is why none can force it yet it is done,\nNone can transform it yet it is transformed—\nIf not the rare and natural, what else could it be?\n\nYet the unrefined cannot achieve this,\nAnd yet it is called rare—\nBecause to raise one corner is not to reflect the other three.\n\nA gusting wind does not last all morning,\nA sudden rain does not last all day.\nOf all that heaven uses to stir life,\nNothing is greater than the wind,\nAnd of all that nourishes things,\nNothing is greater than the rain.\nWind and rain are heaven’s resources,\nThe reliance of all things—\nYet they arise only when yin and yang meet in harmony.\n\nThe true essence of yin and yang\nIs upright yet without contradiction,\nHarmonious yet without discord—\nThus they arrive without fail,\nTheir coming is measured,\nTheir course is constant.\nThen where is the difference between gusting and sudden?\n\nOnly when they exceed their bounds,\nDo they become gusting wind or sudden rain—\nThis is the irregularity of yin and yang,\nAnd why they do not last all morning or all day.\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao:\nThe Daoist aligns with the Dao,\nThe virtuous align with virtue,\nThe lost align with loss.\nTo align with the Dao, the Dao is attained;\nTo align with virtue, virtue is attained—\nTo align with loss, loss is attained.\n\nTo dwell in the realm of the formless,\nTo be still in the midst of nothingness—\nNot to seek the Dao through names and instruments,\nNot to grasp it through forms and images—\nYet to remain ever in the profound transformations of the *mystic-mystic*,\nIn the depths of the *obscure-obscure*—\nWithout seeking the Dao, the Dao is found,\nWithout seeking virtue, virtue is found.\n\nOnly when one departs from the formless to cling to the formed,\nWhen one abandons Oneness to pursue duality,\nWhen one seeks the Dao’s name to claim attainment,\nWhen one seeks virtue’s splendor to claim attainment—\nThen, if attained, it is truly loss.\n\nTo seek the Dao without aligning with virtue,\nTo have virtue without knowing loss—\nThis is to dwell in the true boundary of the formless,\nIn the wondrous realm of the *mystic-mystic*—\nAnd to act without ever departing from the rare.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Stilted Cannot Stand**\n\nThe stilted cannot stand,\nThe straddling cannot walk.\nHumans must have nature,\nThings must have boundaries—\nIf nature is imbalanced,\nThe Dao cannot be fully preserved;\nIf boundaries are exceeded,\nThe Dao cannot be sought in its fullness.\n\nThus, the Dao arises from nature,\nNature enters through the Dao—\nTo return the body to the nameless,\nTo embody transformation in the natural,\nOne must first await the purity and stillness of nature.\n\nIf one desires to stand yet remains stilted,\nIf one desires to walk yet straddles—\nTo reverse and stand stilted,\nTo reverse and walk straddling,\nOne must know that it cannot be done.\n\nAn incomplete form struggles even in standing and walking,\nHow much more so an imbalanced nature\nThat could ever establish the Dao?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undifferentiated Origin**\n\nThere is an undifferentiated origin,\nBorn before heaven and earth—\nSilent and vast,\nIt stands alone yet never changes,\nIt moves in cycles yet never falters—\nShimmering above yet vast without form,\nObscure within yet indistinct without image—\nYin and yang concealed in a single hue,\nCreation and transformation hidden in the unfathomable—\nThen clarity and turbidity are not yet divided,\nHeaven and earth are not yet distinct—\nAnd yet, how could one call it *undifferentiated*?\n\nWhen heaven and earth are born\nAnd all things emerge,\nThen my Dao disperses and becomes distinct throughout the world,\nTo fulfill its function.\n\nNow, to speak of the undifferentiated origin—\nIt is the ancient Master’s desire to gather the world’s scattered fragments\nAnd return them to Oneness,\nTo complete the ten thousand things without end,\nTo move in cycles without depletion,\nAnd to ensure the ages without flaw—\nHence he says:\n*\"It stands alone yet never changes,\nIt moves in cycles yet never falters.\"*\n\nTo stand alone yet never change,\nThis is how the Dao undifferentiated remains above to return to its source—\nTo move in cycles yet never falter,\nThis is how the Dao undifferentiated flows below to embrace transformation—\nThen the principle of the undifferentiated origin\nIs revealed in these two aspects.\n\n「Thus, the Dao can be the mother of the world.\nI do not know its true name, so I call it *Dao*,\nand forcefully name it *Great*.\nGreat it passes, passing it goes far,\nfar it returns.\n\nIn the past, the singular *qi* filled the four directions without bound,\nand permeated the six voids without end.\nIt covered the heavens above yet no one knew its limits,\nit filled the earth below yet no one knew its depths—\nhow could this be?\n\nThe Sage, after distinguishing the heavens and earth,\nat the beginning of all things,\nendowed it with the name *Dao* and forcefully called it *Great*—\nthus, the name of *Great Dao* is what the Sage forcefully bestowed,\nnot because its essence is thereby established.\n\nOnly because it is *Great*, it traverses the world’s functions,\nreaching everywhere, exhausting all things of the four seas.\nTo reach everywhere is called *passing*;\nto exhaust all things is called *far*.\nWhen the Dao reaches *far*, then evil scatters and distances itself from the root,\nthus it returns to restore the beginning,\nand ensures that the end becomes the start in eternal cycles—\nthis is why *far* is called *returning*.\n\nHence, the Dao is great, the heavens are great, the earth is great,\nand the ruler is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four great things,\nand the ruler occupies one of them.\n\nHumans follow the earth, the earth follows the heavens,\nthe heavens follow the Dao, and the Dao follows *Ziran* [自然].\nThe heavens and earth possess the utmost sovereign,\nyet the Dao surpasses them all;\nall things have their formed principles,\nyet the Dao is their deepest mystery—\nthus, the Dao, encompassing the universe to its utmost extremes,\ndwelling above the Three Realms [三才],\nis great beyond measure.\n\nFrom singularity to duality, the Two Polarities [两仪] take their positions:\nthe one above, exalted and boundless in its far-reaching,\nthe one below, profound and vast without end—\nwho could surpass their nurturing and encompassing function?\nIts greatness thus attains the Dao’s singularity.\n\nWith the Two Polarities established, the Sage stands in the middle,\npossessing utmost sovereignty to govern all things,\nand utmost fairness to uphold the Great Dao,\nfulfilling the ranks of humanity,\nand embodying the ruler’s Way—\nhow could this be considered small?\n\nThis is why the ruler is also great.\n\nTo elaborate and clarify,\nthe greatness of the Dao is the heavens,\nthe greatness of the heavens is the earth,\nthe greatness of the earth is the ruler—\nthus, it follows below with: *\"Humans follow the earth,\nthe earth follows the heavens,\nthe heavens follow the Dao.\"*\nYet the Dao itself follows none—\nit arises from *Ziran* alone,\nhence: *\"The Dao follows Ziran.\"*\n\n**Chapter XXVI: On Weight as the Root of Lightness**\nWeight is the root of lightness,\nstillness is the sovereign of agitation.\nThus, the virtuous person walks all day without straying from his baggage.\nThough surrounded by splendor and spectacle,\nhe rests in detached serenity.\nHow could one of the ten thousand chariots\nconsider his own body as weightier than the world?\n\nThe principles of heaven and earth,\nthe sentiments of all things—\nwhen steadfast, they are weighty;\nweighty, they return to their source.\nWhen tranquil, they are still;\nstill, they restore their true nature.\n\nYet when entangled in the world’s myriad principles,\nvariation arises from it;\nwhen embroiled in all things’ diverse sentiments,\nstratagems emerge from it.\nVariation arises, and myriad forms come together,\nwhile weighty things are burdened by lightness;\nstratagems emerge, and falsehoods intermingle,\nwhile still things are disturbed by agitation.\nThe affliction of frivolity and superficiality sometimes manifests,\nand omens of good and ill, regret and blame,\nreach everywhere.\n\nIn the past, weight was lost to its source,\nand stillness in its time was disrupted by agitation—\nthus, it was not good.\n\nThe virtuous person knows that weight is the root of lightness,\nso he walks without straying from his baggage;\nknows that stillness is the sovereign of agitation,\nso though surrounded by splendor and spectacle,\nhe rests in detached serenity.\nThus, the virtuous person’s understanding of weight, lightness, agitation, and stillness\nalso returns to the source and restores true nature.\n\nLightness leads to losing one’s subjects,\nagitation leads to losing one’s sovereignty.\nA ruler, though noble as the Son of Heaven,\npossessing wealth of the four seas,\nhis power is the utmost sovereign,\nhis station the utmost height—\nhis weight is indeed unexcelled.\nIf he opposes the world with his own body,\nif he regards the world as the multitude,\nand his own body as weighty,\nthen with the sovereignty of the ten thousand chariots,\nhis own body should be considered light.\nYet this is not good.\n\n**Chapter XXVII: On Benevolent Action**\nBenevolent action leaves no tracks or traces,\nyet with chariots he traverses all lands,\nand on foot he ascends every path—\nhis actions, though vast, are thus benevolent.\n\nThe Sage embodies the spirit in the most profound depths,\nconceals the marvelous in the unfathomable.\nIn stillness, he dwells with the Dao,\nin motion, he emerges with the Dao—\nwhen he acts, how could there be tracks or traces to observe?\nIt is simply without.\n\nTracks imply stagnation in movement,\ntraces imply obstruction in passage.\nThe Sage’s actions are without stagnation yet ever in motion,\nwithout obstruction yet ever in passage—\nthough enduring to the ten thousand ages,\nwhat flaw could there be?\nThis is because he is wholly dedicated to the Dao.\n\nBenevolent speech is without blemish or censure,\nThe Sage dwells in the Dao within himself,\nand employs the Dao to benefit all things.\nWhen dwelling within himself,\nhe is silent and exchanges with the spirit,\ndark and unites with the mind—\nradiant within the marvelous transformation,\nquiet within the mysterious creation—\nwhy would speech be preferred over this?\n\nYet when he emerges to benefit all things,\nengaging in deeds and stirring the heart’s voice,\nhe proclaims a single word to make the world his law,\nand spreads a single teaching to set the ten thousand ages as his standard.\nHe dispels the dullness of the common people,\nand awakens the deafness of the world—\nthus, his speech arises from necessity.\n\nYet even his speech,\ndoes not multiply to excess nor deplete by scarcity—\nwhen much, it exhausts all principles,\nfilling the world yet never wrong;\nwhen little, it adheres to the law,\nnot reaching even a single scroll yet still right—\nthis is benevolent speech,\nhow could it not be without blemish or censure?\n\nTo invert this with unbenevolent speech,\nemerging to invite blame,\nmoving to regret,\nrecklessly creating flaws,\nand cleverly harming virtue—\nit is not merely without blemish or censure,\nbut also brings harm.\n\n**On Benevolent Planning Without Calculation**\nExhausting the realm’s transformations,\nits variations are endless;\ncomprehending the world’s numbers,\nits reckoning is boundless.\nExhausting one’s intelligence leads to fatigue,\nexpending one’s strength leads to depletion—\nthough one may wish to calculate,\nit cannot be measured.»\n\nThe Sage acts otherwise—\nholding fast to the One to govern myriad changes,\ncalculating for oneself as for all things.\nOutside the One, there are no numbers;\nwhen numbers reach me, they are all summed in the One.\nOutside the self, there are no things;\nwhen things come to me, I respond with the self.\nThus, myriad changes return to the One,\nmyriad things are embodied in the self—\nthe world’s numbers are known without descending from the hall,\nso why bother with reckoning rods?\nIf not for Benevolent Planning,\nit would be impossible.\n\nBenevolent closure requires no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened.\nEmerging to meet the world,\nusing the Dao as its function,\ndrawing forth those who cannot yet,\nreceiving those who have not yet arrived—\nthen the path must be clearly revealed,\nthe words plainly established,\nopening my way so people may ascend with ease,\nclearing my gate so they may enter with haste.\nBut when withdrawing to conceal in secrecy,\nspeech does not mingle with affairs,\nthe body does not touch with things—\nquietly abiding, the spirit cannot be glimpsed at its edge,\ndarkly guarding, none know its place.\nBlocked by no path, sealed by no gate,\ncut off from the external yet firm within,\nemerging from things and entering the Dao—\nno drawing forth, so the unready have nothing to await,\nno receiving, so the unarrived have nothing to reach.\nThough no bolts or bars guard the gate,\nnone can open and enter—\nthis is called Benevolent closure.\n\nBenevolent binding requires no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.\nCommon trust may falter with time,\nso it must be bound with restraint.\nThe Sage’s trust is vast—\nwith my own trust binding the world’s trust,\nto demonstrate to future ages,\nto descend unendingly,\nand make the myriad people rely on a single word—\nhow could it be undone?\nThus, the Sage always excels in saving people,\nso none are abandoned;\nalways excels in saving things,\nso none are discarded.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao—\nthe Dao has no people or things,\nsharing the desire for life,\nunited in aversion to death.\nIf even one is abandoned,\nwhere would people and things find sustenance?\nThus, the Sage always excels in saving people and things.\n\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nthe unvirtuous are the resources of the virtuous.\nNot valuing one’s teacher,\nnot cherishing one’s resources—\nthough wise, one is greatly confused—\nthis is called the supreme subtlety.\nWhen people depart from their nature,\nthe division between virtue and unvirtue arises.\nUsing virtue to save unvirtue—\nthis is how one becomes a teacher.\nLeveraging unvirtue to manifest virtue—\nthis is how one becomes a resource.\nIf spoken in terms of the Dao,\nthe teacher is not to be valued,\nthe resource is not to be cherished.\nValuing the teacher creates *self*,\ncherishing the resource creates *other*—\nwhen *self* and *other* both exist,\nthe heart of distinction arises,\nand this is a harm to the Dao—\nyet again, not Benevolent.\nOnly through wisdom as confusion\nis this called the supreme subtlety.\n\nHow so? With knowledge, perception is revealed externally,\nthoughts are stored within,\nand discernment is bent by things—\nthen true essence is sometimes obscured.\nInstead, as if in confusion,\narising from ignorance,\nnot displaying externally in forms,\ninternally awakening to emptiness—\nthis is the Dao’s supreme subtlety.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**\nKnowing the Heroic, guarding the Receptive,\nbecomes the valley of the world.\nAs the valley of the world,\nconstant virtue does not depart,\nreturning to the infant.\nTaking the Yang as Heroic,\nthe Yin as Receptive—\nYang is inclined to action,\nYin to stillness—\nthus knowing the Heroic is to know action,\nthe Receptive is to know stillness.\nThe Perfect One abides in emptiness within,\nextends generosity to others,\ndoes not rely on possession to lead,\nconstantly dwells in humility and self-effacement,\nreceives from things without feeling full,\npenetrates understanding without claiming it as *self*,\nembodies natural transformation without departing from innate purity,\nreturns to the essence of the Great Primordial without mixing with uncarved truth—\nthus, none do not guard the Receptive,\ntaking stillness as the valley and fulfilling nature,\nuntil constant virtue does not depart,\nlike the infant.\nThe infant—\ntaking in true essence without expelling it externally,\nguarding the One without scattering into multiplicity.\nIf one knows the Heroic and favors action without guarding it with the Receptive,\naltering nature toward substance without attaining emptiness—\nhow could one become like the infant?\n\nKnowing the Bright, guarding the Dark,\nbecomes the model of the world.\nAs the model of the world,\nconstant virtue does not err,\nreturning to the Boundless.\nBrightness is yet to receive the five colors,\nso its staining depends on time—\nthis is the beginning of color.\nThe Perfect One guards against this,\nso as to guard the Dark.\nThe Dark—\nonce colors are formed, they cannot change.\nYet though unchangeable,\nin direction it is the North,\nin season it is Winter.\nWhen direction reaches the North,\nEast and South arise from here;\nwhen season reaches Winter,\nSpring and Summer emerge from here—\nthus, beginnings arise here,\nand endings complete here—\nits force is boundless,\nits transformation vast and thorough—\nthus, the Perfect One guards it.\nOnly by guarding this\ndo things transform and complete,\naffairs reach their limits and change,\nthe myriad people take it as model,\nthe world embodies it as law—\nits virtue thus reaches the Boundless.\nIf not for guarding the Dark,\nhow could one attain this?\n\nKnowing Honor, guarding Humiliation,\nbecomes the valley of the world.\nAs the valley of the world,\nconstant virtue is sufficient,\nreturning to the Uncarved.\nThe Dao is never openly displayed in brilliance,\nnature is always directed toward filth and obscurity—\nwhen the Dao is displayed and bright,\nconcerns cannot retreat to seclusion,\nwhen nature is filthy and obscure,\nexcess and waste become dangers.\nThus, vastness bends itself in humility,\nemptiness responds to others—\nknowing honor as the root of harm to the Dao,\nI reject it;\nknowing humiliation as the foundation of perfecting nature,\nI embrace it—\nresponding to their coming without depleting my abundance,\nsupplying their departure without exhausting my emptiness—\nrich with surplus, content with sufficiency,\nthen pure and constantly returning to the Great Uncarved.\nThis perfection of nature—\ndivine and bright.\nThe Uncarved disperses to become vessels,\nthe Sage uses it to become officials and leaders.\n\nThe Way is that which is beyond form—\nreturning to the Uncarved in its origin.\n\nForm is that which is beneath—\nthe time when the Uncarved disperses into vessels.\n\nThus, the Great Measure does not cut.\n\nThe Way is governed by Nature—\nhow could there be carving or severing?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: On Those Who Would Take the World by Force**\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it—\nI see their necessity as unavoidable.\n\nOf old, the sovereigns of the world\ndwelt in ease and leisure within the rocky and boundless,\ndeep in silence and stillness, yet at peace upon their mats,\ngoverning by the Way so that the people knew not their actions,\nworking by spirit so that none observed their deeds—\nthis was the age of Non-Action,\nnot something to be seized.\n\nIf one acts and only then achieves,\nif one does and only then completes,\nif one commands and only then obeys,\nif one punishes those who do not obey,\nif one rewards only after labor is done,\nif one punishes only after failure,\nif one waits to attack those who do not court,\nif one waits to execute those who do not transform—\nthen such governance cannot be joyous,\nonly endured when there is no alternative.\n\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nit cannot be acted upon.\nTo act upon it is to ruin it;\nto grasp it is to lose it.\n\nThus things move or follow,\nbreathe in or exhale,\nstrengthen or weaken,\nrise or fall.\nIf one regards the world as having substance,\nthen myriad flaws arise daily,\nthousandfold changes cluster,\nthings become enemies to action,\naffairs become calamities to governance—\nthen one’s heart grows weary, one’s thoughts labor,\nseeking governance yet never attaining it.\n\nOnly when one forgets the world within,\nwhen internally there is no self,\nwhen externally there are no things—\nwhen there is no self, then transformations unfold unseen,\nwhen there are no things, then the Way and virtue manifest beyond knowing.\nThe arts of ritual and music for governing the people—\nI shall use them to cultivate my own self.\nThe laws and measures for governance—\nI shall use them to discipline myself.\nWhen myriad forms contend, I do not seek them;\nwhen affairs and things come, I do not grasp them—\nthis is the principle that the world’s divine vessel cannot be acted upon.\n\nIf one acts, one ruins it;\nif one grasps, one loses it—\nall because one competes with things.\nThings have their own movement and following,\nand they are never aligned—\nwhen one moves ahead, the following must lag behind.\nThings have their own inhaling and exhaling,\nand they are never unified—\nwhen one breathes to warm, the exhaling has already arrived.\nIf strength and weakness succeed one another,\nif rise and fall alternate—\nthese are the inevitable consequences of having substance.\nTo contend with force, to scheme with intelligence,\nto argue with clarity, to scrutinize with acuteness—\neven the Sage would find it exhausting.\nHow could I bear such strain?\n\nThus, the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids excessiveness.\nThings have their proper measure,\naffairs have their constants.\nTo exceed one’s measure is excess—\nexcess without harm is the greatest harm.\nTo overstep constants is extravagance—\nextravagance without restraint is the greatest distress.\nExcessiveness arises from these two—\nit cannot aid the Sage, hence it is rejected.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: On Assisting the Sovereign with the Way**\nTo assist the sovereign with the Way\nis not to strengthen the world with arms—\nits effects return naturally.\n\nThe Way has its essence,\nthe Way has its function.\nWhen dwelling in its essence,\nit is vast and does not respond to affairs,\nit is serene and does not follow the world—\nthus, to dwell in the Way and find joy.\n\nWhen the Way is applied,\nit engages in action and responds to affairs—\nthen in virtue it is virtue,\nin governance it is governance,\nin teaching it is teaching,\nin transformation it is transformation—\neven to refining laws and establishing new codes,\nall are matters of assisting the sovereign with the Way.\n\nOnly by assisting the sovereign with the Way\ndoes one serve people with virtue,\nteach the people with righteousness—\nthose who do not court you return with their own benevolence,\nthose who do not transform return with their own governance—\nwhy then would one strengthen the world with arms?\n\nThus, those who return are like water flowing to its source,\nthose who come are like children yearning for their father—\nhow could there be any fault in their return?\nHence it is said: *its effects return naturally.*\n\nWhere the teacher dwells, thorns grow.\nAfter great armies, there are years of famine.\nThus, the virtuous act only when necessary,\nnever daring to seize strength.\n\nAct decisively yet without arrogance,\nact decisively yet without boasting,\nact decisively yet without pride—\nto act only when necessary is to act without seizing.\n\nThe ancient Sages used arms\nonly to supplement virtue,\nnot for joy in action,\nonly when there was no alternative.\n\nThus, the Yellow Emperor had the battle of Chiyou,\nKing Wen had the campaign against the Rong—\nall sought not to delight in war\nbut to achieve victory over others,\nultimately to perfect governance.\n\nIf one boasts of martial prowess,\nif one brags of military strength,\nif one grows proud of battlefield triumphs—\nthen one clearly delights in war,\nand such will be seen as tyranny,\ncontrary to the principle of acting without seizing.\n\nTo act decisively is to seek governance,\nnot to seize victory—\nthis is to know that where the teacher dwells,\nthe land’s *qi* is injured,\nand after great armies, Heaven loses its harmony,\nthus there are years of famine.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth are thus harmed,\nhow could the use of arms not also cause loss?\nThis is the Sage’s warning.\n\nWhen things are at their peak, they grow old—\nthis is called *not* the Way,\nand the Way perishes early.\n\nTo know the masculine and guard the feminine,\nto know the masculine as movement—\nfrom this, fortune and misfortune arise—\nthus, to guard stillness is to remain constantly at ease.\n\nTo know the white and guard the black,\nto regard black as the north—\nthus, returning to the beginning,\nthere is no end.\n\nThese two speak of the Way’s movement and stillness,\nits beginning and end.\n\nBefore distinctions arise,\nthe True does not mingle with things,\ntransformation does not shift with emotions—\nnot allowing rise and decline to interfere with governance,\nnot allowing vigor and decay to steal one’s merit—\neternally unspent, forever without end—\nwhy burden oneself with such concerns?\n\nMoreover, when things reach their peak, they grow old—\nthis is not the Way.\nSince it is not the Way,\nit should perish early.\n\n**Chapter 31: The Virtuous Warrior**\n\nThe virtuous warrior—\na weapon of ill omen,\nwhich men detest.\nThus, the Daoist does not dwell upon it.\n\nTherefore, the noble man at home values the left,\nin war, values the right.\nA weapon is an ill-omened tool,\nnot the tool of the noble.\nWhen used, it must be done with solemn restraint—\nthis is the highest virtue.\n\nTo triumph without delighting in it—\nyet to delight in it is to rejoice in killing.\nHe who rejoices in killing\ncannot prevail under Heaven.\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\ninauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe Left General takes the left,\nthe Supreme General takes the right—\nthis is to treat the high position as a funeral rite.\nWhen many are slain, weep with sorrow—\nvictory is treated as a funeral rite.\n\nTo slaughter *qi* and harm harmony,\nto wage war without virtue—\nthough ten thousand are vanquished,\na thousand of ours are lost.\nHow much worse if we fail yet suffer no harm?\nThus, it is rightly called an ill-omened tool—\nand the Daoist does not dwell upon it.\n\nThe Daoist, embracing *Oneness* above,\nsettles the people within.\nTo guard *Oneness* with *wuwei* is to follow nature—\nthus, at ease and wandering,\never aligned with the Way.\nTo govern the people through institutions is to manifest law—\nthus, adapting and transforming,\never approaching the Way.\n\nThough war is ill-omened,\nthe Daoist does not delight in it.\nIf forced to use it,\nlet restraint be supreme.\nWhy flaunt our might to cow their courage,\nor march our armies to suppress their chaos?\nDo not revel in killing,\nbut let victory serve the Way.\nDraw all benefits to the True Source,\nand with three reversals, plan for triumph—\nthis is not to boast of beauty.\nIf one boasts of beauty,\nthen he delights in killing—\nhow can he be called Daoist?\n\n**Chapter 32: The Way’s Nameless Perfection**\n\nThe Way is ever nameless.\nThough simple, it is unmatched under Heaven.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would come as guests.\n\nTrue yet undivided,\npure yet unadorned—\nunmixed in its purity,\nunbroken in its completeness—\nthis is called *Pu* (the Uncarved Block).\n\nThe Way’s *Pu* ever returns to the Nameless,\nthe Way’s *Pu* ever returns to the Formless.\nNameless—it may be grasped in a word,\nFormless—it may be sought in a thought—\nthus, it is called small.\n\nYet when it emerges to respond to Heaven’s transformations,\nwhen it disperses to fulfill all forms—\nthose with *xing* (nature) are born of *xing*,\nthose with form are transformed by form.\nFrom this, Heaven begins,\nand all things take their mother.\nVastly dwelling before the Imperial Form,\nstanding above the most refined—\nwho then could subdue it?\n\nIf kings and lords guard this *Pu*,\nall things will come as guests.\nWithin the central realm, four great forces exist—\nthe Way and the King each occupy one.\nIf the King wields this *Pu* to govern all things,\nthen under Heaven, far and wide,\nthe good will come without urging,\nthe wicked will depart without punishment—\nuntil even those with eyes strain to see,\nand those with feet rise to hasten.\nThose transformed by its influence have no outer limit,\nthose who receive its virtue have a place to return.\nSmall and great gather in clouds,\nnear and far follow as shadows—\nis this not to be served as guests?\n\nIn speaking of the Way, none can subdue it—\nthis is called the most exalted.\nIn speaking of all things, they come as guests—\nthis is called the most honored.\nMost exalted, most honored—\nthe Way cannot be sought in forms and tools,\nthus it is called *Pu*.\n\nSeek it, and you find it;\nabandon it, and you lose it.\nIt comes when sought,\ndeparts when abandoned—\nhow could it not be small?\nThis small is not merely small—\nit is small yet vast,\nthus none can subdue it,\nand all things come as guests.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet it is evenly bestowed.\n\nThe Great Way is hidden in yin and yang,\nyin and yang are hidden in the Great Way.\nHeaven and Earth are the Way’s yin and yang,\nthus yang descends below,\nyin ascends above—\ntheir *qi* merging,\nforming sweet dew.\n\nMoreover, at the Way’s beginning,\nit split and gave birth to One—\nin the Five Phases, it is water;\nin man, it is life.\nThus, Heaven and Earth have the principle of generation.\n\nThat which gives life must also complete it—\nthus, sweet dew’s transformation is through *qi*,\n*qi*’s transformation is through form—\nand nothing fails to be born.\nWithout the harmony of yin and yang to fulfill its purpose,\nnone can speak of it.\n\nWhen naming first arose,\nnames already existed.\nKnow when to stop—\nknowing when to stop is to avoid peril.\n\nThe Way lies beyond things,\nits *Pu* is nameless.\n*Pu* disperses within things,\nbecoming forms and tools—\nand names arise from this.\n\nNames bring reality,\nreality brings measure,\nmeasure brings cycles of renewal and decay,\nof formation and ruin—\nthus, it departs from *Pu*.\n\nIf one does not know when to stop,\npursuing names exhaustively,\nobserving forms to establish many theories,\nwearing out spirit and mind without satisfaction,\nexhausting thought and labor under burdens of care—\nis this not perilous?\n\nKnowing when to stop is to avoid peril.\n\nThe Way in the world\nis like rivers and valleys to the sea.\nAt birth, all men share the Way,\npossessing its nature.\nDay by day, month by month,\ntime will shift them.\n\nHaving gathered nature through the Way,\nthe people’s return is but a restoration to their root—\nwhat harm could there be in not following?\n\nThis is like rivers and valleys to the sea—\nthey do not await summons before they come.\n\n**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**\n\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao is Universal**\n\nThe affairs of the world cluster thickly yet are difficult to distinguish;\nif one does not know how to discern them,\nthe false may pass for the true.\n\nThe things of the world blend indistinguishably yet are hard to tell apart;\nif one does not know how to discern them,\nthe similar may be taken as the same.\n\nWhen it comes to bending myriad emotions to return to the proper,\nobserving myriad changes to suit what is fitting—\nthe foolish dare not claim to be wise,\nwhile the wise, though not overlooked, may still have regrets.\nIf not for knowing others,\nhow could one achieve such?\n\nIs this not what we call *wisdom*?\n\nWisdom lies in knowing others,\nbut one’s own right and wrong may still be insufficient to perceive,\none’s own virtues and vices may still be insufficient to discern.\nWhen one must act,\nit is not enough to simply *take* what should be *taken* or *discard* what should be *discarded*.\nEven so, though wise, one is not yet *enlightened*.\n\nAs for *enlightenment*,\none perceives one’s own right and wrong,\nnot confusing wrong for right,\ndiscerns one’s own virtues and vices,\nnot clinging to vice as virtue.\nEvery word spoken must accord with human sentiment,\nevery deed done must align with the will of the multitude.\nWithin, there is no bending to please or flatter,\nwithout, no factionalism to seek praise—\nthis is the *self-knowing* one,\nfar surpassing mere *knowing of others*,\nhence called *enlightenment*.\n\nThe victorious over others have *strength*,\nbut the self-victorious are *powerful*.\nMengqin compared to an infant,\nthe rhinoceros-tiger compared to a wasp or scorpion—\nwhat is their victory worth?\nIt comes merely from *strength*.\n\nThus, to bully the weak with the strong,\nto oppress the few with the many,\nis not truly remarkable.\n\nBut if one conquers one’s own private interests,\ndiscards one’s own desires,\nand gains enough to harm oneself or enough to invite self-reproach—\nthis is the *self-victorious*,\ntranscending mere victory over others,\nhence called *powerful*.\n\nThe contented are *wealthy*.\nIf one’s nature strays from its proper measure,\nthen greed knows no end.\nIf the Dao fills one’s self,\nthen one’s desires are satisfied.\n\nThus, the perfect sage does not yield to the fame of profit and desire,\nnor is he entangled in the realm of superficial splendor.\nExternal things cannot lure his true heart,\nempty praise cannot sway his noble resolve.\nHe nourishes himself with the true,\nfills himself with the Dao,\nand remains ever-satisfied within—\nthis is *wealth*,\nand this is greatness.\n\nThe resolute in action have *will*.\nA *Pegasus* leaps a single stride,\na *clod-horse* ten strides.\nIf a *Pegasus* were to travel a thousand *li*,\nit would not be called *willful*—\nonly the *clod-horse*, with its strong and unyielding force,\npushing forward step by step without pause,\nand thus able to reach its destination—\nthis is what we call *will*.\n\nThe enduring last long in their place.\nThe true does not yield to external forces,\nnature does not shift with circumstance—\nthus, one attains one’s proper place.\nAttaining one’s place,\none rejoices in what is naturally held,\nfinds peace in what is spontaneous—\nthis is how one endures.\n\nThe one who dies yet does not perish is *long-lived*.\nThose who die must have once lived,\nthose who live must one day die—\nsince birth, all men and things\nhave never been free from these two fates.\n\nOnly by preserving the true spirit within,\nby safeguarding the true nature at its core,\ndoes one not cling to things—\nfor things cannot then alter one’s self.\nNor does one scatter outward—\nfor externals cannot then lure one’s self.\n\nThough the form may rot,\nmy true essence remains whole in stillness.\nThough fame may fade,\nmy nature abides in the distant.\nThough traces may vanish,\nmy spirit ever watches.\nThough words may cease,\nmy *qi* ever speaks—\nthis is the one who dies yet does not perish,\nwhose life is great.\n\nThe Great Dao is universal,\nneither leaning left nor right.\nIt revolves through motion and stillness,\ndwelling nowhere it does not.\nIt flows universally, fitting all curves,\nand nowhere it cannot go.\n\nTake from the left, and the right is not hindered;\ntake from the right, and the left is not neglected.\nThe small is not deemed insignificant,\nthe great is not feared.\nThe void is not seen as lacking,\nthe full is not seen as overabundant—\nall this is the Great Dao,\nis it not universal?\n\nThe myriad things rely on it to be born,\nyet it does not refuse them.\nIt accomplishes its work,\nyet does not dwell upon it.\nIt clothes and covers all things,\nyet does not claim lordship over them.\n\nBefore the two *principles* were distinguished,\nthe Dao was pure and uncarved above—\nsimple and unadorned—\nwho could be the *Heaven* and *Earth*?\nWho could be the myriad things?\nNone could know.\n\nOnce the two *principles* were divided,\n*yin* and *yang* split apart,\ntheir transformations spread through the four seasons,\ntheir growth and completion through the myriad things—\nthen the Dao was dispersed.\n\nYet, the past was not deemed *nonexistent*,\nthe present is not deemed *existing*.\nThe former was not deemed *great*,\nthe latter is not deemed *small*.\nThus, all things are born through it,\nyet it does not refuse—\nits birth is endless.\nIts work is accomplished for all,\nyet it does not dwell—\nits work is without end.\n\nAll things gain it and live,\nlose it and die.\nFlowering and fruiting,\nturning toward or away,\ngathering or scattering—\nnone escape this,\nis it not the *master*?\n\nYet it does not claim lordship—\nfor it is hidden in the minutest blades of grass,\nnot deemed *nonexistent*,\nand it permeates all transformations,\nnot deemed *existing*.\n\nIt has no desires,\nyet may be called *small*.\nAll things return to it,\nyet it knows no lordship—\nthus may it be called *great*.\n\nThe Dao is without desires,\nyet the perfect sage, with no desires to ponder,\nattains it—\nhence called *small*.\n\nThe Dao is without bounds,\nfilling all space without limit,\nno thing can escape it—\nhence called *great*.\n\n*Small* stops at *no desire*,\nbut with desire, one responds to all things endlessly—\nthis is not *small*.\n*Great* stops at *knowing no lordship*,\nbut knowing lordship sets one in opposition to things,\nleading to fixed boundaries—\nthis is not *great*.\n\nOnly in its *no desire* and *knowing no lordship*\ncan the Dao’s *small* and *great* be named.\n\nThus, the sage can achieve true *greatness*—\nfor it is by not claiming self as great\nthat he attains true *greatness*.\n\nThe sage enters and dwells with the Dao,\nexits and walks with the Dao.\nHis subtlety is aligned with the Dao’s Way,\nhis emptiness with the Dao’s substance—\nthus, the sage and the Dao are one.\nHence, he achieves true *greatness* without claiming self as great,\nand thus is truly *great*.\n\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**\nGrasping the Great Symbol,\nthe world comes to it.\n\nThe sage abides in lowliness,\nusing the Dao to govern himself.\nIn motion, his bearing responds,\nyet nothing exceeds the Dao.\n\nThe sage ascends to high station,\nemerging to attend the emperor’s affairs,\ndisplaying his role as a sovereign’s teacher.\nWith presence spanning the Four Seas,\nhe guides the distant and the near,\nbringing them to harmony.\nDaily surveying myriad matters,\nhe cultivates virtue among the people—\nis this not wielding the Great Dao to rule the world?\n\nNow, what is called the *Great Symbol*:\nit is the Dao’s application in governing the people.\n\nIf I grasp nothing,\nthen the tools of governance and instruction may falter,\nthe implements of law and order may be seized,\nand the people of the world would have no reliance—\nhow could they come?\n\nOnly by grasping this Great Symbol\ndo I hold what I possess,\nclutch what I control—\nall matters of governing the people,\nI bear them in my hands.\nWhy would the world not come?\n\nSpeaking of the *Symbol*, it is precious to hold fast—\nthus, we speak of the *Great Symbol*, not the *Great Dao*.\n\n**Chapter 36: The Chapter of Welcoming and Withdrawing**\n\nWhen one seeks to withdraw it,\none must first firmly extend it;\nwhen one seeks to weaken it,\none must first firmly strengthen it;\nwhen one seeks to ruin it,\none must first firmly promote it;\nwhen one seeks to take it away,\none must first firmly give it.\n\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nHeaven and Earth have their constant principles,\nyin and yang their proper nature—\nthe interplay of cold and heat,\nthe succession of flourishing and decline among all things,\nuntil they reach their end and begin anew,\nexhaustion and rebirth—\nthis is the natural, knowable order.\n\nThus, the interplay of withdrawal and extension,\nweakness and strength,\nruin and promotion,\ntaking and giving—\nthe withdrawn precedes the extended,\nthe weak follows the strong,\nruin precedes flourishing,\ntaking follows giving,\nand all must come in turn—\nthis is what the common world observes.\n\nThe sage abides in the Dao,\ntranscending Heaven and Earth’s constants,\nadjusting yin and yang’s proper nature,\npenetrating hidden truths,\nsuspended beyond measure.\nSwift and slow appear where none can know,\ndelay and haste arise from what is unseen.\nTo welcome it, he appears first—\nyet suddenly it is behind;\nto follow it, he appears last—\nyet suddenly it is ahead.\nWhen it departs, it returns;\nwhen it perishes, it revives—\nghosts and gods cannot spy its traces,\nyin and yang cannot encompass its subtlety.\nThus, the sage’s Dao\nfully exhausts its transformations.\n\nThis withdrawal and extension,\nweakening and strengthening,\nruining and promoting,\ntaking and giving—\nare without fixed principles to constrain it.\nThis is what is called *subtle yet clear*.\n\nThe *subtle* perceives the hidden and discerns what is coming,\nknows the early signs and sees what is first,\npenetrates the nature of things,\nilluminates hidden truths—\nand has the means to explore what is yet unformed.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak overcomes the strong.\n\nIn its emptiness, the Dao\nreceives the world’s utmost transformations;\nin its formlessness, it\nwithstands the world’s utmost power.\n\nThough its simplicity is small,\nnone in the world can subdue it.\nAll things return to it,\nyet it does not claim them as its own—\nthis is the Dao’s softness and weakness—\nwho can overcome it?\n\nThose who serve the Dao\nhow could they not humble themselves,\nharmonize and weaken,\nnot be full yet await their own?\nAlways modest, deferring to others—\nhaving virtue yet not possessing it,\nhaving ability yet not relying on it,\nnot contending yet the world regards them first,\nnot boasting yet the world regards them capable—\nthis is the softness and weakness of serving the Dao,\nalso unconquerable.\n\nYet to reverse it:\nthe great bends to the small,\nthe high is humbled by the low,\nseeking to be hard and strong,\nto overcome the soft and weak—\nthis is truly not knowing the Dao.\n\nThe fish cannot be taken from its depths,\nnor can the state’s sharpest tools be openly displayed to the people.\n\nThe fish, as a creature,\ndwells hidden in the profound and boundless,\nconcealing its form to preserve its life,\nyet when exposed to light, misfortune comes.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao to govern the world,\npreserves the spirit to transform the people,\nreveals subtle and manifest principles\nto meet the needs of the times,\nshows the first signs of change\nas the threads of action,\nflux and transformation move beyond all naming,\nbenefits and uses are concealed beyond all measure.\nThe people daily shift toward goodness,\nunaware of how it comes to pass,\nthe world daily ascends to order,\nunseeing its source.\nThis is why sharp tools are not displayed to the people,\nand thus such harmony is achieved.\n\nWere the mechanisms exposed to the times,\nwords proclaimed to the people,\nand the methods of law and governance revealed,\nthis would not be the way of sharp tools.\nThe Sage holds it in shame.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven of the Dao/Way’s Constant Non-Action**\nThe Dao/Way is ever without action yet accomplishes all.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\n\nIts essence is emptiness and stillness,\nits application is flux and adaptability.\nIts essence, emptiness and stillness,\ngathers all to the silent void,\ncollects the great tranquility within vastness,\nthen swift or slow responses arise naturally,\nwithout contrivance or effort.\nIts application, flux and adaptability,\nreaches across the world without fixed course,\naligns with all transformations without rigid stance,\nmoves and turns with grace—\ndepart from this, and discord follows;\nresponds to all with fitting measure—\nlack this, and chaos ensues.\nEven to the most vast or minute,\nlong or short, high or low,\ncrooked or straight—\nnone escape its guiding course.\nThis is the Dao’s *without failing to act*.\n\nWithout action, it responds to all transformations above,\noperates within the six directions below—\ntruly, it acts.\nWithout failing to act, it stirs with the spirit unseen,\nmoves without trace,\nacts without display—\nthus, it achieves perfect non-action.\nThis is the Dao’s principle of *non-action yet without failing to act*.\n\nIf lords and kings guard this to govern the world,\nno words need be spoken yet commands resound across the seas,\nno movements occur yet teachings shine forth—\nthis is the Dao’s *without action yet without failing to act*,\nunless they embody the Dao, how could it be?\n\nTo transform yet to contrive,\nI would steady it with the nameless simplicity.\nThe nameless simplicity,\nalso, would not desire to contrive.\nWithout desire, stillness reigns,\nand the world would self-correct.\n\nHuman nature begins with the balance of impulses,\nholds the purity of its origin,\nthe pristine essence preserved within,\nthe vital source intact—\nthis is the time of *embracing simplicity*.\nYet as passions are pursued, the essence scatters,\nas external influences take hold, the spirit perishes,\nas indulgence in desires meets false ends,\nas delight in superficiality forsakes the root—\nthis is to stray from nature, lose simplicity.\n\nIf there were a means to save it,\nit would revert—\nyet once the world’s transformation is complete,\nits order long established,\nthe people would grow weary.\nBeginning with naturalness,\nending with contrivance,\npure yet yielding to flaws,\nharmonious yet conforming to deceit—\nthe world’s ways would shift accordingly,\nhow could they revert?\n\nUnless steadied by the nameless simplicity,\nthe true nature would restore itself.\nYet the Sage embraces simplicity\nonly to govern himself,\nnot to save others.\n\nWhen the world’s contrivance begins,\npassions and deceits have already taken root,\nchanges and distortions have emerged,\nthe pristine essence fades,\nthe great simplicity decays—\nthen to steady it,\nhow could this be my wish?\n\nBetter to remain still and correct oneself\nthan to seek correction in others.\nThe great Dao originates with the nameless,\nas the beginning of heaven and earth.\nYet when the nameless simplicity is used\nto suppress the world’s desires,\nthe Dao reaches its end.\nThis is why the *Supreme Sage* composed the *Dao/Way Classic*,\nand this is its final teaching.\n\n**End of the *True Classic of Dao and Virtue/Power*

(解卷下)**\nBy an anonymous author.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Virtue/Power of the Supreme Virtue/Power**\n\nThe Supreme Virtue/Power does not act in virtue/power,\nAnd thus has virtue/power.\nThe lesser virtue/power clings to virtue/power,\nAnd thus lacks virtue/power.\n\nThe Supreme Virtue/Power acts without contrivance,\nYet achieves nothing.\nThe lesser virtue/power acts with contrivance,\nYet achieves something.\n\nThe Supreme Benevolence acts without contrivance,\nYet achieves nothing.\nThe Supreme Righteousness acts with contrivance,\nYet achieves something.\n\nThe Supreme Rites act with contrivance,\nYet none respond—\nThen they bare their arms and force compliance.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue/power arises;\nWhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, rites arise.\n\nFor rites are the thinnest of loyalty and trust,\nYet the beginning of chaos.\nPreemptive foresight is the adornment of the Dao,\nYet the start of folly.\n\nThus, the noble one dwells in the thick, not the thin,\nIn the substance, not the adornment—\nTherefore, he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nThe Supreme Virtue/Power is the Virtue/Power of Heaven.\nThe Sage observes Heaven,\nSilently aligning with the Dao,\nFinding nothing to grasp—\nThus, it is said, he does not act in virtue/power.\nBecause he grasps nothing,\nVirtue/power naturally returns to him—\nThus, he has virtue/power.\n\nThe lesser virtue/power is the virtue/power of grasping.\nThe lesser virtue/power clings to virtue/power,\nAnd thus is called \"not losing virtue/power.\"\nBut those who cling do not embody the Dao and virtue/power—\nThus, they lack virtue/power.\n\nThe Virtue/Power of Heaven is beyond attainment,\nSo it acts without contrivance and achieves nothing.\nThe virtue/power of grasping clings to its attainment,\nSo it acts with contrivance and achieves something.\n\nWhen virtue/power descends to benevolence,\nBenevolence can be wielded—\nThus, the Supreme Virtue/Power acts without contrivance,\nWhile Supreme Benevolence acts with contrivance.\nYet great benevolence is not benevolence—\nThough it acts, it achieves nothing,\nAnd nearly approaches the Supreme Virtue/Power.\n\nRighteousness encompasses virtue/power,\nYet righteousness can be diminished—\nThus, the lesser virtue/power acts with contrivance,\nAnd even Supreme Righteousness does so.\nYet inwardly, it establishes the self without forgetting it,\nOutwardly, it governs affairs without abandoning them—\nThough called Supreme Righteousness, it still clings,\nThus achieving something and resembling the lesser virtue/power.\n\nWhen the Dao declines and virtue/power wanes,\nTransformation and righteousness are both lost—\nUsing rites to interact with others,\nThis is the exchange of sincerity for pretense,\nAnd thus, action breeds calamity.\nWhen none respond, they bare their arms and force compliance—\nFrom this, one can see what is lost,\nAnd each descent is clear—\nThus, it is said:\nWhen the Dao is lost, virtue/power arises;\nWhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, rites arise.\n\nWhen Supreme Rites act and none respond,\nThis is the thinning of loyalty and trust.\nBaring arms and forcing compliance—\nThis is the beginning of chaos.\n\nYet virtue/power encompasses both high and low,\nWhile from benevolence downward,\nOnly the high is spoken of—\nThus, the low is already unworthy of mention.\nAs for preemptive foresight as foresight,\nIts higher aspects are not even mentioned—\nThis is even more beneath rites.\n\nExhausting thought and straining deliberation,\nSharpening and refining—\nThus, it is called the adornment of the Dao.\nWearying the mind and laboring the spirit,\nLosing one’s true nature—\nThus, it is called the start of folly.\n\nSince it is not said that rites follow wisdom,\nIt is because those who rely on rites disrupt virtue/power,\nAnd those who rely on wisdom invert the Dao.\n\nThus, the noble one dwells in the thick of virtue/power,\nNot in the thinness of rites,\nIn the substance of the Dao,\nNot in the adornment of wisdom—\nTherefore, he discards the adornments of human conduct\nAnd takes the substance of the Dao of Transformation.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Chapter of the Ancient Attainment of Oneness**\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained Oneness:\nHeaven attained Oneness and became clear,\nEarth attained Oneness and became tranquil,\nThe spirit attained Oneness and became responsive,\nThe valleys attained Oneness and became full,\nAll things attained Oneness and flourished,\nAnd the sovereigns attained Oneness to govern the world aright.\n\nTheir attainment of Oneness was such:\nIf Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear cracking,\nIf Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear erupting,\nIf the spirit lacked responsiveness, it would fear fading,\nIf the valleys lacked fullness, they would fear drying up,\nIf all things lacked flourishing, they would fear extinction,\nIf the sovereigns lacked right governance, their noble status would fear collapse.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as its foundation,\nAnd the high relies on the lowly as its base.\nTherefore, sovereigns call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" and \"not-grain\"—\nIs this not relying on the lowly as foundation?\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, the carriage of ten thousand horses is not adorned,\nNot polished like jade, nor rugged like stone.\nOneness is the Dao.\n\nBefore form, there was nothing attained—\nWhen the undifferentiated became distinct,\nIt originated from ancient times,\nAnd thus things obtained it.\n\nHeaven, firm and vast above,\nUses non-action as its function,\nThus attaining the Dao and becoming clear.\nEarth, settled and vast below,\nUses stillness as its essence,\nThus attaining the Dao and becoming tranquil.\nThe spirit, hidden and profound in the depths,\nUnfathomable in yin and yang,\nThus attaining the Dao and becoming responsive.\nThe valleys, hollow and sunken,\nFollow the Dao of Heaven—\nSince Heaven attains the Dao and becomes clear,\nThe valleys attain the Dao and become full.\nThings, still and nurtured,\nFollow the Dao of Earth—\nSince Earth attains the Dao and becomes tranquil,\nThings attain the Dao and flourish.\nThe spirit dwells in the body,\nThe sovereign of all limbs—\nThe spirit, the sovereign of all saints,\nThe sovereign of the world—\nSince the spirit attains the Dao and becomes responsive,\nThe sovereign attains the Dao to govern the world aright.\n\nThis attainment is none other than the Dao.\n\nIf Heaven loses its clarity,\nIt would have nothing to cover—\nAnd would fear cracking.\nIf Earth loses its tranquility,\nIt would have nothing to bear—\nAnd would fear erupting.\nIf the spirit loses its responsiveness,\nIt would have nothing to guard—\nAnd would fear fading.\nIf the valleys lose their fullness,\nThey would fear drying up.\nIf all things lose their flourishing,\nThey would fear extinction.\nIf the sovereigns lose their right governance,\nTheir noble status would fear collapse.\n\nThus, the lowly returns to them, displaying their nobility,\nThe lowly adheres to them, displaying their height—\nJust as mountains accumulate the low to become high,\nAnd seas gather waters to become vast,\nGreat persons unite to become sovereigns—\nThus, the noble and high cannot abandon their fundamental base.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign attains Oneness within his domain,\nAnd thus calls himself \"lonely\" and \"widowed,\"\nFeeding on the qi of Great Harmony,\nAnd thus calls himself \"not-grain.\"\nWith a hundred limbs,\nOnly then is the body’s sovereign noble—\n\nThe noble is honored only when the people exist—\nThus, the sovereigns attain their exalted titles through this,\nIs it not because they take the lowly as their foundation?\n\nNow, the making of a carriage is but an analogy drawn near.\nIf one were to assemble the yoke, axles, wheels, and spokes before you,\nAnd count their many parts,\nYet constrain their use,\nThey would still not suffice to form a carriage.\nOnly when the yoke, axles, wheels, and spokes are united\nDoes the carriage earn its name of conveyance;\nOnly when the people, low and humble, are gathered\nDo the sovereigns attain their titles of nobility and height.\n\nJade is noble, stone is lowly—\nJade, emerging from stone, becomes noble,\nFor it takes the lowly as its foundation.\nYet jade has inherent substance and thus is noble by itself,\nWhile the sovereign, though possessing Oneness,\nDoes not inherently become noble—\nCould he truly wish to be like jade and stone?\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Motion of the Dao in Reversal**\nThe motion of the Dao lies in reversal,\nIts use lies in weakness.\nAll things under heaven are born of *having*,\nAnd *having* is born of *non-having*.\n\nStillness is the way of Earth.\nTo reverse Earth’s stillness into motion\nIs the response of yin to yang—\nThus, it is said: *The motion of the Dao lies in reversal.*\n\nWeakness is the way of Heaven.\nTo employ Heaven’s weakness as use\nIs the response of yang to yin—\nThus, it is said: *The use of the Dao lies in weakness.*\n\nYang employs *non-having* as its use,\nYin employs *having* as its substance.\nWhen yin and yang interact within the boundless void,\nThen things are born.\n\nAll things under heaven are born of Earth’s way,\nThus, it is said: *All things are born of having*—\nThis is the motion of the Dao in reversal?\nYet what is formed cannot suffice for life without Heaven’s way,\nThus, it is said: *Having is born of non-having*—\nThis is the use of the Dao in weakness.\n\nTherefore, the Sage speaks:\n*Having* takes *non-having* as its mother,\n*Non-having* takes *emptiness* as its mother,\n*Emptiness* takes the Dao as its mother.\nNaturalness is the root of the Dao.\nIf one can preserve and guard the Mysterious Pivot,\nAnd follow its naturalness,\nThen, from motion returning to stillness,\nAnd gathering use back into substance,\nOne will return to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**\nThe superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it;\nThe mediocre person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly, as if it might vanish;\nThe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThus, the *Building of Speech* says:\nThe Dao is bright yet seems obscure,\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreat,\nThe Dao’s path is smooth yet seems rugged,\nVirtue’s height is like a valley,\nGreat whiteness seems like shame,\nBroad virtue seems insufficient,\nEstablished virtue seems lazy,\nAuthentic truth seems false,\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel takes longest to shape,\nThe greatest sound is faint,\nThe greatest form is shapeless,\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao is good at lending itself to completion.\nThe superior person, having already understood the Dao,\nThus holds it with sincerity and guards it firmly—\nWhen they hear it, they must act upon it with vigor.\nThe mediocre person, striving to advance in the Dao,\nMakes effort and only then succeeds—\nWithout effort, they fail.\nThey ponder and only then attain it—\nWithout pondering, they do not.\nOne moment they advance, the next they retreat—\nEven when they hear it, doubt lingers in their hearts,\nThus, between existence and nonexistence,\nThey do not yet act upon it.\nThe inferior person takes the Dao’s path as level,\nLike one with coarse ears who does not hear great sounds,\nLike one with a common mind who rejects lofty speech—\nWhen they hear the Dao, they scorn it with derision,\nThus, they oppose the Dao utterly and laugh at it.\nIf the Dao were not laughed at by the inferior,\nHow different would it be from what coarse ears hear,\nFrom what the multitude speaks?\nHow could it suffice to be called the Dao?\n\nThus, the *Building of Speech* says:\nThe Dao is bright yet seems obscure—\nIf one stores it diligently in thought,\nFixes it in stillness, and reflects in silence,\nAnd strives in its practice,\nThen one attains it.\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreat—\nIf one calculates it daily and finds it insufficient,\nYet calculates it yearly and finds it in excess,\nAnd in existence and nonexistence bears no burden,\nThen it is acceptable.\nThe Dao’s path is smooth yet seems rugged—\nIf one clings to the attainable forms, colors, names, and sounds,\nAnd the pleasures of ear, eye, nose, and mouth,\nThen when people laugh at the Dao, one has erred.\nYet do they not know that the Four Great Elements exist within the domain,\nYet are not external to the Dao?\n\nThe highest virtue is the way of Heaven.\nHeaven’s way is hollow yet full—\nBecause it is hollow, it is like a valley.\nGreat whiteness is the way of the King.\nThe King’s way is worn yet renewed—\nBecause it is worn, it is like shame.\nBroad virtue, spoken of in terms of Earth’s way,\nIs used without depletion,\nYet its completion seems lacking—\nThus, it seems insufficient.\nEstablished virtue, spoken of in terms of the Great Dao,\nIs built without being uprooted,\nYet its cultivation is unnoticed—\nThus, it seems lazy.\nBecause it is like a valley, like shame, like insufficiency, like laziness,\nOne might doubt its changing nature.\nYet its essence as highest virtue, as great whiteness, as broad virtue, as established virtue\nRemains eternally true—\nThis is called *authentic truth seeming false.*\n\nWhy is authentic truth said to seem false?\nBecause the greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel takes longest to shape,\nThe greatest sound is faint,\nThe greatest form is shapeless.\nThe greatest square carries all things,\nIts virtue harmonizes without force—\nThus, it has no corners.\nThe greatest vessel is used for its purpose,\nEnduring in its way—\nThus, it takes long to complete.\nThe greatest sound is unsounded,\nYet the four seasons move through it—\nThus, its voice is faint.\nThe greatest form is not a thing,\nYet all under heaven turn toward it—\nThus, it is shapeless.\nThese are the reasons the Four Great are great.\n\nVirtue encompasses the Dao,\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven,\nThe Emperor’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth’s ways,\nAnd is nameless—\nFor it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao is present yet hidden,\nAs if dividing the Four Great within the domain,\nAll are but its manifesting and forcing of names.\nThe Dao itself is not good at lending itself to completion,\nYet because Heaven, Earth, and the Emperor embody this Dao to complete the world,\nThe name of *good at lending itself to completion* is thus established,\nAnd the effect of its curved fulfillment is thus marked.\nYet its completion is merely so—\nCould there be intent in urging it to completion?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Gives Birth to Oneness**\nThe Dao gives birth to Oneness,\nOneness gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nThe Three gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang,\nAnd through their harmonizing *qi* achieve balance.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Dao of the Sovereign and the Sovereign’s Teachings**\nWhat men detest—*nao* (孤), *gua* (寡), and *bu gu* (不谷)—the kings and lords take as their titles.\nThus, things may be diminished to gain, or gained to diminish.\nWhat men are taught, I too teach with righteousness.\nThe strong and violent shall not meet their proper end.\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nThe *Easy* (易) transforms and becomes Oneness,\nFor this is how Oneness arises—\nThus it is said: *The Dao gives birth to Oneness.*\nOneness is the beginning of form’s transformation,\nThe greatest form of Heaven and Earth—\nThus it is said: *Oneness gives birth to the Two.*\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions,\nMan dwells between them, and the Three Powers are complete—\nThus it is said: *The Two give birth to the Three.*\nThe light and pure ascend to become Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid descend to become Earth,\nThe harmonizing *qi* becomes Man—\nThen Heaven and Earth contain their essence,\nAnd all things transform and are born—\nThus it is said: *The Three give birth to all things.*\nHeaven is yang, austere and solemn;\nWhat issues from Heaven, yin ascends to meet yang,\nAnd things bear it upon their backs.\nEarth is yin, resplendent and vast;\nWhat issues from Earth, yang descends to meet yin,\nAnd things embrace it within.\nAs yin and yang rise and fall,\nTheir interplay gives birth to the harmonizing *qi*—\nThus it is said: *All things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang,*\n*And through their harmonizing qi achieve balance.*\n\nA man’s body mirrors Heaven and Earth:\nWithin him, yin and yang and harmonizing *qi* are all present.\nThere must be a most divine principle governing him,\nJust as kings and lords govern the world.\nTo be solitary within this domain is *nao* (孤);\nTo feed upon the *Taihe* (太和) *qi* is *bu gu* (不谷).\nMen of the world turn from the divine, calling these evils,\nYet the kings and lords embrace them as their titles—\nThus it is said: *What men detest—nao, gua, and bu gu—the kings and lords take as their titles.*\n\nThe harmonizing *qi* of yin and yang permeates all things,\nYet by itself, it neither diminishes nor benefits.\nIt is through Heaven and Earth’s filling and emptying,\nTheir waxing and waning with time,\nThat things may be diminished to gain, or gained to diminish.\nWhat men are taught must align with Heaven and Earth’s rectitude.\nIf I cherish stillness, the people will naturally align—\nThis is my righteous teaching.\nThis is called *diminishing to gain*.\nThe strong and violent invert this—\nThus they do not meet their proper end.\nThis is called *gaining to diminish*.\nThe sage observes this and takes it as a warning,\nThus I shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Supreme Softness of the World**\nThe world’s supreme softness overcomes the world’s supreme hardness.\nNothing can penetrate the seamless—\nThus one knows the benefit of *wuwei* (无为).\nSilent teaching and the benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world attain them.\n\nSupreme softness is *shen* (神);\nSupreme hardness is *xing* (形).\nTrue *shen* communicates with the Dao,\nCapable of annihilation and existence—\nOnly by letting *shen* govern *xing* can *shen* make *xing* soar,\nAnd *xing* follow to roam at will—\nThus it is said: *The world’s supreme softness overcomes the world’s supreme hardness.*\nSupreme softness is without form,\nSupreme hardness is seamless—\nIf *xing* governs *xing*, there are gaps;\nThus the seamless cannot be penetrated.\nIf *shen* governs *xing*, *shen* has passage—\nNothing enters without finding its place—\nThus it is said: *Nothing can penetrate the seamless.*\n\nWhat *xing* transforms is silent teaching.\nWhat *shen* attains is the benefit of *wuwei*.\nIf one embodies the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nDwells in *wuwei*, and practices silent teaching,\nThen one shapes *xing* and harmonizes with *shen*—\n*Xing* and *shen* both reach perfection,\nAnd align with the true Dao.\n\nThe world values spoken teaching and active doing,\nThus few attain this.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Names and the Body**\nBetween names and the body, which is more intimate?\nBetween the body and wealth, which is more abundant?\nBetween gain and loss, which brings greater harm?\nThus, excessive love leads to great expenditure,\nAnd hoarding leads to great loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one may endure forever.\n\nThe noble man labors night and day in anxious deliberation,\nYet his body grows frail—\nThus he perishes for the sake of his name.\nWho sees what is truly intimate—the body or the name?\n\nThe wealthy man toils endlessly, amassing wealth he cannot fully use,\nYet his body grows estranged—\nThus he perishes for the sake of profit.\nWho sees what is truly abundant—the body or wealth?\n\nYet when honor and disgrace are established, one sees what truly harms;\nWhen wealth accumulates, one sees what is truly contested.\nThose who value display as right know that names bring honor,\nThose who value riches as right know that wealth brings profit—\nThus they see gain and forget the body,\nSee profit and forget the true self.\n\nThen, between gain and loss, which truly brings greater harm?\nWhat they lose is the nameless *pu* (朴),\nThe body unburdened by wealth—\nWhat greater harm could there be?\n\nThus, to love names excessively without restraint\nWill exhaust the greatest things—\nThe greatest things are the Dao’s designation,\nThe nameless *pu* itself.\nTo hoard wealth without knowing sufficiency\nWill deplete the deepest virtues—\nThe deepest virtues are the essence of *de* (德),\nThe body unburdened by wealth.\n\nOnly the sage embodies broad virtue in knowing sufficiency,\nYet does not prize his wealth—\nThus he does not bring disgrace upon himself.\nHe embodies supreme virtue in knowing restraint,\nYet does not exalt his name—\nThus he does not court peril.\n\nSuch a one may endure forever,\nAnd stand equal with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**\nGreat fullness seems as if deficient—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nGreat abundance seems as if empty—\nIts use is boundless.\nGreat truth seems as if bent,\nGreat skill seems as if clumsy,\nGreat eloquence seems as if inarticulate.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat—\nCalmness and purity are the world’s rectitude.\n\nGreat fullness is Earth’s virtue—\nBroad virtue seems insufficient,\nThus though complete, it seems deficient.\nGreat abundance is Heaven’s virtue—\nSupreme virtue does not indulge itself,\nThus though full, it seems empty.\n\nIf completion is like a mountain, it will inevitably crumble—\nThis is not great fullness.\nGreat fullness, though deficient, never crumbles—\nThus its use is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony with the Way**\nWhen fullness is like accumulated water,\nIts application will inevitably be exhausted—\nThis is not great abundance.\nGreat abundance seems as if empty,\nYet never exhausted—\nThus its use is boundless.\n\nThese two principles are the functions of Heaven and Earth—\nYin and Yang, they are.\nHeaven can generate without ceasing,\nYet its generative use is boundless.\nEarth can transform without ceasing,\nYet its transformative use is inexhaustible—\nThis is because the Way acts truly within them.\n\nOnly the unified is called the Three,\nThus, when Heaven and Earth are considered,\nThe Way becomes known.\nIf divided, then:\nGreat straightness seems bent—\nThis is the Way of Earth.\nEarth’s Way is straight yet restrained,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nGreat skill seems clumsy—\nThis is the Constant Way.\nThe Constant Way carves myriad forms yet does not indulge in cleverness,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\nHeaven’s Way does not speak yet responds perfectly,\nThus it seems mute.\n\nYet considering their essence,\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey do not depart from Yin and Yang,\nAnd one Yin, one Yang—\nThis is the Way.\nThus, accumulated Yang is Heaven,\nAccumulated Yin is Earth.\nYin is still, Yang is agitated,\nYang is hot, Yin is cold.\nThat which governs Yin is Yang,\nThus agitation overcomes cold.\nThat which governs Yang is Yin,\nThus stillness overcomes heat.\n\nYet when cold departs, heat arrives,\nAnd when heat departs, cold returns—\nHow could their use ever be exhausted or depleted?\n\nThe Way has clarity and turbidity,\nMovement and stillness.\nClarity is the source of turbidity,\nStillness is the foundation of movement.\nIf one can always maintain clarity and stillness,\nThen Heaven and Earth will all return to it—\nWhat then of things?\nWhat then of affairs?\n\nThus it is said:\nClarity and purity are the rectitude of the world.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony with the Way**\nWhen the world is in harmony with the Way,\nEven warhorses are turned to manure.\nWhen the world lacks the Way,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is greater than coveting acquisition.\nThus, the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\nOne who governs the world with the Way\nAlways keeps the people without knowledge or desire,\nSo each person rests content in their place without contention,\nAnd merely tends their fields.\nBut in the declining ages,\nWhen the Way cannot be revived,\nThen they see what is desirable yet do not know sufficiency.\nThus arises the heart of coveting acquisition,\nAnd they begin to plunder, usurp, and trample boundaries,\nWhile warhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nReflecting upon oneself,\nWithin one’s own world lies the self.\nIf the Way is applied to the self,\nThen one accepts one’s measure,\nAnd guards one’s inch of land with depth.\nIf the Way is lost in the self,\nThen one gallops and hunts recklessly,\nAnd the heart grows mad,\nWhile the inch of land is already lost.\n\nThus, no guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is greater than coveting acquisition—\nAll are transgressions of not accepting one’s measure.\nWhen this becomes extreme, contention and plunder follow.\nIf one can accept the measure of life and destiny,\nAnd return desires to their source,\nMaintaining clarity and purity in self-cultivation,\nThen sufficiency is found within the self—\nHow could there be insufficiency?\nThis is how the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door, one knows the world;\nNot peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus, the Sage acts without moving yet knows,\nSees without looking yet names,\nAchieves without doing.\n\nThe world—\nThe nine regions, mountains, rivers, seas—\nTeeming with ceaseless generation.\nThe Way of Heaven—\nThe four seasons, Yin and Yang, winds and rains—\nEndless transformation.\n\nReflecting upon the self,\nNothing is not perfectly rounded.\nThus the Sage says:\n“I share with Heaven and Earth one breath and govern together.”\nIf one understands this,\nThen one need not leave the door or peer through the window\nTo know and see the Way of Heaven and Earth.\nIf one seeks the Way beyond the self,\nThen the farther one goes, the less one knows.\nHow could one not know that within one body,\nTen thousand principles are all complete?\nTaking from the near,\nNothing is insufficient.\n\nThus the Sage embodies Earth’s Way,\nWith emptiness as the body,\nSo he acts without moving yet knows,\nWithout need to leave the door;\nEmbodies Heaven’s Way,\nWith non-action as the heart,\nSo he sees without looking yet names,\nWithout need to peer through the window;\nEmbodies the Great Way,\nWith naturalness as the constant,\nSo he achieves without doing,\nWithout need to exert intelligence in what is seen or done.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: Daily Learning and Daily Decline**\nDaily learning increases,\nDaily practice of the Way decreases.\nDecrease again and again,\nUntil reaching non-action yet nothing remains undone.\nThus, to take the world is always through non-affairs.\nBut when affairs arise,\nThey are insufficient to take the world.\n\nThe scholar seeks to exhaust principles,\nThus daily increase.\nThe practitioner of the Way seeks to perfect nature,\nThus daily decrease.\nDecrease again and again,\nUntil perfecting nature to its end—\nThis is reaching destiny.\nPrinciples have an end,\nNature has an exhaustion,\nYet one is not yet free from doing,\nThus it is called learning and practicing the Way.\nOnly when destiny is reached,\nDoes one return to the root—stillness.\nStillness is called returning to destiny,\nUntil reaching non-action.\n\nNon-action—\nThe time of tranquil, unmoving stillness—\nYet when moved, it responds and communicates with the world,\nThus it is also action.\nHence, non-action yet nothing remains undone.\n\nIf there is any doing,\nOne cannot avoid entangling in affairs;\nIf there is no doing,\nOne cannot avoid severing connection with things.\nHow does the Sage act in the world?\nHe merely dwells in non-affairs.\nDwelling in non-affairs,\nOnly then can one take the world.\nThus, to take the world is always through non-affairs.\n\nYet the world’s sacred instrument\nCannot be forced—\nForcing it ruins it,\nClutching it loses it.\nWhen affairs arise,\nThey are still insufficient to take the world.\nKnowing the world cannot be taken through affairs,\nOne must instead learn what is not learned,\nTo reach the Way of non-action.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Sage’s Birth and Death**\n\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe virtuous, I treat as virtuous;\nThe wicked, I also treat as virtuous—*virtue* is thus established.\nThe trustworthy, I trust them;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust them—*virtue* is thus established in trust.\n\nThe Sage moves in the world,\nHis heart blurred for all under Heaven,\nWhile the people fix their ears and eyes upon him—\nThe Sage treats them all as children.\n\nThe Sage seeks to return to the origin,\nTo revert to the unborn—\nThus he has no fixed heart.\nVirtue and vice, truth and deceit—\nThese are the deeds of men;\nI harbor no partiality within,\nBut simply follow the hearts of the people as my own.\n\nWhen the people act virtuously, I do not know it;\nWhen the people act wickedly, I do not know it.\nAccumulate virtue, and virtuous *qi* arrives—\nI do not know it as virtue, so the virtuous, I treat as virtuous.\nAccumulate vice, and wicked *qi* arrives—\nI do not know it as wickedness, so the wicked, I also treat as virtuous.\nTrust and distrust are the same.\n\nLet it unfold naturally—I harbor no falsehood within,\nThus *virtue* is established in both virtue and trust.\n\nThus, aligning the virtuous and wicked,\nUnifying truth and deceit,\nMy heart remains unattached to any side—\nHence, my heart is blurred for all under Heaven.\n\nThe people always have desires,\nChasing the pleasures of sound and color,\nThus they fix their ears and eyes,\nUnknowing how to withdraw their gaze or return their hearing,\nTo guard the Mother’s Way.\n\nOnly the Sage always has no heart,\nEmbracing the origin of all under Heaven,\nReturning to guard the Mother of all under Heaven—\nThus he treats them all as children.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death**\nBirth and death—\nThe followers of life are thirteen,\nThe followers of death are thirteen,\nAnd the ways of life that lead to death are also thirteen.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the excess of life’s life.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death (continued)**\n\nThus, the Master who skillfully guards life\nWalks upon land yet meets no rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnters battle yet is not struck by armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to strike its claws,\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no place of death for him.\n\nAll things arise from the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth—this is called life,\nAnd return to the transformations of yin and yang—this is called death.\nThose who follow life and death\nHave not escaped the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nNor have they avoided the transformations of yin and yang.\nYet, all things are born and die,\nWhile only humanity’s life is said to stir death’s domain thirteenfold—why?\nThis is all self-inflicted by the people,\nNot Heaven and Earth’s destruction,\nNor the harm of ghosts and spirits—\nFor they possess knowledge and their forms move.\n\nThey cannot turn away from life’s approach when seen,\nNor halt death’s departure when it comes—why?\nBecause of life’s excessive vitality,\nAnd the stirring of death’s domain.\nOnly the Sage embraces subtlety and simplicity,\nHolding to the uncarved and unadorned,\nDaring not to act or contend with the world.\nThough fierce beasts may be present, they cannot seize him,\nThough weapons may be drawn, they cannot harm him.\nFor his accumulated virtue is profound and boundless,\nAnd nothing can injure him—\nHence, there is no place of death for him.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao/Way Gives Life**\nThe Dao/Way gives life,\nVirtue/power nurtures it,\nForm shapes it,\nConditions perfect it—\nThus, all things honor the Dao/Way and value virtue/power.\n\nThe Dao/Way’s honor,\nVirtue/power’s nobility—\nNo one bestows these titles,\nYet they remain ever natural.\nTherefore, the Dao/Way gives life and nurtures it,\nLengthens it and rears it,\nPerfects it and ripens it,\nNourishes it and protects it.\nGiving life yet not possessing it,\nActing yet not claiming it,\nLengthening yet not controlling it—\nThis is called profound virtue/power.\n\nWhere does the Dao/Way arise to give life?\nIt gathers the true and harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd all things follow to be born—\nThis is how the Dao/Way gives life—\nHence, it is said: *The Dao/Way gives life, virtue/power nurtures it.*\n\nWhere do forms arise?\nFollowing the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the transformations of yin and yang—\nAll things follow to be formed—\nThis is how forms arise—\nHence, it is said: *Form shapes it, conditions perfect it.*\n\nBecause the Dao/Way can give life,\nAll things bow to it—\nThis is called honoring the Dao/Way.\nBecause virtue/power can nurture life,\nAll things cannot belittle it—\nThis is called valuing virtue/power.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way and virtue/power dwell above the accumulated *yang*,\nNot seeking honor or nobility from things—\nThings honor and value themselves,\nFor from ancient times to the present,\nNo titles are bestowed yet they remain ever natural.\n\nTherefore, the Dao/Way gives life and nurtures it,\nLengthens it and rears it,\nPerfects it and ripens it,\nNourishes it and protects it—\nThis is the Dao/Way acting naturally between Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one gives life yet does not possess it,\nActs yet does not claim it,\nLengthens yet does not control it—\nThis is the common practice of Heaven and Earth,\nHence, it is called profound virtue/power.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: Heaven and Earth as the Origin of All Under Heaven**\nAll under Heaven has its origin,\nWhich we call the Mother of all under Heaven.\nHaving obtained its Mother,\nWe know its children—\nHaving known its children,\nWe return to guard its Mother,\nAnd thus our life is never endangered.\n\nBlock the *fui* (mouth/opening),\nClose the gate—\nAnd thus we never tire throughout our lives.\nOpen the *fui*,\nAdvance our affairs—\nAnd thus we never find salvation throughout our lives.\n\nSeeing what is small is called clarity,\nGuarding what is soft is called strength.\nUsing its light,\nYet returning to its clarity—\nWe suffer no harm to our bodies,\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nOne life of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd then all under Heaven has its origin—\nThus we call it the Mother of all under Heaven.\nHaving obtained Heaven and Earth,\nAs the Mother of all under Heaven,\nWe then know that all things are her children.\nHaving known her children,\nYet returning to guard the Mother—\nThen all her children are preserved.\n\nPeople only know Heaven and Earth and all things,\nYet do not know their own source of life.\nIf one knows this source,\nAnd returns to guard the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nThen one’s life is never endangered.\n\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth\nEngage in non-action,\nPractice the teaching of no words—\nHence, it is said: *Block the fui, close the gate,*\nAnd thus we never tire throughout our lives.\nThose who do not know the Dao/Way\nEngage in much speech and action,\nAnd thus lose guard of the Mother’s Dao/Way\nBy attending to worldly affairs—\nHence, it is said: *Open the fui, advance our affairs,*\nAnd thus we never find salvation throughout our lives.\n\nThe small is the uncarved of Heaven and Earth,\nThe soft is the subtle application of the Dao/Way—\nOnly by self-knowledge can one see the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nHence, it is called clarity.\nOnly by self-mastery can one guard the subtlety of the Dao/Way,\nHence, it is called strength.\n\nClarity is the harmonization of yin and yang,\nAnd light arises from clarity—\nUsing non-action,\nWithin oneself, wisdom and intent are present.\nThe Sage discards wisdom and knowledge,\nNot relying on them yet illuminating the Dao/Way of Heaven—\nHence, he uses its light\nAnd returns to its clarity.\nLight shining outward is called suffering harm—\nTo suffer no harm to oneself yet return to clarity,\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nThus, one can guard the Mother’s Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Thief of the Dao/Way**\nIf I were to have knowledge and walk the Great Dao/Way,\nI would only fear this one thing:\nThe Great Dao/Way is exceedingly smooth,\nYet people love shortcuts.\n\nMorning is neglected,\nFields grow overgrown,\nGranaries lie empty—\nYet they wear ornate attire,\nGird on sharp blades,\nSicken of food and drink,\nAnd hoard wealth—\nThis is called the thief of the Dao/Way,\nNot the Dao/Way itself.\n\nThe streams of mountain paths,\nIf used, become roads—\nIf not, are choked with weeds.\nThe people of the world do not know the subtlety of the Great Dao/Way,\nYet they act and contrive—\nThis is how they bring weeds to their hearts.\n\nKnowledge’s movement is called action,\nAction’s artifice is called loss—\nThus, those with knowledge fear and dare not act.\nThe Great Dao/Way is exceedingly smooth,\nYet when viewed, it is unseen—\nPeople’s hearts desire speed,\nThus they love shortcuts and forever stray from the Great Dao/Way.\n\nMoreover, the heart is the sovereign’s office—\nThus when the heart is disturbed, even a single *mu* (inch) of land is lost.\nWhen a single *mu* of land is lost,\nThe harmonious *qi* does not descend—\nWhen the harmonious *qi* does not descend,\nThe great granary is emptied—\nHence, it is said: *Morning is neglected, fields grow overgrown, granaries lie empty.*\n\nBecause of this,\nThey create distinctions of high and low,\nAnd strange contests of contention—\nThey crave the delicacy of the five flavors,\nHence, they wear ornate attire,\nGird on sharp blades,\nSicken of food and drink—\nAnd when wealth is abundant,\nThey gather the roots of all harm.\n\nThis is called the endeavor of robbing the Dao/Way and plundering the self,\nYet those who do not know\nStill boast of their own talents and abilities without ceasing—\nThis can be called *theft of boasting*, which is not the Dao/Way, is it?\n\n**Chapter 54: The Good Foundation Does Not Uproot**\n\nThe good foundation does not uproot,\nThe good embrace does not loosen—\nThus, descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nCultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true;\nCultivate it in one’s family, and its virtue/power becomes abundant;\nCultivate it in one’s village, and its virtue/power becomes enduring;\nCultivate it in one’s state, and its virtue/power becomes flourishing;\nCultivate it throughout the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal.\n\nTherefore, observe oneself through oneself,\nObserve one’s family through one’s family,\nObserve one’s village through one’s village,\nObserve one’s state through one’s state,\nObserve the world through the world.\n\nHow do I know this is so throughout the world?\nBecause of this.\n\nThe foundation is the one who creates beginnings and takes action.\nOnly the Dao/Way establishes virtue/power and discerns—\nIt stands firm, erecting heaven and earth, unshaken—\nThis is the moment when the One *qi* is divided into the Two Principles (阴陽/yin-yang).\n\nThe embrace is the one who adheres without separation.\nOnly virtue/power embraces the Dao/Way and gives birth—\nIt nurtures all things, unbroken—\nThis is the time when the One *qi* is dispersed to form myriad kinds.\n\nAll things share the same origin in the One *qi*,\nYet only humanity is most refined—\nThus, it becomes the progenitor of all things,\nThe origin of heaven and earth.\n\nIn this foundation and embrace, taking the world as One,\nDescendants will continue sacrifices without ceasing,\nAnd all within the Four Seas will come with their duties.\n\nThis Dao/Way, I trace its beginning—\nIt stems from cultivating oneself.\n\nOnce the Dao/Way’s truth is used to govern oneself,\nIts threads extend to the state,\nIts soil spreads to the world.\n\nFrom one self to the world,\nIts cultivation becomes ever broader,\nIts virtue/power ever more advanced.\n\nCultivating oneself: though the spirit resides in the body,\nIt first conceals heaven and earth,\nQuietly abides at the origin of all things,\nAnd lets the mind not dwell in the body—\nThis is what is meant by *cultivating oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true*.\n\nFrom this, though one is in the family,\nThe mind does not dwell in the family—\nThis is what is meant by *cultivating the family, and its virtue/power becomes abundant*.\n\nThough one is in the village,\nThe mind does not dwell in the village—\nThis is what is meant by *cultivating the village, and its virtue/power becomes enduring*.\n\nThough one is in the state,\nThe mind does not dwell in the state—\nThis is what is meant by *cultivating the state, and its virtue/power becomes flourishing*.\n\nThough one is in the world,\nThe mind does not dwell in the world—\nThis is what is meant by *cultivating the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal*.\n\nTherefore, *observing oneself through oneself* means\nIntrospecting deeply and gazing within to behold one’s own virtue/power.\n\nAs for observing one’s family, village, state,\nAnd even the world—\nThe Sage has no room for partiality in their heart,\nEach observes themselves naturally,\nThus attaining harmony effortlessly.\n\nHow do I know this is so throughout the world?\nBecause of this.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Profound Virtue of the Embracing Virtue**\n\nThe profound virtue of embracing virtue\nIs likened to the infant:\nPoisonous serpents do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nSnatching birds do not clutch.\n\nBones are frail, sinews supple, yet their grasp is firm;\nUnknowing of male and female union, yet erections arise—\nThis is the utmost of *jing* (精).\n\nCrying all day, yet the throat is unhoarse—\nThis is the utmost of harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy (*cháng* 常),\nTo know constancy is to know clarity (*míng* 明),\nTo take life as benefit is an omen (*xiáng* 祥),\nTo make *qi* strong with the heart is strength.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nThis is called *not-Dao*,\nAnd *not-Dao* perishes early.\n\nThe infant’s nature\nIs one with the Dao,\nIts heavenly defenses complete,\nIts spirit unbreached—\nThus the Sage does not lose the infant’s heart,\nAnd the profound virtue of embracing virtue\nCan be likened to the infant.\n\nSuch is the case:\nAccumulating virtue in mysterious passage,\nHidden in Heaven, and nothing can harm it—\nThus poisonous serpents do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nSnatching birds do not clutch.\n\nBones frail, sinews supple, yet grasp firm—\nThis is virtue complete in the Earthly Dao.\n\nEarthly *qi* begins at *zi* (子),\nThe infant’s frail bones and supple sinews yet firm grasp—\nThis is the pure *qi*’s defense responding to the Earthly Dao.\n\nUnknowing of male-female union yet erections arise—\nThis is the utmost of *jing*—\nVirtue complete in the constant Dao.\n\nThe constant Dao’s essence is most true:\nThe infant, unknowing of male-female union, yet sometimes erect—\nThis is the Dao’s true essence responding in humanity.\n\nCrying all day, yet the throat unhoarse—\nThis is the utmost of harmony—\nVirtue complete in the Heavenly Dao.\n\nHeaven governs sound,\nFor its undivided yin-yang *qi* is harmonious—\nThus it cries all day, yet the throat unhoarse.\n\nTo know harmony is to know yin-yang blending as one—\nThus it is called constancy (*cháng*).\n\nTo know constancy is to know yin-yang merging yet undivided—\nThus it is called clarity (*míng*).\n\nThe infant’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nIts virtue does not take life as benefit.\n\nTo reverse and take life as benefit—\nThis is the sign of entering the death-ground’s movement—\nThis is called an omen (*xiáng*).\n\nOnce life is taken as benefit,\nThen one must make *qi* strong with the heart—\nThis is the kind of rigid strength.\n\nBeginning with taking life as benefit,\nEnding with things reaching their peak and growing old—\nThis is called *not-Dao*,\nAnd *not-Dao* perishes early.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nThose who speak are not wise.\n\n「塞其兑，闭其门，挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘，\nThis is called *playing the role of the Mysterious Unity*—\nThus one cannot approach it too closely, nor keep it too distant,\nCannot profit from it, nor harm by it,\nCannot honor it, nor belittle it—\nHence it is most honored by the world.\n\nThe Dao/Way is naturally simple,\nThose who act can attain it,\nThose who hear can speak of it—\nYet why do they speak?\nSpeaking to attain it is merely the silent recognition of intent,\nNever seen in the verbose debates of eloquence—\nHence it is said: *The wise do not speak.*\n\nThose who do not know the Dao/Way,\nSpeak to trouble one another—\nWhen they neither hear nor speak,\nThey do not know how to attain it—\nHence it is said: *Those who speak are not wise.*\n\nOnly the Sage understands the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nPossessing great virtue yet never speaking of it—\nHence they *block their senses* and *close their gates*,\n*Plaster their orifices* and *guard their spirit* while *retiring into the hidden*.\n\nWhen they emerge to benefit the world,\nIn embodying the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nThey *dull their sharpness* and *harmonize their radiance*—\nIn embodying the Dao/Way of Earth,\nThey *resolve their tumult* and *blend with dust*.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is thus called *Mysterious Unity*—\nThe Mysterious Unity contains both bright and dark,\nHence it unites with the *Ultimate One* and aligns with Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven has no favorites,\nThus one cannot approach it too closely—\nAnd since one cannot approach it too closely,\nOne cannot keep it too distant either.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Earth has no desires,\nThus one cannot profit from it—\nAnd since one cannot profit from it,\nOne cannot harm by it either.\n\nThe Great Dao/Way has no form,\nThus one cannot honor it—\nAnd since one cannot honor it,\nOne cannot belittle it either.\n\nIf such is the case,\nThen it is fitting to be most honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Govern with Rectitude, Employ the Unusual**\n\nTo govern with rectitude,\nTo employ the unusual in warfare,\nTo take the world by doing nothing—\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nFor when the world abounds in taboos,\nThe people grow ever poorer;\nWhen people hoard sharp implements,\nThe state grows ever more corrupt;\nWhen people indulge in clever artifices,\nStrange things proliferate;\nWhen laws and decrees become explicit,\nThieves and robbers abound.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"I act without action, yet the people transform themselves,\nI do nothing, yet the people grow rich,\nI love tranquility, yet the people become upright,\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nIt is heard that the Sage *nurtures the world* with leniency,\nNot that they *govern the world*—\nFor the world cannot be governed,\nHence one must govern with rectitude and employ the unusual in warfare.\n\nRectitude itself becomes the unusual,\nThen there arises the calamity of warfare—\n*Blessing and disaster are intertwined*—\nWho can know their limits?\n\nTherefore the Sage takes the world by doing nothing.\n\nBy doing nothing, they follow Earth’s Dao/Way and love tranquility,\nBy loving tranquility, they follow Heaven’s Dao/Way and act without action,\nBy acting without action, they follow the Great Dao/Way and have no desires,\nBy having no desires, the world naturally returns to them.\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nFor governance arises from *action*—\nAnd when one loses the *Teaching of the Supreme Sage* that is *without words*,\nTaboos and prohibitions multiply—\nThus the four classes shift their occupations and grow ever poorer.\nThe people grow poor, and they seek sharp implements for profit,\nGreed and corruption flourish—\nThus the state grows ever more corrupt.\nIndulgence in clever artifices and rare treasures,\nStrange things proliferate—\nFrom this, profit and harm attack one another,\nLaws and decrees become explicit,\nSevere punishments reach their utmost—\nThe people have no respite for life,\nThus thieves and robbers abound.\nThe use of unusual warfare stems from this,\nThis is the extreme of governing with rectitude.\n\nTherefore the Sage does nothing,\nAnd the state is strong while the people are rich—\nThus taboos do not arise.\nLoving tranquility, the world naturally becomes upright—\nThus sharp implements are not created.\nActing without action, the ten thousand people transform themselves—\nWhat use are clever artifices?\nHaving no desires, the people return to simplicity—\nWhat thieves or robbers would there be?\nThis is the way of taking the world by doing nothing.\n\nTheir governance is *obscure and harmonious*—\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Their Governance is Obscure**\n\nTheir governance is *obscure and harmonious*,\nTheir people are *pure and simple*—\nTheir governance is *explicit and probing*,\nTheir people are *deceitful and cunning*.\n\nDisaster! *Blessing is its foundation*,\n*Blessing! Disaster is its seed*—\nWho can know their limits?\nIs there no rectitude or deviation?\nRectitude itself becomes the unusual,\nGoodness itself becomes *evil*—\nThe people’s confusion has lasted long.\n\nThus the Sage is *square without cutting*,\n*Clean without piercing*,\n*Straight without excess*,\n*Bright without dazzling*.\n\nIn the age of the *Supreme Sage*,\nThey dwell in *non-action*,\nPractice the *Teaching of the Unspoken*—\nThe world knows of their existence yet does not know of their governance,\nThus their governance is *without rectitude*—\nThose who naturally embody *obscure and harmonious* governance,\nHave governance yet do not enforce it.\n\nWhen governance is not enforced,\nIt is not to enlighten the people,\nBut to befuddle them—\nThus their people are *pure and simple*, as if naive.\n\nYet once governance is established to rectify,\nThere must be *explicit and probing* decrees—\nThus it begins with *obscure and harmonious* yet ends in *explicit and probing*.\nTo end in *explicit and probing* is the extreme of governance.\n\nWhen governance becomes too probing,\nThe people have no recourse—\nThus they become *deceitful and cunning*.\n\nThe Sage speaks only of seeking blessings,\nNever of punishing crimes—\nOnly of preserving life,\nNever of mutilating form—\nFor blessings and disasters are intertwined,\nThis is the natural order—\nHence it is said: *Who can know their limits? Is there no rectitude or deviation?*\n\nThe people of the world take governance as rectitude,\nNot knowing that rectitude’s extreme gives rise to the unusual—\nThey take blessings as goodness,\nNot knowing that goodness’s excess breeds *evil*—\nConfusion begets confusion,\nAnd this has lasted long.\n\nThus the Sage is *square like the thickness of great virtue*,\nHence they do not *cut*—\nClean like the purity of supreme virtue,\nHence they do not *pierce*—\nStraight yet not *applied outwardly*,\nBright yet *reflected inwardly*—\nNo rectitude to enforce,\nNo unusual to probe—\nThis is called the *Dao/Way without limits*.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Govern People, Serve Heaven**\n\nTo govern people and serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nFor only *frugality* is called *early return*—\n*Early return* is *accumulating virtue in earnest*—\nTo accumulate virtue in earnest is to have no failure—\nTo have no failure is to know no limits—\nTo know no limits is to have a lasting state.\n\nThe *foundation of a lasting state*,\nCan endure forever.»\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Deep Roots and Firm Foundations, the Dao of Longevity and Vision**\n\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of deep roots and firm foundations*,\nThe *Dao/Way of longevity and enduring vision*.\n\n*Frugality* (啬) is *restraint* (敛),\n*Accumulation* (畜),\n*Returning to virtue* (归之於德).\nExpressed outwardly, it is called *restraint*;\nSpoken inwardly, it is called *accumulation*.\n\n*Restraint* outwardly reaches *without desire*,\nThus they *postpone* their own bodies,\n*Externally* their own bodies,\nSo they may *govern people*.\n\n*Accumulation* inwardly reaches *without knowledge*,\nThus they *preserve* their hearts,\n*Nourish* their *nature* (性),\nSo they may *serve Heaven*.\n\nExternally, without desire, they follow the *stillness of Earth* (地) and *fulfill their nature* (尽性);\nInternally, without knowledge, they *embody Heaven’s functions* (体天之用) and *return to the original command* (复命).\n\nTo *fulfill their nature* (尽性) and *return to the original command* (复命),\nThis is *reverting back to guard its source*—\nHence it is called *early return* (早复).\n\n*Early* (早) means the sun rises at the *beginning of the Jia-Yang* (甲阳);\nTo *revert and guard its source* (复守其母),\nIs to *align with Heaven and Earth in virtue*—\nThis is called *accumulating virtue in earnest* (重积德).\n\n*Accumulating virtue* (积德) is *profoundly harmonious*,\n*Aligned with the true Dao* (与道合真),\nThus there is no failure—\n*Aligned with the true Dao* (与道合真),\nIt is *inexhaustible and boundless*—\nHence its limits are *unknowable*.\n\n*Inexhaustible and boundless* (难终难穷),\nAll ten thousand principles are *fully manifest*—\nHence it can *have a lasting state*.\n\nThe *foundation of a lasting state*,\nIs the *Dao/Way*—\nNeither *rigidly square* (不方) nor *circularly confined* (不圆),\nParallel with *Heaven and Earth*—\nHence it can endure forever.\n\n*Beginning with guarding its source* (始於守母),\nThis is called *deepening its roots*;\n*Ending with returning to the original command* (终於复命),\nThis is called *firming its foundation*.\nTo *obtain Heaven and Earth as constants* (得天地为常) while the *Five Phases do not mutually subdue* (五行不相克),\nTo *align with the Great Dao as One* (与大道为一) while the *Three Lights* (三光) remain *unilluminated and obscure* (无明冥),\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of longevity and enduring vision*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States Like Simmering Small Fish**\n\nTo govern great states,\nIs like *simmering small fresh fish* (烹小鲜).\n\nTo *apply the Dao/Way to rule the world* (以道莅天下),\nTheir *spirits* (鬼) are not *divine* (神).\nNot that their *spirits are not divine*,\nBut that the *divine spirits do not harm the people*;\nNot that the *divine spirits do not harm the people*,\nThe Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nThus, *both do not harm each other*—\nHence their *virtue/power* (德) *returns and exchanges* (交归).\n\nTo govern by the *Dao/Way* values *purity and clarity* (清浄),\nAnd the people *self-regulate* (民自定).\nDo not *act upon* them—\nHence, governing great states is like *simmering small fresh fish*.\n\nFrom the perspective of humanity,\nGreat states are *Heaven’s central earthly gateways* (天中地户),\nThe *domain of the Yellow Emperor* (黄帝之乡),\nThus they are governed in this manner.\n\nHence the Sage *acts in non-action* (处无为之事),\nWith a *single heart settled* (一心定),\nAnd *rules the world* (而王天下).\nThus the *spirits* have no place to *manifest their divine resonance* (出其灵响),\nRelying on humanity to move—\nWhat *divinity* is there?\n\nNot that their *spirits are not divine*—\nBecause they *do not receive evil* (不受於邪),\nEvil *qi* *spontaneously departs* (邪气自去),\nThus the *divine spirits do not harm humanity*.\n\nNot that the *divine spirits do not harm humanity*—\nBecause the Sage *acts in non-action*,\nAnd the world *transforms harmoniously* (化成),\nMaking the people *externally free from strife, contention, or warfare* (无争夺攻战之患),\n*Internally free from scheming, murder, or resentment* (无图为杀怨之心),\nNot *offending divine retribution* (不犯神之报应),\nThus the Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nWhen *humanity and spirits* (人与鬼神) *both do not harm each other*,\nThe *spirits* grant *abundant blessings* (予矣, 贻尔多福),\n*Returning virtue to the spirits*—\nThe people *simplify* (质矣),\n*Daily nourishment and sustenance* (日用饮食),\n*Returning virtue to humanity*.\n\n*Returning virtue to the spirits*,\nThus their descendants *sacrifice without ceasing* (子孙以祭祀不辍).\n*Returning virtue to humanity*,\nThus the world *joyfully follows* (天下乐推),\n*Never tiring* (而不厌).\n\nThis is the *effect* (效) of the Sage *applying the Dao/Way to rule the world*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**\n\nGreat states are *lowly flows* (下流),\nThe *nexus of the world* (天下之交),\nThe *receptive* (牝) of the world.\n\nThe *receptive* (牝) is always *stillness overcomes the active* (静胜牡),\nAnd *stillness is lowly* (静为下).\nThus, when great states *lower themselves to the small* (以下小国),\nThey *take the small*;\nWhen small states *lower themselves to the great* (小国以下大国),\nThey *take the great*.\nThus, *either lower to take* (或下以取),\n*Or lower and take* (或下而取).\n\nGreat states *do not exceed* their desire to *comprehend and nourish people* (兼畜人),\nSmall states *do not exceed* their desire to *enter and serve the great* (入事人).\nBoth *obtain what they desire*—\nHence the *great should be lowly* (大者宜为下).\n\nWater *excel in flowing downward*—\nThus the *Yangtze and seas can rule all valleys* (江海能为百谷王).\nGreat states desire to *comprehend and nourish people*—\nThis is also achieved through their *lowly flow*—\nHence it is said, *great states are lowly flows*.\n\nThe world’s *nexus* (交),\nAll things *generate*;\nHuman *nexus* (道交),\n*Merits and achievements are fulfilled*—\nThis is called the *nexus of the world*—\nYet it must *first be treated with gentleness and stillness* (自处以柔静).\n\nThe *receptive* (牝) is always *stillness overcomes the active* (静胜牡),\nAnd the *active* (牡) *returns to it*—\nBecause *stillness is lowly* (静为下).\n\n*Stillness* means *no affairs*—\nOnly *no affairs* can *take the world*—\nAnd what of *states*?\n\nThus, when great states *lower themselves to the small*,\nThey *take the small*;\nWhen small states *lower themselves to the great*,\nThey *take the great*.\n\n*Either lower to take* (或下以取),\nIs the *Dao/Way of the sovereign* (君道).\n*Or lower and take* (或下而取),\nIs the *Dao/Way of the minister* (臣道).\n\nThe *sovereign* is like *Heaven*—\nHeaven’s *Dao/Way* flows *downward to aid* (下济) while *radiant and clear*—\nThus great states *do not exceed* their desire to *comprehend and nourish people*.\n\nThe *minister* is like *Earth*—\nEarth’s *Dao/Way* is *lowly yet ascends* (卑而上行)—\nThus small states *do not exceed* their desire to *enter and serve the great*.\n\nWhen *Heaven and Earth exchange* (交),\nAll things *generate*;\nWhen *human nexus* (道交) is fulfilled,\n*Merits and achievements are completed*—\nThus both *obtain what they desire*.\n\nYet those who should *flow downward* (宜下流者),\nAre only great states—\nHence it is again said, *the great should be lowly*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**\n\nThe *Dao/Way* (道) is the *mystery of all things* (万物之奥),\nThe *treasure of the virtuous* (善人之宝),\nThe *protection of the unvirtuous* (不善人之所保).\n\n*Graceful words* (美言) can *win favor* (可以市),\n*Noble conduct* (尊行) can *elevate one* (可以加人).\nHumanity’s unvirtue—\nWhat can be *abandoned*?\nHence the *establishment of the Son of Heaven* (立天子),\nThe *appointment of the Three Ministers* (置三公),\nEven with *a jade tablet and white horses* (拱璧以先驷马),\nIs *not as valuable* as *sitting and presenting this Dao* (不如坐进此道).\n\nWhy did the ancients *value this Dao*?\nWas it not for *seeking and obtaining* (求以得),\nOr *pardoning faults* (有罪以免)?\n\nThus it is *precious for the world*.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is the *abyss of emptiness and nothingness* (虚无之渊),\nAll see *things* (物) yet *do not see the Dao* (不见乎道),\nHence it is called the *mystery of all things*.\n\nThe *mystery of attaining the Dao* (得道之妙),\nIs the *treasure of life and nature* (性命之宝).\nThe *mystery of speaking the Dao* (得道之言),\nIs unvirtue—\nYet even the unvirtuous *find protection in the Dao*.\n\n*Win favor* (市) is where *the masses gather* (众人之所归).\n*Elevate one* (加) is to *place them above the masses* (置诸众人之上).\nGraceful words and noble conduct—\nEven the unvirtuous in humanity,\nAre *sufficient to gain the masses and rise above them*.\n\nThe *Way* is not to be abandoned—thus the Son of Heaven establishes the Three Ministers and sits to discuss the Dao.\n\nIf one presents a jade tablet with four horses ahead, one may still attain noble speech and conduct, gather the masses, and rise above them. Yet even so, it is not as good as sitting and advancing the Dao of *wuwei*—for its subtlety surpasses all else.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao? Was it not because it is the treasure of life and nature—seeking it brings attainment, and it preserves life itself? Is it merely to pardon faults?\n\nThus, it is held precious by all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 63: *Wuwei* (無為)**\n*Wuwei* in action, *wuwei* in affairs, *wuwei* in taste.\nGreat and small, much and little—repay resentment with virtue.\nAttempt the difficult in its ease, achieve the great in its smallness.\nThe difficult things of the world arise from the easy;\nthe great things of the world arise from the small.\nThus the Sage never acts in greatness,\nand so achieves true greatness.\n\nLight promises bring few truths;\nmany easy things bring many difficulties.\nTherefore the Sage regards even the easy with caution,\nand so never faces true difficulty.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao of Heaven in silent teaching—\nthus *wuwei* in action;\nembodies the constant Dao in *wuwei* affairs—\nthus *wuwei* in affairs;\nembodies the Dao of Earth in simple joys—\nthus *wuwei* in taste.\n\nFrom the perspective of what it *appears* to do,\nit seems to have action, affairs, and taste.\nFrom the perspective of what it *holds*,\nits action is *wuwei*,\nits affairs are *wuwei*,\nits taste is *wuwei*—and nothing more.\n\nThe world does not understand this,\nso they act boldly and incur resentment,\nbegin with small things and reach greatness,\nbegin with little and reach abundance—\nall because they are fixated on deeds and desires.\n\nYet greatness and smallness, much and little,\nfollow their kind in return,\nall arising from self-attainment—\nHeaven and Earth respond like echoes.\nThus it is said: *Repay resentment with virtue.*\n\nFrom this, we see:\nThe world’s difficult things arise from the easy and become difficult;\nthe world’s great things arise from the small and become great.\nThus calamities arise unexpectedly,\ndisasters from the slightest threads—\nis this not so?\n\nTherefore the Sage aligns with Heaven to act with Heaven,\nand so never acts in greatness;\nunites with the Dao as one,\nand so achieves true greatness.\n\nThose who make light promises and act too easily\ndamage themselves by their recklessness in action—\nthus they lack trust and invite many difficulties.\n\nThe Sage practices silent teaching,\nso there is no lack of trust in action;\ndwells in *wuwei* affairs,\ndelights in simple joys,\nso there is no excess of difficulty;\nlets things unfold naturally without forcing—\nand so never faces true difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64: *An Ease to Hold***\nThat which is stable is easy to hold;\nthat which is not yet manifest is easy to plan;\nthat which is fragile is easy to shatter;\nthat which is subtle is easy to disperse.\n\nAct before things exist;\ngovern before things are disordered.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a sprout;\na nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth;\na thousand-*li* journey begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe doer brings ruin;\nthe grasper loses hold.\nThus the Sage acts in *wuwei* and knows no ruin;\nholds nothing and knows no loss.\n\nYet the people, in their affairs,\noften ruin what is nearly complete.\nIf one treats the end as carefully as the beginning,\nthere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nThus the Sage desires what others do not desire,\nvalues not what is hard to obtain;\nlearns what others do not learn,\nreturning to the errors of the common people,\naiding the natural unfolding of all things—\nand dares not act.\n\nBefore disturbances arise, it is easy to plan and hold—\nthis is *acting before things exist*.\nOnce fragility and subtlety have taken form,\nit is easy to disperse and scatter—\nthis is *governing before disorder*.\n\nYet to act before things exist—\ncan one truly avoid thought?\nTo govern before disorder—\ncan one truly avoid strategy?\n\nThus the Sage says:\nPlanning is the beginning of peril;\nperil, once begun, will not last long.\nBetter to take heed at the outset,\nforgetting the act before it begins,\nforgetting governance before it is needed—\nthis is the greater wisdom.\n\nGreatness arises from smallness,\nheight from lowliness,\ndistance from nearness—\nthis is the way of things.\n\nThe doer brings ruin;\nthe grasper loses hold.\nOnly the Sage, seeing the beginning,\nconsiders the end;\nglimpsing the path,\nknows the destination.\nThus *wuwei*—no ruin;\nno grasping—no loss.\n\nYet the people, in their affairs,\ncannot escape action and governance,\nand do not heed warnings.\nTheir desires grow ever stronger,\ntrue harmony exhausted—\nso they ruin what is nearly complete.\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nIf one treats the end as carefully as the beginning,\nreturns to the simplicity of an infant at its mother’s side,\nthere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nThus the Sage desires what others do not desire,\nseeks no external action—\neven rare treasures are not prized.\nLearns what others do not learn,\nseeks no internal mastery—\neven noble speech and conduct are not revered.\nReturns to the errors of the common people,\naids the natural unfolding of all things—\nand dares not act.\n\n**Chapter 65: *The Ancient Masters of the Dao***\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people—\nthey sought to keep them simple.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their cleverness is excessive.\nThus governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nnot governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nKnowing these two principles is the *mystic virtue*.\nThe *mystic virtue* is profound and distant,\ncontrary to things—\nand only then does it reach the greatest harmony.\n\nThe Dao, in *wuwei*, attains self-attainment within;\nthe Dao, in *wuwei* action, transforms without.\nThus the ancients who excelled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people—\nthey sought to keep them simple.\n\nEnlightenment corrupts the pure and brings chaos;\nsimplicity preserves the genuine and brings stillness.\nMoreover, the people can be led but not instructed.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their cleverness is excessive and their knowledge is great.\n\nCleverness is the tool of contention—\nthus governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state,\nnot because it is enlightening, but because it is clever.\nNot governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing,\nnot because it is simplifying, but because it is wise.\n\nThe ruin of the state lies in opening the people’s minds—\nopening the people’s minds is the ruin of life.\n\nThe blessing of the state lies in *opening heaven*—virtue gives life.\n\nThese two principles are models to emulate and patterns to follow. To know the models, one must then observe the Dao, hence it is called *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue). *Xuan De* is the highest virtue, thus profound and far-reaching. Nothing can pair with it except aligning with the great harmony, hence one must reverse with things to attain the great harmony.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (Jianghai)**\nJianghai becomes the king of all valleys because it excels in humility, thus it rules over all valleys. Therefore, the Sage desires to be above others by speaking humbly, to lead others by placing himself last. Thus, when the Sage is above, the people do not feel burdened; when he is before, the people are not harmed. Hence, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion. Because he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.\n\nJianghai, by its excellence in humility, receives the flow of all valleys and becomes their king. The king has the principle of returning and going, thus the noble humble themselves, the great humble themselves, and the people are gained.\n\nTherefore, the Sage embodies the Dao of Heaven and speaks humbly, so when he is above, the people do not feel burdened, hence they follow him lightly. He embodies the Dao of Earth and places himself last, so when he is before, the people are not harmed, hence those who benefit him are many. Thus, from the west to the east, from the south to the north, none fail to submit willingly, hence all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.\n\nEssentially, the reason for this is nothing more than excellence in humility. Only those who excel in humility do not contend with things, hence none under heaven can contend with them.\n\n**Chapter 67: All Under Heaven Say**\nAll under heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unskilled. Only because it is great does it seem unskilled. If it were skilled, it would have been long ago. I possess three treasures; I hold them fast. The first is *ci* (compassion), the second is *jian* (frugality), the third is *not daring to act first under heaven*.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous; frugality makes one vast. Not daring to act first under heaven makes one the vessel and leader. Now, if one abandons compassion and courage, abandons frugality and vastness, abandons humility and acting first, one dies.\n\nCompassion—when waging war, one wins; when defending, one is steadfast. Heaven, intending to save it, guards it with compassion. Those who imitate things are small; those imitated by things are great.\n\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, fills the six extremes, vast and great—thus it seems unskilled. Heaven is great, Earth is great; they imitate the Dao, hence they endure. Yet Heaven and Earth are but a small thing within the void—compared to the Dao, they are also small. Thus I hold fast to my three treasures.\n\nThe first, *ci* (compassion), is the fatherly Dao, the master of creation—speaking of Heaven. The second, *jian* (frugality), is the motherly Dao, the master of nurturing and gathering—speaking of Earth. The third, *not daring to act first under heaven*, is the origin of Heaven and Earth—responding only after being moved, never acting first—speaking of the Dao.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and the Dao together are used, then serene and boundless, with all virtues following. No treasures surpass these three. All people possess them; they should be cherished and not lost, held as the highest.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven gives birth and covers—this is called compassion. Though compassionate, it does not contend yet wins—thus compassion makes one courageous. The Dao of Earth nurtures and gathers—this is called frugality. Though frugal, its virtue extends boundlessly—thus frugality makes one vast.\n\nOnly the great Dao encompasses the origins of Heaven and Earth; though it does not dare act first under heaven, life and transformation depend on it, hence it becomes the vessel and leader. If one opposes Heaven and Earth and severs the great Dao, then one dies.\n\nCompassion in war brings victory—it battles *yin* with *yang*. In defense, it is steadfast—embracing the Dao of the Mysterious. Moreover, when contending with disorder, waiting for the time to act, then victory is achieved by responding. If it cannot move, it defends with harmony, and Heaven’s timing also guards it firmly, hence Heaven intends to save it, guarding it with compassion.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**\nThe virtuous warrior is not martial; the virtuous fighter does not rage; the virtuous victor does not contend; the virtuous user of people places himself below them. This is called the virtue of non-contention, the strength of using people, aligning with Heaven—ancient perfection.\n\nThe virtuous warrior cherishes the Dao of the three treasures, not using force to overpower under heaven with arms. Thus, in waging war, this is virtuous fighting; in defeating enemies, this is virtuous victory; in using people, this is virtuous leadership.\n\nThe virtuous fighter waits for the time before acting, though fighting yet not raging—embodying the treasure of compassion. The virtuous victor considers victory before meeting, though victorious yet not contending—embodying the treasure of frugality. The virtuous leader does not scheme for himself but delights in using others, hence people willingly serve him—embodying the treasure of *not daring to act first under heaven*.\n\nThose skilled in this are said to possess the virtue of non-contention, the strength of using people, aligning with Heaven. Yet ancient correctness becomes strange, thus there are warnings about using arms, hence it is called ancient perfection.\n\nWho knows its perfection?\n\n**Chapter 69: The Art of War**\nThe art of war has sayings: *I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender, not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.* This is called *no action in action, no arm in defense, no rival in enmity, no weapon in grasp.*\n\nNo greater calamity than despising the enemy—despising the enemy nearly loses my treasures. Thus, when armies clash, the compassionate win.\n\nThe sayings of war clarify that these words are not mine but the common words of those who use arms. *I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender*—thus pressed, I act; compelled, I rise, never provoking others, only responding.\n\n**Chapter 69 (continued): The Art of War**\n\nOnce compelled, it is not one who leaps forward to wage war but rather one who takes delight in killing—thus, he does not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot, hence the saying: *No action in action*.\n\n*Shoeless yet no arms*—this is to fight well yet not grow angry.\n*No rival in enmity*—this is to conquer the enemy yet not vie in conflict.\n*No weapon in grasp*—this is to skillfully employ others while placing himself beneath them.\nThis is the profound understanding of the **Three Treasures** (三宝).\n\nYet the **Three Treasures** are not solely about wielding arms—why must ancient perfection descend to the art of war?\nArms are cruel instruments; one must not lightly despise the enemy, for despising the enemy is to take delight in killing.\nAbandoning his **virtue/power** (德) yet embracing boldness, abandoning frugality yet seeking abundance, abandoning humility yet striving to be first—thus nearly losing his treasures.\nHence, when armies clash, those who pity and take compassion are **virtuous/powerful** (德), and if **virtue/power** (德) is held as treasure, there will be no calamity of despising the enemy, and thus victory is achieved.\n\n**Chapter 70: My Words Are Easy to Know and Practice**\nMy words are easy to know, easy to practice—yet none under Heaven can know them or practice them.\nWords have a **root/principle** (宗), matters have a **lord/master** (君).\nIt is only the ignorant who do not know me.\nFew know me, so I am precious.\nThus, the **sage** (圣人) wears coarse robes yet holds jade within.\n\nWithout thought or deliberation, one begins to know the Dao/Way—thus it is easy to know.\nWithout following or seeking, one begins to obtain the Dao/Way—thus it is easy to practice.\nYet the wealthy and noble of the world indulge in desires and lose their **authenticity** (真), while the poor and lowly labor excessively and harm their lives—all losing themselves to things, their nature to customs, hence none can know or practice them.\n\nWords having a **root/principle** (宗)—this clarifies the meaning of a chapter, its essence having a **root/principle** (宗)—is this not what is called easy to know?\nMatters having a **lord/master** (君)—this clarifies the practice of a chapter, its conduct having a **lord/master** (君)—is this not what is called easy to practice?\nIf one does not lose its **root/principle** (宗) and **lord/master** (君), why should he not be able to know or practice?\nThus, the **sage** (圣人) says: *If you practice my Dao/Way, you should know the **Supreme Wisdom** (上慧), for wisdom is not born alone—it arises through causes and conditions*.\nIf one lacks the **hosting roots** (行宿本) of practice, this is called *no knowledge*—how could he ever clarify the **Supreme Dao’s** (太上) profound and mysterious principles?\nThis is why few know me.\nThere are those who know without being told—seeing what others do not perceive—and those who obtain without study—seeing what others do not recognize.\nThus, those who know the Dao/Way are rare, proving that those who truly perceive are precious.\nHence, the **sage** (圣人) is slighted in outward appearance yet profound within, not flaunting himself before others, holding **Kunshan jade** (昆山之玉) yet few can recognize it.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**\nKnowing the unknown is praiseworthy;\nNot knowing the known is a flaw.\nIt is only because of this flaw that one avoids it.\nThe **sage’s** (圣人) avoidance of flaws is because he recognizes them as flaws—thus he avoids them.\nThe Dao/Way is inherently beyond knowledge; yet through **no thought and no deliberation**, one knows it—thus it is called *knowing the unknown*, which is true knowledge.\nOne who knows the knowledge of *knowing the unknown* is indeed praiseworthy.\nNot knowing the Dao/Way of *knowing the unknown*, yet claiming knowledge through lofty discourse and subtle theories, exhaustively probing roots and origins—his knowledge is flawed.\nOnly one who knows that *knowing the known as a flaw* is itself a flaw, and thus forgets his knowledge—this is why he avoids flaws.\nHow does the **sage** (圣人) never fall into flaws?\nBecause he knows that *knowing the known as a flaw* is itself a flaw, yet always acts as if he does not know—thus he avoids flaws.\nThe people do not fear great threats—\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Great Threats**\nThe people do not fear great threats—then the greatest threat has truly arrived.\nDo not confine their dwellings, do not weary of their birth.\nIt is only because of *not wearying* that one does not weary.\nThus, the **sage** (圣人) knows himself yet does not reveal himself, loves himself yet does not exalt himself—hence he discards that and takes this.\n\nAnger and threats—its threat is small;\nNo anger yet threats—its threat is great.\nThe **sage** (圣人) does not bend the world with threats, making the people fear threats in appearance yet hold reverence for **virtue/power** (德) in their hearts.\nThus, the silent threat of *not angering* is the greatest threat that arrives.\nTransforming the people to fulfill their nature—expanding and nourishing them, their dwellings are never confined;\nCultivating and completing them, their birth is never wearying—this is how the **sage** (圣人) embodies the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth** (天地道).\n\nEmbodying Heaven’s great threat yet not angering,\nEmbodying Earth’s broad dwelling yet not confining,\nEmbodying the Dao/Way’s eternal generation yet not wearying.\nOnly the **Supreme Sage** (上) does not weary of what the people produce—then the people also obtain fulfillment of their nature without wearying.\nThus, the **sage** (圣人) does not reveal himself—hence he is bright.\nOnly through brightness does one know oneself and embody Heaven and Earth.\nHe does not exalt himself—hence he is **virtuous/powerful** (德).\nOnly through **virtue/power** (德) does one love oneself and follow the Great Dao/Way—\nThus, he discards self-revelation and self-exaltation, taking instead the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth** (天地道).\n\n**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring Brings Death**\nBoldness in daring brings death;\nBoldness in not daring brings life.\nThese two outcomes—one beneficial, one harmful—\nWhat does Heaven abhor? Who knows its reason?\nThus, the **sage** (圣人) finds it difficult.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend yet conquers well,\nDoes not speak yet responds well,\nDoes not summon yet comes of its own accord,\nIs unassuming yet plans well.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and wide, sparse yet never misses.\n\nBoldness in daring and placing oneself before the world—this is called *contrary to Heaven’s Dao/Way*—thus death.\nBoldness in not daring and not placing oneself before the world—this is called *embodying Heaven’s Dao/Way*—thus life.\nYet boldness in not daring is beneficial to life yet harmful to worldly customs,\nBoldness in daring is beneficial to worldly customs yet harmful to life—\nIn the eyes of the world, one cannot escape doubt, hence they are confused.\nWhat does Heaven abhor? Who can truly know its reason?\nMoreover, Heaven’s Dao/Way diminishes excess yet benefits humility—\nThus, those who follow Heaven endure, while those who oppose it perish—\nHence, the **sage** (圣人) finds it difficult and does not dare to act.\nHeaven’s Dao/Way has no purpose—\nAll things emerging, it emerges with them without refusal;\nAll things returning, it returns with them without rejection—\nAll things receive their mandate from this, hence it is called *not contending yet conquering well*.\n\nThe four seasons proceed in their course, and all things are born—\nIndeed, it does not speak yet responds well.\n\nThe good are blessed by it, the licentious are doomed by it—\nIndeed, it does not summon yet comes naturally.\n\nIt shows humanity what is easily known,\nYet responds to all things with manifold changes—\nIndeed, it is straightforward yet well-planned.\n\nThe Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,\nThough sparse, it does not lose its prey—\nIs this not its way?\n\n**The People Do Not Long Fear Punishment (Chapter 74)**\nThe people do not long fear death—\nHow can one terrify them with death?\n\nIf the people were to always fear death,\nAnd yet someone dared to act strangely,\nI could seize and execute them—\nWho would dare?\n\nThere are always those charged with execution who execute.\nHe who substitutes for those charged with execution and executes,\nIs like one who substitutes for the great carpenter and chops.\n\nHe who substitutes for the great carpenter and chops,\nFew would escape unharmed.\n\nIf the people retain their nature,\nThey will always find joy in their lives;\nIf they lose their nature,\nWhat fear is there in death?\n\nEven if harsh laws are imposed to terrify them with death,\nThe people will resist and ultimately cannot be reformed.\n\nIf the people always fear death,\nIt means the governance allows them to retain their nature and know the joy of life,\nHence, they will not dare to commit serious crimes.\n\nIf there are those who act strangely,\nI could seize and execute them—\nWho would dare to act so?\n\nThere are always those charged with execution who execute,\nThis is called *virtue/power* (德) in governing with contracts.\n\nIf the people always fear death,\nAnd yet someone dared to act strangely,\nI could seize and execute them—\nThis is called *lacking virtue/power* (无德) in governing with contracts.\n\nThe people do not long fear death,\nYet one tries to terrify them with death—\nIs this not like substituting for the great carpenter?\n\nThe great carpenter who chops all things,\nIs the master of creation.\n\nThe master of creation,\nFollows Heaven’s Dao/Way of *non-action* (无为).\n\nThose who go against Heaven and control creation,\nAre those of *action* (有为)—\nFew would escape self-harm.\n\n**The People’s Hunger (Chapter 75)**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers taxing them too heavily—\nThus, they hunger.\n\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act—\nThus, they are hard to govern.\n\nThe people grow careless about death because their rulers provide them with abundant life—\nThus, they grow careless about death.\n\nOnly those who do not exploit life’s provisions,\nAre wiser than those who cherish life.\n\nThe king regards the people as Heaven,\nAnd the people regard food as Heaven.\n\nThe **sage**’s governance reduces punishments,\nLightens taxes and levies,\nKnowing Heaven’s Heaven,\nThen the people can be preserved.\n\nThe abundance of taxes arises from heavy burdens,\nYet the rulers do not know to lighten taxes and levies to nourish the people—\nThus, the people’s hunger.\n\nThe rulers’ *action* (有为) arises from their troublesome governance,\nYet they do not know to reduce punishments and levies to bring peace—\nThus, the people’s difficulty in being governed.\n\nIn general, human nature thrives in wealth and prosperity,\nThen steadfastness arises;\nReturns to simplicity and purity,\nThen other desires vanish.\n\nAs for hunger and difficulty in governance,\nThey do not secure their proper share,\nYet their desire for profit grows ever more insistent—\nThus, some are driven to excess in life and into the realm of death,\nHence, the people’s carelessness about death.\n\nOnly those who grasp the Dao,\nGuard within a single measure yet *qi* (氣) harmonizes naturally,\nTheir essence undiminished yet Heaven’s protection is complete.\n\nSuch people understand the nature of life,\nDo not pursue what cannot be done by *action* (有为),\nAre wiser than those who cherish life,\nAnd differ from those who exploit life’s abundance and grow careless about death.\n\n**The Nature of Human Life (Chapter 76)**\nHumanity’s living is soft and weak,\nYet its dying is firm and strong.\n\nGrasses and trees in their living are soft and brittle,\nYet in their dying, they wither and decay.\n\nThus, firm and strong are the companions of death,\nSoft and weak are the companions of life.\n\nHence, strong armies do not conquer,\nStrong wood is easily broken.\n\nThus, firm and strong must dwell below,\nSoft and weak must be above.\n\nHumanity’s living,\nBones are weak, sinews are soft,\nYet in dying,\nSinews and bones grow firm and strong.\n\nGrasses and trees in their living,\nBark is brittle, branches are soft,\nYet in dying,\nBranches and leaves wither and decay.\n\nThus, firm and strong are the companions of death,\nSoft and weak are the companions of life—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nStrong armies do not conquer,\nNor does strong wood endure—\nThis aligns with the same principle.\n\nFirm and strong are companions of death,\nThus, they dwell below.\n\nSoft and weak are companions of life,\nThus, they are above.\n\nThis is also the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth that ought to be so.\n\n**Heaven’s Dao/Way (Chapter 77)**\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is like drawing a bow—\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way diminishes excess and supplements deficiency,\nYet humanity’s Dao/Way is not so—\nThey diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nWho can diminish the excessive to serve the deficient in the world?\nOnly the Dao.\n\nThus, the **sage** acts yet does not rely on it,\nCompletes the task yet does not claim it—\nThis is why they do not seek to display their virtue/power.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way attains perfection through moderation,\nWithout excess or deficiency.\n\nIs it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, so they do not have excess—\nThus, the excessive are diminished.\nThe low are raised, so they do not lack—\nThus, the deficient are supplemented.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way reduces fullness and excess,\nSupplements emptiness and void,\nDestroys strength and vigor,\nBenefits decay and weakness—\nYet humanity’s Dao/Way is entirely contrary to this,\nDiminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nThose who can serve the world with the Dao of excess,\nOnly Heaven’s Dao/Way does so.\n\nThe **sage** embodies the Dao,\nThus, they act yet do not rely on it,\nComplete the task yet do not claim it—\nThey never use their strengths to display themselves to others,\nHence, they are always without harm,\nThis is how the **sage** can align with Heaven.\n\n**The Gentle and Weak in the World (Chapter 78)**\nIn the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nYet in attacking firm and strong things, nothing can surpass it,\nBecause there is nothing to replace it.\n\nThe gentle overcome the rigid,\nThe weak overcome the strong—\nAll in the world know this,\nYet none can practice it.\n\nThus, the **sage** says:\nTo bear the filth of the state,\nThis is the duty of the lord of the soil and grain;\nTo bear the misfortunes of the state,\nThis is the duty of the king of the world.\n\nStraightforward words as if reversed.\n\nIn the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nYet it can attack firm and strong things—\nNothing can overcome it,\nBecause it has constancy and nothing can replace it,\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\n\n**The Gentle and Weak in the World (Chapter 78, continued)**\nThe gentle overcome the rigid,\nThe weak overcome the strong—\nYet all in the world know this,\nAnd none can practice it.\nWhy so?\nBecause they increase life,\nAnd because their hearts command their **qi**,\nThus they lose the **Dao** of gentle and weak.\n\nNow, what is gentle and weak yet constant,\nAnd nothing can replace it?\nOnly the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth.\nThe **Dao** of Earth:\nBears the filth of the state,\nAnd does not transform itself—\nYet it transforms all else,\nThus it is called the lord of the soil and grain.\nIs this not what is meant by\n*The gentle overcoming the rigid?*\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven:\nBears the misfortunes of the state,\nAnd does not generate itself—\nYet it generates all else,\nThus it is called the king of the world.\nIs this not what is meant by\n*The weak overcoming the strong?*\n\nThat which is straightforward yet seems reversed—\nBearing the filth of the state and its misfortunes.\nWith straightforward words,\nIt seems reversed indeed.\n\n**Harmonizing Great Grievances (Chapter 79)**\nHarmonizing great grievances,\nMust leave some lingering resentment—\nHow can this be called good?\nThus, the **sage** holds the left half of the contract,\nAnd does not demand repayment from others.\n\nTherefore, one with **virtue** governs the contract,\nOne without **virtue** governs the final settlement.\nThe **Dao** of Heaven has no favorites,\nIt always aligns with those of virtue.\n\nYang is **virtue**—\nIt does nothing.\nYin is resentment—\nIt does much.\n\nIn the world, people act boldly in daring to do,\nThus they have resentment.\nAdding wisdom, kindness, and righteousness to harmonize great grievances,\nOnly makes resentment more abundant.\n\nIf this is so,\nHow can it be called good?\n\nMoreover, wisdom and kindness are external,\nRighteousness and propriety bring many demands—\nThus bold action leads to more resentment.\n\nTherefore, the **sage** follows Heaven’s course,\nDwelling in non-action,\nPracticing speechless teaching,\nGiving to others yet never taking—\nThus they do not demand repayment,\nAnd resentment has no place.\n\nThis is called the **virtue** of the **sage** above—\nTo bear resentment with **virtue**,\nThus it is said: *One with **virtue** governs the contract.*\n\nThis is called the **virtue** of the **sage** below—\nTo act boldly yet harmonize resentment,\nThus it is said: *One without **virtue** governs the final settlement.*\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven—\nThis is the **virtue** of the **sage** above—\nNo partiality, no bias,\nOnly those who act in non-action\nAre always favored by Heaven.\n\n**The Small State and Few People (Chapter 80)**\nA small state with few people,\nLets the people have tenfold and hundredfold tools,\nYet does not use them;\nLets the people value death,\nYet does not flee their homeland.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nThey have no place to ride them;\nThough there are arms and armor,\nThey have no place to display them;\nThey return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nThey delight in their food,\nAdorn their clothing,\nFind peace in their customs,\nTake joy in their livelihoods.\n\nNeighboring states are visible,\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nYet they do not visit one another,\nUntil they die of old age without meeting.\n\nNine corners, eight districts,\nSheltered within a small state.\nIn the age of supreme **virtue**,\nThe land is not expanded,\nThe people are not multiplied—\nYet they can make one state like a family,\nOne family like a single body.\n\nI love stillness,\nAnd the people naturally align.\nThough wise men may lead in front,\nAnd clever ones may confuse behind,\nThe people bear no burden of scheming—\nThus they are allowed to have tenfold and hundredfold tools,\nYet do not use them.\n\nIn such times,\nThe people all take joy in life,\nFind comfort in their native soil,\nGuard their own state—\nThus they value death,\nYet do not flee their homeland.\nBecause they do not flee,\nThere are no dangers of rivers and roads—\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nThey have no place to ride them;\nNo calamities of war—\nThough there are arms and armor,\nThey have no place to display them.\n\nGreat trust requires no oaths—\nWhat need for written contracts?\nThus they return to using knotted cords.\n\nTherefore, they diligently till the fields,\nAnd find their food sweet;\nThey personally tend the mulberry trees,\nAnd find their clothing fine;\nThey cherish their homeland,\nAnd find their dwelling secure;\nThey preserve life,\nAnd find their customs joyful.\n\nThough their dwellings are close,\nAnd their voices are heard,\nThey do not visit one another—\nNo desires, no demands—\nThey act without pretense,\nYet all things naturally unfold.\nThis is called supreme **virtue**.\n\n**The Sage’s Speech is Not Ornate (Chapter 81)**\nThe **sage’s** words are not ornate,\nOrnate words are not **sage**.\nThe good do not argue,\nThe argumentative are not good.\nThe wise do not display vast knowledge,\nThe learned are not truly wise.\n\nThe **sage** has no accumulation—\nThe more they give to others,\nThe more they possess;\nThe more they share with others,\nThe more they have.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven:\nBenefits without harming.\nThe **Dao** of the **sage**:\nActs without competing.\n\nThe **sage’s** words are few—\nWhen they speak,\nTheir words are simple, without taste—\nThus they are not ornate.\n\nOrnate words are mere appearances—\nWhen they deal with others,\nLight promises bring few trustworthy deeds—\nThus they are not trusted.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not speak,\nYet always responds with goodness—\nThus the good do not argue.\n\nHarmonizing great grievances—\nHow can this be called good?\nThus the argumentative are not good.\n\nThose who know the **Dao** must reach the **principle**—\nReaching the **principle** means they will use reverse speech to govern.\nThus the wise do not display vast knowledge.\n\nKnowledge that is too broad confuses the mind—\nThe more one hears and sees,\nThe less they can grasp the essential—\nThus the learned are not truly wise.\n\nNot ornate,\nNot argumentative,\nNot vast in knowledge—\nThis is called *having nothing to dwell upon within oneself.*\n\nThe **Dao** of the **sage** is to have nothing to dwell upon within oneself—\nThus they move without accumulation,\nAnd the **sage** has no accumulation.\nBecause of accumulation, they are insufficient;\nBecause of no hoarding, they have abundance.\n\nThe **sage** has no accumulation—\nThus they can use the **Dao** of abundance\nTo nourish the world.\nAll under Heaven come to depend on them,\nYet they are never exhausted—\nThus the more they give to others,\nThe more they possess;\nThe more they share with others,\nThe more they have.\n\nThe **Dao** of the **sage** is the **Dao** of Heaven—\nThe **Dao** of Heaven benefits without harming,\nThus the **Dao** of the **sage** acts without competing.\n\nMoreover, Heaven uses beauty and benefit\nTo benefit the world—\nWhat harm could there be?\nThe **sage** emerges from non-action,\nYet does not disrupt Heaven’s natural order,\nNor go against the inclinations of things—\nAgain, what is there to compete over?\n\nThis is the *De Jing* speaking,\nAnd its words conclude here—\nBecause **virtue** encompasses the **Dao**,\nAnd the **Dao** encompasses Heaven.\nIf one does not understand Heaven,\nThey will not grasp the **sage**—\nThus the *Mixed

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.\nTo give life and take it in due season—this is the Dao of things;\nTo cultivate virtue and deeds—this is the Dao of humanity;\nTo distinguish male and female—this is the Dao of the family;\nTo establish laws and measures—this is the Dao of the state.\nThese are the Constant Dao of the world,\nShared by both Sage and commoner alike.\n\nYet the Dao that can be spoken of—\nResponsive without hindrance, boundless in its transformations,\nNeither ear nor eye can grasp its subtle essence:\nTo perceive its faintest traces is to fathom its divine metamorphosis;\nTo know its farthest reach is to penetrate its unfathomable truth.\nIn motion, it responds to ten thousand affairs;\nIn stillness, it does not stagnate in one form—\nHow could the Constant Dao ever be thus?\n\nThe Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\nThe Eternal Name does not cling to form—\nFor form has cycles of flourishing and decline;\nThe Eternal Name does not reside in numbers—\nFor numbers have limits and must change.\nThus, the Name that can be named cannot be seized,\nCannot be mirrored in likeness,\nCannot be followed to see its beginning or end—\nPierced from above or below, it remains firm,\nIts height beyond reach.\nIt does not conform to things yet remains fixed,\nIts substance is functional,\nExisting in the Constant Non-being,\nIn harmony with the Dao—\nAnd thus the Name arises, yet it is not the Eternal Name.\n\nNon-being is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nBeing is the mother of ten thousand things.\nBefore the Dao was distinguished,\nNeither yin nor yang could be spoken of,\nNor could creation and transformation be traced.\nWhen *qi* settled in clarity, it became Heaven;\nWhen *qi* settled in turbidity, it became Earth.\nHeaven and Earth, in their dual attainment,\nCalled clarity *yang*—the power to create—\nAnd turbidity *yin*—the power to transform—\nThus all things are born.\n\nIn Non-being, the Dao stands alone, and Heaven and Earth attain it—\nThis is why Non-being is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nIn Being, Heaven and Earth unite, and all things are born—\nThis is why Being is the mother of ten thousand things.\nAt the beginning, it is spoken of as *qi*;\nAs the mother, it is spoken of as form—\n*Qi* and form—\nAlso the Dao’s Being and Non-being.\n\nTo observe its mystery, one must hold fast to Non-being;\nTo observe its limits, one must hold fast to Being.\nThese two, though differing in name, arise from the same source—\nBoth called *Xuan* (the Profound).\nThe Profound, again the Profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\nIt comes indistinctly—from where does it come?\nIt departs indistinctly—where does it go?\nEmpty, yet not lodged in any single thing;\nVoid, yet not reflected in any single form—\nThis is the Constant Non-being.\n\nIt comes indistinctly—yet its coming must have a manifestation;\nIt departs indistinctly—yet its departure must have a substance.\nEmpty, yet the spirit gathers within it—\nMotionless yet moving.\nVoid, yet the True is contained—\nUnchanging yet transforming—\nThis is the Constant Being.\n\nConstant Non-being is the practice of *wuwei* (non-action);\nConstant Being is the cultivation of action.\nNon-action leads to the Mysterious,\nAction leads to the Manifest—\nThese two, though differing in name, arise from the same source.\n\nIn essence, can they not both be called *Xuan*?\nFor *Xuan* is the Dao made visible—\nLike the sky’s hue, seen yet its nature unknown.\nThe Profound, again the Profound—\nTo attain it again and again,\nAnd to penetrate it ever deeper—\nThus it is called the gateway to all mysteries,\nFor it enters and exits the Great Dao.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nThen wickedness arises.\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low contrast each other,\nHarmony and discord blend,\nBefore and after follow.\nThe Dao disperses through affairs,\nThings intermingle in nature.\nAt first, they receive the True,\nYet humanity corrupts it into falseness;\nAt first, they inherit harmony,\nYet it becomes discordant.\nThus, what was once beautiful becomes ugly,\nWhat was once good becomes ungood—\nThe two paths of beauty and ugliness,\nGoodness and ungoodness, diverge.\n\nThe Sage does not, because of ugliness, cease to recognize beauty,\nNor, because of ungoodness, cease to recognize goodness—\nOnly to fulfill their nature,\nNot to follow the common crowd in distinguishing beauty from ugliness,\nGoodness from ungoodness.\nIf one seeks to unify them,\nThen nature attains its utmost—\nAnd what of being and non-being,\nDifficulty and ease,\nLong and short,\nHigh and low,\nHarmony and discord,\nBefore and after?\nThis is the Sage’s teaching,\nAnd thus it is practiced.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in non-action,\nTeaches through non-speech.\nThe Sage governs himself with the Dao,\nAnd bestows deeds upon others.\nFor those without foresight,\nThey await the Sage to think for them;\nFor those without insight,\nThey await the Sage to see for them.\nIf not guided by teaching,\nThey grow soft and drown themselves,\nFoolish and weaken themselves,\nUnable to follow the Sage’s Dao.\n\nI store my spirit in profound silence,\nYet let them move with the wind’s influence;\nI dwell in still contemplation,\nYet let them act in response to transformation.\nTo ponder affairs exhausts one’s clarity—\nI have no affairs;\nTo speak much disrupts the True thread—\nI speak not.\nNaturally, affairs are accomplished below,\nTeaching established above—\nAnd though the people are not commanded, they act in harmony,\nFor there is no reversal of the Dao.\n\nAll things act without complaint,\nThe Sage emerges, and all things emerge;\nThe Sage withdraws, and all things withdraw.\nThe Sage is what all things behold.\nThus, when the Sage is above,\nAll things flourish yet each fulfills its nature,\nWithout blame for losing their essence.\nFor I do not exert my mind—\nOnly to follow the natural order of things,\nUntil rise and fall have no words to describe them.\n\nIf governance is unrefined,\nIf teaching is unclear,\nThen the Sage must emerge and withdraw,\nMust take and give as needed—\nDisturbing the hearts of all under Heaven,\nDisordering the forms of all things.\nEven then, though acting, there is no complaint.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when the people of the world have no false knowledge to see by,\nand the people of the world have no frivolous desires to seek,\nthen the Sage’s actions will leave nothing ungoverned.\n\nTherefore, the chapter *\"Not Exalting the Virtuous\"* restores human nature,\nreverses the ways of things,\nand takes root in the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao is Void Yet Applied**\n\nThe Dao is void yet applied—\nsometimes it does not fill.\n\nWhen the Dao expands, it suffices the four quarters yet is not full;\nwhen the Dao contracts, it hides in the minutest things yet is not minute.\n\nIn essence, it attains supreme emptiness—\nall that comes to it finds response.\nIn application, it attains supreme transformation—\nall that arrives finds reception.\n\nIt does not tower too high—\nfor the low cannot reach it;\nit does not stoop too low—\nfor the high cannot descend to it.\nThus, not only does it not fill,\nbut it also does not endure long—\nunless one abides in the balance of yin and yang,\nhow could this be possible?\n\nHence it is said:\n*The Dao is void yet applied—\nsometimes it does not fill.*\n\nVoidness means the balance of yin and yang,\nfree from excess or deficiency.\n\nProfound, it seems the origin of all things.\nDeep and unfathomable—this is called *profound*;\nsubtle and inexhaustible—this is called *Dao*.\n\nWhen the Dao is absent, heaven and earth take it as their beginning;\nwhen the Dao is present, all things take it as their mother.\nSpeak of it as mother, and one knows all things arise from the Dao;\nspeak of it as origin, and one knows all things derive from the Dao.\nYet if it is their origin, why say it *seems* so?\nFor the Dao has no form—\nit cannot be defined by a fixed body,\nthus it is said: *Profound, it seems the origin of all things.*\n\nBlunt its sharpness, resolve its entanglements,\nsoften its brilliance, harmonize with its dust—\nserene, it seems to exist.\n\nWhen one abides in the Dao,\nrestraining the mind’s wildness in emptiness,\nsettling the nature’s source in stillness,\nconcealing joy and anger in the realm of non-doing,\nlocking likes and dislikes in the land of non-thought,\nthen one dwells in simplicity within oneself,\nand meets things with tranquility.\n\nNot displaying clarity outwardly,\nit harmonizes yet seems obscure;\nnot standing apart from the crowd,\nit unifies yet seems foolish.\n\nThus, in the Dao,\none sees without looking,\naccomplishes without acting,\nand bears no burden of things.\n\nIf one does not blunt its sharpness and instead relies solely on intention,\none will surely grow light and injure one’s nature;\nif one does not resolve its entanglements and instead relies solely on affairs,\none will surely be troubled and disrupt one’s true essence;\nif one does not soften its brilliance, the Dao will fail through arrogance;\nif one does not harmonize with its dust, reputation will fail through arrogance.\n\nThus, in the Dao,\none looks yet does not see,\nacts yet does not accomplish,\nand is always burdened by things—\nthose who study it should not be negligent!\n\nThis is why, after the four practices,\nit is followed by: *Serene, it seems to exist.*\n\nThe Dao has no fixed form—\nif one speaks of it merely as *existing*,\nit is not the Dao,\nthus it is said *seems to exist*.\n\nI do not know whose child I am—\nI precede the Sovereign of the Primordial.\n\nObserving the Dao’s origin,\nit arises from non-action,\nis born of purity and stillness,\nis held onto and preserved,\nabandoned and lost.\nIt does not forcefully multiply,\nnor does it weakly diminish—\nthus, it attains the utmost of emptiness,\nthe marvel of true constancy.\nThough heaven and earth take me as their beginning,\nthough all things

things—\nhow could I be named as a child?\nThus it is said: *I do not know whose child I am—\nI precede the Sovereign of the Primordial.*\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\n\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—\nthey treat all things as sacrificial straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not benevolent—\nthey treat the people as sacrificial straw dogs.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nit is like a bellows, is it not?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever producing.\n\nHeaven and earth, toward all things,\nlet their natural order take its course.\nWhen their time to live comes, they give life,\nnourishing them with dew and rain;\nwhen their time to die comes, they bring death,\nwithering them through frost and snow.\nThus, they are not bound to any single thing,\nnor burdened by any single time—\nthey simply await the unfolding of their nature.\n\nThey are called *straw dogs* because,\nwhen sacrifices are made,\nthey are offered with utmost sincerity and reverence.\nBut once the rites are over,\nthey are discarded as worthless—\ntreated like dung and filth.\nThis is not about loving them more at first and less at the end,\nnor cherishing them before and hating them after—\nit is simply the way of their nature.\n\nThe Sage’s relation to the people is no different.\nWhen love is given, it is like cherishing an infant;\nwhen respect is given, it is like receiving a grand sacrifice—\nno love is greater than this.\n\nBut when there are those not loved,\npunishment is meted out to display authority,\nand life is regarded as trivial.\nWhen there are those not respected,\nexecutions are carried out to eliminate guilt,\nand existence is seen as insignificant—\nthis is not the Sage’s sentiment toward rewards and punishments,\nbut rather the natural unfolding of their order,\nin harmony with heaven and earth.\n\nIf it were otherwise,\nhow could one receive all things without exhaustion,\nor embrace all changes without drowning?\n\nTo love life is to give life without depletion;\nto desire goodness is to foster goodness without end.\nIts responses are boundless,\nits emergence inexhaustible—\nlike the bellows, ever producing.\nThus it is said: *Empty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever producing.*\n\nMany words lead to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold to the center.\n\nThe Sage acts by applying the Dao,\nand remains still by embodying the Dao.\nIn stillness, they align with the Dao,\nserene and self-nourishing,\nnot engaging with affairs,\nnot interfacing with things—\nwhat harm could words bring?\n\nWhen they act and apply the Dao,\nno words suffice to meet the changes—\nthen the Dao reaches its limits.\nThough words may be praised,\nthey must be concise to fit the principle,\nessential to align with the Dao,\nnot indulging in excess for its own sake.\nThus it is said: *Many words lead to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold to the center.*\nIs this not the way?",

Root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEndless as silk, yet ever present,\nits use requires no toil.\nEmpty yet responsive—\nits response is boundless;\nwondrous yet unfathomable—\nits measure has no bounds.\n\nFor the Valley is that which responds to all things\nyet clings to none.\nThe Spirit is that which receives all transformations\nyet lingers in no origin.\n\nNot clinging to any thing,\nits emptiness never fills—\nwhat loss could there be?\nNot lingering in any origin,\nits transformation never exhausts—\nwhat end could there be?\n\nThus the Valley Spirit bears the sign of immortality—\nthis is called the Mysterious Feminine.\n\nThe Dao in its relation to humanity\nbegins with the formless and ends with the formed.\nThe formless is spoken of as *qi*,\nthe formed is illustrated by shape.\nThe Mysterious Feminine is the formed aspect of this.\n\nWithin the human body, the Mysterious Feminine is the source of life.\nEmpty, it responds to our movements;\nwondrous, it perfects our transformations.\nThat which descends returns through it,\nthat which departs returns through it.\nThus the vital *qi* flows unbroken,\nthe true essence remains tranquil—\nand the principle of longevity is realized.\n\nYet why cannot humanity live?\nNot because the Mysterious Feminine is lacking—\nbut because humanity cannot be empty and still.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven’s Duration, Earth’s Longevity**\n\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nHeaven and Earth endure and persist\nbecause they do not generate themselves—\nthus they attain eternal life.\n\nTherefore the Sage places his body last\nand yet his body is first;\nsets his body aside\nand yet his body is preserved.\nIs this not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his own nature.\n\nHis essence is supremely high—\nhe aids all living beings yet claims none.\nThis is how Heaven endures.\nHis nature is vast and thick—\nhe bears all things yet does not refuse.\nThis is how Earth persists.\n\nHeaven endures, covering all ages without tipping;\nEarth persists, bearing past and present without sinking.\nThis is not because Heaven and Earth inherently endure and persist—\nrather, they do not claim their own life,\nand thus endure naturally.\n\nThe Sage embodies Heaven and Earth,\naspires to eternal life—\nhow could he dare claim his own body?\nThus he lowers himself to the lowly,\nharmonizes his brilliance with the common,\nthough knowing he is first,\nhe does not dare to lead others\nbut always remains behind.\nThough his body is sage,\nhe does not dare to surpass others\nbut always conceals his traces.\nThus he places his body last and yet his body is first;\nsets his body aside and yet his body is preserved.\nTherefore he fulfills his own nature\nand aligns with Heaven and Earth’s enduring longevity.\n\nIf not for this selflessness,\nhow could one speak of this?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water**\n\nThe supreme good is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend—\nit dwells where others disdain,\nand thus approaches the Dao.\n\nIt rests in lowly places,\nits heart is deep,\nits giving is kind,\nits words are trustworthy,\nits governance is effective,\nits actions are capable,\nits movements are timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend\ndoes it incur no blame.\n\nIn the past, the Dao was above—\nindistinct yet without form,\nwithout distinction,\nyet its purity was undefiled.\nWhen it separated from the formless and entered the formed,\nin terms of nature, goodness remained;\nin terms of the Five Phases, water emerged—\nand goodness and water thus drew near to the Dao.\nThis is why they are compared and established,\nhence it is said: *The supreme good is like water.*\n\nGoodness is called nature—\nforgetting the mind and entering stillness,\nclearing oneself to benefit others,\nhiding the roots of contention,\nas if it were inherent—\nno taking, no giving,\nas if natural.\nWhen sought, it responds,\nyet does not respond to frivolous seeking.\nWhen still, it gradually clears,\nyet does not clear through forced stillness.\nDeep in its own understanding,\nbright yet guarding obscurity,\nit reaches the benevolence of aiding others,\nthe certainty of trust,\nthe governance of following principle,\nthe capability of adapting to change—\nall are the unifying work of water.\n\nIn essence, this chapter conveys\nthe meaning of *upper virtue not being virtue*,\n*upper worthies having no contention*.\n\nFor instance:\nTo rest in lowly places—\none must descend to the low.\nA heart that is deep—\nwater deepens and flows back.\nGiving that is kind—\nbenefiting all things.\nWords that are trustworthy—\nnot deceiving others externally.\nGovernance that is effective—\ngrasping softness to overcome hardness.\nActions that are capable—\nferrying all with boats and oars.\nMovements that are timely—\nacting when it should, stopping when it should.\n\nAll these virtues—\nif one clings to them and strives to surpass others,\none is bound to incur blame.\nHow could one then approach the Dao?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: Filling to the Brim**\n\nFilling to the brim\nis not as good as stopping in time;\nsharpening to a point\ncannot be long preserved.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nwhen measured, it is never exhausted;\nwhen poured, it never overflows.\nNo lack makes it insufficient,\nno excess makes it redundant.\nAll is emptied within to avoid fullness,\nhollowed within to receive things—\nwhy cling to fullness as if it were restraint?\n\nIf one clings to fullness,\nit is better to stop in time.\nThe affairs of the world\ncome and go in cycles,\nnew replacing old,\ntheir appearances and disappearances too numerous to count,\ntheir benefits and harms

      "translated_text": "「If one treasures them, how can there be no calamity? When achievement is complete and reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven. The seasons cannot always be in motion; when they move, there must be a pause. Affairs cannot always flourish; when they rise, there must be decline. Yet human advancement and retreat have their proper *yì* (義), which can be followed but not defied; departure and approach follow one’s *mìng* (命), which can be aligned with but not contradicted. If one can retreat when *yì* demands it yet advances against *yì*, harm will surely follow. If one can depart when *mìng* requires it yet clings to what *mìng* rejects, loss will surely come. How can one rely on advancement to secure lifelong honor, yet ignore the specter of sorrow and misfortune? This is the way of achievement complete, reputation fulfilled, and withdrawal—Heaven’s Dao.\n\n**Chapter 10: On Nourishing the Vital Essence and Embracing Oneness**\nCan one nourish the vital essence and embrace oneness without separation?\nSince receiving one’s *mìng* (命), the Perfect One preserves their *shén* (神) afterward. Within one body, yin and yang are complete; in the four great elements, creation and transformation are whole. Their nature attains the harmony of *érchōng* (爾沖), and their *qì* (氣) returns to its true and authentic essence. What then is the harm of external things?\nThis is the principle of life.\n\nYet when the *shén* (神) follows change and transformation, thoughts arise from things, desires sprout in the chest, and toil lingers within the body. The harmony they once held shifts to discord, and the true essence becomes perverted into falsehood. Then the *shén* (神) is seized by the *pò* (魄), unable to nourish it, and thus disperses and scatters, failing to preserve itself—this is the way of death.\n\nThe Perfect One knows this to be so. They forget worldly concerns, extinguish the dusty mind, and recognize that the *shén* (神) is their sovereign. Thus, they remain tranquil and undisturbed, reaching clarity. Knowing that the vital essence is their foundation, they stay at peace and unshaken, attaining oneness. Only then does their *shén* (神) penetrate to the numinous and not be deceived, their vital essence preserved in authenticity and becoming dual—internally free from the *pò* (魄)’s burden, externally free from things’ sway. Then the Dao will not soon perish.\n\nAlas, the foolish and ignorant! They turn their backs on yang and face yin, extinguish the *shén* (神) and submit to the *pò* (魄), racing through endless change and labor, yet failing to guard the Perfect One’s vital essence. When death comes, they sink into the yin Dao, falling into the realm of *yìshēng* (異生). This is because they are burdened by the *pò* (魄) yet cannot embrace oneness to preserve themselves. How lamentable! How lamentable!\n\n**Chapter 11: On Concentrating the Vital Essence and Attaining Softness**\nCan one concentrate the vital essence to attain softness like an infant?\nHumans preserve life by nourishing their *qì* (氣); they hasten death by depleting their *qì* (氣).\nThe noble does not harm life by harming others, so they concentrate the vital essence to attain softness, preserving their true nature.\n\nMoreover, the Perfect One’s nature is accustomed to stillness; movement brings sorrow and joy. The Perfect One’s nature is content with non-contradiction; contradiction sparks violent rage. Sorrow and joy arise, and the emotions within become disordered; violent rage stirs, and the *qì* (氣) within becomes agitated. Such is the way of those who fail to nourish the true.\n\nHow then does one concentrate the vital essence to attain softness?\nNothing surpasses directing it with the will, guiding it with the *shén* (神), keeping the heart in purity and tranquility, and focusing the will on emptiness and ease. Binding the five thieves in the land of no attachment, imprisoning *wúmíng* (無明) in the realm of utter weakness—only then does the *qì* (氣) align with softness and remain unmoved by external stimuli. What else could this be but the state of an infant?\n\n**Chapter 12: On Purifying and Illuminating the Mysterious**\nCan one purify and illuminate without flaw?\nThe nature has its filth, which can be cleansed; the nature has its impurities, which can be removed.\nUnless one cultivates purity to nourish themselves and stillness to face things, how could this be?\n\n**Chapter 13: On Loving the People and Governing the State**\nCan one love the people and govern the state without action?\nGovernance rooted in non-action (*wúwéi* 無為) spawns falsehood from contrivance (*yǒuzuò* 有作). When humans stray from their nature, they lose their foundation; when enslaved by things, they lose themselves.\nTo love the people and preserve life, to govern the state and maintain lasting peace, nothing surpasses letting them dwell in their nature and not act.\n\n**Chapter 14: On the Opening and Closing of the Heavenly Gate**\nCan one act as the feminine in the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate?\nAll things enter and exit through Heaven’s gate; Heaven’s gate opens and closes through the Dao.\nThe Perfect One responds to Heaven’s gate, entering and exiting the mysterious realm, traversing the Dao’s threshold while ascending and descending in the true world. They harmonize with the ebb and flow of time, aligning with things’ waxing and waning—not through arbitrary action, but by dwelling in heartless stillness.\n\n**Chapter 15: On Clarity and Fourfold Reach**\nCan one be clear and fourfold without knowing?\nTo illuminate the hidden is clarity; to perceive the unadorned is whiteness; to flow unrestricted is fourfold reach. Such is true knowing.\nYet knowing while not knowing—this is the utmost.\n\n**Chapter 16: On Nurturing and Tending**\nTo nurture and tend—giving birth without possession, acting without reliance—\nthe Dao has its creative force, by which all things are born;\nthe Dao has its transformative power, by which all things are sustained.\nYet the Dao can nurture and tend to all things only if one truly comprehends it. Otherwise, it cannot be imitated.\n\n**Chapter 17: On the Long and the Unharmed**\nTo grow long without slaughter—this is called the mysterious *dé* (德).\nTo endure for ten thousand generations without wear—this is the Dao. Is it not long?\nNon-action yet all things transform—is this not without slaughter?\n\n**Chapter 18: On the Thirty Spokes and the Single Hub**\nThree hundred spokes converge at a single hub; when the hub is absent, the wheel’s use remains. Clay is molded into vessels; when the void is absent, the vessel’s utility is lost. Doors and windows are carved for rooms; when the void is absent, the room’s stability is gone. Thus, the presence of things brings utility, but the void brings true use.\n\nThe wheel has the principle of movement and turning yet does not cling to matter; vessels have the name of gathering yet do not scatter outward; rooms are the constant dwelling place and achieve inner tranquility. These are but examples of the use of the void.\n\nMoreover, what exists beyond form is called the Dao; what exists below form is called things.\nWhen the Dao is beyond form, non-action is its use—its use is boundless, and there is no depletion from new or old.\nWhen things are below form, their presence brings utility—yet utility is finite, and they incur blame from rise and fall.\nThis is why, speaking of the wheel, the absence of the hub yields the wheel’s use; speaking of vessels, the absence of the void yields their utility; speaking of rooms, the absence of the void yields their stability.»",

      "translated_text": "The Mysterious Dao Explained\n\nIf we speak of the profound, then the one that circulates my *qi* is the **Hé Chē** (River Wheel), the one that gathers my *zhēn* (true essence) is the **Dǐng Qì** (Crucible Vessel), and the one that houses my spirit is the **Jiàng Shì** (Vermilion Chamber). These three—how are they truly used? They are employed through *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five flavors dull the palate. The true essence does not fail to preserve itself within, and nature does not fail to return to its origin—yet the reason it cannot is that it is constantly seduced by external things.\n\nThe eyes fix upon sight, yet I would use wisdom to perceive its true color—yet I do not see, for the colors of things blind me. The ears fix upon sound, yet I would use steadfastness to hear its true voice—yet I do not hear, for the sounds of things deafen me. The mouth fixates upon taste, yet I would use utmost simplicity to know its true flavor—yet I do not know, for the flavors of things dull me.\n\nWhen the eyes reach blindness and close wisdom’s gaze, when the ears reach deafness and shatter steadfastness, when the mouth reaches dullness and cannot dwell in simplicity, the nine perversions arise, and the true essence is lost. Thus, the common man—how can he speak of the Dao?\n\nHunting and chasing game drive the mind to madness, and coveting rare treasures obstructs conduct. Therefore, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes, and thus discards the former to take the latter.\n\nThe seven emotions arise from indulgence, and the three poisons stem from greed. Moreover, nature manifests through the heart as its exterior, and the heart manifests nature as its interior. When nature is settled and the mind is clear, with no attachment to external things, then hunting and rare treasures—what harm can they truly bring?\n\nTo hunt and chase game is to agitate *qi* and blood, dispersing them outward, and thus the mind becomes maddened. To covet rare treasures is to steal and deceive, to scheme and take crookedly, and thus conduct becomes obstructed. These are the things the sage does not do, and yet he says, “Nourish the belly, not the eyes,” to clarify that he nourishes the inner self and not the outer.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\n\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shocks; great calamities are like the body itself.\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation? Honor is lowly—when one gains it, it is like a shock; when one loses it, it is like a shock. This is called honor and humiliation as sudden shocks.\n\nWhat is meant by great calamities being like the body? The reason I have great calamities is that I have a body. When the heart is loyal to the Dao yet ensnared by things, it rejoices in glory and is shocked by misfortune, always burdened by gain and loss, and cannot attain the boundless.\n\nMoreover, when a man dwells in honor and receives his stipend, gaining glory for himself, if he resides in it with ostentation and refuses to decline, if he acts arrogantly and transgresses law, if he is haughty and despises the lowly, if he is dazzling and shames the humble—then accumulating gold and horses, is this not the height of honor? What humiliation is there to speak of?\n\nYet when he loses even a little, he considers it a grievous loss.\n\nThe perfected man is not thus: honor does not bring him joy, disgrace does not bring him sorrow. Receiving a stipend of ten thousand *zhong* (bushels), feasting on a square *fang* (hundred feet) of food—I do not possess it. Eating coarse grains and drinking from a gourd, dwelling in a thatched hut and a clay chamber—I do not sorrow. Gaining it is clamorous, losing it is clamorous—how can it truly shock me?\n\nOnly those who possess honor know the greatest humiliation—what else could it be but shock?\n\nWhen I have no body, what calamity can I have?\n\nThus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure is as if one could entrust the world to the heavens.\n\nMan receives his fate from the formless and takes shape in the formed. Moreover, when form arises from the formed, it combines the borrowed essences of earth, water, wind, and fire, generating the substance of spirit, *qi*, blood, and essence. Dwelling and moving cannot escape the constraints of cold and heat, and action cannot evade the demands of labor. Thus, even in drinking water and eating grains to fill the inner self, and in wearing silk and cloth to defend the outer, there may be excess or deficiency—how can one avoid calamity?\n\nOnly when one steals the true essence of yin and yang, and seizes the proper order of creation, when anger and joy depart from the chest, when cold and heat flee to the external, when one discards the borrowed Four Great Elements and has no body, when one reverses the Nine Transformations and returns to the Dao—then I, with this non-being, do not generate, and in emptiness, there is no transformation. What calamity can there be?\n\nThe Classic says, *“When I have no body, what calamity can I have?”*—is this not so?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\n\nThat which is unseen when viewed is called *yí* (level/even),\nThat which is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (rare),\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (subtle).\n\nThe Dao dwells above the **Tàisù** (Great Purity) with no form, so the colors that color, even with the clarity of **Lílóu** (a mythical seer), have no place to apply their sight.\nThe Dao dwells within the **Tàixū** (Great Void) with no sound, so the sounds that sound, even with the acuity of **Shī Guāng** (a legendary musician), have no place to focus their hearing.\nThe Dao exists before the Nameless with no image, so the images that image, even with the strength of **Wū Gé** (a mythical giant), cannot lift its weight.\n\nThus, *yí* is why it is unseen when viewed,\n*xī* is why it is unheard when listened to,\n*wēi* is why it is ungraspable when touched—\nthis is when speaking of the constant.\n\nIf one opens the wise eye to perceive true color, then it can be seen when viewed;\nIf one awakens the subtle ear to hear rare sound, then it can be heard when listened to;\nIf one applies wondrous force to move great form, then it can be grasped when touched.\n\nThe reason the common man cannot is that the five colors blind the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five affairs obstruct the heart. These three cannot be forced or constrained, and thus they merge into one.\n\nThe Dao is nowhere and everywhere—it cannot be named by things, nor can it be represented by images. Yet when it fulfills its use for the world, then all things are without exception the Dao.\n\nMoreover, the Dao in things is one—it cannot be divided. Yet the sage speaks of *yí*, *xī*, and *wēi* as distinct, setting forth the tendencies of sight, hearing, and touch.",
      "overlap_context": "ao; what exists below form is called things.\nWhen the Dao is beyond form, non-action is its use—its use is boundless, and there is no depletion from new or old.\nWhen things are below form, their presence brings utility—yet utility is finite, and they incur blame from rise and fall.\nThis is why, speaking of the wheel, the absence of the hub yields the wheel’s use; speaking of vessels, the absence of the void yields their utility; speaking of rooms, the absence of the void yields their stability.»",

balance is unshakable,\nits emptiness unfathomable—\nthus, from self-tolerance, one reaches great public virtue.\n\nHaving attained public virtue,\none can govern all living things,\nenact laws for the world—\nthe myriad affairs, though complex, can be resolved by me,\nthe four seas, though vast, can be concealed within.\nThis is nurturing simplicity within while transforming customs.\n\nNow, muddled as the turbid—\nhow does this differ?\nWho can still the turbid with slow clarity?\nWho can settle the restless with slow vitality?\nClear water, if disturbed by things,\nbecomes turbid in its clarity;\nthe settled, if tempted by things,\nwill surely move in their stillness.\n\nTurbidity obscures clarity,\nyet cannot restore it through stillness—\nclarity is lost in turbidity.\nMovement disrupts stillness,\nyet cannot transform it through vitality—\nstillness is endangered by movement.\nThis is not the way of the virtuous gentleman.\n\nI am otherwise:\nstillness as constancy, slow clarity in turbidity—\nwhat harm is there in turbidity?\nMovement as change, slow vitality in stillness—\nwhat must be guarded in stillness?\n\nThus stillness does not lose nature,\nmovement does not lose the Dao,\nand there is no drowning in one extreme.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao\ndo not desire fullness.\nOnly because they do not desire fullness\ncan they avoid decay while remaining new.\n\nThings fail because of their completion,\naffairs decay because of their renewal—\nthus the cycles of success and failure,\nrenewal and decay,\nare fixed laws,\nyet human nature cannot escape them.\n\nBut the virtuous gentleman, guarding the Dao,\nallows decay to become renewal;\nhandling affairs,\nallows failure to become new success.\nAges pass without decay—\nconstant renewal;\na lifetime without failure—\nthus it is not achieved by other means,\nbut arises from not desiring fullness.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter on Attaining the Utmost Void**\nAttaining the utmost void,\nsteadfast in stillness,\nall things stir together.\nBorn yet not possessed,\nsometimes possessed—\nthis is the void not yet extreme.\nSettled yet unmoving,\nsometimes moving—\nthis is stillness not yet steadfast.\n\nThe Dao is above all things,\nresponding to myriad changes without depletion,\nguarding the true unity without exhaustion—\nencompassed by the vastness of the cosmos,\nno boundary is seen;\naided by the emergence of all living things,\nno movement is known.\nEmpty and reaching the void,\ndeep and ever serene—\nentering it in abundance does not fill it,\nexiting it in multitude does not disturb it.\nThus emptiness is attained to its extreme,\nstillness is guarded with steadfastness—\nand this is why all things stir together.\n\nAll things come,\nbeginning in formlessness,\nending in manifestation.\nIf the void is not extreme,\nthose born cannot avoid obstruction;\nif stillness is not steadfast,\nthose returning cannot avoid exhaustion—\nyet if I can return to it,\nthen human cultivation reaches its peak.\n\nHaving reached the peak of human cultivation—\nwhat then?\nIt is only to communicate with Heaven.\n\nWhen humans reach communion with Heaven,\nthis is the utmost.\nWhat need have they of things and persons to control them?",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is the Dao.\n\nThis *sutra* is why it contains the Lord—\nthe Lord becomes King,\nthe King becomes Heaven,\nand Heaven returns to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**\n\nThe Supreme Sage, below knows of his existence;\nThe next, is praised and honored;\nThe next, is feared and reviled.\n\nOf old, the Sage’s governance\nstored thought in profound silence,\nrevered himself in the boundless void,\ndid nothing yet awaited the world’s actions,\nspoke not yet responded to the world’s changes.\nWith spirit he stirred and moved—\nthen commands issued without known origin,\nwith body he taught and transformed—\nthen governance unfolded without known means.\nThus the people were transformed without coercion,\nruled without effort,\nresponded without prompting,\nfeared without punishment.\nThey daily drew upon his virtue,\nunaware of virtue’s embrace;\nthey daily followed his Dao,\nunaware of Dao’s path.\nThus they flowed vast and self-sufficient,\nradiant and self-satisfied—\nthis is the governance of the Supreme Sage,\nwhere nature itself is the transformation.\nHence it is said: *below knows of his existence.*\n\nWhen the Three Sovereigns came after,\ninstitutions were refined,\nrewards and punishments were established.\nThere was governance that loved people\nas a guardian cherishes an infant,\nand virtue that returned the people\nlike water flowing to its source.\nWith kindness they nurtured them,\nand the people loved them as parents;\nwith benevolence they relieved them,\nand the people praised them as Heaven and Earth.\nThis was the age of deliberate action,\nwhere governance ruled the people—\nthus the people honored and praised them.\n\nBut the next was otherwise.\nSome established harsh laws and severe punishments\nto wield terror from above,\nothers inverted the Dao and ruined virtue\nand lost governance below.\nOne feared their threats yet dared transgressions\nto escape shame,\nthe other scorned their governance\nand disrupted norms to commit wrongs.\nThus laws, though feared, bred defiance,\nvirtue, though scorned, could not prevent it.\nThe people fell short of praise and honor,\nand the Sage above was ashamed of those who merely knew of him.\nHow could one not choose wisely?\n\nIf trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\nThus, value your words.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe people say, *\"It was natural.\"*\nWithin, it aligns with oneself;\nwithout, it deceives not the world—\nthis is called trust.\nTrust is what the Sage uses\nto proclaim commands and intentions,\nreaching to the four quarters.\nIf lacking in this, how shall the people trust?\n\nThe Sage first contemplates, then speaks;\nfirst deliberates, then acts.\nHis words are not reckless,\nhis speech not deceitful.\nHis commands are like divination—\ntrustworthy and verifiable.\nHis orders are like echoes—\nresponsive and certain.\nThus trust is established.\n\nBut if trust is lacking,\nits root lies in undervaluing words.\nWords, when valued, are not lightly spoken;\nwords, when valued, are not cheaply given.\nNot lightly spoken, they carry weight—\nno words are spoken in haste.\nNot cheaply given, they are honored—\nno words are spoken in vain.\nOnly thus do deeds reach fulfillment,\naffairs reach completion,\nand the people act naturally.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**\n\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\nren and yi arise;\nWhen wisdom emerges,\ngreat deceit follows.\n\nThe Sage, when facing affairs, has no intent;\nwhen encountering things, has no mind.\nNo intent—then the labor of governance and restraint\ndoes not manifest externally.\nNo mind—then the scheming of calculation and perception\ndoes not arise within.\nThus all actions stem from the Dao,\nall speech and silence align with the Dao.\n\nYet when myriad threads arise,\na hundred forms emerge,\nlove and hatred take shape,\nand the authority of taking and withholding is established—\nthen the Great Dao splits into two,\nand ren and yi are put into practice.\n\nWhen knowledge grows excessive,\nthe Sage guards with simplicity.\nWhen schemes arise from foresight,\nthe Sage employs obscurity.\nKnowledge, if not restrained, will be deficient—\nthen wisdom becomes rigid.\nPerception, if not obscured, will be unclear—\nthen schemes become cunning.\nThus wisdom arises from the chest,\nand great deceit from the heart—\nand the Dao is distant from us.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discard the Sage, Abandon Wisdom**\n\nDiscard the Sage, abandon wisdom—\nthe people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\nTo know all is called the Sage,\nto know everything is called wisdom.\nThe Sage, then, fulfills nature to realize the self,\nembodies the Dao to govern things—\nyet specifically discards this,\ndaring not to claim sagacity,\nfor it is beyond what the common people can attain.\nWisdom, then, reveals the past to foresee the unseen,\ndiscerns the present to know the unchanging—\nyet specifically abandons this,\ndaring not to claim knowledge,\nfor it is beyond what the common people understand.\n\nIf one claims sagacity,\nthose who fall short feign it with deceit.\nIf one claims wisdom,\nthose who lack it abandon truth for falsehood.\nOnly by discarding and abandoning them\ndo the people return to their natural inclinations—\nand their benefit increases a hundredfold.\n\nDiscard ren, abandon yi—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nHeaven has five decrees,\nhumans have five constants—\nthen parent and child are Heaven’s natural order.\nAt the beginning of Heaven’s decree,\ninnate knowledge arises from nature,\ninnate ability stems from no deliberation—\nand the essence of filial piety and kindness\nnaturally resides between parent and child.\nWhat need is there for teaching to guide them?\n\nYet when parent and child grow estranged,\nit is because ren and yi obstruct them.\nRen is love for others,\nyet when applied where love is absent,\nyi is propriety for others,\nyet when applied where it is unsuited—\nthen things contend in love where love is lacking,\nand people uphold propriety where it is misplaced.\nFilial piety and kindness may thus be lost.\n\nIf ren and yi are discarded,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\n\nDiscard cleverness, abandon gain—\nthen thieves and robbers will cease.\nTo value cleverness is to exhaust it,\nto value gain is to contend for it—\nthe roots of thieves and robbers.\nEmbrace simplicity, hold to purity,\nreduce private desires, minimize cravings.\nThose who follow the current flow far\nwill inevitably dry up,\nthose who cling to branches multiply\nyet will inevitably falter.\nNow, if one

      "translated_text": "The Dao disperses from its pure transformation into the *wei* (維), while the loss of nature arises from harmony and suitability, manifesting as discord. When one exhales brilliance outward, substance is necessarily depleted within; when one shifts truth to external things, essence is inevitably consumed. Sometimes cunning arises from great falsehood, and deceit emerges from many paths—then my Dao is lost to them.\n\nBut I differ from this. I contain harmony while my thoughts do not yet sprout, guard the One while my purity does not scatter. I forget joy and anger to block my passions, assail love and aversion to dissolve their intent. Like the unmanifest before its form, like an infant before its first smile—who else could fully embody nature and the Dao?\n\nOnly by fully embodying nature does one always remain deficient,\nOnly by embodying the Dao does one always remain weak.\nTo be deficient for the sake of the world’s completeness,\nTo be weak for the sake of the world’s strength—\nThis is why I always differ from the common folk.\nThus, where they are bright and clear,\nI seem dim and obscured;\nwhere they are sharp and discerning,\nI am muddled and dull.\n\nMellow as the sea, yet unresting like a whirlwind.\nI dwell in emptiness and stillness to govern myself,\nI wait in depth and profundity to respond to things—\nThis is the embodiment of the Dao, hence my mellowness like the sea.\nI universally nourish the world,\nI am vast and scatter across all things—\nThis is the application of the Dao, hence my whirlwind without end.\n\nThe common folk all have their ways,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse.\nMy Dao is theirs is matter—\nMatter without the Dao does not arise,\nThe Dao without matter is eternal.\nI dwell in the Dao’s constancy—\nHow could matter affect me?\nThus I make matter serve my purpose,\nFor I am not enslaved by it.\n\nYet the common folk all have their ways,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse—\nIs it because I cannot enter or take?\nI alone differ from others,\nYet I value nourishing at the Mother’s breast.\nSpeaking of its beginning, it is like the unmanifest before its form;\nSpeaking of its eminence, it is like the Emperor before his emergence.\nThe heavens and earth are vast,\nWith the Dao as their origin;\nAll things are many,\nWith the Dao as their Mother.\nThe Mother has the way of giving birth and nourishing—\nI have long dwelled here, gazing—\nDo I not desire to be born?\nDo I not desire to be nourished?\nHaving been born and nourished,\nWhat else could I abandon the Dao for?\nThus, I value nourishing at the Mother’s breast.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Great Virtue Follows the Dao**\nThe manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao cannot be learned—\nIt is followed by nature and spontaneity,\nAnd those who follow nature naturally attain the Dao.\nWhen the Dao is attained by me,\nThen what I nourish is true,\nWhat I bestow is virtue,\nAnd virtue thus arises from the Dao,\nEmerging after me so that others may cultivate it.\n\nYet the Dao is without form,\nWhile virtue is with form.\nWhen virtue reaches its peak, it merges into the Dao;\nWhen the Dao is supreme, it disperses into virtue.\nThus, the interplay of Dao and virtue\nHas never been separable.\nThe Classic speaks of the manifestation of great virtue,\nFollowing only the Dao—\nIts principle is as such.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only vague and indistinct.\nIndistinct and vague, yet within it are forms;\nVague and indistinct, yet within it are things.\nProfound and dark, yet within it is essence—\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it is authenticity.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has never faded,\nTo observe all things.\n\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBecause of this:\nWhen the Dao reaches supreme stillness, it cannot be heard;\nWhen the Dao reaches supreme nothingness, it cannot be seen.\nTo move forward and meet it, there is no head to face;\nTo follow behind and track it, there is no tail to pursue—\nThis is the essence of the Great Dao,\nDwelling in its constancy.\n\nWhen it departs from its essence to manifest in application,\nIt cannot be said to be without form while lacking a name,\nCannot be said to be without substance while lacking appearance—\nThis is the \"having within the without,\"\nAnd thus forms emerge from the indistinct and vague.\n\nThis is its essence—\nCalled true nothingness;\nThis is its application—\nCalled true having.\nWhen there are forms, there are things;\nWhen there are shapes, there is nature.\nAfter forms and things arise,\nTo speak of essence is to speak of true having—\nTrue having is not the source of generation,\nBut it enters the realm of transformation,\nDwelling in the domain of yin and yang.\nWhen true nature is stirred, it transforms without transformation;\nWhen authentic *qi* circulates, it generates without generation—\nThis is generation,\nIts principle is profound.\nNot manifesting in visible forms,\nNot revealing in clear shapes—\nIt is truly true,\nTruly authentic,\nAnd always employs profundity and darkness in its function.\nOnly those who grasp the Dao,\nThe insight of the perfected,\nCan discuss this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Bending to Fulfil**\nBend to be whole,\nCrooked to be straight,\nHollow to be full,\nWorn to be renewed,\nFew to gain,\nMany to be confused.\nThe Dao disperses across the world—\nThose who grasp it subtly attain refinement,\nThose who grasp it sparsely attain coarseness.\nThus, the world’s people and things cannot help but differ in their distance, duration, elevation, and depth.\n\nThe Sage possesses the Dao in its completeness,\nReceives nature in its entirety,\nAnd in responding to the world’s diversity,\nAchieves the boundless within oneself—\nAll without relying on external means,\nBut following its inherent principle.\n\nMoreover, the world’s natures cannot all be straight—\nIf I insist on my straightness to correct others’ crookedness,\nMy straightness cannot avoid harm.\nThe world’s things cannot all be beautiful—\nIf I rely on my fullness without accommodating others,\nMy fullness cannot avoid loss.\nThings replace one another,\nNecessarily reaching a point of wear—\nIf I embrace renewal, then wear will come at its time;\nMatters intermingle,\nNecessarily bringing confusion—\nIf I survey broadly, then confusion will arise at its time.\n\nThe Sage knows this,\nFollowing the principles of things—\nThus, bending makes straight,\nLowering makes full,\nRenewing virtue daily while always embracing wear,\nGuarding with restraint to avoid confusion—\nOnly then, internally dwelling in the Dao,\nIs the Dao never incomplete;\nExternally governing affairs,\nIs governance never disordered.\nWith my subtlety awaiting the world’s multitude,\nWith my proximity drawing the far reaches of the four seas.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**The Way of Self-Effacement and Virtue**\n\nIf not by emptiness in dwelling upon oneself,\nAnd by expansiveness in treating others,\nThen how could one achieve such harmony?\n\nThus, the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under heaven.\n*Oneness* is the beginning of the Dao,\nThe origin of heaven and earth.\nBefore yin and yang were distinct,\nMy true essence was without falsehood,\nAnd when all things had not yet emerged,\nMy nature was without division.\n\nOthers and I cannot both be served by duality,\nHumans and things cannot be separated by mutual distinctions—\nThis is the transformation of the utmost purity,\nThe complete Dao of pristine essence.\nExtending this to all under heaven,\nHow could it not be the ultimate law?\n\nNot self-assertive, thus clear;\nNot self-righteous, thus victorious;\nNot self-conceited, thus enduring.\n\nOnly by not contending,\nThe world cannot contend with me.\nThe ancients spoke of *\"bending to preserve fullness\"*—\nWas this not a truth spoken sincerely?\nIt is indeed fullness that returns to its source.\n\nThe world’s clarity shines in seeing others,\nYet fails to see itself—\nNo greater clarity exists,\nFor without true clarity, one cannot see oneself,\nNor dare one claim to see others.\n\nThe world’s wisdom knows of others,\nYet fails to know itself—\nNo greater wisdom exists,\nFor without true wisdom, one cannot affirm itself,\nNor dare one affirm others.\n\nThus, when virtue extends to all under heaven,\nIts blessings are never excluded—\nWhen it transcends all people,\nNone can surpass its vastness.\nIf not the Sage,\nHow could its clarity not be self-assertive,\nUnable to bend and preserve fullness?\nHow could its wisdom not be self-righteous,\nUnable to yield and attain straightness?\n\nTo boast of one’s achievements until fullness overflows,\nReaching the point of false pretension—\nThen what of humility?\nTo vaunt one’s abilities until brilliance fades,\nReaching the point of self-exhaustion—\nThen what of renewal?\n\nSuch is the way of the common multitude,\nBut the Sage reverses this—\nHence, again he says:\n*\"Only by not contending,\nThe world cannot contend with me.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Rare and Natural**\n\nThe rare and natural—\nThat which has form can be deduced by principle,\nThat which has speech can be guided by things.\nSome matters arise from human action,\nOthers emerge from the unfolding of time—\nThese are not the true rare and natural.\n\nOnly that which cannot be forced yet comes to be,\nWhich cannot be summoned yet arrives,\nWhich is perceived by the spirit and then seen,\nWhich is heard by the *qi* and then understood—\nIf one receives without exclusion,\nThen transformation comes without prompting;\nIf one gives rise to what already exists,\nThen change emerges from what is present—\nThen what is there to do?\n\nIt is simply being in accord with nature.\nThis is why none can force it yet it is done,\nNone can transform it yet it is transformed—\nIf not the rare and natural, what else could it be?\n\nYet the unrefined cannot achieve this,\nAnd yet it is called rare—\nBecause to raise one corner is not to reflect the other three.\n\nA gusting wind does not last all morning,\nA sudden rain does not last all day.\nOf all that heaven uses to stir life,\nNothing is greater than the wind,\nAnd of all that nourishes things,\nNothing is greater than the rain.\nWind and rain are heaven’s resources,\nThe reliance of all things—\nYet they arise only when yin and yang meet in harmony.\n\nThe true essence of yin and yang\nIs upright yet without contradiction,\nHarmonious yet without discord—\nThus they arrive without fail,\nTheir coming is measured,\nTheir course is constant.\nThen where is the difference between gusting and sudden?\n\nOnly when they exceed their bounds,\nDo they become gusting wind or sudden rain—\nThis is the irregularity of yin and yang,\nAnd why they do not last all morning or all day.\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao:\nThe Daoist aligns with the Dao,\nThe virtuous align with virtue,\nThe lost align with loss.\nTo align with the Dao, the Dao is attained;\nTo align with virtue, virtue is attained—\nTo align with loss, loss is attained.\n\nTo dwell in the realm of the formless,\nTo be still in the midst of nothingness—\nNot to seek the Dao through names and instruments,\nNot to grasp it through forms and images—\nYet to remain ever in the profound transformations of the *mystic-mystic*,\nIn the depths of the *obscure-obscure*—\nWithout seeking the Dao, the Dao is found,\nWithout seeking virtue, virtue is found.\n\nOnly when one departs from the formless to cling to the formed,\nWhen one abandons Oneness to pursue duality,\nWhen one seeks the Dao’s name to claim attainment,\nWhen one seeks virtue’s splendor to claim attainment—\nThen, if attained, it is truly loss.\n\nTo seek the Dao without aligning with virtue,\nTo have virtue without knowing loss—\nThis is to dwell in the true boundary of the formless,\nIn the wondrous realm of the *mystic-mystic*—\nAnd to act without ever departing from the rare.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Stilted Cannot Stand**\n\nThe stilted cannot stand,\nThe straddling cannot walk.\nHumans must have nature,\nThings must have boundaries—\nIf nature is imbalanced,\nThe Dao cannot be fully preserved;\nIf boundaries are exceeded,\nThe Dao cannot be sought in its fullness.\n\nThus, the Dao arises from nature,\nNature enters through the Dao—\nTo return the body to the nameless,\nTo embody transformation in the natural,\nOne must first await the purity and stillness of nature.\n\nIf one desires to stand yet remains stilted,\nIf one desires to walk yet straddles—\nTo reverse and stand stilted,\nTo reverse and walk straddling,\nOne must know that it cannot be done.\n\nAn incomplete form struggles even in standing and walking,\nHow much more so an imbalanced nature\nThat could ever establish the Dao?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undifferentiated Origin**\n\nThere is an undifferentiated origin,\nBorn before heaven and earth—\nSilent and vast,\nIt stands alone yet never changes,\nIt moves in cycles yet never falters—\nShimmering above yet vast without form,\nObscure within yet indistinct without image—\nYin and yang concealed in a single hue,\nCreation and transformation hidden in the unfathomable—\nThen clarity and turbidity are not yet divided,\nHeaven and earth are not yet distinct—\nAnd yet, how could one call it *undifferentiated*?\n\nWhen heaven and earth are born\nAnd all things emerge,\nThen my Dao disperses and becomes distinct throughout the world,\nTo fulfill its function.\n\nNow, to speak of the undifferentiated origin—\nIt is the ancient Master’s desire to gather the world’s scattered fragments\nAnd return them to Oneness,\nTo complete the ten thousand things without end,\nTo move in cycles without depletion,\nAnd to ensure the ages without flaw—\nHence he says:\n*\"It stands alone yet never changes,\nIt moves in cycles yet never falters.\"*\n\nTo stand alone yet never change,\nThis is how the Dao undifferentiated remains above to return to its source—\nTo move in cycles yet never falter,\nThis is how the Dao undifferentiated flows below to embrace transformation—\nThen the principle of the undifferentiated origin\nIs revealed in these two aspects.",

them.\n\nHumans follow the earth, the earth follows the heavens,\nthe heavens follow the Dao, and the Dao follows *Ziran* [自然].\nThe heavens and earth possess the utmost sovereign,\nyet the Dao surpasses them all;\nall things have their formed principles,\nyet the Dao is their deepest mystery—\nthus, the Dao, encompassing the universe to its utmost extremes,\ndwelling above the Three Realms [三才],\nis great beyond measure.\n\nFrom singularity to duality, the Two Polarities [两仪] take their positions:\nthe one above, exalted and boundless in its far-reaching,\nthe one below, profound and vast without end—\nwho could surpass their nurturing and encompassing function?\nIts greatness thus attains the Dao’s singularity.\n\nWith the Two Polarities established, the Sage stands in the middle,\npossessing utmost sovereignty to govern all things,\nand utmost fairness to uphold the Great Dao,\nfulfilling the ranks of humanity,\nand embodying the ruler’s Way—\nhow could this be considered small?\n\nThis is why the ruler is also great.\n\nTo elaborate and clarify,\nthe greatness of the Dao is the heavens,\nthe greatness of the heavens is the earth,\nthe greatness of the earth is the ruler—\nthus, it follows below with: *\"Humans follow the earth,\nthe earth follows the heavens,\nthe heavens follow the Dao.\"*\nYet the Dao itself follows none—\nit arises from *Ziran* alone,\nhence: *\"The Dao follows Ziran.\"*\n\n**Chapter XXVI: On Weight as the Root of Lightness**\nWeight is the root of lightness,\nstillness is the sovereign of agitation.\nThus, the virtuous person walks all day without straying from his baggage.\nThough surrounded by splendor and spectacle,\nhe rests in detached serenity.\nHow could one of the ten thousand chariots\nconsider his own body as weightier than the world?\n\nThe principles of heaven and earth,\nthe sentiments of all things—\nwhen steadfast, they are weighty;\nweighty, they return to their source.\nWhen tranquil, they are still;\nstill, they restore their true nature.\n\nYet when entangled in the world’s myriad principles,\nvariation arises from it;\nwhen embroiled in all things’ diverse sentiments,\nstratagems emerge from it.\nVariation arises, and myriad forms come together,\nwhile weighty things are burdened by lightness;\nstratagems emerge, and falsehoods intermingle,\nwhile still things are disturbed by agitation.\nThe affliction of frivolity and superficiality sometimes manifests,\nand omens of good and ill, regret and blame,\nreach everywhere.\n\nIn the past, weight was lost to its source,\nand stillness in its time was disrupted by agitation—\nthus, it was not good.\n\nThe virtuous person knows that weight is the root of lightness,\nso he walks without straying from his baggage;\nknows that stillness is the sovereign of agitation,\nso though surrounded by splendor and spectacle,\nhe rests in detached serenity.\nThus, the virtuous person’s understanding of weight, lightness, agitation, and stillness\nalso returns to the source and restores true nature.\n\nLightness leads to losing one’s subjects,\nagitation leads to losing one’s sovereignty.\nA ruler, though noble as the Son of Heaven,\npossessing wealth of the four seas,\nhis power is the utmost sovereign,\nhis station the utmost height—\nhis weight is indeed unexcelled.\nIf he opposes the world with his own body,\nif he regards the world as the multitude,\nand his own body as weighty,\nthen with the sovereignty of the ten thousand chariots,\nhis own body should be considered light.\nYet this is not good.\n\n**Chapter XXVII: On Benevolent Action**\nBenevolent action leaves no tracks or traces,\nyet with chariots he traverses all lands,\nand on foot he ascends every path—\nhis actions, though vast, are thus benevolent.\n\nThe Sage embodies the spirit in the most profound depths,\nconceals the marvelous in the unfathomable.\nIn stillness, he dwells with the Dao,\nin motion, he emerges with the Dao—\nwhen he acts, how could there be tracks or traces to observe?\nIt is simply without.\n\nTracks imply stagnation in movement,\ntraces imply obstruction in passage.\nThe Sage’s actions are without stagnation yet ever in motion,\nwithout obstruction yet ever in passage—\nthough enduring to the ten thousand ages,\nwhat flaw could there be?\nThis is because he is wholly dedicated to the Dao.\n\nBenevolent speech is without blemish or censure,\nThe Sage dwells in the Dao within himself,\nand employs the Dao to benefit all things.\nWhen dwelling within himself,\nhe is silent and exchanges with the spirit,\ndark and unites with the mind—\nradiant within the marvelous transformation,\nquiet within the mysterious creation—\nwhy would speech be preferred over this?\n\nYet when he emerges to benefit all things,\nengaging in deeds and stirring the heart’s voice,\nhe proclaims a single word to make the world his law,\nand spreads a single teaching to set the ten thousand ages as his standard.\nHe dispels the dullness of the common people,\nand awakens the deafness of the world—\nthus, his speech arises from necessity.\n\nYet even his speech,\ndoes not multiply to excess nor deplete by scarcity—\nwhen much, it exhausts all principles,\nfilling the world yet never wrong;\nwhen little, it adheres to the law,\nnot reaching even a single scroll yet still right—\nthis is benevolent speech,\nhow could it not be without blemish or censure?\n\nTo invert this with unbenevolent speech,\nemerging to invite blame,\nmoving to regret,\nrecklessly creating flaws,\nand cleverly harming virtue—\nit is not merely without blemish or censure,\nbut also brings harm.\n\n**On Benevolent Planning Without Calculation**\nExhausting the realm’s transformations,\nits variations are endless;\ncomprehending the world’s numbers,\nits reckoning is boundless.\nExhausting one’s intelligence leads to fatigue,\nexpending one’s strength leads to depletion—\nthough one may wish to calculate,\nit cannot be measured.»",

no harm?\nThus, it is rightly called an ill-omened tool—\nand the Daoist does not dwell upon it.\n\nThe Daoist, embracing *Oneness* above,\nsettles the people within.\nTo guard *Oneness* with *wuwei* is to follow nature—\nthus, at ease and wandering,\never aligned with the Way.\nTo govern the people through institutions is to manifest law—\nthus, adapting and transforming,\never approaching the Way.\n\nThough war is ill-omened,\nthe Daoist does not delight in it.\nIf forced to use it,\nlet restraint be supreme.\nWhy flaunt our might to cow their courage,\nor march our armies to suppress their chaos?\nDo not revel in killing,\nbut let victory serve the Way.\nDraw all benefits to the True Source,\nand with three reversals, plan for triumph—\nthis is not to boast of beauty.\nIf one

it?\n\nIf kings and lords guard this *Pu*,\nall things will come as guests.\nWithin the central realm, four great forces exist—\nthe Way and the King each occupy one.\nIf the King wields this *Pu* to govern all things,\nthen under Heaven, far and wide,\nthe good will come without urging,\nthe wicked will depart without punishment—\nuntil even those with eyes strain to see,\nand those with feet rise to hasten.\nThose transformed by its influence have no outer limit,\nthose who receive its virtue have a place to return.\nSmall and great gather in clouds,\nnear and far follow as shadows—\nis this not to be served as guests?\n\nIn speaking of the Way, none can subdue it—\nthis is called the most exalted.\nIn speaking of all things, they come as guests—\nthis is called the most honored.\nMost exalted, most honored—\nthe Way cannot be sought in forms and tools,\nthus it is called *Pu*.\n\nSeek it, and you find it;\nabandon it, and you lose it.\nIt comes when sought,\ndeparts when abandoned—\nhow could it not be small?\nThis small is not merely small—\nit is small yet vast,\nthus none can subdue it,\nand all things come as guests.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet it is evenly bestowed.\n\nThe Great Way is hidden in yin and yang,\nyin and yang are hidden in the Great Way.\nHeaven and Earth are the Way’s yin and yang,\nthus

life.\nThus, Heaven and Earth have the principle of generation.\n\nThat which gives life must also complete it—\nthus, sweet dew’s transformation is through *qi*,\n*qi*’s transformation is through form—\nand nothing fails to be born.\nWithout the harmony of yin and yang to fulfill its purpose,\nnone can speak of it.\n\nWhen naming first arose,\nnames already existed.\nKnow when to

thus is called \"not losing virtue/power.\"\nBut those who cling do not embody the Dao and virtue/power—\nThus, they lack virtue/power.\n\nThe Virtue/Power of Heaven is beyond attainment,\nSo it acts without contrivance and achieves nothing.\nThe virtue/power of grasping clings to its attainment,\nSo it acts with contrivance and achieves something.\n\nWhen virtue/power descends to benevolence,\nBenevolence can be wielded—\nThus, the Supreme Virtue/Power acts without contrivance,\nWhile Supreme Benevolence acts with contrivance.\nYet great benevolence is not benevolence—\nThough it acts, it achieves nothing,\nAnd nearly approaches the Supreme Virtue/Power.\n\nRighteousness encompasses virtue/power,\nYet righteousness can be diminished—\nThus, the lesser virtue/power acts with contrivance,\nAnd even Supreme Righteousness does so.\nYet inwardly, it establishes the self without forgetting it,\nOutwardly, it governs affairs without abandoning them—\nThough called Supreme Righteousness, it still clings,\nThus achieving something and resembling the lesser virtue/power.\n\nWhen the Dao declines and virtue/power wanes,\nTransformation and righteousness are both lost—\nUsing rites to interact with others,\nThis is the exchange of sincerity for pretense,\nAnd thus, action breeds calamity.\nWhen none respond, they bare their arms and force compliance—\nFrom

righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, rites arise.\n\nWhen Supreme Rites act and none respond,\nThis is the thinning of loyalty and trust.\nBaring arms and forcing compliance—\nThis is

is called the adornment of the Dao.\nWearying the mind and laboring the spirit,\nLosing one’s true nature—\nThus, it is called the start of folly.\n\nSince it is not said that rites follow wisdom,\nIt is because those who rely on rites disrupt virtue/power,\nAnd those who rely on wisdom invert the Dao.\n\nThus, the noble one dwells in the thick of virtue/power,\nNot in the thinness of rites,\nIn the substance of the Dao,\nNot in the adornment of wisdom—\nTherefore, he discards the adornments of human conduct\nAnd takes the substance of the Dao of Transformation.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The

attained Oneness and became responsive,\nThe valleys attained Oneness and became full,\nAll things attained Oneness and flourished,\nAnd the sovereigns attained Oneness to govern the world aright.\n\nTheir attainment of Oneness was such:\nIf Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear cracking,\nIf Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear erupting,\nIf the spirit lacked responsiveness, it would fear fading,\nIf the valleys lacked fullness, they would fear drying up,\nIf all things lacked flourishing, they would fear extinction,\nIf the sovereigns lacked right governance, their noble status would fear collapse.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as its foundation,\nAnd the high relies on the lowly as its base.\nTherefore, sovereigns call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" and \"not-grain\"—\nIs this not relying on the lowly as foundation?\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, the carriage of ten thousand horses is not adorned,\nNot polished like jade, nor rugged like stone.\nOneness is the Dao.\n\nBefore form, there was nothing attained—\nWhen the undifferentiated became distinct,\nIt originated from ancient times,\nAnd thus things obtained it.\n\nHeaven, firm and vast above,\nUses non-action as its function,\nThus attaining the Dao and becoming clear.\nEarth, settled and vast below,\nUses stillness as its essence,\nThus attaining the Dao and becoming tranquil.\nThe spirit, hidden and profound in the depths,\nUnfathomable in yin and yang,\nThus attaining the Dao and becoming responsive.\nThe valleys, hollow and sunken,\nFollow the Dao of Heaven—\nSince Heaven attains the Dao and becomes clear,\nThe valleys attain the Dao and become full.\nThings, still and nurtured,\nFollow the Dao of Earth—\nSince Earth attains the Dao and becomes tranquil,\nThings attain the Dao and flourish.\nThe spirit dwells in the body,\nThe sovereign of all limbs—\nThe spirit, the sovereign of all saints,\nThe sovereign of the world—\nSince the spirit attains the Dao and becomes responsive,\nThe sovereign attains the Dao to govern the world aright.\n\nThis attainment is none other than the Dao.\n\nIf Heaven loses its clarity,\nIt would have nothing to cover—\nAnd would fear cracking.\nIf Earth loses its tranquility,\nIt would have nothing to bear—\nAnd would fear erupting.\nIf the spirit loses its responsiveness,\nIt would have nothing to guard—\nAnd would fear fading.\nIf the valleys lose their fullness,\nThey would fear drying up.\nIf all things lose their flourishing,\nThey would fear extinction.\nIf the sovereigns lose their right governance,\nTheir noble status would fear collapse.\n\nThus, the lowly returns to them, displaying their nobility,\nThe lowly adheres to them, displaying their height—\nJust as mountains accumulate the low to become high,\nAnd seas gather waters to become vast,\nGreat persons unite to become sovereigns—\nThus, the noble and high cannot abandon their fundamental base.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign attains Oneness within his domain,\nAnd thus calls himself \"lonely\" and \"widowed,\"\nFeeding on the qi of Great Harmony,\nAnd thus calls himself \"not-grain.\"\nWith a hundred limbs,\nOnly then is the body’s

      "translated_text": "The noble is honored only when the people exist—\nThus, the sovereigns attain their exalted titles through this,\nIs it not because they take the lowly as their foundation?\n\nNow, the making of a carriage is but an analogy drawn near.\nIf one were to assemble the yoke, axles, wheels, and spokes before you,\nAnd count their many parts,\nYet constrain their use,\nThey would still not suffice to form a carriage.\nOnly when the yoke, axles, wheels, and spokes are united\nDoes the carriage earn its name of conveyance;\nOnly when the people, low and humble, are gathered\nDo the sovereigns attain their titles of nobility and height.\n\nJade is noble, stone is lowly—\nJade, emerging from stone, becomes noble,\nFor it takes the lowly as its foundation.\nYet jade has inherent substance and thus is noble by itself,\nWhile the sovereign, though possessing Oneness,\nDoes not inherently become noble—\nCould he truly wish to be like jade and stone?\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Motion of the Dao in Reversal**\nThe motion of the Dao lies in reversal,\nIts use lies in weakness.\nAll things under heaven are born of *having*,\nAnd *having* is born of *non-having*.\n\nStillness is the way of Earth.\nTo reverse Earth’s stillness into motion\nIs the response of yin to yang—\nThus, it is said: *The motion of the Dao lies in reversal.*\n\nWeakness is the way of Heaven.\nTo employ Heaven’s weakness as use\nIs the response of yang to yin—\nThus, it is said: *The use of the Dao lies in weakness.*\n\nYang employs *non-having* as its use,\nYin employs *having* as its substance.\nWhen yin and yang interact within the boundless void,\nThen things are born.\n\nAll things under heaven are born of Earth’s way,\nThus, it is said: *All things are born of having*—\nThis is the motion of the Dao in reversal?\nYet what is formed cannot suffice for life without Heaven’s way,\nThus, it is said: *Having is born of non-having*—\nThis is the use of the Dao in weakness.\n\nTherefore, the Sage speaks:\n*Having* takes *non-having* as its mother,\n*Non-having* takes *emptiness* as its mother,\n*Emptiness* takes the Dao as its mother.\nNaturalness is the root of the Dao.\nIf one can preserve and guard the Mysterious Pivot,\nAnd follow its naturalness,\nThen, from motion returning to stillness,\nAnd gathering use back into substance,\nOne will return to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**\nThe superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it;\nThe mediocre person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly, as if it might vanish;\nThe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThus, the *Building of Speech* says:\nThe Dao is bright yet seems obscure,\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreat,\nThe Dao’s path is smooth yet seems rugged,\nVirtue’s height is like a valley,\nGreat whiteness seems like shame,\nBroad virtue seems insufficient,\nEstablished virtue seems lazy,\nAuthentic truth seems false,\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel takes longest to shape,\nThe greatest sound is faint,\nThe greatest form is shapeless,\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao is good at lending itself to completion.\nThe superior person, having already understood the Dao,\nThus holds it with sincerity and guards it firmly—\nWhen they hear it, they must act upon it with vigor.\nThe mediocre person, striving to advance in the Dao,\nMakes effort and only then succeeds—\nWithout effort, they fail.\nThey ponder and only then attain it—\nWithout pondering, they do not.\nOne moment they advance, the next they retreat—\nEven when they hear it, doubt lingers in their hearts,\nThus, between existence and nonexistence,\nThey do not yet act upon it.\nThe inferior person takes the Dao’s path as level,\nLike one with coarse ears who does not hear great sounds,\nLike one with a common mind who rejects lofty speech—\nWhen they hear the Dao, they scorn it with derision,\nThus, they oppose the Dao utterly and laugh at it.\nIf the Dao were not laughed at by the inferior,\nHow different would it be from what coarse ears hear,\nFrom what the multitude speaks?\nHow could it suffice to be called the Dao?\n\nThus, the *Building of Speech* says:\nThe Dao is bright yet seems obscure—\nIf one stores it diligently in thought,\nFixes it in stillness, and reflects in silence,\nAnd strives in its practice,\nThen one attains it.\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreat—\nIf one calculates it daily and finds it insufficient,\nYet calculates it yearly and finds it in excess,\nAnd in existence and nonexistence bears no burden,\nThen it is acceptable.\nThe Dao’s path is smooth yet seems rugged—\nIf one clings to the attainable forms, colors, names, and sounds,\nAnd the pleasures of ear, eye, nose, and mouth,\nThen when people laugh at the Dao, one has erred.\nYet do they not know that the Four Great Elements exist within the domain,\nYet are not external to the Dao?\n\nThe highest virtue is the way of Heaven.\nHeaven’s way is hollow yet full—\nBecause it is hollow, it is like a valley.\nGreat whiteness is the way of the King.\nThe King’s way is worn yet renewed—\nBecause it is worn, it is like shame.\nBroad virtue, spoken of in terms of Earth’s way,\nIs used without depletion,\nYet its completion seems lacking—\nThus, it seems insufficient.\nEstablished virtue, spoken of in terms of the Great Dao,\nIs built without being uprooted,\nYet its cultivation is unnoticed—\nThus, it seems lazy.\nBecause it is like a valley, like shame, like insufficiency, like laziness,\nOne might doubt its changing nature.\nYet its essence as highest virtue, as great whiteness, as broad virtue, as established virtue\nRemains eternally true—\nThis is called *authentic truth seeming false.*\n\nWhy is authentic truth said to seem false?\nBecause the greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel takes longest to shape,\nThe greatest sound is faint,\nThe greatest form is shapeless.\nThe greatest square carries all things,\nIts virtue harmonizes without force—\nThus, it has no corners.\nThe greatest vessel is used for its purpose,\nEnduring in its way—\nThus, it takes long to complete.\nThe greatest sound is unsounded,\nYet the four seasons move through it—\nThus, its voice is faint.\nThe greatest form is not a thing,\nYet all under heaven turn toward it—\nThus, it is shapeless.\nThese are the reasons the Four Great are great.\n\nVirtue encompasses the Dao,\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven,\nThe Emperor’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth’s ways,\nAnd is nameless—\nFor it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao is present yet hidden,\nAs if dividing the Four Great within the domain,\nAll are but its manifesting and forcing of names.\nThe Dao itself is not good at lending itself to completion,\nYet because Heaven, Earth, and the Emperor embody this Dao to complete the world,\nThe name of *good at lending itself to completion* is thus established,\nAnd the effect of its curved fulfillment is thus marked.\nYet its completion is merely so—\nCould there be intent in urging it to completion?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Gives Birth to Oneness**\nThe Dao gives birth to Oneness,\nOneness gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nThe Three gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang,\nAnd through their harmonizing *qi* achieve balance.",

titles.\nThus, things may be diminished to gain, or gained to diminish.\nWhat men are taught, I too teach with righteousness.\nThe strong and violent shall not meet their proper end.\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nThe *Easy* (易) transforms and becomes Oneness,\nFor this is how Oneness arises—\nThus it is said: *The Dao gives birth to Oneness.*\nOneness is the beginning of form’s transformation,\nThe greatest form of Heaven and Earth—\nThus it is said: *Oneness gives birth to the Two.*\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions,\nMan dwells between them, and the Three Powers are complete—\nThus it is said: *The Two give birth to the Three.*\nThe light and pure ascend to become Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid descend to become Earth,\nThe harmonizing *qi* becomes Man—\nThen Heaven and Earth contain their essence,\nAnd all things transform and are born—\nThus it is said: *The Three give birth to all things.*\nHeaven is yang, austere and solemn;\nWhat issues from Heaven, yin ascends to meet yang,\nAnd things bear it upon their backs.\nEarth is yin, resplendent and vast;\nWhat issues from Earth, yang descends to meet yin,\nAnd things embrace it within.\nAs yin and yang rise and fall,\nTheir interplay gives birth to the harmonizing *qi*—\nThus it is said: *All things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang,*\n*And through their harmonizing qi achieve balance.*\n\nA man’s body mirrors Heaven and Earth:\nWithin him, yin and yang and harmonizing *qi* are all present.\nThere must be a most divine principle governing him,\nJust as kings and lords govern the world.\nTo be solitary within this domain is *nao* (孤);\nTo feed upon the *Taihe* (太和) *qi* is *bu gu* (不谷).\nMen of the world turn from the divine, calling these evils,\nYet the kings and lords embrace them as their titles—\nThus it is said: *What men detest—nao, gua, and bu gu—the kings and lords take as their titles.*\n\nThe harmonizing *qi* of yin and yang permeates all things,\nYet by itself, it neither diminishes nor benefits.\nIt is through Heaven and Earth’s filling and emptying,\nTheir waxing and waning with time,\nThat things may be diminished to gain, or gained to diminish.\nWhat men are taught must align with Heaven and Earth’s rectitude.\nIf I cherish stillness, the people will naturally align—\nThis is my righteous teaching.\nThis is called *diminishing to gain*.\nThe strong and violent invert this—\nThus they do not meet their proper end.\nThis is called *gaining to diminish*.\nThe sage observes this and takes it as a warning,\nThus I shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Supreme Softness of the World**\nThe world’s supreme softness overcomes the world’s supreme hardness.\nNothing can penetrate the seamless—\nThus one knows the benefit of *wuwei* (无为).\nSilent teaching and the benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world attain them.\n\nSupreme softness is *shen* (神);\nSupreme hardness is *xing* (形).\nTrue *shen* communicates with the Dao,\nCapable of annihilation and existence—\nOnly by letting *shen* govern *xing* can *shen* make *xing* soar,\nAnd *xing* follow to roam at will—\nThus it is said: *The world’s supreme softness overcomes the world’s supreme hardness.*\nSupreme softness is without form,\nSupreme hardness is seamless—\nIf *xing* governs *xing*, there are gaps;\nThus the seamless cannot be penetrated.\nIf *shen* governs *xing*, *shen* has passage—\nNothing enters without finding its place—\nThus it is said: *Nothing can penetrate the seamless.*\n\nWhat *xing* transforms is silent teaching.\nWhat *shen* attains is the benefit of *wuwei*.\nIf one embodies the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nDwells in *wuwei*, and practices silent teaching,\nThen one shapes *xing* and harmonizes with *shen*—\n*Xing* and *shen* both reach perfection,\nAnd align with the true Dao.\n\nThe world values spoken teaching and active doing,\nThus few attain this.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Names and the Body**\nBetween names and the body, which is more intimate?\nBetween the body and wealth, which is more abundant?\nBetween gain and loss, which brings greater harm?\nThus, excessive love leads to great expenditure,\nAnd hoarding leads to great loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one may endure forever.\n\nThe noble man labors night and day in anxious deliberation,\nYet his body grows frail—\nThus he perishes for the sake of his name.\nWho sees what is truly intimate—the body or the name?\n\nThe wealthy man toils endlessly, amassing wealth he cannot fully use,\nYet his body grows estranged—\nThus he perishes for the sake of profit.\nWho sees what is truly abundant—the body or wealth?\n\nYet when honor and disgrace are established, one sees what truly harms;\nWhen wealth accumulates, one sees what is truly contested.\nThose who value display as right know that names bring honor,\nThose who value riches as right know that wealth brings profit—\nThus they see gain and forget the body,\nSee profit and forget the true self.\n\nThen, between gain and loss, which truly brings greater harm?\nWhat they lose is the nameless *pu* (朴),\nThe body unburdened by wealth—\nWhat greater harm could there be?\n\nThus, to love names excessively without restraint\nWill exhaust the greatest things—\nThe greatest things are the Dao’s designation,\nThe nameless *pu* itself.\nTo hoard wealth without knowing sufficiency\nWill deplete the deepest virtues—\nThe deepest virtues are the essence of *de* (德),\nThe body unburdened by wealth.\n\nOnly the sage embodies broad virtue in knowing sufficiency,\nYet does not prize his wealth—\nThus he does not bring disgrace upon himself.\nHe embodies supreme virtue in knowing restraint,\nYet does not exalt his name—\nThus he does not court peril.\n\nSuch a one may endure forever,\nAnd stand equal with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**\nGreat fullness seems as if deficient—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nGreat abundance seems as if empty—\nIts use is boundless.\nGreat truth seems as if bent,\nGreat skill seems as if clumsy,\nGreat eloquence seems as if inarticulate.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat—\nCalmness and purity are the world’s rectitude.\n\nGreat fullness is Earth’s virtue—\nBroad virtue seems insufficient,\nThus though complete, it seems deficient.\nGreat abundance is Heaven’s virtue—\nSupreme virtue does not indulge itself,\nThus though full, it seems empty.\n\nIf completion is like a mountain, it will inevitably crumble—\nThis is not great fullness.\nGreat fullness, though deficient, never crumbles—\nThus its use is inexhaustible.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony with the Way**\nWhen fullness is like accumulated water,\nIts application will inevitably be exhausted—\nThis is not great abundance.\nGreat abundance seems as if empty,\nYet never exhausted—\nThus its use is boundless.\n\nThese two principles are the functions of Heaven and Earth—\nYin and Yang, they are.\nHeaven can generate without ceasing,\nYet its generative use is boundless.\nEarth can transform without ceasing,\nYet its transformative use is inexhaustible—\nThis is because the Way acts truly within them.\n\nOnly the unified is called the Three,\nThus, when Heaven and Earth are considered,\nThe Way becomes known.\nIf divided, then:\nGreat straightness seems bent—\nThis is the Way of Earth.\nEarth’s Way is straight yet restrained,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nGreat skill seems clumsy—\nThis is the Constant Way.\nThe Constant Way carves myriad forms yet does not indulge in cleverness,\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\nHeaven’s Way does not speak yet responds perfectly,\nThus it seems mute.\n\nYet considering their essence,\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nThey do not depart from Yin and Yang,\nAnd one Yin, one Yang—\nThis is the Way.\nThus, accumulated Yang is Heaven,\nAccumulated Yin is Earth.\nYin is still, Yang is agitated,\nYang is hot, Yin is cold.\nThat which governs Yin is Yang,\nThus agitation overcomes cold.\nThat which governs Yang is Yin,\nThus stillness overcomes heat.\n\nYet when cold departs, heat arrives,\nAnd when heat departs, cold returns—\nHow could their use ever be exhausted or depleted?\n\nThe Way has clarity and turbidity,\nMovement and stillness.\nClarity is the source of turbidity,\nStillness is the foundation of movement.\nIf one can always maintain clarity and stillness,\nThen Heaven and Earth will all return to it—\nWhat then of things?\nWhat then of affairs?\n\nThus it is said:\nClarity and purity are the rectitude of the world.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony with the Way**\nWhen the world is in harmony with the Way,\nEven warhorses are turned to manure.\nWhen the world lacks the Way,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is greater than coveting acquisition.\nThus, the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\nOne who governs the world with the Way\nAlways keeps the people without knowledge or desire,\nSo each person rests content in their place without contention,\nAnd merely tends their fields.\nBut in the declining ages,\nWhen the Way cannot be revived,\nThen they see what is desirable yet do not know sufficiency.\nThus arises the heart of coveting acquisition,\nAnd they begin to plunder, usurp, and trample boundaries,\nWhile warhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nReflecting upon oneself,\nWithin one’s own world lies the self.\nIf the Way is applied to the self,\nThen one accepts one’s measure,\nAnd guards one’s inch of land with depth.\nIf the Way is lost in the self,\nThen one gallops and hunts recklessly,\nAnd the heart grows mad,\nWhile the inch of land is already lost.\n\nThus, no guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is greater than coveting acquisition—\nAll are transgressions of not accepting one’s measure.\nWhen this becomes extreme, contention and plunder follow.\nIf one can accept the measure of life and destiny,\nAnd return desires to their source,\nMaintaining clarity and purity in self-cultivation,\nThen sufficiency is found within the self—\nHow could there be insufficiency?\nThis is how the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door, one knows the world;\nNot peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus, the Sage acts without moving yet knows,\nSees without looking yet names,\nAchieves without doing.\n\nThe world—\nThe nine regions, mountains, rivers, seas—\nTeeming with ceaseless generation.\nThe Way of Heaven—\nThe four seasons, Yin and Yang, winds and rains—\nEndless transformation.\n\nReflecting upon the self,\nNothing is not perfectly rounded.\nThus the Sage says:\n“I share with Heaven and Earth one breath and govern together.”\nIf one understands this,\nThen one need not leave the door or peer through the window\nTo know and see the Way of Heaven and Earth.\nIf one seeks the Way beyond the self,\nThen the farther one goes, the less one knows.\nHow could one not know that within one body,\nTen thousand principles are all complete?\nTaking from the near,\nNothing is insufficient.\n\nThus the Sage embodies Earth’s Way,\nWith emptiness as the body,\nSo he acts without moving yet knows,\nWithout need to leave the door;\nEmbodies Heaven’s Way,\nWith non-action as the heart,\nSo he sees without looking yet names,\nWithout need to peer through the window;\nEmbodies the Great Way,\nWith naturalness as the constant,\nSo he achieves without doing,\nWithout need to exert intelligence in what is seen or done.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: Daily Learning and Daily Decline**\nDaily learning increases,\nDaily practice of the Way decreases.\nDecrease again and again,\nUntil reaching non-action yet nothing remains undone.\nThus, to take the world is always through non-affairs.\nBut when affairs arise,\nThey are insufficient to take the world.\n\nThe scholar seeks to exhaust principles,\nThus daily increase.\nThe practitioner of the Way seeks to perfect nature,\nThus daily decrease.\nDecrease again and again,\nUntil perfecting nature to its end—\nThis is reaching destiny.\nPrinciples have an end,\nNature has an exhaustion,\nYet one is not yet free from doing,\nThus it is called learning and practicing the Way.\nOnly when destiny is reached,\nDoes one return to the root—stillness.\nStillness is called returning to destiny,\nUntil reaching non-action.\n\nNon-action—\nThe time of tranquil, unmoving stillness—\nYet when moved, it responds and communicates with the world,\nThus it is also action.\nHence, non-action yet nothing remains undone.\n\nIf there is any doing,\nOne cannot avoid entangling in affairs;\nIf there is no doing,\nOne cannot avoid severing connection with things.\nHow does the Sage act in the world?\nHe merely dwells in non-affairs.\nDwelling in non-affairs,\nOnly then can one take the world.\nThus, to take the world is always through non-affairs.\n\nYet the world’s sacred instrument\nCannot be forced—\nForcing it ruins it,\nClutching it loses it.\nWhen affairs arise,\nThey are still insufficient to take the world.\nKnowing the world cannot be taken through affairs,\nOne must instead learn what is not learned,\nTo reach the Way of non-action.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**",

struck by armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to strike its claws,\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no place of death for him.\n\nAll things arise from the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth—this is called life,\nAnd return to the transformations of yin and yang—this is called death.\nThose who follow life and death\nHave not escaped the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nNor have they avoided the transformations of yin and yang.\nYet, all things are born and die,\nWhile only humanity’s life is said to stir death’s domain thirteenfold—why?\nThis is all self-inflicted by the people,\nNot Heaven and Earth’s destruction,\nNor the harm of ghosts and spirits—\nFor they possess knowledge and their forms move.\n\nThey cannot turn away from life’s approach when seen,\nNor halt death’s departure when it comes—why?\nBecause of life’s excessive vitality,\nAnd the stirring of death’s domain.\nOnly the Sage embraces subtlety and simplicity,\nHolding to the uncarved and unadorned,\nDaring not to act or contend with the world.\nThough fierce beasts may be present, they cannot seize him,\nThough weapons may be drawn, they cannot harm him.\nFor his accumulated virtue is profound and boundless,\nAnd nothing can injure him—\nHence, there is no place of death for him.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao/Way Gives Life**\nThe Dao/Way gives life,\nVirtue/power nurtures it,\nForm shapes it,\nConditions perfect it—\nThus, all things honor the Dao/Way and value virtue/power.\n\nThe Dao/Way’s honor,\nVirtue/power’s nobility—\nNo one bestows these titles,\nYet they remain ever natural.\nTherefore, the Dao/Way gives life and nurtures it,\nLengthens it and rears it,\nPerfects it and ripens it,\nNourishes it and protects it.\nGiving life yet not possessing it,\nActing yet not claiming it,\nLengthening yet not controlling it—\nThis is called profound virtue/power.\n\nWhere does the Dao/Way arise to give life?\nIt gathers the true and harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd all things follow to be born—\nThis is how the Dao/Way gives life—\nHence, it is said: *The Dao/Way gives life, virtue/power nurtures it.*\n\nWhere do forms arise?\nFollowing the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the transformations of yin and yang—\nAll things follow to be formed—\nThis is how forms arise—\nHence, it is said: *Form shapes it, conditions perfect it.*\n\nBecause the Dao/Way can give life,\nAll things bow to it—\nThis is called honoring the Dao/Way.\nBecause virtue/power can nurture life,\nAll things cannot belittle it—\nThis is called valuing virtue/power.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way and virtue/power dwell above the accumulated *yang*,\nNot seeking honor or nobility from things—\nThings honor and value themselves,\nFor from ancient times to the present,\nNo titles are bestowed yet they remain ever natural.\n\nTherefore, the Dao/Way gives life and nurtures it,\nLengthens it and rears it,\nPerfects it and ripens it,\nNourishes it and protects it—\nThis is the Dao/Way acting naturally between Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one gives life yet does not possess it,\nActs yet does not claim it,\nLengthens yet does not control it—\nThis is the common practice of Heaven and Earth,\nHence, it is called profound virtue/power.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: Heaven and Earth as the Origin of All Under Heaven**\nAll under Heaven has its origin,\nWhich we call the Mother of all under Heaven.\nHaving obtained its Mother,\nWe know its children—\nHaving known its children,\nWe return to guard its Mother,\nAnd thus our life is never endangered.\n\nBlock the *fui* (mouth/opening),\nClose the gate—\nAnd thus we never tire throughout our lives.\nOpen the *fui*,\nAdvance our affairs—\nAnd thus we never find salvation throughout our lives.\n\nSeeing what is small is called clarity,\nGuarding what is soft is called strength.\nUsing its light,\nYet returning to its clarity—\nWe suffer no harm to our bodies,\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nOne life of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd then all under Heaven has its origin—\nThus we call it the Mother of all under Heaven.\nHaving obtained Heaven and Earth,\nAs the Mother of all under Heaven,\nWe then know that all things are her children.\nHaving known her children,\nYet returning to guard the Mother—\nThen all her children are preserved.\n\nPeople only know Heaven and Earth and all things,\nYet do not know their own source of life.\nIf one knows this source,\nAnd returns to guard the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nThen one’s life is never endangered.\n\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth\nEngage in non-action,\nPractice the teaching of no words—\nHence, it is said: *Block the fui, close the gate,*\nAnd thus we never tire throughout our lives.\nThose who do not know the Dao/Way\nEngage in much speech and action,\nAnd thus lose guard of the Mother’s Dao/Way\nBy attending to worldly affairs—\nHence, it is said: *Open the fui, advance our affairs,*\nAnd thus we never find salvation throughout our lives.\n\nThe small is the uncarved of Heaven and Earth,\nThe soft is the subtle application of the Dao/Way—\nOnly by self-knowledge can one see the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nHence, it is called clarity.\nOnly by self-mastery can one guard the subtlety of the Dao/Way,\nHence, it is called strength.\n\nClarity is the harmonization of yin and yang,\nAnd light arises from clarity—\nUsing non-action,\nWithin oneself, wisdom and intent are present.\nThe Sage discards wisdom and knowledge,\nNot relying on them yet illuminating the Dao/Way of Heaven—\nHence, he uses its light\nAnd returns to its clarity.\nLight shining outward is called suffering harm—\nTo suffer no harm to oneself yet return to clarity,\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nThus, one can guard the Mother’s Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Thief of the Dao/Way**\nIf I were to have knowledge and walk the Great Dao/Way,\nI would only fear this one thing:\nThe Great Dao/Way is exceedingly smooth,\nYet people love shortcuts.\n\nMorning is

Dao/Way,\nNot the Dao/Way itself.\n\nThe streams of mountain paths,\nIf used, become roads—\nIf not, are choked with weeds.\nThe people of the world do not know the subtlety of the Great Dao/Way,\nYet they act and contrive—\nThis is how they bring weeds to their hearts.\n\nKnowledge’s movement is called action,\nAction’s artifice is called loss—\nThus, those with knowledge fear and dare not act.\nThe Great Dao/Way is exceedingly smooth,\nYet when viewed, it is unseen—\nPeople’s hearts desire speed,\nThus they love shortcuts and forever stray from the Great Dao/Way.\n\nMoreover, the heart is the sovereign’s office—\nThus when the heart is disturbed, even a single *mu* (inch) of land is lost.\nWhen a single *mu* of land is lost,\nThe harmonious *qi* does not descend—\nWhen the harmonious *qi* does not descend,\nThe great granary is emptied—\nHence, it is said: *Morning is neglected, fields grow overgrown, granaries lie empty.*\n\nBecause of this,\nThey create distinctions of high and low,\nAnd strange contests of contention—\nThey crave the delicacy of the five flavors,\nHence, they wear ornate attire,\nGird on sharp blades,\nSicken of food and drink—\nAnd when wealth is abundant,\nThey gather the roots of all harm.",

called *accumulation*.\n\n*Restraint* outwardly reaches *without desire*,\nThus they *postpone* their own bodies,\n*Externally* their own bodies,\nSo they may *govern people*.\n\n*Accumulation* inwardly reaches *without knowledge*,\nThus they *preserve* their hearts,\n*Nourish* their *nature* (性),\nSo they may *serve Heaven*.\n\nExternally, without desire, they follow the *stillness of Earth* (地) and *fulfill their nature* (尽性);\nInternally, without knowledge, they *embody Heaven’s functions* (体天之用) and *return to the original command* (复命).\n\nTo *fulfill their nature* (尽性) and *return to the original command* (复命),\nThis is *reverting back to guard its source*—\nHence it is called *early return* (早复).\n\n*Early* (早) means the sun rises at the *beginning of the Jia-Yang* (甲阳);\nTo *revert and guard its source* (复守其母),\nIs to *align with Heaven and Earth in virtue*—\nThis is called *accumulating virtue in earnest* (重积德).\n\n*Accumulating virtue* (积德) is *profoundly harmonious*,\n*Aligned with the true Dao* (与道合真),\nThus there is no failure—\n*Aligned with the true Dao* (与道合真),\nIt is *inexhaustible and boundless*—\nHence its limits are *unknowable*.\n\n*Inexhaustible and boundless* (难终难穷),\nAll ten thousand principles are *fully manifest*—\nHence it can *have a lasting state*.\n\nThe *foundation of a lasting state*,\nIs the *Dao/Way*—\nNeither *rigidly square* (不方) nor *circularly confined* (不圆),\nParallel with *Heaven and Earth*—\nHence it can endure forever.\n\n*Beginning with guarding its source* (始於守母),\nThis is called *deepening its roots*;\n*Ending with returning to the original command* (终於复命),\nThis is called *firming its foundation*.\nTo *obtain Heaven and Earth as constants* (得天地为常) while the *Five Phases do not mutually subdue* (五行不相克),\nTo *align with the Great Dao as One* (与大道为一) while the *Three Lights* (三光) remain *unilluminated and obscure* (无明冥),\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of longevity and enduring vision*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States Like Simmering Small Fish**\n\nTo govern great states,\nIs like *simmering small fresh fish* (烹小鲜).\n\nTo *apply the Dao/Way to rule the world* (以道莅天下),\nTheir *spirits* (鬼) are not *divine* (神).\nNot that their *spirits are not divine*,\nBut that the *divine spirits do not harm the people*;\nNot that the *divine spirits do not harm the people*,\nThe Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nThus, *both do not harm each other*—\nHence their *virtue/power* (德) *returns and exchanges* (交归).\n\nTo govern by the *Dao/Way* values *purity and clarity* (清浄),\nAnd the people *self-regulate* (民自定).\nDo not *act upon* them—\nHence, governing great states is like *simmering small fresh fish*.\n\nFrom the perspective of humanity,\nGreat states are *Heaven’s central earthly gateways* (天中地户),\nThe *domain of the Yellow Emperor* (黄帝之乡),\nThus they are governed in this manner.\n\nHence the Sage *acts in non-action* (处无为之事),\nWith a *single heart settled* (一心定),\nAnd *rules the world* (而王天下).\nThus the *spirits* have no place to *manifest their divine resonance* (出其灵响),\nRelying on humanity to move—\nWhat *divinity* is there?\n\nNot that their *spirits are not divine*—\nBecause they *do not receive evil* (不受於邪),\nEvil *qi* *spontaneously departs* (邪气自去),\nThus the *divine spirits do not harm humanity*.\n\nNot that the *divine spirits do not harm humanity*—\nBecause the Sage *acts in non-action*,\nAnd the world *transforms harmoniously* (化成),\nMaking the people *externally free from strife, contention, or warfare* (无争夺攻战之患),\n*Internally free from scheming, murder, or resentment* (无图为杀怨之心),\nNot *offending divine retribution* (不犯神之报应),\nThus the Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nWhen *humanity and spirits* (人与鬼神) *both do not harm each other*,\nThe *spirits* grant *abundant blessings* (予矣, 贻尔多福),\n*Returning virtue to the spirits*—\nThe people *simplify* (质矣),\n*Daily nourishment and sustenance* (日用饮食),\n*Returning virtue to humanity*.\n\n*Returning virtue to the spirits*,\nThus their descendants *sacrifice without ceasing* (子孙以祭祀不辍).\n*Returning virtue to humanity*,\nThus the world *joyfully follows* (天下乐推),\n*Never tiring* (而不厌).\n\nThis is the *effect* (效) of the Sage *applying the Dao/Way to rule the world*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**\n\nGreat states are *lowly flows* (下流),\nThe *nexus of the world* (天下之交),\nThe *receptive* (牝) of the world.\n\nThe *receptive* (牝) is always *stillness overcomes the active* (静胜牡),\nAnd *stillness is lowly* (静为下).\nThus, when great states *lower themselves to the small* (以下小国),\nThey *take the small*;\nWhen small states *lower themselves to the great* (小国以下大国),\nThey *take the great*.\nThus, *either lower to take* (或下以取),\n*Or lower and take* (或下而取).\n\nGreat states *do not exceed* their desire to *comprehend and nourish people* (兼畜人),\nSmall states *do not exceed* their desire to *enter and serve the great* (入事人).\nBoth *obtain what they desire*—\nHence the *great should be lowly* (大者宜为下).\n\nWater *excel in flowing downward*—\nThus the *Yangtze and seas can rule all valleys* (江海能为百谷王).\nGreat states desire to *comprehend and nourish people*—\nThis is also achieved through their *lowly flow*—\nHence it is said, *great states are lowly flows*.\n\nThe world’s *nexus* (交),\nAll things *generate*;\nHuman *nexus* (道交),\n*Merits and achievements are fulfilled*—\nThis is called the *nexus of the world*—\nYet it must *first be treated with gentleness and stillness* (自处以柔静).\n\nThe *receptive* (牝) is always *stillness overcomes the active* (静胜牡),\nAnd the *active* (牡) *returns to it*—\nBecause *stillness is lowly* (静为下).\n\n*Stillness* means *no affairs*—\nOnly *no affairs* can *take the world*—\nAnd what of *states*?\n\nThus, when great states *lower themselves to the small*,\nThey *take the small*;\nWhen small states *lower themselves to the great*,\nThey *take the great*.\n\n*Either lower to take* (或下以取),\nIs the *Dao/Way of the sovereign* (君道).\n*Or lower and take* (或下而取),\nIs the *Dao/Way of the minister* (臣道).\n\nThe *sovereign* is like *Heaven*—\nHeaven’s *Dao/Way* flows *downward to aid* (下济) while *radiant and clear*—\nThus great states *do not exceed* their desire to *comprehend and nourish people*.\n\nThe *minister* is like *Earth*—\nEarth’s *Dao/Way* is *lowly yet ascends* (卑而上行)—\nThus small states *do not exceed* their desire to *enter and serve the great*.\n\nWhen *Heaven and Earth exchange* (交),\nAll things *generate*;\nWhen *human nexus* (道交) is fulfilled,\n*Merits and achievements are completed*—\nThus both *obtain what they desire*.\n\nYet those who should *flow downward* (宜下流者),\nAre only great states—\nHence it is again said, *the great should be lowly*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**\n\nThe *Dao/Way* (道) is the *mystery of all things* (万物之奥),\nThe *treasure of the virtuous* (善人之宝),\nThe *protection of the unvirtuous* (不善人之所保).\n\n*Graceful words* (美言) can *win favor* (可以市),\n*Noble conduct* (尊行) can *elevate one* (可以加人).\nHumanity’s unvirtue—\nWhat can be *abandoned*?\nHence the *establishment of the Son of Heaven* (立天子),\nThe *appointment of the Three Ministers* (置三公),\nEven with *a jade tablet and white horses* (拱璧以先驷马),\nIs *not as valuable* as *sitting and presenting this Dao* (不如坐进此道).\n\nWhy did the ancients *value this Dao*?\nWas it not for *seeking and obtaining* (求以得),\nOr *pardoning faults* (有罪以免)?\n\nThus it is *precious for the world*.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is the *abyss of emptiness and nothingness* (虚无之渊),\nAll see *things* (物) yet *do not see the Dao* (不见乎道),\nHence it is called the *mystery of all things*.\n\nThe *mystery of attaining the Dao* (得道之妙),\nIs the *treasure of life and nature* (性命之宝).\nThe *mystery of speaking the Dao* (得道之言),\nIs unvirtue—\nYet even the unvirtuous *find protection in the Dao*.\n\n*Win favor* (市) is where *the masses gather* (众人之所归).\n*Elevate one* (加) is to *place them above the masses* (置诸众人之上).\nGraceful words and noble conduct—\nEven the

Is it merely to pardon faults?\n\nThus, it is held precious by all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 63: *Wuwei* (無為)**\n*Wuwei* in action, *wuwei* in affairs, *wuwei* in taste.\nGreat and small, much and

      "translated_text": "The blessing of the state lies in *opening heaven*—virtue gives life.\n\nThese two principles are models to emulate and patterns to follow. To know the models, one must then observe the Dao, hence it is called *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue). *Xuan De* is the highest virtue, thus profound and far-reaching. Nothing can pair with it except aligning with the great harmony, hence one must reverse with things to attain the great harmony.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (Jianghai)**\nJianghai becomes the king of all valleys because it excels in humility, thus it rules over all valleys. Therefore, the Sage desires to be above others by speaking humbly, to lead others by placing himself last. Thus, when the Sage is above, the people do not feel burdened; when he is before, the people are not harmed. Hence, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion. Because he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.\n\nJianghai, by its excellence in humility, receives the flow of all valleys and becomes their king. The king has the principle of returning and going, thus the noble humble themselves, the great humble themselves, and the people are gained.\n\nTherefore, the Sage embodies the Dao of Heaven and speaks humbly, so when he is above, the people do not feel burdened, hence they follow him lightly. He embodies the Dao of Earth and places himself last, so when he is before, the people are not harmed, hence those who benefit him are many. Thus, from the west to the east, from the south to the north, none fail to submit willingly, hence all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.\n\nEssentially, the reason for this is nothing more than excellence in humility. Only those who excel in humility do not contend with things, hence none under heaven can contend with them.\n\n**Chapter 67: All Under Heaven Say**\nAll under heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unskilled. Only because it is great does it seem unskilled. If it were skilled, it would have been long ago. I possess three treasures; I hold them fast. The first is *ci* (compassion), the second is *jian* (frugality), the third is *not daring to act first under heaven*.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous; frugality makes one vast. Not daring to act first under heaven makes one the vessel and leader. Now, if one abandons compassion and courage, abandons frugality and vastness, abandons humility and acting first, one dies.\n\nCompassion—when waging war, one wins; when defending, one is steadfast. Heaven, intending to save it, guards it with compassion. Those who imitate things are small; those imitated by things are great.\n\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, fills the six extremes, vast and great—thus it seems unskilled. Heaven is great, Earth is great; they imitate the Dao, hence they endure. Yet Heaven and Earth are but a small thing within the void—compared to the Dao, they are also small. Thus I hold fast to my three treasures.\n\nThe first, *ci* (compassion), is the fatherly Dao, the master of creation—speaking of Heaven. The second, *jian* (frugality), is the motherly Dao, the master of nurturing and gathering—speaking of Earth. The third, *not daring to act first under heaven*, is the origin of Heaven and Earth—responding only after being moved, never acting first—speaking of the Dao.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and the Dao together are used, then serene and boundless, with all virtues following. No treasures surpass these three. All people possess them; they should be cherished and not lost, held as the highest.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven gives birth and covers—this is called compassion. Though compassionate, it does not contend yet wins—thus compassion makes one courageous. The Dao of Earth nurtures and gathers—this is called frugality. Though frugal, its virtue extends boundlessly—thus frugality makes one vast.\n\nOnly the great Dao encompasses the origins of Heaven and Earth; though it does not dare act first under heaven, life and transformation depend on it, hence it becomes the vessel and leader. If one opposes Heaven and Earth and severs the great Dao, then one dies.\n\nCompassion in war brings victory—it battles *yin* with *yang*. In defense, it is steadfast—embracing the Dao of the Mysterious. Moreover, when contending with disorder, waiting for the time to act, then victory is achieved by responding. If it cannot move, it defends with harmony, and Heaven’s timing also guards it firmly, hence Heaven intends to save it, guarding it with compassion.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**\nThe virtuous warrior is not martial; the virtuous fighter does not rage; the virtuous victor does not contend; the virtuous user of people places himself below them. This is called the virtue of non-contention, the strength of using people, aligning with Heaven—ancient perfection.\n\nThe virtuous warrior cherishes the Dao of the three treasures, not using force to overpower under heaven with arms. Thus, in waging war, this is virtuous fighting; in defeating enemies, this is virtuous victory; in using people, this is virtuous leadership.\n\nThe virtuous fighter waits for the time before acting, though fighting yet not raging—embodying the treasure of compassion. The virtuous victor considers victory before meeting, though victorious yet not contending—embodying the treasure of frugality. The virtuous leader does not scheme for himself but delights in using others, hence people willingly serve him—embodying the treasure of *not daring to act first under heaven*.\n\nThose skilled in this are said to possess the virtue of non-contention, the strength of using people, aligning with Heaven. Yet ancient correctness becomes strange, thus there are warnings about using arms, hence it is called ancient perfection.\n\nWho knows its perfection?\n\n**Chapter 69: The Art of War**\nThe art of war has sayings: *I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender, not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.* This is called *no action in action, no arm in defense, no rival in enmity, no weapon in grasp.*\n\nNo greater calamity than despising the enemy—despising the enemy nearly loses my treasures. Thus, when armies clash, the compassionate win.\n\nThe sayings of war clarify that these words are not mine but the common words of those who use arms. *I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender*—thus pressed, I act; compelled, I rise, never provoking others, only responding.",

to act strangely,\nI could seize and execute them—\nThis is called *lacking virtue/power* (无德) in governing with contracts.\n\nThe people do not long fear death,\nYet one tries to terrify them with death—\nIs this not like substituting for the great carpenter?\n\nThe great carpenter who chops all things,\nIs the master of creation.\n\nThe master of creation,\nFollows Heaven’s Dao/Way of *non-action* (无为).\n\nThose who go against Heaven and control creation,\nAre those of *action* (有为)—\nFew would escape self-harm.\n\n**The People’s Hunger (Chapter 75)**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers taxing them too heavily—\nThus, they hunger.\n\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act—\nThus, they are hard to govern.\n\nThe people grow careless about death because their rulers provide them with abundant life—\nThus, they grow careless about death.\n\nOnly those who do not exploit life’s provisions,\nAre wiser than those who cherish life.\n\nThe king regards the people as Heaven,\nAnd the people regard food as Heaven.\n\nThe **sage**’s governance reduces punishments,\nLightens taxes and levies,\nKnowing Heaven’s Heaven,\nThen the people can be preserved.\n\nThe abundance of taxes arises from heavy burdens,\nYet the rulers do not know to lighten taxes and levies to nourish the people—\nThus, the people’s hunger.\n\nThe rulers’ *action* (有为) arises from their troublesome governance,\nYet they do not know to reduce punishments and levies to bring peace—\nThus, the people’s difficulty in being governed.\n\nIn general, human nature thrives in wealth and prosperity,\nThen steadfastness arises;\nReturns to simplicity and purity,\nThen other desires vanish.\n\nAs for hunger and difficulty in governance,\nThey do not secure their proper share,\nYet their desire for profit grows ever more insistent—\nThus, some are driven to excess in life and into the realm of death,\nHence, the people’s carelessness about death.\n\nOnly those who grasp the Dao,\nGuard within a single measure yet *qi* (氣) harmonizes naturally,\nTheir essence undiminished yet Heaven’s protection is complete.\n\nSuch people understand the nature of life,\nDo not pursue what cannot be done by *action* (有为),\nAre wiser than those who cherish life,\nAnd differ from those who exploit life’s abundance and grow careless about death.\n\n**The Nature of Human Life (Chapter 76)**\nHumanity’s living is soft and weak,\nYet its dying is firm and strong.\n\nGrasses and trees in their living are soft and brittle,\nYet in their dying, they wither and decay.\n\nThus, firm and strong are the companions of death,\nSoft and weak are the companions of life.\n\nHence, strong armies do not conquer,\nStrong wood is easily broken.\n\nThus, firm and strong must dwell below,\nSoft and weak must be above.\n\nHumanity’s living,\nBones are weak, sinews are soft,\nYet in dying,\nSinews and bones grow firm and strong.\n\nGrasses and trees in their living,\nBark is brittle, branches are soft,\nYet in dying,\nBranches and leaves wither and decay.\n\nThus, firm and strong are the companions of death,\nSoft and weak are the companions of life—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nStrong armies do not conquer,\nNor does strong wood endure—\nThis aligns with the same principle.\n\nFirm and strong are companions of death,\nThus, they dwell below.\n\nSoft and weak are companions of life,\nThus, they are above.\n\nThis is also the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth that ought to be so.\n\n**Heaven’s Dao/Way (Chapter 77)**\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is like drawing a bow—\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way diminishes excess and supplements deficiency,\nYet humanity’s Dao/Way is not so—\nThey diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nWho can diminish the excessive to serve the deficient in the world?\nOnly the Dao.\n\nThus, the **sage** acts yet does not rely on it,\nCompletes the task yet does not claim it—\nThis is why they do not seek to display their virtue/power.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way attains perfection through moderation,\nWithout excess or deficiency.\n\nIs it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, so they do not have excess—\nThus, the excessive are diminished.\nThe low are raised, so they do not lack—\nThus, the deficient are supplemented.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way reduces fullness and excess,\nSupplements emptiness and void,\nDestroys strength and vigor,\nBenefits decay and weakness—\nYet humanity’s Dao/Way is entirely contrary to this,\nDiminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nThose who can serve the world with the Dao of excess,\nOnly Heaven’s Dao/Way does so.\n\nThe **sage** embodies the Dao,\nThus, they act yet do not rely on it,\nComplete the task yet do not claim it—\nThey never use their strengths to display themselves to others,\nHence, they are always without harm,\nThis is how the **sage** can align with Heaven.\n\n**The Gentle and Weak in the World (Chapter 78)**\nIn the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nYet in attacking firm and strong things, nothing can surpass it,\nBecause there is nothing to replace it.\n\nThe gentle overcome the rigid,\nThe weak overcome the strong—\nAll in the world know this,\nYet none can practice it.\n\nThus, the **sage** says:\nTo bear the filth of the state,\nThis is the duty of the lord of the soil and grain;\nTo bear the misfortunes of the state,\nThis is the duty of the king of the world.\n\nStraightforward words as if reversed.\n\nIn the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nYet it can attack firm and strong things—\nNothing can overcome it,\nBecause it has constancy and nothing can replace it,\nThus, it approaches the Dao.",
      "overlap_context": "hor? Who can truly know its reason?\nMoreover, Heaven’s Dao/Way diminishes excess yet benefits humility—\nThus, those who follow Heaven endure, while those who oppose it perish—\nHence, the **sage** (圣人) finds it difficult and does not dare to act.\nHeaven’s Dao/Way has no purpose—\nAll things emerging, it emerges with them without refusal;\nAll things returning, it returns with them without rejection—\nAll things receive their mandate from this, hence it is called *not contending yet conquering well*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Gentle and Weak in the World (Chapter 78, continued)**\nThe gentle overcome the rigid,\nThe weak overcome the strong—\nYet all in the world know this,\nAnd none can practice it.\nWhy so?\nBecause they increase life,\nAnd because their hearts command their **qi**,\nThus they lose the **Dao** of gentle and weak.\n\nNow, what is gentle and weak yet constant,\nAnd nothing can replace it?\nOnly the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth.\nThe **Dao** of Earth:\nBears the filth of the state,\nAnd does not transform itself—\nYet it transforms all else,\nThus it is called the lord of the soil and grain.\nIs this not what is meant by\n*The gentle overcoming the rigid?*\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven:\nBears the misfortunes of the state,\nAnd does not generate itself—\nYet it generates all else,\nThus it is called the king of the world.\nIs this not what is meant by\n*The weak overcoming the strong?*\n\nThat which is straightforward yet seems reversed—\nBearing the filth of the state and its misfortunes.\nWith straightforward words,\nIt seems reversed indeed.\n\n**Harmonizing Great Grievances (Chapter 79)**\nHarmonizing great grievances,\nMust leave some lingering resentment—\nHow can this be called good?\nThus, the **sage** holds the left half of the contract,\nAnd does not demand repayment from others.\n\nTherefore, one with **virtue** governs the contract,\nOne without **virtue** governs the final settlement.\nThe **Dao** of Heaven has no favorites,\nIt always aligns with those of virtue.\n\nYang is **virtue**—\nIt does nothing.\nYin is resentment—\nIt does much.\n\nIn the world, people act boldly in daring to do,\nThus they have resentment.\nAdding wisdom, kindness, and righteousness to harmonize great grievances,\nOnly makes resentment more abundant.\n\nIf this is so,\nHow can it be called good?\n\nMoreover, wisdom and kindness are external,\nRighteousness and propriety bring many demands—\nThus bold action leads to more resentment.\n\nTherefore, the **sage** follows Heaven’s course,\nDwelling in non-action,\nPracticing speechless teaching,\nGiving to others yet never taking—\nThus they do not demand repayment,\nAnd resentment has no place.\n\nThis is called the **virtue** of the **sage** above—\nTo bear resentment with **virtue**,\nThus it is said: *One with **virtue** governs the contract.*\n\nThis is called the **virtue** of the **sage** below—\nTo act boldly yet harmonize resentment,\nThus it is said: *One without **virtue** governs the final settlement.*\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven—\nThis is the **virtue** of the **sage** above—\nNo partiality, no bias,\nOnly those who act in non-action\nAre always favored by Heaven.\n\n**The Small State and Few People (Chapter 80)**\nA small state with few people,\nLets the people have tenfold and hundredfold tools,\nYet does not use them;\nLets the people value death,\nYet does not flee their homeland.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nThey have no place to ride them;\nThough there are arms and armor,\nThey have no place to display them;\nThey return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nThey delight in their food,\nAdorn their clothing,\nFind peace in their customs,\nTake joy in their livelihoods.\n\nNeighboring states are visible,\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nYet they do not visit one another,\nUntil they die of old age without meeting.\n\nNine corners, eight districts,\nSheltered within a small state.\nIn the age of supreme **virtue**,\nThe land is not expanded,\nThe people are not multiplied—\nYet they can make one state like a family,\nOne family like a single body.\n\nI love stillness,\nAnd the people naturally align.\nThough wise men may lead in front,\nAnd clever ones may confuse behind,\nThe people bear no burden of scheming—\nThus they are allowed to have tenfold and hundredfold tools,\nYet do not use them.\n\nIn such times,\nThe people all take joy in life,\nFind comfort in their native soil,\nGuard their own state—\nThus they value death,\nYet do not flee their homeland.\nBecause they do not flee,\nThere are no dangers of rivers and roads—\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nThey have no place to ride them;\nNo calamities of war—\nThough there are arms and armor,\nThey have no place to display them.\n\nGreat trust requires no oaths—\nWhat need for written contracts?\nThus they return to using knotted cords.\n\nTherefore, they diligently till the fields,\nAnd find their food sweet;\nThey personally tend the mulberry trees,\nAnd find their clothing fine;\nThey cherish their homeland,\nAnd find their dwelling secure;\nThey preserve life,\nAnd find their customs joyful.\n\nThough their dwellings are close,\nAnd their voices are heard,\nThey do not visit one another—\nNo desires, no demands—\nThey act without pretense,\nYet all things naturally unfold.\nThis is called supreme **virtue**.\n\n**The Sage’s Speech is Not Ornate (Chapter 81)**\nThe **sage’s** words are not ornate,\nOrnate words are not **sage**.\nThe good do not argue,\nThe argumentative are not good.\nThe wise do not display vast knowledge,\nThe learned are not truly wise.\n\nThe **sage** has no accumulation—\nThe more they give to others,\nThe more they possess;\nThe more they share with others,\nThe more they have.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven:\nBenefits without harming.\nThe **Dao** of the **sage**:\nActs without competing.\n\nThe **sage’s** words are few—\nWhen they speak,\nTheir words are simple, without taste—\nThus they are not ornate.\n\nOrnate words are mere appearances—\nWhen they deal with others,\nLight promises bring few trustworthy deeds—\nThus they are not trusted.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven does not speak,\nYet always responds with goodness—\nThus the good do not argue.\n\nHarmonizing great grievances—\nHow can this be called good?\nThus the argumentative are not good.\n\nThose who know the **Dao** must reach the **principle**—\nReaching the **principle** means they will use reverse speech to govern.\nThus the wise do not display vast knowledge.\n\nKnowledge that is too broad confuses the mind—\nThe more one hears and sees,\nThe less they can grasp the essential—\nThus the learned are not truly wise.\n\nNot ornate,\nNot argumentative,\nNot vast in knowledge—\nThis is called *having nothing to dwell upon within oneself.*\n\nThe **Dao** of the **sage** is to have nothing to dwell upon within oneself—\nThus they move without accumulation,\nAnd the **sage** has no accumulation.\nBecause of accumulation, they are insufficient;\nBecause of no hoarding, they have abundance.\n\nThe **sage** has no accumulation—\nThus they can use the **Dao** of abundance\nTo nourish the world.\nAll under Heaven come to depend on them,\nYet they are never exhausted—\nThus the more they give to others,\nThe more they possess;\nThe more they share with others,\nThe more they have.\n\nThe **Dao** of the **sage** is the **Dao** of Heaven—\nThe **Dao** of Heaven benefits without harming,\nThus the **Dao** of the **sage** acts without competing.\n\nMoreover, Heaven uses beauty and benefit\nTo benefit the world—\nWhat harm could there be?\nThe **sage** emerges from non-action,\nYet does not disrupt Heaven’s natural order,\nNor go against the inclinations of things—\nAgain, what is there to compete over?\n\nThis is the *De Jing* speaking,\nAnd its words conclude here—\nBecause **virtue** encompasses the **Dao**,\nAnd the **Dao** encompasses Heaven.\nIf one does not understand Heaven,\nThey will not grasp the **sage**—\nThus the *Mixed Primordium* ends here.\n\nThe ancient **sages** revealed their teachings through the **Dao**,\nAnd demonstrated the **Dao** through their words.\nThe **Dao** is formless,\nMysterious and unfathomable—\nYet if they do not rely on words,\nHow could the **Dao** be made clear?\n\nIf words do not fully express meaning,\nThen they must be written down—\nTheir language is subtle and profound,\nDifficult to recognize—\nSubtle and profound,\nDifficult to recognize,\nScholars cannot know its root.",
