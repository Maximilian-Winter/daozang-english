  "full_translation": "**The *Qizhen Collection***\n\n**Title:** *Qizhen Collection* (*Collection for Awakening the True*). Composed by Liu Zhiyuan of the Yuan dynasty. Three juan.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Qizhen Collection* of Master Tongxuan of Mount Jinfeng**\n\nI humbly consider: to rightly order spring, summer, autumn, and winter, one must have a pointer to make them known; to fathom the subtle, wondrous, and all-pervading, one must rely on words to awaken understanding. Yet words are but shadows of the mind’s perceptions, and written characters are shadows of words. Thought is the mind’s shadow, speech the mind’s echo—neither possesses a true substance. Yet through them, principle may be exhausted, the subtlest mysteries dissolved, all errors obliterated, and not a single dharma clung to. What use, then, are words?\n\nYet if principle is not inscribed in words, it would be like fish without a trap—none would seek it—or like hares without snares—none could be caught. Generally speaking, words are the traps and snares for fish and hares, sufficient to record the essentials of the supreme Dao, to guide and govern the mechanisms of immortality. How could they be discarded?\n\nThus, the sages composed and expounded the *Yinfu* and the *Daode*, unfolding the essence of the wondrous origin. The worthies, emulating the sages, wrote books such as the *Chongxu* and the *Nanhua* sutras, striving to enlighten later awakened ones, leading them to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. How could they not employ words to do so?\n\nMoreover, in recent times, the Five True Lineages have branched into many schools, teachings flourishing in all directions. Qiu and Liu authored the *Panxi* and *Xianle* collections; Tan and Ma titled their works *Jinyu* and *Shuiyun*. Without exception, they all drummed and sang the winds of the mysterious, illuminating wisdom and insight like the bright moon in a frosty sky, universally reflected in a thousand pools. They enabled those who savor the Dao to chew its rich marrow, to recognize the right path and avoid the pitfalls of delusion. Was this not achieved through words clarifying principle?\n\nLater, those who grasped the dragon’s scales or clung to the phoenix’s wings, who expounded the Dao and bequeathed teachings to rescue the drowning and guide the lost—I have witnessed this in Master Tongxuan. The Master’s surname was Liu, his given name Zhiyuan, a native of Gaolou Village in Xici. Born with compassion and empathy, he cherished the ancestral teachings from childhood, delving deeply into the great vehicle’s canonical texts. In adulthood, he encountered the flourishing of the Dao’s fortune, when the multitude of teachings were released from vulgarity. He met Master Chaoran, who transmitted to him the principles of nurturing the true, preserving simplicity, seeing nature, and recognizing the mind—all rooted in non-action.\n\nThereupon, he abandoned what the masses loved and gathered what they discarded. With resolve, he directly entered the profound mystery, stepping through the gate of a myriad wonders. With one taste, the three observations became empty and pure; with a second, all eight directions turned crystalline. Manifesting transformation bodies in countless forms, he traversed the single path of life and death. The celestial mechanisms and wondrous Dao were already imprinted in his heart. Thus, every utterance and written word from his brush may be likened to strings of pearls and strands of jade, not carved or engraved but naturally transcending all contrived search and arrangement. Truly, this is a compass for learners, worthy of the finest calligraphers.\n\nThough but a single phrase or a lone character, his aim was to pry open the blind and rouse the deaf, enabling them to receive and apply the teachings—not merely to cultivate himself. Yet before his literary legacy could fully flourish, he suddenly departed the world. Having penetrated the six realms with unwavering certainty, he shattered the muddy pellet (of the brain) and ascended formlessly. His writings, though extant, remained obscure and little known.\n\nHis disciple, Li Zhiquan of Pingshui, fearing they would fade into oblivion over time, traveled extensively through Jin and Bing provinces. He gathered fragments from friends who recited them from memory and obtained eight or nine parts out of ten from the records of Liu Zhijian. Thus, he collected the remnants, assembled them into a single compilation, arranged them by category, and divided them into three scrolls, titling them *Qizhen* (*Awakening the True*).\n\nHe showed them to me, seeking my review, and repeatedly urged me to write a preface, hoping to have them published and widely disseminated. Upon repeated perusal, I found the text and principles clearly laid out like a go board, the wondrous insights scattered like stars. They can guide those wandering in the dark alleys into the great radiance of the pure and luminous realm. How could one who is not a luminous pearl of the mind, transcending heaven and earth, achieve such a feat?\n\nThough I am a descendant of the Dao’s lineage, my attainment of the Dao is but faint and indistinct. My talent is as light as a cicada’s wing, my words as shallow as a frog’s croak. How dare I strike the cloth drum before the Thunder Gate? Yet, compelled by his insistence and unable to refuse, I have roughly sketched a fraction of the Master’s literary brilliance and exemplary conduct with these humble words.\n\nWritten on the twenty-second day of the latter part of the fourth lunar month in the year of *jiachen* (1244). Inscribed at the beginning of the scroll.\n\nBy Dong Shiyan, the Elder of Fengyuan of Tongyangjinli.\n\n---\n\n**Qizhen Collection, Volume One**\nComposed by Liu Zhiyuan, Master Tongxuan of Mount Jinfeng\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n*In Response to Wang Anren’s Inquiry on Daily Practice*\n\nSilent and ceaseless, the breath fans no wind,\nJade path pierced through, bone-deep fire burns bright.\nAt Kun’s summit, the sun refines jade nectar,\nNine-nines of merit merge in ebb and flow.\n\n*Following Wang Yongzhang’s verse on wine*\n\nNo need for brewed ale or fermented grain’s bouquet,\nMy golden elixir’s savor alone endures.\nHeartless, I drink to dawn’s intoxication,\nMystic trance roams the land of endless night.\n\n*In harmony with Qi Ziming’s rhyme*\n\nShaking off dust from my lapels, I delight in the Dao’s realm,\nClapping my breast, I recall the moonlit homeland of old.\nA flask of spring’s hue in the realm of clarity,\nSelf and world vanish—both forgotten in ease.\n\n*Following Fan Qingshu’s rhyme*\n\nDeep in woods and springs, I recall the immortal’s abode,\nStealing moments to tend the moon’s radiance.\nLoving the Silver River’s wind and waves so still,\nI drift on rosy wings, sailing the magic raft.\n\n*Dongxi Zhao the Master’s tea offering*\n\nA jade bowl of sacred water, stirred with cinnabar,\nSkillful hands brew auspicious snowflake blooms.\nLong ago, Lu Tong savored its taste,\nNow I fully grasp it as the Yellow Sprout.\n\n*To Chang Lou’an*\n\nNo chase for court or mountain,\nOnly loving poverty’s idle days.\nMoonlit nights and dawn winds as sworn friends,\nNo craving for rank or purple sashes.\n\n*Again*\n\nDwelling in seclusion, joy unburdened by comfort,\nAlone amidst mist and emerald skies.\nNow standing, now walking, worldly cares dissolve,\nHalf singing, half dancing, a few smiles arise.\n\n*For Master Li*\n\nA line heard by the ear demands effort,\nOn the tongue, great vessels are hard to forge.\nTimed firing completes the seven-sevens,\nFlesh and bone fuse—even spirits gasp.\n\n*In harmony with Jianxuan’s rhyme*\n\nThe secluded chamber’s mirror outshines the Moon Palace,\nIlluminating all within as emptiness.\nManifesting everywhere, unburdened by things,\nLight shines inside and out—body perfectly whole.\n\n*Again in the same rhyme*\n\nThe empty chamber’s mirror, pure and still,\nNever permits the world to grind its sheen.\nIts light embraces all forms, ever responsive,\nImpartial in its work, never clinging to others.\n\n*On the Brush*\n\nStrong-boned, light-bodied, its tip sharp as a needle,\nObeying the hand’s ink, its nature unrestrained.\nBranches live, trunks die through ages past,\nYet still it pours forth, blackening hearts.\n\n*Evening Glow Pavilion at Yongzhen Hermitage*\n\nSunset hangs on the forest’s edge, sky clear,\nLight strikes the cloud pavilion, dazzling the eye.\nI have returned to the golden realm,\nNo half-grain of worldly dust lingers.\n\n*Bamboo at Gushen Hermitage*\n\nCloud-court hands planted the tall bamboo,\nStalwart joints, hollow hearts, unstained by dust.\nDefying snow, scorning cold, its spirit rare,\nEvergreen through all four seasons’ spring.\n\n*Leaving Home Without Awakening*\n\nSevering love, I sought the path beyond the world,\nYet only plunged into day and night’s frantic labor.\nBoasting of tending a few acres,\nEven an inch of the magic field lies barren.\n\n*Expressing My Feelings*\n\nBrewed slowly, the deathless draft,\nDrunk in bliss, I enter the immortal’s land.\nSobering, I bathe in the unborn body,\nSuddenly sensing golden waves filling my belly.\n\n*Mid-Autumn Moon Gazing*\n\nFull moon’s shadow chills like ice,\nIts radiance pierces the golden sky, boundless.\nI see the true form of perfect clarity,\nNo need to point a finger to see.\n\n*Resting at Pine Pavilion*\n\nStraw sandals, bamboo staff, I rest in the thatched hut,\nFacing the pine pavilion, vast as the void.\nWind stilled, mist cold, the sky endless,\nI seem to wander the old land of Hua Xu.\n\n*Hearing the Zither at Pine Pavilion*\n\nPine Pavilion stirs to shed worldly dust,\nThree strains of the jade zither, one wisp of incense.\nMurmuring winds, rustling strings,\nNo need for misty isles to hear immortal tunes.\n\n*Following Cai Qing’s Rhyme*\n\nWithin heaven, another heaven unfolds,\nExpanding the power of creation within.\nEmbodied in the Great Void, without form,\nIt manifests as solitary perfection in all ten directions.\n\n*Admonishing the Assembly*\n\nThe Dao embraces earth and the three heavens,\nDo not cling to the mindless—merge with nature.\nWhen practice aligns with Heaven’s timing,\nOnly then does the pearl of nature shine round.\n\n*The Moon of Nature*\n\nNot a wisp of cloud veils the frosty sky,\nThe moon of nature hangs, supremely bright.\nResponsive across the three realms and ten directions,\nA thousand pools reflect its perfect roundness at once.\n\n*Jin River*\n\nThe Jin’s waters flow cold, unafraid of chill,\nWarm as if boiling, spraying mist and cloud.\nI know it alone bears the spring’s eternal breath,\nUnbound by yin and yang’s creative power.\n\n*Tailing Hermitage*\n\nA solitary hut nestles in cloud-wrapped hills,\nIts gate untouched by wheels or hooves, moss-spotted.\nAfter reading the *Yellow Court*, incense cools,\nDeer and apes keep me company in tranquil ease.\n\n*Ascending the Great Tower*\n\nClimbing the perilous tower, my gaze expands,\nA day’s ten thousand miles held in my palm.\nSo clear, so distant, free of dust’s veil,\nI seem to dwell idly in the Moon Palace.\n\n*Viewing the Plum Blossoms*\n\nFierce cold oppresses all things,\nYet the garden’s old jade plum stands proud.\nUnfazed by the biting wind’s force,\nIts white blooms open branch by branch in the snow.\n\n*Invited by Elder Ren of Tongyang*\n\nMy body like an untethered fishing boat,\nDrifting the vast sea at will.\nWhen inspired, I sing; when weary, I sleep,\nLetting the world’s seasons turn as they may.\n\n*Occasional Verse*\n\nBeyond form, the pivot’s subtle work,\nOn the ground of the unborn, I nurture heaven’s truth.\nForging a single luminous body,\nScattered, it becomes wind; gathered, it is spirit.\n\n*Answering Ren Erxian’s Inquiry on Daily Practice*\n\nLead and mercury refined by the hour,\nA hair’s misstep and the elixir fails.\nIf you grasp how to daily add a pearl,\nIts light embraces the void—body perfectly bright.\n\n*In Harmony with the Palace Examination, Presented to Master Wang*\n\nMountain hermitage’s traces pure, dust-free,\nCultivating the Dao’s true work, renewed each day.\nA heart at ease, unstained by anything,\nVigilant, worthy to follow the gourd-discarding sage.\n\n*Sudden Rain*\n\nClouds rise at Heaven’s Gate like ink poured,\nThunder roars, lightning flashes, rain torrential.\nFierce and towering, it scatters with the wind,\nWashing the rivers and mountains a thousand miles clean.\n\n*Mountain Dwelling*\n\nEmbracing poverty’s livelihood in deep ravines,\nApes and deer my only kin, neighbors gone.\nA censer of sandalwood incense, nothing to do,\nThree paths through the wicker gate, my breast full of spring.\n\n*Visiting a Recluse, Unmet*\n\nAmid mist and rosy clouds, I seek the immortal,\nYet in my quest for truth, truth eludes me.\nThe crane’s carriage drifts away, untraceable,\nFalling blossoms seal the spring of Wuling in vain.\n\n*West Pavilion at Yunxi Hermitage*\n\nEvening’s sunlight strikes the western pavilion,\nRevealing each thing in its completeness.\nA radiant light illumines the Dao’s eye,\nNo need to seek elsewhere for my own heaven.\n\n*In Harmony with Han Ziyu’s Excursion to East Mountain*\n\nClattering clogs climb the eastern ridge,\nSuddenly my body and mind feel cool and pure.\n\n**Sighing This Body**\n\nThis frame is firm, ever self-purifying,\nGrinding through the years where earth and heaven stretch long.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Bu Caiqing’s \"Golden Peak Abbey\"**\n\n**I**\nGolden Peak’s immortal hall faces the lone ridge,\nMan alone deeply engraves the heart of virtue and power.\nGrateful, auspicious clouds appear from time to time—\nThe Peng Palace lies plain within the eye’s reach.\n\n**II**\nMajestic Golden Peak presses upon distant peaks,\nAncient cypresses before the court pierce heaven’s heart.\nIt clearly points to the meaning of the Western Advent—\nWhy seek Cao Creek so far away?\n\n**III**\nGazing at Golden Peak’s flank, it meets green summits,\nIts ice-pure aspect pervades the human heart.\nHow many toil for fame and profit—\nWho would steal a moment’s leisure to seek this place?\n\n---\n\n**For Master Zhao**\n\nDwelling in seclusion at Clear Stream’s mouth,\nA low couch, a thin mat—ever wakeful.\nTo refine a single grain of elixir in the Mystic Palace,\nOne must rely on the crucible’s fire, three thousand strong.\n\n---\n\n**Feng Zhongxiang Asks About Cultivation**\n\nDo not cling to forms or grasp at texts,\nNor wander side-paths or crooked trails in search.\nTo know the valley of spirit and qi in emptiness—\nDrawing being from non-being is true cultivation.\n\n**II**\nSitting in dead ash, the body labors in vain,\nBlind refinement, blind practice—mind needlessly taxed.\nOne must know where the medicine’s essence originates,\nRestoring brightness, nurturing the fire to perfection.\n\n---\n\n**Further Question on Heavenly Light**\n\nActing or non-acting—both miss the mark,\nHolding fast, contemplating—all prove false.\nThe lead crucible, mercury cauldron—mechanism truly wrought,\nEssence congeals, spirit coagulates, inner radiance shines.\n\n**II**\nDragon contends with soul, tiger with spirit,\nCrow battles primordial essence, hare battles spirit.\nEmpty earth, non-action—harmony complete—\nSilently containing light, silently merging with heaven’s truth.\n\n---\n\n**Lü Hezhi Asks About Cultivation**\n\nTo begin cultivation, one must die to the yin,\nIf the yin stalk does not die, myriad entanglements assail.\nNot knowing the true message within—\nFirmly seize, firmly grasp, lest it slip away.\n\n---\n\n**On the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe Golden Elixir is drawn from non-being,\nYet do not cling to emptiness alone.\nEmptiness is true emptiness—emptiness fully realized,\nThe empty body, the embodied—all perfectly fused.\n\n**Further Question on the Elixir Method**\n\nStillness is water’s essence, wisdom is fire,\nThe heart is true mercury, the body is lead.\nWith effort, even a moment can congeal—\nTen months to gestate the embryo, to become an immortal above.\n\n---\n\n**For Master Qiao’s Request of a Banner for Wandering Souls**\n\nYellow clouds flutter, borne on a staff’s tip,\nGuiding lost souls to the azure heavens.\nSince the Jade Sound’s teaching ceased,\nThe gates of darkness scatter karma, drifting on the wind.\n\n---\n\n**For Prefect Yang of the Leather Bureau**\n\nSkillfully splitting stubborn hide with a sharp blade,\nLest it rise and gather dust.\nWrought into a body of true purity, ice and frost—\nNever cut from the same cloth as the rank and foul.\n\n---\n\n**For Abbot Wang’s Farewell, Requesting a Verse**\n\nComing in the ninth summer, pomegranates burst in flame,\nDeparting after the third autumn, chrysanthemums defy the frost.\nA heart at leisure beyond mist and water—\nAll silently guard the true constant.\n\n---\n\n**First Night of the New Year**\n\nThe Dragon Mountain’s lanterns burn like golden lotuses,\nNine streets’ towers resound with pipes and strings.\nA thousand scattered pearls dazzle the eye—\nAdorned, the nightless world becomes a flask of heaven.\n\n---\n\n**On the Woodpecker**\n\nA spirit-bird pecks within the wood,\nTalons sharp, beak keen—swiftly it works.\nNot for lack of sustenance to fill its belly,\nBut to rid the towering forest of its pests.\n\n---\n\n**Admonition on Studying the Qin**\n\nHastening in Dao-cultivation, cherishing every inch of time,\nStrumming silk and paulownia—mind laboring in vain.\nWithin yourself, the stringless melody is already complete—\nWhy seek sound only upon the fingers?\n\n---\n\n**Admonition on Go**\n\nA move in hand-talk stirs idle thoughts,\nObserving the board, life’s mechanism—black and white contend.\nIf black and white know there is no duality,\nOn the path of life and death, no need for alarm.\n\n---\n\n**Liu Xian Asks: A Hair’s Difference Prevents Elixir Formation**\n\nTen months total three myriad moments,\nIn standing, walking, sitting—maintain unbroken continuity.\nA moment’s effort equals a year’s waiting,\nSeizing three myriad years within heaven’s span.\n\n**II**\nIn each of the three marvels, moment by moment—no other way,\nWithin three myriad moments, harmony is key.\nA single moment’s deviation drains the medicine’s essence—\nBy what means then can the Golden Elixir congeal?\n\n---\n\n**Xu Xian Asks About the Method of Cultivation**\n\nWater and fire balanced, neither dry nor overflowing,\nMercury and lead refined, entering the Elixir Terrace.\nWith each day, each season, gradually congealing—\nOriginal substance, original form—gestating the sacred embryo.\n\n**Further Question on Mystic Frost**\n\nGather the qi of the sun and moon’s two wheels,\nSeize a speck of yang from heaven and earth.\nFollow the season, return to the lead-mercury crucible,\nBoil with water, refine with fire—condensing mystic frost.\n\n---\n\n**Li Daokuan Asks About Cultivation**\n\nThe body harbors true qi, the heart harbors essence,\nRefining these two yields the numinous spirit.\nIf one invests full effort with threefold resolve,\nThrough a hundred thousand kalpas, clarity will dawn.\n\n---\n\n**On Subduing Lead and Mercury**\n\nLead and mercury, when fire is applied, can flee—\nOne must rely on nameless simplicity to anchor them.\nLead enters the Kun Palace, mercury enters Qian,\nWater and fire harmonized—the elixir bears no fault.\n\n---\n\n**Left Elder Asks: The Culmination**\n\nForget form to nurture qi—qi is the root,\nForget qi to nurture spirit—spirit nurtures the true.\nEven spirit must be forgotten—emptiness then nurtured,\nNurturing emptiness to merge with the Dao—this is the culmination.\n\n---\n\n**Reminder: In Dao, Do Not Cling to Emptiness**\n\nThe Dao is not far, yet people distance themselves from it,\nPeople who embody the Dao—the Dao seeks them.\nKnow that the heart’s attainment has no empty use—\nEmptiness itself is not empty—emptiness is the true.\n\n**II**\nBusily disentangle from webs of doubt,\nThought by thought, open the gates of myriad wonders.\nSeeing through delusive conditions, free of clinging forms—\nThe heart’s mirror shines, never dimmed.\n\n**III**\nThe six dusts’ shadows are not the heart’s forms,\nExtinguishing brightness to seek emptiness is still external.\nTo know the true Dharma-body of non-emptiness,\nFirst one must clearly realize the One True Heart.\n\n---\n\n**Li Miaozhen Asks About Emptiness and Oneness**\n\nBefore and after awakening—both are not true,\nIn the very moment of dissolution, the body pervades fusion.\nSilent, thought-free—the heart abides rightly,\nSuddenly vast, as if dwelling in the great void.\n\n---\n\n**Admonition to the Assembly: On Dreams**\n\nA dream within a dream—double illusion,\nA shadow beyond a shadow—triple delusion.\nTurning and following conditions, illusions arise,\nConditioned mind ever obscures the true heart.\n\n**II**\nAll conditioned things are like dreams and phantoms,\nHow many karmic thoughts are resentful demons?\nThe conditioned’s essence is not truly real—\nIn the very moment, if not extinguished—what can you do?\n\n**III**\nDreams are empty forms, the body is a dream,\nThought by thought contending with emptiness—dreams are the same.\nDream and waking share one self,\nYet there is no self—this self is empty emptiness.\n\n---\n\n**On Transcending Creation**\n\nAmidst the swirling transformations, wholly transcended,\nVast and solitary—only standing alone.\nSpirit’s illumination, strict discipline—never forgetting,\nAbiding in the One True—without deviation.\n\n**On the Sun and Moon’s Lofty Ascent**\n\nSun and moon soar high—wondrous workings of the mechanism,\nGolden crow’s crimson glow crosses the deep pool.\nSteadfast, lodge in the osmanthus of the Moon Palace,\nGradually refined into skin white as snow.\n\n**Continuing the Subtle Inquiry on Halting Thoughts**\n\nWhen thoughts arise, swiftly awaken and halt them at once—\nLet not thoughts arise while awareness lags behind.\nIf awareness is swift and cessation is swift,\nThe wondrous Dao appears before you—realization is near.\n\n**Amidst Snow**\n\nHalfway up the mountain, the goat-path winds and coils,\nForests and peaks block the snow’s biting cold.\nLeaning on the railing, gazing from on high,\nSuddenly one feels the vastness of heaven and earth in a single gourd.\n\n**Leisure at West Creek**\n\nBeyond the gate, the creek’s sound washes jade-cold,\nPiercing the heart’s ground—serene and at ease.\nAwakened from the dream of *Huaxu*—no affairs remain,\nA bowl of pine tea, a stove of sandalwood.\n\n**Seven-Character Regulated Verse: The Grass Pavilion of Eternal Truth**\n\nA Daoist hermit builds a grass pavilion in the secluded abode,\nEarth harmonizes with thatched windows—frugal in construction.\nThe lingering bright moon adds to idle delight,\nThe beckoning clear wind quickens rustic passions.\nAuspicious mists conceal the three paths—pristine and pure,\nSunlit haze dips low, brightening the curtain’s sheen.\nAt times, gibbons and cranes come to visit,\nAs if speaking of lofty halls—not necessarily clear.\n\n**To the Recluse of West Mountain**\n\nThe recluse’s nature loathes the snail-shell fame,\nChronic illness and misty peaks quicken rustic joys.\nAcorns and sesame suffice for daily sustenance,\nThe alchemical furnace and scriptures bring delight to life.\nAt dawn, he gazes at the mountain market’s sunlit haze,\nAt night, he listens to the pines’ gibbons crying to the moon.\nAll affairs, when seen to their end, are nothing at all—\nOnly the One True Dharma Realm stands solitary and towering.\n\n**Not Many**\n\nOne nature, pure and empty—six qi in harmony,\nWind and waves still—no churning in the Chan river.\nHis livelihood hoards the yellow sprout in abundance,\nHis living spares the white snow in plenty.\nIn the field of purity, he willingly turns and turns,\nOn the realm of luminosity, he alone spreads his net.\nNow his kin are the body of emptiness,\nA single effort—this is all that is needed.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe flavor of the Dao flows on, effortless in use,\nVastly opening the profound measure—free from worldly clamor.\nTwo wheels of light shine bright on the nine heavens,\nThree isles’ winds return—four seas’ tides.\nSix delusions born of emotion all shatter like tiles,\nFour conditioned karmic laws melt like ice.\nThe heart empty, unattached—like the empty realm,\nOne nature, crystalline—transcending ten thousand ages.\n\n**Concluding *Stimulating the True*, First Volume of Spring**\n\n**To the Tune of \"Courtyard Full of Fragrance\"**\n\nA mind at leisure—one lone cloud,\nDrifting free, untethered from all ties.\nIn the nine-heavens’ pool, a surging sacred spring,\nWatering the yellow sprout, the auspicious herb,\nBreathing purity, its light veiling golden lotus.\nTrue tidings—cool winds sweep the earth,\nPiercing to the bone, ceaseless and soft.\n\nMerged into the true form,\nLofty, standing alone,\nLaughing, transcending the Chan heavens.\nLet yin and yang shift and turn,\nThe power of kalpas cannot scorch.\nEternally enduring, unbroken,\nDrawing the true One—\nThe dharma-realm rests serene.\nNo birth, no death,\nThe wondrous body of pure luminosity,\nA thousand miles—one moonlit grace.\n\n**Second Verse: To Magistrate Hou Botong, Master of Calculation**\n\nHeaven-endowed with many talents,\nMaster of all arts, measuring heaven and earth’s heights and depths.\nCounting the sun and moon’s cycles,\nDiscerning gain and loss with precision.\nMountains and valleys—he knows their vastness,\nSeas and rivers—their depths he fathoms.\nWithin the four directions,\nEvery being, every thing,\nHe perceives down to the finest hair.\n\nExpanding the path of the square-inch heart,\nSeeking the true essence,\nNine nines as his compass.\nFixing the elixir field’s subtle shifts,\nMoving above and below.\nWhen the sum of three thousand is complete,\nThrough division, eight hundred merits align.\nThe wondrous One Vehicle—\n[...] grasped,\nThe ultimate truth leaves nothing behind.\n\n**Third Verse: Admonishing the Negligent Daoist**\n\nIdly adjusting cap and robe,\nFalsely claiming purity,\nLetting the inferior horse and mad monkey run wild.\nAmid the thicket of fame and profit,\nVainly parading causes and conditions.\nDay by day, chasing waves, following currents,\nNever once stilling the limpid spiritual source.\nPitiful! Such idle posturing,\nBetraying the longing for the profound mystery.\n\nSearch your heart—\nFear not the empty passage of days and months,\nSnow weighing down your temples.\nBest to rein in emotions, gather thoughts,\nPlant wisdom in the heart’s field.\nRecognize the primal, numinous awareness,\nEver till the Dao, ceaselessly hunt virtue.\nAfter three years of effort,\nForm and spirit both perfected,\nFreely attaining the soaring crane’s ease.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Water Melody\"**\n\nMen speak of the joy of no-birth,\nDays and months harmonize in accord.\nSoaring high, the crow’s flight reveals,\nBeyond separation, dwelling in the sacred bough.\nAuspicious omens swell—elixir pearls,\nLight gleams on the silver toad’s purity,\nRevealing the moon’s fair maiden.\nGathered at the Jasper Pool’s feast,\nAgain and again, drunk on golden waves.\n\nTwo in harmony,\nSeven returns of fire,\nNinefold gold refined.\nThe immortal body complete,\nOne truth abides—defiant of all.\nGathering and scattering, who binds them in darkness?\nComing and going, I alone am awake—\nThe mystery is not so vast.\nIn the square inch of the heart,\nThe dharma-realm is wholly embraced.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"The Great River Flows East\"**\n\nLife’s greatest treasure—\nEndowed with the five agents’ true qi,\nA thousand spirits’ ancient gift.\nHead and feet round and square, mirroring heaven and earth,\nYet molded by yin and yang’s kiln.\nAutumn moon, spring blossoms,\nYesterday, today—\nAll vanish with the rosy face.\nThe road ahead treacherous,\nWhen the time comes, hands and feet helpless.\n\nCount it well—\nCast off this body,\nFine robes, high rank—\nAll but idle trinkets.\nBest to shatter the heart within,\nIn stillness harmonize dragon and tiger.\nConceive the numinous treasure,\nHeaven’s light bursting forth,\nTransforming into a vault of luminous pearls.\nExternally merging with the empty realm,\nTowering, freely striding on rosy clouds.\n\n**Second Verse**\n\nJingshan’s fine jade,\nForged by the craftsman into a vessel,\nIts form discerned by heaven and earth.\nTwo apertures open, dividing sun and moon,\nEight trigrams, nine palaces—all unfurl.\nThe square-inch heart holds the pivot,\nRevolving the true essentials,\nWood and metal in tender embrace.\nThe reclusive man finds delight,\nTurning the Qian trigram’s wheel.\n\nGently inverting the primal essence,\nRelying only on what lies before the eyes,\nIn darkness, thunder and lightning arise.\nA thousand coils, a hundred circuits—\nFollowing the old path,\nSilver threads weave in meandering flight.\nFragrant dust, rich aroma,\nFilling the belly with savor,\nThe pure body now revealed.\nLight flies like snow—\nThis time, the true face is known.\n\n**Third Verse**\n\nThe initial work—chaos,\nIn the mechanism’s turning,\nThe qi of Kan’s center.\nStealthily rising, misty vapors emerge from the earth,\nAscending, transforming into auspicious clouds.\nLightning flashes, thunder roars,\nYin and yang unite,\nBringing forth a curtain of fine rain.\nFlying over the imperial river,\nIt becomes the divine water of the jade crucible.\n\nFlowing, nine transformations birth gold,\nRefined within Li’s chamber,\nTransmuted into the yang body.\nSpirit transforms, leaving form behind,\nWielding wondrous power—\nAlone commanding heaven’s canopy, earth’s mat.\nSteadfast, soaring,\nAdapting to every circumstance,\nUnfettered, at ease.\nEmbracing fusion as one,\nSuddenly transcending birth and death.\n\n**Fourth Verse**\n\nThe Heavenly Origin Teaching manifests,\nGolden lotuses bloom in season.\nScholars, commoners, officials—all revere,\nThe pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas expound.\nThose who awaken find

bright, and clear.\nPure, untouchable,\nThe great void—one, undivided.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Water Dragon Chant\"**\n\nCareering through officialdom, heart greedy for rank,\nWhen will official duties ever end?\nStrength enough to shoot the sun,\nFame high as the clouds—\nYet what has it availed till now?\nCease talk of success in fame and merit.\nBest to retire, swiftly seek return.\nFeasting on the ancients’ lees,\nAt ease on the lake,\nSailing a small boat,\nDelighting in true flavor.\n\nAwakening to the carefree life of clouds and water,\nUnfettered, at ease, without entanglement.\nThe sky’s vastness opens the chest,\nRegulating spirit, nurturing qi,\nNo bonds, no ties.\nNature and life both in accord.\nRevealing true form,\nMerging past, present, and future.\nBehold the self-strengthening hand—\nCutting iron, severing nails,\nAbandoning worldly ties.\n\n**Second Verse: To Li Yuanfa**\n\nA ceaseless qi surges through joints and channels,\nSteaming, flowing through a hundred vessels.\nGathered in the Qian crucible,\nDragon and tiger take form,\nNature and emotion entwined.\nEssence transforms, soaring high.\nSeven returns of effort,\nNine refinements complete.\nThe great elixir refined,\nSpirit’s power revealed,\nFragrance and savor\nPermeating the body.\nRadiant, the cinnabar light gleams,\nIlluminating the spirit terrace—\nA single speck, bright as snow.\n\nEver pure, ever pristine,\nNo excess, no lack—\nPerfect clarity, radiant and translucent.\nThe true heart-moon emerges,\nShining through the cosmos,\nUtterly free of dust or speck.\nLofty as the vast emptiness,\nIts wondrous, birthless power\nStands firm through ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**Third Verse: To Yang Daokuan**\n\nRenowned for mastery in the three mysteries,\nHis brush captures the ancient forms of the Mysterious Origin.\nWith gold he traces on silk,\nMajestic and sublime,\nRevealing the original true visage.\nAdorning the sacred hall with offerings,\nHe subdues all directions—\nTerrifying the hearts of demons.\nThe teachings he expounds,\nA true wind, rich and profound,\nMoves all people to turn and follow.\nOutwardly, his demeanor commands reverence;\nInwardly, he must discern—\nAll things depart from the heart.\nThis subtle function,\nNon-doing, non-acting,\nYet within the formless, a form appears.\nResponding to change without hindrance,\nEmbracing the ten directions,\nHis profound capacity unfolds.\nIn accord with the vast void’s single point,\nA living path of emptiness,\nHis spiritual powers flourish.\n\n**Fourth Verse: The Idler’s Joy**\n\nThe idler savors the taste of zither and books,\nWhile the wandering peddler hawks his medicinal charms.\nSuddenly, he sees through\nThe folly of seeking fame,\nWasting true purpose.\nA burden before the withered tree,\nHe must cast off all inferior ties,\nDiscarding every entanglement.\nThe moon of nature, unveiled,\nShines unwavering, ever bright.\nForgetting spirit and qi,\nHe nurtures the empty body.\nRefining true wisdom, not void,\nToward the vast emptiness,\nHe becomes a vessel of divine wonder.\nIn purity and clarity,\nBoundless and expansive,\nNot a speck of dust obscures.\nPerfect enlightenment fuses the three times,\nAdorned in full majesty—\nThe Dharma-body, pure and complete.\nManifesting thusness, luminous and clear,\nAbiding in true constancy,\nThoroughly realizing the birthless principle.\n\n**Voice Slow**\n\nAt the humble gate, nurturing vastness,\nHiding jade’s brilliance,\nHe guards simplicity, forgetting schemes.\nHis hands hold heaven and earth,\nHis body sustains the myriad transformations.\nQi churns daily in the three fields,\nTurning a single channel,\nFlowing ceaselessly.\nThrough the hundred bones,\nNectar quenches thirst,\nJade liquid sates hunger.\nBathing the wondrous body of the primordial spirit,\nIn perfect accord,\nAll movement and stillness shine.\nNeither submerged nor born,\nThe empty realm’s form is flawless.\nStanding alone, alert and clear,\nDefiant of emptiness,\nIn the actuality of non-doing.\nDelighting in true essence,\nHis virtue’s wind spreads afar,\nThe banner of the Dao raised high.\n\n**Second Verse**\n\nThe mysterious pass stands vigil,\nEmbracing the One, never parting,\nKnowing the white, guarding the black, concealing the mechanism.\nFire’s movement, a pure breeze,\nLightly blows through the three passes, crossing the sea.\nTransformed fluid descends, forming the four images,\nBecoming true mercury,\nGently immersed in the flowery pond.\nAfter nine revolutions,\nThe golden body is achieved,\nThe spirit chamber radiant.\nThe perfect, luminous true form appears,\nUnified in the human realm,\nHeaven and earth’s myriad transformations wondrous.\nNeither existing nor void,\nUnstained by defilement,\nFlawless.\nAlone, he wields the illumination of emptiness and stillness,\nKnowing fundamentally\nNo thing binds him.\nThe true emptiness’s function,\nManifests the sharpness of the returning blade,\nThe wisdom-sword raised high.\n\n**Third Verse: To Wang Yanbao**\n\nShedding self and others,\nCold as ice, beyond high and low,\nHe awakens—today is yesterday’s error.\nExamining the numinous essence,\nIn vain he endured ten thousand kalpas of delusion.\nNow, encountering the great unfolding of the true wind,\nHe is chosen among immortals,\nHis name inscribed in the celestial academy.\nWith single-minded resolve,\nHe dares to cast off flesh and blood,\nDiscarding the light and the fat.\nSeeking the wondrous joy of mist and clouds,\nHe quiets all entanglements,\nFalling delusions, no more acting.\nGuarding the One True,\nWith penetrating illumination, he upholds strict discipline.\nResting in the wondrous body of primordial emptiness,\nThe spirit-light accompanies him,\nEntering and exiting as he pleases.\nAhead, the path is clear—\nSurely he will ascend the shore of awakening,\nSteadily climbing the immortal’s ladder.\n\n**Ascending the Cinnabar Sky**\n\nTrue Yang arises,\nReturning to the Gui earth,\nQi deeply settled.\nWithin the recumbent moon’s heart,\nYin and Yang are born.\nDragon and tiger transform,\nTimely mating, no need to seize.\nTogether they form the three bodies,\nThe yellow sprout grows long,\nFragrance fills the Qian crucible.\nListen—\nThe cauldron speaks.\nNature like a pearl,\nHeart like the moon,\nBreast like jade,\nBody like gold.\nManifesting the nine Yangs,\nUtterly extinguishing the faintest Yin.\nThe original true form,\nResponding to conditions, hidden or revealed,\nGhosts and spirits revere.\nEqual to the vast emptiness,\nFlawless, dustless,\nStriding across antiquity, soaring through the present.\n\n**A Sprig of Flowers**\n\nA jade pot, a golden world,\nSun and moon share their radiance.\nThe immortal lad’s livelihood,\nEnamored of the wind’s grace.\nSeeking medicine at the river’s source,\nDaily he gathers in the southwest.\nReturning to the azure sea,\nFirst condensing golden essence,\nNine transformations restore the origin—unbroken.\nPermeating the body, fragrant mists arise,\nBursting forth in great luminosity.\nThe pure body of longevity appears,\nDefiant beyond the world.\nOne may depart the realm of sound,\nEver alert—\nMovement and stillness never obscured.\nA single body contains all,\nEmbracing past and present,\nGathering and dispersing without attachment or hindrance.\n\n**Plucking the Plum Blossom: To Elder Zhang, a Good Friend**\n\nSpring departs, autumn arrives, frosting the temples.\nDays pass, months follow,\nConsuming the rosy complexion.\nLead wanes, mercury dwindles, the sea’s source dries.\nThe jade nectar exhausted,\nThe golden orchid withers.\nNurture well the three origins, seal the five passes.\nSoaring high with sun and moon,\nLight shines upon Mount Ao.\nCondensing the round treasure, cold as frost.\nBefore the eyes, thusness—\nBeyond things, at ease.\n\n**Fragrant Journey: Li, the Assembly Leader, Asks About the Dao**\n\nThe Great Dao is formless,\nForcibly given a name.\nDividing the five qi,\nIt fuses and embraces creation.\nPervading the six directions,\nIt encompasses all beings.\nFundamentally without emotion,\nWithout scent,\nWithout sound.\nThrough human awakening and diligent practice,\nTransformation is birthless.\nOne must still the heart,\nProfoundly, darkly.\nNeither void nor existing,\nThe wondrous body moves freely.\nThis true constancy,\nSoaring through past and present,\nAlone, ever alert.\n\n**Second Verse**\n\nDiligently seeking the wondrous Dao,\nFinding joy in forgetting cares.\nLet go of the snail’s fame,\nThe fly’s profit—rest the heart.\nThe six senses cease their opposition,\nA single qi, soft and focused.\nFire does not wane,\nWater does not lack,\nHarmoniously replenishing.\nThe hundred vessels flow,\nCirculating through the four seas.\nGradually, cinnabar congeals,\nPure light floats.\nThe wondrous body of emptiness,\nUnobstructed, unconfined.\nResponding without fixed direction,\nIlluminating all things,\nManifesting in every head.\n\n**Third Verse: Asking About the Gate of Cultivation**\n\nThe Dao’s body is level,\nYet the blind cannot walk it.\nSeeking its edges,\nClinging to dharma, refining skill.\nWandering strange paths,\nThey obscure the way ahead.\nI urge all people—\nRaise your eyes,\nRecognize the birthless.\n\nDeeply still, profoundly clear,\nBrewing wakeful clarity.\nUnlocking heaven’s gate,\nEarth’s door firmly sealed.\nYang ascends the hidden path,\nSoaring past the divine capital.\nPassing layered towers,\nReturning to empty earth,\nCinnabar congeals, perfected.\n\n**Fourth Verse: Mistaking the Aggregates of Suffering**\n\nMistaking the aggregates of suffering,\nThey clog the heart’s chamber.\nChasing conditions,\nDiscriminating in haste.\nBetter to gather the ten thousand realms\nWithin the palace of the mind.\nDissolve deluded traces,\nKnow all forms—\nEmbody emptiness.\nIlluminating the empty source,\nTrue emptiness in action.\nRevealing the mind’s dharma,\nMovement and stillness—bright emptiness.\nAt Kunlun’s summit,\nLeaping through the void.\nThis very emptiness—\nUntouchable,\nAll-pervading, harmonious.\n\n**Lyrics to *Jiang Shen Zi Ling***\n\nMetal conceals wood’s nature, wood conceals metal.\nThe body eludes search,\nFire arises in the crucible.\nTwo substances refined,\nGeng and Jia determine rise and fall.\nReturning to the root, restoring the origin,\nThe true body appears.\nSoul and spirit gather,\nPure, without shadow.\n\nThe message of the nine yangs arrives of itself.\nEars hum with zither tones,\nConveying pure sound.\nCalling forth the numinous,\nSurpassing ancient and modern.\nEvery realm, every void—\nNothing is not manifest,\nLucidly,\nThe dharma of this true heart.\n\n**Second Verse: A Recluse of West Mountain Visits**\n\nBy karmic affinity, we meet—\nLike a mustard seed piercing a needle.\nSpeaking of the true heart,\nDissolving the three yins.\nYang naturally ferments,\nJade nectar poured without cease.\nCompanions in drink,\nThe clinking of jade rings in the ear,\nA stringless melody—\nEchoing the zither of the wind.\n\nMysterious vapors stir the breast.\nNinefold gold,\nEven ghosts and spirits revere.\nOne with heaven’s light,\nTransformations—elusive to trace.\nEmpty as emptiness,\nYet wondrous being arises.\nThe heart radiant,\nThoughts submerged.\n\n**Third Verse: A River’s Nine Bends—Dragons and Tigers Rush**\n\nA river’s nine bends—\nDragons and tigers surge.\nIntent fierce,\nQi harmonious.\nWinding around Kunlun,\nThunder shakes heaven and earth.\nSpouting golden sands,\nLight blazing,\nMerging with the void.\n\nThe dharma-body, ethereal and vast,\nTransforming endlessly,\nNo trace of form.\nEver responsive, ever still,\nThe dharma-realm reveals perfect interpenetration.\nEncompassing all in one mind,\nForm and emptiness blend.\nNo discrimination,\nAccord with the true wind.\n\n**Fourth Verse: Once Indulging Cleverness, the Body Decays**\n\nOnce indulging cleverness,\nThe body decays.\nSeeking the mystery,\nGuarding humility.\nHeaven endures, earth abides,\nYet the will wavers, hesitant.\nThe dharma weak, the horse unruly,\nNo bridle to restrain—\nA storm of wind and flowers,\nRampant, unrestrained.\n\nFamiliar realms traversed,\nThe heart at ease.\nAdmiring terraces and pools,\nGalloping in light carriages.\nScattering harmonious qi,\nThe immortal’s path—\nSeparated by clouds and mud.\nOnce more, extend the hands that sustain heaven and earth,\nGrasp the true,\nEternally numinous.\n\n**Fifth Verse: Admiring Chrysanthemums**\n\nMountains cold, leaves of trees\nTinged with pale yellow.\nAutumn’s breath seals,\nDew congeals to frost.\nAll things return to their roots,\nYin qi ushers desolation.\nOnly the eastern fence’s yellow chrysanthemums bloom,\nSpraying icy splendor,\nExhaling pure fragrance.\n\nDistinctly round,\nManifesting the Double Ninth.\nBorn at the center,\nRadiating golden light.\nFully revealing thusness,\nDivinely wondrous, exuberant.\nFace to face, in an instant,\nAll is recognized.\nThe moon of the heart shines,\nAwareness forgets form.\n\n**Sixth Verse: To Attendant Li the Younger**\n\nWorldly affections cling like glue,\nDao-affection estranged.\nThe numinous terrace dimmed,\nVeiled in dust.\nUnfearing as mountains,\nYet the body flees, defeated.\nThe present precious form—\nUnawakened,\nThrough countless kalpas,\nA rotting, weary vessel.\n\nBetter to gather lead,\nSecure at Wudu’s steps.\nPlant the medicinal sprout,\nCongeal the spirit-embryo.\nNinefold refinement complete,\nThe lotus of the square inch blooms.\nThe body merges with pure light,\nHidden or manifest—\nFollowing the eye’s gaze,\nIt is Penglai.\n\n**Lyrics to *Jiang Mei Yin*: To Li Yuanfa**\n\nUnmoved by honor or disgrace,\nUtterly without care.\nPassing spring and autumn,\nAttaining ease.\nShattering all entanglements,\nNothing clings to the heart.\nWithin heaven, one heaven—\nA living practice.\nTaming dragons and tigers,\nFreely circling,\nThe Dipper never rests.\n\nPurple-golden frost congeals—\nThere is a reason.\nThree cycles complete,\nJade lads gather.\nThe dharma-realm, clear heaven,\nWind and moon alone respond.\nThe wondrous vessel perfected,\nWorthy of selection.\nToward the immortal’s court,\nSeizing the banner,\nFirst in the tally.\n\n**Second Verse: To Assembly Head Liu**\n\nGrain for food, silk for clothing—\nGreedily sought.\nFurrowing the brow,\nScouring for profit and fame.\nFiercely clinging to clay,\nMolding vessels, flaunting elegance.\nVainly reaching the treasure mountain,\nYet returning empty-handed.\nOnly bound to this wheel of rebirth,\nUnwilling to cease.\n\nBetter to turn the light inward,\nCultivate this body.\nRein in the horse and monkey,\nRetain mercury and lead.\nThe fiery crucible,\nTimely stoked and drawn.\nRefine the one true,\nRound and luminous treasure.\nShining through the cosmos,\nFlawlessly radiant,\nIts price beyond recompense.\n\n**Lyrics to *Mu Lan Hua Ling***\n\nWithin the two strings,\nThe true creation is concealed.\nYin and yang reverse,\nKan and Li inverted.\nThe Dipper’s qi drives into the furnace-dragon.\nRefining by the hour,\nThe medicinal forest unspent.\nExotic fragrance wafts,\nWind-borne, ethereal.\nGolden flowers bloom,\nCongealing into the round treasure.\nPure and luminous,\nNot carelessly formed.\nLike the void itself,\nGreat light fuses and illumines.\n\n**Lyrics to *Ta Suo Xing***\n\nStill and indifferent, forgetting schemes,\nSerenely nurturing simplicity.\nA hint of wonder—\nOthers scarcely discern.\nDarkly, dimly,\nThe spirit-pearl is cleansed.\nDrowsily, silently,\nThe moon of the heart unfolds.\n\nClouds of ten thousand kalpas disperse,\nOne sky, bright and clear.\nThe mouth pure, the body bright,\nLike ice and snow.\nNeither increasing nor decreasing,\nManifesting perfect completion.\nWakeful, untrammeled,\nWithout birth or extinction.\n\n**Second Verse**\n\nMovement and stillness—\nForgetting schemes.\nCleverness does not arise.\nAwakened, all worldly passions are pared away.\nThe lamp of the heart,\nTrimmed, never dim.\nWisdom-light pervades,\nVast and boundless.\n\nEver pure, ever clear,\nNeither attached nor indulgent.\nUpon the realm of the one true,\nFreely abiding.\nNeither ox nor image,\nNor person—\nStanding alone,\nSpreading true joy.\n\n**Third Verse**\n\nA single branch of *ling* wood,\nSlender as a crane’s scripture.\nFlesh light, body red—\nThe reclusive one praises it.\nIn walking, standing, sitting, lying,\nNever apart.\nPiercing clouds, crossing waters,\nEver constant.\n\nDispelling the deluded ford,\nGuiding back from crooked paths.\nAiding peril, assisting danger,\nCommuning with the divine.\nTimely stirring,\nTiger and dragon contend.\nThe tip lifts sun and moon,\nHeaven and earth gleam.\n\n**Lyrics to *Nan Ke Zi***\n\nThe body—empty as void, pure.\nThe heart—tranquil as Mount Hua.\nMyriad conditions, false thoughts—\nNo interference.\nAbiding in non-thought,\nEverywhere at ease.\n\n**The Pearl of Awakened Sea**\n\nThe pearl of the awakened sea gleams bright,\nThe moon of Chan’s sky chills the night.\nPerfect clarity—no need to polish tenfold—\nLet go, draw near,\nA single point expands earth and heaven wide.\n\n**Second Verse: To Those Who Turn from the Dao**\n\nLong still, yet thoughts stir anew,\nSweetly lost in the sea of desire’s snare.\nImmortal and mortal paths diverge like cloud and mud.\nFrom this moment parted,\nNo glance back at heaven’s ladder.\n\nDo not learn the wren’s ambition,\nEndlessly clinging to a slender branch.\nLike the leviathan of the northern sea, may your will take flight.\nIn a span, become the roc,\nPoised to soar o’er heaven’s pool.\n\n**Third Verse: Zhang Daoyi Asks of the Yellow Sprout**\n\nYang stirs, yin follows in change,\nThe yellow sprout humbly grows tall.\nFive uneven leaves unfurl in the Yellow Court,\nThe pearl-bud blooms,\nUnleashing purple-golden radiance.\n\nFirst the elixir’s grain is formed,\nPure light fills the vast cosmos.\nGracefully, it pierces the body with rosy dawn’s glow.\nWithin and without, luminous,\nThe dharmadhātu stirs in clarity.\n\n**Fourth Verse**\n\nIn sitting, lying—ever serene,\nBreath flows slow and unbroken.\nWarm, the nine qi rise in the eastern lead crucible.\nThe body’s field seethes,\nDay and night sipping nectar’s wine.\n\nThree elixirs dwell within the belly,\nNot a thing lingers in the heart.\nNurtured, the sturdy form merges with emptiness.\nIn arising and vanishing, ever wakeful,\nThe true form reveals its primordial face.\n\n**Song of the Golden Goblet**\n\nThe heart at ease,\nDelighting in forests and springs.\nIncense of sandalwood, the clay censer’s dragon-scented warmth.\nCold cups stir joy,\nSteaming tea’s mist.\n\nEmotions profound,\nA belly full and content.\nCompanions—leaping deer,\nCrying apes.\nPure, the spirit’s source,\nFire-born lotus.\n\nCool clarity shines, dispelling all dust.\nThe five eyes see bright,\nAttaining the profound mystery.\nCrimson gleams the sea,\nMoon sinks in the deep.\nPerfect clarity’s form,\nBoundless in response.\n\n**Lyrics to *Jie Pei Ling*: Lament for the Moth**\n\nThe moth’s inborn nature,\nLost in bitter realms.\nEver chasing the candle’s flower-shadow,\nIt hurls itself to death,\nScorched and seared—yet still unaware.\nAll amiss, mistaking\nThe firefly’s fleeting glow for chill beauty.\n\nDrawn to brightness with intent,\nLonging for the dark’s embrace.\nAlas, no merit in enduring hunger’s brief pang.\nOnce the fiery light is seen through,\nNo more self-immolation—\nForm and life both fade.\nAlone, it finds delight\nIn the cool, clear realm.\n\n**Cultivating the Pure Heart**\n\nA heart serene nurtures vastness—\nstar-dust stirs not.\nNear woods and springs,\nno wheel nor hoof intrudes.\nA life of quiet ease,\nwith moss encircling the gate,\na courtyard swept by winds of fallen blossoms.\n\nCranes cry in the cold dew,\napes wail beneath the bright moon.\nEach day they keep me company—\npine flowers, jade-like herbs.\nI savor effortless being,\nnever seeking beyond this form.\nAwakened to the pearl within my robe,\nhere is Penglai before my eyes.\n\n**To the Tune *Lang Tao Sha*: Let Go of Forms—All Is Empty**\n\nVainly clinging to hollow emptiness,\nmired in stubborn void.\nToiling in vain, blind to the emptiness within.\nWithin emptiness, the wondrous body blends,\nfor emptiness is not empty.\nThis truth is true emptiness—\nin every thing, emptiness shines.\nThoughts arise, yet none contend with emptiness.\nOnly when green emptiness reveals itself as deep wisdom\nis perfect emptiness fulfilled.\n\n**To the Tune *Wan Nian Chun*: Listening Within**\n\nSilent, I hear within my body\nfire-dragon and water-tiger vie in roars.\nTruly wondrous!\nWaves crash loud,\ncoiling ‘neath the canopy of heaven’s light.\nFrost-gold refines,\nthe crucible forges true creation.\nA treasure gleams—\nearth radiant, sky pristine,\na body unstirred by dust.\n\n**II**\nA life at ease,\neach day ruled by wind and moon.\nNo cares weigh the heart.\nStill, I listen to the apes’ cries,\nas if recounting the discourse of no-birth.\nUtter cool clarity—\nnot a speck of dust in sight.\nGreat luminosity,\nwithin and without resplendent,\nas if dwelling in the realm of empty space.\n\n**III**\n**Mid-Autumn**\n\nAn autumn night’s silver toad,\na sky of ten thousand leagues, light as washed.\nA gentle breeze,\nbrushing the cosmos clean,\ncrystalline, without the slightest veil.\nStarlight dims,\nrevealing the fullness of perfect clarity.\nBeneath the white canopy,\nmy spirit soars,\nclimbing the green cassia in person.\n\n**To the Tune *Wu Ling Chun*: A Warning to the Dharma-Enforcer**\n\nWords may lead one to grasp truth,\nbut truth demands forgetting words.\nOnce the fish is caught, cast the trap aside—\nclinging to the trap invites the lash.\nSeal lips, still the tongue, make no explanations,\nsilently delve the profound mystery.\nRefine qi, cultivate the heart, sever false ties—\na cold moon illumines the azure sky.\n\n**II**\n**Wang Xiaoxian Asks About Chan**\n\nThe Dharma-realm’s true heart abides in stillness,\nin its very presence, all ties dissolve.\nWithin and without, luminous body manifests—\nno earth, no heaven.\nGrasping at Chan’s form, Chan drifts farther,\nChan’s nature like the moon sinking in the deep.\nIn motion or stillness, ever serene,\nthe spirit’s function is true Chan.\n\n**To the Tune *Nan Xiang Zi*: Seven Returns to Subdue True Yin**\n\nTrue Yin submits to sevenfold return,\nguest and host reverse—strength fails.\nBeyond the three realms, the wondrous soars,\nsuddenly arriving,\npiercing earth and sky, radiant through ages.\n\nIn this very body, thoughts sink deep.\nA crane-borne heart rides the pure wind.\nFrom north or south, no hindrance—\nat will, I drink,\ntrue joy, true delight, free to chant and roar.\n\n**Gazing Toward Penglai**\n\n**The Cultivator of Truth**\n\nCultivator of truth, hold fast to yielding will—yet firm must be your resolve.\nThe golden crucible, ever filled, preserves the elixir of life;\nthe jade furnace, oft kindled, burns the incense of cavernous truth.\nMind and realm alike—all is cool and clear.\n\nProfound

resplendent.\n\n---\n\n**The Worldly Wanderer**\n\nWorldly wanderer, thought by thought, enslaved by greed and gluttony.\nLike gibbons leaping from cliffs, the heart indulges in fleeting joy;\nlike a frail steed battling the wind, the mind labors in vain.\nFamiliar realms—relentless torment.\n\nClinging to bitterness as if sweet,\nthe heart’s affairs teem like tangled hair.\nHow much better to smash the tumult of passions,\nto till the Dao in joyous ease!\nCan the path of birth and death then be escaped?\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune *Cai Sang Zi***\n\nThe wondrous Dao of emptiness—guard it with steadfast heart.\nEmptiness itself surrenders to your embrace,\ncoalescing into the embryo.\nWithin the formless, sun and moon are planted.\n\nMoment by moment, drink the wine of Kunlun’s peak,\ndrunk, recline upon the cinnabar terrace.\nCommand the Three Terraces to submit—\nin a single flash, the clouds of ten thousand kalpas part.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune *Xi Jiang Yue***\n\nA single yang stirs in the palace of Kan,\ntwin arcs of wind rise, storming the heavens.\n\n**The Three Passes transform, droplets cascade in streams,**\nthe Four Symbols’ true cinnabar begins its

luminous and clear.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune *Jian Zi Mu Lan Hua***\n\nStrife of insects—nothing true;\nsee through it, and the heart’s visage is cast off like sandals.\nChronic ills, clouds and mountains—\nmonkeys and cranes keep company, the day spent in leisure.\n\nA pot of wind and moon,\npure and luminous, illumines all.\nWithin and without, both void—\nwhere the empty heart touches, all is pervaded.\n\n---\n\n**Its Second**\n\nForgetting mechanism, seek the wondrous—\nthe myriad dharmas are empty, resolved in the heart.\nNo bounds, no edges—\na single expanse of clear light, a sky of

fruition—\nthe undifferentiated void is myself.\n\n---\n\n*End of Scroll Two of the* **Stimulating the True Collection**\n*(Originally, this lyric was mistakenly titled \"The Staff of Ling Shou.\")*\n*Scroll Three of the* **Stimulating the True Collection**\n*Composed by Liu Zhiyuan, Master of Penetrating the Mysterious, of Golden Peak Mountain*\n\n**Chapter One: The True Heart**\n\nMaster Ziyang the Perfected One states: The true heart is the ancestral seat of nature on the left, the solar *hun*; the ancestral root of life on the right, the lunar *po*. At its center dwells the Valley Spirit, the imperial chamber of the body—indeed the pivotal crucible of returning cinnabar, the fundamental gateway to the Dao. Master Chunyang calls it the sea-turtle: the essential vessel for cultivating the true. Should one refine the true beyond this, there would be no cauldron, no return—like preparing food without a vessel, expending great effort yet reaping scant merit.\n\nThis heart is not the shadow of the six dusts, nor the fleshy mass of the physical heart. Though formless, when tapped, it responds—it is the abode of spirit and qi, the true heart beyond the heart. To recognize this heart is to perceive one’s nature.\n\nMaster Ziyang says: \"The great heart must fail; the small heart must prevail\"—know this to be so. If one can reverse the body to reside within the heart, abide in samādhi’s right reception, follow the sun and the hour, and guard spirit and intent with unwavering constancy, then in refinement, the numinous body congeals, supple and strong, transforming endlessly. Like a mirror, it responds yet remains still, illuminating all without bias, returning to oneness without a trace of stagnation.\n\nIn sitting and lying, walking and standing, speaking and silence, movement and stillness—be as stable as Mount Tai, as pure as empty space, vast and unconfined, perfectly rounded. No thing can touch it, no subtlety remains obscure: this is the realization of the true heart’s function. Those who fail to recognize this heart or perceive this nature engage in blind cultivation, sitting in vain like withered ashes, and even with hoary hair, they shall not succeed. How much worse for those who study yet do not encounter the Way, or encounter it yet do not practice, or practice yet lack diligence!\n\nSome stubbornly claim they can attain the wondrous Dao without leaving their chambers—how utterly deluded!\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: Heaven Within Heaven**\n\nMaster Heshanggong states: \"Mysterious yet again mysterious\" refers to the heaven within heaven. This is not the chaotic fusion of spirit and qi, nor the illusory realm where sun and moon, the myriad forms, wind and rain, thunder and lightning appear—such visions arise from uncontrolled spirit and qi, following deluded thoughts. This is but a double layer of illusion.\n\nOnly this one heaven possesses above a gate of life and below a portal of death. It is the singular mysterious female within the body—not the heart, kidneys, or the valley passage, nor the bladder or the cinnabar field. It is the palace where sun and moon unite, the meeting ground of yin and yang, a vessel of emptiness rooted in spirit and qi.\n\nIt has no path, no boundaries; it is smaller than the smallest, yet vaster than the vast. Near, it encompasses the square inch; far, it embraces the eight wilds. When the ninefold work is accomplished here, the medicine is complete; when the three natures merge here, the elixir congeals. Here dwell the white snow and yellow sprouts, the divine water of the Flower Pool, where the embryo forms and the body is shed.\n\nHere the nine palaces and eight trigrams gather, the four images and five phases converge, mercury and lead coalesce, and the heavenly stems and earthly branches revolve. Truly, this is the heaven of mysterious creation, eternal spring without night—the treasury of divine illumination, the realm of utmost emptiness and purity.\n\nThis heaven’s blessings are realized in an instant, as easily grasped as the palm of one’s hand. Yet it remains obscured by dense yin, veiled ever deeper. It cannot be opened through clever conjecture, nor forced by clinging to texts or images. Only through the heart’s dynamic practice, with the Dao’s power firm and robust, can one bear the weight of its transmission, expand true wisdom, and attain it.\n\nAs the Perfected One Danyang once said:\n*\"Grasping the three essentials, the numinous terrace remains pure,\nYet mist-locked and smoke-shrouded, it will not open.\nOnly when Chongyang’s teachings arrive again,\nDoes the clear wind blow forth the bright moon.\"*\n\nThus, one must receive it through heart-transmission to fully comprehend it; it cannot be grasped through minor knowledge. Without this, even if the elixir congeals and the embryo forms, attaining a body of long life and the six supernatural powers, it has never been achieved.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: The True Earth**\n\nMaster Pingshu once wrote:\n*\"Tiger leaps, dragon coils—waves surge rough,\nAt the central field, the mysterious pearl is born.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"If li and kan lack wu and ji,\nThough they contain the four images, the elixir will not form.\nOnly when true earth is embraced by both,\nDo golden sands return.\"*\n\nThis clarifies that earth is the center of the five phases, the master of the three fires, governing the eight directions and rooting the nine qi—it is called the true empty earth. It is the great cauldron for planting medicine, the palace where the primordial treasure is born, gathering the light without shadow and receiving the fluids of the eight waters. It is the pure land of awakening, the realm of eternal brightness without night.\n\nAbove, it unites the sun and moon cauldron; below, it grasps the dragon and tiger furnace. It steals and refines the qi of heaven and earth, giving birth to the crystals of li and kan. Those who receive its dharma cannot fail to ascend as heavenly immortals.\n\nHave you not seen the myriad commentaries stating that lead and mercury are sown in the earth, reaped morning and night? Yet if sown too shallowly, the seed floats and does not grow; if too deeply, it rots and does not sprout—how much worse if one fails to find the true earth! Like roots and sprouts, with earth they live, without it they perish: this is the eternal principle.\n\nKnow clearly that the yellow sprout grows, the jade bud blooms, and the true creation is cultivated—all depend on this earth. The true spirit and intent are one with it. Without gathering the three primal powers and the seven returns, the mechanism of the yang spirit cannot be achieved, and transformation cannot be completed. When spirit arrives here, qi responds; when qi arrives, spirit becomes numinous. With numinosity, form manifests, appearing without limit, responding to stillness as it arises—how great is the divine function of this earth!\n\nAs the Perfected One Changchun said:\n*\"If the inch of heart can be directly embodied,\nOne shall ascend to the Great Luo for all time.\"*\nThis clarifies the true earth’s function.\n\nThose who abandon this in their practice are like lost travelers seeking home or those who mistake stones for valleys—how can they ever find life?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: Heart and Breath Interdependent**\n\nHaving attained insight and resolute determination, one must untie bonds, release burdens, restrain anger, and still desire. Of utmost importance is the interdependence of heart and breath.\n\nBreath is the method of nurturing life: it should be soft and continuous, fermenting the primordial qi, never allowing it to scatter with joy or anger. Always preserve it, warming and nourishing the primordial palace, gradually congealing its essence until it transforms into the cinnabar treasure.\n\nWhere the heart abides, the breath abides; where the breath moves, the heart moves. Using the heart as the method to gather thoughts, one should ever maintain clarity to protect the wondrous source of numinous awareness, never allowing that awareness to stir with delusive conditions. Thus shall the vast and luminous spirit be revealed, the essence ever bright and undimmed.\n\nIf one can employ both the heart and breath in tandem, what could surpass this? Surely neither can be lacking. Have you not heard: to awaken to the eternal yet fail to grasp destiny is the foremost malady in cultivation; to grasp destiny’s foundation yet remain deluded about the ancestral nature is like a mirror seeking its reflection without a precious glass?\n\nOnly when the body is free of affairs and qi does not scatter, when the heart is without contrivance and spirit is undisturbed—only then is it achieved. Yet to purify thoughts and regulate the heart, to nurture breath and sustain life, this is the interdependent method. Should one lose the central balance, it becomes the false view of contrivance; if no method is attained, no form embraced, this is the function of quiescence. Should one lose the central balance, it falls into the false sect of dull emptiness.\n\nThus, the method cannot be clung to, nor can it be discarded; it resides in the space between use and abandonment. One must awaken the universal eye, open true wisdom, embody yet not cling to form, and apply the four practices of acting, stopping, allowing, and ceasing without falling into the illness of attachment. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, the four dignified postures must not follow delusive thoughts. Free from the grasping of discriminating emotions, the heart becomes like wind in empty space—without reliance or cessation, unstained and unattached. The heart empties itself, penetrating and illuminating the One Reality, suddenly unbounded and unimpeded.\n\nThis is the essence of the two wondrous methods, the timeless practice of all ages, the foundation for ascending to the One Vehicle.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: Dying Yin to Generate Yang**\n\nThe Three Sages’ Jade Instructions state: “The world does not understand dying yin. Yang is the root of life, while yin is the root of death to yang. Simply absorb the numinous tortoise to put the yin stem to death, and spirit will naturally arise—do not mistake the death of the yin stem for the death of the Dao.”\n\nAlas! Those who cultivate the body know only to suppress desire. Little do they realize that with a single thought of the heart, qi scatters with the heart, and essence perishes with qi. Have you not heard the words of the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring: “A single thought of lust stirs, and the harmonious qi of the hundred bones is harmed”?\n\nOnly those who attain the method can put the yin stem to death as if the six desires and seven emotions vanish in the moment, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms utterly extinguished without trace, all myriad concerns suddenly stilled. Thus, the true thought of reality arises, and even in the presence of phenomena, the heart remains unmoved—like white jade cast into mud yet unstained, as steadfast as Mount Tai. The Three Passes close without residue, the Gate of Life’s key is flung wide open. The ninefold radiance transforms qi, the five metals birth misty clouds; the double-headed jade deer rears high to spit golden wind, the three-inch crimson dragon lowers to gather the liquid of wood. The medicine furnace refines mercury, the crucible and cauldron congeal frost; the body transforms into pure yang, form and spirit both wondrous. Leaping beyond the confines of heaven and earth, released from the bonds of yin and yang—this mechanism is the urgent task of cultivating the body.\n\nSome claim that without dying yin, desire instantly vanishes—such cases may exist, but I have never witnessed them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: Qi and Spirit Deviations**\n\nAfter the adept’s qi attains primordial chaos, the original qi returns to its source, overflowing and coursing through the body, causing frequent stirrings that resemble madness. Each movement occurs in eighty-one cycles, leading some to mistakenly believe in possession by another soul—this is not so. If this qi deviation is not corrected, it becomes a spirit deviation, manifesting as visions of gods and ghosts, knowledge of fortune and misfortune, causes and effects, which some mistake for divine insight and numinous clarity—this, too, is not so. If this spirit deviation is not corrected, it becomes demonic illusion, where inner deviations summon outer deviations, giving rise to myriad strange phenomena.\n\nSuch a person with such an affliction harbors the seed of calamity, the root of losing life and body, the ghostly path to ruin. Outwardly appearing correct yet inwardly false, how is this different from a sheep in tiger’s skin or one who grasps reeds while mistaking them for orchids?\n\nWhy do those of us who are gentlemen of the Dao not discern this early? If one seizes the mechanism and aligns spirit and qi correctly, refining them with the proper method, the hun and po harmonize; refining them with precise measures, spirit and essence coalesce. Gradually congealing and transforming, the numinous flesh reveals its form, condensing into the sacred embryo. Golden light fills the chamber, swirling and enveloping; the true form transmutes into pure yang, spirit dwells in the true abode, flying forth from the crown of the head. My presence becomes luminous, radiance pervades all, inner and outer shining brilliantly, merging with the Great Void without distinction. This is the true realm.\n\nThus, nature and life are both perfected, pervading and fusing without obscurity. Only then can one hear the whispers at the ear and perceive with the eye behind the head—this is the universal discourse of the mysterious gate through the ages.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Verifying the Function of the Dao**\n\nSomeone asked: “I have heard that those who cultivate in youth have strong foundations, but in old age, lead is depleted and mercury scarce. How is this?”\n\nBetween the time before parents were born and after death, where are the essence, blood, qi, and fluids? After demise, they return to earth, water, fire, and wind. In these two intervals, existence seems absent yet is present everywhere—how can one distinguish self from other, or speak of form? Why engage in false cultivation, leaving the heart ever more doubtful and unresolved?”\n\nI replied: “Excellent question. Let me tell you. Long ago, Chen Ninwu answered Yu Chan: ‘The Dao is originally formless, likened to dragon and tiger; the Dao is originally nameless, compared to lead and mercury. Taking heaven and earth as the crucible, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, through the work of seven returns and nine reversions, one refines a body of pure yang for eternal life.’\n\nThis is not attained by clinging to form or contrivance. It quietly resides in the realm of the indistinct and obscure—where is there self or other, form or appearance? Its body shines without shadow, its spirit functions freely, its nature contains myriad virtues, its function transcends a hundred errors.\n\nYet the original true neither clings nor departs. In movement, it gathers intent and enters the mysterious darkness; in stillness, it merges spirit and emerges into empty quiescence. Between movement and stillness, inner and outer radiance mutually reflect.”\n\nA body is like a crystal pagoda, illuminating earth and shining upon heaven, its radiance all-pervading and undimmed. The original nature is like a pearl in a dish, perfectly luminous, vibrantly alive, flawlessly pure. Thus manifesting the wondrous essence of the original body, its transformations flow without stagnation, names and forms do not abide—united with the Dao in truth, one realizes that what came before and what remains after all things vanish are equally empty.\n\nThis great matter of karmic affinity is the very Way of the Heavenly Immortals. Some may assent, then take their leave with these words.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Five Teachings**\nThe Great Dao is formless and without substance, utterly empty and profoundly quiescent—inaudible when listened for, invisible when gazed upon, intangible when grasped. Yet though its body bears no image, cultivation follows an ordered sequence.\n\nOne must first awaken from delusion to attain the beginning, comprehend the beginning to reach the end, achieve the end to return to sudden enlightenment, and fully realize sudden enlightenment to enter perfect completeness. From this, we know that the beginning descends from the origin into manifestation, moving from non-being into being. Next, one gathers manifestation back to the origin, returning from being into non-being. Finally, both origin and manifestation are forgotten, being and non-being are both transcended—seeing through all forms as illusory, only then does one merge with the Dao.\n\nNaturally and spontaneously, every phenomenon reveals truth, every thing becomes luminous, pervading all realms and empty space—all is the treasure of one’s own home. This is not attained by clinging to images in search of mystery or parsing texts for understanding. This radiant clarity arises from the mind’s dharma, thoroughly realized yet unobstructed, emerging from profound stillness and non-doing.\n\nIf one neglects the work of beginning and end, merely lashing the mind to force entry into principle, claiming sudden awakening without cultivation, directly pointing to the original emptiness—pure as the void—this is mere verbal comprehension while the heart remains unenlightened. Sitting in dry emptiness until death, one achieves nothing. Have you not heard: “Sudden awakening to the One Mind must be perfected through the myriad practices of complete cultivation; a moment’s enlightenment to the Dao requires the long grinding of aeons”? Alas, cultivators of the body—why not ponder these words again and again?\n\nIf one hears without depth, knows without clarity, knows without clarity, cannot exhaust its essence—then practice yields no accomplishment. Is this mere empty talk?\n\n**Chapter Nine: Forgetting Form to Nurture Qi**\nHumans, endowed with the essence of the Three Powers and formed by the Four Great Elements, cling to the self and thus experience pain and itching, craving wealth and honor, seeking comfort in dwelling and satiety in food. Daily, they cherish and protect themselves, yet in bondage, they fall into decay. To nurture the original and nourish the plain, one must clearly perceive qi—only by forgetting form can this be achieved.\n\nThe True Man of Everlasting Spring once said: “One must ultimately risk life and limb—how long can one cling to protecting face and head?” Is this not the function of forgetting form? He also said: “The heart is like an unmoving mountain; qi is like the ever-tidal sea.” Is this not the mechanism of nurturing qi?\n\nThe True Man of Cinnabar Yang said: “When the body is empty, qi circulates.” This teaching is not false. Moreover, the *Yin Fu Jue* states: “All who cultivate the body must kill the heart, embrace the One, treasure qi, and refine essence.” Clearly knowing that the qi within the body must not scatter, the practitioner should dull the senses and break the body, becoming like withered wood. The Gate of Heaven opens wide, the Earthly Door is firmly sealed. With right mindfulness present, all myriad thoughts vanish. Breathing is soft and continuous, as if existing, as if not. Gathering and refining the harmonious qi, one opens the cave of dragon and tiger, connecting with the true qi of the Great One’s primordial palace. Day and night, yin and yang ascend and descend without cease; water and fire are drawn and replenished without error, warming the lead crucible with gentle, unbroken heat.\n\nCultivating the true fire, one does not transgress the three barriers or the hundred transformations—this is what “gentle and unbroken” means. Those who dwell in the upper heavens—are these empty words? When the Sea of Qi is purified, evil cannot invade. Always like a hen brooding her eggs, like a deer nurturing its antlers, one eternally guards the One qi to return to the root, attaining the Dao of preserving life and achieving immortality. Those who rode the carp into the water and rode the carp out—was this not achieved by forgetting form?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Forgetting Qi to Nurture Spirit**\nFor those who advance in cultivation: when principle is attained with perfect balance, fire does not burn dry, water does not overflow. The two are harmonized according to measure, and the One qi is subdued in the furnace without escape. The Golden Elixir is refined and returned to congeal the true—how can one cling to it without forgetting?\n\nIf one does not forget, it is like crossing a river and not abandoning the boat—difficult to reach the other shore; or like recovering from illness yet continuing to take medicine—harming the upright qi. Master Ping Shu said: “Do not use ordinary lead; having used true lead, discard it.” This is the true esoteric method of using lead. “Use lead yet do not cling to it”—these are sincere words.\n\nThus, when the work of nurturing spirit is urgent, one must settle into stillness and forget qi. When the heart does not generate activity, principle does not kill spirit. This undying spirit is not the spirit of thoughts, intentions, or deliberations—it is one root with heaven and earth, one body with the myriad things. Nurturing it with subtle mechanism, the body seems as if not there. The sun and moon mutually illuminate, inner celestial light shines forth—appearing like a luminous pearl, resembling the full moon. Illuminating inner vision, day and night are distinct, transforming into a treasury of spiritual powers.\n\nThus, spirit is offered to spirit, and spirit becomes numinous—like a crane riding the wind, its comings and goings unfathomable. Do not mistake this for mere marvel; one must return to nurturing the empty valley, steadfast as an unmoving mountain. Suddenly, one day, a transformed body is born—sending forth and gathering in are at one’s command. This is the full attainment of the Way of nurturing spirit.\n\nHave you not heard the words of the True Man Zhang in *The Song of Unfastening the Jade Pendant*:\n“The yang spirit leaves the body, dark and profound.\nIn an instant, it roams the Three Isles.\nOnce entry and exit are mastered, restrain it—\nseek further mystery.\nMerge with true emptiness, and the Great Void is complete.”\nTruly, these are the words!\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Forgetting Spirit to Nurture Emptiness**\nThose who have attained the method of refining spirit guard the spirit in the mysterious palace, pure and undefiled, yet cannot yet merge with emptiness and transform. One must forget this spirit to nurture emptiness. Thus, one neither abides in non-doing nor exhausts doing—neither clings to the already-extinguished extinction nor gives rise to the not-yet-moved movement.\n\nAt this juncture of cessation and continuation, when the mind abides in stillness without thought, one pierces through the emptiness of all dharmas and the unreality of all appearances. Each delusive condition dissolves upon encounter, and all defilements naturally cease. There is no abiding in abiding, no thought in thought—obscurely, it seems to act without acting, serenely, it merges emptiness with emptiness. The substance of this emptiness suddenly becomes unbound.\n\nShould one fail to grasp the transformations of nurturing from beginning to end: if nurtured above, it scorches the eyes and reddens the face, losing the refinement of the true heart. If nurtured below, it sinks into the elixir field, merely sustaining the path of grains. If nurtured externally, one chases shadows and squanders golden sand. If nurtured internally, one adorns the heart’s subtleties, constricting without universality. Thus, each clings to one aspect, fostering delusion in turn, contending over this and that, gain and loss, unable to free themselves—unworthy of discussion.\n\nThe supreme subtlety lies in realizing the nurturing of qi and spirit to attain inner vision. Within, one perceives the emptiness of body and mind; without, the emptiness of all things. In all matters of seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing, one does not cling to appearances, attaining utmost purity and great clarity. Thus, one recognizes it face-to-face, abides in tranquility with mastery, and gradually merges with the Great Void. Within, one embraces the radiance of sun and moon; without, one blends with the bounds of emptiness. Without premeditating the mind in the Great Void, one naturally unites with it, free from the slightest obstruction or the faintest stain. Internally and externally, above and below, no distinctions arise—only a serene, unmoving effort, pure and forged into oneness.\n\nAt this point, heaven is not heaven, earth is not earth, and one knows not where the self resides. Gathered, it forms shape; dispersed, it becomes qi—lucid and unbound, standing solitary and transcendent. This is called shattering emptiness to attain completion.\n\nYet words cannot exhaust meaning, nor meaning exhaust words—transcending both, it is transmitted beyond teaching, beyond the written line.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Fusion Without Attachment**\nIt is said: Only because the eye does not see itself can it see objects; only because a mirror does not illuminate itself can it reflect objects. If it were to see or illuminate itself, it would be too occupied to attend to others. The marvel of vision and reflection lies in their focus elsewhere, thus reversing light upon objects, making all things radiant and flawless—dust becomes earth, a drop becomes the sea. One realizes the non-duality of principle and phenomena, the unity of movement and stillness.\n\nThus, the inner mind does not arise, knowing external realms are fundamentally empty. One naturally follows conditions without clinging to distinctions, freeing the heart from obstructions. Like gold refined a hundred times, impurities vanish and brilliance emerges—evidencing the precision of Dao-power, the cleansing of the mind’s profound vision. External dust is instantly relinquished; one sees the emptiness of all appearances, delusive conditions do not arise. In the perfect clarity of true reality, not a single thing remains, nor any suffering aggregates to obstruct. All realms are gathered into one mind.\n\nHaving merged appearances with essence to return to the source, one manifests true realms from the original mind, revealing the wondrous existence of the formless. Establishing methods to respond to change, one deploys the power of concentration and wisdom, manifesting various expedient means to cultivate the right knowledge of myriad practices, revealing the pure true nature like empty space. Empty and formless, what thing could obstruct it?\n\nThus, the profound measure enters the microcosm without being small, encompasses the Great Void without being large. Only this mind and this realm, secretly fused and perfectly merged, utterly transcending traces—this is the true emptiness of the essential Dharma-realm.\n\nIf one does not establish merit, the mind and realm remain obscured, unable to simultaneously dissolve form and emptiness, yet falsely claiming to fuse the ten thousand things without attachment—how deluded!\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: No Cultivation, No Attainment**\nThere are those of the Lesser Vehicle who cling to emptiness and fixate on annihilation, leaving nature without refuge and dharma without rectification. Fearing form as an obstacle, they extinguish form to reveal emptiness, or separate from form to reveal emptiness. Seeing all appearances as illusory, nothing worthy of embrace, they fail to perceive the creative emptiness within, the wondrous existence of emptiness—though not governing, it mysteriously coalesces within emptiness. How unlike the illusory flowers in the sky or the mirage’s semblance of existence, which are not truly present.\n\nThey claim sudden awakening to no-cultivation, yet do not understand the cultivation within no-cultivation, the seeking within non-seeking. How do they differ from the ignorant, who fundamentally neither cultivate nor seek? Like beasts of burden, merely refraining from active thought—can this be called emptiness?\n\nTruly, without entering the vast sea, one cannot obtain the wish-fulfilling pearl. Without cultivating the practices of wisdom and expedient means, one cannot adorn the Dharma-body. Without seeking the original true luminous essence, one cannot perfect the Dharma-nature.\n\nOnce delusive thoughts suddenly cease, the original true essence becomes manifest—there is no other truth to seek; this is the seeking within non-seeking. The Dharma-body being complete, it responds to conditions as they arise—there is no other true essence to cultivate; this is the cultivation within no-cultivation.\n\nThus, neither delusion nor truth—what is there to cultivate, what to attain? The numinous awareness is fundamentally without a single thing; why cling to the toils of life? The body remains as unmoving as Mount Tai, the mind as unobstructed as empty space—revealing the wondrous essence, radiant and free from all names and forms. Seeing the emptiness of all things, where is there cultivation or attainment?\n\n**Biographical Account**\nMaster Liu Zhiyuan of Tongxuan, a native of Gaolouli in Xici, was a disciple of Chaoranzi. For twenty years under his teacher’s guidance, his demeanor showed neither joy nor anger. Thereafter, like the wind swaying grass, countless scholars and commoners sought to serve him as their master.\n\nMaster in his daily life slept without startling dreams, walked without heeding the path, sat like withered wood, and dwelled as an unfeeling stone—ever silent, his mind never entangled with things. When visitors came to call, before the conversation had run its course, he would appear as if in a stupor, his mouth unresponsive to questions, his gaze not meeting their eyes. Yet those who parted from him gained some wondrous insight or direction. Had the power of the Dao not long been etched into his heart, how could he have reached such a state?\n\nWhatever he coughed or spat forth became as resplendent as strings of pearls or the jades of Zhao, and his brushstrokes flowed like the sap of oak—without need for labored search, he composed a collection, which he titled *Awakening the Real*.\n\nAt the age of fifty-nine, on the nineteenth day of the seventh month, he departed by *shijie*. He left behind a gatha:\n\nA moving corpse on earth, chasing wind and dust,\nNurtured thusness to realize the original real.\nScooping earth to embrace heaven—no form remains,\nYet body fully revealed across the ten directions and three realms.\n\nWhen his funeral procession set forth, wind and rain escorted it for over thirty *li*. Yet near the spirit casket, the wind left the banners still, and rain did not dampen the mourners’ clothes. Auspicious vapors merged with the rainbow, and rare fragrance wafted like musk. All who attended the burial were struck with awe. With one voice, they marveled, saying: \"This is truly the response of his Dao cultivation!\" How truly magnificent.\n\n—Dong Yongchong, *Ancient Melodies*\n\nThe dragon, ah, the dragon returns to the sea palace.\nThe phoenix, ah, the phoenix soars through the cinnabar skies.\nAlas! The true man who has penetrated the mysteries—\nHis belly ample, his marrow rich with the finest essence.\nTo learn the Dao and attain the Dao—how profound!\nTo cultivate the real and realize the real—how wondrous!\n\n—Zhang Guobao, *Six-Character Verse*\n\nNurturing azure locks and a numinous frame,\nHe shed his immortal bones, graceful and refined.\nWherever he roamed, he stood majestic and grand,\nWith perfect clarity, mastering the wondrous art of non-arising.\n\n—Qu Chan’gong, *Following the Rhyme of the Previous Gatha*\n\nThe numinous true one shed his shell and left the mortal dust,\nWisdom merged with perfect clarity, the Dao united with the real.\nIn the realm of form, he could not be found,\nYet in the formless realm, his full body was revealed.\n\n—Wang of Xishan’s *Stone Records*\n\nMy teacher, Uncle Bo, shed his shell like a cicada,\nNone who heard did not raise their hands to their foreheads in awe.\nA single thunderclap shook the earth,\nLeaving immortal traces for ten thousand ages.\nUnfettered, he scorned the wind’s purity,\nCarefree, he rode the moon’s whiteness.\nHis great name is recorded among men,\nWhile he dwells as a true guest beyond the heavens.\n\n—*Seven-Character Impromptu Verse*\n\nThe Master spoke of reaching sixty, then suddenly left his bones,\nAscending into the formless, never to come or go.\nHis immortal ascent was surely among the first ranks,\nAs Penglai’s heights trembled with a single thunderclap.\n\n—*Another Verse*\n\nThe immortal’s merit complete, he cast off the world’s cage,\nRiding the wind, ethereal, leaving no trace.\nHu Mountain remains as before—where is the man?\nOnly a shimmer of waves bathes the emerald peaks.\n\n—*The Lower Scroll of the Qizhen Collection Concludes*",

      "translated_text": "**The *Qizhen Collection***\n\n**Title:** *Qizhen Collection* (*Collection for Awakening the True*). Composed by Liu Zhiyuan of the Yuan dynasty. Three juan.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Qizhen Collection* of Master Tongxuan of Mount Jinfeng**\n\nI humbly consider: to rightly order spring, summer, autumn, and winter, one must have a pointer to make them known; to fathom the subtle, wondrous, and all-pervading, one must rely on words to awaken understanding. Yet words are but shadows of the mind’s perceptions, and written characters are shadows of words. Thought is the mind’s shadow, speech the mind’s echo—neither possesses a true substance. Yet through them, principle may be exhausted, the subtlest mysteries dissolved, all errors obliterated, and not a single dharma clung to. What use, then, are words?\n\nYet if principle is not inscribed in words, it would be like fish without a trap—none would seek it—or like hares without snares—none could be caught. Generally speaking, words are the traps and snares for fish and hares, sufficient to record the essentials of the supreme Dao, to guide and govern the mechanisms of immortality. How could they be discarded?\n\nThus, the sages composed and expounded the *Yinfu* and the *Daode*, unfolding the essence of the wondrous origin. The worthies, emulating the sages, wrote books such as the *Chongxu* and the *Nanhua* sutras, striving to enlighten later awakened ones, leading them to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. How could they not employ words to do so?\n\nMoreover, in recent times, the Five True Lineages have branched into many schools, teachings flourishing in all directions. Qiu and Liu authored the *Panxi* and *Xianle* collections; Tan and Ma titled their works *Jinyu* and *Shuiyun*. Without exception, they all drummed and sang the winds of the mysterious, illuminating wisdom and insight like the bright moon in a frosty sky, universally reflected in a thousand pools. They enabled those who savor the Dao to chew its rich marrow, to recognize the right path and avoid the pitfalls of delusion. Was this not achieved through words clarifying principle?\n\nLater, those who grasped the dragon’s scales or clung to the phoenix’s wings, who expounded the Dao and bequeathed teachings to rescue the drowning and guide the lost—I have witnessed this in Master Tongxuan. The Master’s surname was Liu, his given name Zhiyuan, a native of Gaolou Village in Xici. Born with compassion and empathy, he cherished the ancestral teachings from childhood, delving deeply into the great vehicle’s canonical texts. In adulthood, he encountered the flourishing of the Dao’s fortune, when the multitude of teachings were released from vulgarity. He met Master Chaoran, who transmitted to him the principles of nurturing the true, preserving simplicity, seeing nature, and recognizing the mind—all rooted in non-action.\n\nThereupon, he abandoned what the masses loved and gathered what they discarded. With resolve, he directly entered the profound mystery, stepping through the gate of a myriad wonders. With one taste, the three observations became empty and pure; with a second, all eight directions turned crystalline. Manifesting transformation bodies in countless forms, he traversed the single path of life and death. The celestial mechanisms and wondrous Dao were already imprinted in his heart. Thus, every utterance and written word from his brush may be likened to strings of pearls and strands of jade, not carved or engraved but naturally transcending all contrived search and arrangement. Truly, this is a compass for learners, worthy of the finest calligraphers.\n\nThough but a single phrase or a lone character, his aim was to pry open the blind and rouse the deaf, enabling them to receive and apply the teachings—not merely to cultivate himself. Yet before his literary legacy could fully flourish, he suddenly departed the world. Having penetrated the six realms with unwavering certainty, he shattered the muddy pellet (of the brain) and ascended formlessly. His writings, though extant, remained obscure and little known.\n\nHis disciple, Li Zhiquan of Pingshui, fearing they would fade into oblivion over time, traveled extensively through Jin and Bing provinces. He gathered fragments from friends who recited them from memory and obtained eight or nine parts out of ten from the records of Liu Zhijian. Thus, he collected the remnants, assembled them into a single compilation, arranged them by category, and divided them into three scrolls, titling them *Qizhen* (*Awakening the True*).\n\nHe showed them to me, seeking my review, and repeatedly urged me to write a preface, hoping to have them published and widely disseminated. Upon repeated perusal, I found the text and principles clearly laid out like a go board, the wondrous insights scattered like stars. They can guide those wandering in the dark alleys into the great radiance of the pure and luminous realm. How could one who is not a luminous pearl of the mind, transcending heaven and earth, achieve such a feat?\n\nThough I am a descendant of the Dao’s lineage, my attainment of the Dao is but faint and indistinct. My talent is as light as a cicada’s wing, my words as shallow as a frog’s croak. How dare I strike the cloth drum before the Thunder Gate? Yet, compelled by his insistence and unable to refuse, I have roughly sketched a fraction of the Master’s literary brilliance and exemplary conduct with these humble words.\n\nWritten on the twenty-second day of the latter part of the fourth lunar month in the year of *jiachen* (1244). Inscribed at the beginning of the scroll.\n\nBy Dong Shiyan, the Elder of Fengyuan of Tongyangjinli.\n\n---\n\n**Qizhen Collection, Volume One**\nComposed by Liu Zhiyuan, Master Tongxuan of Mount Jinfeng\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n*In Response to Wang Anren’s Inquiry on Daily Practice*",

intoxication,\nMystic trance roams the land of endless night.\n\n*In harmony with Qi Ziming’s rhyme*\n\nShaking off dust from my lapels, I delight in the Dao’s realm,\nClapping my breast, I recall the moonlit homeland of old.\nA flask of spring’s hue in the realm of clarity,\nSelf and world vanish—both forgotten in ease.\n\n*Following Fan Qingshu’s rhyme*\n\nDeep in woods and springs, I recall the immortal’s abode,\nStealing moments to tend the moon’s radiance.\nLoving the Silver River’s wind and waves so still,\nI drift on rosy wings, sailing the magic raft.\n\n*Dongxi Zhao the Master’s tea offering*\n\nA jade bowl of sacred water, stirred with cinnabar,\nSkillful hands brew auspicious snowflake blooms.\nLong ago, Lu Tong savored its taste,\nNow I fully grasp it as the Yellow

sashes.\n\n*Again*\n\nDwelling in seclusion, joy unburdened by comfort,\nAlone amidst mist and emerald skies.\nNow standing, now walking, worldly cares dissolve,\nHalf singing, half dancing, a few smiles arise.\n\n*For Master Li*\n\nA line heard by the ear demands effort,\nOn the tongue, great vessels are hard to forge.\nTimed firing completes the seven-sevens,\nFlesh and bone fuse—even spirits gasp.\n\n*In harmony with Jianxuan’s rhyme*\n\nThe secluded chamber’s mirror outshines the Moon Palace,\nIlluminating all within as emptiness.\nManifesting everywhere, unburdened by things,\nLight shines inside and out—body perfectly whole.\n\n*Again in the same rhyme*\n\nThe empty chamber’s mirror, pure and still,\nNever permits the world to grind its sheen.\nIts light embraces all forms, ever responsive,\nImpartial in its work, never clinging to others.\n\n*On the Brush*\n\nStrong-boned, light-bodied, its tip sharp as a needle,\nObeying the hand’s ink, its nature unrestrained.\nBranches

moon’s shadow chills like ice,\nIts radiance pierces the golden sky, boundless.\nI see the true form of perfect clarity,\nNo need to point a finger to see.\n\n*Resting at Pine Pavilion*\n\nStraw sandals, bamboo staff, I rest in the thatched hut,\nFacing the pine pavilion, vast as the void.\nWind stilled, mist cold, the sky endless,\nI seem to wander the old land of Hua Xu.\n\n*Hearing the Zither at Pine Pavilion*\n\nPine Pavilion stirs to shed worldly dust,\nThree strains of the jade zither, one wisp of incense.\nMurmuring winds, rustling strings,\nNo need for misty isles to hear immortal tunes.\n\n*Following Cai Qing’s Rhyme*\n\nWithin heaven, another heaven unfolds,\nExpanding the power of creation within.\nEmbodied in the Great Void, without form,\nIt manifests as solitary perfection in all ten directions.\n\n*Admonishing the Assembly*\n\nThe Dao embraces earth and the three heavens,\nDo not cling to the mindless—merge with nature.\nWhen practice aligns with Heaven’s timing,\nOnly then does the pearl of nature shine round.\n\n*The Moon of Nature*\n\nNot a wisp of cloud veils the frosty sky,\nThe moon of nature hangs, supremely bright.\nResponsive across the three realms and ten directions,\nA thousand pools reflect its perfect roundness at once.\n\n*Jin River*\n\nThe Jin’s waters flow cold, unafraid of chill,\nWarm as if boiling, spraying mist and cloud.\nI know it alone bears the spring’s eternal breath,\nUnbound by yin and yang’s creative power.\n\n*Tailing Hermitage*\n\nA solitary hut nestles in cloud-wrapped hills,\nIts gate untouched by wheels or hooves, moss-spotted.\nAfter reading the *Yellow Court*, incense cools,\nDeer and apes keep me company in tranquil ease.\n\n*Ascending the Great Tower*\n\nClimbing the perilous tower, my gaze expands,\nA day’s ten thousand miles held in my palm.\nSo clear, so distant, free of dust’s veil,\nI seem to dwell idly in the Moon Palace.\n\n*Viewing the Plum Blossoms*\n\nFierce cold oppresses all things,\nYet the garden’s old jade plum stands proud.\nUnfazed by the biting wind’s force,\nIts white blooms open branch by branch in the snow.\n\n*Invited by Elder Ren of Tongyang*\n\nMy body like an untethered fishing boat,\nDrifting the vast sea at will.\nWhen inspired, I sing; when weary, I sleep,\nLetting the world’s seasons turn as they may.\n\n*Occasional Verse*\n\nBeyond form, the pivot’s subtle work,\nOn the ground of the unborn, I nurture heaven’s truth.\nForging a single luminous body,\nScattered, it becomes wind; gathered, it is spirit.\n\n*Answering Ren Erxian’s Inquiry on Daily Practice*\n\nLead and mercury refined by the hour,\nA hair’s misstep and the elixir fails.\nIf you grasp how to daily add a pearl,\nIts light embraces the void—body perfectly bright.\n\n*In Harmony with the Palace Examination, Presented to Master Wang*\n\nMountain hermitage’s traces pure, dust-free,\nCultivating the Dao’s true work, renewed each day.\nA heart at ease, unstained by anything,\nVigilant, worthy to follow the gourd-discarding sage.\n\n*Sudden Rain*\n\nClouds rise at Heaven’s Gate like ink poured,\nThunder roars, lightning flashes, rain torrential.\nFierce and towering, it scatters with the wind,\nWashing the rivers and mountains a thousand miles clean.\n\n*Mountain Dwelling*\n\nEmbracing poverty’s livelihood in deep ravines,\nApes and deer my only kin, neighbors gone.\nA censer of sandalwood incense, nothing to do,\nThree paths through the wicker gate, my breast full of spring.\n\n*Visiting a Recluse, Unmet*\n\nAmid mist and rosy clouds, I seek the immortal,\nYet in my quest for truth, truth eludes me.\nThe crane’s carriage drifts away, untraceable,\nFalling blossoms seal the spring of Wuling in vain.\n\n*West Pavilion at Yunxi Hermitage*\n\nEvening’s sunlight strikes the western pavilion,\nRevealing each thing in its completeness.\nA radiant light illumines the Dao’s eye,\nNo need to seek elsewhere for my own heaven.\n\n*In

body labors in vain,\nBlind refinement, blind practice—mind needlessly taxed.\nOne must know where the medicine’s essence originates,\nRestoring brightness, nurturing the fire to perfection.\n\n---\n\n**Further Question on Heavenly Light**\n\nActing or non-acting—both miss the mark,\nHolding fast, contemplating—all prove false.\nThe lead crucible, mercury cauldron—mechanism truly wrought,\nEssence congeals, spirit coagulates, inner radiance shines.\n\n**II**\nDragon contends with soul, tiger with spirit,\nCrow battles primordial essence, hare battles spirit.\nEmpty earth, non-action—harmony complete—\nSilently containing light, silently merging with heaven’s truth.\n\n---\n\n**Lü Hezhi Asks About Cultivation**\n\nTo begin cultivation, one must die to the yin,\nIf the yin stalk does not die, myriad entanglements assail.\nNot knowing the true message within—\nFirmly seize, firmly grasp, lest it slip away.\n\n---\n\n**On the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe Golden Elixir is drawn from non-being,\nYet do not cling to emptiness alone.\nEmptiness is true emptiness—emptiness fully realized,\nThe empty body, the embodied—all perfectly fused.\n\n**Further Question on the Elixir Method**\n\nStillness is water’s essence, wisdom is fire,\nThe heart is true mercury, the body is lead.\nWith effort, even a moment can congeal—\nTen months to gestate the embryo, to become an immortal above.\n\n---\n\n**For Master Qiao’s Request of a Banner for Wandering Souls**\n\nYellow clouds flutter, borne on a staff’s tip,\nGuiding lost souls to the azure heavens.\nSince the Jade Sound’s teaching ceased,\nThe gates of darkness scatter karma, drifting on the wind.\n\n---\n\n**For Prefect Yang of the Leather Bureau**\n\nSkillfully splitting stubborn hide with a sharp

lack of sustenance to fill its belly,\nBut to rid the towering forest of its pests.\n\n---\n\n**Admonition on Studying the Qin**\n\nHastening in Dao-cultivation, cherishing every inch of time,\nStrumming silk and paulownia—mind laboring in vain.\nWithin yourself, the stringless melody is already complete—\nWhy seek sound only upon the fingers?\n\n---\n\n**Admonition on Go**\n\nA move in hand-talk stirs idle thoughts,\nObserving the board, life’s mechanism—black and white contend.\nIf black and white know there is no duality,\nOn the path of life and death, no need for alarm.\n\n---\n\n**Liu Xian Asks: A Hair’s Difference Prevents Elixir Formation**\n\nTen months total three myriad moments,\nIn standing, walking, sitting—maintain unbroken continuity.\nA moment’s effort equals a year’s waiting,\nSeizing three myriad years within heaven’s span.\n\n**II**\nIn each of the three marvels, moment by moment—no other way,\nWithin three myriad moments, harmony is key.\nA single moment’s deviation drains the medicine’s essence—\nBy what means then can the Golden Elixir congeal?\n\n---\n\n**Xu Xian Asks About the Method of Cultivation**\n\nWater and fire balanced, neither dry nor overflowing,\nMercury and lead refined, entering the Elixir Terrace.\nWith each day, each season, gradually congealing—\nOriginal substance, original form—gestating the sacred embryo.\n\n**Further Question on Mystic Frost**\n\nGather the qi of the sun and moon’s two wheels,\nSeize a speck of yang from heaven and earth.\nFollow the season, return to the lead-mercury crucible,\nBoil with water, refine with fire—condensing mystic frost.\n\n---\n\n**Li Daokuan Asks About Cultivation**\n\nThe body harbors true qi, the heart harbors essence,\nRefining these two yields the numinous spirit.\nIf one invests full effort with threefold resolve,\nThrough a hundred thousand kalpas, clarity will dawn.\n\n---\n\n**On Subduing Lead and Mercury**\n\nLead and mercury, when fire is applied, can flee—\nOne must rely on nameless simplicity to anchor them.\nLead enters the Kun Palace, mercury enters Qian,\nWater and fire harmonized—the elixir bears no fault.\n\n---\n\n**Left Elder Asks: The Culmination**\n\nForget form to nurture qi—qi is the root,\nForget qi to nurture spirit—spirit nurtures the true.\nEven spirit must be forgotten—emptiness then nurtured,\nNurturing emptiness to merge with the Dao—this is the culmination.\n\n---\n\n**Reminder: In Dao, Do Not Cling to Emptiness**\n\nThe Dao is not far, yet people distance themselves from it,\nPeople who embody the Dao—the Dao seeks them.\nKnow that the heart’s attainment has no empty use—\nEmptiness itself is not empty—emptiness is the true.\n\n**II**\nBusily disentangle from webs of doubt,\nThought by thought, open the gates of myriad wonders.\nSeeing through delusive conditions, free of clinging forms—\nThe heart’s mirror shines, never dimmed.\n\n**III**\nThe six dusts’ shadows are not the heart’s forms,\nExtinguishing brightness to seek emptiness is still external.\nTo know the true Dharma-body of non-emptiness,\nFirst one must clearly realize the One True Heart.\n\n---\n\n**Li Miaozhen Asks About Emptiness and Oneness**\n\nBefore and after awakening—both are not true,\nIn the very moment of dissolution, the body pervades fusion.\nSilent, thought-free—the heart abides rightly,\nSuddenly vast, as if dwelling in the great void.\n\n---\n\n**Admonition to the Assembly: On Dreams**\n\nA dream within a dream—double illusion,\nA shadow beyond a shadow—triple delusion.\nTurning and following conditions, illusions arise,\nConditioned mind ever obscures the true heart.\n\n**II**\nAll conditioned things are like dreams and phantoms,\nHow many

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One: The True Heart**\n\nMaster Ziyang the Perfected One states: The true heart is the ancestral seat of nature on the left, the solar *hun*; the ancestral root of life on the right, the lunar *po*. At its center dwells the Valley Spirit, the imperial chamber of the body—indeed the pivotal crucible of returning cinnabar, the fundamental gateway to the Dao. Master Chunyang calls it the sea-turtle: the essential vessel for cultivating the true. Should one refine the true beyond this, there would be no cauldron, no return—like preparing food without a vessel, expending great effort yet reaping scant merit.\n\nThis heart is not the shadow of the six dusts, nor the fleshy mass of the physical heart. Though formless, when tapped, it responds—it is the abode of spirit and qi, the true heart beyond the heart. To recognize this heart is to perceive one’s nature.\n\nMaster Ziyang says: \"The great heart must fail; the small heart must prevail\"—know this to be so. If one can reverse the body to reside within the heart, abide in samādhi’s right reception, follow the sun and the hour, and guard spirit and intent with unwavering constancy, then in refinement, the numinous body congeals, supple and strong, transforming endlessly. Like a mirror, it responds yet remains still, illuminating all without bias, returning to oneness without a trace of stagnation.\n\nIn sitting and lying, walking and standing, speaking and silence, movement and stillness—be as stable as Mount Tai, as pure as empty space, vast and unconfined, perfectly rounded. No thing can touch it, no subtlety remains obscure: this is the realization of the true heart’s function. Those who fail to recognize this heart or perceive this nature engage in blind cultivation, sitting in vain like withered ashes, and even with hoary hair, they shall not succeed. How much worse for those who study yet do not encounter the Way, or encounter it yet do not practice, or practice yet lack diligence!\n\nSome stubbornly claim they can attain the wondrous Dao without leaving their chambers—how utterly deluded!\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: Heaven Within Heaven**\n\nMaster Heshanggong states: \"Mysterious yet again mysterious\" refers to the heaven within heaven. This is not the chaotic fusion of spirit and qi, nor the illusory realm where sun and moon, the myriad forms, wind and rain, thunder and lightning appear—such visions arise from uncontrolled spirit and qi, following deluded thoughts. This is but a double layer of illusion.\n\nOnly this one heaven possesses above a gate of life and below a portal of death. It is the singular mysterious female within the body—not the heart, kidneys, or the valley passage, nor the bladder or the cinnabar field. It is the palace where sun and moon unite, the meeting ground of yin and yang, a vessel of emptiness rooted in spirit and qi.\n\nIt has no path, no boundaries; it is smaller than the smallest, yet vaster than the vast. Near, it encompasses the square inch; far, it embraces the eight wilds. When the ninefold work is accomplished here, the medicine is complete; when the three natures merge here, the elixir congeals. Here dwell the white snow and yellow sprouts, the divine water of the Flower Pool, where the embryo forms and the body is shed.\n\nHere the nine palaces and eight trigrams gather, the four images and five phases converge, mercury and lead coalesce, and the heavenly stems and earthly branches revolve. Truly, this is the heaven of mysterious creation, eternal spring without night—the treasury of divine illumination, the realm of utmost emptiness and purity.\n\nThis heaven’s blessings are realized in an instant, as easily grasped as the palm of one’s hand. Yet it remains obscured by dense yin, veiled ever deeper. It cannot be opened through clever conjecture, nor forced by clinging to texts or images. Only through the heart’s dynamic practice, with the Dao’s power firm and robust, can one bear the weight of its transmission, expand true wisdom, and attain it.\n\nAs the Perfected One Danyang once said:\n*\"Grasping the three essentials, the numinous terrace remains pure,\nYet mist-locked and smoke-shrouded, it will not open.\nOnly when Chongyang’s teachings arrive again,\nDoes the clear wind blow forth the bright moon.\"*\n\nThus, one must receive it through heart-transmission to fully comprehend it; it cannot be grasped through minor knowledge. Without this, even if the elixir congeals and the embryo forms, attaining a body of long life and the six supernatural powers, it has never been achieved.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: The True Earth**\n\nMaster Pingshu once wrote:\n*\"Tiger leaps, dragon coils—waves surge rough,\nAt the central field, the mysterious pearl is born.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"If li and kan lack wu and ji,\nThough they contain the four images, the elixir will not form.\nOnly when true earth is embraced by both,\nDo golden sands return.\"*\n\nThis clarifies that earth is the center of the five phases, the master of the three fires, governing the eight directions and rooting the nine qi—it is called the true empty earth. It is the great cauldron for planting medicine, the palace where the primordial treasure is born, gathering the light without shadow and receiving the fluids of the eight waters. It is the pure land of awakening, the realm of eternal brightness without night.\n\nAbove, it unites the sun and moon cauldron; below, it grasps the dragon and tiger furnace. It steals and refines the qi of heaven and earth, giving birth to the crystals of li and kan. Those who receive its dharma cannot fail to ascend as heavenly immortals.\n\nHave you not seen the myriad commentaries stating that lead and mercury are sown in the earth, reaped morning and night? Yet if sown too shallowly, the seed floats and does not grow; if too deeply, it rots and does not sprout—how much worse if one fails to find the true earth! Like roots and sprouts, with earth they live, without it they perish: this is the eternal principle.\n\nKnow clearly that the yellow sprout grows, the jade bud blooms, and the true creation is cultivated—all depend on this earth. The true spirit and intent are one with it. Without gathering the three primal powers and the seven returns, the mechanism of the yang spirit cannot be achieved, and transformation cannot be completed. When spirit arrives here, qi responds; when qi arrives, spirit becomes numinous. With numinosity, form manifests, appearing without limit, responding to stillness as it arises—how great is the divine function of this earth!\n\nAs the Perfected One Changchun said:\n*\"If the inch of heart can be directly embodied,\nOne shall ascend to the Great Luo for all time.\"*\nThis clarifies the true earth’s function.\n\nThose who abandon this in their practice are like lost travelers seeking home or those who mistake stones for valleys—how can they ever find life?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: Heart and Breath Interdependent**\n\nHaving attained insight and resolute determination, one must untie bonds, release burdens, restrain anger, and still desire. Of utmost importance is the interdependence of heart and breath.\n\nBreath is the method of nurturing life: it should be soft and continuous, fermenting the primordial qi, never allowing it to scatter with joy or anger. Always preserve it, warming and nourishing the primordial palace, gradually congealing its essence until it transforms into the cinnabar treasure.",

      "translated_text": "Where the heart abides, the breath abides; where the breath moves, the heart moves. Using the heart as the method to gather thoughts, one should ever maintain clarity to protect the wondrous source of numinous awareness, never allowing that awareness to stir with delusive conditions. Thus shall the vast and luminous spirit be revealed, the essence ever bright and undimmed.\n\nIf one can employ both the heart and breath in tandem, what could surpass this? Surely neither can be lacking. Have you not heard: to awaken to the eternal yet fail to grasp destiny is the foremost malady in cultivation; to grasp destiny’s foundation yet remain deluded about the ancestral nature is like a mirror seeking its reflection without a precious glass?\n\nOnly when the body is free of affairs and qi does not scatter, when the heart is without contrivance and spirit is undisturbed—only then is it achieved. Yet to purify thoughts and regulate the heart, to nurture breath and sustain life, this is the interdependent method. Should one lose the central balance, it becomes the false view of contrivance; if no method is attained, no form embraced, this is the function of quiescence. Should one lose the central balance, it falls into the false sect of dull emptiness.\n\nThus, the method cannot be clung to, nor can it be discarded; it resides in the space between use and abandonment. One must awaken the universal eye, open true wisdom, embody yet not cling to form, and apply the four practices of acting, stopping, allowing, and ceasing without falling into the illness of attachment. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, the four dignified postures must not follow delusive thoughts. Free from the grasping of discriminating emotions, the heart becomes like wind in empty space—without reliance or cessation, unstained and unattached. The heart empties itself, penetrating and illuminating the One Reality, suddenly unbounded and unimpeded.\n\nThis is the essence of the two wondrous methods, the timeless practice of all ages, the foundation for ascending to the One Vehicle.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: Dying Yin to Generate Yang**\n\nThe Three Sages’ Jade Instructions state: “The world does not understand dying yin. Yang is the root of life, while yin is the root of death to yang. Simply absorb the numinous tortoise to put the yin stem to death, and spirit will naturally arise—do not mistake the death of the yin stem for the death of the Dao.”\n\nAlas! Those who cultivate the body know only to suppress desire. Little do they realize that with a single thought of the heart, qi scatters with the heart, and essence perishes with qi. Have you not heard the words of the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring: “A single thought of lust stirs, and the harmonious qi of the hundred bones is harmed”?\n\nOnly those who attain the method can put the yin stem to death as if the six desires and seven emotions vanish in the moment, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms utterly extinguished without trace, all myriad concerns suddenly stilled. Thus, the true thought of reality arises, and even in the presence of phenomena, the heart remains unmoved—like white jade cast into mud yet unstained, as steadfast as Mount Tai. The Three Passes close without residue, the Gate of Life’s key is flung wide open. The ninefold radiance transforms qi, the five metals birth misty clouds; the double-headed jade deer rears high to spit golden wind, the three-inch crimson dragon lowers to gather the liquid of wood. The medicine furnace refines mercury, the crucible and cauldron congeal frost; the body transforms into pure yang, form and spirit both wondrous. Leaping beyond the confines of heaven and earth, released from the bonds of yin and yang—this mechanism is the urgent task of cultivating the body.\n\nSome claim that without dying yin, desire instantly vanishes—such cases may exist, but I have never witnessed them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: Qi and Spirit Deviations**\n\nAfter the adept’s qi attains primordial chaos, the original qi returns to its source, overflowing and coursing through the body, causing frequent stirrings that resemble madness. Each movement occurs in eighty-one cycles, leading some to mistakenly believe in possession by another soul—this is not so. If this qi deviation is not corrected, it becomes a spirit deviation, manifesting as visions of gods and ghosts, knowledge of fortune and misfortune, causes and effects, which some mistake for divine insight and numinous clarity—this, too, is not so. If this spirit deviation is not corrected, it becomes demonic illusion, where inner deviations summon outer deviations, giving rise to myriad strange phenomena.\n\nSuch a person with such an affliction harbors the seed of calamity, the root of losing life and body, the ghostly path to ruin. Outwardly appearing correct yet inwardly false, how is this different from a sheep in tiger’s skin or one who grasps reeds while mistaking them for orchids?\n\nWhy do those of us who are gentlemen of the Dao not discern this early? If one seizes the mechanism and aligns spirit and qi correctly, refining them with the proper method, the hun and po harmonize; refining them with precise measures, spirit and essence coalesce. Gradually congealing and transforming, the numinous flesh reveals its form, condensing into the sacred embryo. Golden light fills the chamber, swirling and enveloping; the true form transmutes into pure yang, spirit dwells in the true abode, flying forth from the crown of the head. My presence becomes luminous, radiance pervades all, inner and outer shining brilliantly, merging with the Great Void without distinction. This is the true realm.\n\nThus, nature and life are both perfected, pervading and fusing without obscurity. Only then can one hear the whispers at the ear and perceive with the eye behind the head—this is the universal discourse of the mysterious gate through the ages.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Verifying the Function of the Dao**\n\nSomeone asked: “I have heard that those who cultivate in youth have strong foundations, but in old age, lead is depleted and mercury scarce. How is this?”\n\nBetween the time before parents were born and after death, where are the essence, blood, qi, and fluids? After demise, they return to earth, water, fire, and wind. In these two intervals, existence seems absent yet is present everywhere—how can one distinguish self from other, or speak of form? Why engage in false cultivation, leaving the heart ever more doubtful and unresolved?”\n\nI replied: “Excellent question. Let me tell you. Long ago, Chen Ninwu answered Yu Chan: ‘The Dao is originally formless, likened to dragon and tiger; the Dao is originally nameless, compared to lead and mercury. Taking heaven and earth as the crucible, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, through the work of seven returns and nine reversions, one refines a body of pure yang for eternal life.’\n\nThis is not attained by clinging to form or contrivance. It quietly resides in the realm of the indistinct and obscure—where is there self or other, form or appearance? Its body shines without shadow, its spirit functions freely, its nature contains myriad virtues, its function transcends a hundred errors.\n\nYet the original true neither clings nor departs. In movement, it gathers intent and enters the mysterious darkness; in stillness, it merges spirit and emerges into empty quiescence. Between movement and stillness, inner and outer radiance mutually reflect.”",

      "translated_text": "A body is like a crystal pagoda, illuminating earth and shining upon heaven, its radiance all-pervading and undimmed. The original nature is like a pearl in a dish, perfectly luminous, vibrantly alive, flawlessly pure. Thus manifesting the wondrous essence of the original body, its transformations flow without stagnation, names and forms do not abide—united with the Dao in truth, one realizes that what came before and what remains after all things vanish are equally empty.\n\nThis great matter of karmic affinity is the very Way of the Heavenly Immortals. Some may assent, then take their leave with these words.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Five Teachings**\nThe Great Dao is formless and without substance, utterly empty and profoundly quiescent—inaudible when listened for, invisible when gazed upon, intangible when grasped. Yet though its body bears no image, cultivation follows an ordered sequence.\n\nOne must first awaken from delusion to attain the beginning, comprehend the beginning to reach the end, achieve the end to return to sudden enlightenment, and fully realize sudden enlightenment to enter perfect completeness. From this, we know that the beginning descends from the origin into manifestation, moving from non-being into being. Next, one gathers manifestation back to the origin, returning from being into non-being. Finally, both origin and manifestation are forgotten, being and non-being are both transcended—seeing through all forms as illusory, only then does one merge with the Dao.\n\nNaturally and spontaneously, every phenomenon reveals truth, every thing becomes luminous, pervading all realms and empty space—all is the treasure of one’s own home. This is not attained by clinging to images in search of mystery or parsing texts for understanding. This radiant clarity arises from the mind’s dharma, thoroughly realized yet unobstructed, emerging from profound stillness and non-doing.\n\nIf one neglects the work of beginning and end, merely lashing the mind to force entry into principle, claiming sudden awakening without cultivation, directly pointing to the original emptiness—pure as the void—this is mere verbal comprehension while the heart remains unenlightened. Sitting in dry emptiness until death, one achieves nothing. Have you not heard: “Sudden awakening to the One Mind must be perfected through the myriad practices of complete cultivation; a moment’s enlightenment to the Dao requires the long grinding of aeons”? Alas, cultivators of the body—why not ponder these words again and again?\n\nIf one hears without depth, knows without clarity, knows without clarity, cannot exhaust its essence—then practice yields no accomplishment. Is this mere empty talk?\n\n**Chapter Nine: Forgetting Form to Nurture Qi**\nHumans, endowed with the essence of the Three Powers and formed by the Four Great Elements, cling to the self and thus experience pain and itching, craving wealth and honor, seeking comfort in dwelling and satiety in food. Daily, they cherish and protect themselves, yet in bondage, they fall into decay. To nurture the original and nourish the plain, one must clearly perceive qi—only by forgetting form can this be achieved.\n\nThe True Man of Everlasting Spring once said: “One must ultimately risk life and limb—how long can one cling to protecting face and head?” Is this not the function of forgetting form? He also said: “The heart is like an unmoving mountain; qi is like the ever-tidal sea.” Is this not the mechanism of nurturing qi?\n\nThe True Man of Cinnabar Yang said: “When the body is empty, qi circulates.” This teaching is not false. Moreover, the *Yin Fu Jue* states: “All who cultivate the body must kill the heart, embrace the One, treasure qi, and refine essence.” Clearly knowing that the qi within the body must not scatter, the practitioner should dull the senses and break the body, becoming like withered wood. The Gate of Heaven opens wide, the Earthly Door is firmly sealed. With right mindfulness present, all myriad thoughts vanish. Breathing is soft and continuous, as if existing, as if not. Gathering and refining the harmonious qi, one opens the cave of dragon and tiger, connecting with the true qi of the Great One’s primordial palace. Day and night, yin and yang ascend and descend without cease; water and fire are drawn and replenished without error, warming the lead crucible with gentle, unbroken heat.\n\nCultivating the true fire, one does not transgress the three barriers or the hundred transformations—this is what “gentle and unbroken” means. Those who dwell in the upper heavens—are these empty words? When the Sea of Qi is purified, evil cannot invade. Always like a hen brooding her eggs, like a deer nurturing its antlers, one eternally guards the One qi to return to the root, attaining the Dao of preserving life and achieving immortality. Those who rode the carp into the water and rode the carp out—was this not achieved by forgetting form?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Forgetting Qi to Nurture Spirit**\nFor those who advance in cultivation: when principle is attained with perfect balance, fire does not burn dry, water does not overflow. The two are harmonized according to measure, and the One qi is subdued in the furnace without escape. The Golden Elixir is refined and returned to congeal the true—how can one cling to it without forgetting?\n\nIf one does not forget, it is like crossing a river and not abandoning the boat—difficult to reach the other shore; or like recovering from illness yet continuing to take medicine—harming the upright qi. Master Ping Shu said: “Do not use ordinary lead; having used true lead, discard it.” This is the true esoteric method of using lead. “Use lead yet do not cling to it”—these are sincere words.\n\nThus, when the work of nurturing spirit is urgent, one must settle into stillness and forget qi. When the heart does not generate activity, principle does not kill spirit. This undying spirit is not the spirit of thoughts, intentions, or deliberations—it is one root with heaven and earth, one body with the myriad things. Nurturing it with subtle mechanism, the body seems as if not there. The sun and moon mutually illuminate, inner celestial light shines forth—appearing like a luminous pearl, resembling the full moon. Illuminating inner vision, day and night are distinct, transforming into a treasury of spiritual powers.\n\nThus, spirit is offered to spirit, and spirit becomes numinous—like a crane riding the wind, its comings and goings unfathomable. Do not mistake this for mere marvel; one must return to nurturing the empty valley, steadfast as an unmoving mountain. Suddenly, one day, a transformed body is born—sending forth and gathering in are at one’s command. This is the full attainment of the Way of nurturing spirit.\n\nHave you not heard the words of the True Man Zhang in *The Song of Unfastening the Jade Pendant*:\n“The yang spirit leaves the body, dark and profound.\nIn an instant, it roams the Three Isles.\nOnce entry and exit are mastered, restrain it—\nseek further mystery.\nMerge with true emptiness, and the Great Void is complete.”\nTruly, these are the words!\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Forgetting Spirit to Nurture Emptiness**\nThose who have attained the method of refining spirit guard the spirit in the mysterious palace, pure and undefiled, yet cannot yet merge with emptiness and transform. One must forget this spirit to nurture emptiness. Thus, one neither abides in non-doing nor exhausts doing—neither clings to the already-extinguished extinction nor gives rise to the not-yet-moved movement.",

      "translated_text": "At this juncture of cessation and continuation, when the mind abides in stillness without thought, one pierces through the emptiness of all dharmas and the unreality of all appearances. Each delusive condition dissolves upon encounter, and all defilements naturally cease. There is no abiding in abiding, no thought in thought—obscurely, it seems to act without acting, serenely, it merges emptiness with emptiness. The substance of this emptiness suddenly becomes unbound.\n\nShould one fail to grasp the transformations of nurturing from beginning to end: if nurtured above, it scorches the eyes and reddens the face, losing the refinement of the true heart. If nurtured below, it sinks into the elixir field, merely sustaining the path of grains. If nurtured externally, one chases shadows and squanders golden sand. If nurtured internally, one adorns the heart’s subtleties, constricting without universality. Thus, each clings to one aspect, fostering delusion in turn, contending over this and that, gain and loss, unable to free themselves—unworthy of discussion.\n\nThe supreme subtlety lies in realizing the nurturing of qi and spirit to attain inner vision. Within, one perceives the emptiness of body and mind; without, the emptiness of all things. In all matters of seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing, one does not cling to appearances, attaining utmost purity and great clarity. Thus, one recognizes it face-to-face, abides in tranquility with mastery, and gradually merges with the Great Void. Within, one embraces the radiance of sun and moon; without, one blends with the bounds of emptiness. Without premeditating the mind in the Great Void, one naturally unites with it, free from the slightest obstruction or the faintest stain. Internally and externally, above and below, no distinctions arise—only a serene, unmoving effort, pure and forged into oneness.\n\nAt this point, heaven is not heaven, earth is not earth, and one knows not where the self resides. Gathered, it forms shape; dispersed, it becomes qi—lucid and unbound, standing solitary and transcendent. This is called shattering emptiness to attain completion.\n\nYet words cannot exhaust meaning, nor meaning exhaust words—transcending both, it is transmitted beyond teaching, beyond the written line.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Fusion Without Attachment**\nIt is said: Only because the eye does not see itself can it see objects; only because a mirror does not illuminate itself can it reflect objects. If it were to see or illuminate itself, it would be too occupied to attend to others. The marvel of vision and reflection lies in their focus elsewhere, thus reversing light upon objects, making all things radiant and flawless—dust becomes earth, a drop becomes the sea. One realizes the non-duality of principle and phenomena, the unity of movement and stillness.\n\nThus, the inner mind does not arise, knowing external realms are fundamentally empty. One naturally follows conditions without clinging to distinctions, freeing the heart from obstructions. Like gold refined a hundred times, impurities vanish and brilliance emerges—evidencing the precision of Dao-power, the cleansing of the mind’s profound vision. External dust is instantly relinquished; one sees the emptiness of all appearances, delusive conditions do not arise. In the perfect clarity of true reality, not a single thing remains, nor any suffering aggregates to obstruct. All realms are gathered into one mind.\n\nHaving merged appearances with essence to return to the source, one manifests true realms from the original mind, revealing the wondrous existence of the formless. Establishing methods to respond to change, one deploys the power of concentration and wisdom, manifesting various expedient means to cultivate the right knowledge of myriad practices, revealing the pure true nature like empty space. Empty and formless, what thing could obstruct it?\n\nThus, the profound measure enters the microcosm without being small, encompasses the Great Void without being large. Only this mind and this realm, secretly fused and perfectly merged, utterly transcending traces—this is the true emptiness of the essential Dharma-realm.\n\nIf one does not establish merit, the mind and realm remain obscured, unable to simultaneously dissolve form and emptiness, yet falsely claiming to fuse the ten thousand things without attachment—how deluded!\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: No Cultivation, No Attainment**\nThere are those of the Lesser Vehicle who cling to emptiness and fixate on annihilation, leaving nature without refuge and dharma without rectification. Fearing form as an obstacle, they extinguish form to reveal emptiness, or separate from form to reveal emptiness. Seeing all appearances as illusory, nothing worthy of embrace, they fail to perceive the creative emptiness within, the wondrous existence of emptiness—though not governing, it mysteriously coalesces within emptiness. How unlike the illusory flowers in the sky or the mirage’s semblance of existence, which are not truly present.\n\nThey claim sudden awakening to no-cultivation, yet do not understand the cultivation within no-cultivation, the seeking within non-seeking. How do they differ from the ignorant, who fundamentally neither cultivate nor seek? Like beasts of burden, merely refraining from active thought—can this be called emptiness?\n\nTruly, without entering the vast sea, one cannot obtain the wish-fulfilling pearl. Without cultivating the practices of wisdom and expedient means, one cannot adorn the Dharma-body. Without seeking the original true luminous essence, one cannot perfect the Dharma-nature.\n\nOnce delusive thoughts suddenly cease, the original true essence becomes manifest—there is no other truth to seek; this is the seeking within non-seeking. The Dharma-body being complete, it responds to conditions as they arise—there is no other true essence to cultivate; this is the cultivation within no-cultivation.\n\nThus, neither delusion nor truth—what is there to cultivate, what to attain? The numinous awareness is fundamentally without a single thing; why cling to the toils of life? The body remains as unmoving as Mount Tai, the mind as unobstructed as empty space—revealing the wondrous essence, radiant and free from all names and forms. Seeing the emptiness of all things, where is there cultivation or attainment?\n\n**Biographical Account**\nMaster Liu Zhiyuan of Tongxuan, a native of Gaolouli in Xici, was a disciple of Chaoranzi.
