  "full_translation": "**Dragon-Tiger Reversion Elixir Formula**\n\n**Title:** *Dragon-Tiger Reversion Elixir Formula*\n**Attributed to:** *Jinlingzi* of the Tang Dynasty. Two scrolls.\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canonical Daoist Treasury of the Zhengtong Era), *Dongshen* (Cavern Spirit) section, *Zhongshu* (Miscellaneous Arts) category.\n\n**Scroll One: Jinlingzi’s Explanation of the *Zhiyehongying* (Purple Leaf Red Flower) Great Reversion Elixir Formula**\n\nThe Reversion Elixir originates from the quintessence of the Nine Heavens, nurtured by the Twenty-Four Celestial Worthies. True Water, True Fire—encompassing both external and internal—refine the Five Divine Energies and the movements of *qi*, accumulating as *shuishā* (water-sand). When the gathered *qi* reaches its utmost, it becomes the *Zhihuá Hóngyīng* (Purple Bloom Red Flower) Elixir.\n\nAgain, from the *Wù-Jǐ Zhōnggōng* (Mid-Court of the Fifth-Sixth Heavenly Stems) Yellow Gold, the essence is purified through the *Lǐ* (Alchemical Process), and its completion lies in the *Jǐu* (Nine). Thus, the Yang Gold undergoes transformation, its dynamic *qi* and alchemical mechanisms shifting, its essence changing form, and it harmonizes with the Five Directions’ constitution. Only then does it transcend the Three Primordial Elements (*Sānyuán*), shed its material body, and return to its True Nature—hence the name *Reversion Elixir*, a marvelous and refined metamorphosis.\n\nThe Reversion Elixir has no fixed method; the *Jīnbì Jīng* (Golden Splendor Scripture) and the *Cāntóng Qì* (Grand Concordance of the Mysterious) are its methods. Since antiquity, true immortals have all concealed their secrets. Sacred texts are hidden in celestial caverns, golden tablets sealed within the Daoist sanctuaries. Even if the oral formulas are inscribed on paper, they must still be transmitted by a master and cannot be recklessly applied. Their principles are profound and unfathomable; their meanings hidden and difficult to discern.\n\nNow, for those who love the Dao and aspire to longevity, they must first distinguish the quality of their medicinal ingredients—high or low—and recognize *True Mercury* and *True Lead*. They must understand the temperaments and nature of metals and minerals before refining Lead and Mercury with Fire, for these are the foundations of the elixir.\n\n**Discerning Mercury**\nAccording to the hidden names in Daoist scriptures, Mercury is called:\n- *Héshàng Lǎonǚ* (Old Woman of the Riverbank),\n- *Chángshēngzǐ* (Child of Longevity),\n- *Gōng* (Mercury),\n- *Tàiyáng Liúzhū* (Luminous Pearl of the Great Sun),\n- *Shénjiāo* (Divine Glue),\n- *Língyángzǐ* (Child of the Ling Mountain),\n- *Xuánmíng Lóng* (Mysterious Brightness Dragon),\n- *Xuánshuǐ* (Mysterious Water),\n- *Báihǔ Nǎo* (Brain of the White Tiger),\n- *Jīnyín Xí* (Mercury-Lead Mat).\n\nJinlingzi says: Mercury is the divine essence of the Five Yang Energies, where the Five Divine Energies converge into one. It takes form in *dānshā* (cinnabar), residing in the South. When it is extracted from minerals, the Five Metals and seventy-two stones—most of which absorb excess *Yīn qi*—become coarse and rigid, their nature sluggish and their potency far inferior. Thus, Mercury is called *Rénshuǐ* (Ninth Water), for it is water in essence. It can ascend lightly, transform subtly, and command the obedience of all spirits.\n\nIn totality, it is called *Dānyáng* (Elixir-Sun), as water encompasses the Eight Stones, containing within itself the essence of gold. Its cinnabar holds the most refined and divine, the most sacred and luminous. Even a mere two *liǎng* (ounces) held in one’s sleeve can repel malevolent spirits; how much more so when it is ingested and harmonized within the Five Viscera?\n\nThe Five Divine Energies converge, the *qi* coalesces, and the form is born as cinnabar—this is the purest essence of the Great Sun, the sovereign of the Red Emperor, the true body of the Gold-Fire, in communion with the Eight Stones, responsive to the Twenty-Four *qi* Movements. It is the master of all spirits, the root of transformation, the foundation of the Luminous God, capable of change and metamorphosis—thus it is called the *Chìlóng* (Vermilion Dragon). If it soars aloft, it is named *Zhūwū* (Crimson Crow).\n\nThe elixir is formed when gold is affected by fire, hence its name *dān*. Mercury is when fire departs from gold, hence its name *gōng*. When the essence of gold and fire conjoin, they contain the pure and settled *qi* of the Mysterious Primordial, the fundamental essence of the Reversion Elixir, and the source of the Great Medicine. When their *virtue/power* (*dé*) is harmonized, all phenomena arise; when their substance is separated, they vanish into the unfathomable.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"The Yang Essence blazes resplendent; obtaining it allows one to return the soul and restore the spirit.\"*\n\nAccording to the *Shòushòu Jì* (Record of Receiving Longevity), it is also said: *\"The Yang Essence blazes resplendent; it solidifies the soul and steadies the spirit, being the supreme grade of the immortals.\"*\n\nIf one attains the highest-grade cinnabar, it requires no further refining or fusion—it is already fit for ingestion. This is the natural Reversion Elixir.\n\nThough cinnabar is the essence of the True Yang, surpassing all things in its luminosity, its origin varies by region—mountains, valleys, and lands—each absorbing different *qi*, resulting in tens of varieties. One must carefully discern them.\n\nEven among ordinary people, their spiritual nature is unequal; the flesh and blood of birds and beasts also differ, and must be clearly distinguished.\n\nThe highest-grade cinnabar grows in the stone cavities of the *Chénjǐn* (Zhenjin) Prefecture, manifesting in multiple hues.\n\nThe middle-grade cinnabar is found in *Jiāoguì* (Guangxi-Jiangxi), also with several forms.\n\nThe lowest-grade cinnabar is from *Héngshào* (Hengyang-Shaoyang), with various qualities and grades.\n\nAll are shaped by the purity or turbidity of their constitution, the true or false nature of their *qi*, and the division of their essence as they resonate with metals and minerals. Those that absorb the True *qi* can be ingested to attain communion with the Mysterious Dao, making one a High Immortal. Those that absorb partial *qi* grant longevity and worldly survival.\n\nFor instance, the *Guāngmíngshā* (Luminous Cinnabar) of the highest grade emerges from the stone cavities of *Chénjǐn* Mountain, atop a white bed and white stratum, in clusters of twelve or nine pieces—these being the most potent. Those of seven or five pieces are of secondary efficacy.\n\nWithin each cluster, there is a large pearl weighing over ten *liǎng*, called the *Zhǔjūn* (Master Sovereign). Surrounding it are smaller pieces, also weighing eight or nine *liǎng*, or even six or seven, called the *Chén* (Subordinates), which encircle and defer to the central pearl.\n\nOn the four sides of the cluster, there is also a mixed cinnabar of one or two *dǒu* (bushels), embracing the jade-like cluster and its crimson bed.\n\nFrom the mixed cinnabar outside the cluster, if one selects the *Fúróngtóu* (Peony-Head) variety, places it upon red silk, and it remains luminously transparent, it is also counted among the highest grade.\n\nAnother variety resembles *Mǎyáchéng* (Horse-Tooth Form), with a white exterior and floating brilliance—this is the highest grade.\n\nThe *Báimǎyáshā* (White Horse-Tooth Cinnabar), if elongated like a *xiàoshēng* (smiling figure) and colored red-purple, is also the highest grade.\n\nThe *Zǐlíngshā* (Purple Luminous Cinnabar), if it appears as stone fragments with sharp edges and emits a greenish glow, is of the lowest grade.\n\nThe cinnabar from *Jiāoguì* (Guangxi-Jiangxi), if it grows in clusters or is obtained by striking stones and forms like *Fúróngtóu* (Peony-Head) while remaining luminous, is also of the highest grade.\n\nIf it appears as coarse grains, with three or four pieces weighing a *jīn* (pound), and is translucent, it is of the middle grade.\n\nIf it appears as flakes or fragments and is clear, it is of the lowest grade, such as that from *Héngshào* (Hengyang-Shaoyang).\n\nIn summary, cinnabar obtained from clusters or by striking stones, if it emits a red glow, is also of the lowest grade—such as *Xīshā* (Stream Cinnabar).\n\nThere are grains that form and are translucent—if one refines and ingests them, one may achieve longevity and remain in the world, though not yet ascend to the rank of an *upper immortal* (上仙).\n\nCinnabar from the earth, born within earthly cavities, and stream cinnabar nurtured in the sandy soil of streams, when they emerge, are mixed—thus they do not qualify as *upper-grade elixir* (上药) for consumption.\n\nThe *seat-grown* cinnabar is the supreme grade of the elixir. Obtaining the central *master cinnabar* (主君砂) from its seat—one grain—when refined and ingested into the five *zàng* (viscera), its efficacy becomes manifest, and it is called the *upper-grade cinnabar elixir* (上丹台). The vital *zhèngqì* (正气) endures, and one transcends all worldly burdens.\n\nFurther, after refining it through seven *fǎn* (returns) and nine *huán* (retreats), one attains effortless ascension. Hence, the true essence of *yang* (male, luminous) *qi* descends and coalesces into a radiant, full orb—untainted by any *piānxié* (perverse, pathogenic) influence.\n\nBut the refined cinnabar of the *Peony-Head* (芙蓉头) form, which is luminous and round, is indeed the supreme elixir for *immortals* (神仙) to consume.\n\nThe *scriptures* (经) state that cinnabar is the *natural elixir* (自然还丹).\n\nMoreover, as with the *jade-seat cinnabar* (玉座之砂) commonly known by the world—such as the *gold-seat cinnabar* (金座) or *heaven-seat cinnabar* (天座)—\n\nThe *Supreme Purple Dragon’s Mysterious Elixir* (太上紫龙玄华之丹) is beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.\n\nThe *jade-seat cinnabar* is refined by those of *common aspiration* (俗流志士) who accumulate merit and cultivate its essence to attain immortality.\n\nThe *gold-seat cinnabar* is obtained by those with *immortal predisposition* (仙骨), who purify their spirits and refine their essence in seclusion within mountain caves. When they gather and consume its cinnabar, they ascend instantly, their bodies *avianizing* (羽化). Ascending to the *heaven-seat cinnabar* (天座), they then partake of the elixir of the *Supreme Celestial Immortals* (太上天仙真官), not the medicine of lesser immortals.\n\nThe *jade-seat cinnabar*, having absorbed the *pure, luminous, and refined essence* (阳虚之清精) of sixty thousand years, transforms into *gold-seat cinnabar*. The *gold-seat cinnabar* is yellow within its seat, bearing five grains layered in growth, surrounded on all sides by forty-five small pearls.\n\nThe *gold-seat cinnabar*, having absorbed the *pure, luminous, and refined essence* of sixty thousand years further, transforms into *heaven-seat cinnabar*. The *heaven-seat cinnabar* is verdant in color, bearing nine grains within its seat, layered in growth, and encircled on all sides by seventy-two grains.\n\nIt dwells in the *floating void* (飘飘太虚), perpetually guarded by the *Supreme Unity Spirit* (太一之神). On the *Upper Primordial Day* (上元之日), the *true officials* (真官) descend to harvest it, and the mountain suddenly blazes, its light radiant as fire.\n\nThe *heaven-seat cinnabar* is gathered by the *true officials*—common mortals cannot obtain it.\n\nThe *luminous cinnabar* (光明砂), for every *jīn* (pound), contains only two *liǎng* (ounces) of *stone qi* (石气) and yields fourteen *liǎng* of *mercury* (水银).\n\nThe *White Horse Tooth Cinnabar* (白马牙砂), for every *jīn*, contains four *liǎng* of *stone qi* and yields twelve *liǎng* of *mercury*.\n\nThe *Purple Luminous Cinnabar* (紫灵砂), for every *jīn*, contains six *liǎng* of *stone qi* and yields ten *liǎng* of *mercury*.\n\nThe *upper-grade, luminous stream cinnabar* (上色通明溪砂), for every *jīn*, yields eight *liǎng* and a half of *mercury*, with seven *liǎng* and a half of *stone qi*.\n\nThe *mixed-color earth cinnabar* (杂色土砂), for every *jīn*, yields seven *liǎng* and a half of *mercury*, with eight *liǎng* and a half of *stone qi*.\n\n*Stone qi* (石气) is the *void essence* of *fire stone* (火石).\n\nAfter the *mercury* is extracted, a *stone residue* (石胎) of one *liǎng*—greenish-white and gray—remains.\n\nThe *luminous cinnabar*, having absorbed the *clear, refined, and true essence* (清通澄朗正真之精气) of the *Supreme Sun* (太阳), forms into cinnabar. Consuming one *liǎng* is equivalent in power to four *liǎng* of *White Horse Tooth Cinnabar*.\n\nThe *White Horse Tooth Cinnabar* absorbs the *balanced, gentle, and compliant essence* (平和柔顺之精气) of the *Supreme Sun*. Consuming one *liǎng* is equivalent in power to eight *liǎng* of *Purple Luminous Cinnabar*.\n\nThe *Purple Luminous Cinnabar* absorbs the *void qi* of mountains and marshes, while the *stream cinnabar* and *earth cinnabar* of mixed grades all absorb *turbulent, stagnant, and untrue qi* (浊滞不真之气), forming into cinnabar—none can compare in potency.\n\nHaving thus distinguished the grades of cinnabar elixir, one knows the hierarchy of *mercury*.\n\nFor the cultivation of *elixir medicine* (至药), one must absolutely avoid *mercury* of mixed grades. This is the *true secret* (真诀).\n\nThe *Great Cavern True Scripture* (大洞真经) conceals its *true mercury* (真汞), taking only *upper-grade cinnabar* (上品丹砂) that is of a single hue, extracting its *mercury*, and then infusing it with *internal water and internal fire qi* (内水内火气) to make it *true mercury*.\n\nThus the *scripture* says: *\"Mixed grades of different kinds—how could they unite in form and reside?\"* (杂类不同种，焉能合体居). Only those of the same kind are *true mercury*—also called *mother-child mercury* (子母).\n\nThe *Immortal Scriptures* keep this secret and do not reveal it.\n\nThe *Child of Jinling* (金陵子) says: *\"When mercury is cast upon cinnabar, it produces cinnabar grains—this is also the gold-seat cinnabar.\"*\n\n*True mercury* (真汞) is obtained by extracting mercury from the *upper-grade cinnabar*, then infusing it with *internal water and internal fire qi* before it can be so named.\n\n**Method for Extracting Mercury from Cinnabar:**\n\nTake *jīnzhú* (筋竹) as a tube, storing it fully in three *joints* (节). Pierce a hole in the upper joint, large enough for a *bullet* (弹丸). Use a small hole in the middle joint, like the size of a *tendon* (筋头), for the mercury to drip through. First, lay two layers of thick wax paper beneath the middle joint.\n\nThen take finely ground cinnabar and place it within the tube. Secure the tube tightly with hemp rope, and steam it for one day.\n\nNext, wrap it in yellow clay, making the layer three *fēn* (fingers-width) thick, and bury it in the earth. Level the tube with the ground, and firmly pack the surrounding soil so that no *qi* escapes.\n\nPile wood atop and ignite it. After one *cycle of fire* (复时), let the flames penetrate the upper joint of the tube. The mercury will then flow downward into the middle joint, undivided by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nWhen the fire is small and the mercury begins to emerge, the remaining ash is still black and purple. Repeat the process until the mercury is fully gathered, ensuring the fire is sufficient.\n\nAmong all methods, this is the most essential and wondrous.\n\nEven if cinnabar is of the same kind, once its mercury is extracted and mixed with other cinnabar, it must again absorb *internal water and internal fire qi* before it can be used.\n\n**Method for Refining Mercury:**\n\nMercury: one *jīn* (pound)\n*Shíliúhuáng* (石硫黄, sulfur): three *liǎng* (ounces)\n\nGrind the *shíliúhuáng* into powder and place it in a porcelain basin. Apply gentle heat, and drip the mercury in slowly, stirring vigorously with the hand until it becomes *green sand* (青砂).\n\nThen transfer it into a porcelain *retreating vessel* (鉼, *huánluán* vessel), which can hold one *shēng* (pint). Seal it with clay, making the layer two *fēn* thick, and cover it tightly. Secure it completely.\n\nPlace it in a furnace, using one *jīn* of charcoal. Around the vessel on all sides, arrange the charcoal in long strands, totaling one *jīn*.\n\nThree days later, apply *wu* fire (violent fire) to burn it, using ten *jīn* of charcoal, divided into two portions—five *jīn* above, five *jīn* below—the vessel. When green vapor suddenly emerges, immediately coat it with thin, diluted clay, lest flames escape, until the charcoal is exhausted.\n\nWait for it to cool, then open it. The mercury will have transformed into *zǐshā* (紫砂, cinnabar sand), without loss of a single grain.\n\nAgain, take the previous *zǐshā* and mix it with one *jīn* of black lead. First, melt the black lead within the cauldron to form a liquid. Then, finely grind the *zǐshā* and toss it into the lead liquid. Remove the fire and quickly stir-fry it by hand until the mixture congeals into sand. Return it to the cauldron, grind it finely, cover it with salt to a thickness of two *fēn*, and press it firmly to ensure contact. Apply *wu* fire (violent fire) to it for half a day, and the refined mercury (*línggǒng*, 灵汞) will emerge, without loss of a single grain. This is called *internal water and fire qi* (内水火).\n\nThe *Jīnlíng* adept said: The essence of *yang* is fire, the essence of *yin* is water. When *yin* and *yang* are subdued and balanced, water and fire hold each other in check; hence, the *yang* and *yin* are governed by this principle.\n\nAgain, regarding cinnabar and mercury: Though one may distinguish their quality as high or low, there are instances where they have been tainted. Mercury, regardless of impurity, if it has come near the dead, is exceedingly difficult to discern. If cinnabar has been exposed to the *shēngsǐ* (生死, life-and-death) defilements, its outermost layer of vermilion will fall away, leaving the grains bright and clean, stripped of their coating. This indicates it has been tainted. Now, only select the cinnabar of the finest hue, for it alone, through sublimation and refinement, yields the purest mercury.\n\n**Discerning True Lead:**\n\nAccording to the *hidden names* in the Daoist scriptures, true lead is called by many names: *lìzhìshí* (立制石, stabilizing stone), *huángjīng* (黄精, yellow essence), *xuánhuá* (玄华, dark splendor), *báihǔ* (白虎, white tiger), *huángyá* (黄芽, yellow sprout), *héchē* (河车, celestial chariot), *huángchí* (黄池, yellow pool), *huánglóng* (黄龙, yellow dragon), and *mùxī* (木锡, wooden tin).\n\nThe *Lónghǔ Jīng* (龙虎经, *Dragon-Tiger Classic*) states: \"Lead is black externally, dark and splendid internally, with a golden body.\"\n\nThe *Qiántōng Jué* (潜通诀, *Subtle Penetration Canon*) says: \"The dark and white produce the golden *gōng* (公, sovereign). Majestic and towering, the beginning is established.\"\n\nThe *Jīnlíng* adept said: True lead is obtained by extracting it from *lìshí* (铆石, lead ore) through sublimation, without prior smelting or refining. It retains its primordial *yuángǔ* (元气, original qi), making it the true lead. The *Dà Dòng Zhēn Jīng* (大洞真经, *True Classic of the Great Cavern*) conceals its true lead, and it must not be divulged lightly.\n\nThe true *water and internal fire qi* (真水内火) are black lead and sulfur. Lead and tin both draw upon the *qi* of the northern *bīng* (壬) and *guǐ* (癸) stems. Tin absorbs the *bīng* essence, while lead imbibes the *guǐ* qi. Gold ultimately depends upon *guǐ*, so lead is the refined essence of the utmost *yin*. As the Daoist scriptures say: \"If lead is not true, the mercury will not bond with it.\" Therefore, lead must be true.\n\n**Further Canon:**\n\nThe *Great Return* (大还) and *Nine Returns* (九还) are different names for the same process. *Return* (返) refers to sand transforming into gold, while *Return* (还) refers to gold reverting back to cinnabar. The scriptures say: \"Return to my native place, revert to my eternal form. When taken, I will ascend in broad daylight to the Celestial Sovereign.\"\n\nThe cinnabar furnace and cauldron must also harmonize the *Three Realms* (天地人, *Tiāndìrén*) of Heaven, Earth, and Man.\n\nThe cauldron should be made of *yàojīn* (药金, medicinal gold) weighing twenty-four *liǎng*, corresponding to the twenty-four *qi* (气, seasonal breaths). Eight *liǎng* are used for the lid, which should hold nine *héng* (合, cups). Take it during the *jiǎchén* (甲辰, *Jiachen*) decan, specifically on the *wǔshēn* (戊申, *Wushen*) day, from the southwest *shēn* (申, *Shen*) direction. Use pure soil to construct the furnace, with an internal diameter of one *chǐ* (尺, foot) and two *cùn* (寸, inches). It must have three tiers and twelve gates, each gate equipped with a shutter.\n\nWith the finest *guāngmíngshā* (光明砂, luminous cinnabar) as the primary ingredient, assisted by black lead, sulfur, *chìshèng* (赤盛, red abundance), and *mǎyǎxiāo* (马牙消, horse-tooth borax), the *Seven Returns* and *Nine Returns* are the elixirs for longevity and ascension in this world.\n\nTake one *jīn* of cinnabar, crush it into pieces as fine as hemp seeds, and mix it with *shílíng* (石灵, stone spirit) and *mǎyǎxiāo*. Boil it in water for forty days, as *yang* (阳) medicine is refined by *yin* (阴) means.\n\nThen place it in the cauldron and refine it with *yin-yang* fire methods for five days. Four days are spent in the *kǎn* (坎, *Kan*) hexagram method—boiling. One day is spent in the *lí* (离, *Li*) hexagram method—flying with fire. Thus, five days constitute one *hòu* (候, period), and three periods make one *qì* (气, breath). Using eight breaths and twenty-four periods, a total of one hundred and twenty days, the cinnabar will have undergone sublimation.\n\nWrap it with *yánghuā* (盐花, salt flowers), then seal it with yellow soil as clay, pressing it tightly to secure the golden cauldron. Place it in the furnace and burn it with violent fire for thirty days.\n\nThen extract the sublimated silver, also called *huánghuǒyín* (黄火银, yellow-fire silver), adding one *liǎng* at a time, until it gradually becomes golden. After seven such returns, the cinnabar will be complete, known as *Xuánzhēn Jiàngxiā Shā* (玄真绛霞砂, *Mysterious True Vermilion-Crimson Sand*), which, when taken, grants longevity and worldly immortality. It can also transmute mercury and the five metals into treasures.\n\nAgain, take this *Jiàngxiā Shā* (绛霞砂, vermilion-crimson sand) and extract fifteen *liǎng* of *zǐjīn* (紫金, purple gold). Mix it with one *jīn* of true lead and five *liǎng* of sulfur. Combine these three substances, place them in the cauldron, and refine them for six cycles. In each cycle, add *yang* sulfur, using a golden cauldron and erecting a furnace platform. Begin the fire at the *Zǐ* (子) hour on *Jiǎ* (甲) days, and each cycle spans two months, sixty days.\n\nWhen the cinnabar is near completion, a purple vapor will rise continuously, obscuring the light of the sun and moon, causing the mountains and rivers to tremble. Upon its completion, it will ascend with a radiant glow, detaching from its gross form, resembling a nine-layered lotus, clinging to the cauldron lid—fifteen *liǎng* without loss of a single grain.\n\nWithin the cauldron, there will be twenty-four *liǎng* of lingering ash, colored like *zǐjīn*. A single pellet of this purple ash, the size of a hemp seed, can transmute one *jīn* of mercury and the five metals into supreme treasures.\n\nAncient immortals who mastered its true essence could, with a single dose of the *Seven Returns* sand, achieve extraordinary potency. Why has its truth not yet been verified? Because the *lǜyào* (绿药, green medicine) still retains its obstructive form and cannot yet ascend freely, remaining bound to the five elements as mere *shìhuǒ* (世火, mundane fire) and being consumed by it. Yet, with each of the nine transformations, the elixir becomes lighter and more refined, transcending ordinary matter, radiating a round and brilliant light, and its purple vapor ascends to the heavens. It encounters substances and transforms without obstruction, enduring countless refining cycles, never being consumed, and its essence grows ever more potent.\n\nThe inner flame does not burn the hand—\nthose who take it will ascend in misty flight,\nbecoming the exalted True Persons of the highest rank.\n\nThe Dao/Way, when grasped by the wise and virtuous intent,\nis indeed the fortune and longevity without bound\nfor the noble ones who attain it.\nFor the frivolous and dissipated, it brings calamity even to their nine ancestral generations.\n\nNor should one falsely speak and conceal the Dao/Way—\nbe cautious not to reveal one’s true purpose to the common mind.\n\nThe wise and foolish can be discerned;\nit is a matter of observation.\n\nThe **Lónghǔ Huán Dān Jié** (龙虎还丹诀, *Formula of the Dragon-Tiger Reversion Elixir*) says:\n\nGreat Reversion—ah, how difficult it is!\nThus the scripture states:\n*\"The Great Reversion is first granted by Heaven,\nthen returned to humanity.\nIf one has not accumulated merit through arduous practice,\nand aligned with the True,\nit cannot be attained.\"*\n\nThe sages have said:\n*\"Human life flees swiftly, like flowing water;\nin an instant, the form decays.\nThe gateway of life and death is vast—\nif not for the possession of wondrous elixirs and supreme medicines,\nthere is no other path.\"*\n\nThose who obtain it may ascend to the Three Pure Ones,\nlive for countless eons,\nbe attended by jade maidens,\nand amass treasures beyond measure.\nThis comes from *The Transmission of the Dark Lord*—\ntruly, it is the natural result of Heaven and Earth refining the **zhèngqì** (正气, *true qi*).\n\nSince ancient times, there have been elixirs of Great Reversion:\nthe Yellow Emperor’s **Jiǔdǐng Dān** (九鼎丹, *Nine Cauldrons Elixir*),\nLaozi’s Reversion Elixir,\nas well as **Lángyá** (琅牙), **Qǔchén** (曲晨), **Shénfú** (神符), **Báixuě** (白雪), **Wǔlíng** (五灵), and the **Èrshísì Dān** (二十四丹, *Twenty-Four Elixirs*).\nThere are also those brought from the Western lands.\nThough their teachings spread in the world,\nnone possess the authentic method.\n\n「Though there are written records, all merely point to the correspondence of yin and yang by name.\n\nThe sages conceal this gate in common secrecy—\nwhat is truly written is not recorded,\nwhat is recorded is not truly written.\nIf one relies on cleverness and intelligence,\nfollows the texts while neglecting their essence,\nand speculates with one’s own interpretations,\nthe more intricate the reasoning,\nthe farther one strays from the truth.\nHow then could one hope to glimpse\nthe mysteries of *Huángyá Jīnshuǐ* (黄芽金水, *Golden Seed and Water of the Yellow*),[^1]\nwhether through orthodox or heterodox paths?\n\nThe key lies in fire refinement and receiving the **qi**.\nIf a single phase is insufficient,\nthen the result is no better than worthless clay.\nAnd yet, the journey is still long—\none must first seek a worthy teacher,\nhear the teachings with awakened insight,\nand also discern the appropriate methods,\ncultivating wisdom and singular focus.\nOnly through extraordinary devotion\ncan one achieve extraordinary results.\nThrough prolonged diligence and suffering,\none may finally attain success.\nOtherwise, one will merely chase empty reputations,\nleaving no trace,\nor perhaps encounter a divine adept who grants it.\nBeyond this, all efforts are but futile labor—\nbetter to indulge in fine wine and pure silk instead.\n\nI am no pioneer of this knowledge,\nbut a humble servant to the learned,\nhaving spent years in bitter toil,\nlistening attentively to these truths.\n\nThe *Kǎnlǐ* (坎卦, *Water Hexagram*) and *Lǐqǔ* (离卦, *Fire Hexagram*)\nare the foundations of the elixir.\n\n*Cinnabar* (朱砂, *Zhūshā*) belongs to the Southern Fire position,\nyet it inherently contains *mercury* (水银, *shuǐyín*).\n*Black lead* (黑铅, *hēiqiān*) is of the Northern Water,\nyet it inherently contains *silver* (银, *yín*).\n\nSilver is the essence within lead,\nand mercury is the treasure within cinnabar.\nOnce the essence and treasure are distinguished,\neach returns to its original root—\nthus, they are named *Qīnglóng* (青龙, *Green Dragon*) and *Báihǔ* (白虎, *White Tiger*).\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Use lead, yet not lead; its meaning is clear.\"*\nBased on this, *white mercury* (白银, *báiyín*) is the supreme essence of lead,\nand *mercury* (水银, *shuǐyín*) is the true treasure of cinnabar.\nIf one were to use silver and mercury as elixir ingredients,\nthere would be no proper principle to follow.\nThus, the scripture states:\n*\"If seeking silver within lead,\none’s hair will turn white before graying.\"*\nThis refers to ordinary silver in the world—\nhow could it suffice as a medicinal?\n\nAgain, if one uses lead and mercury,\nit is utterly impractical—\nfar from the Dao.\nThis must be carefully reconsidered.\n\nAnother doctrine claims:\n*\"The one that holds mercury is not genuine.\"*\nAnother states:\n*\"Lead that holds mercury is not genuine.\"*\nYet another asserts:\n*\"Within lead, there is true lead.\"*\nAnd another says:\n*\"Lead from Jiāzhōu (嘉州) can subdue mercury,\nmaking it stand firm and dry.\"*\n\nBut truly, those who practice the elixir\nmust select renowned mountains and auspicious lands.\nIf not, malevolent spirits may dwell there,\nunwilling to bless the virtuous,\noften causing practitioners’ intentions to falter.\nThe selection of like-minded companions\nshould be limited to three or two at most—\ntoo many may lead to discord in heart and mind,\ndamaging the elixir and wasting effort.\nOne must also choose favorable times and auspicious days,\nobserving prohibitions as outlined in\n*The Essentials of the Three Caverns* (《三洞要筹宝经》).\n\nExternally, one must abandon worldly dust,\ninternally, extinguish impure thoughts.\nRegulate and harmonize one’s disposition,\nso that spirit and **qi** remain tranquil—\nno agitation or labor should be permitted.\nAvoid consuming meat or blood,\nviewing corpses or filth,\nsharing meals with women,\nor allowing hunger, satiety, joy, or anger\nto cloud one’s clarity.\nMeals must be taken at noon,\nsleep must begin with the head facing south,\nand one must bathe every seven days.\nAvoid fraternizing with outsiders or engaging in profane discussions—\notherwise, the vital essence will not be preserved.\n\nOn the day of refining the elixir,\none must prepare a single declaration,\nrecording one’s native place, surname, age,\nmonth, day, and birth hour,\nconcluding thus:\n*\"I, a vulgar man of [place],\ndesire to extend my remaining life,\nand to forge the true elixir.\nNow, having prepared the master and minister ingredients,\nI beseech the Spirit Lord,\nI beseech the Spirit God, the Sovereign of Supreme Unity,\nand the Four Directions’ Great Deities,\nto descend upon this humble offering.\n\nI invite the Four Directions’ Gods,\nbeginning from the hour of noon,\neach calling their own name, quality, and hue,\nconforming to their original essence,\nreciting twenty-four times with clenched teeth.\nI chant:\n*'I forge the spirit elixir,\nthe Spirit Lord descends to the altar.\nMaster of the Elixir Lord,\ndo not scatter and fly to the heavens.'*\n\nAgain, I chant:\n*'I forge the spirit elixir,\nthe Spirit God descends to the altar.\nPreserver of the Elixir Spirit,\ndo not be lost in the

and wisdom,\nand also purify their body and mind,\nchoosing a suitable dwelling,\navoiding filth and decay.\nThe impurities of life and death,\nif encountered, will defile the spirit elixir—\nthis must be strictly avoided.\n\nThe elixir, once obtained,\nmust not be revealed to others—\neven spirits cannot endure it.\n\nIn ancient times, elixirs were stored in brocade pouches,\nand the pills must be an odd number—\nnever even, lest they vanish.\nThe brocade repels malevolence.\n\n---\n**Golden Flower Reversion Elixir Method** (金花还丹方):\n*Black lead* (铅, *qiān*) – 8 *liǎng* (两)\n*Mercury*

weak, self-humbling.\n*Copper* with *suppressed cinnabar* (伏雌) grows to resemble the *Celestial Male* (帝男) over time.\n\n*Realgar* (雄黄) also holds this truth.\nThese four—*realgar* (雄), *cinnabar* (雌), *sulfur* (硫), and *orpiment* (砒)—\nare the true count of *male* and *female* yellows.\n\nSome say: *\"Flying Sand\"* (飞砂) as a single substance,\nafter ninety-nine revolutions (至九九八十一转),\nbecomes an elixir.\nTaking one pill and placing it in the mouth of the deceased,\nthey revive instantly.\nIndeed, the power of *orpiment* is beyond comprehension.\n\nSince it resembles *realgar*,\nit should also overcome the *Five Armies* (五兵),\nslaying serpents and *huī* (虺).\nWhen ingested as a medicine,\nit ascends to the brain,\ngranting eternal life and immortality—\nthis is the natural order.\n\nRecently, I observed Master Wang Huàn (王涣) overseeing affairs,\nas he mixed *realgar* (雄黄) and *mercury* (汞),\ngrinding them tirelessly in an iron mortar (铁铛子).\nHe applied gentle *Wén* fire (文火),\nwithout using a *fire polisher* (火玲).\nYet still, the transformation succeeded:\nWithin a day, it congealed into sand,\nand the *suppressed fire* (伏火) yielded grains as large as *soapnut* (皂荚子),\nshining like pure gold.\n\nIf *realgar* is unavailable,\nuse *high-grade Lìzhōu orpiment* (上色澧州砒黄) as a substitute—\nits efficacy is no weaker.\nThis is a *spiritual medicine* (灵药).\n\nAnother account states:\n*Realgar* (雄) as the sovereign,\n*cinnabar* (雌) as the minister,\n*sulfur* (流) as the messenger,\nand *orpiment* (砒) as the general.\n\nAccording to the *Bencǎo* (本草, *Compendium of Materia Medica*),\n*realgar* grows in *Wǔdū* (武都),\nand when combined with copper, it transmutes into gold.\n*Orpiment* behaves similarly.\n*Jìhuáng* (础黄) appears in many places,\nbut none compare to that of *Lìzhōu*.\n\n*Realgar* bears a hue like a *rooster’s comb* (鸡冠),\nglowing red when exposed to sunlight,\ncompact yet smooth, soft yet firm,\nwith a lingering, fragrant vapor.\nIt does not blend with *Kūn* yellow (昆黄),\nbut its core is a deep red,\ntinged with yellow—\nthus it is called *realgar*.\n\nEven if washed with water,\nonce dried and heated for a single cycle (一炊),\nit will produce *yellow coating* (黄衣).\nIf that fails,\nsimply holding it in the mouth will suffice—\nit will still yield *yellow coating* (黄衣).\n\nWhen a venomous serpent sees it, it dies instantly.\nThis is the true substance.\n\n*Realgar* also grows in *Jiānyáng* (隽州) of *Lìngnán* (岭南),\nbut none compare to that of *Wǔdū*.\n\n*Orpiment* (砒黄), though inferior to *realgar*,\ndoes not exhibit the same transformations.\nIts yellow hue is bright and clear,\nits edges sharp and rigid,\nwith a lingering *imperial qi* (皇气),\nand the redder and more easily shattered, the better.\n\nThe Dao/Way of *Dānyáng* (丹阳) is most difficult to grasp in this world.\nThough many study it, few truly comprehend.\n\nMoreover, the nature of *Dānyáng* is hard to soften—\nits outer radiance (晕) is red,\nits inner core is green and black.\nIron absorbs the *Yīn-Dīng* (阴丁) *qi* of the southern lands,\ncongealing into form, hence its red.\nCopper absorbs the *Yī-Jīn* (乙阴) *qi* of the east,\ncongealing into essence, hence its green.\nSilver absorbs the *Zǔ-Yīn* (卒阴) spirit of the west,\ncongealing into substance, hence its white.\nLead and tin both absorb the *Rén-Gùì* (壬癸) *qi* of the north,\nhence their black.\nGold absorbs the *Yī-Jǐ* (阴已) essence of the central realm,\nhence its yellow.\nIt is most difficult to refine and govern.\n\nSome say: *Radiance* (晕) is copper, copper is *radiance*.\nWhen one is exhausted, the other is exhausted—\nno one but a skilled artisan can harmonize them.\n\nThe *child-mother* (子母) alchemy unites their natures,\ndistinguishing between firm and yielding.\nThen one must use *hidden-fire lead* (伏火铅) and *mercury* (汞),\nupper *Dānyáng* elixir and upper *Yào* (药),\nto transmute their essence.\n\nAgain, the five metals buried underground for a thousand years,\nonly gold and silver retain their original essence—\nthe rest all turn to ash.\n\nThis method of mine has extracted and refined their essence,\nunaltered by fire or decayed by earth,\nmaking them capable of transformation—\ncrafting *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳), how could this be easy?\n\nIf one’s bones are the *immortal materials* (仙材),\nand one’s fate predestined by the *hosting of past lives* (宿命),\nthen early encountering the *divine secret* (灵诀),\nand refining with the *sacred blade* (刀圭)—\none *liǎng* (两) weighs twenty-four *zhǔ* (铢),\nand six *sù* (粟) make one *Dāogùi* (刀圭).\n\nOr, one may scrape and apply the *elixir* (药) onto a crucible’s rod (埚挺),\ninsert it into the flames,\nand it will become true treasure.\n\nThis is the supreme alchemy of the *Immortal Dao* (神仙),\nnot easily known by those who act hastily.\n\nIf one is not of this tradition,\none must meticulously study the principles of substances,\nconsult widely among alchemical texts,\ndiscern the hierarchy of *master-servant* (君臣),\nand know their prohibitions.\n\nIts *Yào* (药) has firm and yielding qualities,\nmethods of suppression and concealment,\nrepelling fire and hidden fire,\ndistinct uses when raw and when refined—\nsometimes employing lead and mercury together,\nsometimes using only the four *huáng* (黄).\n\nThe teachings of the *Immortal Dao* (神仙流) encompass myriad methods and countless formulas,\nall concealed and never fully revealed.\nEven if alchemical texts are passed down,\nthey are transmitted in confusion,\nand most later scholars achieve nothing.\n\nThis is because the wise do not diligently refine their understanding,\nnor grasp the *saintly intent* (圣意).\nTheir applications are shallow and ineffective.\n\nThey also lack full mastery of crucibles, furnaces, tongs, and sheaths,\nand do not probe the subtleties of burning, casting, and refining.\nIn the furnace’s flames, they rush past the critical moment—\nhow could they witness success?\n\nUsing refined *Yào* (药) is somewhat easier,\nbut raw *Yào* is far more difficult.\nThis method employs only raw *Yào*,\ntransmuting their essence into truth,\ndepending on precise timing—\nstopping and starting, extracting and inserting—\nthe seasons are key,\nand it also resolves the auxiliary lead and mercury.\n\nThe *Classics* state:\n*A vessel with an internal diameter of one inch*\ncan hold *mercury* of one *jīn* (斤).\nAgain, by measure:\n*A gold cube of one inch*\nweighs one *jīn*,\n*a silver cube of one inch*\nweighs fourteen *liǎng* (两).\n*Lead and tin cubes of one inch*\nweigh nine *liǎng* (两) and a half,\n*iron cubes of one inch*\nweigh six *liǎng*,\n*jade cubes of one inch*\nweigh nine *liǎng* (一本云玉重十两).\n*White stone cubes of one inch*\nweigh three *liǎng*,\n*earth cubes of one inch*\nweigh two *liǎng*.\nEach substance naturally absorbs its own *qi*.\n\n*Mercury* absorbs the *five heavenly spirits* (五阳神) of the most refined essence,\nunmatched in comparison.\nThe rest vary greatly—\nonly refined copper and silver are somewhat similar in weight,\ntheir forms soft and yielding, nearly equal in flexibility.\n\n*Xu* (徐) has a single *radiance* (晕) hue,\nwhile the others resemble one another—\nindeed, they can all be transmuted.\n\nMoreover, the *Five Metals Secret* (《五金诀》) states:\n*The power of realgar* can transmute iron,\n*the power of orpiment* (雌黄) can transmute tin,\n*the power of orpiment* (砒黄) can transmute copper,\n*sulfur* (硫黄) can transmute silver into mercury.\nThe four *huáng* (黄) can also reverse iron into copper,\nreverse copper into silver,\nreverse silver into gold—\nlike grain turning into rice,\nthis is the natural Dao/Way of heaven and earth.\n\nMagnetite attracts needles,\namber picks up dust—\nhow could these be other spirits?\n\nAgain, the *Classics* say:\n*Only those who master the Dao/Way and its techniques*\ncan refine and govern with ease,\nskillfully combining them,\nand thus create true treasure.\n\nThis method of mine transmutes iron into copper,\nand orpiment into silver—\nthe principle is identical.\n\nThe formula is as follows:\n\n**Refining *Dānyáng* (丹阳) Method**\nThirty *liǎng* (两) of *orpiment* (砒黄) from *Lìzhōu*,\nfree of mixed stones,\nas red as a *parrot’s crest* (鹦冠),\nand glowing brightest in sunlight—\nthis is the finest.\n*Orpiment* from other regions is inferior.\n\nEight *liǎng* of *orpiment* (雌黄) in the form of gold leaves—\nthe best.\nIf it is yellow and soft like stone, it is unfit.\nIf it contains mixed *realgar*, even if similar,\nthis method does not use it.\n\nTwo *liǎng* of *Hútóng* (胡同) *lǜ* (律), using stone *lǜ* resembling ginger root in form,\nsteeped in strong vinegar until it boils without settling.\n\nTwo *liǎng* of salt, roasted with *huā* (花) until its color changes.\n\nThese four ingredients total forty-two *liǎng*.\n\nFirst, take *orpiment* the size of small dates,\ngrind it finely,\nand weigh precisely thirty *liǎng*.\nPlace it in an iron pan (铁铛).\nFor every *jīn* of *Yào* (药),\nuse five *shāng* (升) of raw sesame oil,\nand simmer it gently over low fire,\nallowing it to bubble softly—\ndo not let the flames rage fiercely.\n\nDo this for nine days and nine nights.\nIf the oil becomes too thick,\ndraw it off and replace it with fresh oil,\nuntil the nine days are complete.\nThen transfer it into a silk pouch,\nand place it within a meal,\nensuring the pouch is fully buried in the grain.\nSteam it in the center of the rice for seven days—\nthe oil’s grease will seep into the sand,\nand the *orpiment* will become fresh and crimson.\n\nThe *Classics* state:\n*Imperial Male* (帝男) and *Imperial Female* (帝女),\n*Imperial Female* (雌黄) *orpiment* must be refined thus—\nfirst, to remove its toxicity.\nWhen the toxicity is gone, it can be combined with the five metals.\nSecond, it yields *frost* (霜) in abundance.\n\nIf the *orpiment* is of the highest quality,\nuse the inferior—\nworried that it may contain stubborn stones—\nsimply draw off the oil once,\nand use the purified residue—\nthis is also excellent.\n\n*Orpiment* from *Lìzhōu* is the most potent,\nwhile that from other regions is lesser.\n*Orpiment* (雌黄) should be refined like *Dānyáng*,\nbut during cooking, it must not share the same vessel as the others.\nThe rest follows the same principle.\n\nIts nature is exceedingly capable of softening substances, its efficacy matching that of *orpiment* in achieving results.\n\nThe *Jīnlíngzi* says: When steaming, even if placed together within the sand and rice, so long as they are kept apart, there will be no obstruction.\n\nAccording to the *Lead and Tin Classic* (《铅锡经》):\nTake three parts *cinnabar* (朱砂) and one part *realgar* (雄黄), grind them together and place in a copper basin. Add strong vinegar gradually while simmering over boiling water until the vinegar is exhausted, then replenish it. Repeat this process during the three *dog days* (三伏) until dry.\n\nRemove it and place in an oil wok, cooking over slow fire until the oil bubbles like fish eyes (鱼眼沸). After two *dog days*, extract the flying essence—this is excellent.\n\nIf it does not fly, mix with egg white and clay in a sealed earthenware vessel, place in a sand-rice bag, and steam for one *watch* (周时). This is also excellent.\n\nIf not, mix with red salt and apply to copper to produce gold. The rest follows the original text.\n\n*Hu Tóng Lǜ*’s true method is difficult to obtain.\n\nOne method says: Use it raw alone, applying to copper to produce white gold.\n\nBut if boiled in a porcelain vessel with water, continuously adding until five *sheng* (升) are used, it can remove black stains.\n\nOne version says: Do not boil—use it raw, and it will still work.\n\nSalt should be stir-fried until yellow. If used urgently, without boiling or steaming, it will still suffice.\n\nPowdered salt is inferior to grain salt, grain salt to well-washed salt, and well-washed salt to pond salt.\n\nHowever, take the three substances first, sift them through *yánshā* (岩砂), and mix evenly. Add them to vinegar to dissolve, then stir into the previous medicine until moist. Dry in the sun, then knead thoroughly until well-amalgamated.\n\nRepeat the mixing once more, dry in the sun until slightly damp, then place in the crucible.\n\nOne method says to mix with mulberry ash juice instead. If using vinegar, fear is that it may damage the copper. The method is unclear.\n\nDivide the medicine into two crucibles. Each crucible should hold no more than about twenty *liang* (两)—this is the proper measure.\n\nTake two spoonfuls of lime, mix with the previous medicine, and blend evenly. Spread lime thickly at the bottom of the crucible—at least one *fen* (分) deep—then press the mixture in firmly.\n\nPlace the previous powdered medicine inside, shaping it like the back of a hoe, without pressing hard against the furnace walls. Use a spoon to gently press, then cover lightly with two spoonfuls. Break the surface with the palm to let it merge with the lime, pressing lightly with the spoon until it resembles a hoe shape again.\n\nCover with an additional two *fen* of lime. Press gently to settle, then sprinkle a little water on top until it is just damp. Cover with a basin—slightly taller than the usual one and fifteen *cun* (寸) high.\n\nBurn with alternating gentle and strong fires for two *dog days*. Compared to the usual flying frost method, the fire should be slightly gentler.\n\nWhen cool, open it—the frost should have settled entirely on the furnace surface, with none remaining at the bottom. It will be white, soft, fine, and smooth, like powder when rubbed on the arm.\n\nThe frost that congeals inside the furnace forms a single mass, about one *cun* thick, with striations like bundled silk. It does not fly up into the basin. This is called *external furnace frost* (外炉霜).\n\nSeparately, there will be about half a *liang* that has flown onto the basin, differing in color—collect this separately for other uses.\n\nIf the fire is misjudged and the frost does not fully fly, repeat the process as before.\n\nThis *external furnace frost* is exceptionally effective at softening substances, unlike the brittle hardness of ordinary frost.\n\nOther methods mention flying white frost once, which loses efficacy if used sparingly and causes hardness if overused—this is a major flaw. This frost, however, can be used in any quantity without causing hardness, differing fundamentally from others.\n\nAs for *orpiment*, only the best should be used after reverse extraction. If boiled in oil or steamed, the flying frost can also be applied.\n\nFurthermore, *Kǒng Shì*’s calculations also state: Using white frost once is ideal. These two methods are highly consistent.\n\nAfter producing the *coiled furnace frost* (卧炉霜), take the previous frost, applying two *liang* per *jin* (斤).\n\nAll measurements should use large *jin* and *liang*.\n\nAfter refining *Dānyáng* (丹阳) as per the text, divide it into two crucibles, each holding only eight *liang*—neither too much nor too little, for excess or deficiency will cause drying.\n\nFor every *liang* of medicine, form six pills. For each application, insert three pills, waiting until the gold liquid flows like water. Pierce the crucible to the bottom with an object, then let it drain completely. Stir with charcoal twenty to thirty times, then add more medicine.\n\nRepeat this process similarly, pouring the mixture into a *Huá Píng* (华池) to disperse as pearls. If used urgently, break them with willow branches—even if they do not form pearls, it is acceptable.\n\nAgain, insert three pills as before, adding them to the *Huá Píng* until the color turns white.\n\nUnlike the applied medicine, this does not require heating—simply apply it to the substance, and it will whiten. A second application is needed to ensure full whitening.\n\nApplying raw medicine to a crucible is difficult; the dosage must be precise, ensuring the heat and medicine interact properly, with the gold liquid entering and exiting the crucible smoothly.\n\nRepeat this process carefully, as losses will be significant. The crucible should be slightly deeper.\n\nIf the gold liquid can be made to flow like water upon application, this is the superior method.\n\n*End of Volume One of the Dragon-Tiger Elixir Secrets*\n*Volume Two of the Dragon-Tiger Elixir Secrets*\n*Narrated by Jīnlíngzi*\n\nAccording to the Daoist scriptures, there are *huáng yín* (yellow silver), *bái jīn* (white gold), and *hóng yín* (red silver)—these are the products of the highest elixirs. One is called *hóng jīn* (red gold), another *hóng xiān jīn* (red fresh gold). There is also *lí jǐ jīn* (separated self-gold), *qīng jīn* (blue gold), and *bǎo jīn* (treasure gold), as well as *dān shā sì huáng* (cinnabar’s four yellows) staining mercury-silver, and *huáng huā yín* (yellow-flowered silver).\n\nMoreover, mercury-silver undergoes myriad transformations, inherently containing these stains. If further dyed, it may turn yellow, red, purple, or crimson—its hue shifts with the alchemical agent.\n\nSome appear as blood-wrapped, resembling *dì huáng* (rehmannia) roots. Others shine like the sun—neither truly yellow, red, nor purple, yet bearing traces of each. These are the refined elixirs of the immortals; mortal perception cannot fully discern them. Their methods and secrets are now recorded here.\n\nTo forge *hóng yín* (red silver), cinnabar is refined into powder, then mixed with mercury, *qīng lǜ* (green vitriol), *shí dǎn* (stone gall), and other alchemical sulfates. The mixture is sealed in an iron vessel and boiled until solidified, yielding a substance resembling *dān yáng* (cinnabar’s lustrous form), with a faint iridescent sheen. Yet even this can be refined to eliminate the iridescence.\n\nThis art holds profound mysteries beyond mere observation. Some masters achieve equal weight of product to input—one *jīn* (catty) yields one *jīn*, one *liǎng* (ounce) yields one *liǎng*. Some require no prolonged boiling, forming silver-like bodies instantly. Others employ cyclical refining, or produce structures without iridescence upon solidification. Some even craft silver vessels from the refined silver itself, using unadulterated elixirs and forgoing iron tools.\n\nAnother method begins with one *liǎng* of mercury, solidified into grains. A porcelain bowl is placed on the ground, and the grains are pressed together—within moments, they harden. An iron pestle is then used to crush them, and another *liǎng* of mercury is added. The mixture is recompressed in the bowl, hardening again. This process repeats, doubling the mercury each time—one *liǎng*, then two, then four, up to a hundred *jīn*, all completed in a single day through countless techniques and elixirs.\n\nThe Dao is profound and distant; its subtle principles defy full comprehension. These methods unfold with practice—never hastily grasped.\n\nThe refined silver of the **Liǎng** of **Jìnxīn** and **Shìnxīn** states also has a mine, whose nature resembles **Guāngmíng Shā** (光明砂). Its hue is red-purple, vivid and pleasing, fit for furnace use. When smelted and cast, it becomes pure white silver, yielding fourteen or fifteen **liǎng** per **jīn**, a rarity indeed.\n\nIn modern times, such methods are scarcely found in ancient Daoist alchemical texts, and their details remain unclear.\n\nSome suspect it is the red ore of silver, where red silver—when refined with **qīnglǜ** (青绿, *orpiment*), **dǎnzǐ** (胆子, *verdigris*), and other **fán** (矾, *alum*)—yields four or five **liǎng**, or even six or seven, with a color like **Dānyáng** (丹阳, *cinnabar*). Yet when mercury and these minerals are boiled together in iron vessels, they solidify into red silver. For every **jīn** of mercury and ore cast, only four **liǎng** of red silver emerge—this is merely iron, not mercury itself.\n\nOthers claim **dǎnzǐ** and **qīnglǜ** are merely **tóngmiáo** (铜苗, *copper essence*), containing iron rather than copper, which is why mercury can extract it. Yet this is not related to alchemical processes. The four **liǎng** obtained are iron extracted by mercury, not a product of the elixir.\n\nI have weighed these minerals carefully and recorded their true nature. When boiling and refining in a single crucible, lacking five **liǎng** of red silver, only four and a half emerge—proving they are all iron, without deception.\n\nMoreover, when refining **shāzǐ** (砂子, *mercury ore*), if the vessel is completely filled and the fire too fierce, the mercury will flee in fine, needle-like threads, imperceptible to the eye. Those who fail to notice this will lose everything without knowing why.\n\nEven when using elixirs to wash and refine, the ore may dissolve slightly, turning to dust or ash, carried away by the liquid. If not properly managed, this loss will accumulate, and the mercury will fully transform into red silver.\n\nLater scholars, seeing no results, abandon the method entirely, all assuming it is merely mercury—yet they are mistaken. Another tradition holds that even a **jīn** of mercury yields only iron, and iron naturally has an iridescence. When mixed with **qīnglǜ** and other dyes, it retains this flaw, making refinement difficult—no different from copper.\n\nModern practitioners of alchemical **Dào** (道, *Way*) find this method arduous and thus neglect it. Yet I have deeply studied and refined this technique, and it proves most worthy.\n\nIndeed, mercury extracts only the purest essence of iron. If one claims mercury remains unchanged, they stray far from the Dao. If instead one seeks iron’s essence, it is the finest iron of all. When cast into mirrors, it produces mirrors of superior clarity, far surpassing ordinary ones—evidence of its purity.\n\nHow else does one know this? Mercury is the most potent of all, capable of purifying impurities. When it interacts with these minerals, they are all refined into the quintessence of the five metals.\n\nUpon refining, the crucible’s iron surface is undamaged, not even a hair’s breadth lost. Later, through the elixir’s power, mercury draws the iron’s essence, merging with it in a manner so wondrous that it defies explanation. When used to cast mirrors, it becomes an object beyond ordinary comprehension.\n\nYet today’s practitioners dismiss it as mere mercury, unaware of its iron essence. I lament my own shallow skill and inadequate understanding of **Huángdì**’s (黄帝, *Yellow Emperor*) methods. If I were to apply **jīn gāo** (金膏, *gold ointment*) and **xiónghuáng** (雄黄, *realgar*), refining it as per the ancient formulas, its brilliance would rival that of a **yīngwǔ** (鹦鹉, *parrot’s feather*—a fine, lustrous cinnabar), surpassing even the mirrors of antiquity.\n\nNow, if cast into bronze, it would still produce iron of the highest grade transformed into copper. Yet today’s scholars call it only **hóngyín** (红银, *red silver*), seeing its iridescence and treating it like common copper, unaware that it is the refined essence of the five metals.\n\nI consider **hóngyín** (red silver) as both iron and copper, and the method of turning iron into silver through mercury. With the formulas perfected, the principles are now clear.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar into Red Silver:**\nTake **zhūshā** (朱砂, *cinnabar*) one **jīn**, preferably of bright hue and not needing to be granulated. Place it into **cāizhǐ** (猜脂, *a type of animal fat or wax*), mix with water, and boil for thirty-five days. Then immerse it in **mìshuǐ** (蜜水, *honey water*) and boil for another fifteen days.\n\nNext, transfer it to the **Huápó** (华池, *Refined Pool*—likely a mercury solution). After seven days, melt **qiān** (铅, *lead*) in a **gāntǔ** (甘土, *sweet clay*) crucible, pour it into the mixture, and add the **zhūshā**, wrapped in **fánní** (矾泥, *alum clay*). Stir until it sinks to the bottom, then subdue it in fire for seven days.\n\nUpon adding **chìtǔ** (赤土, *red earth*), **huángfán** (黄矾, *yellow alum*), and **zhuōshā** (硵砂, *a type of sulfur or alum*), the color emerges, forming **hóngyín** (红银, *red silver*), also called **hóngjīn** (红金, *red gold*). Its exterior is white, while its interior glows faintly red, radiant and attractive.\n\n**Another Method:**\nTake **shuǐyín** (水银, *mercury*) one **jīn**, and burn **shǐliúhuáng** (石硫黄, *sulfur*) into sand without further refining or washing. Crush the sand and place it in a double-layered silk bag, then wrap it again in a bamboo mesh sack.\n\nExtract the juice of **sānghuī** (桑灰, *mulberry ash*) and **chìwūzuǒ** (赤乌左味, *a type of red medicinal substance*). Suspend the bag in the liquid, ensuring it does not touch the bottom. Add **huángdān** (黄丹, *yellow realgar*) one **jīn**, and refine with gentle fire like the eye of a fish for seven days.\n\nLater, smelt the contents in a crucible, and they will all turn into **hóngyín** (红银, *red silver*), resembling peach blossoms, vivid and pleasing.\n\n**Method for Refining Green into Red Silver:**\nGreen minerals come in many varieties, with **zāngqīng** (曾青, *a type of verdigris*) being the finest. Its form is like **huánglián** (黄连, *coptis*), or small **guàn xiǎo zhēnzhū** (贯小真珠, *strung pearls*), one to three inches long, sometimes paired in twos or threes, either straight or curved, deep or bright green, often with golden threads coiled within, shimmering like fine silk.\n\n**Jùróng** (句容) mountains yield this, though it is now exceedingly rare and costs more than gold. Its hollow variety comes from **Zǐzhōu** (梓州), with a central cavity, its color a vivid, bright green, and its interior containing water.\n\nThe **Kūnlún** (昆仑) **tóuqīng** (头青, *head green*) resembles **yángméi** (杨梅, *wax myrtle*), with a jagged peak, large specimens like small shot, and a solid core.\n\nThe green minerals of **Jùróng** and **Zǐzhōu** can be broken into fragments like shattered bowls, their color a plain green without luster. Even these can be selected and used.\n\n「Moreover, there is **bái gānqīng** (白甘青, *white ganqing*), which grows in sweet soil, its color fresh and green, as large as a bean, slightly soft, and can be broken with a fingernail—its fracture reveals an even fresher green. This single substance is called *white ganqīng* by the local people; neither ancient Daoist prescriptions nor the *Běn cǎo* (本草, *Fundamental Herbal*) records mention it.\n\nThere are also **cháng piānqīng** (长偏青, *long-biased green*), **bái qīng** (白青, *white green*), **yú mù** (鱼目, *fish-eye green*), and **shàn qīng** (善青, *fine green*) in powder form, all from **Ráo xìn** (饶信, *Raoxin*) and similar regions, resembling one another and also akin to the *ganqing* above.\n\nNow, the method for **jié shāzi** (结砂子, *congealed sand method*) uses this: **bái shànqīng** (白善青, *white fine green*) one pound, powdered; **shí nǎo** (石脑, *stone brain*) half a pound, cooked in vinegar; and **shuǐ yín** (水银, *mercury*) one pound. Mix these ingredients thoroughly in vinegar paste, then place in a flat-bottomed wok over gentle fire until the *yú mù* (鱼目) has settled below the boiling point. Gradually add more vinegar paste and water, ensuring it does not boil, and let it simmer for one *fú* (伏, *double-hour*). When done, it will all congeal into sand.\n\nAlternatively, one can add water to the wok’s mixture and boil it vigorously for three days, yielding an even finer result. The substance will also become slightly more translucent.\n\nHowever, one may directly extract **shēng gǔ zhù** (生鼓铸, *raw congealed mercury*), producing about six *liǎng* (两, *troy ounces*) of **hóng yín** (红银, *red mercury*). Generally, when using *qīng* (青, *green minerals*), one does not mix in **shí dǎn** (石胆, *stone gall*), **tǔ lǜ** (土绿, *earth green*), etc., as this slightly reduces its potency.\n\nAnother method:\nTake **qīng** (青, *green minerals*) two *liǎng* (两, *troy ounces*) of the finer variety, **bái fán** (白矾, *white alum*) six *liǎng*, **jùróng dǎnzi** (句容胆子, *Jùróng stone gall*) six *liǎng*, and **shuǐ yín** (水银, *mercury*) one pound. Grind all into fine powder, mix with mercury, and follow the usual method to congeal it. Then add **hēi dòu pí** (黑豆皮, *black soybean husks*) four *liǎng* to ensure the final product has no translucence.\n\nFor **qīnghuā jié shāzi** (青花结砂子, *blue-green congealed sand method*):\nTake **qīnghuā** (青花, *blue-green flower*) one pound and **bái fán** (白矾, *white alum*) four *liǎng*. First mix these evenly, then take two spoonfuls and thoroughly grind them with mercury. Place in the wok and boil vigorously until it reaches thirty to fifty bubbles. Remove, wash once, and let the patterns fully settle. Directly extract the **shēng gǔ zhù** (生鼓铸, *raw congealed mercury*), yielding a very faint red hue.\n\nThe method for **shí dǎn hóng yín** (石胆红银, *stone gall red mercury*):\n**Shí dǎn** (石胆, *stone gall*) grows naturally in the valleys of **Púzhōu** (蒲州). Its form resembles a broken comb, with a shallow, pale green color. When burned, it turns white—this is the true variety.\n\nThe inferior kind comes from **Xuānrùn** (宣润) and similar regions, where its juice is extracted and refined through boiling. The superior grade is a bright green, forming blocks or flakes of varying quality. The lower grade resembles damp yellow mud, known as **ní dǎn** (泥胆, *mud gall*), and can only be mixed with mercury and burned into powder.\n\nThe **Xuānzhōu** (宣州) variety is not as potent as **Jùróng** (句容). Their *qi* (气) and efficacy differ greatly—the **Jùróng** (句容) type is ten times stronger.\n\nThe finest **Jùróng** (句容) **shí dǎn** (石胆) resembles shattered tiles, is dense and heavy, with a vivid green hue half-tinged in deep emerald. It is highly prized, unaffected by summer heat or wind exposure.\n\nThe **Púzhōu** (蒲州) variety is commonly used for the *jié shāzi* (结砂子) method. Even the mid-grade and below can be utilized.\n\nThere are also naturally occurring specimens found in mountain valleys or caverns, their color slightly paler than those refined through boiling. They form flakes or blocks, but such discoveries are rare.\n\nRecently, merchants have produced counterfeit **shí dǎn** (石胆). They mix **tài yīn xuàn jīng** (太阴玄精, *Great Yin Mysterious Purity*) with **Jùróng** (句容) varieties, then boil them in copper vessels to simulate **Púzhōu** (蒲州) **shí dǎn** (石胆).\n\nThe **Jùróng** (句容) variety has also been adulterated by adding **Xuānzhōu** (宣州) types and reboiling, altering its form and color. These fakes are very difficult to distinguish, so one must examine them carefully.\n\n**Qīng fán** (青矾, *green alum*), also called **lǜ fán** (绿矾, *green alum*) or **zào fán** (皂矾, *soap alum*), originates from **Tàiyuán** (太原). It surpasses the efficacy of **Xuānzhōu** (宣州) alum.\n\nThe **Dao** (道) of refining sand is profound and subtle. Even pure **tǔ lǜ** (土绿, *earth green*) can be praised in song by **Xú zhēnjūn** (徐真君, *Master Xu of Truth*) from **Tiān mù** (天目). His song goes:」\n\nThe white pearl in jade waters boils in the even pan,\nAs martial and civil voices softly rise to grandeur.\n\nOne *fú* of three *shí* yields half-death,\nTwice steamed overnight, it turns to copper.\n\nThe general must wield his sword at dawn,\nLet not the child with the green waist scorn it.\n\nWhite frost on stone ever slays,\nWhile yellow alum’s stone-bile has ever been resplendent.\n\nIron crucibles and clay pots—both martial and civil—\nMust be boiled through five *shí* in one night.\n\nOpen the box to reveal the jade, burn incense,\nFor immortals who encounter it shall be long-lived.\n\n**Method for Congealing Stone-Bile Sand:**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n- **Jùróng** (句容) stone-bile: 1 *jīn* (斤)\n- Mercury: 1 *jīn* (斤)\n\n*Procedure:*\nTake a flat-bottomed pan, holding five or six *shēng* (升), or one *dòu* (斗) or less.\nScrub the pan’s interior thoroughly with pumice or stone all day until its surface is spotlessly white.\nSelect the smoothest, flattest section of the pan’s base—this is easiest to polish—*never* allow oil or grease to remain.\nIf using an old pan, first burn it until it glows like fire, then polish and wash it.\n\nSubmerge the mercury to a depth of half an inch or more, ensuring it can fully contain the medicine—*do not* let it be too deep.\nAdd the medicine in two *liǎng* (两) portions, in whole chunks (do not crush), placing them atop the mercury.\nApply gentle, fish-eye heat until the water boils, then simmer.\nIf the water is insufficient, ladle in hot water to disperse the heat.\nLet it boil for two full cookings (*zhuō*), then remove the sand—*one batch yields two liǎng or more*.\n*Strive for vigorous, unremitting refinement.*\n\nRepeat this process until the medicine is exhausted.\n\n「The medicine takes one full cooking to congeal, after which it can be refined, though it is generally better to let it settle longer.\n\nFor *jùróng* (句容) mercury, two *liǎng* (两) portions are added per batch, which is acceptable.\n\nWhen the medicine is abundant, the sand yield is likewise greater. The secret lies in this: the water must be shallow, and the fire gentle—this is the key to success.\n\nThis method employs only pure water, no other medicines. The congealing happens as it is prepared, differing from other methods, and is truly superior.\n\nTo begin, blow gently across the water’s surface until it ripples, then watch as the mercury spreads evenly, like a thin pancake covering the base of the pan.\n\nWhen heating, pay close attention as the mercury rises straight up to the pan’s four sides—this proves the medicine’s *virtue/power* (气) has transformed it.\n\nWhen collecting the sand, use a porcelain shard to scrape the bottom of the pan thoroughly, gathering it batch by batch until all is exhausted. If using a *tiàozi* (跳子) sieve, refining mid-process is also effective.\n\nAnother account states: At first, the stone *dǎn* (胆) sand must exhibit a *yùn* (晕) glow. Simply rinse and wash it with warm water to purify it; avoid mixing it with other medicines when boiling. If other medicines are added, their colors will cling to the sand’s original *yùn*, and the goal will not be achieved—do not use it lightly.\n\nIf boiling is necessary, only white alum may be added, and it must be done in a porcelain vessel.\n\n**Method for refining stone *dǎn* (胆) sand:**\nTake *jùróng* mercury (胆子) one *jīn* (斤), alum one *dàhé* (大合), and mercury one *jīn*—all mixed and ground until no stars remain. Place in the pan with seven-tenths of a *hé* (合) of water and boil gently until it reaches the point of effervescence.\n\nThen transfer to a sand pan, using a single *sīn* (筋) branch to allow ventilation. Periodically add water to the sand pan, letting it drip slowly until the water disperses. After two days, six *liǎng* (两) or more of sand should be obtained.\n\nIf an additional half *jīn* (斤) or even one *jīn* is used, take the previously refined sand and congeal it again, retaining the earlier medicine broth for repeated boiling. After two successive refinings, add the broth to fresh water and boil for three more days—this is even more refined.\n\nThe sand will yield twice as much, but the *yùn* (晕) glow will be lighter, with one batch producing a clear *yùn*.\n\nThe secret states: If stone *dǎn* (胆) sand has been refined, re-boiling it with fresh stone *dǎn* (胆) can remove the *yùn* (晕), proving that deeper refinement through repeated boiling and congealing is truly marvelous.\n\n**Method for refining mercury sand:**\nTake ten *jīn* (斤) of *Xuānzhōu* stone *dǎn* (胆). If the mercury is not fully refined, add three to five *jīn* more. The method remains unchanged, using only stone *dǎn* (胆)—no other medicines. If other medicines are added, the *yùn* (晕) will be harder to remove, and the refined sand will not differ from the usual method.\n\nOnce all is refined, take the sand and refine it vigorously to remove any impurities, ensuring it is fully pure.\n\nBoil it with *bámò* (拔莫) root for two to three days—it will turn the color of coarse paper. Then add yellow earth and boil again for two to three days—it will become as white as snow, retaining traces of mercury, resembling three stages of refinement.\n\nThe first is called *jījié* (鸡厥), where the root nodes do not align, and the stems are long and thick. The second is *kǔzhàng* (苦杖), with sparse, coarse leaves—these are useless. The *bámò* (拔莫) root is slightly tighter, with fine nodes that align, round leaves, and short, slender sprouts. This medicine’s *yùn* (晕) glow is unmatched, and it congeals perfectly.\n\nI once saw this root refined at the same time, and the sand turned white immediately. Even more, when boiling this medicine, only the stone *dǎn* (胆) *yùn* (晕) appears—other medicines do not correspond.\n\nAnother account says: First, boil the *bámò* (拔莫) root in a separate vessel to make it thick and concentrated, then add it to the boiling sand—this is also effective.\n\nOne text states: Boiling for a month guarantees whiteness.\n\nAnother account says: The *jīngāng* (金刚) root from silver mines, which is red, and the vines that are three to five *chǐ* (尺) tall, possess the function of controlling mercury. Known as *yínmiáo* (银苗), it grows on silver mountains—this is the best.\n\nFor every *jīn* (斤) of refined sand, including the post-refining re-boiling, sixteen *jīn* of the vine are used. After boiling, the vine is fried and steeped for three days, then left to rest near the fire. The method for steeping the medicine broth uses pure water from *Chìwū* (赤乌), along with one *jīn* of yellow alum. The two are mixed and ground thoroughly for use.\n\n**Method for congealing mercury with stone *dǎn* (胆):**\nThis method, along with *zhuǎndǎn* (转胆子) for red silver, is recorded here.\n\nTake one *liǎng* (两) of mercury and one *liǎng* of stone *dǎn* (胆), along with two *hé* (合) of the previous medicine, and mix them. Boil gently with fire for half a day.\n\nThen add half a *liǎng* of stone *dǎn* (胆) powder, gradually introducing rice vinegar while boiling—*do not* let it boil over. Continuously refine and collect the sand until the mercury is fully exhausted.\n\nAgain, boil the sand with five *liǎng* of stone *dǎn* (胆) powder for five days and nights—when complete, the medicine will resemble tea powder. One *liǎng* of powder can congeal three *liǎng* of mercury into sand.\n\nIf prepared as medicine for seven days, one *liǎng* of powder can congeal four *liǎng* of mercury. On the twelfth day, one *liǎng* of powder can congeal seven *liǎng* of mercury.\n\nThe fire may be slightly more intense once the sand has formed—if the sand is already refined, even a quicker flame poses no harm.\n\n**Method for refining red silver with *tǔlǜ* (土绿):**\nThere are several kinds of *tǔlǜ* (土绿). Found in *Xuānzhōu* (宣州), *Ráoxìn* (饶信州), and *Dàoyǒng* (道永) mountainous regions, it grows wherever copper is present.\n\nDig it from copper pits, where it is unearthed from the soil. After exposure to rain, it grows, appearing soft and pale, like crumbled *húfěn* (胡粉, orpiment). The best is when it crumbles to powder with a touch; the second-best is when it is hard like soft stone.\n\nIn the north, it resembles settled green rice flour—soft, fine, and without residue—and has a pleasing hue.\n\n**Refining red silver sand with *tǔlǜ* (土绿):**\nFor *Dàoyǒng* (道永) *tǔlǜ* (土绿), use half a *jīn* (斤) of the soft variety, or slightly more. Take two *liǎng* (两) of alum, four *liǎng* of white alum, and one *jīn* of mercury—first grind the alum with rice vinegar, then mix and grind the mercury thoroughly until no stars remain.\n\nNext, use an iron spoon to transfer the mixture into the pan, spreading it like fish skin. Then lay a flat cloth at the bottom of the pan, leaving a one-inch gap in the center—*do not* let it touch.\n\nUse a vinegar-flavored paste to moisten the powder before boiling. Add two *liǎng* of white alum and one *liǎng* of salt, all ground into powder. After placing the cloth and medicine in the pan and adding water, sprinkle the powdered medicine evenly atop the mercury mixture. The water level should barely submerge the mixture by one finger’s breadth. Apply a fire just below the gentle *yúyǎn* (鱼眼, fish-eye) heat, ensuring the pan’s base remains warm enough to hold by hand.»\n\nAfter half a day, gradually increase the fire so that it is like the small fish-eye below, sparse and flickering. Another half day of gentle heat, then gradually increase the fire again, keeping it constantly like a fish-eye. After half a day, add more fire and water to boil. After another half day, when the heat reaches two *fú* (伏, layers of heat), the mixture will become sand-like.\n\nOne method states: when it first congeals, take three or two *liǎng* (两) of the congealed sand, crush it into small pieces, and scatter them into the pan. Initially, this causes a hook-like reaction. Once all the sand has formed, lay it at the bottom of the pan, adding one *jīn* (斤) or half a *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), and boil it for another day or two. The yield of sand will double, and the darkening around its edges will fade.\n\nAnother method says: simply use the congealed medicine liquid from before—do not discard it, but collect and boil it again to form sand, which is also said to double in quantity, and the darkening will fade.\n\nAll of this is then transferred to a mortar for grinding. Rinse with water to extract the pure essence, repeatedly pounding until you obtain ten *liǎng* of refined sand.\n\nThe method for forming sand-like *hóng yín* (红银, red silver) originates from Master Liu. Use *qīng fán* (青矾, green vitriol) five *liǎng*, the finest from the Northern lands, one *jīn* of mercury, and one *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar). The Northern *tǔ lǜ* resembles settled green rice flour in texture, soft and fine, with no impurities.\n\nTake these ingredients, place them in a mortar, grind with vinegar until thoroughly mixed, and transfer to a new pan. The pan should not be scoured or polished. Boil with intense fire (*wǔ huǒ*, 武火) for one *fú*, until it becomes dry sand, with no trace of mercury residue. At this point, you should have twenty *liǎng* of sand.\n\nNext, take this sand and place it in a sand basin, adding white alum to boil for a day. Then grind it with *bàng fěn* (蚌粉, mother-of-pearl powder), rinsing three times. Mix again with alum and grind for half a day, then boil with white alum and *wū méi* (乌梅, black plum) for a day. Finally, boil with *sāng táng* (砂糖, rock sugar) for a day and with *zào jiá* (皂荚, soapberry) for another day. After each step, grind and rinse out the black impurities until it is completely pure.\n\nAdd one *liǎng* of *huáng dān* (黄丹, litharge), then grind together. After grinding, parch and refine it again, then add one *liǎng* of frost (*shuāng*, 霜), grinding until thoroughly mixed. Divide into sixteen portions, wrap each with salt, and pierce them into small conical shapes (*xiǎo kǒu zǐ*, 小孔子). Dry them under the sun until completely desiccated. Place them in a furnace or on a pan, covering with ash. Initially, nurture with gentle heat for a day, then apply intense fire, heating the crucible’s base until it turns red. Once cooled, the frost within will dissolve, leaving only the mercury. Collect the sand-like globules (*qiú zǐ*, 球子) from the pan, yielding four *liǎng* of red silver.\n\nThis is the common grade—its color fades by half, and when struck, it makes no sound, being very soft. When ignited, it emits only a faint, shallow smoke.\n\nThe revered teacher said: the frost generated within the globules causes the sand to fully congeal, becoming as white as jade. This is the supreme grade of the Daoist elixir.\n\nThe method for forming sand-like red silver:\nTake one *jīn* of *niè shā* (硵砂, calcined realgar), one *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), and one *jīn* of white alum. Grind these three ingredients together, place them in a bottle, and seal with a thin layer of alum paste. Nurture and heat for one *fú*. When nearly finished, apply a strong fire to complete the process. Use one *dǒu* (斗) of wind-sifted ash and one *dǒu* of *chì wū* (赤乌, red crow medicine, possibly red lead or cinnabar), mix with vinegar paste and water to dissolve the ash, then strain to obtain clear lime water. Boil the lime water until hot, pour over the *chì wū*, and extract the liquid to refine the sand.\n\nThe mercury should first be treated with ten *liǎng* of refined medicine, ground and placed in the pan, congealed for one *fú*. Once all the salt residue is exhausted, transfer it to the pan and use the same method as forming sand, but even more refined. Stir it occasionally without overdoing so.\n\nAfter one *fú*, it will fully congeal into sand, with no trace of raw mercury. Rinse again, then add four or five *liǎng* of refined medicine, congealing it repeatedly until fully refined—this is beyond description.\n\nFor each *jīn* of this, add four *liǎng* of white lead (*bái qiān*, 白铅), stir and refine in a crucible, pour into a mold, and flatten it into a *tuó* (砣, pestle). Then place the pestle in ash and burn it fiercely, using a bellows to blow as well. This should be shaped into a perforated lead mold (*kǒng lòu kuàng qiān*, 孔镂铿铅), poured into the ash, leaving only the red silver.\n\nRefine it again in a crucible, pour lead into the crucible to thin it, and then strain it through ash three times. The lead will be fully exhausted, leaving only the red silver. Rinse it again in a crucible with *bì tǔ* (壁土, furnace clay) and a little salt, then strain and remove the remaining lead, which will be clean.\n\nThe darkening will be minimal, and the substance very soft. Another method states: mix this with *dān yáng* (丹阳, possibly a type of cinnabar or red lead) and silver, in a ratio of three parts to one, and it will be even better.\n\nThe method for white lead (*bái qiān*):\nTake one *jīn* of lead, mix with two *jīn* of raw *sōng zhī* (松脂, pine resin). Parch the lead with intense fire until it becomes liquid, then add a small amount of resin and a little salt, stirring thoroughly. Continue adding resin and alum until the resin is evenly distributed throughout the lead, which should now be entirely transformed into ash powder. This can then be used as a measure (*dù*, 度). Place it in a sweet crucible, pound into liquid, and you will obtain over ten *liǎng* of white lead, resembling snow.\n\nThe method for forming sand:\nTake one *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), five *liǎng* of white alum, and five *hé* (合) of alum. Grind all together, mix with one *jīn* of fine yellow soil and *zhǐ sīn* (纸筋, paper fiber) to form a paste, and shape it into a box about two *cùn* (寸) thick. Wrap the previous mixture inside this box, allowing it to dry gradually, then bake with intense fire without breaking the box.\n\nWhen cooled, it will turn a purple-red color and yield one *jīn* of sand. Grind the mercury together with it for an hour, stirring continuously. This medicine can be repeatedly used to form sand in quantities of ten *jīn* or twenty *jīn*. Each *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* can be divided into two, with the box of yellow soil as the standard.\n\nThe *Huá Chí* (华池) method: mix stone lime with good wine and stir thoroughly, using it like a thin pancake.\n\nAnother method states: whenever forming sand with *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), mix it with yellow soil to congeal.\n\nAnother prescription:\nTake two *jīn* of *tǔ gōng* (土汞, calx of mercury), and eight *liǎng* of white alum. Grind them together, then add two *shēng* (升) of rice vinegar, sprinkling it gradually while parching until fully refined. If no rice vinegar is available, use good bran vinegar instead. Grind the mixture into powder, then take half of it and mix with one *jīn* of mercury, grinding until thoroughly combined. Place it in a flat-bottomed pan, keeping it submerged in vinegar paste to a depth of one *cùn* (寸). Boil like a fish-eye until it reaches a rolling boil for half a day, and it will fully congeal into sand, with no trace of raw mercury remaining.\n\nIf no brine is available, mix vinegar with water instead.\n\nOnce refined, take the sand again and, following the previous method, add one *jīn* of medicine, blending and grinding thoroughly. Cook and congeal it as before—it also requires half a day.\n\nThen sift and wash until pure, and extract the *shēngshēng* (生生, vital essence) by pounding and casting. The yield will be about seven *liǎng* (两), which is excellent.\n\nThis is not the common method.\n\n**Prescription for Congealing Sand:**\n\nTake approximately three *dǒu* (斗) of mulberry twig ash, sift with bamboo grass through hot water, and collect three *dǒu* of the heavier sediment, roughly equivalent to two large *dǒu* in volume, each weighing eight *jīn* (斤).\nIf the lumps are too large, break them into the size of a *dànzi* (弹子, marble), but do not grind them finely—fear that the sediment will not pass through the sifting, making it difficult to refine.\nThe ash should be sifted through hot water until the liquid turns a deep red—this is not acceptable. If it turns a greenish hue, it is suitable for use.\n\nUse this liquid to sift the ash, and place three *shēng* (升) of mercury in a crucible, cooking it for three days. Add the liquid to soak it repeatedly, as in the usual method, but ensure it is tightly sealed.\nThen apply *píhuáng fēishuāng* (砒黄飞霜, arsenic sublimate) three times, mixing it with mercury.\nTake a bamboo tube, remove its skin, and cut it into strips about two sheets of paper thick, with a length of over three *cùn* (寸).\nPour the prepared ash liquid into the tube, filling it completely, and also fill a flat-bottomed pan with the same liquid. If the liquid in the tube turns black, pour it out.\nRepeat this process three times—even with bitter vinegar, the same method applies.\nSift the stone lime (石灰) through hot water to obtain a clear liquid as before.\nMix it with bitter vinegar, following the method of *sìshén dān* (四神丹, Four Spirits Pill) sublimation, until a frost forms.\n\nUse *tǎiyáng* (太阳, cinnabar), *tǎiyīn* (太阴, realgar), *xuánjīng* (玄精, refined realgar), and *huángfán shí* (黄矾石, yellow alum) that resembles gold in color—all of the highest quality.\nUse *qīngshā* (硵砂, green arsenic) that is blackish-green—also of the highest quality.\nCombine these five ingredients into a powder, place them in a mortar, and pound them finely. Spread the powder around the edges of a secondary pan, about the thickness of a grain of rice, and cover the center similarly.\nUse charcoal to seal and roast it for one *fúshí* (伏时, hour), with a ratio of eight parts gentle fire to four parts strong fire. Do not exceed one *jīn* of charcoal—if done too quickly, it will not be usable.\nOnce frost is obtained and it turns white, soften it with fire, then twist it into strips as thick as two sheets of paper. Wrap these strips around the upper material to form pills, each the size of a small *dànzi* (弹子, marble).\nThen use five *hé* (合) of lime to create a pool, with six *shēng* (升) or more. Place the pills in a crucible and melt them, adding them to the pool until three pills are immersed per batch. Repeat this process five times.\n\nAfterward, use *bóshàng kè* (博上克, refined borax) to mark the surface, creating a mold. Apply oil to smooth it, ensuring it is very moist and can be easily removed.\nIt is also said: First, add the refined white alum ash as a marvelous aid.\nThe method involves burning a pit with mulberry wood, sweeping it thoroughly clean, mixing the lime with bitter vinegar, and while it is still hot, placing dry alum in the pit to cover it. Seal it tightly.\nWhen the *líng* (玲, condensation) opens, add one *liǎng* (两) to every *jīn* (斤). First, roast it in a pan until dry, then place it in the pit for softening before applying the frost—do not form pills.\n\n**Prescription for Congealing Red Silver:**\n\nTake five *liǎng* (两) of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), preferably green and soft, such that when rubbed between the hands it feels like *húfěn* (胡粉, powdered lead).\nAlso take five *liǎng* (两) or more of white alum.\nAnd half a *jīn* (斤) or less of *chìwū* (赤乌, red arsenic)—also acceptable.\n\nCombine one *jīn* (斤) of mercury with these ingredients, blending and grinding thoroughly. Place the mixture in a pan and cook it with gentle fire for half a day until noon, when the full heat is applied. It will congeal into sand.\nThen, extract the *shēngshēng* (生生, vital essence) by pounding and casting—only about four *liǎng* (两) will be obtained.\n\nBefore casting, lay a layer of salt in the bottom of the pan, about one *cùn* (寸) thick. Spread the finely ground white alum powder in the center of the salt, sparingly. Wrap the sand in thin silk, twisting it so that it adheres to the salt. Once the silk is just wrapped around the sand, stop—do not let it remain loose.\nPlace the pan inside another, then cover the sand with another layer of salt-wrapped silk. Immediately stir the salt, pressing it down to form a tight crust. Roast it with strong fire for half a day.\n\n**Later Method:**\n\nTake one *jīn* (斤) of mercury,\nsix *liǎng* (两) of *lǜzi* (绿子, green arsenic),\nand two *liǎng* (两) of *chìshí zhī* (赤石脂, red pitchstone).\nAdd two *liǎng* (两) of lead (铅), which should be added gradually.\n\nGrind these three ingredients together in a mortar with a small amount of salt, pounding them about a hundred times.\nWhen the pan boils, use an iron spoon to stir the mixture down into it. Cook with strong fire from the *yín* (寅, 3 AM) hour until the *chén* (辰, 7 AM) hour, and the silver threads will be obtained.\nFor one *jīn* (斤) of mercury, add one *liǎng* (两) of *huángdān* (黄丹, cinnabar), parch and grind it together. Extract the *shēngshēng* (生生, vital essence) immediately after.\n\n**Method for Extracting Mercury by Sublimation:**\n\nTake the sand and place it in a crucible with *hánshuǐ shí* (寒水石, alum) as a barrier, but keep the layer thin. If the sand touches the alum, layer them thickly.\nCover the top with salt, and then with ash.\nSeal it tightly and sublimate with gentle and strong fire until the bottom of the crucible is reached.\nThe alum must then be burned once more with fire, turning it completely red. Immediately remove it from the fire, cover it with a basin, and seal the edges.\nWhen the *líng* (玲, condensation) opens, it will be ready for use.\n\n**Method for Casting Sand:**\n\nTake a crucible and place the sand at its base. Pour a thin layer of moistened liquid over it, filling the crucible completely and pressing it down tightly. Then roast it by the fire until the liquid is dry.\nPlace the crucible over a bottle mouth in a pit on the ground, with a small amount of water inside. Seal it with sinew and clay, gradually increasing the heat until the crucible is heated. Apply a strong fire, then quickly remove it when the condensation opens.\n\nIn general, after casting the sand, the extracted vital mercury (*shēngshēng*, 生生) should first be boiled with vinegar.\nThen, wash it with warm vinegar and warm water, and finally grind it with salt to achieve the proper sequence.\n\n**Prescription for Red Arsenic Sand:**\n\n*Chìwū* (赤乌, red arsenic) is the sediment of *níchūn* (腻粉, refined lead powder), originally made from mud gall and salt.\nThe *huáinán* (淮南, southern variety) is superior to the northern one, and fresh, good-quality material is best.\nIf it has been stored for a long time or left on the ground, its potency will be diminished. Each *dǒu* (斗) should weigh eight *jīn* (斤).\nThe tightly compacted variety is superior.\n\nTake any quantity of *chìwū* (赤乌), place it in a large porcelain container filled with boiling water, and stir it until evenly dispersed. Use a small wooden pestle to grind and stir it until smooth, then break it up in the hot water. Add it all together to the hot water.\nOnce it is completely dispersed into fine particles, immerse it in clear water—this will not hinder the process.\nFill the porcelain container and let it settle for one day and night; it will become clear.\nUse a tool to skim off the clear liquid on top—do not use the thick, turbid portion. Place it in a pot and boil for the duration of a meal. Then, with a thin-mouthed ladle at the bottom of the pot, scrape and collect the sand.\n\nThe sand resembles silkworm excrement (*cánshā* 蚕砂), being very light and soft. Place it in a single porcelain bowl, with a small amount of medicinal liquid in the bowl to nurture the sand. Skim it repeatedly until the liquid is exhausted.\n\nIf the broth in the pot is insufficient, add more, but also until it is exhausted. When the water in the bowl is depleted, add fresh water, stir thoroughly with a tool, and wait until it clarifies again before boiling. Even if some sand remains settled in the bowl, do not use it beyond its exhaustion.\n\nOnce all is collected, the broth in the pot will total only one or two *dǒu* (斗). Then extinguish the fire, remove the pot, and set it in a bright place. The sediment at the bottom of the pot is known as *rénxī* (人询), which should be gathered the following day, just like the earlier portion.\n\nAfter gathering all the sand, store it in a porcelain bottle. Reboil it with *chìwū* (赤乌) broth, simmering for four *fú* (伏) periods, stirring frequently. Once a day, grind and wash it. Then discard the remaining mercury (*tóng* 铜, here meaning *gōngtóng* 锌汞, \"quicksilver\") and collect the sand, which will be minimal.\n\nIf not ground and washed nor frequently stirred, but simply kept from settling, the sand will fully solidify. Another account states: When measuring the clear water, each *shēng* (升) weighs one *liǎng* (两). To prepare it later, first weigh the water, then take the *chìwū* clear water, and weigh it to determine the quantity.\n\nAnother method: Boil the sand with the concentrated broth for four *fú* periods, stirring it repeatedly and ensuring it never settles. The fire must be strong (*wǔ* 武). Every time one *fú* period passes, skim off the thick, impure, and old broth, then add fresh broth to continue boiling. When the boiling day is complete, bind the sand and let it dry, then weigh to know its quantity.\n\nAnother prescription reads: Boil the sand for four *fú* periods. The resulting *yùn* (晕, \"vaporous residue\") is taken—one *liǎng* (两) of this sand is added to two *liǎng* of mercury (*gōngtóng* 锌汞), cooked with *zàojiá méi* (皂荚梅浆, \"soapberry and plum juice\"), differing from other methods of producing *yùn*.\n\nIf no additional gold is desired, it is called *hóngjīn* (红金). The prescription states this method.\n\nAnother account says: Boil all the *chìwū* (赤乌) broth together in the pot, never skimming or scraping it. When the broth is exhausted in a day, the sand will naturally settle at the bottom of the pot, and you may collect it as you wish.\n\nWhen the broth has been boiled, place it in a ceramic basin (*wǎpén* 瓦盆). After a night, it will solidify into long, thick *xiāoshí* (消石, \"calcined alum\") rods, over a *chǐ* (尺) in length, as thick as two fingers, white in color, and with the same texture as *xiāoshí*. Even when exposed to wind, it will not dissolve or change. Some call it *báishídǎn* (白石胆, \"white stone gall\").\n\nIt is said that if the sand is solidified without any *yùn* (晕), it can also be used for refining.\n\nAgain, if the medicinal broth from previous boiling is used to paint on bricks or stones, it will appear as an empty green (*qīng* 青) color, remaining unchanged for a long time.\n\n**Method for Solidifying *Chìwū* Sand (赤乌砂子法)**\nTake two *dǒu* (斗) of *tīnggǔ* (厅谷) husks and layer them with *chìwū* (赤乌). Then press the *chìwū* with a small amount of husks, ensuring they are well-mixed. After one pressing and washing, it will settle like sediment (*tíng* 停). The next day, it will become mud (*ní* 泥).\n\nThe broth must be skimmed until fully exhausted, then separately clarified and set aside. The resulting solidified sand will have more *yùn* (晕), but it is unclear why.\n\nIn my opinion, it may be difficult to skim, so the previous method is preferable. Another thought: When mixing the sand earlier, add *jūróngdǎn* (句容胆子, \"Jurong stone gall\") during boiling. This should make it easier to solidify with less *yùn*, and *liáo* (寥) ash is also suitable—it is the finest method.\n\nSimply follow the earlier major method for boiling the sand, then boil it again with *liáo* ash—this is the superior approach.\n\nAnother account from an elder (*sùshàngrén* 宿上人) states: When boiling *chìwū* (赤乌), after one pressing, boil it at the bottom of the pot, collect the sand, and then place it in *chái* (柴) ash. Boil for three *fú* periods, and it will become excellent dry sand, yielding over ten *liǎng* (两) per *jīn* (斤). Later, *Cuī Zhōngshēng* (崔中丞) used this to craft gold instruments, obtaining over forty or fifty *liǎng* of sand at once. He then added it to gold in one go, successfully removing the impurities from the gold—an excellent result.\n\nThus, it is known that the earlier claim that this sand can be added to gold is not unfounded.\n\nThis substance is extremely soft, even softer than other red golds (*hóngjīn* 红金), and softer than gold and silver (*jīnyín* 金银).\n\nAnother method: Take three *jīn* (斤) of mercury (*gōngtóng* 锌汞), place it in a sand basin (*shāpénzi* 砂盆子), and mix with *chìwū* (赤乌) and concentrated vinegar (*niècuì* 酽醋). Grind it until it resembles *miǎn* (缅) paste. After two *chuāo* (炊) periods, do not apply fire. Instead, wash it with water, then add more *chìwū* (赤乌) and repeatedly grind with concentrated vinegar. When sand appears in the mercury, collect it until the quantity is sufficient.\n\nAfter thoroughly washing and purifying the sand, boil it with *gānzǐ* (甘子, \"sweet fruit\") and *gāncǎo* (甘草, \"licorice root\"), then remove the *yùn* (晕) and any toxicity. It will yield *yín gāo* (银膏, \"silver paste\").\n\n**Method for Boiling and Solidifying Sand (燠伏砂子法)**\nFor all types of sand, when one *jīn* (斤) of mercury (*gōngtóng* 锌汞) is solidified, the more *fú* (伏) periods used in boiling, the less *yùn* (晕) there will be. This makes refinement easier, and the usual amount is four *liǎng* (两) or less. If one can solidify seven or eight *liǎng* (两) or more, it is truly masterful.\n\nIf skilled in boiling and solidifying, and further refining the mercury, the quantity will increase, or it may become fully solidified, containing no *yùn*—this is the essence of boiling and solidifying.\n\nAnother method: Take sand that requires full solidification, place it in a silk or bamboo mesh bag (*zhǔlǚdài* 疏袋), and boil it with clear *chìwū* (赤乌) water, adding four *liǎng* (两) of *huángdān* (黄丹, \"yellow cinnabar\"). Boil it for seven days.\n\nThen add *chìwū* (赤乌) and simmer until it forms a white *dǎnzi* (胆子, \"stone gall\") for refining. Leave it to solidify for seven days, then fully solidify it with fire—no need to extract the raw material.\n\nAnother method for fully solidifying sand: Take one *jīn* (斤) of raw mercury (*tǔgōngtóng* 土汞) and half a *jīn* of *dǎnzi* (胆子). After solidifying, use the resulting mercury to mix with a small amount of *liáo* (寥) ash, kneading it into a paste for refining. Fix it in a pan (*chēng* 铛) and roast for ten days until fully solidified.\n\nAnother method:\n*Liáo* (寥) ash – one *jīn* (斤)\n*Xiāoshí* (消石) – four *liǎng* (两)\n*Báifàn* (白矾) – four *liǎng* (两)\nCombine these ingredients in a bottle and ignite them until they melt (*róng* 镕).\n\nAfter cooling, take five *liǎng* (两) of *fánshí* (矾石, \"alum stone\") and one *liǎng* (两) of *mìtuó sēng* (蜜陀僧, \"mellite or honeyed alum\"). Mix these and ignite with strong fire (*wǔhuǒ* 武火) for one *fú* period.\n\nThen take the previous mixture, add five *liǎng* (两) of *císhí* (磁石, \"lodestone\"), and knead it into a paste for refining. Roast with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for seven days—this is the finest method.\n\n「If salt is not to be used with *gǔyán* (鼓盐), then this salt, when made into a paste, should first be thoroughly dried over a fire. For each *jīn* (斤) of salt, add five *liǎng* (两) of *fúhuǒ xiāoshí* (伏火消石, \"roasted alumstone\"). In an iron mortar, grind it finely like flour—ensure it is ground to a smooth paste before forming the mixture; there is no need to use *gǔyán* (鼓盐) in this case. Additionally, if the *liáo* (寥) ash is roasted until it turns red, it is superior.\n\nAnother method:\nTake the *yún* (晕, \"haloed\") residue, empty it, and boil it in a solution of *báifàn* (白矾, \"alum\") for the duration of a meal. Then, when refining into silver, it will naturally soften and turn red at the bottom of the pan (*chēng* 铛).\n\nFirst, spread the salt to a thickness of over one *cùn* (寸). Then, finely grind *báifàn* (白矾) powder and sprinkle a little at the center of the *liáo* (寥). Wrap the sand in thin silk, gently twist it to adhere to the wrapped silk, and stop once fully wrapped—ensure no excess silk remains. Even if the refining is complete, place the wrapped sand on the *báifàn* (白矾), covering the silk with a little more *báifàn* (白矾). Quickly remove the salt, unfold the wrapped silk, cover it with a frost basin, and seal it tightly with an iron clamp to ensure no leaks. If the *gǒng* (汞, \"mercury\") force rises and there is any sign of leakage, the mercury will escape. Use strong fire (*wǔhuǒ* 武火) and burn fiercely—this is optimal. From dawn until dusk, remove the fire and wait for it to cool. The basin should contain frost and mercury mixed together. Then, remove the salt and collect the purple powder (*zǐfěn* 紫粉). Strike it with an object to produce a metallic sound—it is then ready for use in the furnace.\n\n**Method for Extracting Red Silver Halo (*hóngyín yún* 红银晕):**\nObtaining red silver halo is extremely difficult. Why? The materials used are not of the highest quality. Even those skilled in refining lead and mercury (*qiān gǒng* 铅汞) may have slight discrepancies in their techniques, let alone attempting to use ordinary stones and herbs as medicines—where raw and processed materials differ so greatly—yet hoping to transform the mundane into the true. How could this not be difficult?\n\nNow, when using these methods, one must carefully distinguish impurities, understand their nature, and measure the ingredients precisely—whether in sequence or proportion. If the process aligns with principle, it will not differ from the genuine. The slightest deviation will lead to failure. Students must study this thoroughly and apply it carefully.\n\n**Method for Washing and Refining Sand Halo (*shāzi yún* 砂子晕):**\nAll colored sands must not be washed with cold water; warm water should be used instead. Avoid mixing with other medicines during grinding, washing, or boiling, as external medicines may bind the sand halo, making extraction even more difficult. First, empty the sand and wash it with warm water—repeat this process several times. Then, add salt and rice gruel, grinding it thoroughly. Use barley grain broth, *wūméi* (乌梅, \"black plum\"), and *liáo* (寥) ash, storing it in a large porcelain container over a chaff fire for ten days until thoroughly decomposed. Before use, add *zhānglù gēn* (章陆根, \"stem of *Achyranthes bidentata*\") and boil the sand until it reaches the desired consistency. After this, it can be used in any refining process.\n\n**Method for Extracting Red Silver Sand Halo (*hóngyín shāzi yún* 红银砂子晕):**\nTake washed sand, shape it into small rods, and place wind-dissolved lime (*fēnghuà shuǐhuā* 风化石灰) in an iron crucible. Insert the rods into the lime and seal the crucible—it may also be left unsealed. Refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for one month or more. After pounding, each *jīn* (斤) yields ten *liǎng* (两) of pure, halo-free product.\n\n**Method for Reviving Halo from Raw Mercury (*chōushēng chūyún* 抽生出晕):**\nTake sand and mix it with two *liǎng* (两) of *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石, \"cold water stone\"), one *liǎng* (两) of *fánshí* (矾石, \"alum stone\"), and one *liǎng* (两) of *zhānglù gēn* (章陆根, \"stem of *Achyranthes bidentata*\") per *jīn* (斤) of sand. Grind them thoroughly together for three to five meals' duration—the more grinding, the better. Wash and repeat the process with the same three ingredients twice more. The halo should now be fully extracted. Then, regenerate the raw mercury (*shēng gǒng* 生汞) and mix it with *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石) paste in the pan (*chēng* 铛), using vinegar as a binder. Place a half-*cùn* (寸) layer of *hánshuǐshí* at the bottom and a one-*cùn* (寸) layer on top, with the sand sandwiched between layers of *hánshuǐshí* powder—or shape it into thin sheets if preferred. Cover with *liáo* (寥) ash and salt, then refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for one *fú* period. Afterward, place it in a crucible and melt it into the *hánshuǐshí* pool.\n\n**Method for Preparing the *Hánshuǐshí* Pool (*shí fǎ* 池法):**\nMix *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石) with saltwater into a paste like *miǎn* (缅, \"Myanmar\") glue, applying it in three layers until it turns as white as snow.\n\n**Method for Roasting *Hánshuǐshí* (烧寒水石法):**\nTake *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石), quickly remove it from the fire, seal the basin tightly, and wait for it to cool before use.\n\n**Method for Pointing Red Silver Halo (*diǎn hóngyín yún* 点红银晕):**\nOne *liǎng* (两) of toxic frost (*dú fēng* 毒霜) and half a *liǎng* (两) of *jùróng dǎnzi* (句容胆子, \"cholecyst from Jurong\")\nMix these finely.\n\nFirst, prepare lime by heating it as in the *lín huī* (淋灰, \"lime leaching\") method and leach it with white horse urine, obtaining about two *shāng* (升) of liquid. Place this in a porcelain bottle. Add the two ingredients, boil with strong fire (*wǔhuǒ* 武火) for two *fú* periods, then cool. Remove the residual liquid and impurities, mix with half a *liǎng* (两) of *fúhuǒ xiāoshí* (伏火消石, \"roasted alumstone\"), and knead into a paste. Place it in a medicine container and refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for two days. During refining, each *liǎng* (两) of medicine can treat one *jīn* (斤) of material like snow.\n\n**Medicine Container Method (*yàogū fǎ* 药柜法):**\nTwo *liǎng* (两) of raw *fánshí* (矾石, \"alum stone\"),\nHalf a *liǎng* (两) of *qīng* (青, \"indigo\" or \"blue vitriol\"),\nOne *liǎng* (两) of *mìtuó sēng* (蜜陀僧, \"mellite or honeyed alum\"),\nHalf a *liǎng* (两) of *jùróng dǎnzi* (句容胆子, \"cholecyst from Jurong\")\nMix these with vinegar and place them in a small porcelain bottle. Roast for seven days, adding vinegar daily before roasting. This mixture is then ready for use as a container. Repeated use over time improves its efficacy.\n\n**Method for Roasting *Xiāoshí* (伏消石法):**\nTake one *liǎng* (两) of *xiāoshí* (消石, \"alumstone\") and grind it into powder. Place it in a porcelain cup, pressing it flat. Sprinkle two *qián* (钱) of *liáo* (寥) ash on top and press it down evenly. Cover with a porcelain lid without sealing. Refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) until the *liáo* (寥) and *xiāoshí* (消石) juices are fully consumed—this completes the roasting.\n\n**Alternative Method for Pointing Red Silver Halo (*diǎn hóngyín yún* 点红银晕):**\nTake eight *liǎng* (两) of lead (*qiān* 铅) and two *liǎng* (两) of mercury (*shuǐyín* 水银), mix them thoroughly, and place them in a porcelain vessel without sealing. Refine with fire until they liquefy like water—do not overheat, only until they reach a liquid state. After ten days, grind into sand. Add *píhuáng* (砒黄, \"orpiment\") along with *xiāoshí* (消石), *báifàn* (白矾), and *liáo* (寥) to extract the halo, washing and grinding it twenty or more times. Then, boil it with halo-extraction medicine for a day, add half a *liǎng* (两) of mercury (*gǒng* 汞) to the lead, and refine with fire for another ten days.\n\nWhen the mixture is ready for application, blending with frost medicine is also excellent.\n\n**Method for Pointing Red Silver Halo (with Enhanced Whiteness):**\nUse high-quality *píhuáng* (orpiment) for coloring—if unavailable, substitute with aged rat poison. Line a container with ash half an inch thick, then cover with plaster two inches thick, and sublimate for three cycles.\n\nTake one *jīn* (斤) of white frost (*báishuāng*), four *liǎng* (两) of *fú* (伏, \"subdued\") *xiāoshí* (消石), and four *liǎng* (两) of *liúfú* (硫伏, \"subdued sulfur\"). Refine gradually over a day, extracting minimal sulfur. Ideally, let the sulfur subside within the *xiāoshí*.\n\nCombine these two substances, grind thoroughly until fully integrated, and spread evenly in a crucible. Cover with *xiāoshí* powder, sprinkling lightly by hand—use no more than half a *fēn* (分). Seal tightly and sublimate for one cycle. Two *liǎng* (两) will rise to the top; the rest remains below. Scrape down and regrind, then sublimate again. Repeat this process three times, each time ensuring the *xiāoshí* is fresh and refined under subdued fire.\n\nTake three *liǎng* (两) of *Xúzhōu shí nǎo* (徐州石脑, \"Xuzhou mineral essence\"), finely ground, and roast in an iron pan for one *shí* (食, \"meal\") duration—preferably in a copper vessel. Once the fire has fully subsided, immediately pour in five *hé* (合) of concentrated vinegar, stirring vigorously. This is called *cù shí nǎo* (醋石脑, \"vinegar-processed mineral essence\").\n\nQuickly add the subdued frost to the vinegar-processed essence, stirring over the fire until dry. Then take twelve *liǎng* (两) of fresh *xiāoshí* (previously refined under subdued fire), two *liǎng* (两) of *báifàn* (白矾), and grind them together in a bottle. Refine under subdued fire for ten days, heating from above. Finally, apply a single intense blast of fire to liquefy into a juice—now ready for application. For every four *liǎng* (两) of medicine, apply to one *jīn* (斤) of material. The supreme whiteness is achieved as per the *Chí Kǒu Jué* (池口诀, \"Pool-Mouth Secret\"):\n\n*\"The basin must be repeatedly tested with clear water.\"*\n\nIf the applied material turns white, for every *jīn* (斤), add four *liǎng* (两) of the base substance, mix thoroughly, and grind into a fine powder. Add to mercury until forming a paste, then refine until fully integrated. Take one *qián* (钱) of the subdued fire medicine, place in a sand basin, and boil with paste until dissolved. Strain, grind, and discard the black residue—repeat this process three times. By nightfall, reintroduce mercury and a small amount of medicine, dry-roast, and seal. After two days of boiling and two nights of dry-roasting, the result should be pure white with no halo. Test by burning a small amount—its behavior will confirm success.\n\n**Method for Subdued Fire Medicine:**\nFirst, take one *liǎng* (两) of *báifàn* (白矾) and three *fēn* (分) of *pǔ xiāo* (朴消, \"plain *xiāo*\"). Grind these two substances finely, place in a porcelain dish, and arrange as a crucible. Inside, place one *liǎng* (两) of *xiāoshí* powder. Refine gradually with gentle fire for a day, then increase the heat until the crucible glows red—stop immediately.\n\nTake one *liǎng* (两) of mercury, leaving one *fēn* (分) subdued. Combine these two substances, grinding until extremely fine—ideally, grind for an entire day, with meticulous effort yielding the best results. Add half a *liǎng* (两) of the previously subdued *báifàn* and other ingredients, then mix with the mercury medicine, grinding until fully refined.\n\nForm a crucible with *yánhuā* (盐花, \"salt flowers\"), using a bottle. The crucible should be one inch thick. Seal tightly and refine with gentle to vigorous fire for seven days—ten days is even better. Heat from above until the bottle glows red, then stop. The medicine will turn greenish-purple. This single crucible of medicine can transform ten *jīn* (斤) of sand into pure white.\n\nMaster Huò once prepared this method while at the *Lóngxīng Guàn* (龙兴观, \"Dragon Ascension Hall\") in Yángzhōu (扬州). He stated that the process should proceed as described.\n\n「The method of forming a crucible and removing the *yùn* (晕, \"haze/impurity\")—when the crucible rises and emits a faint haze:\n\n- **Lime (石灰):** 1 part\n- **Yellow soil (黄土):** 2 parts\n- **Salt (盐):** 1 part\n\nCombine these three ingredients to form the **crucible base (挺子)**. Use a stirring crucible (搅埚) and consider the base effective when it no longer emits haze upon heating. Once all haze has dissipated, the residue will be even more potent and can be used repeatedly without limit.\n\nLime is particularly effective in removing haze, but it is brittle and difficult to work with. If using a stirring crucible (搅埚), it is best to stir before adding the **primary substance (母)**. If the primary substance has already been added, stirring may risk damaging the silver.\n\nAnother method: Mix **talc powder (滑石末)** with vinegar (醋) and apply it to the crucible and the base (砣挺). Upon heating, the residue will burn away silently, effectively sealing the haze. A single application suffices—afterward, the haze will not reappear upon heating. It is advisable to conduct this process in a secluded room where no drafts (风) reach.\n\n**Method for removing haze from sand and other substances:**\n\nTake fine sand (砂子) and knead it thoroughly. Mix with **lodestone (磁石)**, **alum (消石)**, **white alum (白矾)**, **pumice (朴消)**, **salt (盐)**, **cold water stone (寒水石)**, and **mother-of-pearl (母蛎)**. Add a small amount of **sticky rice (糯米)** to form a paste, then grind and shape into a **pill (饼)**.\n\nWrap the sand in a layer of cloth (布), knead it until thin, then dig a hole two *chǐ* (尺) deep and bury it for **one hundred days (一百日)**—this will remove the haze. If the haze does not fully dissipate after one hundred days, burying it for a year or more is even better, until the haze is completely gone. Burying without the medicine is also acceptable.\n\nAnother method for **crucible bases (埚挺)**: Simply pound them thin and bury them—they will also lose their haze.\n\nThis is the method revered by **Mountain Master Li Jingyang (山人李景阳)**.\n\nAnother method:\nRefine **dragon liver (伏龙肝)**, lime (石灰), **mineral charcoal ash (矿炭灰)**, and **mulberry ash (桑灰)**. Boil until the mixture is white and free of haze.\n\nAnother method:\nUse the **residue of sweet persimmon (余甘子)** for boiling—it can effectively remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nWash the mixture with **limewater (石灰淋)** to eliminate the bitter taste of the ash.\n\nAnother method:\nSoak the mixture in water (浸), then boil (蒸) and wash (淋) repeatedly—no matter how many times, the purest result is best. Boil and wash in cycles of three to five times, then repeatedly grind and wash the sand with this ash, until it is completely free of haze.\n\nAnother method:\nIf the haze persists, boil the mixture again. Use **two *liǎng* (两) of refined cold water stone (寒水石)** to boil, as the resulting liquid will be deeply black—this indicates the haze has been removed. Test repeatedly until the mixture turns white. This method is derived from boiling **stone gall (石胆)** and **orpiment (砒黄)** together, though it is unclear whether other medicines can be similarly refined.\n\nAnother method:\nMix **two *liǎng* (两) of realgar (础黄)**, **two *liǎng* (两) of cold water stone (寒水石)**, and **one *liǎng* (两) of alum (盥)**, then boil. Do not use iron utensils—this yields the best results.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **alum (盥)** for three days, washing it daily until it produces a milky residue. The haze will then be completely removed.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil **aconite (附子)** in its raw form with the residue of **red silver (红银)** and **refined mercury (汞了)**. After three boilings, the haze will be eliminated.\n\nAnother method:\nUse **horse teeth juice (马齿汁)** to extract a concentrated decoction (煎取浓), then mix with **alum (消石)**, **pumice (朴消)**, and **sweet persimmon juice (甘子汁)**. Stir while heating the **red silver (红银)**. After three applications, the haze will be removed.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **hogweed root (章陆根)** with ginger (姜), then boil or wash to remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand in **limewater (石灰清)** extracted from **silkworm cocoon ash (蚕砂汁)**—this will eliminate haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand in **sesame oil (荏子油)** ten times to remove haze. Some say this method can specifically eliminate **iron haze (铁晕)**.\n\nAnother method:\nMix **refined red silver (红银)** with **refined mercury (汞了)** and boil with **raw aconite (生附子)**—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nCollect **urine from wine shop patrons (酒家酒客小便)** in a pool, then use it for boiling substances—this will remove haze. Some say the urine of **elderly men (老人尿)** is even more effective due to its prolonged storage.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand in a **sand basin (砂盆)** with **orpiment (砒黄)** and add **alum (盥)**. Do this for seven days or two cycles of seven days—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nMix **refined red silver (红银)** with **refined mercury (汞了)** and boil with **fennel (茴草)**—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand with **white plum (白梅)** to remove haze. Some say white plum is slightly more effective than **black plum (乌梅)**, and both should be used without their pits.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **yellow sprouts (黄芽)** and boil for seven days in a **sand basin (砂盆)**—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil with **bat guano (伏翼粪)**—this will remove haze.\n\n「Bat guano as well.  Another method:\nGrind **dried lotus root (梼莲子)** and **fennel (茴草)** juice into cakes, dry in shade, and store for later use. Boil and wash with it—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nEvery time you grind and wash sand, you must mix it with a small amount of **powdered clam shell (蚌粉)** and grind thoroughly—this is effective.\n\nAnother method:\nHold water in your mouth for a brief moment, then wash with your hands—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil **refined red silver (红银)** with sand and **pine resin (松脂)**—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **white willow root (白章柳根)**, **glue essence (胶清)**, **magnolia bark (朴消)**, and **lime (石灰)**, then boil—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nWrap **yellow soil (黄土)** and **stone gall (石胆)** in cloth and boil—this will remove haze, and it is very effective.\n\nAnother method:\nSteep **rotten hemp (烂蒸草)** in water, then strain—this will remove haze. It can also remove **Dan Yang haze (丹阳晕)**.\n\nAnother method:\nFor cases where **mercury (汞)** is mixed with much **flying mercury (飞汞)** at the bottom, mix **yellow soil (黄土)** and **alum (盥)**, grind into paste, wrap, and burn—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **cobaltite (钴羊角)** and **pinewood (松明木)**, stir in a crucible, and repeatedly rinse with water to collect the ash—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand in **rice husk ash (糠灰)** juice, frequently changing the liquid. After seven days, the haze will be gone. You must rinse and grind it six or seven times daily, always using warm juice for washing. After washing, let it settle.\n\nAnother method:\nPound **calcite (理石)** and **realgar (玄精)** equally into powder, then dissolve sand to make a solution and add it—this will remove haze. It is also effective for **Dan Yang haze (丹阳晕)**.\n\nAnother method:\nDissolve **refined red silver (红银)** thinly, or before it becomes granular, into **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)** juice—this will remove haze. Some say: boil **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)** to obtain **congealed ash (霜伏)**.\n\nAnother method:\nOnce sand has been ground into a paste like **silver ointment (银膏)**—mix it with **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)**, grind into powder, then boil with **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)** for half a day or more—it will be ready. Dry and crush it immediately; if there is a delay, stop the process. This ash is very effective at binding sand.\n\nAnother method:\nGenerally, mixing and grinding ash thoroughly is most effective against haze.\n\n**Master Kong’s (孔氏)** method for removing haze from sand and **refined red silver (红银)**:\nTake sand that has been thoroughly refined, two *jin* (斤). First, use warm **salt brine (盐浆)** water in a bowl, and grind and wash the sand with a **willowwood pestle (柳木槌)**, repeatedly submerging and rinsing the medicine. Wash it twenty times until it becomes white and pure.\n\nThen, break it up and place it in a **porcelain vessel (瓷器)**, and boil it in **glutinous rice (糯米)** brine. Add **two *sheng* (升) of *wu mei* (乌梅)** without pits. If you use **strong wine brine (酒家醇浆)** from an inn, it is also acceptable.\n\nBoil for two days, without adding any other medicines. Every day, wash and grind it four times, always using warm brine for the process. Do not use **cold water (玲水)** at any stage, before or after.\n\nWhen washing and grinding, add a small amount of **Barbary wolfberry (胡同律)**—one *qian* (钱) divided into four doses as a guideline. This **Barbary wolfberry (胡同律)** is suitable for both copper and iron, and very effective at removing haze.\n\nIf using **aged earthen wall soil (远年土壁土)** as a broth, it is also excellent.\n\nFor cases where **lime (石灰)** is used sparingly, place water in a bowl, and grind and wash the sand with a **willowwood pestle (柳木槌)**, repeatedly submerging and rinsing the medicine. Wash it twenty times.\n\nPut **brine (浆水)**—about half a bowl—into a **porcelain vessel (瓷器)** and immerse the sand. For every *jin* (斤) of sand, use **one *fen* (分) of *li* sand (硵砂)** in the brine. Place it in a warm spot, and after one *fu* (伏) time, the medicine will naturally appear.\n\nStir it with a **rake (篦)**, then wash and grind it with water, kneading by hand until it settles.\n\nThen, take a **large iron mortar (大铁臼)**, mix sand and **salt (盐)**—two *sheng* (升)—and grind with a strong man until it resembles **green mud (青泥)**. Every day, wash and grind it three times, mix with **alum (盥)**, and cast into a mold. Rinse with **urine ash (小便来灰)** juice and boil for one day.\n\nAgain, mix with **alum (盥)** and grind for one day, also three times daily. Change the **alum (盥)**, and boil again with **urine ash (小便灰)** juice for one day—this will be fully effective.\n\nIf you do not boil it again with **alum (盥)**, calculate three days of boiling, and it will be fully free of haze. Some say that after this process, **mercury (汞)** will also be easier to control.\n\nIf haze remains, boil the sand in **vinegar brine (醋浆)**. Add **two *liang* (两) of white alum (白矾)**, **two *liang* (两) of salt (盐)**, **two *sheng* (升) of *wu mei* (乌梅)**, and **two *liang* (两) of alum (寒水石)**—rinse thoroughly. You may also use **half *liang* (两) of orpiment (砒霜)**.\n\nFor **one *qian* (钱) of *li* sand (硵砂)**, use **two *liang* (两) of magnolia bark (朴消)** and **one tea bowl of finely ground white willow root (白章柳根)**. Boil for two days, rinsing the sand three times daily. Follow the previous method of grinding with **Barbary wolfberry (胡同律)** and using **aged earthen wall soil (壁土)** as a broth—this will remove all haze.\n\nIf haze persists, take sand and boil it with **two *liang* (两) each of *fu long* liver (伏龙肝)** and **white lead (白善)**, **one *fen* (分) of lime (石灰矿)**, and **two *liang* (两) of *meng* plant ash (梦灰)** and **urine ash (来灰)** for two days. Then, follow the previous method of washing and grinding—this will make the sand white and free of haze.\n\nIf haze still remains, for every *jin* (斤) of sand, add **one *liang* (两) of yellow cinnabar (黄丹)**. In a **porcelain vessel (瓷器)**, roast it over low heat until the sand is fully incorporated, then grind it. Add **one *jin* (斤) of sugar sand (砂糖)**, a small amount of water, and boil for one day—no rinsing needed. **Sugar sand (沙糖)** can remove **black haze (黑晕)**.\n\nIf you use **concentrated rice vinegar (浓米醋)**, or if you do not have **vinegar without dregs (无糠醋)**, add **soap pods (皂荚)** instead. Boil for two days—this can also remove **black haze (黑晕)**.\n\nThen, rinse and grind it repeatedly until it settles. When the day is complete,」\n\nA Method:\n\nAfter cooking, take the sand and form it into small pellets. Place wind-dissolved lime into the iron mortar, scatter the sand over it, and insert the pellets into the lime. Secure tightly and subject to fire-nurturing for one month.\n\nLater, pound it—it will be free of haze. For every *jin* of sand, yield fifteen *liang* or more. Dry the sand thoroughly.\n\nThe sand before and after must never be exposed to cold water. For every *jin* of sand, mix with one *liang* of *fúshuāng* (伏霜), grinding until fully incorporated. If *fúshuāng* is unavailable, raw *shuāng* (霜) may be used instead.\n\nDivide into sixteen pill-sized balls, coating them with salt. First, refine the salt finely, then wrap each ball in clay, sealing them individually. Pierce each ball with a pin, creating three to five small holes, and dry them. Place them in a crucible—an iron pan (*tǎng* 铛) may also be used. Cover with fine yellow earth or lime. Alternatively, spread charcoal ash on top, seal tightly, and nurture with gentle fire for one day. Gradually increase to strong fire until the crucible’s base glows red. Once cooled, open it and collect the vaporized mercury.\n\nIf mercury remains on the ash, collect it entirely. Leave the pan undisturbed, placing it horizontally over charcoal fire, and burn through with strong flame until fully red. Once cooled, break the balls, recover the sand, and mix with *wūméi* (乌梅), *bái fán* (白矾), and salt. Boil for half a day until dry. Add *níqiú yán* (泥球盐) and fire once more, then introduce the medicine and boil again for half a day. If further mercury is added and ground to blend, place it back in the crucible and vaporize three to five times. The mercury will ascend, drawing out the haze.\n\nThen, place it in a small crucible, covering with cow dung ash and a touch of salt. Nurture with slow fire. [Unclear text]—whether the juice’s potency is deep or shallow—pound as if already known.\n\nWhen initially pounding, add the mother substance (*mǔ* 母) simultaneously—this is excellent, surpassing adding it in the second round.\n\nSand that has undergone repeated leaching and grinding is light and porous, easily dispersed by wind. Great care must be taken to prevent loss. The method of strong-fire burning in the pan is superior—it ensures the substance is fully refined and retains its medicinal power. Placing it in the crucible also prevents dispersion and avoids fragmentation.\n\nFor the pill balls, some say to use Persian white alum (*bó sī bái fán* 波斯白矾) and *hú tóng lǜ* (胡同律), which is also excellent.\n\nOnce the substance is refined into a liquid and dried, it is better to immerse it in a *huá chí* (华池, \"flower pool\"). The pool method uses water and wine, dissolving *pú xiāo* (朴消) and *bái fán* (白矾), with no grease present.\n\nAnother method: mix salt and water to form a pool, making it slightly concentrated and soft. Alternatively, use *zào jiá* (皂荚) for the pool, which should be thick and potent. The resulting substance will be soft, white, and free of haze.\n\nAnother method...\n\nIf the method is not yet complete, then return it to the crucible for refining.\nFor every *cāng* (斤) of substance, use no more than two *liǎng* (两) of the refined powder, following the *Dān Yáng* method to extract the essence and form *dàn* (砣).\n\nThen wrap the *dàn* in a clay ball for one day, then subject it to thirty *diǎn* (点) treatments, and wrap it again in a clay ball.\nNext, return it to the crucible for refining, adding two *liǎng* of the mother substance for every ten *liǎng* of the refined material. The mother substance must be of the finest quality—preferably from the original mountain or marsh—and must be tested personally, free of any impurities. This is a critical step.\n\nStir thoroughly within the crucible, then pour it into the pool to form a thin *dàn*.\nBefore refining, ensure that *huáng dān* (黄丹) is present in the mixture. When placing it in the crucible, be especially mindful that all lead is fully expelled. If not, this is a flaw.\n\nThen subject it to thirty more *diǎn* treatments, wrap it in a clay ball for another day, and return it to the crucible for refining.\nFor every ten *liǎng* of the substance, add another two *liǎng* of the mother substance, stir thoroughly, and pour it back into the pool to form a *dàn*. The result should be smooth, white, and free of haze.\n\nIf it is still not fully refined, add another six *liǎng* of the mother substance, making a total of twenty *liǎng* (this is the \"paired addition\"). Refine it again in the crucible, stirring well, then add *bìtǔ* (壁土), *bái fán* (白矾), and *kuángshā* (硇砂) to purify the surface, ensuring clarity. Pour it into the pool to form a thin *dàn*.\n\nHeat it in the fire until it glows a deep red, then remove it and let it cool to a bright luster.\nRepeat the heating process three or four times, then wash it thoroughly with a cloth to ensure purity.\nPlace it in a bottle and boil for a full cycle, then remove it. Repeat the heating and boiling process—each cycle of boiling counts as one refining in the crucible.\n\nDo this seven times until no haze remains.\nIf the substance is still not fully refined, proceed to the subsequent methods to achieve the true treasure.\n\n---\n**On the Method of *Hóng Yín* (红银):**\nThe *Jīn Líng Zǐ* (金陵子) says: Upon reading the *Dān Jīng* (丹经), he suddenly understood this principle.\nThe *hóng yín* (red silver) should be refined according to the *Dān Yáng* method until no haze remains.\nIf this is not possible, take the *hóng yín* that has already been refined to a red-silver hue and grind it into a powder, then mix it with *gǒng* (汞). Use a small amount of *gǒng*—too much will cause haze and make it difficult to refine.\n\nAfter thoroughly washing and refining, add more *gǒng* and mix it with lead, stirring well before placing it in the furnace. Secure it with flat cloth and let it sublimate.\nThe furnace should be lined with yellow soil and paper fibers, then covered with dry yellow soil, five *cùn* (寸) thick, with an additional one *cùn* layer on top.\n\nOn the first day, use gentle fire to nurture it without allowing the *gǒng* to rise.\nOn the second day, gradually increase the heat, and on the third day, apply strong fire to drive the *gǒng* upward.\nOpen the furnace when it cools, collect the *gǒng* from the upper vessel, and retrieve the lead from the furnace, then immerse it in the pool to achieve whiteness.\nDo not add any *fán* (矾) or other substances to the furnace, as this may cause the *gǒng* to crystallize into frost and weaken the lead’s potency.\nIf the lead still shows impurities, break it down again—it will eventually succeed.\n\nAnother method states that the amount of *hóng yín* sand is not limited; simply refine it thoroughly and mix it with lead. Even if it is not fully refined, it will still yield results.\nAdd one *liǎng* of [missing term] and grind it together before refining—this will prevent haze.\n\nAnother method involves sifting the refined substance through fine silk and mixing it with water until it forms a moist, granular mass. Place a small amount of *xiǎn* (盥) in the mixture, then refine the lead and other substances using the standard method.\n\n---\n**Method for *Suì Zǐ* (遂子) from *Hóng Yín*:**\nTake one *jīn* (斤) of thoroughly refined *hóng yín* (red silver), mix it with four *liǎng* of the mother substance, making a total of twenty *liǎng*. Form a thin *dàn* in a crucible—if it is too thick, pound it until even.\n\nAfter pounding, heat it until it matches the fire’s hue, then boil and wash it clean. Use three *jīn* of *gǒng* (汞), place the *dàn* flat in the *gāng* (铛), and secure it tightly. Apply gentle fire, like that of a midsummer day, then gradually increase the heat.\n\nOpen the furnace every two days. If *gǒng* rises, slightly reduce the fire—only enough to prevent it from rising further.\nAfter twenty days, recast it into a *dàn*. Repeat this process for another twenty days, then recast again.\nAfter refining and nurturing for six [missing term], all haze will disappear, and it will become the true treasure.\n(Note: One version states \"six *liǎng* folded into two.\")\n\nWhen first refining, add a small amount of *kuángshā* (硇砂) and *dǎnzǐ* (胆子), then boil the *gǒng* for a day. The *dàn* should adhere to the bottom of the *gāng*, fully integrating with the *gǒng*—this is ideal.\n\nAnother method states: Take four *liǎng* of the *dàn*, mix one *liǎng* of *Běi Tíng kuángshā* (北庭硇砂), one *liǎng* of *shí dǎn* (石胆), and one *fēn* (分) of *jié lín yì* (骇鳞蜴). Grind these three substances together, then mix with rice vinegar into a paste and coat the *dàn*. Wrap it in yellow soil, one *cùn* and two *fēn* thick, and bake it in husk-fire for three days. Then burn it with white charcoal for three more days.\nRemove the soil and place it in the original vessel with four *liǎng* of *gǒng*. (From the *Dān Shā Jīng* (丹砂经).)\n\nAnother version says: Before refining, line the vessel with *huáng dān* (黄丹) and *hú fěn* (胡粉) to form a paste. Place the *gǒng* and *dàn* inside, and after one refining cycle of ten days, there will be no haze—whether the quantity is large or small, it is at the user’s discretion, with ten *liǎng* as the standard.\n\nAnother version states: For *suì zǐ*, mix with *xiāoshí* (消石) and refine it for seven days, alternating between upright and inverted positions each day. After seven days, it will turn into black ash. Grind and wash it thoroughly, then refine it until it becomes white and fluffy.\n\n---\n**The Dao of *Suì Zǐ*:**\nThe essence of *suì zǐ* lies in its minimal haze—this makes oral ingestion easier. If the process seems difficult, this is the key insight.\nTake one *jīn* of thoroughly refined *hóng yín* (red silver), mix it with four *liǎng* of the mother substance, making a total of twenty *liǎng*. Form a thin *dàn* in a crucible—if it is too thick, pound it until even.\n\nAfter pounding, heat it until it matches the fire’s hue, then boil and wash it clean. Use three *jīn* of *gǒng* (汞), place the *dàn* in the *gāng* (铛), and add a small amount of *shí dǎn* (石胆) and *kuángshā* (硇砂) water. Boil for a day—the *gǒng* and *dàn* should fully integrate, with the *dàn* adhering to the bottom of the *gāng*. Then seal it tightly and let the *yīn* (阴) energy emerge.\n\nThe *Suì Zǐ* Method Continued:\n\nAt first, use two *liǎng* of *wǔ* (武), then gradually increase to two *liǎng* of *wén* (文). Use only the finest, most volatile *fēi shàng* (flying mercury), slightly refined.\n\nThus, after twenty days, remove the excess *shēng gǒng* (raw mercury), leaving only what fits in the crucible. Again, form a *dàn* as before, placing the mercury inside, and proceed as earlier. After twenty days, repeat this process.\n\nA third time, form the crucible anew, and once more introduce the mercury to produce the *dàn*. In this way, over six cycles, the haze will fully dissipate, surpassing even mountain and river ores.\n\nThe *Jīnlíng Zǐ* says: The mercury used in each boiling and in refining the red silver will become impure. It can be purified by washing with salt, alum, or even rice washing—this is excellent.\n\nOnce the mercury is cleansed, use it again with refined results.\n\nMoreover, I have seen in the *Qī Piān Dānshā Jué* (Seven Chapters on Cinnabar Secrets) that medicinal substances are used to nurture the gold crucible through this very method. Now, red silver should likewise be prepared according to this principle—it is superior.\n\nThe medicinal mixture applied to the crucible before firing consists of:\n- One *liǎng* of northern *kuángshā* (硇砂),\n- One *liǎng* of rock salt (*shí yán*),\n- One *liǎng* of *qílín jié* (麒麟竭).\n\nGrind these three together, mix with a small amount of wine to form a paste, and coat the crucible evenly. Then, wrap it in yellow clay, one *cùn* and two *fēn* thick, and fire it in the furnace for fourteen days. Afterward, burn with white charcoal for three days, following the prescribed method.\n\nWhen firing white substances, the medicinal coating can be added directly, making the *Suì Zǐ* even more potent.\n\nAnother method for firing the silver crucible:\n- One *liǎng* of alum ash (*bái fán huī*),\n- One *liǎng* of *kuángshā*,\n- One *liǎng* of *xiāoshí* (消石, niter),\n- Two *liǎng* of salt, roasted in hidden fire.\n\nApply this mixture, wrap it in clay as before, and fire with husk fuel for seven days, then burn with white charcoal for one hidden period—this is the standard.\n\n*End of the Lower Scroll of the Dragon-Tiger Reunion Elixir Secrets.*",

Two scrolls.\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canonical Daoist Treasury of the Zhengtong Era), *Dongshen* (Cavern Spirit) section, *Zhongshu* (Miscellaneous Arts) category.\n\n**Scroll One: Jinlingzi’s Explanation of the *Zhiyehongying* (Purple Leaf Red Flower) Great Reversion Elixir Formula**\n\nThe Reversion Elixir originates from the quintessence of the Nine Heavens, nurtured by the Twenty-Four Celestial Worthies. True Water, True Fire—encompassing both external and internal—refine the Five Divine Energies and the movements of *qi*, accumulating as *shuishā* (water-sand). When the gathered *qi* reaches its utmost, it becomes the *Zhihuá Hóngyīng* (Purple Bloom Red Flower) Elixir.\n\nAgain, from the *Wù-Jǐ Zhōnggōng* (Mid-Court of the Fifth-Sixth Heavenly Stems) Yellow Gold, the essence is purified through the *Lǐ* (Alchemical Process), and its completion lies in the *Jǐu* (Nine). Thus, the Yang Gold undergoes transformation, its dynamic *qi* and alchemical mechanisms shifting, its essence changing form, and it harmonizes with the Five Directions’ constitution. Only then does it transcend the Three Primordial Elements (*Sānyuán*), shed its material body, and return to its True Nature—hence the name *Reversion Elixir*, a marvelous and refined metamorphosis.\n\nThe Reversion Elixir has no fixed method; the *Jīnbì Jīng* (Golden Splendor Scripture) and the *Cāntóng Qì* (Grand Concordance of the Mysterious) are its methods. Since antiquity, true immortals have all concealed their secrets. Sacred texts are hidden in celestial caverns, golden tablets sealed within the Daoist sanctuaries. Even if the oral formulas are inscribed on paper, they must still be transmitted by a master and cannot be recklessly applied. Their principles are profound and unfathomable; their meanings hidden and difficult to discern.\n\nNow, for those who love the Dao and aspire to longevity, they must first distinguish the quality of their medicinal ingredients—high or low—and recognize *True Mercury* and *True Lead*. They must understand the temperaments and nature of metals and minerals before refining Lead and Mercury with Fire, for these are the foundations of the elixir.\n\n**Discerning Mercury**\nAccording to the hidden names in Daoist scriptures, Mercury is called:\n- *Héshàng Lǎonǚ* (Old Woman of the Riverbank),\n- *Chángshēngzǐ* (Child of Longevity),\n- *Gōng* (Mercury),\n- *Tàiyáng Liúzhū* (Luminous Pearl of the Great Sun),\n- *Shénjiāo* (Divine Glue),\n- *Língyángzǐ* (Child of the Ling Mountain),\n- *Xuánmíng Lóng* (Mysterious Brightness Dragon),\n- *Xuánshuǐ* (Mysterious Water),\n- *Báihǔ Nǎo* (Brain of the White Tiger),\n- *Jīnyín Xí* (Mercury-Lead Mat).\n\nJinlingzi says: Mercury is the divine essence of the Five Yang Energies, where the Five Divine Energies converge into one. It takes form in *dānshā* (cinnabar), residing in the South. When it is extracted from minerals, the Five Metals and seventy-two stones—most of which absorb excess *Yīn qi*—become coarse and rigid, their nature sluggish and their potency far inferior. Thus, Mercury is called *Rénshuǐ* (Ninth Water), for it is water in essence. It can ascend lightly, transform subtly, and command the obedience of all spirits.\n\nIn totality, it is called *Dānyáng* (Elixir-Sun), as water encompasses the Eight Stones, containing within itself the essence of gold. Its cinnabar holds the most refined and divine, the most sacred and luminous. Even a mere two *liǎng* (ounces) held in one’s sleeve can repel malevolent spirits; how much more so when it is ingested and harmonized within the Five Viscera?\n\nThe Five Divine Energies converge, the *qi* coalesces, and the form is born as cinnabar—this is the purest essence of the Great Sun, the sovereign of the Red Emperor, the true body of the Gold-Fire, in communion with the Eight Stones, responsive to the Twenty-Four *qi* Movements. It is the master of all spirits, the root of transformation, the foundation of the Luminous God, capable of change and metamorphosis—thus it is called the *Chìlóng* (Vermilion Dragon). If it soars aloft, it is named *Zhūwū* (Crimson Crow).\n\nThe elixir is formed when gold is affected by fire, hence its name *dān*. Mercury is when fire departs from gold, hence its name *gōng*. When the essence of gold and fire conjoin, they contain the pure and settled *qi* of the Mysterious Primordial, the fundamental essence of the Reversion Elixir, and the source of the Great Medicine. When their *virtue/power* (*dé*) is harmonized, all phenomena arise; when their substance is separated, they vanish into the unfathomable.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"The Yang Essence blazes resplendent; obtaining it allows one to return the soul and restore the spirit.\"*\n\nAccording to the *Shòushòu Jì* (Record of Receiving Longevity), it is also said: *\"The Yang Essence blazes resplendent; it solidifies the soul and steadies the spirit, being the supreme grade of the immortals.\"*\n\nIf one attains the highest-grade cinnabar, it requires no further refining or fusion—it is already fit for ingestion. This is the natural Reversion Elixir.\n\nThough cinnabar is the essence of the True Yang, surpassing all things in its luminosity, its origin varies by region—mountains, valleys, and lands—each absorbing different *qi*, resulting in tens of varieties. One must carefully discern them.\n\nEven among ordinary people, their spiritual nature is unequal; the flesh and blood of birds and beasts also differ, and must be clearly distinguished.\n\nThe highest-grade cinnabar grows in the stone cavities of the *Chénjǐn* (Zhenjin) Prefecture, manifesting in multiple hues.\n\nThe middle-grade cinnabar is found in *Jiāoguì* (Guangxi-Jiangxi), also with several forms.\n\nThe lowest-grade cinnabar is from *Héngshào* (Hengyang-Shaoyang), with various qualities and grades.\n\nAll are shaped by the purity or turbidity of their constitution, the true or false nature of their *qi*, and the division of their essence as they resonate with metals and minerals. Those that absorb the True *qi* can be ingested to attain communion with the Mysterious Dao, making one a High Immortal. Those that absorb partial *qi* grant longevity and worldly survival.\n\nFor instance, the *Guāngmíngshā* (Luminous Cinnabar) of the highest grade emerges from the stone cavities of *Chénjǐn* Mountain, atop a white bed and white stratum, in clusters of twelve or nine pieces—these being the most potent. Those of seven or five pieces are of secondary efficacy.\n\nWithin each cluster, there is a large pearl weighing over ten *liǎng*, called the *Zhǔjūn* (Master Sovereign). Surrounding it are smaller pieces, also weighing eight or nine *liǎng*, or even six or seven, called the *Chén* (Subordinates), which encircle and defer to the central pearl.\n\nOn the four sides of the cluster, there is also a mixed cinnabar of one or two *dǒu* (bushels), embracing the jade-like cluster and its crimson bed.\n\nFrom the mixed cinnabar outside the cluster, if one selects the *Fúróngtóu* (Peony-Head) variety, places it upon red silk, and it remains luminously transparent, it is also counted among the highest grade.\n\nAnother variety resembles *Mǎyáchéng* (Horse-Tooth Form), with a white exterior and floating brilliance—this is the highest grade.\n\nThe *Báimǎyáshā* (White Horse-Tooth Cinnabar), if elongated like a *xiàoshēng* (smiling figure) and colored red-purple, is also the highest grade.\n\nThe *Zǐlíngshā* (Purple Luminous Cinnabar), if it appears as stone fragments with sharp edges and emits a greenish glow, is of the lowest grade.\n\nThe cinnabar from *Jiāoguì* (Guangxi-Jiangxi), if it grows in clusters or is obtained by striking stones and forms like *Fúróngtóu* (Peony-Head) while remaining luminous, is also of the highest grade.\n\nIf it appears as coarse grains, with three or four pieces weighing a *jīn* (pound), and is translucent, it is of the middle grade.\n\nIf it appears as flakes or fragments and is clear, it is of the lowest grade, such as that from *Héngshào* (Hengyang-Shaoyang).\n\nIn summary, cinnabar obtained from clusters or by striking stones, if it emits a red glow, is also of the lowest grade—such as *Xīshā* (Stream Cinnabar).",

      "translated_text": "There are grains that form and are translucent—if one refines and ingests them, one may achieve longevity and remain in the world, though not yet ascend to the rank of an *upper immortal* (上仙).\n\nCinnabar from the earth, born within earthly cavities, and stream cinnabar nurtured in the sandy soil of streams, when they emerge, are mixed—thus they do not qualify as *upper-grade elixir* (上药) for consumption.\n\nThe *seat-grown* cinnabar is the supreme grade of the elixir. Obtaining the central *master cinnabar* (主君砂) from its seat—one grain—when refined and ingested into the five *zàng* (viscera), its efficacy becomes manifest, and it is called the *upper-grade cinnabar elixir* (上丹台). The vital *zhèngqì* (正气) endures, and one transcends all worldly burdens.\n\nFurther, after refining it through seven *fǎn* (returns) and nine *huán* (retreats), one attains effortless ascension. Hence, the true essence of *yang* (male, luminous) *qi* descends and coalesces into a radiant, full orb—untainted by any *piānxié* (perverse, pathogenic) influence.\n\nBut the refined cinnabar of the *Peony-Head* (芙蓉头) form, which is luminous and round, is indeed the supreme elixir for *immortals* (神仙) to consume.\n\nThe *scriptures* (经) state that cinnabar is the *natural elixir* (自然还丹).\n\nMoreover, as with the *jade-seat cinnabar* (玉座之砂) commonly known by the world—such as the *gold-seat cinnabar* (金座) or *heaven-seat cinnabar* (天座)—\n\nThe *Supreme Purple Dragon’s Mysterious Elixir* (太上紫龙玄华之丹) is beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.\n\nThe *jade-seat cinnabar* is refined by those of *common aspiration* (俗流志士) who accumulate merit and cultivate its essence to attain immortality.\n\nThe *gold-seat cinnabar* is obtained by those with *immortal predisposition* (仙骨), who purify their spirits and refine their essence in seclusion within mountain caves. When they gather and consume its cinnabar, they ascend instantly, their bodies *avianizing* (羽化). Ascending to the *heaven-seat cinnabar* (天座), they then partake of the elixir of the *Supreme Celestial Immortals* (太上天仙真官), not the medicine of lesser immortals.\n\nThe *jade-seat cinnabar*, having absorbed the *pure, luminous, and refined essence* (阳虚之清精) of sixty thousand years, transforms into *gold-seat cinnabar*. The *gold-seat cinnabar* is yellow within its seat, bearing five grains layered in growth, surrounded on all sides by forty-five small pearls.\n\nThe *gold-seat cinnabar*, having absorbed the *pure, luminous, and refined essence* of sixty thousand years further, transforms into *heaven-seat cinnabar*. The *heaven-seat cinnabar* is verdant in color, bearing nine grains within its seat, layered in growth, and encircled on all sides by seventy-two grains.\n\nIt dwells in the *floating void* (飘飘太虚), perpetually guarded by the *Supreme Unity Spirit* (太一之神). On the *Upper Primordial Day* (上元之日), the *true officials* (真官) descend to harvest it, and the mountain suddenly blazes, its light radiant as fire.\n\nThe *heaven-seat cinnabar* is gathered by the *true officials*—common mortals cannot obtain it.\n\nThe *luminous cinnabar* (光明砂), for every *jīn* (pound), contains only two *liǎng* (ounces) of *stone qi* (石气) and yields fourteen *liǎng* of *mercury* (水银).\n\nThe *White Horse Tooth Cinnabar* (白马牙砂), for every *jīn*, contains four *liǎng* of *stone qi* and yields twelve *liǎng* of *mercury*.\n\nThe *Purple Luminous Cinnabar* (紫灵砂), for every *jīn*, contains six *liǎng* of *stone qi* and yields ten *liǎng* of *mercury*.\n\nThe *upper-grade, luminous stream cinnabar* (上色通明溪砂), for every *jīn*, yields eight *liǎng* and a half of *mercury*, with seven *liǎng* and a half of *stone qi*.\n\nThe *mixed-color earth cinnabar* (杂色土砂), for every *jīn*, yields seven *liǎng* and a half of *mercury*, with eight *liǎng* and a half of *stone qi*.\n\n*Stone qi* (石气) is the *void essence* of *fire stone* (火石).\n\nAfter the *mercury* is extracted, a *stone residue* (石胎) of one *liǎng*—greenish-white and gray—remains.\n\nThe *luminous cinnabar*, having absorbed the *clear, refined, and true essence* (清通澄朗正真之精气) of the *Supreme Sun* (太阳), forms into cinnabar. Consuming one *liǎng* is equivalent in power to four *liǎng* of *White Horse Tooth Cinnabar*.\n\nThe *White Horse Tooth Cinnabar* absorbs the *balanced, gentle, and compliant essence* (平和柔顺之精气) of the *Supreme Sun*. Consuming one *liǎng* is equivalent in power to eight *liǎng* of *Purple Luminous Cinnabar*.\n\nThe *Purple Luminous Cinnabar* absorbs the *void qi* of mountains and marshes, while the *stream cinnabar* and *earth cinnabar* of mixed grades all absorb *turbulent, stagnant, and untrue qi* (浊滞不真之气), forming into cinnabar—none can compare in potency.\n\nHaving thus distinguished the grades of cinnabar elixir, one knows the hierarchy of *mercury*.\n\nFor the cultivation of *elixir medicine* (至药), one must absolutely avoid *mercury* of mixed grades. This is the *true secret* (真诀).\n\nThe *Great Cavern True Scripture* (大洞真经) conceals its *true mercury* (真汞), taking only *upper-grade cinnabar* (上品丹砂) that is of a single hue, extracting its *mercury*, and then infusing it with *internal water and internal fire qi* (内水内火气) to make it *true mercury*.\n\nThus the *scripture* says: *\"Mixed grades of different kinds—how could they unite in form and reside?\"* (杂类不同种，焉能合体居). Only those of the same kind are *true mercury*—also called *mother-child mercury* (子母).\n\nThe *Immortal Scriptures* keep this secret and do not reveal it.\n\nThe *Child of Jinling* (金陵子) says: *\"When mercury is cast upon cinnabar, it produces cinnabar grains—this is also the gold-seat cinnabar.\"*\n\n*True mercury* (真汞) is obtained by extracting mercury from the *upper-grade cinnabar*, then infusing it with *internal water and internal fire qi* before it can be so named.\n\n**Method for Extracting Mercury from Cinnabar:**\n\nTake *jīnzhú* (筋竹) as a tube, storing it fully in three *joints* (节). Pierce a hole in the upper joint, large enough for a *bullet* (弹丸). Use a small hole in the middle joint, like the size of a *tendon* (筋头), for the mercury to drip through. First, lay two layers of thick wax paper beneath the middle joint.\n\nThen take finely ground cinnabar and place it within the tube. Secure the tube tightly with hemp rope, and steam it for one day.\n\nNext, wrap it in yellow clay, making the layer three *fēn* (fingers-width) thick, and bury it in the earth. Level the tube with the ground, and firmly pack the surrounding soil so that no *qi* escapes.\n\nPile wood atop and ignite it. After one *cycle of fire* (复时), let the flames penetrate the upper joint of the tube. The mercury will then flow downward into the middle joint, undivided by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nWhen the fire is small and the mercury begins to emerge, the remaining ash is still black and purple. Repeat the process until the mercury is fully gathered, ensuring the fire is sufficient.\n\nAmong all methods, this is the most essential and wondrous.\n\nEven if cinnabar is of the same kind, once its mercury is extracted and mixed with other cinnabar, it must again absorb *internal water and internal fire qi* before it can be used.\n\n**Method for Refining Mercury:**\n\nMercury: one *jīn* (pound)\n*Shíliúhuáng* (石硫黄, sulfur): three *liǎng* (ounces)\n\nGrind the *shíliúhuáng* into powder and place it in a porcelain basin. Apply gentle heat, and drip the mercury in slowly, stirring vigorously with the hand until it becomes *green sand* (青砂).\n\nThen transfer it into a porcelain *retreating vessel* (鉼, *huánluán* vessel), which can hold one *shēng* (pint). Seal it with clay, making the layer two *fēn* thick, and cover it tightly. Secure it completely.\n\nPlace it in a furnace, using one *jīn* of charcoal. Around the vessel on all sides, arrange the charcoal in long strands, totaling one *jīn*.",

      "translated_text": "Three days later, apply *wu* fire (violent fire) to burn it, using ten *jīn* of charcoal, divided into two portions—five *jīn* above, five *jīn* below—the vessel. When green vapor suddenly emerges, immediately coat it with thin, diluted clay, lest flames escape, until the charcoal is exhausted.\n\nWait for it to cool, then open it. The mercury will have transformed into *zǐshā* (紫砂, cinnabar sand), without loss of a single grain.\n\nAgain, take the previous *zǐshā* and mix it with one *jīn* of black lead. First, melt the black lead within the cauldron to form a liquid. Then, finely grind the *zǐshā* and toss it into the lead liquid. Remove the fire and quickly stir-fry it by hand until the mixture congeals into sand. Return it to the cauldron, grind it finely, cover it with salt to a thickness of two *fēn*, and press it firmly to ensure contact. Apply *wu* fire (violent fire) to it for half a day, and the refined mercury (*línggǒng*, 灵汞) will emerge, without loss of a single grain. This is called *internal water and fire qi* (内水火).\n\nThe *Jīnlíng* adept said: The essence of *yang* is fire, the essence of *yin* is water. When *yin* and *yang* are subdued and balanced, water and fire hold each other in check; hence, the *yang* and *yin* are governed by this principle.\n\nAgain, regarding cinnabar and mercury: Though one may distinguish their quality as high or low, there are instances where they have been tainted. Mercury, regardless of impurity, if it has come near the dead, is exceedingly difficult to discern. If cinnabar has been exposed to the *shēngsǐ* (生死, life-and-death) defilements, its outermost layer of vermilion will fall away, leaving the grains bright and clean, stripped of their coating. This indicates it has been tainted. Now, only select the cinnabar of the finest hue, for it alone, through sublimation and refinement, yields the purest mercury.\n\n**Discerning True Lead:**\n\nAccording to the *hidden names* in the Daoist scriptures, true lead is called by many names: *lìzhìshí* (立制石, stabilizing stone), *huángjīng* (黄精, yellow essence), *xuánhuá* (玄华, dark splendor), *báihǔ* (白虎, white tiger), *huángyá* (黄芽, yellow sprout), *héchē* (河车, celestial chariot), *huángchí* (黄池, yellow pool), *huánglóng* (黄龙, yellow dragon), and *mùxī* (木锡, wooden tin).\n\nThe *Lónghǔ Jīng* (龙虎经, *Dragon-Tiger Classic*) states: \"Lead is black externally, dark and splendid internally, with a golden body.\"\n\nThe *Qiántōng Jué* (潜通诀, *Subtle Penetration Canon*) says: \"The dark and white produce the golden *gōng* (公, sovereign). Majestic and towering, the beginning is established.\"\n\nThe *Jīnlíng* adept said: True lead is obtained by extracting it from *lìshí* (铆石, lead ore) through sublimation, without prior smelting or refining. It retains its primordial *yuángǔ* (元气, original qi), making it the true lead. The *Dà Dòng Zhēn Jīng* (大洞真经, *True Classic of the Great Cavern*) conceals its true lead, and it must not be divulged lightly.\n\nThe true *water and internal fire qi* (真水内火) are black lead and sulfur. Lead and tin both draw upon the *qi* of the northern *bīng* (壬) and *guǐ* (癸) stems. Tin absorbs the *bīng* essence, while lead imbibes the *guǐ* qi. Gold ultimately depends upon *guǐ*, so lead is the refined essence of the utmost *yin*. As the Daoist scriptures say: \"If lead is not true, the mercury will not bond with it.\" Therefore, lead must be true.\n\n**Further Canon:**\n\nThe *Great Return* (大还) and *Nine Returns* (九还) are different names for the same process. *Return* (返) refers to sand transforming into gold, while *Return* (还) refers to gold reverting back to cinnabar. The scriptures say: \"Return to my native place, revert to my eternal form. When taken, I will ascend in broad daylight to the Celestial Sovereign.\"\n\nThe cinnabar furnace and cauldron must also harmonize the *Three Realms* (天地人, *Tiāndìrén*) of Heaven, Earth, and Man.\n\nThe cauldron should be made of *yàojīn* (药金, medicinal gold) weighing twenty-four *liǎng*, corresponding to the twenty-four *qi* (气, seasonal breaths). Eight *liǎng* are used for the lid, which should hold nine *héng* (合, cups). Take it during the *jiǎchén* (甲辰, *Jiachen*) decan, specifically on the *wǔshēn* (戊申, *Wushen*) day, from the southwest *shēn* (申, *Shen*) direction. Use pure soil to construct the furnace, with an internal diameter of one *chǐ* (尺, foot) and two *cùn* (寸, inches). It must have three tiers and twelve gates, each gate equipped with a shutter.\n\nWith the finest *guāngmíngshā* (光明砂, luminous cinnabar) as the primary ingredient, assisted by black lead, sulfur, *chìshèng* (赤盛, red abundance), and *mǎyǎxiāo* (马牙消, horse-tooth borax), the *Seven Returns* and *Nine Returns* are the elixirs for longevity and ascension in this world.\n\nTake one *jīn* of cinnabar, crush it into pieces as fine as hemp seeds, and mix it with *shílíng* (石灵, stone spirit) and *mǎyǎxiāo*. Boil it in water for forty days, as *yang* (阳) medicine is refined by *yin* (阴) means.\n\nThen place it in the cauldron and refine it with *yin-yang* fire methods for five days. Four days are spent in the *kǎn* (坎, *Kan*) hexagram method—boiling. One day is spent in the *lí* (离, *Li*) hexagram method—flying with fire. Thus, five days constitute one *hòu* (候, period), and three periods make one *qì* (气, breath). Using eight breaths and twenty-four periods, a total of one hundred and twenty days, the cinnabar will have undergone sublimation.\n\nWrap it with *yánghuā* (盐花, salt flowers), then seal it with yellow soil as clay, pressing it tightly to secure the golden cauldron. Place it in the furnace and burn it with violent fire for thirty days.\n\nThen extract the sublimated silver, also called *huánghuǒyín* (黄火银, yellow-fire silver), adding one *liǎng* at a time, until it gradually becomes golden. After seven such returns, the cinnabar will be complete, known as *Xuánzhēn Jiàngxiā Shā* (玄真绛霞砂, *Mysterious True Vermilion-Crimson Sand*), which, when taken, grants longevity and worldly immortality. It can also transmute mercury and the five metals into treasures.\n\nAgain, take this *Jiàngxiā Shā* (绛霞砂, vermilion-crimson sand) and extract fifteen *liǎng* of *zǐjīn* (紫金, purple gold). Mix it with one *jīn* of true lead and five *liǎng* of sulfur. Combine these three substances, place them in the cauldron, and refine them for six cycles. In each cycle, add *yang* sulfur, using a golden cauldron and erecting a furnace platform. Begin the fire at the *Zǐ* (子) hour on *Jiǎ* (甲) days, and each cycle spans two months, sixty days.\n\nWhen the cinnabar is near completion, a purple vapor will rise continuously, obscuring the light of the sun and moon, causing the mountains and rivers to tremble. Upon its completion, it will ascend with a radiant glow, detaching from its gross form, resembling a nine-layered lotus, clinging to the cauldron lid—fifteen *liǎng* without loss of a single grain.\n\nWithin the cauldron, there will be twenty-four *liǎng* of lingering ash, colored like *zǐjīn*. A single pellet of this purple ash, the size of a hemp seed, can transmute one *jīn* of mercury and the five metals into supreme treasures.\n\nAncient immortals who mastered its true essence could, with a single dose of the *Seven Returns* sand, achieve extraordinary potency. Why has its truth not yet been verified? Because the *lǜyào* (绿药, green medicine) still retains its obstructive form and cannot yet ascend freely, remaining bound to the five elements as mere *shìhuǒ* (世火, mundane fire) and being consumed by it. Yet, with each of the nine transformations, the elixir becomes lighter and more refined, transcending ordinary matter, radiating a round and brilliant light, and its purple vapor ascends to the heavens. It encounters substances and transforms without obstruction, enduring countless refining cycles, never being consumed, and its essence grows ever more potent.",

Apply gentle heat, and drip the mercury in slowly, stirring vigorously with the hand until it becomes *green sand* (青砂).\n\nThen transfer it into a porcelain *retreating vessel* (鉼, *huánluán* vessel), which can hold one *shēng* (pint). Seal it with clay, making the layer two *fēn* thick, and cover it tightly. Secure it completely.\n\nPlace it in a furnace, using one *jīn* of charcoal. Around the vessel on all sides, arrange the charcoal in long strands, totaling one *jīn*.",

(子母) alchemy unites their natures,\ndistinguishing between firm and yielding.\nThen one must use *hidden-fire lead* (伏火铅) and *mercury* (汞),\nupper *Dānyáng* elixir and upper *Yào* (药),\nto transmute their essence.\n\nAgain, the five metals buried underground for a thousand years,\nonly gold and silver retain their original essence—\nthe rest all turn to ash.\n\nThis method of mine has extracted and refined their essence,\nunaltered by fire or decayed by earth,\nmaking them capable of transformation—\ncrafting *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳), how could this be easy?\n\nIf one’s bones are the *immortal

treasure.\n\nThis is the supreme alchemy of the *Immortal Dao* (神仙),\nnot easily known by those who act hastily.\n\nIf one is not of this tradition,\none must meticulously study the principles of substances,\nconsult widely among alchemical texts,\ndiscern the hierarchy of *master-servant* (君臣),\nand know their prohibitions.\n\nIts *Yào* (药) has firm and yielding qualities,\nmethods of suppression and concealment,\nrepelling fire and hidden fire,\ndistinct uses when raw and when refined—\nsometimes employing lead and mercury together,\nsometimes using only the four *huáng* (黄).\n\nThe teachings of the *Immortal Dao* (神仙流) encompass myriad methods and countless formulas,\nall concealed and never fully revealed.\nEven if alchemical texts are passed down,\nthey are transmitted in confusion,\nand most later scholars achieve nothing.\n\nThis is because the wise do not diligently refine their understanding,\nnor grasp the *saintly intent* (圣意).\nTheir applications are shallow and ineffective.\n\nThey also lack full mastery of crucibles, furnaces, tongs, and sheaths,\nand do not probe the subtleties of burning, casting, and refining.\nIn the furnace’s flames, they rush past the critical moment—\nhow could they witness success?\n\nUsing refined *Yào* (药) is somewhat easier,\nbut raw *Yào* is far more difficult.\nThis method employs only raw *Yào*,\ntransmuting their essence into truth,\ndepending on precise timing—\nstopping and starting, extracting and inserting—\nthe seasons are key,\nand it also resolves the auxiliary lead and mercury.\n\nThe *Classics* state:\n*A vessel with an internal diameter of one inch*\ncan hold *mercury* of one *jīn* (斤).\nAgain, by measure:\n*A gold cube of one inch*\nweighs one *jīn*,\n*a silver

*five heavenly spirits* (五阳神) of the most refined essence,\nunmatched in comparison.\nThe rest vary greatly—\nonly refined copper and silver are somewhat similar in weight,\ntheir forms soft and yielding, nearly equal in flexibility.\n\n*Xu* (徐) has a single *radiance* (晕) hue,\nwhile the others resemble one another—\nindeed, they can all be transmuted.\n\nMoreover, the *Five Metals Secret* (《五金诀》) states:\n*The power of realgar* can transmute iron,\n*the power of orpiment* (雌黄) can transmute tin,\n*the power of orpiment* (砒黄) can transmute copper,\n*sulfur* (硫黄) can transmute silver into mercury.\nThe four *huáng* (黄) can also reverse iron into copper,\nreverse copper into silver,\nreverse silver into gold—\nlike grain turning into rice,\nthis is the natural Dao/Way of heaven and earth.\n\nMagnetite attracts needles,\namber picks up dust—\nhow could these be other spirits?\n\nAgain, the *Classics* say:\n*Only those who master the Dao/Way and its techniques*\ncan refine and govern with ease,\nskillfully combining them,\nand thus create true treasure.\n\nThis method of mine transmutes iron into copper,\nand orpiment into silver—\nthe principle is identical.\n\nThe formula is as follows:\n\n**Refining *Dānyáng* (丹阳) Method**\nThirty *liǎng* (两) of *orpiment* (砒黄) from *Lìzhōu*,\nfree of mixed stones,\nas red as a *parrot’s crest* (鹦冠),\nand glowing brightest in

unfit.\nIf it contains mixed *realgar*, even if similar,\nthis method does not use it.\n\nTwo *liǎng* of *Hútóng* (胡同) *lǜ* (律), using stone *lǜ* resembling ginger root in form,\nsteeped in strong vinegar until it boils without settling.\n\nTwo *liǎng* of salt, roasted with *huā* (花) until its color changes.\n\nThese four ingredients total forty-two *liǎng*.\n\nFirst, take *orpiment* the size of small dates,\ngrind it finely,\nand weigh precisely thirty *liǎng*.\nPlace it in an iron pan (铁铛).\nFor every *jīn* of *Yào* (药),\nuse five *shāng* (升) of raw sesame oil,\nand simmer it gently over low fire,\nallowing it to bubble softly—\ndo not let the flames rage fiercely.\n\nDo this for nine days and nine nights.\nIf the oil becomes too thick,\ndraw it off and replace it with fresh oil,\nuntil the nine days are complete.\nThen transfer it into a silk pouch,\nand place it within a meal,\nensuring the pouch is fully buried in the grain.\nSteam it in the center of the rice for seven days—\nthe oil’s grease will seep into the sand,\nand the *orpiment* will become fresh and crimson.\n\nThe *Classics* state:\n*Imperial Male* (帝男) and *Imperial Female* (帝女),\n*Imperial Female* (雌黄) *orpiment* must be refined thus—\nfirst, to remove its toxicity.\nWhen the toxicity is gone, it can be combined with the five metals.\nSecond, it yields *frost* (霜) in abundance.\n\nIf the *orpiment* is of the highest quality,\nuse the inferior—\nworried that it may contain stubborn stones—\nsimply draw off the oil once,\nand use the purified residue—\nthis is also excellent.\n\n*Orpiment* from *Lìzhōu* is the most potent,\nwhile that from other regions is lesser.\n*Orpiment* (雌黄) should be refined like *Dānyáng*,\nbut during cooking, it must not share the same

Add strong vinegar gradually while simmering over boiling water until the vinegar is exhausted, then replenish it. Repeat this process during the three *dog days* (三伏) until dry.\n\nRemove it and place in an oil wok, cooking over slow fire until the oil bubbles like fish eyes (鱼眼沸). After two *dog days*, extract the flying essence—this is excellent.\n\nIf it does not fly, mix with egg white and clay in a sealed earthenware vessel, place in a sand-rice bag, and steam for one *watch* (周时). This is also excellent.\n\nIf not, mix with red salt and apply to copper to produce gold. The rest follows the original text.\n\n*Hu Tóng Lǜ*’s true method is difficult to obtain.\n\nOne method says: Use it raw alone, applying to copper to produce white gold.\n\nBut if boiled in a porcelain vessel with water, continuously adding until five *sheng* (升) are used, it can remove black stains.\n\nOne version says: Do not boil—use it raw, and it will still work.\n\nSalt should be stir-fried until yellow. If used urgently, without boiling or steaming, it will still suffice.\n\nPowdered salt is inferior to grain salt, grain salt to well-washed salt, and well-washed salt to pond salt.\n\nHowever, take the three substances first, sift them through *yánshā* (岩砂), and mix evenly. Add them to vinegar to dissolve, then stir into the previous medicine until moist. Dry in the sun, then knead thoroughly until well-amalgamated.\n\nRepeat the mixing once more, dry in the sun until slightly damp, then place in the crucible.\n\nOne method says to mix with mulberry ash juice instead. If using vinegar, fear is that it may damage the copper. The method is unclear.\n\nDivide the medicine into two crucibles. Each crucible should hold no more than about twenty *liang* (两)—this is the proper measure.\n\nTake two spoonfuls of lime, mix with the previous medicine, and blend evenly. Spread lime thickly at the bottom of the crucible—at least one *fen* (分) deep—then press the mixture in firmly.\n\nPlace the previous powdered medicine inside, shaping it like the back of a hoe, without pressing hard against the furnace walls. Use a spoon to gently press, then cover lightly with two spoonfuls. Break the surface with the palm to let it merge with the lime, pressing lightly with the spoon until it resembles a hoe shape again.\n\nCover with an additional two *fen* of lime. Press gently to settle, then sprinkle a little water on top until it is just damp. Cover with a basin—slightly taller than the usual one and fifteen *cun* (寸) high.\n\nBurn with alternating gentle and strong fires for two *dog days*. Compared to the usual flying frost method, the fire should be slightly gentler.\n\nWhen cool, open it—the frost should have settled entirely on the furnace surface, with none remaining at the bottom. It will be white, soft, fine, and smooth, like powder when rubbed on the arm.\n\nThe frost that congeals inside the furnace forms a single mass, about one *cun* thick, with striations like bundled silk. It does not fly up into the basin. This is called *external furnace frost* (外炉霜).\n\nSeparately, there will be about half a *liang* that has flown onto the basin, differing in color—collect this separately for other uses.\n\nIf the fire is misjudged and the frost does not fully fly, repeat the process as before.\n\nThis *external furnace frost* is exceptionally effective at softening substances, unlike the brittle hardness of ordinary frost.\n\nOther methods mention flying white frost once, which loses efficacy if used sparingly and causes hardness if overused—this is a major flaw. This frost, however, can be used in any quantity without causing hardness, differing fundamentally from others.\n\nAs for *orpiment*, only the best should be used after reverse extraction. If boiled in oil or steamed, the flying frost can also be applied.\n\nFurthermore, *Kǒng Shì*’s calculations also state: Using white frost once is ideal. These two methods are highly consistent.\n\nAfter producing the *coiled furnace frost* (卧炉霜), take the previous frost, applying two *liang* per *jin* (斤).\n\nAll measurements should use large *jin* and *liang*.\n\nAfter refining *Dānyáng* (丹阳) as per the text, divide it into two crucibles, each holding only eight *liang*—neither too much nor too little, for excess or deficiency will cause drying.\n\nFor every *liang* of medicine, form six pills. For each application, insert three pills, waiting until the gold liquid flows like water. Pierce the crucible to the bottom with an object, then let it drain completely. Stir with charcoal twenty to thirty times, then add more medicine.\n\nRepeat this process similarly, pouring the mixture into a *Huá Píng* (华池) to disperse as pearls. If used urgently, break them with willow branches—even if they do not form pearls, it is acceptable.\n\nAgain, insert three pills as before, adding them to the *Huá Píng* until the color turns white.\n\nUnlike the applied medicine, this does not require heating—simply apply it to the substance, and it will whiten. A second application is needed to ensure full whitening.\n\nApplying raw medicine to a crucible is difficult; the dosage must be precise, ensuring the heat and medicine interact properly, with the gold liquid entering and exiting the crucible smoothly.\n\nRepeat this process carefully, as losses will be significant. The crucible should be slightly deeper.\n\nIf the gold liquid can be made to flow like water upon application, this is the superior method.\n\n*End of Volume One of the Dragon-Tiger Elixir Secrets*\n*Volume Two of the Dragon-Tiger Elixir Secrets*\n*Narrated by Jīnlíngzi*",

One is called *hóng jīn* (red gold), another *hóng xiān jīn* (red fresh gold). There is also *lí jǐ jīn* (separated self-gold), *qīng jīn* (blue gold), and *bǎo jīn* (treasure gold), as well as *dān shā sì huáng* (cinnabar’s four yellows) staining mercury-silver, and *huáng huā yín* (yellow-flowered silver).\n\nMoreover, mercury-silver undergoes myriad transformations, inherently containing these stains. If further dyed, it may turn yellow, red, purple, or crimson—its hue shifts with the alchemical agent.\n\nSome appear as blood-wrapped, resembling *dì huáng* (rehmannia) roots. Others shine like the sun—neither truly yellow, red, nor purple, yet bearing traces of each. These are the refined elixirs of the immortals; mortal perception cannot fully discern them. Their methods and secrets are now recorded here.\n\nTo forge *hóng yín* (red silver), cinnabar is refined into powder, then mixed with mercury, *qīng lǜ* (green vitriol), *shí dǎn* (stone gall), and other alchemical sulfates. The mixture is sealed in an iron vessel and boiled until solidified, yielding a substance resembling *dān yáng* (cinnabar’s lustrous form), with a faint iridescent sheen. Yet even this can be refined to eliminate the iridescence.\n\nThis art holds profound mysteries beyond mere observation. Some masters achieve equal weight of product to input—one *jīn* (catty) yields one *jīn*, one *liǎng* (ounce) yields one *liǎng*. Some require no prolonged boiling, forming silver-like bodies instantly. Others employ cyclical refining, or produce structures without iridescence upon solidification. Some even craft silver vessels from the refined silver itself, using unadulterated elixirs and forgoing iron tools.\n\nAnother method begins with one *liǎng* of mercury, solidified into grains. A porcelain bowl is placed on the ground, and the grains are pressed together—within moments, they harden. An iron pestle is then used to crush them, and another *liǎng* of mercury is added.

      "translated_text": "The refined silver of the **Liǎng** of **Jìnxīn** and **Shìnxīn** states also has a mine, whose nature resembles **Guāngmíng Shā** (光明砂). Its hue is red-purple, vivid and pleasing, fit for furnace use. When smelted and cast, it becomes pure white silver, yielding fourteen or fifteen **liǎng** per **jīn**, a rarity indeed.\n\nIn modern times, such methods are scarcely found in ancient Daoist alchemical texts, and their details remain unclear.\n\nSome suspect it is the red ore of silver, where red silver—when refined with **qīnglǜ** (青绿, *orpiment*), **dǎnzǐ** (胆子, *verdigris*), and other **fán** (矾, *alum*)—yields four or five **liǎng**, or even six or seven, with a color like **Dānyáng** (丹阳, *cinnabar*). Yet when mercury and these minerals are boiled together in iron vessels, they solidify into red silver. For every **jīn** of mercury and ore cast, only four **liǎng** of red silver emerge—this is merely iron, not mercury itself.\n\nOthers claim **dǎnzǐ** and **qīnglǜ** are merely **tóngmiáo** (铜苗, *copper essence*), containing iron rather than copper, which is why mercury can extract it. Yet this is not related to alchemical processes. The four **liǎng** obtained are iron extracted by mercury, not a product of the elixir.\n\nI have weighed these minerals carefully and recorded their true nature. When boiling and refining in a single crucible, lacking five **liǎng** of red silver, only four and a half emerge—proving they are all iron, without deception.\n\nMoreover, when refining **shāzǐ** (砂子, *mercury ore*), if the vessel is completely filled and the fire too fierce, the mercury will flee in fine, needle-like threads, imperceptible to the eye. Those who fail to notice this will lose everything without knowing why.\n\nEven when using elixirs to wash and refine, the ore may dissolve slightly, turning to dust or ash, carried away by the liquid. If not properly managed, this loss will accumulate, and the mercury will fully transform into red silver.\n\nLater scholars, seeing no results, abandon the method entirely, all assuming it is merely mercury—yet they are mistaken. Another tradition holds that even a **jīn** of mercury yields only iron, and iron naturally has an iridescence. When mixed with **qīnglǜ** and other dyes, it retains this flaw, making refinement difficult—no different from copper.\n\nModern practitioners of alchemical **Dào** (道, *Way*) find this method arduous and thus neglect it. Yet I have deeply studied and refined this technique, and it proves most worthy.\n\nIndeed, mercury extracts only the purest essence of iron. If one claims mercury remains unchanged, they stray far from the Dao. If instead one seeks iron’s essence, it is the finest iron of all. When cast into mirrors, it produces mirrors of superior clarity, far surpassing ordinary ones—evidence of its purity.\n\nHow else does one know this? Mercury is the most potent of all, capable of purifying impurities. When it interacts with these minerals, they are all refined into the quintessence of the five metals.\n\nUpon refining, the crucible’s iron surface is undamaged, not even a hair’s breadth lost. Later, through the elixir’s power, mercury draws the iron’s essence, merging with it in a manner so wondrous that it defies explanation. When used to cast mirrors, it becomes an object beyond ordinary comprehension.\n\nYet today’s practitioners dismiss it as mere mercury, unaware of its iron essence. I lament my own shallow skill and inadequate understanding of **Huángdì**’s (黄帝, *Yellow Emperor*) methods. If I were to apply **jīn gāo** (金膏, *gold ointment*) and **xiónghuáng** (雄黄, *realgar*), refining it as per the ancient formulas, its brilliance would rival that of a **yīngwǔ** (鹦鹉, *parrot’s feather*—a fine, lustrous cinnabar), surpassing even the mirrors of antiquity.\n\nNow, if cast into bronze, it would still produce iron of the highest grade transformed into copper. Yet today’s scholars call it only **hóngyín** (红银, *red silver*), seeing its iridescence and treating it like common copper, unaware that it is the refined essence of the five metals.\n\nI consider **hóngyín** (red silver) as both iron and copper, and the method of turning iron into silver through mercury. With the formulas perfected, the principles are now clear.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar into Red Silver:**\nTake **zhūshā** (朱砂, *cinnabar*) one **jīn**, preferably of bright hue and not needing to be granulated. Place it into **cāizhǐ** (猜脂, *a type of animal fat or wax*), mix with water, and boil for thirty-five days. Then immerse it in **mìshuǐ** (蜜水, *honey water*) and boil for another fifteen days.\n\nNext, transfer it to the **Huápó** (华池, *Refined Pool*—likely a mercury solution). After seven days, melt **qiān** (铅, *lead*) in a **gāntǔ** (甘土, *sweet clay*) crucible, pour it into the mixture, and add the **zhūshā**, wrapped in **fánní** (矾泥, *alum clay*). Stir until it sinks to the bottom, then subdue it in fire for seven days.\n\nUpon adding **chìtǔ** (赤土, *red earth*), **huángfán** (黄矾, *yellow alum*), and **zhuōshā** (硵砂, *a type of sulfur or alum*), the color emerges, forming **hóngyín** (红银, *red silver*), also called **hóngjīn** (红金, *red gold*). Its exterior is white, while its interior glows faintly red, radiant and attractive.\n\n**Another Method:**\nTake **shuǐyín** (水银, *mercury*) one **jīn**, and burn **shǐliúhuáng** (石硫黄, *sulfur*) into sand without further refining or washing. Crush the sand and place it in a double-layered silk bag, then wrap it again in a bamboo mesh sack.\n\nExtract the juice of **sānghuī** (桑灰, *mulberry ash*) and **chìwūzuǒ** (赤乌左味, *a type of red medicinal substance*). Suspend the bag in the liquid, ensuring it does not touch the bottom. Add **huángdān** (黄丹, *yellow realgar*) one **jīn**, and refine with gentle fire like the eye of a fish for seven days.\n\nLater, smelt the contents in a crucible, and they will all turn into **hóngyín** (红银, *red silver*), resembling peach blossoms, vivid and pleasing.\n\n**Method for Refining Green into Red Silver:**\nGreen minerals come in many varieties, with **zāngqīng** (曾青, *a type of verdigris*) being the finest. Its form is like **huánglián** (黄连, *coptis*), or small **guàn xiǎo zhēnzhū** (贯小真珠, *strung pearls*), one to three inches long, sometimes paired in twos or threes, either straight or curved, deep or bright green, often with golden threads coiled within, shimmering like fine silk.\n\n**Jùróng** (句容) mountains yield this, though it is now exceedingly rare and costs more than gold. Its hollow variety comes from **Zǐzhōu** (梓州), with a central cavity, its color a vivid, bright green, and its interior containing water.\n\nThe **Kūnlún** (昆仑) **tóuqīng** (头青, *head green*) resembles **yángméi** (杨梅, *wax myrtle*), with a jagged peak, large specimens like small shot, and a solid core.\n\nThe green minerals of **Jùróng** and **Zǐzhōu** can be broken into fragments like shattered bowls, their color a plain green without luster. Even these can be selected and used.",

This single substance is called *white ganqīng* by the local people; neither ancient Daoist prescriptions nor the *Běn cǎo* (本草, *Fundamental Herbal*) records mention it.\n\nThere are also **cháng piānqīng** (长偏青, *long-biased green*), **bái qīng** (白青, *white green*), **yú mù** (鱼目, *fish-eye green*), and **shàn qīng** (善青, *fine green*) in powder form, all from **Ráo xìn** (饶信, *Raoxin*) and similar regions, resembling one another and also akin to the *ganqing* above.\n\nNow, the method for **jié shāzi** (结砂子, *congealed sand method*) uses this: **bái shànqīng** (白善青, *white fine green*) one pound, powdered; **shí nǎo** (石脑, *stone brain*) half a pound, cooked in vinegar; and **shuǐ yín** (水银, *mercury*) one pound. Mix these ingredients thoroughly in vinegar paste, then place in a flat-bottomed wok over gentle fire until the *yú mù* (鱼目) has settled below the boiling point. Gradually add more vinegar paste and water, ensuring it does not boil, and let it simmer for one *fú* (伏, *double-hour*). When done, it will all congeal into sand.\n\nAlternatively, one can add water to the wok’s mixture and boil it vigorously for three days, yielding an even finer result. The substance will also become slightly more translucent.\n\nHowever, one may directly extract **shēng gǔ zhù** (生鼓铸, *raw congealed mercury*), producing about six *liǎng* (两, *troy ounces*) of **hóng yín** (红银, *red mercury*). Generally, when using *qīng* (青, *green minerals*), one does not mix in **shí dǎn** (石胆, *stone gall*), **tǔ lǜ** (土绿, *earth green*), etc., as this slightly reduces its potency.\n\nAnother method:\nTake **qīng** (青, *green minerals*) two *liǎng* (两, *troy ounces*) of the finer variety, **bái fán** (白矾, *white alum*) six *liǎng*, **jùróng dǎnzi** (句容胆子, *Jùróng stone gall*) six *liǎng*, and **shuǐ yín** (水银, *mercury*) one pound. Grind all into fine powder, mix with mercury, and follow the usual method to congeal it. Then add **hēi dòu pí** (黑豆皮, *black soybean husks*) four *liǎng* to ensure the final product has no translucence.\n\nFor **qīnghuā jié shāzi** (青花结砂子, *blue-green congealed sand method*):\nTake **qīnghuā** (青花, *blue-green flower*) one pound and **bái fán** (白矾, *white alum*) four *liǎng*. First mix these evenly, then take two spoonfuls and thoroughly grind them with mercury. Place in the wok and boil vigorously until it reaches thirty to fifty bubbles. Remove, wash once, and let the patterns fully settle. Directly extract the **shēng gǔ zhù** (生鼓铸, *raw congealed mercury*), yielding a very faint red hue.\n\nThe method for **shí dǎn hóng yín** (石胆红银, *stone gall red mercury*):\n**Shí dǎn** (石胆, *stone gall*) grows naturally in the valleys of **Púzhōu** (蒲州). Its form resembles a broken comb, with a shallow, pale green color. When burned, it turns white—this is the true variety.\n\nThe inferior kind comes from **Xuānrùn** (宣润) and similar regions, where its juice is extracted and refined through boiling. The superior grade is a bright green, forming blocks or flakes of varying quality. The lower grade resembles damp yellow mud, known as **ní dǎn** (泥胆, *mud gall*), and can only be mixed with mercury and burned into powder.\n\nThe **Xuānzhōu** (宣州) variety is not as potent as **Jùróng** (句容). Their *qi* (气) and efficacy differ greatly—the **Jùróng** (句容) type is ten times stronger.\n\nThe finest **Jùróng** (句容) **shí dǎn** (石胆) resembles shattered tiles, is dense and heavy, with a vivid green hue half-tinged in deep emerald. It is highly prized, unaffected by summer heat or wind exposure.\n\nThe **Púzhōu** (蒲州) variety is commonly used for the *jié shāzi* (结砂子) method.

      "translated_text": "「The medicine takes one full cooking to congeal, after which it can be refined, though it is generally better to let it settle longer.\n\nFor *jùróng* (句容) mercury, two *liǎng* (两) portions are added per batch, which is acceptable.\n\nWhen the medicine is abundant, the sand yield is likewise greater. The secret lies in this: the water must be shallow, and the fire gentle—this is the key to success.\n\nThis method employs only pure water, no other medicines. The congealing happens as it is prepared, differing from other methods, and is truly superior.\n\nTo begin, blow gently across the water’s surface until it ripples, then watch as the mercury spreads evenly, like a thin pancake covering the base of the pan.\n\nWhen heating, pay close attention as the mercury rises straight up to the pan’s four sides—this proves the medicine’s *virtue/power* (气) has transformed it.\n\nWhen collecting the sand, use a porcelain shard to scrape the bottom of the pan thoroughly, gathering it batch by batch until all is exhausted. If using a *tiàozi* (跳子) sieve, refining mid-process is also effective.\n\nAnother account states: At first, the stone *dǎn* (胆) sand must exhibit a *yùn* (晕) glow. Simply rinse and wash it with warm water to purify it; avoid mixing it with other medicines when boiling. If other medicines are added, their colors will cling to the sand’s original *yùn*, and the goal will not be achieved—do not use it lightly.\n\nIf boiling is necessary, only white alum may be added, and it must be done in a porcelain vessel.\n\n**Method for refining stone *dǎn* (胆) sand:**\nTake *jùróng* mercury (胆子) one *jīn* (斤), alum one *dàhé* (大合), and mercury one *jīn*—all mixed and ground until no stars remain. Place in the pan with seven-tenths of a *hé* (合) of water and boil gently until it reaches the point of effervescence.\n\nThen transfer to a sand pan, using a single *sīn* (筋) branch to allow ventilation. Periodically add water to the sand pan, letting it drip slowly until the water disperses. After two days, six *liǎng* (两) or more of sand should be obtained.\n\nIf an additional half *jīn* (斤) or even one *jīn* is used, take the previously refined sand and congeal it again, retaining the earlier medicine broth for repeated boiling. After two successive refinings, add the broth to fresh water and boil for three more days—this is even more refined.\n\nThe sand will yield twice as much, but the *yùn* (晕) glow will be lighter, with one batch producing a clear *yùn*.\n\nThe secret states: If stone *dǎn* (胆) sand has been refined, re-boiling it with fresh stone *dǎn* (胆) can remove the *yùn* (晕), proving that deeper refinement through repeated boiling and congealing is truly marvelous.\n\n**Method for refining mercury sand:**\nTake ten *jīn* (斤) of *Xuānzhōu* stone *dǎn* (胆). If the mercury is not fully refined, add three to five *jīn* more. The method remains unchanged, using only stone *dǎn* (胆)—no other medicines. If other medicines are added, the *yùn* (晕) will be harder to remove, and the refined sand will not differ from the usual method.\n\nOnce all is refined, take the sand and refine it vigorously to remove any impurities, ensuring it is fully pure.\n\nBoil it with *bámò* (拔莫) root for two to three days—it will turn the color of coarse paper. Then add yellow earth and boil again for two to three days—it will become as white as snow, retaining traces of mercury, resembling three stages of refinement.\n\nThe first is called *jījié* (鸡厥), where the root nodes do not align, and the stems are long and thick. The second is *kǔzhàng* (苦杖), with sparse, coarse leaves—these are useless. The *bámò* (拔莫) root is slightly tighter, with fine nodes that align, round leaves, and short, slender sprouts. This medicine’s *yùn* (晕) glow is unmatched, and it congeals perfectly.\n\nI once saw this root refined at the same time, and the sand turned white immediately. Even more, when boiling this medicine, only the stone *dǎn* (胆) *yùn* (晕) appears—other medicines do not correspond.\n\nAnother account says: First, boil the *bámò* (拔莫) root in a separate vessel to make it thick and concentrated, then add it to the boiling sand—this is also effective.\n\nOne text states: Boiling for a month guarantees whiteness.\n\nAnother account says: The *jīngāng* (金刚) root from silver mines, which is red, and the vines that are three to five *chǐ* (尺) tall, possess the function of controlling mercury. Known as *yínmiáo* (银苗), it grows on silver mountains—this is the best.\n\nFor every *jīn* (斤) of refined sand, including the post-refining re-boiling, sixteen *jīn* of the vine are used. After boiling, the vine is fried and steeped for three days, then left to rest near the fire. The method for steeping the medicine broth uses pure water from *Chìwū* (赤乌), along with one *jīn* of yellow alum. The two are mixed and ground thoroughly for use.\n\n**Method for congealing mercury with stone *dǎn* (胆):**\nThis method, along with *zhuǎndǎn* (转胆子) for red silver, is recorded here.\n\nTake one *liǎng* (两) of mercury and one *liǎng* of stone *dǎn* (胆), along with two *hé* (合) of the previous medicine, and mix them. Boil gently with fire for half a day.\n\nThen add half a *liǎng* of stone *dǎn* (胆) powder, gradually introducing rice vinegar while boiling—*do not* let it boil over. Continuously refine and collect the sand until the mercury is fully exhausted.\n\nAgain, boil the sand with five *liǎng* of stone *dǎn* (胆) powder for five days and nights—when complete, the medicine will resemble tea powder. One *liǎng* of powder can congeal three *liǎng* of mercury into sand.\n\nIf prepared as medicine for seven days, one *liǎng* of powder can congeal four *liǎng* of mercury. On the twelfth day, one *liǎng* of powder can congeal seven *liǎng* of mercury.\n\nThe fire may be slightly more intense once the sand has formed—if the sand is already refined, even a quicker flame poses no harm.\n\n**Method for refining red silver with *tǔlǜ* (土绿):**\nThere are several kinds of *tǔlǜ* (土绿). Found in *Xuānzhōu* (宣州), *Ráoxìn* (饶信州), and *Dàoyǒng* (道永) mountainous regions, it grows wherever copper is present.\n\nDig it from copper pits, where it is unearthed from the soil. After exposure to rain, it grows, appearing soft and pale, like crumbled *húfěn* (胡粉, orpiment). The best is when it crumbles to powder with a touch; the second-best is when it is hard like soft stone.\n\nIn the north, it resembles settled green rice flour—soft, fine, and without residue—and has a pleasing hue.\n\n**Refining red silver sand with *tǔlǜ* (土绿):**\nFor *Dàoyǒng* (道永) *tǔlǜ* (土绿), use half a *jīn* (斤) of the soft variety, or slightly more. Take two *liǎng* (两) of alum, four *liǎng* of white alum, and one *jīn* of mercury—first grind the alum with rice vinegar, then mix and grind the mercury thoroughly until no stars remain.\n\nNext, use an iron spoon to transfer the mixture into the pan, spreading it like fish skin. Then lay a flat cloth at the bottom of the pan, leaving a one-inch gap in the center—*do not* let it touch.\n\nUse a vinegar-flavored paste to moisten the powder before boiling. Add two *liǎng* of white alum and one *liǎng* of salt, all ground into powder. After placing the cloth and medicine in the pan and adding water, sprinkle the powdered medicine evenly atop the mercury mixture. The water level should barely submerge the mixture by one finger’s breadth. Apply a fire just below the gentle *yúyǎn* (鱼眼, fish-eye) heat, ensuring the pan’s base remains warm enough to hold by hand.»",

      "translated_text": "After half a day, gradually increase the fire so that it is like the small fish-eye below, sparse and flickering. Another half day of gentle heat, then gradually increase the fire again, keeping it constantly like a fish-eye. After half a day, add more fire and water to boil. After another half day, when the heat reaches two *fú* (伏, layers of heat), the mixture will become sand-like.\n\nOne method states: when it first congeals, take three or two *liǎng* (两) of the congealed sand, crush it into small pieces, and scatter them into the pan. Initially, this causes a hook-like reaction. Once all the sand has formed, lay it at the bottom of the pan, adding one *jīn* (斤) or half a *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), and boil it for another day or two. The yield of sand will double, and the darkening around its edges will fade.\n\nAnother method says: simply use the congealed medicine liquid from before—do not discard it, but collect and boil it again to form sand, which is also said to double in quantity, and the darkening will fade.\n\nAll of this is then transferred to a mortar for grinding. Rinse with water to extract the pure essence, repeatedly pounding until you obtain ten *liǎng* of refined sand.\n\nThe method for forming sand-like *hóng yín* (红银, red silver) originates from Master Liu. Use *qīng fán* (青矾, green vitriol) five *liǎng*, the finest from the Northern lands, one *jīn* of mercury, and one *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar). The Northern *tǔ lǜ* resembles settled green rice flour in texture, soft and fine, with no impurities.\n\nTake these ingredients, place them in a mortar, grind with vinegar until thoroughly mixed, and transfer to a new pan. The pan should not be scoured or polished. Boil with intense fire (*wǔ huǒ*, 武火) for one *fú*, until it becomes dry sand, with no trace of mercury residue. At this point, you should have twenty *liǎng* of sand.\n\nNext, take this sand and place it in a sand basin, adding white alum to boil for a day. Then grind it with *bàng fěn* (蚌粉, mother-of-pearl powder), rinsing three times. Mix again with alum and grind for half a day, then boil with white alum and *wū méi* (乌梅, black plum) for a day. Finally, boil with *sāng táng* (砂糖, rock sugar) for a day and with *zào jiá* (皂荚, soapberry) for another day. After each step, grind and rinse out the black impurities until it is completely pure.\n\nAdd one *liǎng* of *huáng dān* (黄丹, litharge), then grind together. After grinding, parch and refine it again, then add one *liǎng* of frost (*shuāng*, 霜), grinding until thoroughly mixed. Divide into sixteen portions, wrap each with salt, and pierce them into small conical shapes (*xiǎo kǒu zǐ*, 小孔子). Dry them under the sun until completely desiccated. Place them in a furnace or on a pan, covering with ash. Initially, nurture with gentle heat for a day, then apply intense fire, heating the crucible’s base until it turns red. Once cooled, the frost within will dissolve, leaving only the mercury. Collect the sand-like globules (*qiú zǐ*, 球子) from the pan, yielding four *liǎng* of red silver.\n\nThis is the common grade—its color fades by half, and when struck, it makes no sound, being very soft. When ignited, it emits only a faint, shallow smoke.\n\nThe revered teacher said: the frost generated within the globules causes the sand to fully congeal, becoming as white as jade. This is the supreme grade of the Daoist elixir.\n\nThe method for forming sand-like red silver:\nTake one *jīn* of *niè shā* (硵砂, calcined realgar), one *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), and one *jīn* of white alum. Grind these three ingredients together, place them in a bottle, and seal with a thin layer of alum paste. Nurture and heat for one *fú*. When nearly finished, apply a strong fire to complete the process. Use one *dǒu* (斗) of wind-sifted ash and one *dǒu* of *chì wū* (赤乌, red crow medicine, possibly red lead or cinnabar), mix with vinegar paste and water to dissolve the ash, then strain to obtain clear lime water. Boil the lime water until hot, pour over the *chì wū*, and extract the liquid to refine the sand.\n\nThe mercury should first be treated with ten *liǎng* of refined medicine, ground and placed in the pan, congealed for one *fú*. Once all the salt residue is exhausted, transfer it to the pan and use the same method as forming sand, but even more refined. Stir it occasionally without overdoing so.\n\nAfter one *fú*, it will fully congeal into sand, with no trace of raw mercury. Rinse again, then add four or five *liǎng* of refined medicine, congealing it repeatedly until fully refined—this is beyond description.\n\nFor each *jīn* of this, add four *liǎng* of white lead (*bái qiān*, 白铅), stir and refine in a crucible, pour into a mold, and flatten it into a *tuó* (砣, pestle). Then place the pestle in ash and burn it fiercely, using a bellows to blow as well. This should be shaped into a perforated lead mold (*kǒng lòu kuàng qiān*, 孔镂铿铅), poured into the ash, leaving only the red silver.\n\nRefine it again in a crucible, pour lead into the crucible to thin it, and then strain it through ash three times. The lead will be fully exhausted, leaving only the red silver. Rinse it again in a crucible with *bì tǔ* (壁土, furnace clay) and a little salt, then strain and remove the remaining lead, which will be clean.\n\nThe darkening will be minimal, and the substance very soft. Another method states: mix this with *dān yáng* (丹阳, possibly a type of cinnabar or red lead) and silver, in a ratio of three parts to one, and it will be even better.\n\nThe method for white lead (*bái qiān*):\nTake one *jīn* of lead, mix with two *jīn* of raw *sōng zhī* (松脂, pine resin). Parch the lead with intense fire until it becomes liquid, then add a small amount of resin and a little salt, stirring thoroughly. Continue adding resin and alum until the resin is evenly distributed throughout the lead, which should now be entirely transformed into ash powder. This can then be used as a measure (*dù*, 度). Place it in a sweet crucible, pound into liquid, and you will obtain over ten *liǎng* of white lead, resembling snow.\n\nThe method for forming sand:\nTake one *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), five *liǎng* of white alum, and five *hé* (合) of alum. Grind all together, mix with one *jīn* of fine yellow soil and *zhǐ sīn* (纸筋, paper fiber) to form a paste, and shape it into a box about two *cùn* (寸) thick. Wrap the previous mixture inside this box, allowing it to dry gradually, then bake with intense fire without breaking the box.\n\nWhen cooled, it will turn a purple-red color and yield one *jīn* of sand. Grind the mercury together with it for an hour, stirring continuously. This medicine can be repeatedly used to form sand in quantities of ten *jīn* or twenty *jīn*. Each *jīn* of *tǔ lǜ* can be divided into two, with the box of yellow soil as the standard.\n\nThe *Huá Chí* (华池) method: mix stone lime with good wine and stir thoroughly, using it like a thin pancake.\n\nAnother method states: whenever forming sand with *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), mix it with yellow soil to congeal.\n\nAnother prescription:\nTake two *jīn* of *tǔ gōng* (土汞, calx of mercury), and eight *liǎng* of white alum. Grind them together, then add two *shēng* (升) of rice vinegar, sprinkling it gradually while parching until fully refined. If no rice vinegar is available, use good bran vinegar instead. Grind the mixture into powder, then take half of it and mix with one *jīn* of mercury, grinding until thoroughly combined. Place it in a flat-bottomed pan, keeping it submerged in vinegar paste to a depth of one *cùn* (寸). Boil like a fish-eye until it reaches a rolling boil for half a day, and it will fully congeal into sand, with no trace of raw mercury remaining.",
      "overlap_context": "do not* let it touch.\n\nUse a vinegar-flavored paste to moisten the powder before boiling. Add two *liǎng* of white alum and one *liǎng* of salt, all ground into powder. After placing the cloth and medicine in the pan and adding water, sprinkle the powdered medicine evenly atop the mercury mixture. The water level should barely submerge the mixture by one finger’s breadth. Apply a fire just below the gentle *yúyǎn* (鱼眼, fish-eye) heat, ensuring the pan’s base remains warm enough to hold by hand.»",

      "translated_text": "If no brine is available, mix vinegar with water instead.\n\nOnce refined, take the sand again and, following the previous method, add one *jīn* of medicine, blending and grinding thoroughly. Cook and congeal it as before—it also requires half a day.\n\nThen sift and wash until pure, and extract the *shēngshēng* (生生, vital essence) by pounding and casting. The yield will be about seven *liǎng* (两), which is excellent.\n\nThis is not the common method.\n\n**Prescription for Congealing Sand:**\n\nTake approximately three *dǒu* (斗) of mulberry twig ash, sift with bamboo grass through hot water, and collect three *dǒu* of the heavier sediment, roughly equivalent to two large *dǒu* in volume, each weighing eight *jīn* (斤).\nIf the lumps are too large, break them into the size of a *dànzi* (弹子, marble), but do not grind them finely—fear that the sediment will not pass through the sifting, making it difficult to refine.\nThe ash should be sifted through hot water until the liquid turns a deep red—this is not acceptable. If it turns a greenish hue, it is suitable for use.\n\nUse this liquid to sift the ash, and place three *shēng* (升) of mercury in a crucible, cooking it for three days. Add the liquid to soak it repeatedly, as in the usual method, but ensure it is tightly sealed.\nThen apply *píhuáng fēishuāng* (砒黄飞霜, arsenic sublimate) three times, mixing it with mercury.\nTake a bamboo tube, remove its skin, and cut it into strips about two sheets of paper thick, with a length of over three *cùn* (寸).\nPour the prepared ash liquid into the tube, filling it completely, and also fill a flat-bottomed pan with the same liquid. If the liquid in the tube turns black, pour it out.\nRepeat this process three times—even with bitter vinegar, the same method applies.\nSift the stone lime (石灰) through hot water to obtain a clear liquid as before.\nMix it with bitter vinegar, following the method of *sìshén dān* (四神丹, Four Spirits Pill) sublimation, until a frost forms.\n\nUse *tǎiyáng* (太阳, cinnabar), *tǎiyīn* (太阴, realgar), *xuánjīng* (玄精, refined realgar), and *huángfán shí* (黄矾石, yellow alum) that resembles gold in color—all of the highest quality.\nUse *qīngshā* (硵砂, green arsenic) that is blackish-green—also of the highest quality.\nCombine these five ingredients into a powder, place them in a mortar, and pound them finely. Spread the powder around the edges of a secondary pan, about the thickness of a grain of rice, and cover the center similarly.\nUse charcoal to seal and roast it for one *fúshí* (伏时, hour), with a ratio of eight parts gentle fire to four parts strong fire. Do not exceed one *jīn* of charcoal—if done too quickly, it will not be usable.\nOnce frost is obtained and it turns white, soften it with fire, then twist it into strips as thick as two sheets of paper. Wrap these strips around the upper material to form pills, each the size of a small *dànzi* (弹子, marble).\nThen use five *hé* (合) of lime to create a pool, with six *shēng* (升) or more. Place the pills in a crucible and melt them, adding them to the pool until three pills are immersed per batch. Repeat this process five times.\n\nAfterward, use *bóshàng kè* (博上克, refined borax) to mark the surface, creating a mold. Apply oil to smooth it, ensuring it is very moist and can be easily removed.\nIt is also said: First, add the refined white alum ash as a marvelous aid.\nThe method involves burning a pit with mulberry wood, sweeping it thoroughly clean, mixing the lime with bitter vinegar, and while it is still hot, placing dry alum in the pit to cover it. Seal it tightly.\nWhen the *líng* (玲, condensation) opens, add one *liǎng* (两) to every *jīn* (斤). First, roast it in a pan until dry, then place it in the pit for softening before applying the frost—do not form pills.\n\n**Prescription for Congealing Red Silver:**\n\nTake five *liǎng* (两) of *tǔ lǜ* (土绿, cinnabar), preferably green and soft, such that when rubbed between the hands it feels like *húfěn* (胡粉, powdered lead).\nAlso take five *liǎng* (两) or more of white alum.\nAnd half a *jīn* (斤) or less of *chìwū* (赤乌, red arsenic)—also acceptable.\n\nCombine one *jīn* (斤) of mercury with these ingredients, blending and grinding thoroughly. Place the mixture in a pan and cook it with gentle fire for half a day until noon, when the full heat is applied. It will congeal into sand.\nThen, extract the *shēngshēng* (生生, vital essence) by pounding and casting—only about four *liǎng* (两) will be obtained.\n\nBefore casting, lay a layer of salt in the bottom of the pan, about one *cùn* (寸) thick. Spread the finely ground white alum powder in the center of the salt, sparingly. Wrap the sand in thin silk, twisting it so that it adheres to the salt. Once the silk is just wrapped around the sand, stop—do not let it remain loose.\nPlace the pan inside another, then cover the sand with another layer of salt-wrapped silk. Immediately stir the salt, pressing it down to form a tight crust. Roast it with strong fire for half a day.\n\n**Later Method:**\n\nTake one *jīn* (斤) of mercury,\nsix *liǎng* (两) of *lǜzi* (绿子, green arsenic),\nand two *liǎng* (两) of *chìshí zhī* (赤石脂, red pitchstone).\nAdd two *liǎng* (两) of lead (铅), which should be added gradually.\n\nGrind these three ingredients together in a mortar with a small amount of salt, pounding them about a hundred times.\nWhen the pan boils, use an iron spoon to stir the mixture down into it. Cook with strong fire from the *yín* (寅, 3 AM) hour until the *chén* (辰, 7 AM) hour, and the silver threads will be obtained.\nFor one *jīn* (斤) of mercury, add one *liǎng* (两) of *huángdān* (黄丹, cinnabar), parch and grind it together. Extract the *shēngshēng* (生生, vital essence) immediately after.\n\n**Method for Extracting Mercury by Sublimation:**\n\nTake the sand and place it in a crucible with *hánshuǐ shí* (寒水石, alum) as a barrier, but keep the layer thin. If the sand touches the alum, layer them thickly.\nCover the top with salt, and then with ash.\nSeal it tightly and sublimate with gentle and strong fire until the bottom of the crucible is reached.\nThe alum must then be burned once more with fire, turning it completely red. Immediately remove it from the fire, cover it with a basin, and seal the edges.\nWhen the *líng* (玲, condensation) opens, it will be ready for use.\n\n**Method for Casting Sand:**\n\nTake a crucible and place the sand at its base. Pour a thin layer of moistened liquid over it, filling the crucible completely and pressing it down tightly. Then roast it by the fire until the liquid is dry.\nPlace the crucible over a bottle mouth in a pit on the ground, with a small amount of water inside. Seal it with sinew and clay, gradually increasing the heat until the crucible is heated. Apply a strong fire, then quickly remove it when the condensation opens.\n\nIn general, after casting the sand, the extracted vital mercury (*shēngshēng*, 生生) should first be boiled with vinegar.\nThen, wash it with warm vinegar and warm water, and finally grind it with salt to achieve the proper sequence.\n\n**Prescription for Red Arsenic Sand:**\n\n*Chìwū* (赤乌, red arsenic) is the sediment of *níchūn* (腻粉, refined lead powder), originally made from mud gall and salt.\nThe *huáinán* (淮南, southern variety) is superior to the northern one, and fresh, good-quality material is best.\nIf it has been stored for a long time or left on the ground, its potency will be diminished. Each *dǒu* (斗) should weigh eight *jīn* (斤).\nThe tightly compacted variety is superior.\n\nTake any quantity of *chìwū* (赤乌), place it in a large porcelain container filled with boiling water, and stir it until evenly dispersed. Use a small wooden pestle to grind and stir it until smooth, then break it up in the hot water. Add it all together to the hot water.\nOnce it is completely dispersed into fine particles, immerse it in clear water—this will not hinder the process.\nFill the porcelain container and let it settle for one day and night; it will become clear.\nUse a tool to skim off the clear liquid on top—do not use the thick, turbid portion. Place it in a pot and boil for the duration of a meal. Then, with a thin-mouthed ladle at the bottom of the pot, scrape and collect the sand.",

      "translated_text": "The sand resembles silkworm excrement (*cánshā* 蚕砂), being very light and soft. Place it in a single porcelain bowl, with a small amount of medicinal liquid in the bowl to nurture the sand. Skim it repeatedly until the liquid is exhausted.\n\nIf the broth in the pot is insufficient, add more, but also until it is exhausted. When the water in the bowl is depleted, add fresh water, stir thoroughly with a tool, and wait until it clarifies again before boiling. Even if some sand remains settled in the bowl, do not use it beyond its exhaustion.\n\nOnce all is collected, the broth in the pot will total only one or two *dǒu* (斗). Then extinguish the fire, remove the pot, and set it in a bright place. The sediment at the bottom of the pot is known as *rénxī* (人询), which should be gathered the following day, just like the earlier portion.\n\nAfter gathering all the sand, store it in a porcelain bottle. Reboil it with *chìwū* (赤乌) broth, simmering for four *fú* (伏) periods, stirring frequently. Once a day, grind and wash it. Then discard the remaining mercury (*tóng* 铜, here meaning *gōngtóng* 锌汞, \"quicksilver\") and collect the sand, which will be minimal.\n\nIf not ground and washed nor frequently stirred, but simply kept from settling, the sand will fully solidify. Another account states: When measuring the clear water, each *shēng* (升) weighs one *liǎng* (两). To prepare it later, first weigh the water, then take the *chìwū* clear water, and weigh it to determine the quantity.\n\nAnother method: Boil the sand with the concentrated broth for four *fú* periods, stirring it repeatedly and ensuring it never settles. The fire must be strong (*wǔ* 武). Every time one *fú* period passes, skim off the thick, impure, and old broth, then add fresh broth to continue boiling. When the boiling day is complete, bind the sand and let it dry, then weigh to know its quantity.\n\nAnother prescription reads: Boil the sand for four *fú* periods. The resulting *yùn* (晕, \"vaporous residue\") is taken—one *liǎng* (两) of this sand is added to two *liǎng* of mercury (*gōngtóng* 锌汞), cooked with *zàojiá méi* (皂荚梅浆, \"soapberry and plum juice\"), differing from other methods of producing *yùn*.\n\nIf no additional gold is desired, it is called *hóngjīn* (红金). The prescription states this method.\n\nAnother account says: Boil all the *chìwū* (赤乌) broth together in the pot, never skimming or scraping it. When the broth is exhausted in a day, the sand will naturally settle at the bottom of the pot, and you may collect it as you wish.\n\nWhen the broth has been boiled, place it in a ceramic basin (*wǎpén* 瓦盆). After a night, it will solidify into long, thick *xiāoshí* (消石, \"calcined alum\") rods, over a *chǐ* (尺) in length, as thick as two fingers, white in color, and with the same texture as *xiāoshí*. Even when exposed to wind, it will not dissolve or change. Some call it *báishídǎn* (白石胆, \"white stone gall\").\n\nIt is said that if the sand is solidified without any *yùn* (晕), it can also be used for refining.\n\nAgain, if the medicinal broth from previous boiling is used to paint on bricks or stones, it will appear as an empty green (*qīng* 青) color, remaining unchanged for a long time.\n\n**Method for Solidifying *Chìwū* Sand (赤乌砂子法)**\nTake two *dǒu* (斗) of *tīnggǔ* (厅谷) husks and layer them with *chìwū* (赤乌). Then press the *chìwū* with a small amount of husks, ensuring they are well-mixed. After one pressing and washing, it will settle like sediment (*tíng* 停). The next day, it will become mud (*ní* 泥).\n\nThe broth must be skimmed until fully exhausted, then separately clarified and set aside. The resulting solidified sand will have more *yùn* (晕), but it is unclear why.\n\nIn my opinion, it may be difficult to skim, so the previous method is preferable. Another thought: When mixing the sand earlier, add *jūróngdǎn* (句容胆子, \"Jurong stone gall\") during boiling. This should make it easier to solidify with less *yùn*, and *liáo* (寥) ash is also suitable—it is the finest method.\n\nSimply follow the earlier major method for boiling the sand, then boil it again with *liáo* ash—this is the superior approach.\n\nAnother account from an elder (*sùshàngrén* 宿上人) states: When boiling *chìwū* (赤乌), after one pressing, boil it at the bottom of the pot, collect the sand, and then place it in *chái* (柴) ash. Boil for three *fú* periods, and it will become excellent dry sand, yielding over ten *liǎng* (两) per *jīn* (斤). Later, *Cuī Zhōngshēng* (崔中丞) used this to craft gold instruments, obtaining over forty or fifty *liǎng* of sand at once. He then added it to gold in one go, successfully removing the impurities from the gold—an excellent result.\n\nThus, it is known that the earlier claim that this sand can be added to gold is not unfounded.\n\nThis substance is extremely soft, even softer than other red golds (*hóngjīn* 红金), and softer than gold and silver (*jīnyín* 金银).\n\nAnother method: Take three *jīn* (斤) of mercury (*gōngtóng* 锌汞), place it in a sand basin (*shāpénzi* 砂盆子), and mix with *chìwū* (赤乌) and concentrated vinegar (*niècuì* 酽醋). Grind it until it resembles *miǎn* (缅) paste. After two *chuāo* (炊) periods, do not apply fire. Instead, wash it with water, then add more *chìwū* (赤乌) and repeatedly grind with concentrated vinegar. When sand appears in the mercury, collect it until the quantity is sufficient.\n\nAfter thoroughly washing and purifying the sand, boil it with *gānzǐ* (甘子, \"sweet fruit\") and *gāncǎo* (甘草, \"licorice root\"), then remove the *yùn* (晕) and any toxicity. It will yield *yín gāo* (银膏, \"silver paste\").\n\n**Method for Boiling and Solidifying Sand (燠伏砂子法)**\nFor all types of sand, when one *jīn* (斤) of mercury (*gōngtóng* 锌汞) is solidified, the more *fú* (伏) periods used in boiling, the less *yùn* (晕) there will be. This makes refinement easier, and the usual amount is four *liǎng* (两) or less. If one can solidify seven or eight *liǎng* (两) or more, it is truly masterful.\n\nIf skilled in boiling and solidifying, and further refining the mercury, the quantity will increase, or it may become fully solidified, containing no *yùn*—this is the essence of boiling and solidifying.\n\nAnother method: Take sand that requires full solidification, place it in a silk or bamboo mesh bag (*zhǔlǚdài* 疏袋), and boil it with clear *chìwū* (赤乌) water, adding four *liǎng* (两) of *huángdān* (黄丹, \"yellow cinnabar\"). Boil it for seven days.\n\nThen add *chìwū* (赤乌) and simmer until it forms a white *dǎnzi* (胆子, \"stone gall\") for refining. Leave it to solidify for seven days, then fully solidify it with fire—no need to extract the raw material.\n\nAnother method for fully solidifying sand: Take one *jīn* (斤) of raw mercury (*tǔgōngtóng* 土汞) and half a *jīn* of *dǎnzi* (胆子). After solidifying, use the resulting mercury to mix with a small amount of *liáo* (寥) ash, kneading it into a paste for refining. Fix it in a pan (*chēng* 铛) and roast for ten days until fully solidified.\n\nAnother method:\n*Liáo* (寥) ash – one *jīn* (斤)\n*Xiāoshí* (消石) – four *liǎng* (两)\n*Báifàn* (白矾) – four *liǎng* (两)\nCombine these ingredients in a bottle and ignite them until they melt (*róng* 镕).\n\nAfter cooling, take five *liǎng* (两) of *fánshí* (矾石, \"alum stone\") and one *liǎng* (两) of *mìtuó sēng* (蜜陀僧, \"mellite or honeyed alum\"). Mix these and ignite with strong fire (*wǔhuǒ* 武火) for one *fú* period.\n\nThen take the previous mixture, add five *liǎng* (两) of *císhí* (磁石, \"lodestone\"), and knead it into a paste for refining. Roast with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for seven days—this is the finest method.",

      "translated_text": "「If salt is not to be used with *gǔyán* (鼓盐), then this salt, when made into a paste, should first be thoroughly dried over a fire. For each *jīn* (斤) of salt, add five *liǎng* (两) of *fúhuǒ xiāoshí* (伏火消石, \"roasted alumstone\"). In an iron mortar, grind it finely like flour—ensure it is ground to a smooth paste before forming the mixture; there is no need to use *gǔyán* (鼓盐) in this case. Additionally, if the *liáo* (寥) ash is roasted until it turns red, it is superior.\n\nAnother method:\nTake the *yún* (晕, \"haloed\") residue, empty it, and boil it in a solution of *báifàn* (白矾, \"alum\") for the duration of a meal. Then, when refining into silver, it will naturally soften and turn red at the bottom of the pan (*chēng* 铛).\n\nFirst, spread the salt to a thickness of over one *cùn* (寸). Then, finely grind *báifàn* (白矾) powder and sprinkle a little at the center of the *liáo* (寥). Wrap the sand in thin silk, gently twist it to adhere to the wrapped silk, and stop once fully wrapped—ensure no excess silk remains. Even if the refining is complete, place the wrapped sand on the *báifàn* (白矾), covering the silk with a little more *báifàn* (白矾). Quickly remove the salt, unfold the wrapped silk, cover it with a frost basin, and seal it tightly with an iron clamp to ensure no leaks. If the *gǒng* (汞, \"mercury\") force rises and there is any sign of leakage, the mercury will escape. Use strong fire (*wǔhuǒ* 武火) and burn fiercely—this is optimal. From dawn until dusk, remove the fire and wait for it to cool. The basin should contain frost and mercury mixed together. Then, remove the salt and collect the purple powder (*zǐfěn* 紫粉). Strike it with an object to produce a metallic sound—it is then ready for use in the furnace.\n\n**Method for Extracting Red Silver Halo (*hóngyín yún* 红银晕):**\nObtaining red silver halo is extremely difficult. Why? The materials used are not of the highest quality. Even those skilled in refining lead and mercury (*qiān gǒng* 铅汞) may have slight discrepancies in their techniques, let alone attempting to use ordinary stones and herbs as medicines—where raw and processed materials differ so greatly—yet hoping to transform the mundane into the true. How could this not be difficult?\n\nNow, when using these methods, one must carefully distinguish impurities, understand their nature, and measure the ingredients precisely—whether in sequence or proportion. If the process aligns with principle, it will not differ from the genuine. The slightest deviation will lead to failure. Students must study this thoroughly and apply it carefully.\n\n**Method for Washing and Refining Sand Halo (*shāzi yún* 砂子晕):**\nAll colored sands must not be washed with cold water; warm water should be used instead. Avoid mixing with other medicines during grinding, washing, or boiling, as external medicines may bind the sand halo, making extraction even more difficult. First, empty the sand and wash it with warm water—repeat this process several times. Then, add salt and rice gruel, grinding it thoroughly. Use barley grain broth, *wūméi* (乌梅, \"black plum\"), and *liáo* (寥) ash, storing it in a large porcelain container over a chaff fire for ten days until thoroughly decomposed. Before use, add *zhānglù gēn* (章陆根, \"stem of *Achyranthes bidentata*\") and boil the sand until it reaches the desired consistency. After this, it can be used in any refining process.\n\n**Method for Extracting Red Silver Sand Halo (*hóngyín shāzi yún* 红银砂子晕):**\nTake washed sand, shape it into small rods, and place wind-dissolved lime (*fēnghuà shuǐhuā* 风化石灰) in an iron crucible. Insert the rods into the lime and seal the crucible—it may also be left unsealed. Refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for one month or more. After pounding, each *jīn* (斤) yields ten *liǎng* (两) of pure, halo-free product.\n\n**Method for Reviving Halo from Raw Mercury (*chōushēng chūyún* 抽生出晕):**\nTake sand and mix it with two *liǎng* (两) of *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石, \"cold water stone\"), one *liǎng* (两) of *fánshí* (矾石, \"alum stone\"), and one *liǎng* (两) of *zhānglù gēn* (章陆根, \"stem of *Achyranthes bidentata*\") per *jīn* (斤) of sand. Grind them thoroughly together for three to five meals' duration—the more grinding, the better. Wash and repeat the process with the same three ingredients twice more. The halo should now be fully extracted. Then, regenerate the raw mercury (*shēng gǒng* 生汞) and mix it with *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石) paste in the pan (*chēng* 铛), using vinegar as a binder. Place a half-*cùn* (寸) layer of *hánshuǐshí* at the bottom and a one-*cùn* (寸) layer on top, with the sand sandwiched between layers of *hánshuǐshí* powder—or shape it into thin sheets if preferred. Cover with *liáo* (寥) ash and salt, then refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for one *fú* period. Afterward, place it in a crucible and melt it into the *hánshuǐshí* pool.\n\n**Method for Preparing the *Hánshuǐshí* Pool (*shí fǎ* 池法):**\nMix *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石) with saltwater into a paste like *miǎn* (缅, \"Myanmar\") glue, applying it in three layers until it turns as white as snow.\n\n**Method for Roasting *Hánshuǐshí* (烧寒水石法):**\nTake *hánshuǐshí* (寒水石), quickly remove it from the fire, seal the basin tightly, and wait for it to cool before use.\n\n**Method for Pointing Red Silver Halo (*diǎn hóngyín yún* 点红银晕):**\nOne *liǎng* (两) of toxic frost (*dú fēng* 毒霜) and half a *liǎng* (两) of *jùróng dǎnzi* (句容胆子, \"cholecyst from Jurong\")\nMix these finely.\n\nFirst, prepare lime by heating it as in the *lín huī* (淋灰, \"lime leaching\") method and leach it with white horse urine, obtaining about two *shāng* (升) of liquid. Place this in a porcelain bottle. Add the two ingredients, boil with strong fire (*wǔhuǒ* 武火) for two *fú* periods, then cool. Remove the residual liquid and impurities, mix with half a *liǎng* (两) of *fúhuǒ xiāoshí* (伏火消石, \"roasted alumstone\"), and knead into a paste. Place it in a medicine container and refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) for two days. During refining, each *liǎng* (两) of medicine can treat one *jīn* (斤) of material like snow.\n\n**Medicine Container Method (*yàogū fǎ* 药柜法):**\nTwo *liǎng* (两) of raw *fánshí* (矾石, \"alum stone\"),\nHalf a *liǎng* (两) of *qīng* (青, \"indigo\" or \"blue vitriol\"),\nOne *liǎng* (两) of *mìtuó sēng* (蜜陀僧, \"mellite or honeyed alum\"),\nHalf a *liǎng* (两) of *jùróng dǎnzi* (句容胆子, \"cholecyst from Jurong\")\nMix these with vinegar and place them in a small porcelain bottle. Roast for seven days, adding vinegar daily before roasting. This mixture is then ready for use as a container. Repeated use over time improves its efficacy.\n\n**Method for Roasting *Xiāoshí* (伏消石法):**\nTake one *liǎng* (两) of *xiāoshí* (消石, \"alumstone\") and grind it into powder. Place it in a porcelain cup, pressing it flat. Sprinkle two *qián* (钱) of *liáo* (寥) ash on top and press it down evenly. Cover with a porcelain lid without sealing. Refine with alternating strong and gentle fire (*wénwǔhuǒ* 文武火) until the *liáo* (寥) and *xiāoshí* (消石) juices are fully consumed—this completes the roasting.\n\n**Alternative Method for Pointing Red Silver Halo (*diǎn hóngyín yún* 点红银晕):**\nTake eight *liǎng* (两) of lead (*qiān* 铅) and two *liǎng* (两) of mercury (*shuǐyín* 水银), mix them thoroughly, and place them in a porcelain vessel without sealing. Refine with fire until they liquefy like water—do not overheat, only until they reach a liquid state. After ten days, grind into sand. Add *píhuáng* (砒黄, \"orpiment\") along with *xiāoshí* (消石), *báifàn* (白矾), and *liáo* (寥) to extract the halo, washing and grinding it twenty or more times. Then, boil it with halo-extraction medicine for a day, add half a *liǎng* (两) of mercury (*gǒng* 汞) to the lead, and refine with fire for another ten days.",

      "translated_text": "When the mixture is ready for application, blending with frost medicine is also excellent.\n\n**Method for Pointing Red Silver Halo (with Enhanced Whiteness):**\nUse high-quality *píhuáng* (orpiment) for coloring—if unavailable, substitute with aged rat poison. Line a container with ash half an inch thick, then cover with plaster two inches thick, and sublimate for three cycles.\n\nTake one *jīn* (斤) of white frost (*báishuāng*), four *liǎng* (两) of *fú* (伏, \"subdued\") *xiāoshí* (消石), and four *liǎng* (两) of *liúfú* (硫伏, \"subdued sulfur\"). Refine gradually over a day, extracting minimal sulfur. Ideally, let the sulfur subside within the *xiāoshí*.\n\nCombine these two substances, grind thoroughly until fully integrated, and spread evenly in a crucible. Cover with *xiāoshí* powder, sprinkling lightly by hand—use no more than half a *fēn* (分). Seal tightly and sublimate for one cycle. Two *liǎng* (两) will rise to the top; the rest remains below. Scrape down and regrind, then sublimate again. Repeat this process three times, each time ensuring the *xiāoshí* is fresh and refined under subdued fire.\n\nTake three *liǎng* (两) of *Xúzhōu shí nǎo* (徐州石脑, \"Xuzhou mineral essence\"), finely ground, and roast in an iron pan for one *shí* (食, \"meal\") duration—preferably in a copper vessel. Once the fire has fully subsided, immediately pour in five *hé* (合) of concentrated vinegar, stirring vigorously. This is called *cù shí nǎo* (醋石脑, \"vinegar-processed mineral essence\").\n\nQuickly add the subdued frost to the vinegar-processed essence, stirring over the fire until dry. Then take twelve *liǎng* (两) of fresh *xiāoshí* (previously refined under subdued fire), two *liǎng* (两) of *báifàn* (白矾), and grind them together in a bottle. Refine under subdued fire for ten days, heating from above. Finally, apply a single intense blast of fire to liquefy into a juice—now ready for application. For every four *liǎng* (两) of medicine, apply to one *jīn* (斤) of material. The supreme whiteness is achieved as per the *Chí Kǒu Jué* (池口诀, \"Pool-Mouth Secret\"):\n\n*\"The basin must be repeatedly tested with clear water.\"*\n\nIf the applied material turns white, for every *jīn* (斤), add four *liǎng* (两) of the base substance, mix thoroughly, and grind into a fine powder. Add to mercury until forming a paste, then refine until fully integrated. Take one *qián* (钱) of the subdued fire medicine, place in a sand basin, and boil with paste until dissolved. Strain, grind, and discard the black residue—repeat this process three times. By nightfall, reintroduce mercury and a small amount of medicine, dry-roast, and seal. After two days of boiling and two nights of dry-roasting, the result should be pure white with no halo. Test by burning a small amount—its behavior will confirm success.\n\n**Method for Subdued Fire Medicine:**\nFirst, take one *liǎng* (两) of *báifàn* (白矾) and three *fēn* (分) of *pǔ xiāo* (朴消, \"plain *xiāo*\"). Grind these two substances finely, place in a porcelain dish, and arrange as a crucible. Inside, place one *liǎng* (两) of *xiāoshí* powder. Refine gradually with gentle fire for a day, then increase the heat until the crucible glows red—stop immediately.\n\nTake one *liǎng* (两) of mercury, leaving one *fēn* (分) subdued. Combine these two substances, grinding until extremely fine—ideally, grind for an entire day, with meticulous effort yielding the best results. Add half a *liǎng* (两) of the previously subdued *báifàn* and other ingredients, then mix with the mercury medicine, grinding until fully refined.\n\nForm a crucible with *yánhuā* (盐花, \"salt flowers\"), using a bottle. The crucible should be one inch thick. Seal tightly and refine with gentle to vigorous fire for seven days—ten days is even better. Heat from above until the bottle glows red, then stop. The medicine will turn greenish-purple. This single crucible of medicine can transform ten *jīn* (斤) of sand into pure white.\n\nMaster Huò once prepared this method while at the *Lóngxīng Guàn* (龙兴观, \"Dragon Ascension Hall\") in Yángzhōu (扬州).

      "translated_text": "「The method of forming a crucible and removing the *yùn* (晕, \"haze/impurity\")—when the crucible rises and emits a faint haze:\n\n- **Lime (石灰):** 1 part\n- **Yellow soil (黄土):** 2 parts\n- **Salt (盐):** 1 part\n\nCombine these three ingredients to form the **crucible base (挺子)**. Use a stirring crucible (搅埚) and consider the base effective when it no longer emits haze upon heating. Once all haze has dissipated, the residue will be even more potent and can be used repeatedly without limit.\n\nLime is particularly effective in removing haze, but it is brittle and difficult to work with. If using a stirring crucible (搅埚), it is best to stir before adding the **primary substance (母)**. If the primary substance has already been added, stirring may risk damaging the silver.\n\nAnother method: Mix **talc powder (滑石末)** with vinegar (醋) and apply it to the crucible and the base (砣挺). Upon heating, the residue will burn away silently, effectively sealing the haze. A single application suffices—afterward, the haze will not reappear upon heating. It is advisable to conduct this process in a secluded room where no drafts (风) reach.\n\n**Method for removing haze from sand and other substances:**\n\nTake fine sand (砂子) and knead it thoroughly. Mix with **lodestone (磁石)**, **alum (消石)**, **white alum (白矾)**, **pumice (朴消)**, **salt (盐)**, **cold water stone (寒水石)**, and **mother-of-pearl (母蛎)**. Add a small amount of **sticky rice (糯米)** to form a paste, then grind and shape into a **pill (饼)**.\n\nWrap the sand in a layer of cloth (布), knead it until thin, then dig a hole two *chǐ* (尺) deep and bury it for **one hundred days (一百日)**—this will remove the haze. If the haze does not fully dissipate after one hundred days, burying it for a year or more is even better, until the haze is completely gone. Burying without the medicine is also acceptable.\n\nAnother method for **crucible bases (埚挺)**: Simply pound them thin and bury them—they will also lose their haze.\n\nThis is the method revered by **Mountain Master Li Jingyang (山人李景阳)**.\n\nAnother method:\nRefine **dragon liver (伏龙肝)**, lime (石灰), **mineral charcoal ash (矿炭灰)**, and **mulberry ash (桑灰)**. Boil until the mixture is white and free of haze.\n\nAnother method:\nUse the **residue of sweet persimmon (余甘子)** for boiling—it can effectively remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nWash the mixture with **limewater (石灰淋)** to eliminate the bitter taste of the ash.\n\nAnother method:\nSoak the mixture in water (浸), then boil (蒸) and wash (淋) repeatedly—no matter how many times, the purest result is best. Boil and wash in cycles of three to five times, then repeatedly grind and wash the sand with this ash, until it is completely free of haze.\n\nAnother method:\nIf the haze persists, boil the mixture again. Use **two *liǎng* (两) of refined cold water stone (寒水石)** to boil, as the resulting liquid will be deeply black—this indicates the haze has been removed. Test repeatedly until the mixture turns white. This method is derived from boiling **stone gall (石胆)** and **orpiment (砒黄)** together, though it is unclear whether other medicines can be similarly refined.\n\nAnother method:\nMix **two *liǎng* (两) of realgar (础黄)**, **two *liǎng* (两) of cold water stone (寒水石)**, and **one *liǎng* (两) of alum (盥)**, then boil. Do not use iron utensils—this yields the best results.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **alum (盥)** for three days, washing it daily until it produces a milky residue. The haze will then be completely removed.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil **aconite (附子)** in its raw form with the residue of **red silver (红银)** and **refined mercury (汞了)**. After three boilings, the haze will be eliminated.\n\nAnother method:\nUse **horse teeth juice (马齿汁)** to extract a concentrated decoction (煎取浓), then mix with **alum (消石)**, **pumice (朴消)**, and **sweet persimmon juice (甘子汁)**. Stir while heating the **red silver (红银)**. After three applications, the haze will be removed.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **hogweed root (章陆根)** with ginger (姜), then boil or wash to remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand in **limewater (石灰清)** extracted from **silkworm cocoon ash (蚕砂汁)**—this will eliminate haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand in **sesame oil (荏子油)** ten times to remove haze. Some say this method can specifically eliminate **iron haze (铁晕)**.\n\nAnother method:\nMix **refined red silver (红银)** with **refined mercury (汞了)** and boil with **raw aconite (生附子)**—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nCollect **urine from wine shop patrons (酒家酒客小便)** in a pool, then use it for boiling substances—this will remove haze. Some say the urine of **elderly men (老人尿)** is even more effective due to its prolonged storage.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand in a **sand basin (砂盆)** with **orpiment (砒黄)** and add **alum (盥)**. Do this for seven days or two cycles of seven days—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nMix **refined red silver (红银)** with **refined mercury (汞了)** and boil with **fennel (茴草)**—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil sand with **white plum (白梅)** to remove haze. Some say white plum is slightly more effective than **black plum (乌梅)**, and both should be used without their pits.\n\nAnother method:\nGrind **yellow sprouts (黄芽)** and boil for seven days in a **sand basin (砂盆)**—this will remove haze.\n\nAnother method:\nBoil with **bat guano (伏翼粪)**—this will remove haze.",

After seven days, the haze will be gone. You must rinse and grind it six or seven times daily, always using warm juice for washing. After washing, let it settle.\n\nAnother method:\nPound **calcite (理石)** and **realgar (玄精)** equally into powder, then dissolve sand to make a solution and add it—this will remove haze. It is also effective for **Dan Yang haze (丹阳晕)**.\n\nAnother method:\nDissolve **refined red silver (红银)** thinly, or before it becomes granular, into **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)** juice—this will remove haze. Some say: boil **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)** to obtain **congealed ash (霜伏)**.\n\nAnother method:\nOnce sand has been ground into a paste like **silver ointment (银膏)**—mix it with **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)**, grind into powder, then boil with **ash of *meng* plant (梦灰)** for half a day or more—it will be ready. Dry and crush it immediately; if there is a delay, stop the process. This ash is very effective at binding sand.\n\nAnother method:\nGenerally, mixing and grinding ash thoroughly is most effective against haze.\n\n**Master Kong’s (孔氏)** method for removing haze from sand and **refined red silver (红银)**:\nTake sand that has been thoroughly refined, two *jin* (斤). First, use warm **salt brine (盐浆)** water in a bowl, and grind and wash the sand with a **willowwood pestle (柳木槌)**, repeatedly submerging and rinsing the medicine. Wash it twenty times until it becomes white and pure.\n\nThen, break it up and place it in a **porcelain vessel (瓷器)**, and boil it in **glutinous rice (糯米)** brine. Add **two *sheng* (升) of *wu mei* (乌梅)** without pits. If you use **strong wine brine (酒家醇浆)** from an inn, it is also acceptable.\n\nBoil for two days, without adding any other medicines. Every day, wash and grind it four times, always using warm brine for the process. Do not use **cold water (玲水)** at any stage, before or after.\n\nWhen washing and grinding, add a small amount of **Barbary wolfberry (胡同律)**—one *qian* (钱) divided into four doses as a guideline. This **Barbary wolfberry (胡同律)** is suitable for both copper and iron, and very effective at removing haze.\n\nIf using **aged earthen wall soil (远年土壁土)** as a broth, it is also excellent.\n\nFor cases where **lime (石灰)** is used sparingly, place water in a bowl, and grind and wash the sand with a **willowwood pestle (柳木槌)**, repeatedly submerging and rinsing the medicine. Wash it twenty times.\n\nPut **brine (浆水)**—about half a bowl—into a **porcelain vessel (瓷器)** and immerse the sand. For every *jin* (斤) of sand, use **one *fen* (分) of *li* sand (硵砂)** in the brine. Place it in a warm spot, and after one *fu* (伏) time, the medicine will naturally appear.\n\nStir it with a **rake (篦)**, then wash and grind it with water, kneading by hand until it settles.\n\nThen, take a **large iron mortar (大铁臼)**, mix sand and **salt (盐)**—two *sheng* (升)—and grind with a strong man until it resembles **green mud (青泥)**. Every day, wash and grind it three times, mix with **alum (盥)**, and cast into a mold. Rinse with **urine ash (小便来灰)** juice and boil for one day.\n\nAgain, mix with **alum (盥)** and grind for one day, also three times daily. Change the **alum (盥)**, and boil again with **urine ash (小便灰)** juice for one day—this will be fully effective.\n\nIf you do not boil it again with **alum (盥)**, calculate three days of boiling, and it will be fully free of haze. Some say that after this process, **mercury (汞)** will also be easier to control.\n\nIf haze remains, boil the sand in **vinegar brine (醋浆)**. Add **two *liang* (两) of white alum (白矾)**, **two *liang* (两) of salt (盐)**, **two *sheng* (升) of *wu mei* (乌梅)**, and **two *liang* (两) of alum (寒水石)**—rinse thoroughly. You may also use **half *liang* (两) of orpiment (砒霜)**.\n\nFor **one *qian* (钱) of *li* sand (硵砂)**, use **two *liang* (两) of magnolia bark (朴消)** and **one tea bowl of finely ground white willow root (白章柳根)**. Boil for two days, rinsing the sand three times daily. Follow the previous method of grinding with **Barbary wolfberry (胡同律)** and using **aged earthen wall soil (壁土)** as a broth—this will remove all haze.\n\nIf haze persists, take sand and boil it with **two *liang* (两) each of *fu long* liver (伏龙肝)** and **white lead (白善)**, **one *fen* (分) of lime (石灰矿)**, and **two *liang* (两) of *meng* plant ash (梦灰)** and **urine ash (来灰)** for two days. Then, follow the previous method of washing and grinding—this will make the sand white and free of haze.\n\nIf haze still remains, for every *jin* (斤) of sand, add **one *liang* (两) of yellow cinnabar (黄丹)**. In a **porcelain vessel (瓷器)**, roast it over low heat until the sand is fully incorporated, then grind it. Add **one *jin* (斤) of sugar sand (砂糖)**, a small amount of water, and boil for one day—no rinsing needed. **Sugar sand (沙糖)** can remove **black haze (黑晕)**.\n\nIf you use **concentrated rice vinegar (浓米醋)**, or if you do not have **vinegar without dregs (无糠醋)**, add **soap pods (皂荚)** instead.

      "translated_text": "A Method:\n\nAfter cooking, take the sand and form it into small pellets. Place wind-dissolved lime into the iron mortar, scatter the sand over it, and insert the pellets into the lime. Secure tightly and subject to fire-nurturing for one month.\n\nLater, pound it—it will be free of haze. For every *jin* of sand, yield fifteen *liang* or more. Dry the sand thoroughly.\n\nThe sand before and after must never be exposed to cold water. For every *jin* of sand, mix with one *liang* of *fúshuāng* (伏霜), grinding until fully incorporated. If *fúshuāng* is unavailable, raw *shuāng* (霜) may be used instead.\n\nDivide into sixteen pill-sized balls, coating them with salt. First, refine the salt finely, then wrap each ball in clay, sealing them individually. Pierce each ball with a pin, creating three to five small holes, and dry them. Place them in a crucible—an iron pan (*tǎng* 铛) may also be used. Cover with fine yellow earth or lime. Alternatively, spread charcoal ash on top, seal tightly, and nurture with gentle fire for one day. Gradually increase to strong fire until the crucible’s base glows red. Once cooled, open it and collect the vaporized mercury.\n\nIf mercury remains on the ash, collect it entirely. Leave the pan undisturbed, placing it horizontally over charcoal fire, and burn through with strong flame until fully red. Once cooled, break the balls, recover the sand, and mix with *wūméi* (乌梅), *bái fán* (白矾), and salt. Boil for half a day until dry. Add *níqiú yán* (泥球盐) and fire once more, then introduce the medicine and boil again for half a day. If further mercury is added and ground to blend, place it back in the crucible and vaporize three to five times. The mercury will ascend, drawing out the haze.\n\nThen, place it in a small crucible, covering with cow dung ash and a touch of salt. Nurture with slow fire. [Unclear text]—whether the juice’s potency is deep or shallow—pound as if already known.\n\nWhen initially pounding, add the mother substance (*mǔ* 母) simultaneously—this is excellent, surpassing adding it in the second round.\n\nSand that has undergone repeated leaching and grinding is light and porous, easily dispersed by wind. Great care must be taken to prevent loss. The method of strong-fire burning in the pan is superior—it ensures the substance is fully refined and retains its medicinal power. Placing it in the crucible also prevents dispersion and avoids fragmentation.\n\nFor the pill balls, some say to use Persian white alum (*bó sī bái fán* 波斯白矾) and *hú tóng lǜ* (胡同律), which is also excellent.\n\nOnce the substance is refined into a liquid and dried, it is better to immerse it in a *huá chí* (华池, \"flower pool\"). The pool method uses water and wine, dissolving *pú xiāo* (朴消) and *bái fán* (白矾), with no grease present.\n\nAnother method: mix salt and water to form a pool, making it slightly concentrated and soft.

      "translated_text": "If the method is not yet complete, then return it to the crucible for refining.\nFor every *cāng* (斤) of substance, use no more than two *liǎng* (两) of the refined powder, following the *Dān Yáng* method to extract the essence and form *dàn* (砣).\n\nThen wrap the *dàn* in a clay ball for one day, then subject it to thirty *diǎn* (点) treatments, and wrap it again in a clay ball.\nNext, return it to the crucible for refining, adding two *liǎng* of the mother substance for every ten *liǎng* of the refined material. The mother substance must be of the finest quality—preferably from the original mountain or marsh—and must be tested personally, free of any impurities. This is a critical step.\n\nStir thoroughly within the crucible, then pour it into the pool to form a thin *dàn*.\nBefore refining, ensure that *huáng dān* (黄丹) is present in the mixture. When placing it in the crucible, be especially mindful that all lead is fully expelled. If not, this is a flaw.\n\nThen subject it to thirty more *diǎn* treatments, wrap it in a clay ball for another day, and return it to the crucible for refining.\nFor every ten *liǎng* of the substance, add another two *liǎng* of the mother substance, stir thoroughly, and pour it back into the pool to form a *dàn*. The result should be smooth, white, and free of haze.\n\nIf it is still not fully refined, add another six *liǎng* of the mother substance, making a total of twenty *liǎng* (this is the \"paired addition\"). Refine it again in the crucible, stirring well, then add *bìtǔ* (壁土), *bái fán* (白矾), and *kuángshā* (硇砂) to purify the surface, ensuring clarity. Pour it into the pool to form a thin *dàn*.\n\nHeat it in the fire until it glows a deep red, then remove it and let it cool to a bright luster.\nRepeat the heating process three or four times, then wash it thoroughly with a cloth to ensure purity.\nPlace it in a bottle and boil for a full cycle, then remove it. Repeat the heating and boiling process—each cycle of boiling counts as one refining in the crucible.\n\nDo this seven times until no haze remains.\nIf the substance is still not fully refined, proceed to the subsequent methods to achieve the true treasure.\n\n---\n**On the Method of *Hóng Yín* (红银):**\nThe *Jīn Líng Zǐ* (金陵子) says: Upon reading the *Dān Jīng* (丹经), he suddenly understood this principle.\nThe *hóng yín* (red silver) should be refined according to the *Dān Yáng* method until no haze remains.\nIf this is not possible, take the *hóng yín* that has already been refined to a red-silver hue and grind it into a powder, then mix it with *gǒng* (汞). Use a small amount of *gǒng*—too much will cause haze and make it difficult to refine.\n\nAfter thoroughly washing and refining, add more *gǒng* and mix it with lead, stirring well before placing it in the furnace. Secure it with flat cloth and let it sublimate.\nThe furnace should be lined with yellow soil and paper fibers, then covered with dry yellow soil, five *cùn* (寸) thick, with an additional one *cùn* layer on top.\n\nOn the first day, use gentle fire to nurture it without allowing the *gǒng* to rise.\nOn the second day, gradually increase the heat, and on the third day, apply strong fire to drive the *gǒng* upward.\nOpen the furnace when it cools, collect the *gǒng* from the upper vessel, and retrieve the lead from the furnace, then immerse it in the pool to achieve whiteness.\nDo not add any *fán* (矾) or other substances to the furnace, as this may cause the *gǒng* to crystallize into frost and weaken the lead’s potency.\nIf the lead still shows impurities, break it down again—it will eventually succeed.\n\nAnother method states that the amount of *hóng yín* sand is not limited; simply refine it thoroughly and mix it with lead. Even if it is not fully refined, it will still yield results.\nAdd one *liǎng* of [missing term] and grind it together before refining—this will prevent haze.\n\nAnother method involves sifting the refined substance through fine silk and mixing it with water until it forms a moist, granular mass. Place a small amount of *xiǎn* (盥) in the mixture, then refine the lead and other substances using the standard method.\n\n---\n**Method for *Suì Zǐ* (遂子) from *Hóng Yín*:**\nTake one *jīn* (斤) of thoroughly refined *hóng yín* (red silver), mix it with four *liǎng* of the mother substance, making a total of twenty *liǎng*. Form a thin *dàn* in a crucible—if it is too thick, pound it until even.\n\nAfter pounding, heat it until it matches the fire’s hue, then boil and wash it clean. Use three *jīn* of *gǒng* (汞), place the *dàn* flat in the *gāng* (铛), and secure it tightly. Apply gentle fire, like that of a midsummer day, then gradually increase the heat.\n\nOpen the furnace every two days. If *gǒng* rises, slightly reduce the fire—only enough to prevent it from rising further.\nAfter twenty days, recast it into a *dàn*. Repeat this process for another twenty days, then recast again.\nAfter refining and nurturing for six [missing term], all haze will disappear, and it will become the true treasure.\n(Note: One version states \"six *liǎng* folded into two.\")\n\nWhen first refining, add a small amount of *kuángshā* (硇砂) and *dǎnzǐ* (胆子), then boil the *gǒng* for a day. The *dàn* should adhere to the bottom of the *gāng*, fully integrating with the *gǒng*—this is ideal.\n\nAnother method states: Take four *liǎng* of the *dàn*, mix one *liǎng* of *Běi Tíng kuángshā* (北庭硇砂), one *liǎng* of *shí dǎn* (石胆), and one *fēn* (分) of *jié lín yì* (骇鳞蜴). Grind these three substances together, then mix with rice vinegar into a paste and coat the *dàn*. Wrap it in yellow soil, one *cùn* and two *fēn* thick, and bake it in husk-fire for three days. Then burn it with white charcoal for three more days.\nRemove the soil and place it in the original vessel with four *liǎng* of *gǒng*. (From the *Dān Shā Jīng* (丹砂经).)\n\nAnother version says: Before refining, line the vessel with *huáng dān* (黄丹) and *hú fěn* (胡粉) to form a paste. Place the *gǒng* and *dàn* inside, and after one refining cycle of ten days, there will be no haze—whether the quantity is large or small, it is at the user’s discretion, with ten *liǎng* as the standard.\n\nAnother version states: For *suì zǐ*, mix with *xiāoshí* (消石) and refine it for seven days, alternating between upright and inverted positions each day. After seven days, it will turn into black ash. Grind and wash it thoroughly, then refine it until it becomes white and fluffy.\n\n---\n**The Dao of *Suì Zǐ*:**\nThe essence of *suì zǐ* lies in its minimal haze—this makes oral ingestion easier. If the process seems difficult, this is the key insight.\nTake one *jīn* of thoroughly refined *hóng yín* (red silver), mix it with four *liǎng* of the mother substance, making a total of twenty *liǎng*. Form a thin *dàn* in a crucible—if it is too thick, pound it until even.\n\nAfter pounding, heat it until it matches the fire’s hue, then boil and wash it clean. Use three *jīn* of *gǒng* (汞), place the *dàn* in the *gāng* (铛), and add a small amount of *shí dǎn* (石胆) and *kuángshā* (硇砂) water. Boil for a day—the *gǒng* and *dàn* should fully integrate, with the *dàn* adhering to the bottom of the *gāng*. Then seal it tightly and let the *yīn* (阴) energy emerge.",

The pool method uses water and wine, dissolving *pú xiāo* (朴消) and *bái fán* (白矾), with no grease present.\n\nAnother method: mix salt and water to form a pool, making it slightly concentrated and soft. Alternatively, use *zào jiá* (皂荚) for the pool, which should be thick and potent. The resulting substance will be soft, white, and free of haze.\n\nAnother method...",
