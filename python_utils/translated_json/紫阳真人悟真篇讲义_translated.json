Those with discernment say that since the *Triple Concordance*, no work has matched this one.\n\nThough I have dabbled in such studies during my leisure, I have yet to grasp its subtleties. Xia Zongyu of Yunfeng, having traveled from Yongjia to wander among the curtains of Manting, presented me with his *Lecture Notes on the *Awakening to Reality***. Through meticulous chapter divisions and line-by-line analysis, reading it dispels all doubts with clarity.\n\nYet, as I have just secluded myself and declined visitors, I cannot follow him to inquire at length and exhaust its wonders. Still, judging by his character—his talent and intelligence forthright and towering—he has served in the military headquarters of Shandong, carrying official dispatches through Yan and Qi, his ambitions for merit and fame keen indeed.\n\nAt not yet fifty years of age, you now contemplate casting aside official cap and carriage to wander the vast seas and mountains with Anqi and Xianmen—this is a plan far too premature. I have lately heard Daoist teachings that attaining immortality is most difficult, save for those of utmost loyalty and filial piety, who may achieve it without cultivation. Though such claims seem remote and elusive, beyond easy comprehension, if celestial immortals truly exist, they must surely be those who were loyal ministers and filial sons—such attainment cannot be left to chance. With your talents, even if you do not seek to serve the world, the world will not leave you idle. Strive to establish merit in this enlightened age, repay the state and honor your family, fulfilling both loyalty and filial piety. Only then may you follow your remote ancestor, Xia Huanggong, to roam the orchards of Mount Shang—nothing will be beyond you.\n\nYou have also authored *Lecture Notes on the Yinfu Jing* and other works, which remain at Maogang Tower. Cishu has already written a preface for them, so I shall say no more.\n\nWritten on the third day after the Winter Solstice in the third year of the Baoqing era by Zhen Dexiu of Jian’an.\n\nAmong the many scholars of my homeland renowned for classical learning and literary ambition, none has yet been able to transmit the oral instructions of Zhang Pingshu’s *Awakening to Reality*. Yet Master Xia Zongyu alone, through secret transmission and seated instruction, has advanced in this Way—this is indeed extraordinary. From youth, he harbored lofty aspirations, believing merit and fame could be attained with ease. Over the past twenty years, he has studied under Masters Ying, Jia, and Xu, and shared hardships with Gou Mengyu in the military headquarters, traversing Qing and Qi, crossing the Taihang Mountains, and venturing deep into Tartar territory, enduring extreme toil and exhaustion. Later, his circumstances diverged from his wishes, and he withdrew from worldly affairs, ceasing even to speak of them. He composed three works—*The Mirror of Medicines*, *Lecture Notes on the Yinfu Jing*, and *Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality*—to which Daoist adepts have even sworn oaths to become his disciples.\n\nI have long admired those of ancient times who, having achieved merit and renown, retired like Fan Li to the Five Lakes or roamed with Master Red Pine, yet left not a single word behind. Might you now be burdened by your own writings? He replied: “I am no one who seeks to soar high and withdraw far. My aspirations will only be fulfilled when all people of later ages can reverse aging and return to youth, transcending the ordinary to enter the wondrous. Why should I惜 words?” This discourse is especially profound—worthy of reverence and admiration.\n\nWritten in the early spring of the first year of the Shaoding era by Cao Shuyuan, Minor Supervisor of the Secretariat, of Yongjia.\n\nHow can the Way be anything but rooted in one’s own body? The elixir of longevity and immortality—who could find it outside oneself? Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui—these are the elements of my body. Metal and Wood, Water and Fire—these are the elements of my body. Interlocking pears and fiery jujubes—these are the essences of my body. Nectar and jade liquor—these are the vital fluids of my body. Though a thousand forms and ten thousand shapes arise, none lie beyond this body. Yet ordinary people, though they know methods to preserve and protect it, cannot master its transformations. Only the perfected possess the art of inversion and reversal. Thus, they guard the true and embrace the One: the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger is born in water. Without inversion and reversal, how can the Way be accomplished? The seven returns and nine reversions—these are the wondrous grades. The eight reunions and six residences—these are the divine grades. Zhang Pingshu knew this; Xia Zongyu knows this; the Old Man of Shouzhang gazes in awe and sighs.\n\nWritten on an auspicious day in the first month of winter in the first year of the Shaoding era by Zhang Mizi, Gentleman of the Secretariat, of Siming.\n\n**Daoist Canon, Jade Instructions Section**\n*Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality by the Perfected of Purple Yang*\n\n**Title:** *Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality by the Perfected of Purple Yang*\nSeven juan, compiled by Xia Yuanding of the Southern Song.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Jade Instructions Section\n\n**Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality by the Perfected of Purple Yang, Volume One**\nBy Xia Zongyu, the Cloud Peak Recluse of Yongjia.\n\nSixteen quatrains in heptasyllabic verse,\nTheir number mirroring the sixteen ounces of a catty.\n\nWho seeks not the Great Dao strays from the path,\nThough burdened with talent, how can one be a true man?\nA hundred years of life flicker like sparks from stone,\nA lifetime’s existence floats like bubbles on water.\nOnly craving rank and wealth for glory and fame,\nHeedless of one’s form withering unseen.\nTry asking if gold piled high as mountains\nCan buy back what impermanence denies.\n\n*The Assembly of Perfected on Western Mountain* states:\n\"Fame and profit must be sought, yet each has its destined measure—\nThose who see through this are free from entanglement.\nAffection and love must be cultivated, yet their karma is self-wrought—\nThose who see through this are free from attachment.\nMoreover, a human life spans a hundred years, yet seventy is rare.\nLike dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows—nothing is fixed or sure.\nThe deluded know only rank, wealth, and glory,\nPiling gold and jade, believing in eternal enjoyment.\nYet unaware that form withers unseen,\nAnd impermanence cannot be bought—\nIn the sudden moment like morning dew,\nWhat use are rank, gold, or jade to me?\n\nOnly the Great Dao is constant,\nTranscending the realm of things,\nNeither born nor destroyed,\nNeither coming nor going.\nWhile in the world, it regards all things without attachment.\nWhen weary of the world, it abides in the Dao to nurture the spirit.\nWealth cannot defile,\nGold and jade cannot taint,\nTime cannot age,\nImpermanence cannot approach—\nIs this not the true man?\n\nOtherwise, why would the ancient sages say,\n‘Immortality can be learned,\nDeathlessness can be attained through effort’?\n\nThough a human life may span a hundred years,\nLongevity or early death, poverty or success—none can be foreknown.\nYesterday, one rode through the streets on horseback;\nToday, one lies in a coffin as a sleeping corpse.\nWife and wealth, abandoned, are no longer yours,\nWhile karmic deeds follow—who can deceive themselves?\nIf the Great Elixir is not sought, how can one encounter it?\nAnd if encountered yet not refined, how foolish is that?\n\nLife and death, day and night—such is the natural order.\nYet if one holds to the Dao, though dead, one yet lives—\nHow much more so for the immortals, who attain deathless life?\nThus, ‘Hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die by evening.’\nThis does not mean that hearing the Dao hastens death,\nBut that even in death, one yet lives.\n‘Corpse-liberation and ascension’ describe their transformations—\nFor immortals can exit death and enter life.\n\nThe deluded, unaware, chase after the fields of desire,\nUncertain of the morrow, abandoning wife and wealth,\nWith karmic deeds clinging to them—\nPingshu deeply pities them.\nIf one but knows this, one must seek the Great Elixir to avoid such an end.\nYet this elixir is not sought externally—\nIt is said that everyone possesses the elixir of long life,\nBut without a teacher to point it out, it remains hidden.\nEven if one meets a teacher yet fails to cultivate,\nThe spark-like span of life swiftly passes through birth, aging, sickness, and death—\nHow foolish is that?\n\nThis method is true within the true, wondrous within the wondrous,\nAll because I alone differ from others.\nI know the inversion arises from *li* and *kan*,\nBut who recognizes the floating and sinking to determine host and guest?\nThe golden crucible seeks to retain cinnabar-clad mercury,\nThe jade pool first receives silver from the water.\nThe divine work of firing is not a full day’s labor—\nA single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool.\n\nThe poems of *Awakening to Reality* serve as the Supreme Lord’s proclamation of the secret principles of the Golden Elixir.\nYet the first two chapters merely exhort the world—\nIn truth, this chapter marks the beginning of profound discourse.\nHow many commentators have sought to explain it,\nYet none have fully elucidated its depths.\nHow then to guide later learners?\nThere is no other way:\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a true teacher, do not force guesses.\n\nThe wonder within the true, the true within the wonder—\nScholars take these as mere metaphors for the Great Dao,\nUnaware that the profound mysteries of the Golden Elixir\nPrecisely distinguish the true from the ordinary.\nThose who attain the true harmonize their virtue with heaven and earth.\nThose who master the wondrous remain unknown even to ghosts and spirits.\nBut if one falls into the ordinary,\nOne strays from the Dao and harms life.\n\n*Master Yunfang* said:\n\"A trifling celestial mechanism speaks of *qi* and essence—\nBeyond this true, there is no true.\"\n*The Mirror of Medicines* said:\n\"Following conditions, one attains the utmost true,\nWhich can manifest and transform, penetrating the divine.\"\n\nThus, Pingshu earnestly instructs on the distinction between true and ordinary.\nHe says, \"If you do not recognize the true lead as the primal ancestor,\"\nAnd, \"Diligently seek the true lead.\"\nHe says, \"If you wish to retain mercury with true lead,\"\nAnd, \"Within, there is the natural true fire.\"\nAs for \"using lead yet not using ordinary lead,\nAnd having used true lead, discarding it\"—\nAll this is to make one distinguish the difference between true and ordinary,\nFor this is the foundation of understanding the Dao,\nThe gateway to refining the Golden Elixir—\nHow can one neglect it without reflection?\n\nMoreover, *li* (☲) is the south, noon—yang, fire.\n*Kan* (☵) is the north, midnight—yin, water.\nYang fire flames upward, yin water moistens downward,\nAbove and below, as if deaf and uncommunicative, never uniting.\nYet within *li*, one line is even—an image of outer yang and inner yin.\nThus, yin carries yang and tends downward,\nYin descends, and yang descends with it.\nWithin *kan*, one line is odd—an image of outer yin and inner yang.\nThus, yang carries yin and rushes upward,\nYang ascends, and yin ascends with it.\nThough this describes the ascent and descent of yin and yang,\nIt is not the method of inverting *kan* and *li*.\nThe world clings to this,\nOften taking the heart as *li* and the kidneys as *kan*,\nMaking heart and kidneys unite,\nWater and fire harmonize,\nAnd clinging to this as the work of the Golden Elixir—\nThis is not so. It is merely the method of peace and joy.\n\nFor the heart and kidneys have form and substance,\nWaxing and waning—\nHow can they be the Dao?\nOnly the immortals can empty *kan* and fill *li*,\nEmploying the method of inversion.\n\nWhy?\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate divided,\nThere was a thing, undifferentiated—\nWhat was *li*, what was *kan*?\nFrom \"Heaven generates one, water,\"\n\"Earth generates two, fire\"—\nOnly after water and fire separated were *kan* and *li* delineated.\nThus, two yin embrace one yang to form *kan* (☵).\n*Kan* is full, its outer image water,\nYet within it, yang fire is born.\nThe immortals must refine this yang to empty its center,\nRaising its fire for the work of the Golden Elixir.\n\nTwo yang embrace one yin to form *li* (☲). *Li* is hollow at its center, its outer image fire, yet within it, yin water is born. The immortals must refine this yin to fill its center, uniting its lines to form a body of pure yang. Thus, when *kan* is emptied, it becomes *kun* (☷); when *li* is filled, it becomes *qian* (☰). This is the transformation of the Qian Dao, each rectifying its nature and destiny—taking the fullness from the *kan* position in the heart and infusing it into the yin within the *li* palace of the abdomen. As for the heart and kidneys uniting, water and fire harmonizing—what does this have to do with the matter?\n\nAs for the theories of floating and sinking, guest and host, they are no mere allegories. Within the human body, there is a thing: one floats, one sinks; one is guest, one is host. The qi and vessels communicate subtly without interruption. Should the sinking one suffer loss, the floating one also suffers. If the host is deficient, the guest is likewise deficient. Thus, to retain cinnabar mercury in the golden crucible, one must first deposit liquid mercury in the jade pool—then the root flourishes and the branches thrive, the source runs deep and the flow endures.\n\nYet mercury and lead cannot transform themselves; they must rely on the fire of divine skill, drawn and added in operation, before the mysterious pearl takes form and the radiant red elixir is completed. This is achieved in less than a morning, and the Dao-fruit is perfected.\n\nMaster Haichan said: *\"Sink to the ocean’s depths, and embrace the rising sun.\"* Is this not the manifestation of the solar wheel in the deep pool?\n\nAttaining the Dao in this way, I truly differ from others. This chapter reveals the marrow of the Golden Elixir and discloses the celestial mechanism. If scholars can grasp the meaning through the text, then the Dao is present before their eyes—no need for the three thousand six hundred gates.\n\nTiger leaps, dragon soars—waves surge rough,\nAt the central true position, the luminous pearl is born.\nThough fruit on branches may ripen in time,\nHow is the child in the womb different?\n\nNorth and South sects invert the hexagrams’ images,\nMorning and evening fire-timing aligns with the celestial pivot.\nKnow that great reclusion dwells in the marketplace—\nDo not seek solitude in the deep mountains.\n\nThe dragon is a yang thing; the tiger, a yin thing. Their union, symbolized by dragon and tiger, yields the mysterious pearl in a moment’s work at the true position. The true position is the place where the yellow center penetrates principle. It is like fruit growing on branches or a child in the womb—when the qi-cycles of the celestial circuit are complete, it naturally matures. The North and South sects’ inversion of hexagrams is precisely the earlier principle of inverting *kan* and *li*. Dao Guang said: *\"Face south to observe the Northern Dipper, and within stillness gather true lead.\"* Morning and evening fire-timing aligns with the celestial pivot, as in *\"morning Layering, evening Ignorance\"*—harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, all following natural timing, not confined to sitting in vigil on *gengshen* nights or exhaling and inhaling at *zi* and *wu* hours.\n\nThose who attain this Dao are neither noble nor base, neither in the marketplace nor the mountains. If a determined scholar can cultivate this, there is no harm in dwelling in the city or serving at court.\n\nTrue Man Wang Ding said: *\"Kan-tiger, Li-dragon, tortoise essence, phoenix marrow—knowing you have awakened to the elixir’s origin, the wind-lamp is hard to preserve. Best to advance in cultivation now. It does not lie in visualizing heart and kidneys, nor in sitting alone in the cliffs. Do you understand, sir? The medicine is before your eyes, rising and sinking from dawn to dusk. If you can grasp even a little of the yang essence, the subtlety requires no further seeking.\"*\n\nMay the winding river be clear and still, the divine water flow westward. Let metal and wood not be obstructed, and may the yang hun and yin po unite. Within the primordial chaos, a radiant red sun shines—gather it in the crucible.\n\nYellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find,\nBut the distant seeker must rely on deep virtue.\nThe Four Symbols and Five Phases depend entirely on earth;\nThe Three Primes and Eight Trigrams how could they leave *ren*?\n\nRefining the numinous essence, it becomes hard to recognize;\nDissolving all yin demons, ghosts cannot invade.\nWishing to leave this secret formula among humankind,\nYet not a single soul is found to be a knowing friend.\n\nThe Yellow Sprout and White Snow are the supreme nine-grade elixir of the ancient sages, refined from the essence of the Primordial Lord’s Wood through the crucible of water and fire. With no regard for years or months, through prolonged refinement and nurturing, its radiant essence naturally coalesces into auspiciousness, transcending the vulgar qualities of cinnabar and mercury. This may be called \"from nonbeing into being, from the mortal into the sacred.\" Ingesting it transforms one’s form and renews the bones, allowing ascent to the heavens—how could the world recognize such a treasure?\n\nWithin the inner elixir of the human body, these two treasures also exist. Yet those of shallow virtue and meager merit, who feel shame in their every movement, can scarcely attain them. Thus, Master Pingshu exhorted those who seek the Dao to cultivate yin merits and yang virtues, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, while also pointing to the path where these treasures are not hard to find: the Four Symbols and Five Phases all depend on Earth, and the Three Primes and Eight Trigrams cannot depart from *ren*. Is this not because Earth gives birth to the Yellow Sprout and *ren* gives birth to White Snow?\n\nEarth resides at the center, its color yellow. Without Earth, the Wood of the Azure Dragon, the Metal of the White Tiger, the Fire of the Vermilion Bird, and the Water of the Dark Warrior cannot fulfill their transformations. Thus, Earth is the master of the Five Phases, nurturing all things. As Immortal Lü said: \"When thunder shakes and rain falls upon the mountain’s peak, it gradually waters the Yellow Sprout as it emerges from the soil.\" *Ren* occupies the position of Water, generated by Metal, its color white and its qi cold. Whether the Three Primes of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, or the Eight Trigrams of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*, none can depart from the Water of *ren*. Water is the mother of the Golden Elixir, and *ren* is the inception of the child—this is the moment when the first yang stirs to form the elixir. An ancient song says: \"To cultivate the Dao, seek the mystery in the Water Palace; when the empty chamber generates whiteness, White Snow arises naturally from *ren*.\"\n\nThose who refine this numinous treasure dissolve all yin demons, and though it is not passed even from father to son, how could the uninitiated recognize it? Profound and unfathomable, it remains inviolable even to ghosts. Yet while some hear that Earth gives birth to the Yellow Sprout and assume it refers to the spleen as central Earth, or that *ren* gives birth to White Snow and take it to mean the kidneys as the Water of *ren*, they fail to realize that the spleen and kidneys are tangible substances—just as cinnabar and mercury are tangible compounds—how could they serve as agents of transformation? The adept refining the elixir must not cling to the spleen and kidneys within, nor abandon mercury and cinnabar without. Know that the Yellow Sprout and White Snow emerge beyond form and substance, existing as \"nonbeing within being, being within nonbeing,\" a mystery within mystery, a wonder beyond wonder—unfathomable and inconceivable.\n\nThe worldly vie for fame and profit, indulging in debauchery, wine, and lust. Even minor practices of ease and joy are neglected, so how could they seek the great Dao’s confidants or the secret formulas of the Golden Elixir? It is a sorrowful difficulty indeed. Every person possesses the medicine of immortality, yet in their folly, they cast it aside. Sweet dew descends only when Heaven and Earth unite; the Yellow Sprout grows only when *Kan* and *Li* intersect. The frog in the well leaps but a few inches in its shallow pool, the sparrow in the hedge flits low among the weeds—how could they know of the dragon’s palace beneath the vast sea or the phoenix’s nest in the towering forests? When the medicine ripens, gold naturally fills the house—why seek herbs to burn as straw?\n\nHeaven and Earth unite their essences to generate all things; man and woman unite their essences to generate humanity. In their ceaseless transformations, from root to origin, there is neither immortal nor mortal, neither noble nor base—all receive a single spark of true yang qi. Thus, the Three Powers stand together, and one may dwell in the world forever. Yet humanity, adrift in the rivers of desire and seas of lust, squanders the essence at the tailbone day and night, indulging in fleeting pleasures without restraint. How pitiful their ignorance, wasting a century’s cultivation of the true! Thus, Master Pingshu took pity on them, saying that the medicine of longevity exists within the human body—sweet dew and the Yellow Sprout are its very substance.\n\nWhen the qi of Heaven descends and the qi of Earth ascends, their harmonious vapors steam together, and sweet dew descends. *Li* receives the Earth of *wu*, *Kan* receives the Earth of *ji*; water and fire circulate and meet at the central Yellow position, and the Yellow Sprout grows. This is no external matter, yet when lesser men hear of the Dao, they surely laugh. Like the frog leaping in a ladle of water or the sparrow flitting low among the weeds, how could they know of the dragon’s palace in the deep sea or the phoenix’s nest in the towering forests? It is not worth reproaching them.\n\nOnly the man of the Dao refines this great medicine, drinking sweet dew in due season and daily gathering the Yellow Sprout. Through the regulation of fire and the addition of time, when the celestial cycles are complete, yang is restored and the bones are renewed. Divine radiance manifests, the golden countenance becomes majestic, and one unites with the Dao in truth. As the Perfected of Yin said: \"When you reach the place of the Yellow Sprout, gold fills my house.\" Why seek herbs to burn as straw to transform external crucible substances?\n\nDiligently seek true lead, lest time slip away too easily.\nCapture the Earth’s *po* to subdue vermilion mercury,\nAnd you will see the Heaven’s *hun* restrain Water-Metal.\nThis may be called: \"The Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;\nVirtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere it.\"\nOnce you know longevity equals Heaven and Earth,\nNo vexations will ever trouble the heart again.\n\nThe great Dao of the Golden Elixir arises from nothing more than lead and mercury, yet no one in the world understands this—why? The Most High said: \"Take lead as the lord, mercury as the minister.\" If lead is not true, mercury will not draw near. An ancient song says: \"Only fear that lead is not true; if lead is true, the medicine forms itself.\" The world often takes lead to be the single spark of yang essence in the northern true qi, yet they do not realize that within it, there is both the true and the vulgar. The true harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth; the vulgar shares its conduct with swine and dogs. Moreover, though lead and mercury are distinct, their root is one. Lead gives birth to mercury, and mercury in turn gives birth to lead—this is the sevenfold reversal of the returning elixir.\n\nWithout diligent inquiry, seeking teachers and visiting friends, and obtaining the golden needle to scrape away the film, one will indeed fritter away life in the fleeting spark of a flint, trapped in birth, aging, sickness, and death. If one knows this, then by mutually restraining the Heaven’s *hun*, Earth’s *po*, golden lead, and fiery mercury, the cultivation of virtue and power becomes possible.\n\nFor the *hun* of Heaven is yang, the sun, fire, and mercury; the *po* of Earth is yin, the moon, water, and lead—all are merely alternate names for lead and mercury.\n\nYet when Earth’s *po* seizes and restrains fiery mercury, this is yin’s power to control yang. When Heaven’s *hun* subdues watery lead, this is yang’s power to master yin. The alternation of one yin and one yang—this is the Dao; the union of sun and moon—this is the elixir. Then how could the Dao fail to ascend, how could virtue fail to deepen? Though the hidden and the manifest differ in kind, one may yet subdue dragon and tiger, command ghosts and spirits. Thus may one’s lifespan equal Heaven and Earth, transcend the realm of things—what care then for the vexations of the dusty world?\n\nCease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; to seek among the myriad herbs is even further from the truth. When yin and yang find their kindred and return to mutual resonance, when the two eights stand in perfect balance, they naturally unite in affinity. At the depths of the cauldron, the sun glows crimson and yin’s monstrosities vanish; atop the mountain, the moon shines white and the medicinal sprouts renew.\n\nThe Three Yellows are orpiment, realgar, and sulphur; together with mercury and cinnabar, they form the Four Spirits. The \"myriad herbs\" are the drugs of external alchemy. Yet the worldly cannot guard the true and embrace the One, but instead seek outside themselves, inwardly exhausting essence and qi, outwardly ingesting numinous elixirs—this is like ladling boiling water to stop the boil, or carrying firewood to quench the fire: none have ever lived thereby. Not that the elixir lacks efficacy, but that taking it brings no benefit. As Pingshu said: \"Without the true seed within, one but boils an empty cauldron with water and fire.\"\n\nMoreover, the Three Yellows and Four Spirits are what the perfected immortals of the inner elixir employ only after their cultivation is complete, after accumulating merit and virtue, when they weary of the dusty world and wish to dissolve their bonds. Yet how can they abandon the body bequeathed by their parents? For though its essence and blood are foul and putrid, it was born as something wondrous. They must rely on the external elixir to transmute it, to change bones and alter form, to replenish the yang spirit, before they can ride the void and step upon the qi, mount the crane and soar upon the clouds.\n\nNow the common herd, entangled in sensual pleasures, with abundant resources refine the medicine, with depleted vitality seek aid—can this be called \"yin and yang finding their kindred\"? Can this be called \"the two eights standing in balance\"? Only when the inner elixir is achieved does one ingest the external elixir: with one’s own pure yang body, one relies upon that pure yang medicine—this is finding kindred. It is like weighing one’s own half-catty against another’s eight ounces—this is standing in balance. Only then does the sun at the bottom of the pool blaze crimson with radiant light, the moon atop the mountain appear faintly manifest. This is the alternation of floating and sinking, the qi’s channels in mutual resonance. What is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen. Those of this age who would grasp this principle must seek true lead and true mercury, not common cinnabar or quicksilver.\n\n*Commentary on the* Awakening to Reality *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the First, Concluded*\n*Commentary on the* Awakening to Reality *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the Second*\n\nThe Cloud-Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia wrote:\n\nNot knowing the inversion within the mystery,\nHow can one plant lotus in fire?\nLeading the White Tiger home to nurture,\nIt yields a luminous pearl round as the moon.\n\nIdly tending the elixir furnace, watching the fire’s timing—\nSimply still the spirit and thought, let nature take its course.\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the elixir ripens,\nLeaping beyond the mortal dragon to live ten thousand years.\n\nThe discourse on the wondrous inversion has been detailed before.\n\"Planting lotus in fire,\" though Master Lü [Dongbin] used external matters as metaphor, is in truth the work of internal elixir refinement. Without a teacher’s transmission, scholars vainly labor over annotations. Yet the lotus grows in water, fire arises from wood—how can a water-born thing be planted in fire? This is no principle at all. It is because within the human body there is a thing shaped like a lotus, born of the true yang fire. Though called fire, it is in fact water; though called water, it is in fact fire. Speaking in terms of water, it does not flow to wet nor moisten downward. Speaking in terms of fire, it does not flame upward nor seek dryness. Fire qi concealed in water is called inner yang; water qi concealed in fire is called inner yin. Yin and yang gather essence in water and fire, thus taking form like the lotus. When this lotus is cultivated to maturity, it undergoes a thousand transformations—sometimes sweet as honey, large as a tangerine: this is the lotus. The fruit born on branches, the seed within the womb: this too is the lotus. Even as it becomes *jiaoli* and *huozao*, bearing a thousand names, all are but the manifest virtues of the golden elixir. Only when the lotus is cultivated properly within does its image naturally appear without.\n\nThe White Tiger is metal essence. If one can nurture it at home, preventing its wildness, then the crystalline radiance of metal essence emerges—emptiness gives birth to whiteness, the mysterious pearl takes form, thus round as the moon. Those who refine the elixir know only that the fire’s timing for the external elixir lies in the crucible, not realizing that for the internal elixir, the fire’s timing lies within oneself. The sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire; they did not commit the fire’s timing to writing. Thus Master Lü [Dongbin] instructed one to guard the true and embrace the one, aligning with the transformations of heaven and earth, so that yin and yang ascend and descend naturally, as if matching tally tokens.\n\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the body becomes pure yang—neither born nor destroyed, transcending the realm of things. What cage could confine it? What lifespan could limit it?\n\nTo learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality;\nOnly the golden elixir is most certain.\nWhen the two things meet, emotion and nature unite;\nWhere the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil.\nOriginally through *wu* and *ji* as matchmakers,\nHusband and wife are thus bound in joy.\nAwaiting only the completion of the work to ascend the Jade Palace,\nAmidst ninefold radiance, riding a soaring simurgh.\n\nZhong [Li Quan] and Lü [Dongbin] inquired: Among men, one cultivates to become an immortal; among immortals, one ascends to become celestial. The immortal is one—why then is there a distinction of ascending to heaven? It is because the purely yin without yang is a ghost; the purely yang without yin is an immortal; the mingling of yin and yang is a human. Only humans can become ghosts or immortals. Yet immortals have five ranks: first, celestial immortals; second, spirit immortals; third, earthbound immortals; fourth, ghost immortals; fifth, human immortals.\n\nHow then does one cultivate to become a celestial immortal? Not through methods, not through techniques, not through qi, not through force—only by accumulating virtue and merit to refine the golden elixir. What is the golden elixir? It is nothing more than the union of two things, the perfection of the five phases, attaining long life and enduring vision to become an immortal.\n\nThe Most High said: Dimly, dimly—within it there is a thing. Vaguely, vaguely—within it there is essence. These two things are the sun and moon, the hun and po, the mating of yin and yang. Modeling heaven and emulating its images, at the time of their union, one is moved and thus attains the Dao. The wonder of emotion and nature is what is meant by \"once in thirty days they meet.\" As for the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, earth; heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys—gathering their essential spirits, not using their physical forms, ensuring not one is deficient, yin and yang fully present, naturally the dragon and tiger coil, the spirit becomes mighty. This can repel external demons and guard the great Dao.\n\nTracing to the source, how can the three things unite on their own? How can the five phases perfect themselves? It is only because the earth of *wu* and *ji* sits in the central palace, drawing east and west together, preventing separation. This is what is meant by the union of metal and wood, the mating of water and fire—like husband and wife in joyful union, all through the power of the matchmaker. Cultivating thus within the formless, forming images in the imageless, accumulating days and months, broadly performing hidden merits, mysteriously aligning with heaven and earth, naturally the body returns to pure yang. Ascending in broad daylight, one pays homage to the Jade Emperor in the Golden Portal, rides a colored simurgh through the purple clouds, soars amidst the ninefold radiance, and roams beyond the eight limits.\n\nIs not the ultimate effect of learning immortality indeed the celestial immortal?\n\nTo know where the medicine’s river-source is produced,\nOnly in the southwest is the native land.\nWhen lead sees *gui* born, swiftly gather it;\nWhen metal meets the full moon, it is not yet ripe to taste.\nSend it back to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly,\nThen join it with flowing pearls to pair them.\nThe medicine weighs one catty, requiring two eights;\nAdjust the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"In the southwest one gains companions; in the northeast one loses companions.\" The southwest is the *kun* position, the direction where the sun and moon’s hun and po seek each other. At the end of each month, on the thirtieth day at dawn’s twilight, the moon emerges at *yi*, the sun at *jia*—*jia* and *yi* unite, thus \"in the southwest one gains companions.\" That night, the moon’s brilliance leaves no trace, thus \"in the northeast one loses companions.\" Now Master Lü [Dongbin] says the river-source of the medicine’s production lies only in the southwest—is this not because the moon emerges from *kun*, and the *zhen* trigram first receives it? *Kun* transforms into *zhen*, the moon’s yang hun is newly born, thus able to suspend its image and display its brightness. This is what is meant by \"on the third day *geng* is born, the *dui* gate opens; black silver yields white silver.\"\n\nMoreover, it is said: \"When the moon rises over the mountain’s peak, the medicinal sprout is newly born\"—this is precisely where the river-source of its production lies. Though the moon is the essence and emblem of *Taiyin*, corresponding to metal and water, it in truth steals the sun’s yang radiance to shine. Tracing it to the water born of *Tianyi*, without the lead of metal it cannot be generated; thus when metal flourishes, water is born, and when the moon waxes full, the tide swells high. Now, if one gathers this lead at the time when *gui* is born, it is the mother concealing the child in her womb—if I can gather it for the use of the golden elixir, this is precisely the moment when the solitary yang first stirs to form the elixir. Should metal encounter the distant full moon, then only after the fifteenth day does the moon begin to grow its *po*; this *po* belongs to yin, and from the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the *po* fills while the *hun* wanes, yang declines and yin prevails—such metal is unfit for consumption. Since metal at the distant full moon is unfit, one must swiftly seek the lead born of *gui*, which is the gold within water, and having obtained it, return it to the earthen crucible’s central chamber, pairing it with *liuzhu* and refining it with fire-tending. Seal it tightly to prevent any risk of escape; balance the weights evenly to avoid any excess or deficiency. How then could the golden elixir fail to form?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"Mercury is the sun’s flowing pearl,\nThe Azure Dragon attends it;\nRaising the east to meet the west,\nHun and po naturally bind.\nThe upper crescent counts eight in *dui*,\nThe lower crescent counts eight as well;\nWhen the two crescents join their essence,\nThe body of Qian and Kun is complete.\nTwo eights make one catty—\nThe Dao of Change stands firm and true.\"*\n\nThis perfectly accords with the verse. Do not mistake solitary yin for possessing yang, for cultivating this alone will only lead to emaciation. Exerting the body with postures and stretches is not the Way; refining qi and ingesting mist is sheer madness. The world vainly seeks the subjugation of mercury and gold—when will they ever witness the descent of tiger and dragon? I urge you to thoroughly seek the place of your own birth: returning to the root and restoring the origin is the King of Medicines.\n\nMaster Yunfang’s *Zhixuan Pian* says:\n*\"Tears, sleep-drool, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—\nThese seven have ever belonged to yin.\nIf one takes these as the substance of immortality,\nHow can one’s spirit soar to the Jade Capital?\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—\nWho knows what thing is yang’s essence?\nIf by good fortune you meet a luminous teacher’s guidance,\nThe Dao and immortality are yours in this very moment.\"*\n\nThese poems guide lost learners with such profound clarity! Yet the Buddhists, clinging to vacuity, sit sated and face the wall, believing that cutting off desire and preserving essence and qi can lead to the Dao. I see only their bodies withering, their forms weakening, growing ever more emaciated, until the bell tolls and the water-clock runs dry—at last they become mere ghosts of yin’s good spirits. Even worse are those ignorant Dao-seekers who merely crane their necks like bears or stretch like crows, ingest mist and refine qi, or mistake the heart and kidneys for mercury and gold, the liver and lungs for dragon and tiger—all blind cultivation and reckless refinement, unaware of the true yang’s ancestral source. How then can they return to the root, restore the origin, and attain the great medicine?\n\nThough at the outset of entering the Dao, one closely observes the human body—nothing more than tears, saliva, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids; heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—all nourishing this illusory form, how can one claim they all belong to yin? Beyond these, is there truly no real yang to be found? My heart has long been unsatisfied. For twenty years, Master Yunfang perused the *Daoist Canon*, consulted the Nine Schools, and met countless so-called Daoists—all saying only to swallow saliva and gulp down drool. Yet in all the world, none could resolve this doubt. Even the *Guanyuan Yuan Dadao Ge* merely states that this thing originally has no fixed position, transforming with the mind’s intent: in the body, when feeling heat it becomes sweat; in the nose, when struck by wind it becomes mucus; in the kidneys, when aroused it becomes essence; in the eyes, when grieved it becomes tears—still not revealing what true yang truly is. The *Taishang Qibao Wulou Jing* likewise says: \"To nourish the spirit, first nourish qi; to nourish qi, first nourish tears; to nourish tears, first nourish mucus; to nourish mucus, first nourish saliva; to nourish saliva, first nourish blood; to nourish blood, first nourish essence; to nourish essence, first nourish fluids; to nourish fluids, first nourish water.\" Water is the flower-pool’s saliva, the essence of primordial qi, found in the tongue’s cavity—yet it still does not speak of the reality of yang essence. This only deepens confusion, leaving one’s heart and mind bewildered, as if questioning ghosts and spirits without resolution.\n\nThose who cultivate this alone indeed grow frail: some hearts restless and vexed, some loins heavy and stiff, some dreamless yet leaking. With guiding and breathing, day and night, they may briefly recover, but if interrupted by busyness, a hundred illnesses assail them, and medicines are taken in vain—not only futile, but gravely harmful. Onlookers secretly mock, fellow Daoists lose heart and retreat. Only my foolish self remains unshaken, my faith in the Dao ever firmer. I say: can the sagely worthies of old, who bequeathed teachings to the world, have erred in misleading later generations? It is only that my own practice is not steadfast, my teacher’s transmission not true. Resolutely, I cast off the cage, traversed famous mountains and grottoes, silently prayed to the unseen, seeking to fathom the mystery’s pointer. Suddenly, at Dragon-Tiger Mountain, I first received an auspicious dream; then on Zhurong Peak, I encountered a sagely teacher—its details are fully recorded in *The Full Account of My Encounter with the Immortal*. At last, I obtained the secret of true yang, which can subdue the four great yin elements of the body—neither essence nor qi, neither kidney nor heart, neither tears nor saliva, neither blood nor fluids.\n\nThe place of this thing’s birth precedes heaven and earth; the place of its dissolution precedes heaven and earth’s end. The five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—converge here; the five viscera—heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—concentrate their numen here; the seven substances—tears, saliva, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—crystallize their excellence here. In its vastness, even heaven and earth can contain it.\n\nIn its smallness, not even a mote of dust can enter.\nIn its function, it has neither interior nor exterior.\nIn its attainment, there is neither sage nor commoner.\nThe people use it daily yet do not know it; the sage alone can fathom its root and origin.\nShould one grasp the marvel of the seven returns and nine revolutions, this may become the sovereign medicine, the root of the Dao.\nThen the myriad yin substances will circulate through the four limbs like a child clinging to its mother, never parting.\nThe heart will not be restless, the perineum will not burn, the waist will not feel heavy, and dreams will not leak.\nSpirit and qi will merge in harmony, the radiance of essence will illuminate all things—how could there be any affliction of frailty?\nThe eyes will flash like lightning, the beard will be black as lacquer, the mind will attain foresight, and one will respond to ten thousand affairs without weariness.\nMercury and gold will naturally submit, dragon and tiger will naturally descend.\nNot through the extraction of sinews or the breaking of bones, nor through the expulsion of the old and absorption of the new, but naturally one’s virtue will unite with heaven and earth, one’s brightness will unite with the sun and moon, one’s order will unite with the four seasons, and one’s fortune will unite with the spirits.\nTruly, I possess some measure of immortal arts—not among the three thousand six hundred schools.\n\nProfound! Wondrous! This is not to be transmitted without swearing oaths to heaven and earth, nor passed from father to son.\nThose who violate this will incur heavenly calamity and human punishment, with no recourse to prayer.\n\nIn plants and trees, yin and yang are also paired as one:\nIf either is lacking, they will not flourish.\nFirst, green leaves unfold as yang takes the lead;\nNext, red flowers bloom as yin follows after.\nThis is the constant Dao of daily use,\nYet who knows the true source of its ebb and flow?\nI say to all who study the Dao:\nDo not scorn what you do not understand of yin and yang.\nThe Dao is called the unity of yin and yang;\nAn excess of either is called illness.\nIs the teaching of yin and yang in balance mere empty talk?\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang,\nAnd cannot tolerate the slightest imbalance.\nIf yang is excessive without yin, yang has nothing to transform;\nIf yin is excessive without yang, yin has nothing to generate.\nTake plants and trees as an example:\nGreen leaves unfold first—this is yang’s primal arising.\nRed flowers follow after—this is yin’s subsequent flourishing.\nIn their arising, they grow and mature through spring and summer;\nIn their flourishing, they return to the root and restore life in autumn and winter.\nIf one embodies this as the constant Dao of daily practice,\nThen day is yang, night is yin;\nMidnight is yang, noon is yin.\nYin and yang alternate in their movement, each requiring the other to complete the Dao.\nThe true source ebbs and flows, giving rise to endless generation—this is uniting one’s virtue with heaven and earth.\n\nThough yin and yang are paired as one, they are not rigidly divided into two separate things.\nWithin yin, yang is never absent;\nWithin yang, yin is never absent.\nThus, the sun is the great yang, yet within it is the yin of the golden crow;\nThe moon is the great yin, yet within it is the yang of the jade hare.\nYin and yang are paired as one, mutually engendering transformation—\nThose who study the Dao should not lightly dismiss this.\n\nThe myriad volumes of alchemical scriptures all speak in unison:\nThe golden elixir is but this, the root and origin.\nFollowing earth’s position, the body of generation takes form;\nPlanted in heaven’s domain, the palace of union and response.\nDo not blame the celestial mechanism for being revealed today—\nIt is only because those who study the Dao remain deluded.\nIf one comprehends the meaning within this verse,\nOne will immediately behold the Three Pure Ones and the Most High Lord.\n\nQian and Kun are the gates of the *Book of Changes*, the parents of all hexagrams.\nIf one who studies the Dao does not first cultivate the two hexagrams Qian and Kun,\nIt is like a person without parents—how can they be born?\nNow, Kun’s position is the southwest, Qian’s position is the northwest.\nKun is pure yin, Qian is pure yang.\nYin and yang being pure, they are utterly distant and distinct—how could they generate transformation?\nOnly because Kun’s position holds the body of generation,\nAnd Qian’s domain contains the palace of union and response.\nMaster Lian (Peng Xiao) explored the profound and probed the hidden,\nDrew forth the distant and gathered the subtle,\nRevealing the secret mysteries of the *Cantong Qi*\nAnd expounding the profound subtleties of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*.\nAbove, he could take the place of the Most High in teaching the Dao;\nBelow, he could enlighten later generations.\nAfter Zhong and Lü, only Master Lian stood alone—\nHow majestic! How splendid!\n\nMoreover, though the alchemical scriptures number in the tens of thousands,\nWith principles, methods, and techniques appearing vast and intricate,\nThe teachings on the golden elixir are all the same.\nThe three thousand six hundred minor methods and side doors,\nEven if one were to gather them all, would not be the Dao.\nWhat, then, is the Dao?\nIt is uniting one’s virtue with heaven and earth.\nThus, Qian is heaven, Kun is earth.\nHeaven is yang, earth is yin.\nThough their positions seem distant,\nThe six children mutually generate, yin and yang alternate in succession,\nAs seen in the union of the sun and moon.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: If heaven and earth do not unite, the myriad things will not flow.\nHeaven and earth unite once a month, Qian and Kun transform six times a month.\nFrom Kun comes generation, from Qian comes union and response.\nThus, in the beginning, Kun transforms three times to become Qian;\nIn the end, Qian transforms three times to return to Kun.\nTheir operation is endless, cycling without cease.\nBy this, the new and full moons are determined, the crescents and full phases are completed.\nThe circulation of the twenty-four qi, the passage of the celestial degrees—\nAll that fashions the myriad things into the work of the year\nIs the function of Qian, Kun, and the six children.\nHow is this made clear?\nThe *Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic* says: On the third day, the moon emerges in the west at Geng, dividing at Mao and You.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: Above Bi and Xu, Zhen emerges, proving the inception of yang qi.\nNow, Geng and Bi and Xu are all positions of the west, Kun’s domain.\nThe moon, born in this place of Kun’s pure yin, receives pure yin qi.\nIts qi being yin, its body is heavy, its nature must be dim—\nHow can it illuminate the eight directions, entering the east and exiting the west, yet operate endlessly?\nThe moon cannot shine on its own; it must receive the qi of true yang before it can shine.\nThus, on the third day, the moon begins to wax, appearing in Kun’s western domain.\nKun transforms once to become Zhen, and Zhen governs the six Geng.\nGeng is the celestial stem corresponding to Zhen’s hexagram—\nThis is how yin and yang can shine.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: On the third day, the moon emerges as \"scouring brightness,\" with Zhen receiving Geng in the western direction. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, establishing its foundation through the mother. As Master Pingshu says: On the third day, Geng is born and Zhen’s gate opens—this is the black-silver furnace yielding white silver. Kun transforms a second time to become Dui, and Dui governs the moon’s emergence on the eighth day in Ding’s domain. Dui governs the six Ding, corresponding to Dui’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: On the eighth day, the moon emerges in Ding, its upper arc weighing half a catty of metal. The *Cantong Qi* states: Dui receives Ding’s tally, its upper arc straight as a plumb line. As Pingshu says: When the moon first appears at the sky’s edge as a half-wheel, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound.\n\nKun transforms a third time to become Qian, and Qian governs the moon’s emergence on the fifteenth day in Jia’s domain. Qian governs the six Jia, corresponding to Qian’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: On the fifteenth day, the three yang are complete, round and illuminating Jia in the east. Metal and water warm the great yang, red marrow flows as mercury, and the maidens play in the radiant moonlight. The *Cantong Qi* states: When the three and five virtues are complete, Qian’s body is fully formed. That night, the moon’s brilliance is full, and the great yin shines brightly. Yet it is not yin’s power that illuminates—it is the true yang at its zenith. However, when yang flourishes, it must strike yin, and when things reach their extreme, they revert to their origin. Waxing and waning, growth and decline—such is the natural principle of heaven. The *Upper Classic* says: When the moon waxes to its fullness, it must wane. On the sixteenth day, it begins to diminish, as Qian’s yang line is broken to form Xun. At dawn, the moon aligns with Xin. From the sixteenth day onward, the moon emerges in Xin’s domain, as Qian’s first reduction forms Xun. Xun governs the six Xin, corresponding to Xun’s hexagram. At this time, the moon’s light returns to the sun, and the yang line must wane. The *Cantong Qi* states: The divine tally wanes and breaks, its flourishing and decline gradually transforming, ultimately returning to its origin, with Xun inheriting its mandate.\n\nFrom the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth day, the moon emerges in Bing’s southern domain, as Qian’s second reduction forms Gen. Gen governs the six Bing, corresponding to Gen’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: Qian’s second reduction forms Gen, and on the twenty-third day, the lower arc weighs half a catty of water. The *Cantong Qi* states: Gen governs advance and retreat, not overstepping its time. From the twenty-sixth to the thirtieth day, the moon emerges in Yi’s domain, as Qian’s third reduction forms Kun. Kun governs the six Yi, corresponding to Kun’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: Qian’s third transformation forms Kun, and on the thirtieth day, Kun-Yi loses its companion in the northeast. The moon sets in Yi-Kun, and as Yi-Kun’s moon wanes, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform. Following Kun, Zhen’s dragon is born, and Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end. The *Cantong Qi* states: The five and six of Kun’s succession bind the beginning and end. This is the return to the origin, the alternation of yin and yang—its Dao is greatly luminous, its function inexhaustible. It is called the union of heaven and earth, the conjunction of sun and moon. It is called Qian’s three searches giving birth to three sons, and Kun’s three searches giving birth to three daughters. Male and female intermingle, yin and yang pair—is this not relying on Kun’s position to form the body, planting the seed in Qian’s domain to stir the senses?\n\nAlas! The sun is heaven’s hun-soul, the blood and marrow of the great Dao. The moon is earth’s po-soul, the essence and qi of the great Dao. The great Dao does not lose its sun and moon, and so endures for kalpas without end. The human body does not lose its sun and moon, and so attains deathlessness and eternal life. Yet scholars are deluded, their natural endowments dull. Worse still, some take the false as the norm, wine as their drink, and the six desires and seven emotions sever their original true nature. They become walking corpses, phoenixes in flight—far removed from the human Dao. How can they partake in the way of the three powers standing as one?\n\nNow, Pingshu has revealed the celestial mechanism, directly pointing to the mysterious pass and essential path. One who comprehends this profound meaning will find that the august Three Pure Ones are not distant from oneself. As the saying goes: \"One attainment is eternal attainment,\" and one immediately ascends to the sacred rank. This principle is most profound and wondrous. Without innate spiritual bone and unwavering resolve to cultivate the Dao, even if one encounters a sage-teacher, they will often miss the mark. Scholars, take heed!\n\nWithout recognizing true lead and the correct lineage,\nAll efforts are in vain, labor wasted.\nDismissing one’s wife only severs yin and yang,\nFasting merely empties the stomach and bowels.\nHerbs, metals, gold, and silver are but coarse matter,\nClouds, mist, sun, and moon remain obscure.\nEven with breath control and visualization,\nNone compare to the work of the golden elixir.\n\nThe path of cultivation prioritizes restraint of desire—does this poem encourage indulgence? No. The great Dao is non-action, while side paths involve much ado. People mistakenly believe that avoiding women, abstaining from cooked food, refining elixirs, consuming mist, practicing breath control, or visualizing the kidneys and heart encompass the Dao’s profound mysteries. Yet forced restraint does not arise from nature, and deliberate action is not free from delusion. Moreover, lead has the true and the ordinary, the ancestral and the secondary—truly not easy to discern. If one receives transmission from a teacher, the Dao is present at a glance, and the radiant golden elixir forms in a single day. Without such guidance, blind practice and haphazard refinement may bring comfort and longevity, slightly better than those who recklessly abandon life and lose their origin. Yet they remain unrelated to the great path of the golden elixir.\n\nAlthough the Heavenly Master lineage has endured thirty-six generations, and Master Xu Jingshan’s family has over forty members ascending in broad daylight, or Liu An the Prince and Liu Gang practicing dual cultivation with their wives, or Wei Boyang having a son in official service—none attained the Dao by dismissing wives or fasting. There is no other reason: some achieved the Dao in boyhood, others cultivated after marriage. All progressed through inner practice and accumulating hidden virtue, advancing from the lesser vehicle to the middle vehicle, and from the middle to the greater vehicle. None attained the great Dao in a single leap.\n\nMaster Pingshu’s intent is not to sweep away all the unprofitable side paths but to emphasize the profound form of the Golden Elixir’s Way—scholars must not let the words obscure the meaning.\n\n\"Three, five, and one\" are but three characters,\nYet those who truly understand them through the ages are rare indeed.\nBind three from the east and two from the south to make five,\nOne from the north and four from the west share the same.\nWu and Ji reside in their native generative numbers,\nWhen the three families meet, the infant is formed.\nThe infant is the One containing true qi,\nAfter ten months of gestation, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid.\n\nThe \"three and five\" make fifteen.\nAdding one yields sixteen.\nSixteen is the number of two eights.\nSeekers of the Way through the ages have variously taken \"two eights\" as *mao* and *you*, or as one *jin*.\nLittle do they know that the great Way of the Golden Elixir does not transcend the creative transformations of the Five Phases, and the creative transformations of the Five Phases do not escape the great numbers of Heaven and Earth.\nHow to clarify this?\nFor when two and eight combine, their number is ten.\nTen as a number encompasses the secrets of the Five Phases and weaves the warp of Heaven and Earth.\nThus, Heaven One generates Water, and Earth Six completes it.\nEarth Two generates Fire, and Heaven Seven completes it.\nHeaven Three generates Wood, and Earth Eight completes it.\nEarth Four generates Metal, and Heaven Nine completes it.\nHeaven Five generates Earth, and Earth Ten completes it.\nThis—Heaven One and Earth Two, Heaven Three and Earth Four, Heaven Five and Earth Six, Heaven Seven and Earth Eight, Heaven Nine and Earth Ten—is none other than the great generative numbers.\nThe immortals’ veiled language does not say \"ten\" but \"two eights,\"\nNor \"sixteen\" but \"three, five, one.\"\nSeekers of old and present are as numerous as ox hairs, yet those who comprehend are as rare as qilin horns.\nTruly, those who understand this Way are few indeed.\n\nThough the generative numbers of Heaven and Earth do not exceed ten, the marvelous workings of the Five Phases’ transformations ultimately return to five.\nFor five is the number of Earth, and Earth is the progenitor of the Elixir.\nThe three of the east (Wood) and the two of the south (Fire) belong to the yang position and together form five.\nThe one of the north (Water) and the four of the west (Metal) occupy the yin position and likewise form five.\nAs for Wu and Ji, they naturally generate Earth from the number five.\n\nNow, why does Master Pingshu speak not of the harmony of the Four Symbols or the gathering of the Five Phases but only of the meeting of the three families?\nFor Metal and Wood, without the mandate to separate, find Earth residing in the center as their matchmaker—these are the three families.\nWater and Fire, transformed through the *jiji* configuration, find Earth residing in the center as their mediator—these too are the three families.\nAs the saying goes, \"When they meet Earth, they become three clans.\"\nWithout Wu and Ji, the Elixir cannot be formed.\nThe infant is knit from these three families—it is the child nurtured within the Void.\n\nYet the formation of the infant does not come from without; all arises from the true Unity of the Great One and the primordial qi, returning to the origin and reverting to oneself.\nAt first, Heaven bestows and Earth generates, receiving the legacy of one’s parents, and through ten months of gestation, the physical body is nurtured.\nNow, returning to the origin, one seizes the creative transformations of yin and yang, and likewise through ten months, transcends the mundane and enters sagehood.\nWithin the profound lies the wondrous, within the wondrous lies the marvelous—beyond the ken of mortal dust.\n\nThis is the secret purport of Master Pingshu’s *Awakening to Reality*, revealed in the poem of \"three, five, one.\"\nWithout encountering an immortal teacher, scholars recklessly force interpretations.\nI, undeterred by my inadequacy, have elucidated it in detail to bring clarity.\nSome may fault me for excessive disclosure, to which I reply:\nThose who crave tea do not enter taverns; those fond of sensuality do not delight in pure abstinence.\nThe common folk, bound by their karmic tendencies, cannot be uniformly transformed.\nIf one is ignorant of the study of nature and destiny, even with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as teachers and Confucius and Yan Hui as friends, instructing them face-to-face, those without the affinity of ice and charcoal are few.\nWhat use would they find in these five words?\n\nShould one possess innate spiritual bones and obtain this key, interpreting the text to grasp its meaning, then across a thousand years and ten thousand miles, one’s heart meets the author—what greater fortune could there be?\nAs the saying goes, \"Carrying a hundred gold pieces through the market and losing them on the road, those who find and use them value even five gold pieces as no loss.\"\nThus, met with silence, I have respectfully written these sixteen detailed explanations to dispel the world’s delusions.\n\n*Lecture Notes on the \"Awakening to Reality\" of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Two, Concluded.*\n\n**Lecture Notes on the \"Awakening to Reality\" of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Three**\n*By Yunfeng Sanren, Xia Zongyu of Yongjia*\n\nSixty-four quatrains to correspond to the sixty-four hexagrams:\n\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,\nThen use the Crow and Hare to boil the medicine.\nIf you can drive these two things into the Yellow Path,\nHow could the Yellow Sprout fail to grow?\n\nQian is Heaven, Kun is Earth.\nQian is yang, Kun is yin.\nHeaven’s yang is above, Earth’s yin is below.\nOnce above and below are fixed, the form of the crucible and vessel is complete.\n\nThe Crow is the sun, the Hare is the moon.\nThe sun is yang, the moon is yin.\nThe sun’s yang arises in the east, the moon’s yin arises in the west.\nOnce east and west are divided, the medicines must be kept apart.\n\nThe Yellow Path is the central, correct position of the Five Phases.\nThe Yellow Sprout is the numinous shoot of the Golden Elixir.\nIf Heaven and Earth use Qian and Kun as crucible and vessel,\nHow could the crucible and vessel of our bodies fail to embody the function of Qian and Kun?\nIf Heaven and Earth use the Crow and Hare as medicines,\nHow could the medicines of our bodies not refine the essence of the Crow and Hare?\n\nYet there are crucibles of both the *Already Achieved* and the *Not Yet Achieved*,\nNeither of which can neglect the work of water and fire.\nThus, the refining of metal depends on water and fire,\nBut water and fire cannot sustain themselves—\nThey must rely on the virtue of Earth to complete the work.\nWithout *wu* and *ji*, the Elixir cannot form.\nIf one can daily refine and hourly boil,\nDriving the two things into the central palace of the True Earth,\nThen the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir will sprout and grow,\nDaily receiving the harmonious qi of the eastern wind until it reaches the state of pure yang.\nWhat is called \"the flower of the heart blooming in clarity, the fruit of the Dao perfected,\"\nLarge as an orange and sweet as honey—\nAll arises from the flourishing of this Yellow Sprout.\n\nThe method of setting up the furnace and establishing the crucible follows Qian and Kun,\nTempering the essence to govern the *po* and *hun*.\nGathering and dispersing, misty and swirling, they form transformations—\nHow dare one presume to speak of fixed forms in advance?\n\nThe furnace is set up externally, the crucible established internally.\nThough the model lies in the vessel, its essence is the body of Qian and Kun.\nThus, borrowing this crucible and vessel to refine the medicines,\nThe sun’s essence, the moon’s radiance, the sun’s *hun*, the moon’s *po*—\nThese two things gather and disperse, their qi misty and swirling, forming transformations,\nSo that the Golden Elixir may be achieved.\nHow dare one presume to speak of fixed forms?\nFor the spirit has no fixed form, and the *Yi* has no fixed body—\nThis is the mystery within mystery, the subtlety within subtlety,\nNot a matter of learning through words or ears.\n\nThe workings of the inner and outer Elixirs share this formless, bodiless wonder,\nBeyond thought, beyond description.\nIf the scholar has the affinity,\nThen through heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction,\nOnce attained, it is attained forever.\nWithout relying on written words,\nIt directly points to the mystery of the supreme vehicle,\nAscending to sagehood and attaining immortality in an instant.\n\nDo not cling to the elixir furnace and waste effort—\nTo refine the medicine, seek the Reclining Moon Furnace.\nIt naturally possesses the true fire of Heaven’s nurturing,\nWith no need for firewood, charcoal, or blowing.\n\nThe Dao of the Elixir runs deep.\nThere is the inner Elixir and the outer Elixir.\nThe inner Elixir refines the radiance of the sun and moon,\nGathers the true spirit of the original spirit—\nThis is returning to the root and reverting to the origin, the supreme Dao.\nThe outer Elixir takes true lead and true mercury,\nAdjusts the fire times, adds and withdraws,\nTo form the medicine of long life.\nIf one has the inner Elixir but not the outer,\nThough the Dao may be attained, the physical body remains heavy,\nUnable to escape cold and heat, and cannot ascend in flight.\nOne must obtain the outer Elixir to transform the physical form,\nSo that the foul and rotten may give birth to the divine and wondrous.\nIf one has the outer Elixir but not the inner,\nIt is like \"boiling an empty pot with water and fire when there is no true seed within\"—\nThe divine and wondrous will revert to the foul and rotten.\n\nMaster Pingshu’s poem does not mean to entirely reject the outer Elixir,\nBut pities that the world knows only the outer and not the inner,\nSo he uses the metaphor of firewood, charcoal, and the elixir furnace to enlighten them.\nThe Reclining Moon Furnace is the vessel for refining the Elixir within the human body,\nIts shape like the moon’s first crescent.\nIt naturally possesses the true fire of yang,\nNurtured by the four seasons, illuminating Heaven and Earth,\nThus requiring no firewood, charcoal, or blowing.\nAs for the refining of the outer Elixir, these cannot be dispensed with—\nThis is merely speaking in reverse.\n\nIn the Reclining Moon Furnace, the Jade Medicine grows;\nIn the Cinnabar Crucible, the mercury levels.\nOnly after the fire force is harmonized,\nDoes the Yellow Sprout gradually mature.\n\nThe workings of the inner and outer Elixirs are the same:\nSetting up the furnace, establishing the crucible,\nRefining cinnabar and mercury—\nAll rely on water and fire as the foundation.\nFor fire can generate Earth, Earth can generate Metal,\nAnd the Yellow Sprout is the numinous shoot of the Golden Elixir.\nThis refers to the crucible and medicines of the outer Elixir,\nTo illustrate the crucible and medicines of our bodies.\n\nSome mistakenly take the Reclining Moon Furnace as the shape of the inner kidneys,\nOr the Cinnabar Crucible as the symbol of the red heart—\nBoth are wrong.\nOthers take the Jade Medicine and mercury as the essence and fluids—\nThese are also incorrect.\nThough the furnace resembles the Reclining Moon\nAnd the crucible uses cinnabar,\nThough their symbolic forms differ,\nThey are in truth the same vessel for refining the Golden Elixir within the human body.\nThough the Jade Medicine and mercury are differently named,\nThey are in truth the same mother of the Golden Elixir within the human body.\nIf one can skillfully add and withdraw, advance and retreat the fire,\nAscending and descending in accord with Heaven and Earth,\nUniting like the sun and moon,\nWith the fire times harmonized without the slightest error,\nNaturally the Yellow Sprout will sprout and flourish,\nAuspicious qi will swirl and gather,\nThe Golden Elixir will form as treasure,\nAnd one will be coeval with Heaven and Earth.\n\nSwallowing fluids and absorbing qi is what humans do,\nBut only with the right substance can the myriad things be born.\n\"If there is no true seed within,\nIt is like boiling an empty pot with water and fire.\"\n\nFluids are water, qi is fire.\nIn the human body, fluids moisten it, qi moves it—\nWater and fire nurture each other, enabling long life.\nBut when desires and cravings flourish,\nExhausting the original source of water and fire,\nThe true essence is depleted—\nLike a tree without roots,\nThough it may be touched by rain and dew, it cannot stand on its own.\n\nNow that the true origin is already lost, merely swallowing fluids and absorbing qi is like using water and fire to boil an empty pot—it not only brings no benefit but also causes harm.\n\nWhen it comes to this, preserving the Great Harmony and each fulfilling its nature and destiny—who but the purely yang, the unceasingly vigorous and strong of *qian*, could achieve this?\n\nTo harmonize lead and mercury and form the Elixir,\nBoth great and small must remain unharmed, both realms preserved intact.\nIf you ask what true lead is—\nIt is the toad’s radiance, shining all day upon the Western River.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is formed from lead and mercury,\nAnd their perfect balance is the wonder.\nIf one side prevails excessively, harmony is lost—\nThen either the great is harmed, or the small.\nHow can the Elixir form when the two *qi* wax and wane?\nThe deluded deem yang noble and great, yin base and small,\nAnd take \"the small departing, the great arriving\" as the return of solitary yang—unharmed.\nAll this is forced interpretation.\nThey do not know that the Golden Elixir cannot form alone;\nIt requires one lead and one mercury, each belonging to its own realm.\nOnly when fire times are harmonized and the two merged into one\nDoes the Elixir coalesce.\nThus it is said: *\"Different names, same origin—few understand.\"*\n\nThe two are the subtle mechanism of the profound mystery.\nIf you ask of true lead’s form and name—\nIt is like the toad’s luminous essence, shining all day upon the Western River.\nFor the toad’s essence is the moon’s water,\nAnd the Western River is the metal of *kun* and *shen*.\nThe *Dragon-Tiger Classic* says: *\"On the third day, the moon emerges at geng,\nWestward divided between mao and you.\"*\nThis is the image of metal giving birth to water,\nWhen the moon’s toad essence begins to form.\nThe moon, being of water and yin, is dark by nature—\nIt cannot illuminate itself but must borrow the fire of the great yang to shine.\nThus the toad’s light persists all day.\nIt is like a mirror of bronze or iron,\nFreshly cast and dull, utterly lacking brightness to reflect anything.\nOnly when lead and tin are applied does its radiance burst forth,\nRivaling the sun and moon in brilliance.\nWhy? Bronze and iron are yin;\nLead and tin are yang.\nYin borrows yang to become luminous.\nThe *Triple Unison* says: *\"The sun unites the essence of the Five Phases,\nThe moon receives the measure of the Six Pitches.\"* This is the principle.\n\nDo not hide in the mountains to refine the Returning Elixir—\nWithin and without the mountains, there is no true lead.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nYet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.\n\nThe great hermit dwells in the marketplace,\nThe lesser in the mountains.\nFor the cliffs are where ten eyes gaze and ten fingers point—\nThe bustling city, where a thousand treasures and a hundred goods gather.\nIf the adept resides here, the Elixir’s work is easily accomplished.\nThis is not external alchemy.\nIt is like the human body, which also has its marketplace—\nWhere the hundred bones and hundred vessels converge,\nWhere the seven treasures and six yangs reside.\nIf the cultivator applies effort here, the Returning Elixir may be achieved.\nAs for the mountains—remote, secluded, steeped in utmost yin—\nWhat refuge do they offer?\nIt is like seeking utmost yin in the practice of the Elixir,\nAs Master Yunfang said of tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humor—\nAll seven belong to yin.\nIs this not *\"within and without the mountains, no true lead exists\"*?\n\nMaster Pingshu said: To restore the Elixir, one must cultivate true yang,\nNot utmost yin.\nThe treasure of true yang is possessed by all at birth—\nNo distinction of noble or base, small or great, monk or Daoist, mortal or immortal.\nAs we Confucians say: *\"Where there is a thing, there is a principle;\nThe constant nature is ever present.\"*\nThis is the meaning of *\"the supreme treasure exists in every household.\"*\n\nTo mend bamboo, use bamboo;\nTo hatch a chick, use an egg.\nStriving with all manner of mismatched things is labor in vain—\nHow can it compare to true lead uniting with the sacred mechanism?\n\nLike attracts like, things gather by kind—\nThe *Great Change* has long declared this.\nHow much more so the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,\nWhich does not lie beyond our own bodies?\nIts mechanism responds in silence, in accord with Heaven and Earth.\nOne must seek the root, pluck the stem, return to the origin—\nThen the supreme Way is not complex.\nIf one grasps at all manner of mismatched things,\nFailing to recognize the yang of true lead—\nIt is like stitching flowers in hope of fruit.\nWhat has this to do with the Way?\n\nThus we know:\nWith bamboo, mend bamboo;\nWith an egg, hatch a chick;\nWith true lead, unite with the sacred mechanism.\nWhy? It is like using original essence to replenish original *qi*,\nOr original *qi* to replenish original spirit—\nAll follow the natural path of resonance,\nUsing true yang to gather constant yin.\nIf one employs common lead or mismatched substances,\nIt is labor in vain.\n\nDo not use common lead—use true lead,\nAnd when true lead has served its purpose, discard it.\nThis is the true and wondrous secret of using lead:\n*\"Use lead, yet do not use it\"* is the sincere teaching.\n\nThe ancient immortals said:\n*\"Foxes and hares do not nurse horses,\nSwallows and sparrows do not hatch phoenixes.\nPlant millet to grow millet,\nRefine gold only with gold.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Lead is the mother of the sprout,\nThe sprout is the child of lead.\nOnce the golden flower is obtained,\nDiscard the lead and do not employ it.\"*\nThus we know:\nLead mothers differ in true and common,\nTheir use differs in sequence.\nTo nurture the child, one must first use true lead to lay the Elixir’s foundation.\nWhen the child matures into a village,\nThe lead mother must be cast aside to stand alone.\nThe ancient song of the Elixir’s secret says:\n*\"Nurture the child into a dragon, proud and lofty,\nThen despise the original mother as vulgar and clamorous.\"*\nThis speaks of external alchemy,\nBut scholars should grasp its application to internal alchemy.\nFor instance:\nGuarding the heart, contemplating the kidneys, treasuring *qi*, refining essence—\nAll embody the intent of using lead.\nYet when attaining the supreme, effortless Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,\nThe heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys,\nEssence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humor—\nAll must be set aside.\nThus *\"use lead, yet do not use it\"* is the sincere teaching.\n\nTo empty the heart and fill the abdomen—both meanings run deep,\nBut emptying the heart is to know the heart.\nBetter to first fill the abdomen by refining lead,\nThen guard the teaching and keep the hall filled with gold.\n\nA heart emptied is unstained by a single speck of dust—\nThus it can nurture the nature.\n\nA full abdomen preserves the supreme treasure without loss—\nThus can one nurture the elixir.\nThis is where the cultivator of truth plants hand and foot.\nYet世人 seek to empty the heart only to fill it again,\nAnd strive to fill the abdomen only to empty it—why?\nI observe those whose hearts are \"full\":\nA hundred thoughts swarm like hedgehogs, deluded and inverted,\nGreed, wrath, and ignorance chasing after things, forgetting to return—\nWhen have they ever truly known their own hearts?\nThose whose abdomens are \"empty\":\nIndulge in passions and desires, taking falsehood as the norm,\nDraining true *qi* and essence, seeking pleasure day and night—\nWhen have they ever truly filled their abdomens?\nThus Master Pingshu pitied them,\nAnd on the matter of emptying the heart and filling the abdomen, offered twofold warnings.\nIf one must choose where to begin,\nThen filling the abdomen cannot be delayed.\nFor the human heart is not easily emptied—\nEmptied, it shares the measure of heaven and earth,\nAnd roams with the Creator.\nOur Master Confucius followed his heart’s desires at seventy without overstepping the bounds—\nHow easily could such emptiness be attained?\nBut filling the abdomen may come first.\nIf one can temper indulgence in sensual pleasures,\nCurb excessive desires,\nPreserve true *qi*, and guard essence,\nThen lead may be refined, and the abdomen filled.\nWith gold and treasure filling the hall,\nOne may abide in the world and attain long life.\n\nIn a dream, I visited Xihua and ascended to the Ninth Heaven,\nWhere I was clearly bestowed the *Zhixuan Pian*.\nIts words are few and simple—\nOnly to teach you to refine mercury and lead.\n\nMaster Pingshu said: To learn immortality, one must learn *Tianxian* (Heavenly Immortality).\nFor the *Tianxian* departs from grotto-heavens,\nRanks among the Nine Heavens,\nRides clouds and commands winds,\nDrives carriages drawn by simurghs and cranes,\nAnd descends to the imperial court.\nThough the great earth and mountains may be bound by kalpas,\nThe joy and effortless freedom of the *Tianxian* remain unbound.\nHow is this attained?\nIts principle is profound, its method simple—\nNothing more than refining the two substances: mercury and lead.\nThus, when the sincerity of the Dao-seeker moves heaven,\nEven in dreams, the gates of Xihua may be approached,\nAnd the *Tianxian* respectfully bestows the *Zhixuan Pian*,\nInstructing in the great medicine of refining lead and mercury.\nIts way is simple and easy to practice,\nUnlike the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, which are needlessly complex.\n\nThe Dao, from emptiness, gives birth to the One *qi*,\nAnd from the One *qi* arise yin and yang.\nYin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,\nAnd from the Three Bodies, the myriad things flourish.\nBefore the Great Simplicity scattered,\nThere was a thing formless yet complete—\nWho then were yin and yang?\nWho grasped the myriad things as such?\nFrom the Dao came the One—the One is the *Taiyi*, the *qi* containing truth.\nFrom the One came the Two—yin and yang, opening and closing in form.\nFrom the Two came the Three, and from the Three, the myriad things—scattered and distinct.\nIf the scholar can trace beginnings to their end,\nAnd know the Great Dao is nameless, rooted in the One *qi*,\nThen they may draw the One *qi* from the dim and indistinct,\nAnd with it forge the Golden Elixir.\nYin and yang will then unite as naturally as heaven and earth give birth to the myriad things,\nAnd one will stand as the Third Power alongside heaven and earth.\n\nThe thunder roars in the north, refining gold and water in the northwest,\nFire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.\nIf these two substances return to one place,\nThe medicine ripens, and fragrance suffuses the body.\n*Kan* is water; *dian* is lightning.\n*Peng hong* is the sound of their clash.\n\"Gold and water\" refers to the northwest.\n\"Fire erupts\" is pure yang ascending.\nKunlun is the mountain towering to heaven—\nThe realm of daily wandering.\nYin and yang: the Dao is called the interplay of one yin and one yang.\nThe \"two substances\" are the crow and hare.\n\"Returning to one place\" is the chamber of union.\n\"Medicine ripe, body fragrant\" is the effect of the Golden Elixir’s completion.\nWondrous! Marvelous!\nThis poem reveals the marrow of the Great Dao—\nAll is \"non-doing within doing,\"\nForm within the formless,\nNothing that is not the principle of spontaneity.\nLike the *Fulu* hexagram at midnight:\nIts trigram is *Kan*, and within *Kan* is lightning—\nFire arises within water,\nYin and yang clash, their sound like thunder.\nYet fire must blaze upward, its force erupting from Kunlun.\nThough Kunlun is lofty, it holds yin and yang.\nIf one can harmonize yin and yang,\nAnd return these two substances to one place,\nThe great medicine ripens naturally, and fragrance fills the body.\nThis is like jade in the mountains moistening the trees,\nOr pearls in the deep keeping the cliffs from withering.\n\nIf *Li* and *Kan* lack *wu* and *ji*,\nThough they contain the Four Images, no elixir forms.\nOnly because each holds true earth,\nCan the Golden Elixir return.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: *Kan* receives *wu* earth, *Li* receives *ji* earth.\n*Li* is fire, born of wood—\nWood is the Azure Dragon, fire the Vermilion Bird.\n*Kan* is water, born of metal—\nMetal is the White Tiger, water the Dark Warrior.\nThough *Li* and *Kan* are two trigrams,\nThey contain the Four Images.\nIf not paired with the earth of the central palace,\nWater and fire clash and cannot form the elixir.\nThe Four Images are water, fire, wood, and metal,\nBut the four celestial stems are *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.\nNorth *zi* is water, and *zi* holds the earthly branch *chou* (ox).\nSouth *wu* is fire, and *wu* holds *wei* (goat).\nEast *mao* is wood, and *mao* holds *yin* (tiger).\nWest *you* is metal, and *you* holds *xu* (dog).\nThus, each of the Four Images holds true earth,\nAnd only then can the Golden Elixir return.\nThis is the meaning of \"without *wu* and *ji*, no elixir forms.\"\n\nThe sun dwells in *Li*, yet is called female;\nThe moon pairs with *Kan*, yet is called male.\nIf you do not grasp this inversion,\nDo not presume to speak loftily of such matters.\nThe sun is yang, dwelling in the southern *Li* position at *wu*—\nIt should be male.\nYet it is called female, for *Li* is hollow within—\nYang containing yin.\nThe moon is yin, paired with the northern *Kan* at *zi*—\nIt should be female.\n\nNow it is called male, for *Kan* is full within—\nYin containing yang.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states: \"*Kan* holds the *wu* moon’s essence; *Li* grasps the *ji* sun’s radiance.\"\nWhen the moon of Great Yin receives the yang of *Kan*’s *wu* water and earth,\nIts brilliance shines forth.\nWhen the sun of Great Yang draws upon the yin of *Li*’s *ji* fire and earth,\nIts splendor is sustained.\nThis is the Dao of one yin and one yang,\nThe elixir of the Five Phases in inversion.\nSuch profound truths are subtle—\nWithout a master, none may comprehend.\nShould one’s understanding remain shallow,\nDiscourse on such matters is but empty talk.\n\nTake the solid core of *Kan*’s heart,\nAnd refine the yin within *Li*’s belly.\nThus transformed into the firmness of *Qian*,\nAll concealment and flight lie within the heart’s command.\nThe secret of the hollow *Kan* and the replete *Li*—\nThis is not merely the mutual nourishment of water and fire, the intercourse of heart and kidney.\nIts meaning has been expounded in the chapter on inversion through *Li* and *Kan*.\nThe transformation into the firmness of *Qian* is likewise detailed in the treatise on the union of *Qian*’s family.\nHere, it shall not be reiterated.\nYet Master Pingshu further declares that \"all concealment and flight lie within the heart’s command,\"\nFor in the *Yijing*, the six lines of *Qian* form the image of six dragons—\nA hexagram of pure yang.\nThe first is concealment; the next, flight—\nAll governed by the heart’s application.\nSo too in the refinement of the Golden Elixir:\nFrom pure yin, one smelts pure yang,\nThus equaling the firmness of *Qian*’s body.\n\nThe *Zhen* dragon’s mercury emerges from *Li*’s palace;\nThe *Dui* tiger’s lead is born in *Kan*’s domain.\nThese two things arise as the child produces the mother—\nThe Five Phases must all enter the center.\nWood-fluid and metal-essence,\nSymbolized as dragon and tiger.\nEast *Zhen* and west *Dui*—\nThe ancestral hexagrams are *Kan* and *Li*.\nThe dragon’s mercury issues from *Li*’s palace—\nWood engenders fire.\nThe tiger’s lead is born in *Kan*’s palace—\nMetal engenders water.\nYet fire does not arise from emptiness—\nIt must rely on wood.\nWater does not exist from nothing—\nIt depends on metal.\nMetal and wood each lie concealed within water and fire—\nThe mother harbors the child’s embryo.\nThough the Five Phases cannot complete their transformation without earth,\nThus each flourishes in the four seasons for eighteen days,\nFulfilling the work of a year.\nMoreover, metal and wood are sundered by east and west;\nWater and fire stand apart in south and north.\nWere it not for the central palace’s virtue of earth to unite them,\nThey would stray far from the Dao.\nHence it is said:\n\"Though wood-fluid and metal-essence claim their names,\nThey meet earth and become three kin.\"\nAgain:\n\"*Li* embraces *ji* earth; *Kan* holds *wu* earth—\nWithout *wu* and *ji*, no elixir forms.\"\n\nThe red dragon and black tiger converge from west and east,\nThe Four Images intertwine within *wu* and *ji*.\n*Fu* and *Gou* naturally govern their movement—\nWho dares say the Golden Elixir cannot succeed?\nThe dragon is wood;\nThe tiger is metal.\n\"Converge from west and east\"—\nMetal and wood must not be sundered.\nThe Four Images are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior.\n*Wu* and *ji* are the central palace’s earthly positions.\n\"Intertwine\"—the Four Images unite within the center.\nWithout *wu* and *ji*, no elixir forms.\n*Fu* is the birth of one yang;\n*Gou* is the birth of one yin.\nIf one can, at the inception of yin and yang’s ascent and descent,\nMaster their movement and harmonize with heaven and earth,\nThen how could the Golden Elixir be difficult?\nAs the Perfected of Yin declared: \"The utmost divine and sagely is most effortless.\"\n\nThe White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wild;\nThe Green Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and force them to battle—\nThey fuse into a lump of purple gold frost.\nThe west is *Dui*;\nThe mountain is earth.\nThe White Tiger is metal—\nEarth engenders metal, its image the tiger.\nThe east is *Zhen*;\nThe sea is water.\nThe Green Dragon is wood—\nWater engenders wood, its image the dragon.\nYet the metal tiger lies in the west, the wood dragon in the east—\nTheir forces are divided; how can this be the Dao?\nOne must seize these two beasts with both hands and force them into mortal combat,\nSo that the two qi intermingle and transform into a lump of gold frost.\nThough dragon and tiger are but metaphors, and \"both hands\" a figurative phrase,\nThey are not truly to be grasped.\nOne must firmly hold and preserve the spirit,\nTaming the wild and subduing the unyielding—\nThen the radiant Golden Elixir forms in an instant.\n\nOn Mount Hua’s peaks, the male tiger roars;\nIn Fusang’s depths, the female dragon sings.\nThe Yellow Dame herself acts as matchmaker,\nBidding them become husband and wife with one heart.\nMount Hua is the western mountain;\nThe male tiger is hard metal—\nThe image of earth engendering metal.\nFusang is the eastern sea;\nThe female dragon is soft wood—\nThe image of water engendering wood.\nEast and west stand apart in position;\nMetal and wood differ in nature—\nThey cannot unite as one.\nOnly when the Yellow Dame’s earth returns to the central palace,\nAnd she herself acts as matchmaker,\nCan metal and wood be brought together without separation.\nFirst raise the west, then join the east—\nThus the two things return to one place,\nLike husband and wife sharing one heart.\n\nWhen the moon at heaven’s edge is but a half-wheel bright,\nSoon the dragon’s cry and tiger’s roar resound.\nNow is the time to refine the two eights—\nWithin one double-hour, the elixir is complete.\nWhen the moon waxes, its po is full; when it wanes, its wheel is half—\nThis is the half-catty of metal at the first quarter.\nAt this moment, the seventh or eighth day,\nThe moon steals the sun’s yang hun, and its light gradually grows—\nSoon the images of dragon’s cry and tiger’s roar appear.\nThe dragon belongs to *Zhen*—*Zhen* is wood.\nThe tiger belongs to *Dui*—*Dui* is metal.\nMetal can engender water; wood can engender fire.\nMetal and wood clash; water and fire wage war.\n\nThus the dragon must cry and the tiger must roar—\nNow is the time to refine the two eights,\nAnd the elixir will surely be achieved.\n\nWhat are the two eights?\nNot the two gates of *mao* and *you*,\nNor the numerical weight of two eights making one catty.\nRather, it is the union of two and eight,\nWhose sum is ten—\nThe great number of Heaven and Earth’s creation,\nThe summation of the Five Phases’ generation.\n\nThus Heaven-one engenders water, Earth-six completes it.\nEarth-two engenders fire, Heaven-seven completes it.\nHeaven-three engenders wood, Earth-eight completes it.\nEarth-four engenders metal, Heaven-nine completes it.\nHeaven-five engenders earth, Earth-ten completes it.\nThese numbers—Heaven-one and Earth-two,\nHeaven-three and Earth-four,\nHeaven-five and Earth-six,\nHeaven-seven and Earth-eight,\nHeaven-nine and Earth-ten—\nEncompass the eternal warp of Heaven and Earth,\nGather the creative transformations of the Five Phases.\n\nFor those who cultivate the Dao, to grasp this profound mystery\nIs to achieve the elixir’s image in but a moment’s work,\nTo see the True Person manifest—\nWhat difficulty remains in the completion of the golden elixir?\nThus within one double-hour, the elixir is complete.\n\n*Commentary on the* Wuzhen Pian *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll Three, Concluded*\n*Commentary on the* Wuzhen Pian *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll Four*\n\nThe Cloud-Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia writes:\n\nFirst observe Heaven to discern the Five Thieves,\nThen examine Earth to pacify the people.\nWhen the people are at peace and the state is prosperous, seek the art of war;\nOnly through victory in war can the Sage be seen.\n\nThe discourse on victory in war pertains to the Way of military strategy.\nYet the mystery of cultivating the True—this is the Way of ascending as an immortal.\nPingshu [Zhang Boduan] conflates the two as one;\nWill later students not develop misguided views?\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Heaven has Five Thieves; those who perceive them prosper.\"\nThese Five Thieves are: metal overcoming wood, wood overcoming earth,\nEarth overcoming water, water overcoming fire, fire overcoming metal—\nThe Five Phases mutually overcoming one another to complete the Great Dao.\nOne must gaze upward to Heaven to comprehend the subtlety of this Way,\nThen look downward to Earth to pacify the multitudes of the people.\n\nWhat are the people?\nThe scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are the people of the world,\nWhile the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys are the people of one’s body.\nThe state is like one’s body,\nAnd Earth is like the positions of the five viscera.\nIf one’s faculties are clear and unobstructed, sight and hearing unimpeded,\nThe five organs harmonious, with inner and outer nourishment in balance,\nThen the body is at peace, the universe settled, and radiance emerges—\nThus the people are at peace, and the state is prosperous.\n\nOne must then seek the merit of victory in war,\nYet this does not mean brandishing weapons to engage the enemy,\nNor does it mean recklessly provoking conflict as a lesser defense.\nWhen yin doubts yang, they must battle, and their blood becomes dark and yellow.\nWithin the human body, yin and yang wage war day and night;\nOnly the Sage can ensure yang prevails over yin, unshaken by yin’s perverse influences.\nThis is the art of enriching the state and strengthening the army—\nWho but the Sage can achieve this?\n\nWhen deploying generals, divide them into left and right armies;\nLet the other be the host while I am the guest.\nI urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy,\nLest you lose the priceless treasure of our house.\n\nThis poem requires scholars to maintain a mind free of perversity before they can truly perceive its meaning.\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is formed through the mutual interaction of yin and yang qi.\nOne left, one right; one guest, one host—\nYet there is also the image of facing battle. Why?\nFor when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises.\nWhen yin doubts yang, they must battle, and their blood becomes dark and yellow—\nThus one must employ generals to command the left and right armies.\n\nWhat is the general? It is the rectified heart-mind.\n\"Let the other be the host while I am the guest.\"\nWhat is the host? It is the moment when the first yang stirs.\nWhat is the guest? It is responding to that movement.\nOnce I respond, there is inevitably an act of confrontation.\nI witness thunder roaring and lightning flashing, tigers leaping and dragons soaring,\nMerging in a whirlwind, cutting off all profit from a single source,\nDeploying forces ten thousandfold—thus the Golden Elixir achieves its work.\nOtherwise, if movement and stillness are ill-timed, if one advances recklessly,\nThen the great yang will scatter its pearls, its nature fierce and violent,\nAnd the primordial qi will flee—\nIs this not the loss of our house’s priceless treasure?\n\nFire is born from wood, its edge concealed;\nWithout skillful drilling, do not forcefully attack.\nDisaster arises from this self-harm—\nOne must subdue it to find the Metal Elder.\n\nWood can generate fire, yet fire hides within wood and does not reveal itself.\nWithin the human body, there is fire, concealed and unknown even to oneself.\nOnly those adept at drilling can seize the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nThus, by drilling tinder to change fire, the fire does not depend on blowing but on the work of drilling.\nBy burning the body to kindle fire, the fire does not rely on external aid but on the Way of cultivation.\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Fire is born from wood; disaster arises and must be overcome.\"\nWood is consumed by fire and burns itself; humans are harmed by their own fire.\nOnly the Sage can subdue this fire, controlling it from its origin—\nThus finding the Metal Elder to overcome wood.\nMoreover, metal can generate water, and water can overcome fire.\nIn this way, wood and fire are no longer our disasters but become our blessings—\nIs this not the Way of skillful drilling?\n\nThe Metal Elder is originally the son of the Eastern House,\nSent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow.\nIf you recognize and call him back to his dwelling for nurture,\nPair him with the Maiden of Cinnabar in intimate union.\n\nMetal is born in the *si* womb and nurtured in the *mao* [East],\nFor *mao* belongs to the East—thus metal is the son of the Eastern House.\nMetal is tempered in the *you* [West],\nAnd *you* is the West—thus metal lodges in the Western Neighbor.\nThough East and West differ in position, metal and wood must unite.\nThe qi flows back and forth, fundamentally no different—\nLike an infant and the Maiden of Cinnabar forming an intimate bond,\nWhat separation remains between the Eastern House and the Western Neighbor?\nThe two ultimately return to one place to complete the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the Way of the Golden Elixir—profound beyond profundity, wondrous beyond wonder.\n\nThe Maiden of Cinnabar roams with her own direction:\nHer forward path must be short, her rearward path long.\nWhen she returns, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nTo wed the Metal Elder as her old husband.\n\nThe Maiden of Cinnabar is the Great Yin,\nThe Great Yin is the lunar essence.\nThe lunar essence roams with its own direction.\nThe *Longhu Jing* states: \"On the third day, the moon emerges in the *geng* West, dividing at *mao* and *you*.\"\nFor *geng* is metal, and the moon is water—\nThis is the image of metal generating water.\n*Geng* belongs to the West;\nEvery third evening, the sun first sets in the *you* of the West,\nWhile the moon follows, born in the *geng*.\nThus the sun’s path is ahead, while the moon’s path is behind.\nAhead, the light and shadow must be short;\nBehind, the light and shadow gradually lengthen.\nShort means the solar essence has sunk;\nLong means the lunar essence gradually fills.\nWhether short or long, day and night depend on one another\nTo complete the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nOnly with the Yellow Dame of the Central Palace\nCan the Metal Elder be wed as her old husband.\nFor the Yellow Dame is earth, and earth can generate metal.\nEarlier, metal could generate water,\nAnd thus the lunar essence of the Maiden of Cinnabar begins to wax.\n\nNow again, earth can generate metal, its creative transformations boundless—thus the Metal Elder is called the Old Husband. As the *Cantong Qi* says, \"Lofty and revered is he.\"\n\nThough one may recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the firing times, it is as idle as nothing. In all things, cultivation’s power is paramount; the slightest deviation will fail to produce the elixir.\n\nThe Great Way of the Golden Elixir involves nothing more than lead and mercury. Lead arises in the North, the true essence of Heaven’s One generating water. Mercury emerges in the South, the wondrous work of Earth’s Two generating fire. Most true, most wondrous—no external borrowing, only the original face, which the common folk use daily yet do not recognize.\n\nIt is not the heart and kidneys, not *kan* and *li*, not the water and fire of the human realm, not common lead or common mercury. If one is blessed with innate spiritual bones, grasps the meaning through texts, and pierces the nature of cinnabar and lead, one has already obtained the ingredients for the Golden Elixir. Yet how can this medicine, so numinous, be refined? For example, lead, tin, and quicksilver flee at the sight of fire—how then can the elixir be formed?\n\nWithout knowing the firing times, even recognizing cinnabar and lead is of no benefit. For fire is fire, and timing is timing—scholars who conflate the two err. Speaking of external alchemy, there is civil fire and martial fire, inserted fire and lodged fire, celestial fire and the fires of the four cardinal directions, the fire of *jiji* and the fire of *weiji*—no different from the fires of internal alchemy.\n\nFive days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*, seventy-two *hou* make a year—this is the timing of a full year. From *hai* to *zi* is the yin crossing into yang; from *si* to *wu* is the yang crossing into yin—this is the timing of a single day. When *zi* and *chou* meet, it is the yang crossing into yin; when *chou* and *yin* meet, it is the yin crossing into yang—this is the timing of a single hour. No different from the timing of internal alchemy.\n\nThus Pengzu said: Though the world may recognize the true nature of cinnabar and lead, they have merely obtained the ingredients for the Golden Elixir. Without understanding the secret of firing times, it is all in vain. One must cultivate with utmost sincerity, without the slightest misstep in timing—only then will the Golden Elixir be achieved. Otherwise, blind practice and reckless refinement, lacking proper transmission, will lead even the smallest error to distance one from the Golden Elixir.\n\nThe sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; they do not commit the firing times to writing. As the *Cantong Qi* and other elixir scriptures, songs, and poems expound the truth in exhaustive detail, yet the matter of firing times is never plainly stated in the texts—one must encounter a true master for oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction to attain it once and for all. The supreme Way is not complex, yet fire is fire, and timing is timing—how can the world, in its ignorance, comprehend?\n\nThough fire and timing are two matters, they share a single principle. Though a single principle, they serve two functions. Without the oral instructions, how can one penetrate the mystery? Even if your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true teacher, do not presume to guess—thus one must discuss it in detail with the immortals.\n\nOn the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—\nThis is precisely when the metal essence is at its peak.\nWhen the first yang stirs in revival,\nBegin the firing without delay.\n\nThe fifteenth of the eighth month marks the midpoint of autumn, when the metal qi is at its height, corresponding to the *dui* trigram. Practitioners of the truth must pay heed at this time. When the first yang revives, the trigram becomes *fu*, the time of the winter solstice—then one must apply effort and begin the firing, without procrastination, lest the moment be lost.\n\nThough Pengzu used this metaphor to illustrate the principle of metal generating water, it does not mean one must wait for the eighth and eleventh months each year to refine the elixir, while the rest of the months are unusable—this is not the case. For within a single day, there is the autumnal peak of metal essence and the winter solstice of yang’s revival. Moreover, yang is born in *kan*, which belongs to water. How can water generate itself? It must be generated by metal. Metal reaches its imperial vigor in *you*—the eighth month. Water reaches its imperial vigor in *zi*—the eleventh month. This is the gathering of years into months, months into days, and days into hours.\n\nWhen the first yang stirs at the time of elixir-making,\nThe lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the curtains.\nAt the moment of receiving qi, it is easily obtained—\nBut in the work of drawing and adding, beware of danger.\n\nThe human body shares the same yin and yang as heaven and earth, with yang qi ascending daily from midnight at the *zi* hour and yin qi descending from noon at the *wu* hour. Those who cultivate the truth must activate the celestial mechanism at this time, aligning it precisely—without the slightest deviation, the Way of the Elixir will be achieved.\n\nThe \"lead cauldron\" is the vessel for refining the elixir within the human body. The \"curtains\" refer to the principle of sealing the *dui* trigram and lowering the veil, as well as Lü Dongbin’s light penetrating the curtains. Thus Pengzu cited these to say: when the first yang arises at the *zi* hour, it is the beginning of receiving qi, the time to make the elixir. If one misses this moment, there will be peril to guard against.\n\nFor when lead appears and *gui* water arises, one must swiftly gather it—if gold meets the full moon’s distance, it becomes unfit for tasting.\n\nThe Mysterious Pearl takes form as yang is born; when yang reaches its peak, yin’s essence gradually strips away its shape. By the tenth month, frost flies and the elixir ripens—at this moment, when taken into the mouth, even ghosts and spirits are startled.\n\nThat which grows loftier the more one looks up, harder the more one drills, appears before the eyes yet suddenly behind—this is the Confucian Mysterious Pearl taking form. Round and luminous, radiant and bright, clear and vivid, lively and fluid—this is the Buddhist Mysterious Pearl taking form. The numinous luminous treasury, illuminating heaven and earth, a single point of true suchness, the empty chamber generating brightness—this is the Daoist Mysterious Pearl taking form.\n\nThough the Three Teachings differ, the Great Dao is one. Yet the Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth; the Yellow Emperor’s lost pearl was grasped by the formless. Now it is said the Mysterious Pearl has form—why? Because the Great Dao enters existence from non-being, its form naturally manifests. Thus the image of a single wheel appearing in the deep pool is this form. The True Person emerging of itself is also this form. Called the Mysterious Pearl or Golden Elixir, these are all forms within form, arriving without seeking.\n\nProfound indeed, wondrous indeed—this form can be and not be, can conceal and reveal. When yang begins to rise, the Mysterious Pearl takes form; when the time of yin’s birth arrives, the Mysterious Pearl loses form. Thus it appears at the inception of yang’s peak and vanishes after yin’s extremity. In the *Fu* hexagram, the first yang is born at *zi*, and the Mysterious Pearl takes form. In the *Bo* hexagram, the six yins reach their extreme at *hai*, and the Mysterious Pearl loses form.\n\nYet only after ten months does the elixir ripen—this is the time when frost flies in biting cold, when the myriad things return to their roots and renew their lives, when yin reaches its limit and yang is born, when the celestial cycle is complete. Only then does the elixir congeal. Thus it is as large as a tangerine, as sweet as honey, the exchanged pear, the fiery jujube—swallowed or spat out like a dragon’s chin pearl, like the ox’s yellow. Lü Dongbin spoke of drinking the *daogui* at that time, for then one’s virtue commands the reverence of ghosts and spirits—how could it not astonish them when taken into the mouth?\n\nAfter the first crescent and before the last, the medicine’s flavor is mild and its qi complete. Gather it and return to refine it in the furnace; once tempered, nurture it through gentle warming and self-cultivation.\n\nThe first crescent refers to the waxing moon of the seventh or eighth day of the lunar month. The last crescent refers to the waning moon of the twenty-second or twenty-third day. What is meant by \"crescent\"? When the moon first waxes or begins to wane, its shape is half, like the drawn bow of the upper string. At this time, the elixir’s essence is clear and pure, the golden essence robust and flourishing, its flavor mild, and its qi fully manifested. Those who cultivate the Dao must emulate the heavens and model their forms, gathering the golden and watery qi of their own bodies to refine in the spiritual furnace. Through the regulation of fire and the addition or withdrawal of heat, they nurture and temper it, neither losing the balance of water and fire. Thus the golden elixir is achieved—what else need one seek?\n\nThe eldest son first drinks the wine of the West,\nThe youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North.\nIf the Green Maiden meets them thereafter,\nAll will be sealed within the Yellow House.\n\nThe eldest son is *Zhen* (☳). The youngest daughter is *Dui* (☱). *Zhen* pertains to wood, *Dui* to metal. The \"wine of the West\" refers to the West as the direction of metal, and wine as the symbol of water—an analogy for metal giving birth to water. The \"flower of the North\" refers to the North as the direction of *Kan* water, and the flower as the bloom of lead—an analogy for lead within water. The \"Green Maiden\" is the green maiden, the wood-mercury. The \"Yellow House\" is the Yellow Dame, the central palace. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Cinnabar is the essence of wood; only when it meets metal do they unite.\" The great Dao takes mutual restraint as its subtlety; metal and wood must not be allowed to separate. If not sealed within the central palace, *Zhen* in the East and *Dui* in the West would have no means of transformation. For wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness, and metal’s essence yearns for wood’s benevolence. Only through mutual absorption and consumption do they become intimate, necessarily borrowing the central palace’s earth to complete the work of creation.\n\nWhen the months of the Hare and the Rooster arrive at their time,\nPunishment and virtue stand at the gate, mirroring the medicine’s form.\nAt this point, the golden cinnabar must be bathed;\nIf fire is added further, peril and collapse will follow.\n\nThings at their extreme must reverse—this is the principle and the natural tendency. Thus, in *Qian*’s topmost yang line, the pure yang reaches its limit, and the sage warns of the \"arrogant dragon’s regret.\" Moreover, metal is born in *Si* (☶) and flourishes in *You* (☰). Wood is born in *Hai* (☳) and flourishes in *Mao* (☷). The Hare is *Mao*’s wood; the Rooster is *You*’s metal. Metal governs punishment; wood governs virtue. \"Punishment and virtue stand at the gate\" refers to *Mao* and *You* as the gates of the second and eighth months, the paths of the sun and moon’s entry and exit, the division of yin and yang, day and night. Since the great Dao takes yin and yang, the sun and moon as its foundation, when it reaches the places of *Mao* and *You*’s extreme flourishing, one must bathe, concentrating the qi to achieve softness, acting without striving, and embracing tranquility. Thus the harmonious primordial yang fills the space between heaven and earth, and this heart has no outward attachment, naturally merging with the Great Void. As it is said: \"When the hundred bones are all governed by true non-action, one must not add scorching fire, lest the medicine escape and peril ensue.\" This is precisely the principle of regulating fire to prevent danger.\n\nThe sun and moon meet once every thirty days,\nExchanging days for hours, the method of divine work.\nDefending the city or waging wild battle, know fortune and misfortune;\nAdding numinous cinnabar, the cauldron fills with red.\n\nHeaven and earth rely on the sun and moon for their work, illuminating the myriad forms without cease, day and night. They must meet at the new moon every thirty days, cycling endlessly without termination. The great Dao employs the golden elixir, refining the crow and smelting the hare, subduing the dragon and taming the tiger. Emulating heaven and modeling its forms, it exchanges hours for days to seize the creative power of heaven and earth, just as the sun and moon unite as one. Thus one attains longevity and avoids death. Yet gathering years into months, months into days, and days into hours, one must firmly guard the city walls, battle and repel demonic obstacles, refrain from idle thoughts, and remain unmoved by desire. Naturally, fortune will come without misfortune. For victory brings fortune, and defeat brings misfortune; fortune brings life, and misfortune brings death. If every battle is won, fortune will be everlasting, and misfortune will vanish. Thus the priceless treasure resides within one’s own body. Like nine-times-refined numinous cinnabar, accumulated day by day and month by month, its red light will penetrate through, moving heaven and earth and startling ghosts and spirits.\n\nWhen *Pi* and *Tai* first meet, the myriad things flourish;\n*Zhun* and *Meng* receive their hexagrams, endowed with life and completion.\nWithin this, grasp the meaning and do not seek images;\nIf you exhaust the lines, you will be enslaved by toil.\n\nWhen heaven and earth unite, it is *Tai*; when they do not, it is *Pi*. The meaning of *Tai* is the image of *Jiji* and *Weiji*. *Zhun* (Water Thunder) teaches the noble one to order and weave; the spring beneath the mountain is *Meng*, teaching the noble one to act resolutely and cultivate virtue. The meanings of *Zhun* and *Meng* represent the initial growth of yin and yang, the very time for cultivating the true and nurturing the essence. Yet those who seek the golden elixir are confused by the regulation of fire, bewildered by the timing of the furnace, and thus apply the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines as their method, wasting years in vain labor, their hair turning white without achievement. Thus Master Pingshu said: \"When heaven and earth first unite, the myriad things flourish. At the initial arising of *Zhun* and *Meng*, one must preserve and nurture the primordial spirit, just as in the time of *Zhun*’s difficulties and *Meng*’s youth, not allowing the slightest external use of the mind. Naturally, one advances in the Dao, and the myriad things of heaven and earth are all contained within the self. How can this not be fulfilling? Why cling to images and numbers, only to be enslaved by the lines?\"\n\nHexagrams set forth images to model forms,\nGrasp the meaning, forget the words, and the intent will be clear.\nLater generations, deluded, cling only to images,\nPracticing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending in flight.\n\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate divided, there was a thing formed in chaos—what hexagram image could there be? Only after heaven and earth separated and *Qian* and *Kun* were established did the sages set forth images and draw hexagrams, merely using the sun and moon as the *Yi*. Its purport is profound and subtle; the great Dao lies herein. Yet later scholars, not understanding, cling only to images and practice hexagram qi, using *Zhun* in the morning and *Meng* at night, *Xu* in the morning and *Song* at dusk, dividing the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines into thirty days, while *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are left unused. Or, in twenty-nine days, they employ other methods to supplement the hexagrams.\n\nSuch practices are truly absurd and self-inflicted toil. How can one employ the hexagram *Zhun* (Water-Thunder) in the morning and claim its efficacy when its image is *Zhun*? How can one employ *Meng* (Mountain-Water) at night and claim its efficacy when its image is *Meng*? As for *Xu* (Water-Heaven) and *Song* (Heaven-Water), what method or standard exists to embody their forms? Yet deluded fools lead one another astray, corrupting the great Dao, and still hope to ascend in flight—how utterly foolish and misguided!\n\nHeaven and earth wax and wane in their own time; only by discerning their ebb and flow can one grasp the subtle mechanism. Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* days have enforced the celestial decree, and when the Three Worms are slain, the Dao may be attained. Though heaven and earth are vast, the Dao has its waxing and waning. The great Dao is profound and subtle, its mechanism linked to ebb and flow—this is no mere delusion or idle fantasy.\n\nThe human body mirrors heaven and earth; every principle of waxing and waning, ebb and flow, is no different from that of heaven. Thus, at midnight, yang begins to rise; after noon, yin descends. The *geng* precedes the *jia*, their commands strict and clear, so that clarity and brightness reside within, and the spirit’s resolve is as divine. Yet the Three Worms and yin demons disrupt one’s true nature, disorder the blood and qi, and invert deluded thoughts—what place does the Dao have in this? Only by returning from the perverse to the upright, enforcing the *geng* and *jia*, and ensuring the timely interaction of metal and wood, can one grasp the subtle mechanism of ebb and flow, respond to the natural in silence, and slay the Three Worms—then the Dao may be attained.\n\nTo keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation. Once yang essence returns to the Golden Chamber, a single luminous pearl will forever illumine the six directions, merging with heaven and earth as one.\n\nThe Most High said: \"The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female.\" The *Spiritual Pivot* states: \"The spirit of the empty valley, when guarded, remains true.\" For the valley is utter emptiness, and the spirit is utmost numinosity. Emptiness enables perfect responsiveness; numinosity enables transformation. This is the way of long life and enduring vision—hence it is called the Valley Spirit, the Spirit Chamber, the Numinous Treasure Repository, the Crystal Palace, the Primordial Yang Temple, or the Great Unity Crucible, all of which are the sites of golden elixir refinement.\n\nYet the Dao is called the interplay of yin and yang, and the elixir is called the union of the Mysterious and the Female. Before the Primordial Chaos divided, there was a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Once the Supreme Ultimate separated, the Two Modes took their places, and the Mysterious Female was established. Now, to keep the Valley Spirit undying and achieve long life and enduring vision, one must rely on the Mysterious and the Female as the foundation, refining and tempering daily, so that yin evil is consumed and yang essence alone remains whole, returning to the Golden Chamber in the Central Palace. Then a single luminous pearl will radiate through the six directions, completing the union with heaven and earth.\n\nThe gateway of the Mysterious Female is rarely known; do not mistakenly apply it to the mouth and nose. Though you may practice breath regulation for a thousand years, how can you seize the Golden Crow and the Jade Hare?\n\nThe Most High said: \"The gateway of the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth.\" Its meaning is profoundly subtle—how could ordinary people easily comprehend it? Precisely because it is rarely known, some take the nose as the Heavenly Gate, calling it the Mysterious, and the mouth as the Earthly Door, calling it the Female. They exhale the old and inhale the new, taking in more and expelling less, ceaselessly day and night, believing this is the way to attain the Dao. Yet this is merely a method of guiding qi for ease and comfort. Even if practiced for a thousand years, what does it have to do with the great Dao of the golden elixir? Only by causing the Golden Crow and Jade Hare to dance at the gateway of the Mysterious Female, returning to the origin of yin and yang, merging the Two Modes into one, and restoring primordial simplicity, can the sun and moon unite to form the elixir—this is what is meant by \"joining virtue with heaven and earth, merging brightness with the sun and moon.\"\n\nDifferent names emerge from the same source, yet few know that these two are the subtlest of mechanisms. Preserve nature and complete form by understanding waxing and waning; the Purple Gold True Medicine is wondrous indeed. The Dao is called the interplay of yin and yang, and the elixir is called the union of lead and mercury. Though their names differ, their essence is the same. Their number is two, but their body is one. Few know this, so they fail to grasp the subtlety within subtlety, the mechanism within the essential. If one truly understands, then preserving nature and completing form, clarifying the principles of waxing and waning—what is the tally of fire’s retreat? What is the marker of fire’s advance? Each retreat and advance mirrors the waxing and waning of heaven and earth. When the qi and markers of waxing and waning are unerring, the medicine becomes wondrous beyond imagination. This is called the Purple Gold Elixir, the Numinous Treasure Repository.\n\nAt first, when effort is made, few perceive it; only when it becomes effortless do the many recognize it. Yet they see only effortlessness as the essential marvel, unaware that effort is the foundation. The great Dao is effortless, fundamentally the wonder of spontaneity. Heaven says nothing, yet the four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born—such is its principle. How much more so the profound mystery of the golden elixir, which cannot be sought through intellect or force, nor grasped through form or substance. If called \"being,\" it cannot be met when pursued, nor seen when followed. If called \"non-being,\" it is dim and indistinct, yet within it lies something; it is obscure and profound, yet within it lies essence. Thus, when effort is made, few perceive it, but when it becomes effortless, the many recognize it. This creates a distinction between superior and inferior, with effortlessness deemed the essential marvel. Yet how can they know that effortlessness is the fundamental nature of the Dao, while effort is its foundation? This is not to say that clinging to images and texts, or toiling like a well-sweep, constitutes effort. Nor is it to say that sitting in solitary stillness, like withered wood or dead ashes, constitutes effortlessness.\n\nThe highest good is like water, flowing where there is no strife. The supreme Dao is unburdensome, attaining what is inherently possessed. Effortlessness rests in spontaneity, while effort also proceeds spontaneously.\n\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Four Concludes*\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Five*\n\nCloud Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia writes:\n\nWithin black resides white as the Elixir Mother,\nThe masculine embracing the feminine forms the Sacred Embryo.\nWhen the Great One is guarded within the furnace with utmost care,\nThe treasures of the Three Fields gather, corresponding to the Three Terraces.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"Know the white, guard the black, and numinous clarity will come of itself.\"\nThe *Baopuzi* states: \"Guard the feminine, embrace the One, concentrate the qi to attain suppleness—this is the Elixir Mother and Sacred Embryo.\"\n\nYet while the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir indeed relies on the mutual support of black and white, the interdependence of feminine and masculine, to achieve the work of the Elixir Mother and Sacred Embryo,\none must know that the primordial qi containing true essence and the treasures gathered in the Three Fields must not be the least bit deficient.\nThus, when treasures gather in the Three Fields and the furnace guards the Great One,\nwhen essence, qi, and spirit are complete and the firing times unerring,\nnaturally the Sacred Embryo may be formed, the Elixir Mother accomplished,\nupward corresponding to the image of the Three Terraces, replete and radiant with light.\n\nWithin the elusive and indistinct, an image may be found;\nthe profound and unfathomable is true essence.\nFrom this, being and non-being mutually enter—\nhow could one conceive of it before witnessing it?\n\nGazing, one sees not its color; listening, one hears not its sound; grasping, one cannot seize its form—such is the state of the elusive and indistinct, the profound and unfathomable. What has this to do with the Dao?\n\nYet within the formless, there is form; within the shapeless, there is shape. From emptiness and fullness, the white emerges; from non-being, being arises. If it is empty, whence comes the white? If it is nothing, whence comes being? This is the mystery within mystery, the wonder within wonder. Without attainment through practice or verification through effect, one cannot speak of it.\n\nOnly within the elusive and indistinct, the profound and unfathomable, may one perceive the image of true essence; only within the neither-having-nor-not-having may one see the principle of mutual entry. Then the Dao is within me. If one has not yet seen this, then mere side doors and minor methods—vain imaginings—how can they lead to accomplishment?\n\nWhen the Four Symbols meet, the mysterious body is achieved;\nwhen the Five Directions move, the purple light shines bright.\nShedding the embryo and entering the mouth, the body attains sagehood,\nand countless dragons and spirits are all struck with awe.\n\nThe Four Symbols are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior. The Five Directions are east, west, south, north, and center—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The Great Dao is empty and without form, yet the Golden Elixir is its profound mystery. Though the Golden Elixir is wondrous, it is nothing more than the gathering of the Five Phases and the harmonizing of the Four Symbols. When the Four Symbols unite, the mysterious body is again achieved; when the Five Directions converge, the elixir’s light shines resplendent.\n\nThis is not a matter of imagining the heart’s fire or the kidneys’ water, nor of taking the liver as the dragon or the lungs as the tiger. Heaven generates all beings, and humans are born with numinous treasures—the Five Phases gather here, the Four Symbols assemble here. If one practices the mysterious mechanism, then the Great Medicine is refined, the embryo shed and taken into the mouth, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood. Countless dragons and spirits all rise in reverence and awe—how could they not be utterly astonished? This is the Dao so lofty that dragons and tigers submit, virtue so weighty that ghosts and spirits revere it.\n\nWhen the swallows of the Flowery Pond depart, the moon’s radiance is clear;\nriding a golden dragon, one visits the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the host of immortals,\nthe tides of the sea and the shifting of valleys may change as they will.\n\nThe arts of the Golden Elixir, though numbered in the hundreds, hinge upon the divine water and the Flowery Pond. The Flowery Pond is the crucible for refining the elixir, within which divine water flows ceaselessly, day and night. If one obtains this and swallows it, then the moon’s brilliance congeals. This is what the Confucians mean by \"uniting brightness with the sun and moon,\" and what the Buddhists describe as \"perfectly round, luminous, and radiant.\"\n\nMetal is the White Tiger of the west; wood is the Azure Dragon of the east. Now, if one can cultivate the true and ride this golden dragon, then metal and wood will not be separated by decree. One may ascend to the Lord on High, release the primordial spirit—is this not visiting the Purple Tenuity? If one attains this Dao, then one ascends as an immortal, transcending life. Though the seas turn to mulberry fields, what has this to do with me? Thus, one may freely abide amid the shifting of valleys.\n\nKnow that the method of refining and nurturing the Returned Elixir\nshould be to plant the seed in one’s own garden.\nNo need for forced effort or laborious puffing—\nnaturally, the fruit ripens and the true embryo is shed.\n\nHumans receive the numinous qi of yin and yang, and thus possess the measure of a full catty of the Great Elixir. If it is not dissipated, one may endure with heaven and earth. Yet the six desires and seven emotions sever one’s celestial authenticity, so that one cannot be certain of the morrow. The supreme sages, in their compassion, bequeathed the method of the Returned Elixir, teaching one to refine and nurture it to exhaust the wonders of the nine returns and seven reversions. This is not something borrowed from the substance of plants or the artifice of humans—it is all a matter of seeking within oneself.\n\nThus, take the four great elements and the body as one’s garden, yin and yang qi as the seeds. Morning planting, evening harvest; spring growth, autumn withering; flowering, fruiting, the ripening of the fruit, the rounding of the embryo—all occurs in accordance with the natural seasons, in harmony with heaven and earth. There is no need to rely on forced effort or laborious puffing, nor to exhaust oneself with external affairs.\n\nCease all clever artifice and contrived effort;\nrecognize the deathless method of another’s house.\nIn the pot, the life-sustaining wine is ever replenished;\nin the tripod, the soul-returning nectar is gathered.\n\nCultivating virtue brings ease to the heart and daily renewal; contrivance wearies the mind and leads to daily decline. Those who practice the Dao take the true and constant as their heart, uprightness as their thought—thus they turn from perversity to rectitude, emerge from death and enter life. If one resorts to artifice, the heart becomes crooked and thoughts inverted, deluded imaginings arise, and one dwells ever nearer to death.\n\nThough the division between life and death lies in the distinction between truth and falsehood, how then is this attained? Only by ever replenishing the life-sustaining wine within the pot, gathering the soul-returning nectar within the tripod, never allowing the true primordial essence to be depleted or the fundamental power to be exhausted. Like a lamp with oil, like a tree with roots, naturally its radiance shines forth, its branches and leaves flourish abundantly—this is indeed the method of deathlessness, how could it deceive?\n\nOn Snow Mountain, a single taste of fine *tiguhu*;\npoured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of transformation.\nShould one journey to Kunlun’s northwest,\nZhang Qian would first meet Magu.\n\nThis employs imagery as allegory, speaking of the Snow Mountain within the human body that yields the precious flavor of *tiguhu*. The mountain pertains to earth, which generates metal; metal’s qi is cold, hence it is called Snow Mountain. Yet metal is born of earth, its fluid flows forth, sweet in taste and white in hue, resembling *tiguhu*. Only when poured into the Eastern Sun’s furnace—where Eastern Sun pertains to the wood of *jia* and *yi*, and wood contains fire, which can overcome metal—does it become a work of creation. This transformative mystery is profound, beyond the ken of ordinary beings.\n\nIf, atop Kunlun’s peak, one encounters the northwest’s metal and water positions, allowing them to generate and restrain one another, seizing the creative power of heaven and earth, then yin and yang find their kindred, naturally uniting in resonance. Like Zhang Qian riding the countercurrent upstream, one may behold the immortal Magu. Zhang Qian represents the yang male; Magu, the yin female—this too is an allegory of union.\n\nNot knowing the yang essence and its host or guest,\nhow can one discern near from far?\nIn the chamber, vainly sealing the *weilü* cavity—\nhow many in Jambudvīpa have been thus misled!\n\nThe yang essence governs the hun and shen of the entire body—how could one recognize it? Moreover, there are host and guest, near and far, which require a master’s oral instructions to fathom. Otherwise, merely controlling the chamber and restraining essence by focusing on the *weilü* is mistaken.\n\nMaster Yunfang lamented:\n*\"Alas for the Three Peaks’ Yellow Valley Master—\nhow many in the Southern Continent have been misled!\"*\nThe Three Peaks refer to the art of yin elixirs, a method for preserving form and abiding in the world, not the Dao of immortals. Yet when people’s qi and blood are unsettled, facing circumstances they cannot forget their passions; though their hearts yearn for the Dao, desire is hard to suppress. Ancient immortals, in their compassion, among the three thousand six hundred gates, also taught methods of essence retention, so that people might understand the ceaseless transformations of life, taking essence, qi, and spirit as their foundation. To grasp them is to preserve; to abandon them is to perish. Applied to others, they can give life; retained within oneself, they can sustain one’s own life. This is no frivolous play, nor is it to be indulged wantonly.\n\nThough the sea is vast, it cannot fill a leaking vessel.\nIf the *weilü* is not sealed, how can one attain longevity?\nYet without a master’s transmission, many in Jambudvīpa have been misled.\n\nAll things flourish and each returns to its root;\nreturning to the root and reviving the mandate is constant abiding.\nKnowing the constant is the wondrous Dao—few comprehend it;\nreckless action often brings misfortune, as is often heard.\n\nThe *Daodejing* states: *\"All things flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reviving the mandate. Reviving the mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\"* Master Pingshu’s poem embodies this meaning.\n\nAll things arise from their nature and return to their nature—like blossoms and leaves that grow from the root and return to the root, like waves that arise from water and return to water. Once they return, stillness is attained and the mandate revived. Abiding in constancy without delusion, external falsehoods are wholly dispelled; profound stability radiates light, neither shifting with things nor vanishing with transformations. From its origin and its root, it endures unchanging.\n\nThus the *Zhun* hexagram of the *Yijing* says: *\"The sun and moon attain heaven and can shine long; the four seasons transform and can endure long. The sage abides long in the Dao, and the world is transformed and perfected.\"* The timeliness of *zhun* is truly great! How could ordinary people comprehend this?\n\nYet because it is difficult for people to grasp, they often act recklessly and invite misfortune, bringing turmoil upon themselves. Thus to \"violate the constant,\" \"alter the constant,\" or \"deviate from the constant\" brings misfortune, never fortune.\n\nOuye received the sword-forging method in person,\nmatching Ye Stream’s metal and water to temper hardness and softness.\nOnce refined, it understands its wielder’s intent—\na thousand miles away, it slays evil in a flash of lightning.\n\nOuyezhi, a rustic scholar of ancient times, forged swords worth a thousand gold—not by any other means, but by the mutual generation of metal and water, the harmonizing of hardness and softness, refined a hundred times to become unmatched in the world. As an analogy for the great Dao of the golden elixir, this is the method of forging swords. Speaking of the human body, in the land of Ye and Han there are the substances of metal and water, the functions of hardness and softness. If one obtains a master’s refining, its edge is irresistible. Naturally, it becomes luminously responsive, discerning things as they arise, perceiving affairs as they occur. Though evil and obstinacy may be a thousand miles away, they can be subdued beneath a flash of lightning. This clarity that sees a thousand miles, its cold radiance and true color, are all natural secondary effects.\n\nKnocking bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade fungus,\nstrumming the zither to call the phoenix to drink the *daogui* pellet.\nLately, golden light has suffused my body—\nI speak not of this mechanism to ordinary people.\n\nThis employs imagery as allegory, alluding to the substances within the human body. The bamboo and zither, when struck, produce sound; the turtle and phoenix share similar forms. The jade fungus and *daogui* pellet are alike—both born of harmonious qi, products of metal and earth.\n\nThough the names differ in six ways, their fundamental nature is but three. Speaking of the great Dao as non-action, it initially requires no deliberate effort; yet when tally and tally correspond, when qi and resonance align, within non-action there is action—responding to the mechanisms of heaven and earth, all through the Dao of natural resonance and union.\n\nThus, within the human body, a single substance: when struck like bamboo, the turtle may be summoned; when strummed like a zither, the phoenix may be called. All is resonance of sound and qi, response of breath and breath—swift as echo and shadow. When harmonious qi naturally brings forth auspiciousness, the jade fungus may be swallowed, the *daogui* pellet may be drunk. Its joints and vessels, its veins and textures, all flow unimpeded from top to bottom. Qi of the same kind summons one another, requiring no extra effort to manifest its efficacy.\n\nRightly so, golden light suffuses the body, present within and manifest without—like jade in the mountain that moistens the trees, like a pearl in the deep that keeps the cliffs from withering. Most profound, most wondrous—how could one speak of such mysteries to the vulgar?\n\nOnly when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form;\nthe Dao, in its rarity and stillness, accords with nature.\nA single grain of numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—\nthen one knows my fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nLike sounds resonate, like qi seeks its kind. The great medicine of the golden elixir arises from nothing but lead and mercury. Lead can transform mercury, and mercury in turn transforms lead. Seven returns, nine refinements—this is the external elixir.\n\nThat which cannot be seen is called *xi* (rare);\nthat which cannot be heard is called *yi* (still).\nThe great Dao of *xi* and *yi* emerges from nature—\nit is the Dao of clarity and quiescence, non-action: this is the internal elixir.\n\nWith the internal elixir to refine the spirit,\nthere must also be the external elixir to refine the form,\nso that both form and spirit attain wondrous union, merging with the true Dao.\nA single grain of elixir, numinous and wondrous in its workings,\nnaturally transcends the mortal to enter sagehood,\npasses from death into life—\nis this not \"my fate lies with me, not with heaven\"?\n\nThe radiant cinnabar elixir may be completed in a day—\nthe ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.\nIf one speaks of nine years or three years,\nit is all but procrastination and delay.\n\nThe great Dao of the golden elixir is the supreme vehicle to immortality—\nought it not be most difficult?\nYet Lü Dongbin (Pure Serenity) declared it could be achieved in a day—\nhow could this be so?\nHe also said: \"All comes down to a moment’s effort,\nyet it secures boundless ease and joy forever.\"\nThus we know Yin Zhenren’s words: \"The most divine and sagely is most effortless.\"\nBelieve these words, and the supreme Dao is not burdensome—\nit is no mere side path of many affairs.\nIn a moment, in a day, the Dao is perceived as present.\nTo speak of nine years or three is but to delay one’s own progress.\nThat which is grasped is preserved; that which is released is lost—\nwithout fixed time, without known direction—\nsuch is far from the Dao.\n\nYanzi’s feigned foolishness,\nZengzi’s single-minded \"yes,\"\nXiangyan’s striking of bamboo,\nShancai’s snapping of fingers—\neven Confucians and Buddhists strive for it.\nHow much more, then, to ascend to immortality from the common,\nto transcend the mortal and enter sagehood—\ncould this not be achieved in a day?\n\nThe great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—\nknow that it depends on fate, yet also on heaven.\nIf one has not accumulated deeds and bestowed hidden virtue,\nat every turn demonic obstacles arise to block the way.\n\nMan stands with heaven and earth as the Three Powers—\nwhy then do men often die young, while heaven and earth endure without end?\nThose who understand know:\none must cultivate the great Dao of the golden elixir,\nto match heaven and earth in their completion.\nIs this a trifling matter?\nThus, to cultivate the Dao of immortality,\none must first cultivate the Dao of man.\nIf one is ashamed in the Dao of man,\nthe Dao of immortality remains distant.\n\nWhat is the Dao of man?\nOnly to accumulate deeds to save others,\nto harbor hidden virtue in the world—\nlike heaven and earth’s all-covering and all-bearing, without a trace of selfishness;\nlike the Supreme Emperor’s love of life, without a thought of killing.\nThus, looking up, one feels no shame; looking down, one commits no wrong—\nthen heaven naturally protects, and all is auspicious.\nIf one cultivates the great medicine to seek immortality,\nthe Dao is most easy—all depends on oneself.\nBut if one feels shame in the hidden chamber,\ndeceives in the dark,\nthen demonic obstacles arise daily,\nand the path becomes most difficult.\nIndeed, it is not inherently difficult—\nit is that heaven cannot tolerate it.\nNot that heaven is at fault,\nbut that one lacks virtue to align with heaven’s heart.\nCan those who study the Dao not seek the easy and discard the difficult?\n\nThe Three Powers mutually consume in their time;\nthe *Dao* and *De*, the *Yinfu*, reveal the sacred mechanism.\nWhen the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,\nthe hundred bones are all ordered—proof of non-action.\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* says:\n\"Heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things;\nthe myriad things are the thieves of man;\nman is the thief of the myriad things.\"\nIt also says: \"Consume in their time, and the myriad transformations are at peace.\"\nThis has been explained in detail in the *Lecture on the Yinfu Jing*.\nYet Pure Serenity further expounds on the proof of non-action:\nthough the ceaseless transformations of generation and decay, waxing and waning,\nmay seem like many affairs,\nthe great Dao is impartial—\nnothing is not the principle of nature.\nIf one can fill oneself with this and put it to use,\nthe mind mirrors the great void, and all concerns naturally cease;\nqi embraces the primordial beginning, and the hundred bones harmonize.\nThe Dao of non-action may be realized in the immortal realm of the Great Clarity.\n\nThe precious words of the *Yinfu* exceed three hundred;\nthe numinous script of the *Daode* fills five thousand.\nImmortals past and present are without number—\nall have grasped the true meaning here.\n\nHow profound! The great Dao is hard to transmit,\nand does not rely on written words.\nYet jade tablets and golden oracles, divine chapters and precious scrolls,\nstand arrayed like a martial arsenal,\ncomplete as a comprehensive tortoise-shell divination.\nFrom what should the student of the Dao draw verification?\nOnly within the most complex lies the principle of utmost simplicity;\nwithin the most detailed, the use of utmost essentiality.\nIs it not that the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing*, with its words exceeding three hundred,\nand the Supreme Venerable One’s *Daode Jing*, with its text filling five thousand,\ncontain the profound subtleties of the great Dao, leaving nothing untouched?\nImmortals past and present who ascend to the golden towers,\nwho wander and feast in the jade capital,\nare beyond counting—\nyet all have grasped the true meaning of these two classics,\nattained their wondrous use.\nStudents must not ignore their essentials\nwhile seeking side paths among the three thousand six hundred.\n\nIt is like the hundred schools of thought, the miscellaneous records and commentaries—\nfilling houses, straining oxen—\ntheir number is beyond reckoning.\nYet the Dao of the Six Classics all returns to the simple principle of qian and kun.\nSo too the great Dao of the golden elixir does not exceed the two classics:\nthe *Yinfu* and the *Daode*.\n\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min’s,\nwithout meeting a true master, do not strain to guess.\nFor the elixir classics lack oral transmissions—\nwhere then can you conceive the numinous embryo?\n\nThe great Dao is one,\nyet its teachings divide into three.\nTrace them from the three,\nand a thousand gates, ten thousand doors unfold—\na thousand scriptures, ten thousand discourses,\ntheir limits beyond reckoning.\nYet follow the one to thread them all,\nand heaven gains its clarity,\nearth its tranquility,\nhumankind its life—\nthe supreme Dao is not complex.\n\nYet that their limits are beyond reckoning\nseems difficult, but is in truth easy.\nIf you possess a nature of keen intelligence and wisdom,\nyou may penetrate widely, master broadly,\nas if nothing remains untouched.\nOnly the principle that the supreme Dao is not complex—\nthough it seems easy, is in truth hard.\nEven with the talents of Yan and Min,\nyou may not awaken to it alone.\nYou must meet a sagely teacher, a perfected one,\nwho transmits the oral instructions,\npoints out the celestial mechanism—\nthen with a single word, the matter is grasped,\nin an instant, the work is done,\nthe numinous embryo may be conceived,\nand the great Dao attained.\n\nThe root-source is clear, the trigger lies in the square inch.\nWhen the three thousand deeds are complete, your merit equals heaven.\nNaturally, there is a crucible to refine dragon and tiger—\nwhy cling to home, yearn for wife and child?\n\nThe root-source is clear,\nthe trigger lies in the square inch.\nWhen the three thousand deeds are fulfilled,\nyour merit equals heaven.\nWhat is this square inch?\nIt is this heart.\nWhat is this equality with heaven?\nIt is also this heart.\nThe heart is the lord of heaven,\nsovereign over the ten thousand images.\nIf you are inwardly luminous, utterly unstained,\ncultivating the true and upholding the Dao,\nfulfilling the three thousand deeds—\nthough the heavenly Dao is profound and unfathomable,\nyou will stand before it without shame,\na companion to heaven.\nNaturally, there is a crucible to refine the golden elixir,\nwhere dragon coils and tiger crouches,\nthe dharmic image shines forth,\nits medicine boundless.\nWhy remain mired in the dust of the world,\ndeluded by love and attachment,\nburdened by family, bound to wife and children,\nto rot with the grasses and trees?\n\nBefore refining the returning elixir, refine it swiftly.\nOnce refined, know when to stop and be content.\nIf you cling to abundance with an insatiable heart,\nyou may yet one day meet ruin and disgrace.\n\nThe method of the returning elixir\nis the Dao of long life and enduring vision.\nHow can the worldly, bound to dust and custom,\nfathom its wonders?\nOnly those of immortal wind and Daoist bone\ncan know the method of cultivation.\nYet the medicine, the fire-timing,\nthe operations of withdrawal and addition—\nmust accord with heaven and earth.\nDo not know advance but not retreat,\nknow action but not cessation.\nThus, before refining the returning elixir,\nhasten to cultivate—\nas Master Lü said, “To begin swiftly is already too late.”\nOnce refined, guard it well,\ndo not recklessly add fire-timing.\nIf the fire-timing is amiss,\nthe sun’s flowing pearl—\nfierce and violent in nature—\nwill ever seek to leave you.\nOne day, it may spill and be lost,\nbringing ruin and disgrace.\nAs Zhongli said, “When the medicine is ripe,\ndo not apply fire-timing—\nto do so would harm the elixir.”\nFrom this, we see:\nThose who do not know cultivation\nare like those who do not weed their sprouts.\nThose who know cultivation but do not know when to stop\nare like those who pull the sprouts to help them grow.\nHow can one not be cautious?\n\nKnow that the gate of death is the gate of life—\ndo not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.\nIf you grasp the mechanism of killing and reversal,\nyou will see that harm contains the seed of grace.\n\nLife is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nGrace arises from harm,\nharm arises from grace.\nThis is the teaching of the *Yinfu Jing*.\nMaster Lü’s verse merely elucidates its depths.\nFor metal is born in *si*, dies in *zi*.\n*Zi* is the realm of water,\nyet metal can generate water.\nWood is born in *hai*, dies in *wu*.\n*Wu* is the realm of fire,\nyet wood can generate fire.\nWater and earth are born in *shen*, die in *mao*.\n*Mao* is the position of wood,\nyet water can generate wood.\nThus, life is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nYet while the root of life and death is fixed,\nthe meaning of grace and harm differs.\nOnly the transformations of metal and fire\ncannot be judged by life and death.\nThe *Longhu Shangjing* says:\n“Metal and fire are the true medicine.”\nIn the art of the elixir, nothing is more manifest than metal and fire.\nFor fire is born in *yin*, dies in *you*.\n*You* is the realm of metal—\nthis fire can only overcome metal,\nhow can it generate metal?\nMoreover, *you* is the realm where metal flourishes,\nwhile fire is in its place of death.\nUnable to overcome it as harm,\nmetal instead receives its flourishing as grace.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n“When metal enters the fierce fire,\nits color does not lose its radiant light.”\nIs this not grace born from harm?\nThis is the principle of reversal in the mechanism of killing—\nwithout penetrating insight into the transformations of the five phases,\nit cannot be known.\nSome mistakenly take the gate of life and gate of death\nas the yin and hidden places of women,\nand “grace born from harm” as the art of sexual union that harms virtue.\nThis is wrong.\nThe great Dao is pure and tranquil, fundamentally undefiled—\nhow could filthy conduct lead to immortality?\n\nFortune and misfortune arise in mutual dependence,\nlike echo following sound, shadow following form.\nIf you can turn this mechanism of life and killing,\ndisaster transforms into blessing in the turn of a palm.\n\nFortune leans upon misfortune,\nmisfortune lurks within fortune—\nlike echo answering sound, shadow following form,\nit cannot be ignored.\nIf one learns the Dao and cultivates the true,\nvirtue and fortune grow lofty,\nlife endures, vision persists,\none becomes an immortal among mortals—\nthis is the wondrous Dao of emerging from death and entering life.\nBut if one turns from the Dao and harms life,\nindulging in sensual pleasures,\none becomes a walking corpse, a moving privy,\nhastening only to decay and ruin.\nThe mechanism shifts from life to killing,\nfortune turns to disaster—\nas easily as turning a palm.\nFrom this, we see:\n“Following the good brings fortune,\nfollowing the perverse brings misfortune”—\nlike echo and shadow,\nthe Confucian and Daoist scriptures share the same principle.\n\nCultivate while mingling with the world, harmonizing your light.\nRound when round, square when square.\nManifest or hidden, yielding or resisting—\nnone can fathom your conduct or concealment.\nHow can others discern your actions or retreat?\n\nThe great hermit dwells in the world,\nthe lesser hermit dwells in the mountains—\nwhy?\nThe world is the marketplace,\nyet the cultivator of the true who dwells there,\nwith a mind unmoved, pure and unadulterated,\ncannot be swayed by wine, sex, wealth, or anger,\nnor altered by riches or honor, fame or achievement—\nthis is why it is called the great hermitage.\n\nAs for mountains—secluded wilds of forests and foothills—hermits dwelling there may indeed harbor no stray thoughts. Yet when they emerge and encounter the flourishing world, the mere sight of what is desirable stirs the common passions, and cravings surge as before. This is why it is called the lesser hermitage.\n\nMaster Pingshu said: The cultivator must mingle with the world, never adopting conduct that sets them apart. They harmonize their light and merge with the dust, adapting to roundness or squareness as circumstances demand, embracing all without attachment, now manifest, now hidden, now yielding, now resisting—like clouds drifting unimpeded, beyond others’ comprehension. Serene as the vast heavens, unburdened by the myriad forms, this is how one attains the Dao.\n\nThose who flaunt their uniqueness, seeking to astonish the world with extraordinary deeds, reveal their conduct and concealment to others. Not only do they fail to accomplish the Way, but few escape harm in the world. Thus, at the close of the sixty-four poems, the teaching is emphatically imparted to later learners.\n\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Fifth Chapter of Spring, concludes.*\n\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the Sixth*\n*Written by Xia Zongyu of Yongjia, the Cloud Peak Recluse*\n\n**Five-Word Quatrain**—Its first line aligns with the number of the Great Unity.\nA maiden dons azure robes,\nHer lord dons silken white.\nSeen, it cannot be employed;\nEmployed, it cannot be seen.\nIn the dim and vague, they meet,\nIn the deep and dark, change arises.\nIn a flash, flames take flight—\nThe Perfected One appears of itself.\n\nMaster Pingshu’s poem employs the method of the Great Unity’s number. The profound subtleties of the Great Dao are fully revealed, yet without a teacher’s transmission, even the wise and discerning will struggle to fathom it. Now, the maiden is yin; the lord is yang. Azure robes are the wood of the east, Jia and Yi; silken white is the metal of the west, Geng and Xin. Male and female differ in form, yin and yang in qi, metal and wood in essence, east and west in position—how could these be the Dao? Only the sage harmonizes and unites them, causing male and female, yin and yang to interact within the central palace, metal and wood, east and west to merge upon the Yellow Way. When the maiden dons azure robes, yin can bear yang; when the lord dons silken white, yang can embrace yin. Naturally, harmony accumulates within, brilliance radiates without; the empty chamber generates brightness, fullness shines with splendor. Thus, *seen, it cannot be employed; employed, it cannot be seen*—this is precisely the Confucian and Daoist principle of standing tall and resolute. To stand is to see it before one—this is the meaning of *seen*. Yet when one gazes ahead, it suddenly appears behind; though one wishes to follow, there is no way—this is *cannot be employed*. The Buddhist’s *perfectly round, radiant, luminous, and free* is the meaning of *employed*, while its *cool wisdom, wondrously complete, body naturally empty and still* is *cannot be seen*. The Most High said: *Dim and vague, within it there is something*; thus, meeting in the dim and vague is not without perception. *Deep and dark, within it there is essence*; thus, change within the deep and dark is not without use. Preserving the insubstantial while guarding the substantial, in an instant it is accomplished—most divine, most effortless. Is this not *in a flash, flames take flight, the Perfected One appears of itself*? Thus, a body is born beyond the body, nature is seen upon nature; coming and going are free, the original face is recognized. Therefore, from this ordinary fire arises true fire, from this ordinary person emerges the Perfected One. Yet is the dim and vague truly so? From nothing arises something, from something arises nothing—mystery within mystery, wonder within wonder. One may speak of it with immortals, but it is hard to speak of it with the mortal-boned.\n\n**Twelve *Xijiangyue* Poems**—Corresponding to the twelve months.\nThe inner elixir resembles the outer,\nThe inner must connect with the outer.\nThe cinnabar head’s benefits and harms are roughly the same;\nNurturing employs two methods.\n\nWithin, there is the celestial true fire,\nThe crucible glows with enduring crimson.\nThe outer furnace’s increase and decrease require diligent effort—\nNo wonder surpasses the true seed.\n\nThe essential Dao of immortal cultivation lies in refining the golden liquid and returning elixir. Yet the elixir is divided into inner and outer, and nurturing employs two methods. Both must be harmonized to transcend the mortal and enter the sagely. If there is inner elixir but no outer elixir, the physical form—composed of father’s essence and mother’s blood, the four great elements provisionally combined—remains a mortal shell, heavy and stagnant, without transmutation. How could one attain the Dao? If there is outer elixir but no inner elixir, though the great medicine is wondrous, it remains external, a mere thing. Seeking within, the celestial true has been depleted, spirit exhausted, qi scattered, essence and spirit dull. Applying the outer elixir is like boiling an empty cauldron—it only hastens ruin, never achieving transformation. Master Pingshu’s verses first clarify the inner and outer elixirs. Does he not understand the Dao? Moreover, the outer elixir uses only lead and mercury, with no杂 or impurities. The five metals, eight stones, herbs, and decayed matter are all excluded. Through fire phases of withdrawal and addition, emulating heaven and earth’s patterns, prolonged refinement circulates qi through the celestial cycles, and one may become a treasured immortal. As the scripture says: *Once the great medicine is complete, magpies feeding become phoenixes, crows eating become simurghs, dogs licking become dragons, and humans consuming ascend as immortals.* As for the inner elixir within the body—neither heart nor kidney, neither lung nor spleen, neither qi nor essence, neither blood nor fluid—it is also nothing but lead and mercury, yin and yang paired. Refined with true fire and primal yang, it mirrors the outer elixir, causing the crucible to glow crimson. Following the proper times for increase and decrease, one refines it into a purely yang substance, casting no shadow at noon. Only then may one ingest the outer elixir, making both form and spirit wondrous, merging with the true Dao, shedding the mortal shell, and ascending in broad daylight. Thus, *the inner elixir resembles the outer; the inner must connect with the outer*—one cannot be partial and incomplete. Yet why are the true seed the same, while nurturing employs two methods? What is shared is lead and mercury; the difference lies in the fire phases. For the outer elixir, one uses ordinary charcoal and human-made fire; for the inner elixir, one employs the celestial true fire.\n\n**Xijiangyue**\nThis Dao is most divine, most sagely—\nI fear your meager fate cannot endure it.\n\nHarmonizing lead and mercury takes not even a morning—\nsoon the mystic pearl’s form appears in omen.\nIf the aspirant can cultivate and refine,\nwhy should one not dwell in market or court?\n\nThe work is easy, the medicine not distant—\nspeaking of it, people must break into laughter.\nHow profound! In five hundred years, qi gives birth to the worthy,\nnone but earth’s spirits and humanity’s heroes.\n\nOf those who embody virtue, merit, literature, and governance—\nthose who aid their lords and benefit the people—\nthe world is never lacking.\nYet those who are most divine, most sagely,\nbecoming immortals among men,\nwhose yin merits and yang virtues align with Heaven’s heart,\nwho ascend in broad daylight—\nsuch persons are truly rare.\n\nIf one is not born with numinous bones,\nprofound fortune, and a destiny to encounter a sagely teacher,\nhow could one attain this?\nYet the divine and sagely Way of the golden elixir\nis nothing more than two substances: lead and mercury.\nOnce fire phases are harmonized,\nin but a moment the mystic pearl’s form appears in omen.\n\nThe determined aspirant, if diligent in cultivation,\nknows no distinction of noble or base.\nIn court, one may still govern the state and pacify the realm;\nin the marketplace, one does not lose the work of scholar, farmer, artisan, or merchant.\nAs the earlier poem says:\n*Do not rashly abandon your wife, vainly severing yin and yang’s bond;\ndo not starve yourself, pointlessly emptying stomach and bowels.\nThe five viscera—heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys—\nare wearied by vain visualization;\nthe seven treasures—tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, humor—\nare squandered in futile swallowing and spitting.*\n\nAll the three-year, nine-year regimens,\nthe three thousand six hundred heterodox methods—\nnone are of use to the golden elixir.\nAlas! The Way is most divine, most sagely;\nthe medicine is easy, not distant.\nAs the saying goes: *The Way lies before one’s eyes, yet people do not see it;\nspeak of it, and they laugh—what doubt remains?*\nThe Most High said:\n*When lesser men hear the Dao, they laugh greatly.\nIf they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.*\n\n**Xijiangyue**\nThe White Tiger’s *First Scripture* is the supreme treasure;\nthe Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.\nThus we know the highest good’s beneficent source runs deep—\nnot to be compared with ordinary medicines.\nTo forge it requires ninefold refinement,\nfirst requiring the tempering of the self and mastery of the mind.\nFollow the times to gather and determine ascent and descent;\nadvance the fire while ever guarding against peril.\n\nThe White Tiger is the essence of metal.\nThe *First Scripture* is the primal valley spirit.\nThe supreme treasure is the luminous treasury of awareness.\nThe Flowery Pond is the crescent-moon furnace.\nDivine water is the water of numinous clarity.\nTrue gold is the great medicine of the golden elixir.\nThe highest good is the peerless, wondrous Way.\nThe beneficent source is the inexhaustible wellspring.\nNinefold refinement is the nine-returned golden body.\nTempering the self and mastering the mind is the leakless body of the seven treasures.\nGathering has its time; taking has its day.\nAscent and descent are the two substances of yin and yang’s rising and falling.\nAdvancing the fire and guarding against peril means that once the elixir is ripe, fire phases need not be applied.\nAn ancient immortal said:\n*The arts of the golden elixir number in the hundreds,\nbut their essence lies in divine water and the Flowery Pond.*\nYet Heaven engenders water—how could water arise naturally?\nOnly metal can generate water.\nMetal is indestructible, enduring for ten thousand ages.\nReceiving Heaven’s true qi of the One, it gives birth to water—\nthus the essence of metal is the *First Scripture* and supreme treasure.\nOnce the Flowery Pond engenders divine water,\ndivine water in turn engenders true gold—\nthis is what is meant by *the mother hidden in the child’s womb*,\nthe *water-borne metal*, the *lead of the watery realm*.\n\nThe Most High said: *The highest good is like water.*\n*The Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* says: *Cut off profit at its source.*\nLü Dongbin said: *To return the elixir sevenfold,\none must first refine the self and await the time.*\nOnly when essence, qi, and spirit are complete,\nthe three fields full,\nand one’s virtue merged with Heaven and Earth—\nonly then, in the rising and falling of yin and yang,\non that day of the month, at that hour of the day,\ngently gather, neither exceeding nor falling short,\ndetermining ascent and descent—\ncan one seize Heaven and Earth’s creative power,\naligning the mechanism with perfect accord, not erring by a hair’s breadth.\nOnce the elixir is accomplished,\nguard tranquility and nurture qi;\ndo not recklessly advance the fire.\nImmortal Zhongli said:\n*Once the elixir is ripe, fire phases need not be applied;\nif fire is still added, danger will overturn the hexagram.*\n\n**Xijiangyue**\nSeven returns—cinnabar returns to its root;\nnine returns—the golden body returns to truth.\nDo not reckon by *yin* and *zi* to *kun* and *shen*;\nonly observe the completion of the Five Agents.\nIt is originally but a single taste of mercury,\ncirculating through all the celestial stems.\nWhen yin and yang’s qi are full, it naturally becomes numinous—\nin its comings and goings, how could it depart from the Mysterious Female?\n\nThe discourse on seven returns and nine returns\nis the profound mystery of the great Way of the golden elixir.\nWithout encountering a sagely teacher, scholars idly speculate,\nsome even counting from *zi* to *shen* as nine returns,\nfrom *yin* to *shen* as seven returns—this is incorrect.\n*The Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says:\n*In the clarity of elixir arts, nothing surpasses metal and fire.*\nMetal and fire are the sun and moon’s souls and spirits.\nIn the first half of the month, on the third day, the moon begins to generate its spirit—\nits body belongs to metal.\nMetal’s number is four, its completion number nine—\nthus it is said: *On the third day, the Dui gate opens anew,\nand from the black-silver crucible emerges white silver.*\nThis is the arising of metal’s qi, called the *nine returns*.\nIn the latter half of the month, the spirit’s light gradually wanes,\nand the day when the sun receives the tally is called *fire*,\nalso named cinnabar—red without, white within.\nIt steals the moon’s light, augmenting the sun’s true fire.\nFire’s number is two, its completion number seven—\nthus it is called the *seven returns*.\nYet though the meaning of return lies in metal and fire,\ntracing their source, they are originally but a single taste of mercury.\nFor Heaven engenders water—water is the elixir’s mother.\nAll movement in Heaven and Earth,\nthe rising and falling of sun and moon,\noccur within the water wheel.\nThe yin-yang transformations of the human body\nlie in the watery realm of Kan.\nFrom the first yang’s arising at *zi*,\nto the descent of yin after *wu*,\nrevolving and beginning anew,\npassing through all the celestial stems,\nwhen the qi of the celestial cycle is full,\nit naturally becomes numinous.\nYet in its comings and goings,\nhow could it depart from the Mysterious Female?\n\nThe Valley Spirit never dies—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nis the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSuch is the profound mystery of the Golden Elixir.\n\n*To the tune of \"Moon over the West River\"*\nIf you would have true lead retain mercury,\nwithin kinship, they never leave as lord and minister.\nWood and metal, though sundered, meet without cause—\na go-between must draw them near.\n\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nmetal’s essence cherishes wood’s kindness.\nThey devour each other, yet grow intimate—\nonly then is there conception within the void.\n\nIn refining the Golden Elixir,\nnothing lies beyond lead and mercury.\nYet mercury, prone to flight, is hard to retain—\nonly when true lead is obtained can mercury be held fast.\nFor they are conjoined by a single qi,\nkin within the household, never of different kind,\nnaturally drawn to each other in devotion.\nAlas! Once the Great Simplicity divides,\neast as *Zhen* and west as *Dui*,\nwood and metal stand apart, meeting without cause.\nNow, through the elixir’s method, a go-between must draw them near—\nthis is the Yellow Dame.\nThe principle of union employs the central office of earth.\nFor earth engenders metal, metal restrains wood,\nand wood restrains earth—\nthree natures of distinct substance,\ndevouring each other yet growing intimate.\nThis is the method of inverting the Five Phases.\nAs the *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* says:\n\"Within harm, kindness is born.\"\n\nThe Immortals’ scriptures say:\n\"Following the sequence, one becomes human;\nreversing it, the elixir is employed.\"\nFor what generates in sequence is kindness,\nwhile what restrains in reversal is harm.\n\"Only then is there conception within the void\"—\nfor the substances of metal and wood differ in outer form,\nyet wood’s liquid and metal’s essence inwardly resonate in qi,\nas when one \"chips open the marrow of chaos,\nsplits forth the essence of *Kan* and *Li*.\"\nFrom this, the elixir is made—\nthus conception within the void may be known.\nAs the Most High says:\n\"Vague and indistinct,\nyet within it there is something.\"\nWhat is this if not conception?\n\n*To the tune of \"Moon over the West River\"*\nWhose is the maiden of two eights?\nWhere is the gentleman of nine threes?\nThey call themselves wood’s liquid and metal’s essence—\nwhen they meet earth, the three natures form.\n\nWith Ding Gong’s forging and refining,\nhusband and wife at last unite in joy.\nThe River Chariot dares not tarry—\nit carries them to the summit of Kunlun Peak.\n\nThe two eights are the number of yin.\nThe maiden is the yin woman.\nThe nine threes are the number of yang.\nThe gentleman is the yang man.\nWood’s liquid is the liquid of the *Zhen* dragon of the east,\nthe image of water engendering wood.\nMetal’s essence is the essence of the white tiger of the west,\nthe image of metal engendering water.\nEarth is the central office of *Wu* and *Ji*.\nDing Gong is the fire’s timing.\nThe River Chariot is the true qi of the north,\nthe image of the River Chariot’s conveyance.\nKunlun is the divine chamber of the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nIn this passage, Master Puzhao has expounded the true ground of the Golden Elixir—\nits firing times, medicines, and substances—\nyet out of compassion for those who might not grasp it,\nhe has left it obscure.\nNow, the purely yang is Heaven and the immortal;\nthe purely yin is Earth and the ghost.\nThat which holds both yin and yang is the human.\nMoreover, the Way is called the union of one yin and one yang.\nWhat continues it is goodness;\nwhat completes it is nature.\nThe *Great Change* speaks of this profoundly—\nhow is it different from the Way of the Golden Elixir?\nFor the Golden Elixir within the human body\nlies in nothing beyond the workings of yin and yang.\nThus, in terms of numbers, there are two eights and three nines;\nin terms of people, there are the gentleman and the maiden;\nin terms of the Five Phases, there are metal and wood;\nin terms of the Four Images, there are the dragon and the tiger;\nin terms of human affairs, there are husband and wife.\nA thousand chapters and ten thousand verses—\nall are but metaphors and allegories, nothing more.\n\nFrom the primordial ancestral qi,\nchaos was one.\nOnce the Great Ultimate divided,\nit separated into two.\nBecause of this division,\nodd and even differ in number,\nmale and female differ in body,\nmetal and wood differ in substance,\neast and west differ in direction,\ndragon and tiger differ in image.\nNow, if one wishes to return to the origin and refine the elixir,\none must unite the disparate and return to the same.\nWithout returning to the central office,\nhow could the two merge into one?\nThus it is said: when they meet earth, the three natures form—\nthis is the place where the Yellow Dame arranges the match.\nThough the two substances have form and substance,\nhow could they truly become one?\nIt is only through the resonance of essence and liquid,\nthe blending of spirit and qi,\nthe subtle communion across barriers—\nlike a lodestone drawing iron—\nthat a single point of true yang’s numinous clarity shines through.\nThus, it is not called \"wood\" but \"wood’s liquid,\"\nnot \"metal\" but \"metal’s essence\"—\nthe meaning is profound.\nYet how could metal and wood naturally possess essence and liquid?\nThey must rely on Ding Gong’s forging and refining,\nthe firing times of withdrawal and addition—\nonly then can yin and yang unite in marriage,\nonly then can metal and water form the elixir.\nThis fire is not the wind-fire of *Xun*,\nnor the heart-fire of *Li* at noon,\nbut the true qi of the *Kan* palace in the north,\ncalled the River Chariot’s ceaseless conveyance,\nascending straight to the summit of Kunlun Peak in the Mud Pill Palace.\nA single point of true yang illumines the cosmos—\nthis is \"sinking to the sea’s depths,\nembracing the sun’s rising.\"\nStriking through the Three Passes,\npiercing the highest realm,\nthe radiant Golden Elixir forms at the moment of metal and wood’s union.\nHow distant then is the immortal’s Way?\n\n*Exegesis of the Sixth Spring of Master Purple Yang’s \"Awakening to Reality\" Complete*\n*Exegesis of Master Purple Yang’s \"Awakening to Reality,\" Scroll Seven*\n\n**Cloud Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia’s \"Moon Over the West River\"**\n\n*\"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love is the Dao’s root,\nTortoise and Serpent’s kindred nature heaven-bestowed.\nToad and Crow meet at the dark moon’s embrace,\nThe two qi mutually sustain their revolving dance.\n\nAll is the marvelous work of Qian and Kun—\nWho fathoms this profound abyss?\nWhen yin and yang are sundered, fault arises,\nHow then can heaven endure, earth abide long?\"*\n\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl signify the union of husband and wife. The Tortoise and Serpent symbolize water and fire. The Toad and Crow are the essences of moon and sun. Qian and Kun represent the pairing of heaven and earth. This one yin and one yang are called the Dao; the conjoining of sun and moon is called the Elixir. With yang alone and no yin, yang has nothing to transform. With yin alone and no yang, yin has nothing to generate. The two qi mutually sustain each other, revolving and transmuting—now separating, now uniting—endlessly wondrous in their workings. Thus, like the Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love bound in green, this is the root of the Dao. Water-Tortoise and Fire-Serpent, *Kan* and *Li*, unite in natural affinity. Moon-Toad and Sun-Crow meet at the dark moon’s phase, their radiance enduring. Heaven-*Qian* and Earth-*Kun* embrace and uphold all with vastness, their marvelous workings divine. Man, standing as one of the Three Powers alongside heaven and earth, likewise relies on the pairing of yin and yang to complete the Dao—termed the Mysterious Female, Lead and Mercury, Dragon and Tiger, Crow and Hare, Metal and Wood, Water and Fire, Black and White, East and West, *Kan* and *Li*, Husband and Wife. The names are innumerable, yet all embody the principle of yin and yang’s mutual resonance. Should yin remain solely yin and yang solely yang, sundered and uncommunicating, fault arises and life is cut short. How then can one emerge from death and enter life, enduring as long as heaven and earth?\n\n---\n\n**Moon Over the West River**\n\n*\"Within the male lies hidden feminine essence,\nBearing yin yet embracing yang’s essence.\nWhen the two harmonize, the medicine is complete—\nTransmuting soul and spirit, sacred and numinous.\n\nTrust in the single grain of Golden Elixir:\nThe serpent swallows it and at once becomes a dragon.\nThe fowl feeds on it and transforms into a phoenix—\nAll enter the true realm of pure yang.\"*\n\nThe one yin and one yang are called the Dao; the union of sun and moon is called the Elixir. Yet the sun, yang and fire, contains within it the moon’s crow—masculine with feminine concealed. The moon, yin and water, bears within it the sun’s hare—carrying yin yet embracing yang. For the crow pertains to *geng* and *xin* Metal, the hare to *jia* and *yi* Wood. Let no barrier divide them, and the sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po* will harmonize in one place, becoming supremely numinous and sacred. The Mysterious Pearl takes form, and the Golden Elixir is completed in an instant. The external medicine follows the same principle: yin and yang pair and transmute into the Elixir. Serpent and fowl, upon ingesting it, likewise transform into dragon and phoenix—how much more so for man, how much more for attaining the Dao? Both inner and outer elixirs take yang essence as their foundation. Regardless of whether man or beast, if one can refine yin with yang, unifying soul, spirit, sacred and numinous, then a single grain of Golden Elixir—swallowed by the serpent, it becomes a dragon; fed to the fowl, it becomes a phoenix; taken by man, he ascends as an immortal—all enter the true realm of pure yang.\n\nWithout discerning the Five Phases and Four Images,\nhow can one distinguish cinnabar-mercury from lead-silver?\nUnversed in the art of fire-timing and withdrawal-addition,\none prematurely styles oneself a recluse.\n\nFailing to reflect on one’s own errors,\none further teaches these mistaken paths to others,\nleading them astray for generations in the maze of delusion—\nhow can such negligence bear the weight of conscience?\n\nThe Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.\nThe Four Images are Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior.\nCinnabar-mercury is mercury drawn from cinnabar.\nLead-silver is silver drawn from lead.\nFire-timing refers to the fire of true yang and the seasonal tokens of its rhythm.\n\nMaster Pingshu admonished that scholars recklessly misidentify:\nthe lungs as Metal, the liver as Wood, the kidneys as Water,\nthe heart as Fire, and the spleen as Earth.\nThey further assign the liver to the Green Dragon, the lungs to the White Tiger,\nthe heart to the Vermilion Bird, and the kidneys to the Dark Warrior.\nSuch conflations of the Five Phases and Four Images\nrender the refinement of the Golden Elixir utterly indiscriminate,\nunable to distinguish cinnabar-mercury from lead-silver.\nNor are these Five Phases and Four Images to be sought outside the body—\nfor lead and cinnabar are tangible substances,\njust as the five viscera possess tangible forms.\nHow then can they serve as the foundation for attaining the Dao?\n\nOnly by discerning the intangible function within tangible form\ndoes one progress from the coarse to the refined,\ntranscending the mundane to enter the sacred,\nthereby grasping the secret of lead and mercury.\nYet even if one recognizes cinnabar and black lead,\nignorance of fire-timing renders such knowledge idle.\nHow much worse to lack understanding entirely,\nyet mislead others with false instruction—\na case of the blind leading the blind,\nwith no hope of escape.\nCan such a heart endure its own indifference?\n\n---\n\nHeaven and Earth alternate between closure and openness;\ndawn and dusk must recognize the cycles of inception and obscurity.\nLike spokes converging at the hub, like rivers flowing to the sea—\nthe marvel lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.\n\nAttain the One, and ten thousand affairs are complete;\ncease dividing east from west, south from north.\nReduce and refine with utmost care, guarding prior merit—\nthe Treasure of Life must not be trifled with.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite, it is called *Peace* (泰),\nwhere upper yin meets lower yang.\nWhen they fail to unite, it is called *Stagnation* (否),\nwhere upper yang meets lower yin.\n*Cloud and Thunder* (屯) signifies the inception of difficulty,\nas the noble one weaves the warp and weft of creation—\nthings in their nascent struggle must not be harmed.\n*Youthful Folly* (蒙) depicts a spring emerging from the mountain’s base,\nas the noble one nurtures virtue through resolute action—\nthe spring’s first flow must be guided with innocence to cultivate integrity.\n\nThese four hexagrams’ meanings,\nwhen applied as metaphors for the Golden Elixir,\nare perfectly apt.\nYet some divide the sixty-four hexagrams into thirty days,\ndesignating *Heaven* (乾), *Earth* (坤), *Water* (坎), and *Fire* (離) as the furnace and crucible—\nhow forced and contrived!\n\nThey fail to grasp that the Dao consists of the interplay of yin and yang,\nwhile the work lies in the alternations of *Stagnation* (否), *Peace* (泰), *Inception* (屯), and *Folly* (蒙).\nIn the language of the Golden Elixir,\nall depends on the essence of yin-yang union.\nIf Heaven remains Heaven and Earth remains Earth,\n*Stagnation* persists, unyielding—\nhow then can they unite as *Peace*?\nWithout such union, how can yin and yang embody the Dao?\nHow can the Great Medicine become the Elixir?\n\nAs for morning as *Inception* (屯) and evening as *Folly* (蒙),\nthis signifies vigilance in preservation—\never mindful of the difficulty of inception and the nurturing of innocence,\nnever allowing a single stray thought or moment of indulgence.\nVigilant where unseen, fearful where unheard,\none remains unwavering in the fleeting moments of dawn and dusk.\nThrough such cultivation,\nspokes converge at the hub like a chariot in motion, flawless and unbroken,\nlike water flowing in its course, turning myriad bends yet ever eastward.\nThus the mechanism of the primordial qi of True Unity\nresonates in perfect accord with the celestial rhythm,\nwithdrawal and addition harmonizing the workings of Heaven’s design.\n\nHaving attained this Treasure of Life,\none must uphold its fullness and preserve its achievement.\nAs *Baopuzi* states:\n“If a person can guard the One, the One will guard the person.\nIf a person cannot guard the One, the One will depart.”\nIs this not why the Treasure of Life must not be trifled with?\n\n---\n\nAt the Winter Solstice, the yang returns in *Recovery* (復);\nevery thirty days, a yang line is added.\nIn the moon’s cycle, *Recovery* (復) appears at dawn on the new moon,\nwhile at full moon, *Heaven* (乾) culminates before yielding to *Encounter* (姤).\nThe sun, too, marks the turning of cold and heat—\nyang revives at midnight, while at noon,\nthe image of conception heralds the advent of yin.\nOnly in the alchemy of the Elixir does one discern the mysteries of dawn and dusk.\n\nA year comprises three hundred and sixty days,\nwith six yin and six yang lines waxing and waning,\nclustered within the hexagrams’ configurations.\nThere is the Winter Solstice of the year,\nthe Winter Solstice of the month,\nand the Winter Solstice of the day.\nSix positions intermingle, a single yang stirring amidst them—\nthe twelve hexagrams complete,\nand the celestial Dao becomes luminous,\nthe fire-timing of the celestial cycle fulfilled.\n\nIn the year’s cycle, yang revives at the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice,\nthe eleventh month governed by *Earth-Thunder Recovery* (地雷復),\nmarked by one yang line.\nThe twelfth month, governed by the *chou* branch,\nis ruled by *Earth-Marsh Approach* (地澤臨),\nwith two yang lines.\nThe first month, governed by the *yin* branch,\nis ruled by *Earth-Heaven Peace* (地天泰),\nwith three yang lines.\nEach month, a hexagram shifts every thirty days,\nadvancing the fire-token—\nthus every thirty days, a yang line is added,\ncompleting the annual cycle of hexagrammatic qi.\n\nTo cluster the year’s months into the Winter Solstice of the month:\na month has thirty days, each day twelve hours,\ntotaling three hundred and sixty hours—\nequivalent to a year’s three hundred and sixty days.\nThe first day corresponds to *Recovery* (復),\nevery two and a half days to *Water* (坎),\nuntil the fifteenth day, when *Heaven* (乾) appears as pure yang.\nYet when yang reaches its zenith, yin arises—\non the sixteenth day, the full moon,\ngoverned by *Heaven-Wind Encounter* (天風姤),\nthe fire-token retreats as yin grows and yang wanes.\nThis is what is meant by “at full moon, *Heaven* (乾) culminates before yielding to *Encounter* (姤)”—\nthe daily hexagrams of the month mirror the annual celestial cycle.\n\nAs for clustering the year’s days into the Winter Solstice of the day:\na day’s twelve hours divide into the nodes of yin-yang ascent and descent.\nThe initial *zi* hour marks the Winter Solstice, when yang revives;\nthe *wu* hour marks the Summer Solstice, when yin revives.\nEach two-hour period corresponds to a hexagram,\nwith *Recovery* (復) and *Encounter* (姤) marking the inception of yin-yang advance and retreat,\nand *Heaven* (乾) and *Earth* (坤) marking their transformation.\nDay and night revolve within the hundred *ke*,\nthe workings of spirit transposed from days to hours—\nlikewise mirroring the annual cycle of hexagrammatic qi.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao set up gnomons and clepsydras externally to measure the celestial movements of the sun’s shadow, while internally they refine the True One to verify the clepsydra’s flow within their own bodies. Having grasped the Winter and Summer Solstices of the year in this way, they likewise comprehend the two solstices of the month and the two solstices of the day. Embracing the patterns of Heaven and emulating its images, they penetrate the mysteries of dusk and dawn, their spirits clear and their qi fresh, their hundred vessels harmonious and unobstructed. Though they may not yet ascend and soar to the heavens, how can this not surpass those who, lost in dissipation and lust, dwell as neighbors to ghosts?\n\nThis is to unite one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth, to merge one’s radiance with the sun and moon, to align with the sequence of the four seasons, and to harmonize with the auspices and omens of spirits and gods—how could this be heretical or distorted learning?\n\n*To the tune of* West River Moon:\nVirtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred,\nHidden merits accumulated fill three thousand.\nEqualizing self and others, friend and foe,\nOnly then does one fulfill the original vow of immortals.\n\nTigers, rhinos, blades, and weapons cannot harm,\nThe inescapable fire-house of impermanence cannot entangle.\nAfter the treasure talisman descends, one ascends to pay homage to Heaven,\nSteadily riding the phoenix-drawn chariot of the luan-bird.\n\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear,\nEarth attains the One and becomes tranquil,\nHumankind attains the One and becomes numinous.\nOur Confucian Way is threaded through by the One,\nThe Buddha’s teaching is that the One Mind is Buddha,\nThe Daoist method is that the True One abides forever.\n\nNow, why does Master Ping Shu speak of the disparity between eight hundred and three thousand? Alas, the essence of the Dao is one, yet its manifestations differ. Spanning ancient and modern, pervading Heaven and Earth, encompassing the myriad existences, exhausting the complexities of images and numbers—the Dao is present wherever one turns. Only those who cultivate the Dao fully comprehend it in their hearts and embody it in their conduct. Whether it be the Four Beginnings and ten thousand virtues all perfected, or the Six Perfections and ten thousand practices jointly cultivated, hidden merits and manifest virtues truly accumulated through long effort, equalizing self and others, friend and foe with impartial benevolence—only then does one fulfill the original vow of immortals.\n\nAs the ancient saying goes: “To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first fulfill the Dao of humanity.” Extending this mind onward, calamities naturally dissipate, and tigers, rhinos, blades, and weapons cannot harm. One leaps free from the world’s net of impermanence, and the fire-house cannot entangle. Aligning with the will of Heaven, the Great One bestows a summons. Like Master Zhang who ascended in broad daylight, or Master Xu who rose to the heavens, all received the Heaven-sent treasure talisman, the imperial edict to return to the Golden Gates, steadily riding the luan-carriage and phoenix-pennant to the Purple Palace. Such is the fruition of cultivating the Dao and upholding the Way—the season when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is achieved. Those with aspiration, can you not strive onward?\n\n*Commentary on the* Wondrous Realization *of Master Ziyang, Seventh Chapter of Spring, concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "At not yet fifty years of age, you now contemplate casting aside official cap and carriage to wander the vast seas and mountains with Anqi and Xianmen—this is a plan far too premature. I have lately heard Daoist teachings that attaining immortality is most difficult, save for those of utmost loyalty and filial piety, who may achieve it without cultivation. Though such claims seem remote and elusive, beyond easy comprehension, if celestial immortals truly exist, they must surely be those who were loyal ministers and filial sons—such attainment cannot be left to chance. With your talents, even if you do not seek to serve the world, the world will not leave you idle. Strive to establish merit in this enlightened age, repay the state and honor your family, fulfilling both loyalty and filial piety. Only then may you follow your remote ancestor, Xia Huanggong, to roam the orchards of Mount Shang—nothing will be beyond you.\n\nYou have also authored *Lecture Notes on the Yinfu Jing* and other works, which remain at Maogang Tower. Cishu has already written a preface for them, so I shall say no more.\n\nWritten on the third day after the Winter Solstice in the third year of the Baoqing era by Zhen Dexiu of Jian’an.\n\nAmong the many scholars of my homeland renowned for classical learning and literary ambition, none has yet been able to transmit the oral instructions of Zhang Pingshu’s *Awakening to Reality*. Yet Master Xia Zongyu alone, through secret transmission and seated instruction, has advanced in this Way—this is indeed extraordinary. From youth, he harbored lofty aspirations, believing merit and fame could be attained with ease. Over the past twenty years, he has studied under Masters Ying, Jia, and Xu, and shared hardships with Gou Mengyu in the military headquarters, traversing Qing and Qi, crossing the Taihang Mountains, and venturing deep into Tartar territory, enduring extreme toil and exhaustion. Later, his circumstances diverged from his wishes, and he withdrew from worldly affairs, ceasing even to speak of them. He composed three works—*The Mirror of Medicines*, *Lecture Notes on the Yinfu Jing*, and *Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality*—to which Daoist adepts have even sworn oaths to become his disciples.\n\nI have long admired those of ancient times who, having achieved merit and renown, retired like Fan Li to the Five Lakes or roamed with Master Red Pine, yet left not a single word behind. Might you now be burdened by your own writings? He replied: “I am no one who seeks to soar high and withdraw far. My aspirations will only be fulfilled when all people of later ages can reverse aging and return to youth, transcending the ordinary to enter the wondrous. Why should I惜 words?” This discourse is especially profound—worthy of reverence and admiration.\n\nWritten in the early spring of the first year of the Shaoding era by Cao Shuyuan, Minor Supervisor of the Secretariat, of Yongjia.\n\nHow can the Way be anything but rooted in one’s own body? The elixir of longevity and immortality—who could find it outside oneself? Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui—these are the elements of my body. Metal and Wood, Water and Fire—these are the elements of my body. Interlocking pears and fiery jujubes—these are the essences of my body. Nectar and jade liquor—these are the vital fluids of my body. Though a thousand forms and ten thousand shapes arise, none lie beyond this body. Yet ordinary people, though they know methods to preserve and protect it, cannot master its transformations. Only the perfected possess the art of inversion and reversal. Thus, they guard the true and embrace the One: the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger is born in water. Without inversion and reversal, how can the Way be accomplished? The seven returns and nine reversions—these are the wondrous grades. The eight reunions and six residences—these are the divine grades. Zhang Pingshu knew this; Xia Zongyu knows this; the Old Man of Shouzhang gazes in awe and sighs.\n\nWritten on an auspicious day in the first month of winter in the first year of the Shaoding era by Zhang Mizi, Gentleman of the Secretariat, of Siming.\n\n**Daoist Canon, Jade Instructions Section**\n*Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality by the Perfected of Purple Yang*\n\n**Title:** *Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality by the Perfected of Purple Yang*\nSeven juan, compiled by Xia Yuanding of the Southern Song.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Jade Instructions Section\n\n**Lecture Notes on the Awakening to Reality by the Perfected of Purple Yang, Volume One**\nBy Xia Zongyu, the Cloud Peak Recluse of Yongjia.",

      "translated_text": "Sixteen quatrains in heptasyllabic verse,\nTheir number mirroring the sixteen ounces of a catty.\n\nWho seeks not the Great Dao strays from the path,\nThough burdened with talent, how can one be a true man?\nA hundred years of life flicker like sparks from stone,\nA lifetime’s existence floats like bubbles on water.\nOnly craving rank and wealth for glory and fame,\nHeedless of one’s form withering unseen.\nTry asking if gold piled high as mountains\nCan buy back what impermanence denies.\n\n*The Assembly of Perfected on Western Mountain* states:\n\"Fame and profit must be sought, yet each has its destined measure—\nThose who see through this are free from entanglement.\nAffection and love must be cultivated, yet their karma is self-wrought—\nThose who see through this are free from attachment.\nMoreover, a human life spans a hundred years, yet seventy is rare.\nLike dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows—nothing is fixed or sure.\nThe deluded know only rank, wealth, and glory,\nPiling gold and jade, believing in eternal enjoyment.\nYet unaware that form withers unseen,\nAnd impermanence cannot be bought—\nIn the sudden moment like morning dew,\nWhat use are rank, gold, or jade to me?\n\nOnly the Great Dao is constant,\nTranscending the realm of things,\nNeither born nor destroyed,\nNeither coming nor going.\nWhile in the world, it regards all things without attachment.\nWhen weary of the world, it abides in the Dao to nurture the spirit.\nWealth cannot defile,\nGold and jade cannot taint,\nTime cannot age,\nImpermanence cannot approach—\nIs this not the true man?\n\nOtherwise, why would the ancient sages say,\n‘Immortality can be learned,\nDeathlessness can be attained through effort’?\n\nThough a human life may span a hundred years,\nLongevity or early death, poverty or success—none can be foreknown.\nYesterday, one rode through the streets on horseback;\nToday, one lies in a coffin as a sleeping corpse.\nWife and wealth, abandoned, are no longer yours,\nWhile karmic deeds follow—who can deceive themselves?\nIf the Great Elixir is not sought, how can one encounter it?\nAnd if encountered yet not refined, how foolish is that?\n\nLife and death, day and night—such is the natural order.\nYet if one holds to the Dao, though dead, one yet lives—\nHow much more so for the immortals, who attain deathless life?\nThus, ‘Hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die by evening.’\nThis does not mean that hearing the Dao hastens death,\nBut that even in death, one yet lives.\n‘Corpse-liberation and ascension’ describe their transformations—\nFor immortals can exit death and enter life.\n\nThe deluded, unaware, chase after the fields of desire,\nUncertain of the morrow, abandoning wife and wealth,\nWith karmic deeds clinging to them—\nPingshu deeply pities them.\nIf one but knows this, one must seek the Great Elixir to avoid such an end.\nYet this elixir is not sought externally—\nIt is said that everyone possesses the elixir of long life,\nBut without a teacher to point it out, it remains hidden.\nEven if one meets a teacher yet fails to cultivate,\nThe spark-like span of life swiftly passes through birth, aging, sickness, and death—\nHow foolish is that?\n\nThis method is true within the true, wondrous within the wondrous,\nAll because I alone differ from others.\nI know the inversion arises from *li* and *kan*,\nBut who recognizes the floating and sinking to determine host and guest?\nThe golden crucible seeks to retain cinnabar-clad mercury,\nThe jade pool first receives silver from the water.\nThe divine work of firing is not a full day’s labor—\nA single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool.\n\nThe poems of *Awakening to Reality* serve as the Supreme Lord’s proclamation of the secret principles of the Golden Elixir.\nYet the first two chapters merely exhort the world—\nIn truth, this chapter marks the beginning of profound discourse.\nHow many commentators have sought to explain it,\nYet none have fully elucidated its depths.\nHow then to guide later learners?\nThere is no other way:\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a true teacher, do not force guesses.\n\nThe wonder within the true, the true within the wonder—\nScholars take these as mere metaphors for the Great Dao,\nUnaware that the profound mysteries of the Golden Elixir\nPrecisely distinguish the true from the ordinary.\nThose who attain the true harmonize their virtue with heaven and earth.\nThose who master the wondrous remain unknown even to ghosts and spirits.\nBut if one falls into the ordinary,\nOne strays from the Dao and harms life.\n\n*Master Yunfang* said:\n\"A trifling celestial mechanism speaks of *qi* and essence—\nBeyond this true, there is no true.\"\n*The Mirror of Medicines* said:\n\"Following conditions, one attains the utmost true,\nWhich can manifest and transform, penetrating the divine.\"\n\nThus, Pingshu earnestly instructs on the distinction between true and ordinary.\nHe says, \"If you do not recognize the true lead as the primal ancestor,\"\nAnd, \"Diligently seek the true lead.\"\nHe says, \"If you wish to retain mercury with true lead,\"\nAnd, \"Within, there is the natural true fire.\"\nAs for \"using lead yet not using ordinary lead,\nAnd having used true lead, discarding it\"—\nAll this is to make one distinguish the difference between true and ordinary,\nFor this is the foundation of understanding the Dao,\nThe gateway to refining the Golden Elixir—\nHow can one neglect it without reflection?\n\nMoreover, *li* (☲) is the south, noon—yang, fire.\n*Kan* (☵) is the north, midnight—yin, water.\nYang fire flames upward, yin water moistens downward,\nAbove and below, as if deaf and uncommunicative, never uniting.\nYet within *li*, one line is even—an image of outer yang and inner yin.\nThus, yin carries yang and tends downward,\nYin descends, and yang descends with it.\nWithin *kan*, one line is odd—an image of outer yin and inner yang.\nThus, yang carries yin and rushes upward,\nYang ascends, and yin ascends with it.\nThough this describes the ascent and descent of yin and yang,\nIt is not the method of inverting *kan* and *li*.\nThe world clings to this,\nOften taking the heart as *li* and the kidneys as *kan*,\nMaking heart and kidneys unite,\nWater and fire harmonize,\nAnd clinging to this as the work of the Golden Elixir—\nThis is not so. It is merely the method of peace and joy.\n\nFor the heart and kidneys have form and substance,\nWaxing and waning—\nHow can they be the Dao?\nOnly the immortals can empty *kan* and fill *li*,\nEmploying the method of inversion.\n\nWhy?\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate divided,\nThere was a thing, undifferentiated—\nWhat was *li*, what was *kan*?\nFrom \"Heaven generates one, water,\"\n\"Earth generates two, fire\"—\nOnly after water and fire separated were *kan* and *li* delineated.\nThus, two yin embrace one yang to form *kan* (☵).\n*Kan* is full, its outer image water,\nYet within it, yang fire is born.\nThe immortals must refine this yang to empty its center,\nRaising its fire for the work of the Golden Elixir.",

      "translated_text": "Two yang embrace one yin to form *li* (☲). *Li* is hollow at its center, its outer image fire, yet within it, yin water is born. The immortals must refine this yin to fill its center, uniting its lines to form a body of pure yang. Thus, when *kan* is emptied, it becomes *kun* (☷); when *li* is filled, it becomes *qian* (☰). This is the transformation of the Qian Dao, each rectifying its nature and destiny—taking the fullness from the *kan* position in the heart and infusing it into the yin within the *li* palace of the abdomen. As for the heart and kidneys uniting, water and fire harmonizing—what does this have to do with the matter?\n\nAs for the theories of floating and sinking, guest and host, they are no mere allegories. Within the human body, there is a thing: one floats, one sinks; one is guest, one is host. The qi and vessels communicate subtly without interruption. Should the sinking one suffer loss, the floating one also suffers. If the host is deficient, the guest is likewise deficient. Thus, to retain cinnabar mercury in the golden crucible, one must first deposit liquid mercury in the jade pool—then the root flourishes and the branches thrive, the source runs deep and the flow endures.\n\nYet mercury and lead cannot transform themselves; they must rely on the fire of divine skill, drawn and added in operation, before the mysterious pearl takes form and the radiant red elixir is completed. This is achieved in less than a morning, and the Dao-fruit is perfected.\n\nMaster Haichan said: *\"Sink to the ocean’s depths, and embrace the rising sun.\"* Is this not the manifestation of the solar wheel in the deep pool?\n\nAttaining the Dao in this way, I truly differ from others. This chapter reveals the marrow of the Golden Elixir and discloses the celestial mechanism. If scholars can grasp the meaning through the text, then the Dao is present before their eyes—no need for the three thousand six hundred gates.\n\nTiger leaps, dragon soars—waves surge rough,\nAt the central true position, the luminous pearl is born.\nThough fruit on branches may ripen in time,\nHow is the child in the womb different?\n\nNorth and South sects invert the hexagrams’ images,\nMorning and evening fire-timing aligns with the celestial pivot.\nKnow that great reclusion dwells in the marketplace—\nDo not seek solitude in the deep mountains.\n\nThe dragon is a yang thing; the tiger, a yin thing. Their union, symbolized by dragon and tiger, yields the mysterious pearl in a moment’s work at the true position. The true position is the place where the yellow center penetrates principle. It is like fruit growing on branches or a child in the womb—when the qi-cycles of the celestial circuit are complete, it naturally matures. The North and South sects’ inversion of hexagrams is precisely the earlier principle of inverting *kan* and *li*. Dao Guang said: *\"Face south to observe the Northern Dipper, and within stillness gather true lead.\"* Morning and evening fire-timing aligns with the celestial pivot, as in *\"morning Layering, evening Ignorance\"*—harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, all following natural timing, not confined to sitting in vigil on *gengshen* nights or exhaling and inhaling at *zi* and *wu* hours.\n\nThose who attain this Dao are neither noble nor base, neither in the marketplace nor the mountains. If a determined scholar can cultivate this, there is no harm in dwelling in the city or serving at court.\n\nTrue Man Wang Ding said: *\"Kan-tiger, Li-dragon, tortoise essence, phoenix marrow—knowing you have awakened to the elixir’s origin, the wind-lamp is hard to preserve. Best to advance in cultivation now. It does not lie in visualizing heart and kidneys, nor in sitting alone in the cliffs. Do you understand, sir? The medicine is before your eyes, rising and sinking from dawn to dusk. If you can grasp even a little of the yang essence, the subtlety requires no further seeking.\"*\n\nMay the winding river be clear and still, the divine water flow westward. Let metal and wood not be obstructed, and may the yang hun and yin po unite.

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Sprout and White Snow are the supreme nine-grade elixir of the ancient sages, refined from the essence of the Primordial Lord’s Wood through the crucible of water and fire. With no regard for years or months, through prolonged refinement and nurturing, its radiant essence naturally coalesces into auspiciousness, transcending the vulgar qualities of cinnabar and mercury. This may be called \"from nonbeing into being, from the mortal into the sacred.\" Ingesting it transforms one’s form and renews the bones, allowing ascent to the heavens—how could the world recognize such a treasure?\n\nWithin the inner elixir of the human body, these two treasures also exist. Yet those of shallow virtue and meager merit, who feel shame in their every movement, can scarcely attain them. Thus, Master Pingshu exhorted those who seek the Dao to cultivate yin merits and yang virtues, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, while also pointing to the path where these treasures are not hard to find: the Four Symbols and Five Phases all depend on Earth, and the Three Primes and Eight Trigrams cannot depart from *ren*. Is this not because Earth gives birth to the Yellow Sprout and *ren* gives birth to White Snow?\n\nEarth resides at the center, its color yellow. Without Earth, the Wood of the Azure Dragon, the Metal of the White Tiger, the Fire of the Vermilion Bird, and the Water of the Dark Warrior cannot fulfill their transformations. Thus, Earth is the master of the Five Phases, nurturing all things. As Immortal Lü said: \"When thunder shakes and rain falls upon the mountain’s peak, it gradually waters the Yellow Sprout as it emerges from the soil.\" *Ren* occupies the position of Water, generated by Metal, its color white and its qi cold. Whether the Three Primes of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, or the Eight Trigrams of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*, none can depart from the Water of *ren*. Water is the mother of the Golden Elixir, and *ren* is the inception of the child—this is the moment when the first yang stirs to form the elixir. An ancient song says: \"To cultivate the Dao, seek the mystery in the Water Palace; when the empty chamber generates whiteness, White Snow arises naturally from *ren*.\"\n\nThose who refine this numinous treasure dissolve all yin demons, and though it is not passed even from father to son, how could the uninitiated recognize it? Profound and unfathomable, it remains inviolable even to ghosts. Yet while some hear that Earth gives birth to the Yellow Sprout and assume it refers to the spleen as central Earth, or that *ren* gives birth to White Snow and take it to mean the kidneys as the Water of *ren*, they fail to realize that the spleen and kidneys are tangible substances—just as cinnabar and mercury are tangible compounds—how could they serve as agents of transformation? The adept refining the elixir must not cling to the spleen and kidneys within, nor abandon mercury and cinnabar without. Know that the Yellow Sprout and White Snow emerge beyond form and substance, existing as \"nonbeing within being, being within nonbeing,\" a mystery within mystery, a wonder beyond wonder—unfathomable and inconceivable.\n\nThe worldly vie for fame and profit, indulging in debauchery, wine, and lust. Even minor practices of ease and joy are neglected, so how could they seek the great Dao’s confidants or the secret formulas of the Golden Elixir? It is a sorrowful difficulty indeed. Every person possesses the medicine of immortality, yet in their folly, they cast it aside. Sweet dew descends only when Heaven and Earth unite; the Yellow Sprout grows only when *Kan* and *Li* intersect. The frog in the well leaps but a few inches in its shallow pool, the sparrow in the hedge flits low among the weeds—how could they know of the dragon’s palace beneath the vast sea or the phoenix’s nest in the towering forests? When the medicine ripens, gold naturally fills the house—why seek herbs to burn as straw?\n\nHeaven and Earth unite their essences to generate all things; man and woman unite their essences to generate humanity. In their ceaseless transformations, from root to origin, there is neither immortal nor mortal, neither noble nor base—all receive a single spark of true yang qi. Thus, the Three Powers stand together, and one may dwell in the world forever. Yet humanity, adrift in the rivers of desire and seas of lust, squanders the essence at the tailbone day and night, indulging in fleeting pleasures without restraint. How pitiful their ignorance, wasting a century’s cultivation of the true! Thus, Master Pingshu took pity on them, saying that the medicine of longevity exists within the human body—sweet dew and the Yellow Sprout are its very substance.\n\nWhen the qi of Heaven descends and the qi of Earth ascends, their harmonious vapors steam together, and sweet dew descends. *Li* receives the Earth of *wu*, *Kan* receives the Earth of *ji*; water and fire circulate and meet at the central Yellow position, and the Yellow Sprout grows. This is no external matter, yet when lesser men hear of the Dao, they surely laugh. Like the frog leaping in a ladle of water or the sparrow flitting low among the weeds, how could they know of the dragon’s palace in the deep sea or the phoenix’s nest in the towering forests? It is not worth reproaching them.\n\nOnly the man of the Dao refines this great medicine, drinking sweet dew in due season and daily gathering the Yellow Sprout. Through the regulation of fire and the addition of time, when the celestial cycles are complete, yang is restored and the bones are renewed. Divine radiance manifests, the golden countenance becomes majestic, and one unites with the Dao in truth. As the Perfected of Yin said: \"When you reach the place of the Yellow Sprout, gold fills my house.\" Why seek herbs to burn as straw to transform external crucible substances?\n\nDiligently seek true lead, lest time slip away too easily.\nCapture the Earth’s *po* to subdue vermilion mercury,\nAnd you will see the Heaven’s *hun* restrain Water-Metal.\nThis may be called: \"The Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;\nVirtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere it.\"\nOnce you know longevity equals Heaven and Earth,\nNo vexations will ever trouble the heart again.\n\nThe great Dao of the Golden Elixir arises from nothing more than lead and mercury, yet no one in the world understands this—why? The Most High said: \"Take lead as the lord, mercury as the minister.\" If lead is not true, mercury will not draw near. An ancient song says: \"Only fear that lead is not true; if lead is true, the medicine forms itself.\" The world often takes lead to be the single spark of yang essence in the northern true qi, yet they do not realize that within it, there is both the true and the vulgar. The true harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth; the vulgar shares its conduct with swine and dogs. Moreover, though lead and mercury are distinct, their root is one. Lead gives birth to mercury, and mercury in turn gives birth to lead—this is the sevenfold reversal of the returning elixir.\n\nWithout diligent inquiry, seeking teachers and visiting friends, and obtaining the golden needle to scrape away the film, one will indeed fritter away life in the fleeting spark of a flint, trapped in birth, aging, sickness, and death. If one knows this, then by mutually restraining the Heaven’s *hun*, Earth’s *po*, golden lead, and fiery mercury, the cultivation of virtue and power becomes possible.\n\nFor the *hun* of Heaven is yang, the sun, fire, and mercury; the *po* of Earth is yin, the moon, water, and lead—all are merely alternate names for lead and mercury.",

      "translated_text": "Yet when Earth’s *po* seizes and restrains fiery mercury, this is yin’s power to control yang. When Heaven’s *hun* subdues watery lead, this is yang’s power to master yin. The alternation of one yin and one yang—this is the Dao; the union of sun and moon—this is the elixir. Then how could the Dao fail to ascend, how could virtue fail to deepen? Though the hidden and the manifest differ in kind, one may yet subdue dragon and tiger, command ghosts and spirits. Thus may one’s lifespan equal Heaven and Earth, transcend the realm of things—what care then for the vexations of the dusty world?\n\nCease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; to seek among the myriad herbs is even further from the truth. When yin and yang find their kindred and return to mutual resonance, when the two eights stand in perfect balance, they naturally unite in affinity. At the depths of the cauldron, the sun glows crimson and yin’s monstrosities vanish; atop the mountain, the moon shines white and the medicinal sprouts renew.\n\nThe Three Yellows are orpiment, realgar, and sulphur; together with mercury and cinnabar, they form the Four Spirits. The \"myriad herbs\" are the drugs of external alchemy. Yet the worldly cannot guard the true and embrace the One, but instead seek outside themselves, inwardly exhausting essence and qi, outwardly ingesting numinous elixirs—this is like ladling boiling water to stop the boil, or carrying firewood to quench the fire: none have ever lived thereby. Not that the elixir lacks efficacy, but that taking it brings no benefit. As Pingshu said: \"Without the true seed within, one but boils an empty cauldron with water and fire.\"\n\nMoreover, the Three Yellows and Four Spirits are what the perfected immortals of the inner elixir employ only after their cultivation is complete, after accumulating merit and virtue, when they weary of the dusty world and wish to dissolve their bonds. Yet how can they abandon the body bequeathed by their parents? For though its essence and blood are foul and putrid, it was born as something wondrous. They must rely on the external elixir to transmute it, to change bones and alter form, to replenish the yang spirit, before they can ride the void and step upon the qi, mount the crane and soar upon the clouds.\n\nNow the common herd, entangled in sensual pleasures, with abundant resources refine the medicine, with depleted vitality seek aid—can this be called \"yin and yang finding their kindred\"? Can this be called \"the two eights standing in balance\"? Only when the inner elixir is achieved does one ingest the external elixir: with one’s own pure yang body, one relies upon that pure yang medicine—this is finding kindred. It is like weighing one’s own half-catty against another’s eight ounces—this is standing in balance. Only then does the sun at the bottom of the pool blaze crimson with radiant light, the moon atop the mountain appear faintly manifest. This is the alternation of floating and sinking, the qi’s channels in mutual resonance. What is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen. Those of this age who would grasp this principle must seek true lead and true mercury, not common cinnabar or quicksilver.\n\n*Commentary on the* Awakening to Reality *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the First, Concluded*\n*Commentary on the* Awakening to Reality *of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll the Second*",

      "translated_text": "The Cloud-Peak Recluse Xia Zongyu of Yongjia wrote:\n\nNot knowing the inversion within the mystery,\nHow can one plant lotus in fire?\nLeading the White Tiger home to nurture,\nIt yields a luminous pearl round as the moon.\n\nIdly tending the elixir furnace, watching the fire’s timing—\nSimply still the spirit and thought, let nature take its course.\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the elixir ripens,\nLeaping beyond the mortal dragon to live ten thousand years.\n\nThe discourse on the wondrous inversion has been detailed before.\n\"Planting lotus in fire,\" though Master Lü [Dongbin] used external matters as metaphor, is in truth the work of internal elixir refinement. Without a teacher’s transmission, scholars vainly labor over annotations. Yet the lotus grows in water, fire arises from wood—how can a water-born thing be planted in fire? This is no principle at all. It is because within the human body there is a thing shaped like a lotus, born of the true yang fire. Though called fire, it is in fact water; though called water, it is in fact fire. Speaking in terms of water, it does not flow to wet nor moisten downward. Speaking in terms of fire, it does not flame upward nor seek dryness. Fire qi concealed in water is called inner yang; water qi concealed in fire is called inner yin. Yin and yang gather essence in water and fire, thus taking form like the lotus. When this lotus is cultivated to maturity, it undergoes a thousand transformations—sometimes sweet as honey, large as a tangerine: this is the lotus. The fruit born on branches, the seed within the womb: this too is the lotus. Even as it becomes *jiaoli* and *huozao*, bearing a thousand names, all are but the manifest virtues of the golden elixir. Only when the lotus is cultivated properly within does its image naturally appear without.\n\nThe White Tiger is metal essence. If one can nurture it at home, preventing its wildness, then the crystalline radiance of metal essence emerges—emptiness gives birth to whiteness, the mysterious pearl takes form, thus round as the moon. Those who refine the elixir know only that the fire’s timing for the external elixir lies in the crucible, not realizing that for the internal elixir, the fire’s timing lies within oneself. The sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire; they did not commit the fire’s timing to writing. Thus Master Lü [Dongbin] instructed one to guard the true and embrace the one, aligning with the transformations of heaven and earth, so that yin and yang ascend and descend naturally, as if matching tally tokens.\n\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the body becomes pure yang—neither born nor destroyed, transcending the realm of things. What cage could confine it? What lifespan could limit it?\n\nTo learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality;\nOnly the golden elixir is most certain.\nWhen the two things meet, emotion and nature unite;\nWhere the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil.\nOriginally through *wu* and *ji* as matchmakers,\nHusband and wife are thus bound in joy.\nAwaiting only the completion of the work to ascend the Jade Palace,\nAmidst ninefold radiance, riding a soaring simurgh.\n\nZhong [Li Quan] and Lü [Dongbin] inquired: Among men, one cultivates to become an immortal; among immortals, one ascends to become celestial. The immortal is one—why then is there a distinction of ascending to heaven? It is because the purely yin without yang is a ghost; the purely yang without yin is an immortal; the mingling of yin and yang is a human. Only humans can become ghosts or immortals. Yet immortals have five ranks: first, celestial immortals; second, spirit immortals; third, earthbound immortals; fourth, ghost immortals; fifth, human immortals.\n\nHow then does one cultivate to become a celestial immortal? Not through methods, not through techniques, not through qi, not through force—only by accumulating virtue and merit to refine the golden elixir. What is the golden elixir? It is nothing more than the union of two things, the perfection of the five phases, attaining long life and enduring vision to become an immortal.\n\nThe Most High said: Dimly, dimly—within it there is a thing. Vaguely, vaguely—within it there is essence. These two things are the sun and moon, the hun and po, the mating of yin and yang. Modeling heaven and emulating its images, at the time of their union, one is moved and thus attains the Dao. The wonder of emotion and nature is what is meant by \"once in thirty days they meet.\" As for the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, earth; heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys—gathering their essential spirits, not using their physical forms, ensuring not one is deficient, yin and yang fully present, naturally the dragon and tiger coil, the spirit becomes mighty. This can repel external demons and guard the great Dao.\n\nTracing to the source, how can the three things unite on their own? How can the five phases perfect themselves? It is only because the earth of *wu* and *ji* sits in the central palace, drawing east and west together, preventing separation. This is what is meant by the union of metal and wood, the mating of water and fire—like husband and wife in joyful union, all through the power of the matchmaker. Cultivating thus within the formless, forming images in the imageless, accumulating days and months, broadly performing hidden merits, mysteriously aligning with heaven and earth, naturally the body returns to pure yang. Ascending in broad daylight, one pays homage to the Jade Emperor in the Golden Portal, rides a colored simurgh through the purple clouds, soars amidst the ninefold radiance, and roams beyond the eight limits.\n\nIs not the ultimate effect of learning immortality indeed the celestial immortal?\n\nTo know where the medicine’s river-source is produced,\nOnly in the southwest is the native land.\nWhen lead sees *gui* born, swiftly gather it;\nWhen metal meets the full moon, it is not yet ripe to taste.\nSend it back to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly,\nThen join it with flowing pearls to pair them.\nThe medicine weighs one catty, requiring two eights;\nAdjust the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"In the southwest one gains companions; in the northeast one loses companions.\" The southwest is the *kun* position, the direction where the sun and moon’s hun and po seek each other. At the end of each month, on the thirtieth day at dawn’s twilight, the moon emerges at *yi*, the sun at *jia*—*jia* and *yi* unite, thus \"in the southwest one gains companions.\" That night, the moon’s brilliance leaves no trace, thus \"in the northeast one loses companions.\" Now Master Lü [Dongbin] says the river-source of the medicine’s production lies only in the southwest—is this not because the moon emerges from *kun*, and the *zhen* trigram first receives it? *Kun* transforms into *zhen*, the moon’s yang hun is newly born, thus able to suspend its image and display its brightness. This is what is meant by \"on the third day *geng* is born, the *dui* gate opens; black silver yields white silver.\"",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, it is said: \"When the moon rises over the mountain’s peak, the medicinal sprout is newly born\"—this is precisely where the river-source of its production lies. Though the moon is the essence and emblem of *Taiyin*, corresponding to metal and water, it in truth steals the sun’s yang radiance to shine. Tracing it to the water born of *Tianyi*, without the lead of metal it cannot be generated; thus when metal flourishes, water is born, and when the moon waxes full, the tide swells high. Now, if one gathers this lead at the time when *gui* is born, it is the mother concealing the child in her womb—if I can gather it for the use of the golden elixir, this is precisely the moment when the solitary yang first stirs to form the elixir. Should metal encounter the distant full moon, then only after the fifteenth day does the moon begin to grow its *po*; this *po* belongs to yin, and from the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the *po* fills while the *hun* wanes, yang declines and yin prevails—such metal is unfit for consumption. Since metal at the distant full moon is unfit, one must swiftly seek the lead born of *gui*, which is the gold within water, and having obtained it, return it to the earthen crucible’s central chamber, pairing it with *liuzhu* and refining it with fire-tending. Seal it tightly to prevent any risk of escape; balance the weights evenly to avoid any excess or deficiency. How then could the golden elixir fail to form?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"Mercury is the sun’s flowing pearl,\nThe Azure Dragon attends it;\nRaising the east to meet the west,\nHun and po naturally bind.\nThe upper crescent counts eight in *dui*,\nThe lower crescent counts eight as well;\nWhen the two crescents join their essence,\nThe body of Qian and Kun is complete.\nTwo eights make one catty—\nThe Dao of Change stands firm and true.\"*\n\nThis perfectly accords with the verse. Do not mistake solitary yin for possessing yang, for cultivating this alone will only lead to emaciation. Exerting the body with postures and stretches is not the Way; refining qi and ingesting mist is sheer madness. The world vainly seeks the subjugation of mercury and gold—when will they ever witness the descent of tiger and dragon? I urge you to thoroughly seek the place of your own birth: returning to the root and restoring the origin is the King of Medicines.\n\nMaster Yunfang’s *Zhixuan Pian* says:\n*\"Tears, sleep-drool, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—\nThese seven have ever belonged to yin.\nIf one takes these as the substance of immortality,\nHow can one’s spirit soar to the Jade Capital?\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—\nWho knows what thing is yang’s essence?\nIf by good fortune you meet a luminous teacher’s guidance,\nThe Dao and immortality are yours in this very moment.\"*\n\nThese poems guide lost learners with such profound clarity! Yet the Buddhists, clinging to vacuity, sit sated and face the wall, believing that cutting off desire and preserving essence and qi can lead to the Dao. I see only their bodies withering, their forms weakening, growing ever more emaciated, until the bell tolls and the water-clock runs dry—at last they become mere ghosts of yin’s good spirits. Even worse are those ignorant Dao-seekers who merely crane their necks like bears or stretch like crows, ingest mist and refine qi, or mistake the heart and kidneys for mercury and gold, the liver and lungs for dragon and tiger—all blind cultivation and reckless refinement, unaware of the true yang’s ancestral source. How then can they return to the root, restore the origin, and attain the great medicine?\n\nThough at the outset of entering the Dao, one closely observes the human body—nothing more than tears, saliva, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids; heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—all nourishing this illusory form, how can one claim they all belong to yin? Beyond these, is there truly no real yang to be found? My heart has long been unsatisfied. For twenty years, Master Yunfang perused the *Daoist Canon*, consulted the Nine Schools, and met countless so-called Daoists—all saying only to swallow saliva and gulp down drool. Yet in all the world, none could resolve this doubt. Even the *Guanyuan Yuan Dadao Ge* merely states that this thing originally has no fixed position, transforming with the mind’s intent: in the body, when feeling heat it becomes sweat; in the nose, when struck by wind it becomes mucus; in the kidneys, when aroused it becomes essence; in the eyes, when grieved it becomes tears—still not revealing what true yang truly is. The *Taishang Qibao Wulou Jing* likewise says: \"To nourish the spirit, first nourish qi; to nourish qi, first nourish tears; to nourish tears, first nourish mucus; to nourish mucus, first nourish saliva; to nourish saliva, first nourish blood; to nourish blood, first nourish essence; to nourish essence, first nourish fluids; to nourish fluids, first nourish water.\" Water is the flower-pool’s saliva, the essence of primordial qi, found in the tongue’s cavity—yet it still does not speak of the reality of yang essence. This only deepens confusion, leaving one’s heart and mind bewildered, as if questioning ghosts and spirits without resolution.\n\nThose who cultivate this alone indeed grow frail: some hearts restless and vexed, some loins heavy and stiff, some dreamless yet leaking. With guiding and breathing, day and night, they may briefly recover, but if interrupted by busyness, a hundred illnesses assail them, and medicines are taken in vain—not only futile, but gravely harmful. Onlookers secretly mock, fellow Daoists lose heart and retreat. Only my foolish self remains unshaken, my faith in the Dao ever firmer. I say: can the sagely worthies of old, who bequeathed teachings to the world, have erred in misleading later generations? It is only that my own practice is not steadfast, my teacher’s transmission not true. Resolutely, I cast off the cage, traversed famous mountains and grottoes, silently prayed to the unseen, seeking to fathom the mystery’s pointer. Suddenly, at Dragon-Tiger Mountain, I first received an auspicious dream; then on Zhurong Peak, I encountered a sagely teacher—its details are fully recorded in *The Full Account of My Encounter with the Immortal*. At last, I obtained the secret of true yang, which can subdue the four great yin elements of the body—neither essence nor qi, neither kidney nor heart, neither tears nor saliva, neither blood nor fluids.\n\nThe place of this thing’s birth precedes heaven and earth; the place of its dissolution precedes heaven and earth’s end. The five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—converge here; the five viscera—heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—concentrate their numen here; the seven substances—tears, saliva, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—crystallize their excellence here. In its vastness, even heaven and earth can contain it.",

      "translated_text": "The *Cantong Qi* states: On the third day, the moon emerges as \"scouring brightness,\" with Zhen receiving Geng in the western direction. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, establishing its foundation through the mother. As Master Pingshu says: On the third day, Geng is born and Zhen’s gate opens—this is the black-silver furnace yielding white silver. Kun transforms a second time to become Dui, and Dui governs the moon’s emergence on the eighth day in Ding’s domain. Dui governs the six Ding, corresponding to Dui’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: On the eighth day, the moon emerges in Ding, its upper arc weighing half a catty of metal. The *Cantong Qi* states: Dui receives Ding’s tally, its upper arc straight as a plumb line. As Pingshu says: When the moon first appears at the sky’s edge as a half-wheel, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound.\n\nKun transforms a third time to become Qian, and Qian governs the moon’s emergence on the fifteenth day in Jia’s domain. Qian governs the six Jia, corresponding to Qian’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: On the fifteenth day, the three yang are complete, round and illuminating Jia in the east. Metal and water warm the great yang, red marrow flows as mercury, and the maidens play in the radiant moonlight. The *Cantong Qi* states: When the three and five virtues are complete, Qian’s body is fully formed. That night, the moon’s brilliance is full, and the great yin shines brightly. Yet it is not yin’s power that illuminates—it is the true yang at its zenith. However, when yang flourishes, it must strike yin, and when things reach their extreme, they revert to their origin. Waxing and waning, growth and decline—such is the natural principle of heaven. The *Upper Classic* says: When the moon waxes to its fullness, it must wane. On the sixteenth day, it begins to diminish, as Qian’s yang line is broken to form Xun. At dawn, the moon aligns with Xin. From the sixteenth day onward, the moon emerges in Xin’s domain, as Qian’s first reduction forms Xun. Xun governs the six Xin, corresponding to Xun’s hexagram. At this time, the moon’s light returns to the sun, and the yang line must wane. The *Cantong Qi* states: The divine tally wanes and breaks, its flourishing and decline gradually transforming, ultimately returning to its origin, with Xun inheriting its mandate.\n\nFrom the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth day, the moon emerges in Bing’s southern domain, as Qian’s second reduction forms Gen. Gen governs the six Bing, corresponding to Gen’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: Qian’s second reduction forms Gen, and on the twenty-third day, the lower arc weighs half a catty of water. The *Cantong Qi* states: Gen governs advance and retreat, not overstepping its time. From the twenty-sixth to the thirtieth day, the moon emerges in Yi’s domain, as Qian’s third reduction forms Kun. Kun governs the six Yi, corresponding to Kun’s hexagram. The *Upper Classic* says: Qian’s third transformation forms Kun, and on the thirtieth day, Kun-Yi loses its companion in the northeast. The moon sets in Yi-Kun, and as Yi-Kun’s moon wanes, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform. Following Kun, Zhen’s dragon is born, and Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end. The *Cantong Qi* states: The five and six of Kun’s succession bind the beginning and end. This is the return to the origin, the alternation of yin and yang—its Dao is greatly luminous, its function inexhaustible. It is called the union of heaven and earth, the conjunction of sun and moon. It is called Qian’s three searches giving birth to three sons, and Kun’s three searches giving birth to three daughters. Male and female intermingle, yin and yang pair—is this not relying on Kun’s position to form the body, planting the seed in Qian’s domain to stir the senses?\n\nAlas! The sun is heaven’s hun-soul, the blood and marrow of the great Dao. The moon is earth’s po-soul, the essence and qi of the great Dao. The great Dao does not lose its sun and moon, and so endures for kalpas without end. The human body does not lose its sun and moon, and so attains deathlessness and eternal life. Yet scholars are deluded, their natural endowments dull. Worse still, some take the false as the norm, wine as their drink, and the six desires and seven emotions sever their original true nature. They become walking corpses, phoenixes in flight—far removed from the human Dao. How can they partake in the way of the three powers standing as one?\n\nNow, Pingshu has revealed the celestial mechanism, directly pointing to the mysterious pass and essential path. One who comprehends this profound meaning will find that the august Three Pure Ones are not distant from oneself. As the saying goes: \"One attainment is eternal attainment,\" and one immediately ascends to the sacred rank. This principle is most profound and wondrous. Without innate spiritual bone and unwavering resolve to cultivate the Dao, even if one encounters a sage-teacher, they will often miss the mark. Scholars, take heed!\n\nWithout recognizing true lead and the correct lineage,\nAll efforts are in vain, labor wasted.\nDismissing one’s wife only severs yin and yang,\nFasting merely empties the stomach and bowels.\nHerbs, metals, gold, and silver are but coarse matter,\nClouds, mist, sun, and moon remain obscure.\nEven with breath control and visualization,\nNone compare to the work of the golden elixir.\n\nThe path of cultivation prioritizes restraint of desire—does this poem encourage indulgence? No. The great Dao is non-action, while side paths involve much ado. People mistakenly believe that avoiding women, abstaining from cooked food, refining elixirs, consuming mist, practicing breath control, or visualizing the kidneys and heart encompass the Dao’s profound mysteries. Yet forced restraint does not arise from nature, and deliberate action is not free from delusion. Moreover, lead has the true and the ordinary, the ancestral and the secondary—truly not easy to discern. If one receives transmission from a teacher, the Dao is present at a glance, and the radiant golden elixir forms in a single day. Without such guidance, blind practice and haphazard refinement may bring comfort and longevity, slightly better than those who recklessly abandon life and lose their origin. Yet they remain unrelated to the great path of the golden elixir.\n\nAlthough the Heavenly Master lineage has endured thirty-six generations, and Master Xu Jingshan’s family has over forty members ascending in broad daylight, or Liu An the Prince and Liu Gang practicing dual cultivation with their wives, or Wei Boyang having a son in official service—none attained the Dao by dismissing wives or fasting. There is no other reason: some achieved the Dao in boyhood, others cultivated after marriage. All progressed through inner practice and accumulating hidden virtue, advancing from the lesser vehicle to the middle vehicle, and from the middle to the greater vehicle. None attained the great Dao in a single leap.",

correspond to the sixty-four hexagrams:\n\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,\nThen use the Crow and Hare to boil the medicine.\nIf you can drive these two things into the Yellow Path,\nHow could the Yellow Sprout fail to grow?\n\nQian is Heaven, Kun is Earth.\nQian is yang, Kun is yin.\nHeaven’s yang is above, Earth’s yin is below.\nOnce above and below are fixed, the form of the crucible and vessel is complete.\n\nThe Crow is the sun, the Hare is the moon.\nThe sun is yang, the moon is yin.\nThe sun’s yang arises in the east, the moon’s yin arises in the west.\nOnce east and west are divided, the medicines must be kept apart.\n\nThe Yellow Path is the central, correct position of the Five Phases.\nThe Yellow Sprout is the numinous shoot of the Golden Elixir.\nIf Heaven and Earth use Qian and Kun as crucible and vessel,\nHow could the crucible and vessel of our bodies fail to embody the function of Qian and Kun?\nIf Heaven and Earth use the Crow and Hare as medicines,\nHow could the medicines of our bodies not refine the essence of the Crow and Hare?\n\nYet there are crucibles of both the *Already Achieved* and the *Not Yet Achieved*,\nNeither of which can neglect the work of water and fire.\nThus, the refining of metal depends on water and fire,\nBut water and fire cannot sustain themselves—\nThey must rely on the virtue of Earth to complete the work.\nWithout *wu* and *ji*, the Elixir cannot form.\nIf one can daily refine and hourly boil,\nDriving the two things into the central palace of the True Earth,\nThen the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir will sprout and grow,\nDaily receiving the harmonious qi of the eastern wind until it reaches the state of pure yang.\nWhat is called \"the flower of the heart blooming in clarity, the fruit of the Dao perfected,\"\nLarge as an orange and sweet as honey—\nAll arises from the flourishing of this Yellow Sprout.\n\nThe method of setting up the furnace and establishing the crucible follows Qian and Kun,\nTempering the essence to govern the *po* and *hun*.\nGathering and dispersing, misty and swirling, they form transformations—\nHow dare one presume to speak of fixed forms in advance?\n\nThe furnace is set up externally, the crucible established internally.\nThough the model lies in the vessel, its essence is the body of Qian and Kun.\nThus, borrowing this crucible and vessel to refine the medicines,\nThe sun’s essence, the moon’s radiance, the sun’s *hun*, the moon’s *po*—\nThese two things gather and disperse, their qi misty and swirling, forming transformations,\nSo that the Golden Elixir may be achieved.\nHow dare one presume to speak of fixed forms?\nFor the spirit has no fixed form, and the *Yi* has no fixed body—\nThis is the mystery within mystery, the subtlety within subtlety,\nNot a matter of learning through words or ears.\n\nThe workings of the inner and outer Elixirs share this formless, bodiless wonder,\nBeyond thought, beyond description.\nIf the scholar has the affinity,\nThen through heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction,\nOnce attained, it is attained forever.\nWithout relying on written words,\nIt directly points to the mystery of the supreme vehicle,\nAscending to sagehood and attaining immortality in an instant.\n\nDo not cling to the elixir furnace and waste effort—\nTo refine the medicine, seek the Reclining Moon Furnace.\nIt naturally possesses the true fire of Heaven’s nurturing,\nWith no need for firewood, charcoal, or blowing.\n\nThe Dao of the Elixir runs deep.\nThere is the inner Elixir and the outer Elixir.\nThe inner Elixir refines the radiance of the sun and moon,\nGathers the true spirit of the original spirit—\nThis is returning to the root and reverting to the origin, the supreme Dao.\nThe outer Elixir takes true lead and true mercury,\nAdjusts the fire times, adds and withdraws,\nTo form the medicine of long life.\nIf one has the inner Elixir but not the outer,\nThough the Dao may be attained, the physical body remains heavy,\nUnable to escape cold and heat, and cannot ascend in flight.\nOne must obtain the outer Elixir to transform the physical form,\nSo that the foul and rotten may give birth to the divine and wondrous.\nIf one has the outer Elixir but not the inner,\nIt is like \"boiling an empty pot with water and fire when there is no true seed within\"—\nThe divine and wondrous will revert to the foul and rotten.\n\nMaster Pingshu’s poem does not mean to entirely reject the outer Elixir,\nBut pities that the world knows only the outer and not the inner,\nSo he uses the metaphor of firewood, charcoal, and the elixir furnace to enlighten them.\nThe Reclining Moon Furnace is the vessel for refining the Elixir within the human body,\nIts shape like the moon’s first crescent.\nIt naturally possesses the true fire of yang,\nNurtured by the four seasons, illuminating Heaven and Earth,\nThus requiring no firewood, charcoal, or blowing.\nAs for the refining of the outer Elixir, these cannot be dispensed with—\nThis is merely speaking in reverse.\n\nIn the Reclining Moon Furnace, the Jade Medicine grows;\nIn the Cinnabar Crucible, the mercury levels.\nOnly after the fire force is harmonized,\nDoes the Yellow Sprout gradually mature.\n\nThe workings of the inner and outer Elixirs are the same:\nSetting up the furnace, establishing the crucible,\nRefining cinnabar and mercury—\nAll rely on water and fire as the foundation.\nFor fire can generate Earth, Earth can generate Metal,\nAnd the Yellow Sprout is the numinous shoot of the Golden Elixir.\nThis refers to the crucible and medicines of the outer Elixir,\nTo illustrate the crucible and medicines of our bodies.\n\nSome mistakenly take the Reclining Moon Furnace as the shape of the inner kidneys,\nOr the Cinnabar Crucible as the symbol of the red heart—\nBoth are wrong.\nOthers take the Jade Medicine and mercury as the essence and fluids—\nThese are also incorrect.\nThough the furnace resembles the Reclining Moon\nAnd the crucible uses cinnabar,\nThough their symbolic forms differ,\nThey are in truth the same vessel for refining the Golden Elixir within the human body.\nThough the Jade Medicine and mercury are differently named,\nThey are in truth the same mother of the Golden Elixir within the human body.\nIf one can skillfully add and withdraw, advance and retreat the fire,\nAscending and descending in accord with Heaven and Earth,\nUniting like the sun and moon,\nWith the fire times harmonized without the slightest error,\nNaturally the Yellow Sprout will sprout and flourish,\nAuspicious qi will swirl and gather,\nThe Golden Elixir will form as treasure,\nAnd one will be coeval with Heaven and Earth.\n\nSwallowing fluids and absorbing qi is what humans do,\nBut only with the right substance can the myriad things be born.\n\"If there is no true seed within,\nIt is like boiling an empty pot with water and fire.\"\n\nFluids are water, qi is fire.\nIn the human body, fluids moisten it, qi moves it—\nWater and fire nurture each other, enabling long life.\nBut when desires and cravings flourish,\nExhausting the original source of water and fire,\nThe true essence is depleted—\nLike a tree without roots,\nThough it may be touched by rain and dew, it cannot stand on its own.",

It is like using original essence to replenish original *qi*,\nOr original *qi* to replenish original spirit—\nAll follow the natural path of resonance,\nUsing true yang to gather constant yin.\nIf one employs common lead or mismatched substances,\nIt is labor in vain.\n\nDo not use common lead—use true lead,\nAnd when true lead has served its purpose, discard it.\nThis is the true and wondrous secret of using lead:\n*\"Use lead, yet do not use it\"* is the sincere teaching.\n\nThe ancient immortals said:\n*\"Foxes and hares do not nurse horses,\nSwallows and sparrows do not hatch phoenixes.\nPlant millet to grow millet,\nRefine gold only with gold.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Lead is the mother of the sprout,\nThe sprout is the child of lead.\nOnce the golden flower is obtained,\nDiscard the lead and do not employ it.\"*\nThus we know:\nLead mothers differ in true and common,\nTheir use differs in sequence.\nTo nurture the child, one must first use true lead to lay the Elixir’s foundation.\nWhen the child matures into a village,\nThe lead mother must be cast aside to stand alone.\nThe ancient song of the Elixir’s secret says:\n*\"Nurture the child into a dragon, proud and lofty,\nThen despise the original mother as vulgar and clamorous.\"*\nThis speaks of external alchemy,\nBut scholars should grasp its application to internal alchemy.\nFor instance:\nGuarding the heart, contemplating the kidneys, treasuring *qi*, refining essence—\nAll embody the intent of using lead.\nYet when attaining the supreme, effortless Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,\nThe heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys,\nEssence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humor—\nAll must be set aside.\nThus *\"use lead, yet do not use it\"* is the sincere teaching.\n\nTo empty the heart and fill the abdomen—both meanings run deep,\nBut emptying the heart is to know the heart.\nBetter to first fill the abdomen by refining lead,\nThen guard the teaching and keep the hall filled with gold.\n\nA heart emptied is unstained by a single speck of dust—\nThus it can nurture the nature.",

      "translated_text": "Now again, earth can generate metal, its creative transformations boundless—thus the Metal Elder is called the Old Husband. As the *Cantong Qi* says, \"Lofty and revered is he.\"\n\nThough one may recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the firing times, it is as idle as nothing. In all things, cultivation’s power is paramount; the slightest deviation will fail to produce the elixir.\n\nThe Great Way of the Golden Elixir involves nothing more than lead and mercury. Lead arises in the North, the true essence of Heaven’s One generating water. Mercury emerges in the South, the wondrous work of Earth’s Two generating fire. Most true, most wondrous—no external borrowing, only the original face, which the common folk use daily yet do not recognize.\n\nIt is not the heart and kidneys, not *kan* and *li*, not the water and fire of the human realm, not common lead or common mercury. If one is blessed with innate spiritual bones, grasps the meaning through texts, and pierces the nature of cinnabar and lead, one has already obtained the ingredients for the Golden Elixir. Yet how can this medicine, so numinous, be refined? For example, lead, tin, and quicksilver flee at the sight of fire—how then can the elixir be formed?\n\nWithout knowing the firing times, even recognizing cinnabar and lead is of no benefit. For fire is fire, and timing is timing—scholars who conflate the two err. Speaking of external alchemy, there is civil fire and martial fire, inserted fire and lodged fire, celestial fire and the fires of the four cardinal directions, the fire of *jiji* and the fire of *weiji*—no different from the fires of internal alchemy.\n\nFive days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*, seventy-two *hou* make a year—this is the timing of a full year. From *hai* to *zi* is the yin crossing into yang; from *si* to *wu* is the yang crossing into yin—this is the timing of a single day. When *zi* and *chou* meet, it is the yang crossing into yin; when *chou* and *yin* meet, it is the yin crossing into yang—this is the timing of a single hour. No different from the timing of internal alchemy.\n\nThus Pengzu said: Though the world may recognize the true nature of cinnabar and lead, they have merely obtained the ingredients for the Golden Elixir. Without understanding the secret of firing times, it is all in vain. One must cultivate with utmost sincerity, without the slightest misstep in timing—only then will the Golden Elixir be achieved. Otherwise, blind practice and reckless refinement, lacking proper transmission, will lead even the smallest error to distance one from the Golden Elixir.\n\nThe sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; they do not commit the firing times to writing. As the *Cantong Qi* and other elixir scriptures, songs, and poems expound the truth in exhaustive detail, yet the matter of firing times is never plainly stated in the texts—one must encounter a true master for oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction to attain it once and for all. The supreme Way is not complex, yet fire is fire, and timing is timing—how can the world, in its ignorance, comprehend?\n\nThough fire and timing are two matters, they share a single principle. Though a single principle, they serve two functions. Without the oral instructions, how can one penetrate the mystery? Even if your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true teacher, do not presume to guess—thus one must discuss it in detail with the immortals.\n\nOn the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—\nThis is precisely when the metal essence is at its peak.\nWhen the first yang stirs in revival,\nBegin the firing without delay.\n\nThe fifteenth of the eighth month marks the midpoint of autumn, when the metal qi is at its height, corresponding to the *dui* trigram. Practitioners of the truth must pay heed at this time. When the first yang revives, the trigram becomes *fu*, the time of the winter solstice—then one must apply effort and begin the firing, without procrastination, lest the moment be lost.\n\nThough Pengzu used this metaphor to illustrate the principle of metal generating water, it does not mean one must wait for the eighth and eleventh months each year to refine the elixir, while the rest of the months are unusable—this is not the case. For within a single day, there is the autumnal peak of metal essence and the winter solstice of yang’s revival. Moreover, yang is born in *kan*, which belongs to water. How can water generate itself? It must be generated by metal. Metal reaches its imperial vigor in *you*—the eighth month. Water reaches its imperial vigor in *zi*—the eleventh month. This is the gathering of years into months, months into days, and days into hours.\n\nWhen the first yang stirs at the time of elixir-making,\nThe lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the curtains.\nAt the moment of receiving qi, it is easily obtained—\nBut in the work of drawing and adding, beware of danger.\n\nThe human body shares the same yin and yang as heaven and earth, with yang qi ascending daily from midnight at the *zi* hour and yin qi descending from noon at the *wu* hour. Those who cultivate the truth must activate the celestial mechanism at this time, aligning it precisely—without the slightest deviation, the Way of the Elixir will be achieved.\n\nThe \"lead cauldron\" is the vessel for refining the elixir within the human body. The \"curtains\" refer to the principle of sealing the *dui* trigram and lowering the veil, as well as Lü Dongbin’s light penetrating the curtains. Thus Pengzu cited these to say: when the first yang arises at the *zi* hour, it is the beginning of receiving qi, the time to make the elixir. If one misses this moment, there will be peril to guard against.",

By the tenth month, frost flies and the elixir ripens—at this moment, when taken into the mouth, even ghosts and spirits are startled.\n\nThat which grows loftier the more one looks up, harder the more one drills, appears before the eyes yet suddenly behind—this is the Confucian Mysterious Pearl taking form. Round and luminous, radiant and bright, clear and vivid, lively and fluid—this is the Buddhist Mysterious Pearl taking form. The numinous luminous treasury, illuminating heaven and earth, a single point of true suchness, the empty chamber generating brightness—this is the Daoist Mysterious Pearl taking form.\n\nThough the Three Teachings differ, the Great Dao is one. Yet the Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth; the Yellow Emperor’s lost pearl was grasped by the formless. Now it is said the Mysterious Pearl has form—why? Because the Great Dao enters existence from non-being, its form naturally manifests. Thus the image of a single wheel appearing in the deep pool is this form. The True Person emerging of itself is also this form. Called the Mysterious Pearl or Golden Elixir, these are all forms within form, arriving without seeking.\n\nProfound indeed, wondrous indeed—this form can be and not be, can conceal and reveal. When yang begins to rise, the Mysterious Pearl takes form; when the time of yin’s birth arrives, the Mysterious Pearl loses form. Thus it appears at the inception of yang’s peak and vanishes after yin’s extremity. In the *Fu* hexagram, the first yang is born at *zi*, and the Mysterious Pearl takes form. In the *Bo* hexagram, the six yins reach their extreme at *hai*, and the Mysterious Pearl loses form.\n\nYet only after ten months does the elixir ripen—this is the time when frost flies in biting cold, when the myriad things return to their roots and renew their lives, when yin reaches its limit and yang is born, when the celestial cycle is complete. Only then does the elixir congeal. Thus it is as large as a tangerine, as sweet as honey, the exchanged pear, the fiery jujube—swallowed or spat out like a dragon’s chin pearl, like the ox’s yellow. Lü Dongbin spoke of drinking the *daogui* at that time, for then one’s virtue commands the reverence of ghosts and spirits—how could it not astonish them when taken into the mouth?\n\nAfter the first crescent and before the last, the medicine’s flavor is mild and its qi complete. Gather it and return to refine it in the furnace; once tempered, nurture it through gentle warming and self-cultivation.",
      "overlap_context": "the slightest deviation, the Way of the Elixir will be achieved.\n\nThe \"lead cauldron\" is the vessel for refining the elixir within the human body. The \"curtains\" refer to the principle of sealing the *dui* trigram and lowering the veil, as well as Lü Dongbin’s light penetrating the curtains. Thus Pengzu cited these to say: when the first yang arises at the *zi* hour, it is the beginning of receiving qi, the time to make the elixir. If one misses this moment, there will be peril to guard against.",

      "translated_text": "The first crescent refers to the waxing moon of the seventh or eighth day of the lunar month. The last crescent refers to the waning moon of the twenty-second or twenty-third day. What is meant by \"crescent\"? When the moon first waxes or begins to wane, its shape is half, like the drawn bow of the upper string. At this time, the elixir’s essence is clear and pure, the golden essence robust and flourishing, its flavor mild, and its qi fully manifested. Those who cultivate the Dao must emulate the heavens and model their forms, gathering the golden and watery qi of their own bodies to refine in the spiritual furnace. Through the regulation of fire and the addition or withdrawal of heat, they nurture and temper it, neither losing the balance of water and fire. Thus the golden elixir is achieved—what else need one seek?\n\nThe eldest son first drinks the wine of the West,\nThe youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North.\nIf the Green Maiden meets them thereafter,\nAll will be sealed within the Yellow House.\n\nThe eldest son is *Zhen* (☳). The youngest daughter is *Dui* (☱). *Zhen* pertains to wood, *Dui* to metal. The \"wine of the West\" refers to the West as the direction of metal, and wine as the symbol of water—an analogy for metal giving birth to water. The \"flower of the North\" refers to the North as the direction of *Kan* water, and the flower as the bloom of lead—an analogy for lead within water. The \"Green Maiden\" is the green maiden, the wood-mercury. The \"Yellow House\" is the Yellow Dame, the central palace. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Cinnabar is the essence of wood; only when it meets metal do they unite.\" The great Dao takes mutual restraint as its subtlety; metal and wood must not be allowed to separate. If not sealed within the central palace, *Zhen* in the East and *Dui* in the West would have no means of transformation. For wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness, and metal’s essence yearns for wood’s benevolence. Only through mutual absorption and consumption do they become intimate, necessarily borrowing the central palace’s earth to complete the work of creation.\n\nWhen the months of the Hare and the Rooster arrive at their time,\nPunishment and virtue stand at the gate, mirroring the medicine’s form.\nAt this point, the golden cinnabar must be bathed;\nIf fire is added further, peril and collapse will follow.\n\nThings at their extreme must reverse—this is the principle and the natural tendency. Thus, in *Qian*’s topmost yang line, the pure yang reaches its limit, and the sage warns of the \"arrogant dragon’s regret.\" Moreover, metal is born in *Si* (☶) and flourishes in *You* (☰). Wood is born in *Hai* (☳) and flourishes in *Mao* (☷). The Hare is *Mao*’s wood; the Rooster is *You*’s metal. Metal governs punishment; wood governs virtue. \"Punishment and virtue stand at the gate\" refers to *Mao* and *You* as the gates of the second and eighth months, the paths of the sun and moon’s entry and exit, the division of yin and yang, day and night. Since the great Dao takes yin and yang, the sun and moon as its foundation, when it reaches the places of *Mao* and *You*’s extreme flourishing, one must bathe, concentrating the qi to achieve softness, acting without striving, and embracing tranquility. Thus the harmonious primordial yang fills the space between heaven and earth, and this heart has no outward attachment, naturally merging with the Great Void. As it is said: \"When the hundred bones are all governed by true non-action, one must not add scorching fire, lest the medicine escape and peril ensue.\" This is precisely the principle of regulating fire to prevent danger.\n\nThe sun and moon meet once every thirty days,\nExchanging days for hours, the method of divine work.\nDefending the city or waging wild battle, know fortune and misfortune;\nAdding numinous cinnabar, the cauldron fills with red.\n\nHeaven and earth rely on the sun and moon for their work, illuminating the myriad forms without cease, day and night. They must meet at the new moon every thirty days, cycling endlessly without termination. The great Dao employs the golden elixir, refining the crow and smelting the hare, subduing the dragon and taming the tiger. Emulating heaven and modeling its forms, it exchanges hours for days to seize the creative power of heaven and earth, just as the sun and moon unite as one. Thus one attains longevity and avoids death. Yet gathering years into months, months into days, and days into hours, one must firmly guard the city walls, battle and repel demonic obstacles, refrain from idle thoughts, and remain unmoved by desire. Naturally, fortune will come without misfortune. For victory brings fortune, and defeat brings misfortune; fortune brings life, and misfortune brings death. If every battle is won, fortune will be everlasting, and misfortune will vanish. Thus the priceless treasure resides within one’s own body. Like nine-times-refined numinous cinnabar, accumulated day by day and month by month, its red light will penetrate through, moving heaven and earth and startling ghosts and spirits.\n\nWhen *Pi* and *Tai* first meet, the myriad things flourish;\n*Zhun* and *Meng* receive their hexagrams, endowed with life and completion.\nWithin this, grasp the meaning and do not seek images;\nIf you exhaust the lines, you will be enslaved by toil.\n\nWhen heaven and earth unite, it is *Tai*; when they do not, it is *Pi*. The meaning of *Tai* is the image of *Jiji* and *Weiji*. *Zhun* (Water Thunder) teaches the noble one to order and weave; the spring beneath the mountain is *Meng*, teaching the noble one to act resolutely and cultivate virtue. The meanings of *Zhun* and *Meng* represent the initial growth of yin and yang, the very time for cultivating the true and nurturing the essence. Yet those who seek the golden elixir are confused by the regulation of fire, bewildered by the timing of the furnace, and thus apply the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines as their method, wasting years in vain labor, their hair turning white without achievement. Thus Master Pingshu said: \"When heaven and earth first unite, the myriad things flourish. At the initial arising of *Zhun* and *Meng*, one must preserve and nurture the primordial spirit, just as in the time of *Zhun*’s difficulties and *Meng*’s youth, not allowing the slightest external use of the mind. Naturally, one advances in the Dao, and the myriad things of heaven and earth are all contained within the self. How can this not be fulfilling? Why cling to images and numbers, only to be enslaved by the lines?\"\n\nHexagrams set forth images to model forms,\nGrasp the meaning, forget the words, and the intent will be clear.\nLater generations, deluded, cling only to images,\nPracticing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending in flight.\n\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate divided, there was a thing formed in chaos—what hexagram image could there be? Only after heaven and earth separated and *Qian* and *Kun* were established did the sages set forth images and draw hexagrams, merely using the sun and moon as the *Yi*. Its purport is profound and subtle; the great Dao lies herein. Yet later scholars, not understanding, cling only to images and practice hexagram qi, using *Zhun* in the morning and *Meng* at night, *Xu* in the morning and *Song* at dusk, dividing the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines into thirty days, while *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are left unused. Or, in twenty-nine days, they employ other methods to supplement the hexagrams.",

      "translated_text": "Such practices are truly absurd and self-inflicted toil. How can one employ the hexagram *Zhun* (Water-Thunder) in the morning and claim its efficacy when its image is *Zhun*? How can one employ *Meng* (Mountain-Water) at night and claim its efficacy when its image is *Meng*? As for *Xu* (Water-Heaven) and *Song* (Heaven-Water), what method or standard exists to embody their forms? Yet deluded fools lead one another astray, corrupting the great Dao, and still hope to ascend in flight—how utterly foolish and misguided!\n\nHeaven and earth wax and wane in their own time; only by discerning their ebb and flow can one grasp the subtle mechanism. Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* days have enforced the celestial decree, and when the Three Worms are slain, the Dao may be attained. Though heaven and earth are vast, the Dao has its waxing and waning. The great Dao is profound and subtle, its mechanism linked to ebb and flow—this is no mere delusion or idle fantasy.\n\nThe human body mirrors heaven and earth; every principle of waxing and waning, ebb and flow, is no different from that of heaven. Thus, at midnight, yang begins to rise; after noon, yin descends. The *geng* precedes the *jia*, their commands strict and clear, so that clarity and brightness reside within, and the spirit’s resolve is as divine. Yet the Three Worms and yin demons disrupt one’s true nature, disorder the blood and qi, and invert deluded thoughts—what place does the Dao have in this? Only by returning from the perverse to the upright, enforcing the *geng* and *jia*, and ensuring the timely interaction of metal and wood, can one grasp the subtle mechanism of ebb and flow, respond to the natural in silence, and slay the Three Worms—then the Dao may be attained.\n\nTo keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation. Once yang essence returns to the Golden Chamber, a single luminous pearl will forever illumine the six directions, merging with heaven and earth as one.\n\nThe Most High said: \"The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female.\" The *Spiritual Pivot* states: \"The spirit of the empty valley, when guarded, remains true.\" For the valley is utter emptiness, and the spirit is utmost numinosity. Emptiness enables perfect responsiveness; numinosity enables transformation. This is the way of long life and enduring vision—hence it is called the Valley Spirit, the Spirit Chamber, the Numinous Treasure Repository, the Crystal Palace, the Primordial Yang Temple, or the Great Unity Crucible, all of which are the sites of golden elixir refinement.\n\nYet the Dao is called the interplay of yin and yang, and the elixir is called the union of the Mysterious and the Female. Before the Primordial Chaos divided, there was a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Once the Supreme Ultimate separated, the Two Modes took their places, and the Mysterious Female was established. Now, to keep the Valley Spirit undying and achieve long life and enduring vision, one must rely on the Mysterious and the Female as the foundation, refining and tempering daily, so that yin evil is consumed and yang essence alone remains whole, returning to the Golden Chamber in the Central Palace. Then a single luminous pearl will radiate through the six directions, completing the union with heaven and earth.\n\nThe gateway of the Mysterious Female is rarely known; do not mistakenly apply it to the mouth and nose. Though you may practice breath regulation for a thousand years, how can you seize the Golden Crow and the Jade Hare?\n\nThe Most High said: \"The gateway of the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth.\" Its meaning is profoundly subtle—how could ordinary people easily comprehend it? Precisely because it is rarely known, some take the nose as the Heavenly Gate, calling it the Mysterious, and the mouth as the Earthly Door, calling it the Female. They exhale the old and inhale the new, taking in more and expelling less, ceaselessly day and night, believing this is the way to attain the Dao. Yet this is merely a method of guiding qi for ease and comfort. Even if practiced for a thousand years, what does it have to do with the great Dao of the golden elixir? Only by causing the Golden Crow and Jade Hare to dance at the gateway of the Mysterious Female, returning to the origin of yin and yang, merging the Two Modes into one, and restoring primordial simplicity, can the sun and moon unite to form the elixir—this is what is meant by \"joining virtue with heaven and earth, merging brightness with the sun and moon.\"\n\nDifferent names emerge from the same source, yet few know that these two are the subtlest of mechanisms. Preserve nature and complete form by understanding waxing and waning; the Purple Gold True Medicine is wondrous indeed. The Dao is called the interplay of yin and yang, and the elixir is called the union of lead and mercury. Though their names differ, their essence is the same. Their number is two, but their body is one. Few know this, so they fail to grasp the subtlety within subtlety, the mechanism within the essential. If one truly understands, then preserving nature and completing form, clarifying the principles of waxing and waning—what is the tally of fire’s retreat? What is the marker of fire’s advance? Each retreat and advance mirrors the waxing and waning of heaven and earth. When the qi and markers of waxing and waning are unerring, the medicine becomes wondrous beyond imagination. This is called the Purple Gold Elixir, the Numinous Treasure Repository.\n\nAt first, when effort is made, few perceive it; only when it becomes effortless do the many recognize it. Yet they see only effortlessness as the essential marvel, unaware that effort is the foundation. The great Dao is effortless, fundamentally the wonder of spontaneity. Heaven says nothing, yet the four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born—such is its principle. How much more so the profound mystery of the golden elixir, which cannot be sought through intellect or force, nor grasped through form or substance. If called \"being,\" it cannot be met when pursued, nor seen when followed. If called \"non-being,\" it is dim and indistinct, yet within it lies something; it is obscure and profound, yet within it lies essence. Thus, when effort is made, few perceive it, but when it becomes effortless, the many recognize it. This creates a distinction between superior and inferior, with effortlessness deemed the essential marvel. Yet how can they know that effortlessness is the fundamental nature of the Dao, while effort is its foundation? This is not to say that clinging to images and texts, or toiling like a well-sweep, constitutes effort. Nor is it to say that sitting in solitary stillness, like withered wood or dead ashes, constitutes effortlessness.\n\nThe highest good is like water, flowing where there is no strife. The supreme Dao is unburdensome, attaining what is inherently possessed. Effortlessness rests in spontaneity, while effort also proceeds spontaneously.\n\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Four Concludes*\n*Commentary on the \"Awakening to Reality\" by the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Volume Five*",

      "translated_text": "Gazing, one sees not its color; listening, one hears not its sound; grasping, one cannot seize its form—such is the state of the elusive and indistinct, the profound and unfathomable. What has this to do with the Dao?\n\nYet within the formless, there is form; within the shapeless, there is shape. From emptiness and fullness, the white emerges; from non-being, being arises. If it is empty, whence comes the white? If it is nothing, whence comes being? This is the mystery within mystery, the wonder within wonder. Without attainment through practice or verification through effect, one cannot speak of it.\n\nOnly within the elusive and indistinct, the profound and unfathomable, may one perceive the image of true essence; only within the neither-having-nor-not-having may one see the principle of mutual entry. Then the Dao is within me. If one has not yet seen this, then mere side doors and minor methods—vain imaginings—how can they lead to accomplishment?\n\nWhen the Four Symbols meet, the mysterious body is achieved;\nwhen the Five Directions move, the purple light shines bright.\nShedding the embryo and entering the mouth, the body attains sagehood,\nand countless dragons and spirits are all struck with awe.\n\nThe Four Symbols are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior. The Five Directions are east, west, south, north, and center—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The Great Dao is empty and without form, yet the Golden Elixir is its profound mystery. Though the Golden Elixir is wondrous, it is nothing more than the gathering of the Five Phases and the harmonizing of the Four Symbols. When the Four Symbols unite, the mysterious body is again achieved; when the Five Directions converge, the elixir’s light shines resplendent.\n\nThis is not a matter of imagining the heart’s fire or the kidneys’ water, nor of taking the liver as the dragon or the lungs as the tiger. Heaven generates all beings, and humans are born with numinous treasures—the Five Phases gather here, the Four Symbols assemble here. If one practices the mysterious mechanism, then the Great Medicine is refined, the embryo shed and taken into the mouth, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood. Countless dragons and spirits all rise in reverence and awe—how could they not be utterly astonished? This is the Dao so lofty that dragons and tigers submit, virtue so weighty that ghosts and spirits revere it.\n\nWhen the swallows of the Flowery Pond depart, the moon’s radiance is clear;\nriding a golden dragon, one visits the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the host of immortals,\nthe tides of the sea and the shifting of valleys may change as they will.\n\nThe arts of the Golden Elixir, though numbered in the hundreds, hinge upon the divine water and the Flowery Pond. The Flowery Pond is the crucible for refining the elixir, within which divine water flows ceaselessly, day and night. If one obtains this and swallows it, then the moon’s brilliance congeals. This is what the Confucians mean by \"uniting brightness with the sun and moon,\" and what the Buddhists describe as \"perfectly round, luminous, and radiant.\"\n\nMetal is the White Tiger of the west; wood is the Azure Dragon of the east. Now, if one can cultivate the true and ride this golden dragon, then metal and wood will not be separated by decree. One may ascend to the Lord on High, release the primordial spirit—is this not visiting the Purple Tenuity? If one attains this Dao, then one ascends as an immortal, transcending life. Though the seas turn to mulberry fields, what has this to do with me? Thus, one may freely abide amid the shifting of valleys.\n\nKnow that the method of refining and nurturing the Returned Elixir\nshould be to plant the seed in one’s own garden.\nNo need for forced effort or laborious puffing—\nnaturally, the fruit ripens and the true embryo is shed.\n\nHumans receive the numinous qi of yin and yang, and thus possess the measure of a full catty of the Great Elixir. If it is not dissipated, one may endure with heaven and earth. Yet the six desires and seven emotions sever one’s celestial authenticity, so that one cannot be certain of the morrow. The supreme sages, in their compassion, bequeathed the method of the Returned Elixir, teaching one to refine and nurture it to exhaust the wonders of the nine returns and seven reversions. This is not something borrowed from the substance of plants or the artifice of humans—it is all a matter of seeking within oneself.\n\nThus, take the four great elements and the body as one’s garden, yin and yang qi as the seeds. Morning planting, evening harvest; spring growth, autumn withering; flowering, fruiting, the ripening of the fruit, the rounding of the embryo—all occurs in accordance with the natural seasons, in harmony with heaven and earth. There is no need to rely on forced effort or laborious puffing, nor to exhaust oneself with external affairs.\n\nCease all clever artifice and contrived effort;\nrecognize the deathless method of another’s house.\nIn the pot, the life-sustaining wine is ever replenished;\nin the tripod, the soul-returning nectar is gathered.",

      "translated_text": "Cultivating virtue brings ease to the heart and daily renewal; contrivance wearies the mind and leads to daily decline. Those who practice the Dao take the true and constant as their heart, uprightness as their thought—thus they turn from perversity to rectitude, emerge from death and enter life. If one resorts to artifice, the heart becomes crooked and thoughts inverted, deluded imaginings arise, and one dwells ever nearer to death.\n\nThough the division between life and death lies in the distinction between truth and falsehood, how then is this attained? Only by ever replenishing the life-sustaining wine within the pot, gathering the soul-returning nectar within the tripod, never allowing the true primordial essence to be depleted or the fundamental power to be exhausted. Like a lamp with oil, like a tree with roots, naturally its radiance shines forth, its branches and leaves flourish abundantly—this is indeed the method of deathlessness, how could it deceive?\n\nOn Snow Mountain, a single taste of fine *tiguhu*;\npoured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of transformation.\nShould one journey to Kunlun’s northwest,\nZhang Qian would first meet Magu.\n\nThis employs imagery as allegory, speaking of the Snow Mountain within the human body that yields the precious flavor of *tiguhu*. The mountain pertains to earth, which generates metal; metal’s qi is cold, hence it is called Snow Mountain. Yet metal is born of earth, its fluid flows forth, sweet in taste and white in hue, resembling *tiguhu*. Only when poured into the Eastern Sun’s furnace—where Eastern Sun pertains to the wood of *jia* and *yi*, and wood contains fire, which can overcome metal—does it become a work of creation. This transformative mystery is profound, beyond the ken of ordinary beings.\n\nIf, atop Kunlun’s peak, one encounters the northwest’s metal and water positions, allowing them to generate and restrain one another, seizing the creative power of heaven and earth, then yin and yang find their kindred, naturally uniting in resonance. Like Zhang Qian riding the countercurrent upstream, one may behold the immortal Magu. Zhang Qian represents the yang male; Magu, the yin female—this too is an allegory of union.\n\nNot knowing the yang essence and its host or guest,\nhow can one discern near from far?\nIn the chamber, vainly sealing the *weilü* cavity—\nhow many in Jambudvīpa have been thus misled!\n\nThe yang essence governs the hun and shen of the entire body—how could one recognize it? Moreover, there are host and guest, near and far, which require a master’s oral instructions to fathom. Otherwise, merely controlling the chamber and restraining essence by focusing on the *weilü* is mistaken.\n\nMaster Yunfang lamented:\n*\"Alas for the Three Peaks’ Yellow Valley Master—\nhow many in the Southern Continent have been misled!\"*\nThe Three Peaks refer to the art of yin elixirs, a method for preserving form and abiding in the world, not the Dao of immortals. Yet when people’s qi and blood are unsettled, facing circumstances they cannot forget their passions; though their hearts yearn for the Dao, desire is hard to suppress. Ancient immortals, in their compassion, among the three thousand six hundred gates, also taught methods of essence retention, so that people might understand the ceaseless transformations of life, taking essence, qi, and spirit as their foundation. To grasp them is to preserve; to abandon them is to perish. Applied to others, they can give life; retained within oneself, they can sustain one’s own life. This is no frivolous play, nor is it to be indulged wantonly.\n\nThough the sea is vast, it cannot fill a leaking vessel.\nIf the *weilü* is not sealed, how can one attain longevity?\nYet without a master’s transmission, many in Jambudvīpa have been misled.\n\nAll things flourish and each returns to its root;\nreturning to the root and reviving the mandate is constant abiding.\nKnowing the constant is the wondrous Dao—few comprehend it;\nreckless action often brings misfortune, as is often heard.\n\nThe *Daodejing* states: *\"All things flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reviving the mandate. Reviving the mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\"* Master Pingshu’s poem embodies this meaning.\n\nAll things arise from their nature and return to their nature—like blossoms and leaves that grow from the root and return to the root, like waves that arise from water and return to water. Once they return, stillness is attained and the mandate revived. Abiding in constancy without delusion, external falsehoods are wholly dispelled; profound stability radiates light, neither shifting with things nor vanishing with transformations. From its origin and its root, it endures unchanging.\n\nThus the *Zhun* hexagram of the *Yijing* says: *\"The sun and moon attain heaven and can shine long; the four seasons transform and can endure long. The sage abides long in the Dao, and the world is transformed and perfected.\"* The timeliness of *zhun* is truly great! How could ordinary people comprehend this?\n\nYet because it is difficult for people to grasp, they often act recklessly and invite misfortune, bringing turmoil upon themselves. Thus to \"violate the constant,\" \"alter the constant,\" or \"deviate from the constant\" brings misfortune, never fortune.\n\nOuye received the sword-forging method in person,\nmatching Ye Stream’s metal and water to temper hardness and softness.\nOnce refined, it understands its wielder’s intent—\na thousand miles away, it slays evil in a flash of lightning.\n\nOuyezhi, a rustic scholar of ancient times, forged swords worth a thousand gold—not by any other means, but by the mutual generation of metal and water, the harmonizing of hardness and softness, refined a hundred times to become unmatched in the world. As an analogy for the great Dao of the golden elixir, this is the method of forging swords. Speaking of the human body, in the land of Ye and Han there are the substances of metal and water, the functions of hardness and softness. If one obtains a master’s refining, its edge is irresistible. Naturally, it becomes luminously responsive, discerning things as they arise, perceiving affairs as they occur. Though evil and obstinacy may be a thousand miles away, they can be subdued beneath a flash of lightning. This clarity that sees a thousand miles, its cold radiance and true color, are all natural secondary effects.\n\nKnocking bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade fungus,\nstrumming the zither to call the phoenix to drink the *daogui* pellet.\nLately, golden light has suffused my body—\nI speak not of this mechanism to ordinary people.\n\nThis employs imagery as allegory, alluding to the substances within the human body. The bamboo and zither, when struck, produce sound; the turtle and phoenix share similar forms. The jade fungus and *daogui* pellet are alike—both born of harmonious qi, products of metal and earth.",

      "translated_text": "Though the names differ in six ways, their fundamental nature is but three. Speaking of the great Dao as non-action, it initially requires no deliberate effort; yet when tally and tally correspond, when qi and resonance align, within non-action there is action—responding to the mechanisms of heaven and earth, all through the Dao of natural resonance and union.\n\nThus, within the human body, a single substance: when struck like bamboo, the turtle may be summoned; when strummed like a zither, the phoenix may be called. All is resonance of sound and qi, response of breath and breath—swift as echo and shadow. When harmonious qi naturally brings forth auspiciousness, the jade fungus may be swallowed, the *daogui* pellet may be drunk. Its joints and vessels, its veins and textures, all flow unimpeded from top to bottom. Qi of the same kind summons one another, requiring no extra effort to manifest its efficacy.\n\nRightly so, golden light suffuses the body, present within and manifest without—like jade in the mountain that moistens the trees, like a pearl in the deep that keeps the cliffs from withering. Most profound, most wondrous—how could one speak of such mysteries to the vulgar?\n\nOnly when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form;\nthe Dao, in its rarity and stillness, accords with nature.\nA single grain of numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—\nthen one knows my fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nLike sounds resonate, like qi seeks its kind. The great medicine of the golden elixir arises from nothing but lead and mercury. Lead can transform mercury, and mercury in turn transforms lead. Seven returns, nine refinements—this is the external elixir.\n\nThat which cannot be seen is called *xi* (rare);\nthat which cannot be heard is called *yi* (still).\nThe great Dao of *xi* and *yi* emerges from nature—\nit is the Dao of clarity and quiescence, non-action: this is the internal elixir.\n\nWith the internal elixir to refine the spirit,\nthere must also be the external elixir to refine the form,\nso that both form and spirit attain wondrous union, merging with the true Dao.\nA single grain of elixir, numinous and wondrous in its workings,\nnaturally transcends the mortal to enter sagehood,\npasses from death into life—\nis this not \"my fate lies with me, not with heaven\"?\n\nThe radiant cinnabar elixir may be completed in a day—\nthe ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.\nIf one speaks of nine years or three years,\nit is all but procrastination and delay.\n\nThe great Dao of the golden elixir is the supreme vehicle to immortality—\nought it not be most difficult?\nYet Lü Dongbin (Pure Serenity) declared it could be achieved in a day—\nhow could this be so?\nHe also said: \"All comes down to a moment’s effort,\nyet it secures boundless ease and joy forever.\"\nThus we know Yin Zhenren’s words: \"The most divine and sagely is most effortless.\"\nBelieve these words, and the supreme Dao is not burdensome—\nit is no mere side path of many affairs.\nIn a moment, in a day, the Dao is perceived as present.\nTo speak of nine years or three is but to delay one’s own progress.\nThat which is grasped is preserved; that which is released is lost—\nwithout fixed time, without known direction—\nsuch is far from the Dao.\n\nYanzi’s feigned foolishness,\nZengzi’s single-minded \"yes,\"\nXiangyan’s striking of bamboo,\nShancai’s snapping of fingers—\neven Confucians and Buddhists strive for it.\nHow much more, then, to ascend to immortality from the common,\nto transcend the mortal and enter sagehood—\ncould this not be achieved in a day?\n\nThe great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—\nknow that it depends on fate, yet also on heaven.\nIf one has not accumulated deeds and bestowed hidden virtue,\nat every turn demonic obstacles arise to block the way.\n\nMan stands with heaven and earth as the Three Powers—\nwhy then do men often die young, while heaven and earth endure without end?\nThose who understand know:\none must cultivate the great Dao of the golden elixir,\nto match heaven and earth in their completion.\nIs this a trifling matter?\nThus, to cultivate the Dao of immortality,\none must first cultivate the Dao of man.\nIf one is ashamed in the Dao of man,\nthe Dao of immortality remains distant.\n\nWhat is the Dao of man?\nOnly to accumulate deeds to save others,\nto harbor hidden virtue in the world—\nlike heaven and earth’s all-covering and all-bearing, without a trace of selfishness;\nlike the Supreme Emperor’s love of life, without a thought of killing.\nThus, looking up, one feels no shame; looking down, one commits no wrong—\nthen heaven naturally protects, and all is auspicious.\nIf one cultivates the great medicine to seek immortality,\nthe Dao is most easy—all depends on oneself.\nBut if one feels shame in the hidden chamber,\ndeceives in the dark,\nthen demonic obstacles arise daily,\nand the path becomes most difficult.\nIndeed, it is not inherently difficult—\nit is that heaven cannot tolerate it.\nNot that heaven is at fault,\nbut that one lacks virtue to align with heaven’s heart.\nCan those who study the Dao not seek the easy and discard the difficult?\n\nThe Three Powers mutually consume in their time;\nthe *Dao* and *De*, the *Yinfu*, reveal the sacred mechanism.\nWhen the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,\nthe hundred bones are all ordered—proof of non-action.\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* says:\n\"Heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things;\nthe myriad things are the thieves of man;\nman is the thief of the myriad things.\"\nIt also says: \"Consume in their time, and the myriad transformations are at peace.\"\nThis has been explained in detail in the *Lecture on the Yinfu Jing*.\nYet Pure Serenity further expounds on the proof of non-action:\nthough the ceaseless transformations of generation and decay, waxing and waning,\nmay seem like many affairs,\nthe great Dao is impartial—\nnothing is not the principle of nature.\nIf one can fill oneself with this and put it to use,\nthe mind mirrors the great void, and all concerns naturally cease;\nqi embraces the primordial beginning, and the hundred bones harmonize.\nThe Dao of non-action may be realized in the immortal realm of the Great Clarity.\n\nThe precious words of the *Yinfu* exceed three hundred;\nthe numinous script of the *Daode* fills five thousand.\nImmortals past and present are without number—\nall have grasped the true meaning here.\n\nHow profound! The great Dao is hard to transmit,\nand does not rely on written words.\nYet jade tablets and golden oracles, divine chapters and precious scrolls,\nstand arrayed like a martial arsenal,\ncomplete as a comprehensive tortoise-shell divination.\nFrom what should the student of the Dao draw verification?\nOnly within the most complex lies the principle of utmost simplicity;\nwithin the most detailed, the use of utmost essentiality.\nIs it not that the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing*, with its words exceeding three hundred,\nand the Supreme Venerable One’s *Daode Jing*, with its text filling five thousand,\ncontain the profound subtleties of the great Dao, leaving nothing untouched?\nImmortals past and present who ascend to the golden towers,\nwho wander and feast in the jade capital,\nare beyond counting—\nyet all have grasped the true meaning of these two classics,\nattained their wondrous use.\nStudents must not ignore their essentials\nwhile seeking side paths among the three thousand six hundred.\n\nIt is like the hundred schools of thought, the miscellaneous records and commentaries—\nfilling houses, straining oxen—\ntheir number is beyond reckoning.\nYet the Dao of the Six Classics all returns to the simple principle of qian and kun.\nSo too the great Dao of the golden elixir does not exceed the two classics:\nthe *Yinfu* and the *Daode*.",

those of immortal wind and Daoist bone\ncan know the method of cultivation.\nYet the medicine, the fire-timing,\nthe operations of withdrawal and addition—\nmust accord with heaven and earth.\nDo not know advance but not retreat,\nknow action but not cessation.\nThus, before refining the returning elixir,\nhasten to cultivate—\nas Master Lü said, “To begin swiftly is already too late.”\nOnce refined, guard it well,\ndo not recklessly add fire-timing.\nIf the fire-timing is amiss,\nthe sun’s flowing pearl—\nfierce and violent in nature—\nwill ever seek to leave you.\nOne day, it may spill and be lost,\nbringing ruin and disgrace.\nAs Zhongli said, “When the medicine is ripe,\ndo not apply fire-timing—\nto do so would harm the elixir.”\nFrom this, we see:\nThose who do not know cultivation\nare like those who do not weed their sprouts.\nThose who know cultivation but do not know when to stop\nare like those who pull the sprouts to help them grow.\nHow can one not be cautious?\n\nKnow that the gate of death is the gate of life—\ndo not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.\nIf you grasp the mechanism of killing and reversal,\nyou will see that harm contains the seed of grace.\n\nLife is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nGrace arises from harm,\nharm arises from grace.\nThis is the teaching of the *Yinfu Jing*.\nMaster Lü’s verse merely elucidates its depths.\nFor metal is born in *si*, dies in *zi*.\n*Zi* is the realm of water,\nyet metal can generate water.\nWood is born in *hai*, dies in *wu*.\n*Wu* is the realm of fire,\nyet wood can generate fire.\nWater and earth are born in *shen*, die in *mao*.\n*Mao* is the position of wood,\nyet water can generate wood.\nThus, life is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nYet while the root of life and death is fixed,\nthe meaning of grace and harm differs.\nOnly the transformations of metal and fire\ncannot be judged by life and death.\nThe *Longhu Shangjing* says:\n“Metal and fire are the true medicine.”\nIn the art of the elixir, nothing is more manifest than metal and fire.\nFor fire is born in *yin*, dies in *you*.\n*You* is the realm of metal—\nthis fire can only overcome metal,\nhow can it generate metal?\nMoreover, *you* is the realm where metal flourishes,\nwhile fire is in its place of death.\nUnable to overcome it as harm,\nmetal instead receives its flourishing as grace.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n“When metal enters the fierce fire,\nits color does not lose its radiant light.”\nIs this not grace born from harm?\nThis is the principle of reversal in the mechanism of killing—\nwithout penetrating insight into the transformations of the five phases,\nit cannot be known.\nSome mistakenly take the gate of life and gate of death\nas the yin and hidden places of women,\nand “grace born from harm” as the art of sexual union that harms virtue.\nThis is wrong.\nThe great Dao is pure and tranquil, fundamentally undefiled—\nhow could filthy conduct lead to immortality?\n\nFortune and misfortune arise in mutual dependence,\nlike echo following sound, shadow following form.\nIf you can turn this mechanism of life and killing,\ndisaster transforms into blessing in the turn of a palm.\n\nFortune leans upon misfortune,\nmisfortune lurks within fortune—\nlike echo answering sound, shadow following form,\nit cannot be ignored.\nIf one learns the Dao and cultivates the true,\nvirtue and fortune grow lofty,\nlife endures, vision persists,\none becomes an immortal among mortals—\nthis is the wondrous Dao of emerging from death and entering life.\nBut if one turns from the Dao and harms life,\nindulging in sensual pleasures,\none becomes a walking corpse, a moving privy,\nhastening only to decay and ruin.\nThe mechanism shifts from life to killing,\nfortune turns to disaster—\nas easily as turning a palm.\nFrom this, we see:\n“Following the good brings fortune,\nfollowing the

      "translated_text": "**Five-Word Quatrain**—Its first line aligns with the number of the Great Unity.\nA maiden dons azure robes,\nHer lord dons silken white.\nSeen, it cannot be employed;\nEmployed, it cannot be seen.\nIn the dim and vague, they meet,\nIn the deep and dark, change arises.\nIn a flash, flames take flight—\nThe Perfected One appears of itself.\n\nMaster Pingshu’s poem employs the method of the Great Unity’s number. The profound subtleties of the Great Dao are fully revealed, yet without a teacher’s transmission, even the wise and discerning will struggle to fathom it. Now, the maiden is yin; the lord is yang. Azure robes are the wood of the east, Jia and Yi; silken white is the metal of the west, Geng and Xin. Male and female differ in form, yin and yang in qi, metal and wood in essence, east and west in position—how could these be the Dao? Only the sage harmonizes and unites them, causing male and female, yin and yang to interact within the central palace, metal and wood, east and west to merge upon the Yellow Way. When the maiden dons azure robes, yin can bear yang; when the lord dons silken white, yang can embrace yin. Naturally, harmony accumulates within, brilliance radiates without; the empty chamber generates brightness, fullness shines with splendor. Thus, *seen, it cannot be employed; employed, it cannot be seen*—this is precisely the Confucian and Daoist principle of standing tall and resolute. To stand is to see it before one—this is the meaning of *seen*. Yet when one gazes ahead, it suddenly appears behind; though one wishes to follow, there is no way—this is *cannot be employed*. The Buddhist’s *perfectly round, radiant, luminous, and free* is the meaning of *employed*, while its *cool wisdom, wondrously complete, body naturally empty and still* is *cannot be seen*. The Most High said: *Dim and vague, within it there is something*; thus, meeting in the dim and vague is not without perception. *Deep and dark, within it there is essence*; thus, change within the deep and dark is not without use. Preserving the insubstantial while guarding the substantial, in an instant it is accomplished—most divine, most effortless. Is this not *in a flash, flames take flight, the Perfected One appears of itself*? Thus, a body is born beyond the body, nature is seen upon nature; coming and going are free, the original face is recognized. Therefore, from this ordinary fire arises true fire, from this ordinary person emerges the Perfected One. Yet is the dim and vague truly so? From nothing arises something, from something arises nothing—mystery within mystery, wonder within wonder. One may speak of it with immortals, but it is hard to speak of it with the mortal-boned.\n\n**Twelve *Xijiangyue* Poems**—Corresponding to the twelve months.\nThe inner elixir resembles the outer,\nThe inner must connect with the outer.\nThe cinnabar head’s benefits and harms are roughly the same;\nNurturing employs two methods.\n\nWithin, there is the celestial true fire,\nThe crucible glows with enduring crimson.\nThe outer furnace’s increase and decrease require diligent effort—\nNo wonder surpasses the true seed.\n\nThe essential Dao of immortal cultivation lies in refining the golden liquid and returning elixir. Yet the elixir is divided into inner and outer, and nurturing employs two methods. Both must be harmonized to transcend the mortal and enter the sagely. If there is inner elixir but no outer elixir, the physical form—composed of father’s essence and mother’s blood, the four great elements provisionally combined—remains a mortal shell, heavy and stagnant, without transmutation. How could one attain the Dao? If there is outer elixir but no inner elixir, though the great medicine is wondrous, it remains external, a mere thing. Seeking within, the celestial true has been depleted, spirit exhausted, qi scattered, essence and spirit dull. Applying the outer elixir is like boiling an empty cauldron—it only hastens ruin, never achieving transformation. Master Pingshu’s verses first clarify the inner and outer elixirs. Does he not understand the Dao? Moreover, the outer elixir uses only lead and mercury, with no杂 or impurities. The five metals, eight stones, herbs, and decayed matter are all excluded. Through fire phases of withdrawal and addition, emulating heaven and earth’s patterns, prolonged refinement circulates qi through the celestial cycles, and one may become a treasured immortal. As the scripture says: *Once the great medicine is complete, magpies feeding become phoenixes, crows eating become simurghs, dogs licking become dragons, and humans consuming ascend as immortals.* As for the inner elixir within the body—neither heart nor kidney, neither lung nor spleen, neither qi nor essence, neither blood nor fluid—it is also nothing but lead and mercury, yin and yang paired. Refined with true fire and primal yang, it mirrors the outer elixir, causing the crucible to glow crimson. Following the proper times for increase and decrease, one refines it into a purely yang substance, casting no shadow at noon. Only then may one ingest the outer elixir, making both form and spirit wondrous, merging with the true Dao, shedding the mortal shell, and ascending in broad daylight. Thus, *the inner elixir resembles the outer; the inner must connect with the outer*—one cannot be partial and incomplete. Yet why are the true seed the same, while nurturing employs two methods? What is shared is lead and mercury; the difference lies in the fire phases. For the outer elixir, one uses ordinary charcoal and human-made fire; for the inner elixir, one employs the celestial true fire.\n\n**Xijiangyue**\nThis Dao is most divine, most sagely—\nI fear your meager fate cannot endure it.",

The Tortoise and Serpent symbolize water and fire. The Toad and Crow are the essences of moon and sun. Qian and Kun represent the pairing of heaven and earth. This one yin and one yang are called the Dao; the conjoining of sun and moon is called the Elixir. With yang alone and no yin, yang has nothing to transform. With yin alone and no yang, yin has nothing to generate. The two qi mutually sustain each other, revolving and transmuting—now separating, now uniting—endlessly wondrous in their workings. Thus, like the Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love bound in green, this is the root of the Dao. Water-Tortoise and Fire-Serpent, *Kan* and *Li*, unite in natural affinity. Moon-Toad and Sun-Crow meet at the dark moon’s phase, their radiance enduring. Heaven-*Qian* and Earth-*Kun* embrace and uphold all with vastness, their marvelous workings divine. Man, standing as one of the Three Powers alongside heaven and earth, likewise relies on the pairing of yin and yang to complete the Dao—termed the Mysterious Female, Lead and Mercury, Dragon and Tiger, Crow and Hare, Metal and Wood, Water and Fire, Black and White, East and West, *Kan* and *Li*, Husband and Wife. The names are innumerable, yet all embody the principle of yin and yang’s mutual resonance. Should yin remain solely yin and yang solely yang, sundered and uncommunicating, fault arises and life is cut short. How then can one emerge from death and enter life, enduring as long as heaven and earth?\n\n---\n\n**Moon Over the West River**\n\n*\"Within the male lies hidden feminine essence,\nBearing yin yet embracing yang’s essence.\nWhen the two harmonize, the medicine is complete—\nTransmuting soul and spirit, sacred and numinous.\n\nTrust in the single grain of Golden Elixir:\nThe serpent swallows it and at once becomes a dragon.\nThe fowl feeds on it and transforms into a phoenix—\nAll enter the true realm of pure yang.\"*\n\nThe one yin and one yang are called the Dao; the union of sun and moon is called the Elixir.

For the crow pertains to *geng* and *xin* Metal, the hare to *jia* and *yi* Wood. Let no barrier divide them, and the sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po* will harmonize in one place, becoming supremely numinous and sacred.

Bird, and Dark Warrior.\nCinnabar-mercury is mercury drawn from cinnabar.\nLead-silver is silver drawn from lead.\nFire-timing refers to the fire of true yang and the seasonal tokens of its

assign the liver to the Green Dragon, the lungs to the White Tiger,\nthe heart to the Vermilion Bird, and the kidneys to the Dark Warrior.\nSuch conflations of the Five Phases and Four Images\nrender the refinement of the Golden Elixir utterly indiscriminate,\nunable to distinguish cinnabar-mercury from lead-silver.\nNor are these Five Phases and Four Images to be sought outside the body—\nfor

function within tangible form\ndoes one progress from the coarse to the refined,\ntranscending the mundane to enter the sacred,\nthereby grasping the secret of lead and mercury.\nYet even if one recognizes cinnabar and black lead,\nignorance of fire-timing renders such knowledge idle.\nHow much worse to lack understanding entirely,\nyet mislead others with false instruction—\na case of the blind leading the blind,\nwith no hope of escape.\nCan such a heart endure its own indifference?\n\n---\n\nHeaven and Earth alternate between closure and openness;\ndawn and dusk must recognize the

the inception of difficulty,\nas the noble one weaves the warp and weft of creation—\nthings in their nascent struggle must not be harmed.\n*Youthful Folly* (蒙) depicts a spring emerging from the mountain’s base,\nas the noble one nurtures virtue through resolute action—\nthe spring’s first flow must be guided with innocence to cultivate integrity.\n\nThese four hexagrams’ meanings,\nwhen

furnace and crucible—\nhow forced and contrived!\n\nThey fail to grasp that the Dao consists of the interplay of yin and yang,\nwhile the work lies in the alternations of *Stagnation* (否), *Peace* (泰), *Inception* (屯), and *Folly* (蒙).\nIn the language of the Golden Elixir,\nall depends on the essence of yin-yang union.\nIf Heaven remains Heaven and Earth remains Earth,\n*Stagnation* persists,

evening as *Folly* (蒙),\nthis signifies vigilance in preservation—\never mindful of the difficulty of inception and the nurturing of innocence,\nnever allowing a single stray thought or moment of indulgence.\nVigilant where unseen, fearful where unheard,\none remains unwavering in the fleeting moments of dawn and dusk.\nThrough such cultivation,\nspokes converge at the hub like a chariot in motion, flawless and unbroken,\nlike water flowing in its course, turning myriad bends yet ever eastward.\nThus the mechanism of the primordial qi of True Unity\nresonates in perfect accord with the celestial rhythm,\nwithdrawal and addition harmonizing the workings of Heaven’s design.\n\nHaving attained this Treasure of Life,\none must uphold its fullness and preserve its achievement.\nAs

Whether it be the Four Beginnings and ten thousand virtues all perfected, or the Six Perfections and ten thousand practices jointly cultivated, hidden merits and manifest virtues truly accumulated through long effort, equalizing self and others, friend and foe with impartial benevolence—only then does one fulfill the original vow of immortals.\n\nAs the ancient saying goes: “To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first fulfill the Dao of humanity.” Extending this mind onward, calamities naturally dissipate, and tigers, rhinos, blades, and weapons cannot harm.
