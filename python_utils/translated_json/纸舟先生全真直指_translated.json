  "full_translation": "**The Venerable Paper Boat’s Direct Pointer to the Complete Reality**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Venerable Paper Boat’s Direct Pointer to the Complete Reality*\nCompiled by Jin Yueyan of the Yuan dynasty; transmitted by Huang Gongwang of the Great Delusion.\nOne fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Venerable Paper Boat’s Direct Pointer to the Complete Reality**\nCompiled by Jin Yueyan, lineage-holder of the Orthodox Complete Reality School\nTransmitted by Huang Gongwang, lineage-holder of the Great Delusion of the Complete Reality School\n\nThe study of Complete Reality directly investigates the profound mystery, being the singular illumination of the supreme Dao. It is not to be compared with the lesser vehicles, miscellaneous teachings, or sundry arts.\n\nSince the emergence of the Five Patriarchs and Seven Perfected Ones, all those in the world who attained the Dao did so through direct self-realization, mind-to-mind transmission, without relying on even a single written word. Herein lies its marvel.\n\nIn later generations, as disciples multiplied, those whose masters were authentic transmitted teachings that all aligned perfectly. Those whose masters were inauthentic either practiced rigid sitting and desiccated meditation, or swallowed essence and inhaled qi, or fixated the mind on the kidneys, or杂dabbled in heterodox paths—practices not only futile but harmful.\n\nMoreover, the essential handle of Complete Reality lies in the state before one’s parents were born, where the true is already complete. It neither increases with life nor diminishes with death. If one uses the mind to seal emptiness and awakens to the original true, then the true is naturally complete, the foundation of the Golden Elixir is established, and the basis of the Great Medicine is laid.\n\nSome claim that the Golden Elixir is the path of immortals and must involve esoteric oral transmissions from a master. Others assert that the Great Dao is merely the singular cultivation of the nature school, and that neglecting the life school precludes attaining the immortal path. Here, we dispel this doubt for the multitude.\n\nConsider how fish transform into dragons, rotten wheat into butterflies, sparrows enter water and become clams, clams metamorphose into flying quails, and chaste maidens turn to stone. These beings transmute from the sentient to the insentient, or from the insentient to the sentient. Some transform through the firmness of a single thought, others through contact with yin and yang qi.\n\nFrom the perspective of their natures, there are differences between flying and burrowing, moving and still, plant and animal. From the perspective of their forms, there are distinctions in scales, shells, feathers, and fur. Their transformations are as wondrous and unfathomable as this. How could there be any esoteric oral transmission from a true master?\n\nThe disparity between creatures and humans is as vast as that between heaven and earth. Humans, being the most spiritually endowed of all beings, if they can awaken to the marvel of Complete Reality, maintain unbroken mindfulness, concentrate qi to attain suppleness, illuminate the singular spirit without obscurity, return the six senses to a state of nakedness, guard the One while forgetting the One, and abide in utter emptiness until stillness reaches its extreme—then stillness will stabilize the nature, the nature will stabilize the life, the life will stabilize the Elixir, and the Elixir’s completion will allow the spirit to transform boundlessly.\n\nHuman transmutation into immortals is no different from the firmness of thought or contact with qi that transforms creatures. Yet how lamentable that today’s students, with shallow capacities and weak faith in the Dao, harbor ever-growing doubts while their right causes daily diminish. They do not apply themselves with arduous effort yet hope to attain the Dao instantaneously.\n\nThey fail to realize that those who attain the Dao instantaneously have all cultivated virtuous fruits over thousands of lifetimes, and only at this juncture, with merit fulfilled and work accomplished, do they attain the Dao instantaneously. Now, with their ordinary fleshly forms, their conduct unrectified and their merit unaccumulated, if they seek the immediate completion of the Elixir Path, it is farther from them than the farthest distance.\n\nHereafter, we present the seven stages of the Seven Perfected Ones’ simultaneous mastery of form and spirit, the sevenfold return to the unified seal, and the step-by-step instructions for entering the chamber. Though this may stir waves in a windless sky or cast clouds over empty space, if you do not trust these words of this poor Daoist, you may as well await direct transmission from Zhong and Lü.\n\nYet even if you grasp half, how will you comprehend the other half? A stone maiden takes flight; a wooden man cries out.\n\n---\n**The Ancestor of the Golden Elixir, the Origin of Creation**\nThe formless gives rise to heaven and earth;\nComplete Reality spans ancient and modern.\nEnter here from this very place—\nBeware of seeking it elsewhere.\n\nThe Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One qi;\nThe One qi, through yin and yang, completes the ten thousand images.\nIf the master of the house can comprehend this,\nWhy seek lead in water?\n\nOriginally a mass of blood and flesh,\nAwareness wholly depends on the yang spirit.\nWho animates movement, rest, speech, and silence?\nWhen the spirit departs, there is nothing left to grasp.\n\nThough myriad names and forms are expounded,\nThey only lead people deeper into delusion.\nFrom this day forth, awakened to Complete Reality,\nMarvelous words and wondrous sayings are no longer believed.\n\nRadiance pervades the empty space above and below;\nEvery person is fully endowed without lack.\nWithin Complete Reality, the true mechanism is revealed—\nTrue realization is non-dual and non-action.\n\nSweep away frivolous names and wild characters;\nLet not even a speck linger in the breast.\nThe Seven Perfected and Five Patriarchs were no different—\nAwakening to the true transcends the realm of sages.\n\n---\n**Yang Spirit ● Solar Soul**\nForm and spirit both verified,\nTruly awakened to the ultimate real.\nThe soul is the yang spirit;\nThe corporeal soul is the yin form.\n\nForm borrows the spirit’s numinosity—\nAs the moon’s brightness depends on the sun.\n\n**Yin Form ○ Lunar Corporeal Soul**\nThe child ever clings to the mother;\nThe wife follows her husband’s path.\nWhen form and spirit conjoin in stillness,\nYin and yang establish their root.\n\nThoughts unbroken, continuously,\nOver time, they naturally become numinous.\nUnceasing in cultivation and realization,\nOne transcends to the Jade Capital.\n\n---\n**The Sevenfold Return: The Seven Perfected’s Unified Seal**\n\n**Form and Spirit Attend Each Other**\nA lifetime spent in drunken dreams, wandering a long road—\nSuddenly, one arises to recognize the other.\n\n**Initial Entry into the Dao**\nFace-to-face, no place to hide—\nOnly now, in the moment, does one distinguish near from far.\n\n**Form and Spirit Accompany Each Other**\nOne day, knowing each other as the utmost real,\nFrom now on, guest and host exchange intimacy.\n*Called \"Attaining the True\"*\n\nAmidst the boundless cosmos, countless people—\nWho would believe ice exists within winter’s fire?\n\n**Form and Spirit Merge**\nHow could a child bear to leave its parents?\nTogether they walk, sit, and even share garments.\n*Called \"Preserving the True\"*\n\nWere it not for turning to face this son,\nIt would make Hanshan and Shide’s wives laugh.\n\n**Form and Spirit Embrace**\nPure yang wholly embraces yin,\nNo need for contrived seeking or pursuit.\n*Called \"Summoning as if Carving\"*\n\nThe slightest movement, and the Elixir scatters—\nThis is gold within the water of eternal life.\n\n**Form and Spirit Both Perfected**\nA brocade robe and jade bridle, a dappled steed—\nHow many times has one journeyed to and from Peach Blossom Spring?\n*Called \"Inverted Carving\"*\n\nTreading emerald and piercing crimson—what was all that for?\nNow, at rest, one has already forgotten the way home.\n\n**Form and Spirit Both Released**\nThe golden lock is torn open—emptiness at both ends,\nNot to be confused with the vastness of the Great Ultimate.\n*Called \"Realizing the True\"*\n\nInverting grasp of Guanghan, returning to the primordial abyss,\nStar-strewn lapels stir the winds of heaven.\n\n**Universally Ferrying Later Learners**\nOar strikes oar in ceaseless return—\nIf you are destined, board this boat.\n\n**Awakening the True through the True**\nThe true transcends the other shore to become true awakening;\nFor self-cultivation, one must also cultivate others.\n\n**Entering the Chamber: Essential Steps**\n*Constructing the Chamber*\nThe dimensions of the chamber follow fixed principles.\n\n**Upon Entering the Chamber**\nGenerally, one must concentrate spirit and gather qi.\nWhen true qi is full, spirit becomes naturally efficacious—\nEfficacious, then transformation occurs.\n\nYet concentrating spirit and gathering qi\nDepend entirely on purity and stillness—\nOne cannot be careless in small matters and hinder great affairs.\n\n**Dietary Precautions**\nImpure meat breeds impure qi,\nRank vegetables foster anger,\nThe five flavors deplete primordial essence—\nAll must be abstained from.\nDo not assume they are harmless or unobstructive to the Great Dao,\nFor otherwise, qi will not be clear and spirit will not be at peace;\nSpirit unsettled, nothing can be achieved.\n\n**On Drowsiness**\nAt first, sitting often induces drowsiness—\nModerate diet allows qi to flow freely,\nAn empty mind keeps spirit clear and still.\n\nWhen drowsiness overtakes you, do not walk,\nFor walking wearies the spirit,\nWearied spirit scatters qi,\nScattered qi dulls the spirit—\nHarmful to oneself, of no benefit to the Dao.\nWhen drowsy, simply rise and walk slowly for a few steps,\nThen sit again, rouse the spirit,\nRegulate the breath, and return to the root.\nBreath returned, qi is born;\nQi born, spirit abides;\nSpirit abiding, over time,\nThe demon of sleep naturally retreats.\n\n**On Prolonged Sitting**\nAfter sitting long, one may feel true qi ascending and descending within,\nOr warmth in the kidneys,\nOr the body’s subtle movements—\nThese are merely signs of true qi gradually gathering,\nOccasional phenomena, not to be marveled at;\nLet them unfold naturally.\n\nAfter sitting long, at night, sudden openings and closings may occur,\nEyes perceiving light like the sun, moon, or lamp,\nOr a vast expanse of brightness, fading gradually or vanishing abruptly—\nThis is the false radiance of deluded thought,\nNot a true realm—\nDo not cling to it.\n\nAfter sitting long, one may see mountains, forests, cities,\nOr beloved and detested figures from daily life—\nThese visions arise from unexhausted perceptions,\nDeluded thoughts manifesting—\nSweep them away, pay them no mind.\n\nAfter sitting long, form and spirit may suddenly be forgotten,\nAnd true realms appear within the body—\nDo not delight in them,\nFor attachment breeds demonic obsession.\n\nAfter sitting long in the chamber, the heart may suddenly flare,\nProducing chaotic visions—\nDo not speak of them recklessly to others,\nFor this is the work of the spirit’s discernment.\nIf the heart’s restlessness cannot be curbed,\nRelax slightly, have someone rouse you—\nAwakened, the visions will disperse.\n\nIf minor discomfort arises during sitting,\nAdjust body and mind, regulate and dispel it.\nIf the disturbance is unbearable,\nPause to recover,\nThen sit again at leisure.\n\nA snail’s breath cannot withstand the cold and heat of heaven and earth—\nTake care not to harm life.\n\nAfter sitting long with mastery,\nA \"person without position\" may suddenly appear and disappear—\nLet it be, do not cling to it.\nTo do so is still illness—\nThough it seems thus, do not mistake the empty flowers of a diseased eye.\nA single bout of confusion may run rampant,\nYet from the first, you have yearned for the mysterious wind,\nDevotedly revering the Supreme Dao.\n\nLonging to forge a three-foot sword,\nWould you abandon six pecks of dust?\nYour aspiration granted by heaven, your learning should be as vast as the heart—\nHaving encountered Master Paper Boat,\nImprinted with the wonders of the Complete Truth,\nHow could I hoard the books of the Great Dao for myself alone?\nThus, I widely disseminate them to the multitude,\nUntangling bonds, severing delusion, dispelling doubt.\nIf both mind and method are illuminated,\nA single glance reveals all as if on the palm of the hand.\nDo not seek to confine it to the round symbol—\nIt is like a pearl in water,\nTurning light back to its source,\nThe Complete Truth at this very moment.\nBorrowing events to illustrate principle,\nWhat is the meaning of the \"turning body\" phrase at the end?\n\n**The True Beyond a Single Point, the Seven Perfected Not False**\nThe mud dragon of the Eastern Sea roars at the purple turtle.\nOnce the pivot of primordial harmony is penetrated,\nFrost and moon fill the sky, the night crow cries.\n\n*Master Paper Boat’s Direct Pointers to the Complete Truth*",

perceptions,\nDeluded thoughts manifesting—\nSweep them away, pay them no mind.\n\nAfter sitting long, form and spirit may suddenly be forgotten,\nAnd true realms appear within the body—\nDo not delight in them,\nFor attachment breeds demonic obsession.\n\nAfter sitting long in the chamber, the heart may suddenly flare,\nProducing chaotic visions—\nDo not speak of them recklessly to others,\nFor this is the work of the spirit’s discernment.\nIf the heart’s restlessness cannot be curbed,\nRelax slightly, have someone rouse you—\nAwakened, the visions will disperse.\n\nIf minor discomfort arises during sitting,\nAdjust body and mind, regulate and dispel it.\nIf the disturbance is unbearable,\nPause to recover,\nThen sit again at leisure.\n\nA snail’s breath cannot withstand the cold and heat of heaven and earth—\nTake care not to harm life.\n\nAfter sitting long with mastery,\nA \"person without position\" may suddenly appear and disappear—\nLet it be, do not cling to it.\nTo do so is still illness—\nThough it seems thus, do not mistake the empty flowers of a diseased eye.\nA single bout of confusion may run rampant,\nYet from the first, you have yearned for the mysterious wind,\nDevotedly revering the Supreme Dao.\n\nLonging to forge a three-foot sword,\nWould you abandon six pecks of dust?\nYour aspiration granted by heaven, your learning should be as vast as the heart—\nHaving encountered Master Paper Boat,\nImprinted with the wonders of the Complete Truth,\nHow could I hoard the books of the Great Dao for myself alone?\nThus, I widely disseminate them to the multitude,\nUntangling bonds, severing delusion, dispelling doubt.\nIf both mind and method are illuminated,\nA single glance reveals all as if on the palm of the hand.\nDo not seek to confine it to the round symbol—\nIt is like a pearl in water,\nTurning light back to its source,\nThe Complete Truth at this very moment.\nBorrowing events to illustrate principle,\nWhat is the meaning of the \"turning body\" phrase at the end?\n\n**The True Beyond a Single Point, the Seven Perfected Not False**\nThe mud dragon of the Eastern Sea roars at the purple turtle.\nOnce the pivot of primordial harmony is penetrated,\nFrost and moon fill the sky, the night crow cries.\n\n*Master Paper Boat’s Direct Pointers to the Complete Truth*",
      "overlap_context": "Pure yang wholly embraces yin,\nNo need for contrived seeking or pursuit.\n*Called \"Summoning as if Carving\"*\n\nThe slightest movement, and the Elixir scatters—\nThis is gold within the water of eternal life.\n\n**Form and Spirit Both Perfected**\nA brocade robe and jade bridle, a dappled steed—\nHow many times has one journeyed to and from Peach Blossom Spring?\n*Called \"Inverted Carving\"*\n\nTreading emerald and piercing crimson—what was all that for?\nNow, at rest, one has already forgotten the way home.",
