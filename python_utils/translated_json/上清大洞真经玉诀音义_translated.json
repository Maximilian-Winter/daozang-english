  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*\n**Author:** Daoist Chen Jingyuan of the Northern Song\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Perfection Section, Jade Exegesis Category\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture***\n\nComposed by Chen Jingyuan, Disciple of the Three Radiant Caverns of the Great Cavern, Perfected Master of True Stillness, and Recipient of the Purple Robe\n\nThe *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* hold a title of solemn reverence, standing foremost among the Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures. Its numinous verses and secret incantations, sealed in jade tablets and concealed in hidden writings, are recorded in full detail.\n\nSince the Western City’s Lord of Total Perfection and the Southern Culmen’s Purple Prime Lady bestowed it upon the Perfected One of Pure Emptiness, who in turn transmitted it to Madame Wei of Southern Marchmount, it has been said: “Should you not dwell in the mountains, concealing yourself in pure retreat and voiding the center through breath-regulation, then the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* must not be recited recklessly.”\n\nThe reason for this is that its wondrous tones resonate through nine heavens, its true sounds soar in lofty chant. The qi of its text intermingles with the Jade Void in profound mystery, its rosy savor harmonizes with the Great Yang in full splendor. When lips move to utter it, jade efflorescence instantly arrives; when its sacred lines are intoned, one joins in covenant with the Most High. In stillness, with hands clasped in reverence, the Purple Chamber reveals itself; in focused contemplation of one’s aspirations, all kindred spirits respond in resonance.\n\nThus, the seven ancestors gain blessings, receive registers of immortal palaces, transcend the ranks of hidden ghosts, and together feast in the Vermilion Mound. This scripture’s sublimity soars, steering the chariot of dawn’s ascent, riding the Way of the luminous dragon—far beyond the reach of those mired in the dust of mundane custom.\n\nShould one recite it while still entangled in worldly affairs, the Three Officials and the Northern Emperor will disrupt its tones, and the radiant listener, tainted by impure qi, will fail to attain the resplendent resonance of Supreme Clarity or harmonize the voice with the numinous chambers of the Purple Culmen.\n\nThe *Azure Essentials and Purple Writ* of the Central Yellow Venerable Lord states: “To behold the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* is to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.” Yet some who cultivate it accumulate years without fruition and then claim the scripture is not true. This is entirely due to their names lacking inscription on the Golden Tablet of the Eastern Flower or the Jade Slip of the Golden Watchtower. The true numina do not descend for them, and instead, celestial demons approach, resulting in no responsive efficacy. Though they may obtain spirit-scriptures, they will never succeed.\n\nHad they first memorialized the Golden Tablet to the Azure Palace and presented the Jade Slip to the Thearch-Emperor, securing the attendance of the Golden Dawn Jade Lads and the Western Flower Jade Maidens to guard the numinous text, and had all heavens and earths, the three realms, praised and chanted its verses ten thousand times—how could they not have evoked the response of the jade chariot and purple carriage?\n\nSince this scripture descended into the world, only the Perfected Yang and Xu of Mount Juqu and Master Sima the Refiner of Mount Wangwu, along with successive generations of eminent Daoist adepts, have adhered to its precepts, transmitting it through sworn covenants. The oral instructions for its recitation and the esoteric subtleties of its integration were secretly imparted, enabling them to inscribe their names in the golden register and tread the luminous paths of Supreme Clarity.\n\nYet today, the true wind has scattered and faded, false recluses dwell in mountain retreats, the standards of the Dao are unheard, the rites between master and disciple have lapsed, and the teachings have declined—nothing is more grievous than this.\n\nJingyuan left home in childhood, sought the Dao in youth, and wandered for thirty years, presiding over the essentials for over a decade. In old age, I returned to Mount Mao, built a hut, and engaged in repentance. I lamented my meager karmic affinity for the Dao and the weight of my worldly karma. Though I diligently studied the scriptures, I never encountered a true master. How could I dare unseal and recite the Cavern Scripture?\n\nThus, I purified body and mind, devoted myself to reverence and purity, and broadly sought ancient editions. First, I examined and verified them myself, poring over them in silence, repeatedly analyzing and constructing their meaning. Not a single phrase or character was overlooked.\n\nYet where two interpretations clashed, my perplexity only deepened—such as the case of *fa* (發) being miswritten as *fa yan* (發煙). Or where characters were altered in their components or forms, becoming confused and inconsistent—such as *qi* (栖) written as *@*, or *@* written as *ge* (歌).\n\nThis is because private copyists and illicit transmissions have perpetuated errors through successive generations. I have therefore taken the editions used by earlier practitioners—the Three Caverns Dharma Master, Master of Mystical Observation, Zhu Ziying, and the Three Caverns Dharma Master, Grand Master of Profound Mystery, Huangfu Xiji, both reciters of the Cavern Scripture and contemporaries of the Tiansheng era—as well as the editions preserved at Mount Mao’s repository. Comparing them with the hidden writings, I have compiled this phonetic gloss and exegesis, elucidating discrepancies and roughly resolving doubts. I dare not present this as definitive Dharma teaching, but merely record what I have examined for my own reference.\n\nAfter three months of purifying my heart in retreat, I transcribed a copy of the *Jade Exegesis of the Cavern Scripture*, which I now reverently contemplate morning and evening. I await the numinous ones to bestow it according to the proper precepts, thereby fulfilling my long-cherished aspiration.\n\n---\n\n**Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture**\n\nThe phonetic glosses for the *Hidden Writ of the Jade Concealment of the Demolishing-Mara Divine Wisdom*, the *Jade Annotations of the Dao Lord*, the *Cinnabar Chapters of the Purple Writ*, the *Returning to the Origin Supreme Method*, and the *Hundred Spirits Supreme Method* are provided herein.\n\n*Jue* (訣) means “oral instructions,” pronounced *jué* (决). Ancient editions wrote it as *jué* (决), but later scribes altered it to *jué* (訣). Other instances follow this pattern.\n\n*Yan jing* (晏景): the first character is pronounced *yàn* (宴). In ancient scriptures, *yan* (晏) and *yan* (宴) were interchangeable. Other instances follow this pattern.\n\n*Yan qin* (晏寝): the Mount Mao edition writes it as *qu qin* (曲寝).\n\n*Yu han* (玉翰): pronounced *hú àn* (胡岸切). The same character appears later in the text.\n\nJade-like rings (*juéjué*), rhyming with *yāng* (央), as seen in *Phonetic Glosses of All Daoist Scriptures* by Shi Chong, Grand Master of the Grand Clarity Abbey and Tang Court Gentleman for Splendid Happiness.\n\n*Rǎngjù* (攘據): the first character is pronounced *rǔ yáng qiè* (汝羊切), the second *jū yù qiè* (居御切), meaning \"to grasp.\"\n\n*Zhàngfān* (杖幡): the first character is pronounced *zhí liàng qiè* (直亮切), meaning \"to hold.\" Alternatively written as *仗* (*zhàng*), same pronunciation.\n\n*Shèxié* (攝邪): pronounced *sì jiē qiè* (似嗟切), ancient editions wrote it as *邪*.\n\n*Xílào* (檄落): the first character is pronounced *xíng dí qiè* (刑狄切), written as *激* (*jī*); in ancient calendars, it may also be written as *敷*.\n\n*Yúnao* (云璈): pronounced *áo* (遨).

Shi Chong pronounces it *miàn* (面).\n\n*Xiéshén piāo jīn pō* (协神飘津坡): Shi Chong writes it as *协晨* (*xié chén*).\n\n*Qiānzhǐ* (褰趾): the first character is pronounced *qù yān qiè* (去焉切), the second *zhǐ* (止), meaning \"foot.\" *褰* may also be written as *骞*.\n\n*Zǐpíng* (紫軿): pronounced *píng* (瓶), meaning \"chariot.\"\n\n*Yānsǎ* (烟洒): pronounced *suǒ xià qiè* (所下切). Shi Chong gives two pronunciations: *suǒ qǐ qiè* (所绮切) and *suǒ jì qiè* (所寄切), meaning \"to scatter\" or \"to fall.\"\n\n*Bāmíng* (八冥): pronounced *míng* (溟).\n\n*Miàoguān* (妙观): pronounced *gǔ duàn qiè* (古段切).\n\n*Bù běiyuán* (步北元): the Mount Mao edition writes it as *涉北元* (*shè běiyuán*).\n\n*Duōrì* (掇日): the first character is pronounced *duō huó qiè* (多活切).\n\n*Liángēng* (连更): pronounced *gēng* (庚).\n\n*Qīqī* (凄凄): pronounced *qī* (妻), or written as *凄*.\n\n*Mǎngmǎng* (莽莽): pronounced *mò dǎng qiè* (莫党切), describing a vast and boundless expanse.\n\n*Shùlái* (数来): the first character is pronounced *sè jù qiè* (色句切).\n\n*Chóngxū guǎn* (重虚馆): Shi Chong writes *馆* as *观* (*guàn*).\n\n*Yùsuǐ* (玉髓): pronounced *xī wěi qiè* (息委切).\n\n*Cānwén* (参闻): the first character is pronounced *cāng hán qiè* (仓含切); the second is pronounced as in *shēng cān tóng* (声参同).\n\n*Jiānshì* (监试): the first character is pronounced *gǔ xián qiè* (古衔切), meaning \"to oversee\"; the second character is the same as in *jiān tíng* (监庭).\n\n*Zàishèng* (载胜): pronounced *shēng* (升).

The *Shuowen* states it means \"to turn\"; the vulgar writing *迥* (*jiǒng*) is incorrect. Formerly written as *徊* (*huái*), describing a lingering, non-advancing motion. The *Shuowen* originally wrote it as *裴回* (*péihuí*), meaning \"loose robes,\" capturing the sense of their billowing. Other instances follow this pattern.\n\n*Chuòwù* (啜误): the first character is pronounced *zhū duō qiè* (株多切), meaning \"to chatter endlessly.\" Written as *掇* (*duō*) is incorrect.\n\n*Píngshēng* (平生): as defined in the *Shuowen*, \"to cease.\"\n\nHead-crown: pronounced *gǔ wàn qiè* (古玩切), a general term for ceremonial headdresses.

The *Shuowen* cites the *Book of Songs*: \"Fair eyes gaze brightly.\" Ancient versions write *盼* (*pàn*) and *眄* (*miǎn*) interchangeably as *眄* (*miǎn*). The *Shuowen* defines *眄* as \"eyes half-closed\" or \"sidelong glance,\" which conflicts with *盼*. Later interpretations resolve this by context.\n\nMusic Master: the first character is pronounced *luò* (洛); subsequent instances follow this.\n\nDissolution of Form: pronounced *hú mǎi qiè* (胡买切), meaning \"enlightenment.\"\n\nFour Emanations: Shi Chong pronounces it *shí yì qiè* (食亦切); some write it as *四谢* (*sìxiè*), which is incorrect.\n\nLofty Celestial Promontory: Shi Chong pronounces it *qí* (奇), meaning \"curved bank.\" Some versions write *琦* (*qí*).\n\nRoaring and Shouting: some write it as *咤* (*zhà*), pronounced *zhī jiā qiè* (知加切) or *zhì jià qiè* (陟嫁切).

The Mao Shan manuscript omits *元素*. This translation follows the Mao Shan manuscript.\n\nMale and Female Entrust Spirit to Transformation: some versions write *奇* (*qí*) for *寄* (*jì*).\n\nHundred Primes: pronounced *qí hún qiè* (奇混切).

According to the *Jade Annotations of the Dao Lord*: *Yì* (易) means \"goodness,\" and is the name of the northwestern gate of the Nine Heavens. Only after passing through the Gate of *Yì* may one ascend to the Assembly Chamber of the Imperial Hall. Here, though the character *室* (*shì*) harmonizes with the preceding rhyme, the *Jade Annotations* indicate *会* (*huì*) is correct.\n\nWave-Reaching Terrace: some versions write *彼建台* (*bǐ jiàn tái*).\n\n**Highest August Jade Vacuity Lord’s Scripture of the Dao, Second Chapter**\n\nFlaming: pronounced *yàn* (艳), meaning \"radiance.\"\n\nA Thousand Kalpas Begin One Cycle: some versions write *Ten Kalpas Begin One Cycle*.\n\n**August Jade Emperor Lord’s Scripture of the Dao, Third Chapter**\n\nThe Jade Emperor possesses the Darkest Highest Banner, which commands the steps of the Nine Heavens. The Mao Shan manuscript omits the character *之* (*zhī*).\n\nSeven Awakenings Uphold the Dao’s Numerology: According to the *Jade Annotations of the Dao Lord*, the Seven Awakenings deeply comprehend the obscure and brightly seek the dawn’s obscurity. Once the heart is illuminated, one knows to pursue the *Dao’s Numerology*. *Dao’s Numerology* refers to the affairs of the *Great Cavern Unity of the Perfected Sovereign*. Some versions write *Seven Awakenings Uphold Numerology Dao*, which is likely erroneous.\n\nWhirlwinds Gather at the Northern Flourishing Hua, Purple Blossoms Sing at the Eastern *＠*, Jade Chimes Harmonize Beyond the Nine Skies, Jade Tallies Summon the Grand Tenuity. The character *＠* is not included in the rhyme schemes of this text, and no pronunciation can be provided. According to the *Scripture on Dispelling Demons, Entering Samadhi Chapter*: *Whirlwinds gleam at the flourishing Lang Hua, Purple Cassia how serene! Jade fruits resound beyond the Nine Skies, Jade tablets summon the Grand Tenuity.* The meaning aligns with the *Cavern Scripture*, suggesting *＠* is a scribal error for *栖* (*qī*).\n\nLuminous Splendor: pronounced *yū wù qiè* (纡勿切). Shi Chong pronounces it *yū wèi qiè* (纡胃切), meaning \"elegance.\" Subsequent instances follow this.\n\nVast and Subtle Divine Radiance: some versions write *云* (*yún*) for *灵* (*líng*). According to the *Jade Annotations of the Dao Lord*: *Without seeking the subtle cloud radiance, the Golden Chamber cannot be ascended; without reciting the Cavern Chapters, the Jade Guest cannot be seen.* Here, the meanings of *Divine Radiance* and *Cloud Radiance* remain unresolved. This translation follows Huangfu’s version as *灵* (*líng*), pending further inquiry from the Perfected Master.\n\nForest-Sprinkled: Shi Chong pronounces it *suǒ yí qiè* (所宜切).\n\nEmpty Purity Hua: Shi Chong states this is the original name. Huangfu’s version writes *青* (*qīng*).\n\nPearl-Lush Net: some versions write *殊* (*shū*) for *珠* (*zhū*).\n\n**Highest August Master Purple Dawn Lord’s Scripture of the Dao, Fourth Chapter**\n\nLeft No-Blossom Duke, Mysterious Fullness Uncle: some versions write *玄元叔* (*Xuán Yuán Shū*).\n\nFeminine Unity Jade Tablet of the Five Elders Scripture: also called *Mysterious Fullness Uncle*.\n\n**Great Elixir Hidden Writ of the Cavern-True Mystery Scripture**, also called *Mysterious Fullness Uncle*, hence its two names.\n\n*Divine Pass* beneath the *Great Desert*: ancient versions write *mó* (摸).\n*Misty Dimness*: pronounced *mò pèi* (莫佩切), meaning faint obscurity.\n*Mysterious Mystery Uncle Fire King*: the *Great Elixir Hidden Writ* states: *Lower Mystery Lord Uncle Fire King*, styled *Right Revolving Radiance*. *King*: some versions write *Jade*.\n*Mysterious Cavern’s Four Directions*: some versions write *Cavern One Four Directions*.\nStyled *Àn Yánchāng*: some versions write *Ān Yánchāng*.\n*Hé Yīng*.\n\nThe *Great Elixir Hidden Writ* states: *Azure Qi Lord Àn Yánchāng*, styled *Harmonious Infant*.\n*Ever Gazing*: ancient versions write [lacuna].\n*Dharma Without Wheel*: some versions write *Departing Without Wheel*.\n\n**Fifth Scripture of the Highest August Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity**\n*Cavern-Yang’s Lush Spirit-Treasure, Soul-Generating Golden Radiance within Qi’s Essence*: some versions write *yào yào* (耀耀) for *huàn huàn* (焕焕).\n*Uprooting Planting for Posterity’s Afflictions*: some versions write *Uprooting Perishing for Posterity’s Afflictions*.\nShi Chong’s rhyme: pronounced *huán* (还).\n*Hewing Severance*: Shi Chong’s first character *zhī* (之) pronounced *yào* (药切), the second *duàn* (断) pronounced *guǎn* (管切). The latter *duàn* (断) and *luò* (落) are synonymous.\n*Luminous Brightness Seven-Generation Descendants*: some versions write *huá* (华) for *yè* (叶); Huangfu’s version writes *Míngmíng Qī Yè Sūn* (明明七叶孙); Mao Shan’s version writes *Wěngmíng* (奣明). Shi Chong’s pronunciation and meaning also write *wěng* (奣), pronounced *wēng* (乌猛切).\nAccording to the Perfected’s hidden taboos: *Upper Mystery True Radiance Dao Lord*, taboo name *Wěngméng* (奣萌). *Jíyùn* (集韵) reads *gǔ měng* (古猛切), meaning *bright*. Homophonous with *kuàng* (矿).\n*Bóshā Xuán* (＠沙玄): *＠* is homophonous with *bó* (孛).\n\n**Sixth Scripture of the Three Origins Purple Essence Lord**\n*Bones Possess Jade Blossoms*: some versions write *yìng* (映).\n*Born in Joy*: pronounced *luò* (洛).\n*Jade Immortal*: *Jade*: some versions write *Five*.\n\n**Seventh Scripture of the True Yang Origin Elder Mysterious Unity Lord**\n*Arising Not Grasping the Staff*: *Mud-Pellet Red Child Right Minister Heavenly Emperor*, named *Qǐ Fēi* (起非); some versions write *Pái* (排).\n*Guarding Against Dust-Waves*: some versions write *Pacifying Against Dust-Waves*.\n*Supreme Timeliness Not-Son*: some versions write *Supreme Timeliness Above Not-Son*.\n\n**Eighth Scripture of the Upper Origin Grand Simplicity Three Origins Lord**\n*Golden Talisman Summons the Transcendent Minister*: some versions write *Xiāng* (乡), likely for rhyme’s sake.\n*Highest Vanquisher of Demons Jade Purity King*: Huangfu’s and Mao Shan’s versions both follow the above; some versions write *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Purity King*.\n*He who knows me attains long life; he who preserves me knows no decay*: some versions write *He who knows me lives; he who preserves me knows no decay*.\n*Relying on Repelling the Unjust*: *Relying*: some versions write *Serving*.\n*Flanking Me*: Shi Chong states the upper character should be *jiā* (夹), meaning *to attend*.\n*Kerchiefed in Gold, Girded with Feathers*: the first character *jīn* (巾) pronounced *xìn* (焮切), meaning to cover the head with a kerchief. *Xìn* (焮) pronounced *xiāng zhǎn* (香斩切).\nThe *Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* states: *Kerchiefed in Gold* is the name of the Heavenly Perfected’s cap-kerchief. Its design remains unrecorded.\n\n**Ninth Scripture of the Upper Clarity Purple Essence Three Simplicities Lord**\n\nMy body sprouts feathered robes, ascending in flight to the Nine Heavens’ thoroughfare—one version omits *my*. Now, according to collation: including *my* completes the phrasing and sense.\n\nWithin the Purple Essence’s Flourishing Forest, the *Dao Lord’s Jade Commentary* states: In the Heaven of Upper Clarity’s Purple Essence, there stands a tree whose leaves resemble bamboo yet are crimson, whose blossoms resemble mirrors yet gleam, whose fruits resemble plums yet bear no pit. This is called the Flourishing Forest of Nurtured Splendor. Eating its leaves averts hunger; eating its blossoms confers immortality; eating its fruits grants flight as an immortal. This is what is meant by *crimson trees and cinnabar fruits, their hues illuminating the five viscera*. One version writes *Flourishing* as *Verdant*.\n\n*Cang King*—one version writes *Azure Jade*. *Guarding this Long Night Assembly*—*Guarding*: one version writes *Gradually*. *Thick-lipped*, pronounced *chún*. *The Five Elders hold the sun in their mouths*, *hold* pronounced *zhì*.\n\n**Tenth Scripture of the Azure Numinous Yang Peace Primordial Lord**\n*Gazing toward Prosperity’s Exhaustion*—one version writes *Visiting*. *Linked kalpas give birth*—*kalpas*: one version writes *bó*.\n\n**Tenth Scripture of the August Clarity Cavern-Realized Dao Lord**\n*Jade Clarity Cavern-Luminous Womb King*—one version omits *Luminous*. *Returning Simplicity fills*—one version writes *Primordial*. *Long Heaven gives birth*—one version writes *Long Life Heaven*. *Upright Flourishing Branches*—these three characters are the inner names of the Three Primordial Lords. When reciting to this point, silently intone them thrice. The above nineteen characters appear in the Huangfu edition; other versions are all deficient.\n\n**Twelfth Scripture of the Highest Great Simplicity Lord**\nTitled *Northern Terrace Lord*—one version omits *Lord*. *Returning Gold to the Great Radiance Land*—one version writes *Minister*. *Sun’s Brightness Eight Ascensions*—the *Secret Essentials of Cultivating Perfection* states: The Perfected Lord within the sun is styled *Lofty Ascending Brightness*. One version writes *Sun’s Splendor Eight Ascensions*. The *Dao Lord’s Jade Commentary* states: *Sun’s Splendor* is the name of the sun’s spirit; *Eight Ascensions* is the name of a tree within the moon. There are eight such trees, all dwelling in the moon. Now, the meanings of *Brightness* and *Splendor* remain unresolved; here we follow Huangfu’s version, writing *Brightness*. *Harmonizing Return to Fall*—one version writes *Fall* as *End*. *Knots unfurl eternally*—one version writes *Knots* as *Auspicious*.\n\n**Thirteenth Scripture of the August Supreme Four Elders Within the Dao Lord**\n*Revolving winds blend the Emperor’s heart*—one version writes *Lingering winds blend the Emperor’s heart*. Titled *Longevity’s Leisurely Abundance*—one version writes *Assistance*.

Only the edition transmitted by Master Guanmiao, a *Three Caverns* Dharma Master, preserves this title, *Central Yellow Thearch Containing Radiance Dew*, thereby completing the visualization method. Further inquiries were made by the Perfected Master Geng.\n\n*Double Veil*—the first character read in the *zhí-lóng* tone, the second pronounced *mì*; a cloth covering for food, also written as *幎*.\n*Robes*—the first character pronounced *pī*.\n*Girdle Pendant*—the first character read in the *yāo* tone; some versions write *waist*.\n*Embroidered Cloak*—Shi Chong harmonizes the rhyme, pronouncing it *pī*.\n*Canopy*—the first character read in the *yú-bēi* tone; a tent.\n*Lan-gan*—pronounced *lán* or *gān*.\n*Revolving Repository*—read in the departing tone.\n*Loom*—one version writes *mechanism*.\n*Circulating the Grand Unity*—one version writes *penetrating circulation*.\n*Generating the Two Modes in Equilibrium*—one version writes *Two Modes*.\n*Feeding Mud*—the first character pronounced *bù*.\n*Primordial Simplicity Lord of Shared Heart*—one version writes *qi* for *simplicity*.\n*Enthroned as a Celestial Lord*—one version writes *Grand* for *Celestial*.\n*Unlocking the Flower of Spirit*—one version writes *closing* for *unlocking*.\n*Grand Epoch Primordium*—one version writes *Great* for *Grand*.\n\n**Thirty-Eighth Scripture of the Grand Primordium Dawn Center Lord, Engraved in the Jade Portal of the Grotto Palace on Mount Emei, the Grand Simplicity Lord**\n*Emei*—alternatively written as *Emei*.\n*Imperial Minister Inscribing Essence*—one version writes *diligence* for *inscribing*.\n*Threefold Splendor Bough*—pronounced *gē*.\n*Grand Primordium Grand Simplicity Cavern Radiance Dark Mystery*—According to the *Jade Commentary* of the Perfected Lord: *Grand Nonbeing* lies beyond *Cavern Radiance*; *Grand Simplicity* resides above *Dark Mystery*. The Nine Palaces array their Golden Gates in the heavens of *Grand Simplicity*, while the Vermilion Towers stand sevenfold in the courts of *Grand Nonbeing*. One version writes *Grand Simplicity Cavern Radiance, Emerging from Darkness and Entering Mystery*, which appears erroneous.\n*Three and Five Flowing Transformations*—one version writes *flowing distribution*, likely for rhyme, though the following text already contains *the hundred spirits proclaim*, and the Huangfu edition also writes *transformations*.\n*White Prime Overseer of the Moon’s Dusk*—one version writes *moon’s measure*; another, *moonlit night*.\n*Profound Mystery Subtle Awakening*—one version writes *subtle* for *subtle mystery*.\n\n**Thirty-Ninth Scripture of the Ninefold Numinous Perfected Immortal Mother of the Western Prime Tortoise Mountain, the Azure Gold Elixir Empress**\n*Infant Ignorance*—ancient scriptures often write *蒙*; Shi Chong pronounces it *méng*.\n*Branches*—Shi Chong explains: *accumulated branches* means *accumulated generations*.\n*Flourishing*—read in the *suǒ-zhēn* tone; an appearance of abundance.\n*Receiving the Luminous Descent*—one version writes *descend* for *descent*.\n\nAccording to the second fascicle of the *Concealed Instructions on Ascending Perfection*, in the section on *Scriptural and Commentarial Conventions*: The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* now circulates in two versions. One is a large scroll, prefaced by the *Method of Revolving Wind and Blending Union*, but its diction and purport are spurious and deceptive. The other consists solely of thirty-nine chapters, within which a few passages align with those spoken by the *Right Consort*, yet they are intermingled and indistinguishable. Only by personally examining the authentic edition can one follow it properly. It is also said that those who obtained the thirty-nine chapters of Yang and Xu found them no different from the common small edition. Since I have not seen it with my own eyes, I cannot judge its authenticity, but it is fitting to transcribe it to complete the catalog. There is also a *Jade Commentary* in one fascicle, which briefly explicates the essentials of the *Cavern Scripture* and may likewise be copied.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Azure Essentials Purple Writ of the Golden Root Scripture*, the Central Yellow Venerable Lord states: Whoever beholds the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Chapters* shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Yet some who cultivate it achieve no success after years of practice and claim the scripture is not authentic. This is entirely due to their failure to present a *Golden Tablet* to the Azure Palace or offer a *Jade Memorandum* to the Thearch. Without the descent of true numina, they are instead visited by celestial demons, thus yielding no response and vainly obtaining only spirit scriptures, which likewise lead to no accomplishment. Had they first memorialized the *Golden Tablet* at the Azure Palace and presented the *Jade Memorandum* to the Thearch, receiving the attendance of the *Golden Dawn Jade Lads* and *Western Flower Jade Maidens* to guard the numinous writ, and had it universally proclaimed throughout the heavens so that the Three Realms extolled its virtue and chanted its verses ten thousand times—how could they fail to evoke the response of jade chariots and purple carriages?\n\nHere ends the *Jade Instructions on the Sounds and Meanings of the Great Cavern Perfect Scripture of Highest Clarity*.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the *Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*\n**Author:** Daoist Chen Jingyuan of the Northern Song\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Perfection Section, Jade Exegesis Category\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture***\n\nComposed by Chen Jingyuan, Disciple of the Three Radiant Caverns of the Great Cavern, Perfected Master of True Stillness, and Recipient of the Purple Robe\n\nThe *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* hold a title of solemn reverence, standing foremost among the Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures. Its numinous verses and secret incantations, sealed in jade tablets and concealed in hidden writings, are recorded in full detail.\n\nSince the Western City’s Lord of Total Perfection and the Southern Culmen’s Purple Prime Lady bestowed it upon the Perfected One of Pure Emptiness, who in turn transmitted it to Madame Wei of Southern Marchmount, it has been said: “Should you not dwell in the mountains, concealing yourself in pure retreat and voiding the center through breath-regulation, then the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* must not be recited recklessly.”\n\nThe reason for this is that its wondrous tones resonate through nine heavens, its true sounds soar in lofty chant. The qi of its text intermingles with the Jade Void in profound mystery, its rosy savor harmonizes with the Great Yang in full splendor. When lips move to utter it, jade efflorescence instantly arrives; when its sacred lines are intoned, one joins in covenant with the Most High. In stillness, with hands clasped in reverence, the Purple Chamber reveals itself; in focused contemplation of one’s aspirations, all kindred spirits respond in resonance.\n\nThus, the seven ancestors gain blessings, receive registers of immortal palaces, transcend the ranks of hidden ghosts, and together feast in the Vermilion Mound. This scripture’s sublimity soars, steering the chariot of dawn’s ascent, riding the Way of the luminous dragon—far beyond the reach of those mired in the dust of mundane custom.\n\nShould one recite it while still entangled in worldly affairs, the Three Officials and the Northern Emperor will disrupt its tones, and the radiant listener, tainted by impure qi, will fail to attain the resplendent resonance of Supreme Clarity or harmonize the voice with the numinous chambers of the Purple Culmen.\n\nThe *Azure Essentials and Purple Writ* of the Central Yellow Venerable Lord states: “To behold the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* is to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.” Yet some who cultivate it accumulate years without fruition and then claim the scripture is not true. This is entirely due to their names lacking inscription on the Golden Tablet of the Eastern Flower or the Jade Slip of the Golden Watchtower. The true numina do not descend for them, and instead, celestial demons approach, resulting in no responsive efficacy. Though they may obtain spirit-scriptures, they will never succeed.\n\nHad they first memorialized the Golden Tablet to the Azure Palace and presented the Jade Slip to the Thearch-Emperor, securing the attendance of the Golden Dawn Jade Lads and the Western Flower Jade Maidens to guard the numinous text, and had all heavens and earths, the three realms, praised and chanted its verses ten thousand times—how could they not have evoked the response of the jade chariot and purple carriage?\n\nSince this scripture descended into the world, only the Perfected Yang and Xu of Mount Juqu and Master Sima the Refiner of Mount Wangwu, along with successive generations of eminent Daoist adepts, have adhered to its precepts, transmitting it through sworn covenants. The oral instructions for its recitation and the esoteric subtleties of its integration were secretly imparted, enabling them to inscribe their names in the golden register and tread the luminous paths of Supreme Clarity.\n\nYet today, the true wind has scattered and faded, false recluses dwell in mountain retreats, the standards of the Dao are unheard, the rites between master and disciple have lapsed, and the teachings have declined—nothing is more grievous than this.\n\nJingyuan left home in childhood, sought the Dao in youth, and wandered for thirty years, presiding over the essentials for over a decade. In old age, I returned to Mount Mao, built a hut, and engaged in repentance. I lamented my meager karmic affinity for the Dao and the weight of my worldly karma. Though I diligently studied the scriptures, I never encountered a true master. How could I dare unseal and recite the Cavern Scripture?\n\nThus, I purified body and mind, devoted myself to reverence and purity, and broadly sought ancient editions. First, I examined and verified them myself, poring over them in silence, repeatedly analyzing and constructing their meaning. Not a single phrase or character was overlooked.\n\nYet where two interpretations clashed, my perplexity only deepened—such as the case of *fa* (發) being miswritten as *fa yan* (發煙). Or where characters were altered in their components or forms, becoming confused and inconsistent—such as *qi* (栖) written as *@*, or *@* written as *ge* (歌).\n\nThis is because private copyists and illicit transmissions have perpetuated errors through successive generations. I have therefore taken the editions used by earlier practitioners—the Three Caverns Dharma Master, Master of Mystical Observation, Zhu Ziying, and the Three Caverns Dharma Master, Grand Master of Profound Mystery, Huangfu Xiji, both reciters of the Cavern Scripture and contemporaries of the Tiansheng era—as well as the editions preserved at Mount Mao’s repository. Comparing them with the hidden writings, I have compiled this phonetic gloss and exegesis, elucidating discrepancies and roughly resolving doubts. I dare not present this as definitive Dharma teaching, but merely record what I have examined for my own reference.\n\nAfter three months of purifying my heart in retreat, I transcribed a copy of the *Jade Exegesis of the Cavern Scripture*, which I now reverently contemplate morning and evening. I await the numinous ones to bestow it according to the proper precepts, thereby fulfilling my long-cherished aspiration.\n\n---\n\n**Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture**\n\nThe phonetic glosses for the *Hidden Writ of the Jade Concealment of the Demolishing-Mara Divine Wisdom*, the *Jade Annotations of the Dao Lord*, the *Cinnabar Chapters of the Purple Writ*, the *Returning to the Origin Supreme Method*, and the *Hundred Spirits Supreme Method* are provided herein.\n\n*Jue* (訣) means “oral instructions,” pronounced *jué* (决). Ancient editions wrote it as *jué* (决), but later scribes altered it to *jué* (訣). Other instances follow this pattern.\n\n*Yan jing* (晏景): the first character is pronounced *yàn* (宴). In ancient scriptures, *yan* (晏) and *yan* (宴) were interchangeable. Other instances follow this pattern.\n\n*Yan qin* (晏寝): the Mount Mao edition writes it as *qu qin* (曲寝).\n\n*Yu han* (玉翰): pronounced *hú àn* (胡岸切). The same character appears later in the text.",

One is a large scroll, prefaced by the *Method of Revolving Wind and Blending Union*, but its diction and purport are spurious and deceptive. The other consists solely of thirty-nine chapters, within which a few passages align with those spoken by the *Right Consort*, yet they are intermingled and indistinguishable. Only by personally examining the authentic edition can one follow it properly. It is also said that those who obtained the thirty-nine chapters of Yang and Xu found them no different from the common small edition. Since I have not seen it with my own eyes, I cannot judge its authenticity, but it is fitting to transcribe it to complete the catalog. There is also a *Jade Commentary* in one fascicle, which briefly explicates the essentials of the *Cavern Scripture* and may likewise be copied.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Azure Essentials Purple Writ of the Golden Root Scripture*, the Central Yellow Venerable Lord states: Whoever beholds the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Chapters* shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Yet some who cultivate it achieve no success after years of practice and claim the scripture is not authentic. This is entirely due to their failure to present a *Golden Tablet* to the Azure Palace or offer a *Jade Memorandum* to the Thearch. Without the descent of true numina, they are instead visited by celestial demons, thus yielding no response and vainly obtaining only spirit scriptures, which likewise lead to no accomplishment. Had they first memorialized the *Golden Tablet* at the Azure Palace and presented the *Jade Memorandum* to the Thearch, receiving the attendance of the *Golden Dawn Jade Lads* and *Western Flower Jade Maidens* to guard the numinous writ, and had it universally proclaimed throughout the heavens so that the Three Realms extolled its virtue and chanted its verses ten thousand times—how could they fail to evoke the response of jade chariots and purple carriages?\n\nHere ends the *Jade Instructions on the Sounds and Meanings of the Great Cavern Perfect Scripture of Highest Clarity*.",
