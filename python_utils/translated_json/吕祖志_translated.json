Some accounts place his birth in Puban, others in Hedong. His great-grandfather, Lü Yanzhi, served as Military Commissioner of Zhedong; his grandfather, Lü Wei, as Vice Minister of Rites; and his father, Lü Rang, as Prefect of Haizhou.\n\nHe was born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the fourteenth year of the Zhenyuan reign (at the *si* hour). As his mother lay in childbed, a rare fragrance filled the chamber, celestial music drifted through the air, and a white crane descended from the heavens, entering the bed-curtains before vanishing. At birth, his form was golden, his essence wooden—possessing the bones of a Daoist immortal and the bearing of a transcendent. His head resembled a crane’s, his back a tortoise’s; his body was that of a tiger, his jaws those of a dragon. His brows were layered like green ridges, his phoenix eyes angled toward his temples. His neck was long, his forehead broad, his face round, his nose straight and prominent. His complexion was yellowish-white, with a black mole at the corner of his left brow and another beneath his left eye, each the size of a *gongcao* official’s seal. The soles of his feet bore raised patterns resembling tortoise-shell markings.\n\nFrom childhood, he was exceptionally intelligent, memorizing ten thousand words in a day and composing essays extemporaneously. In adulthood, he stood five *chi* and two *cun* tall. He favored the Huayang cap, wore a yellowish-white bordered robe, and tied a broad black sash, bearing a striking resemblance to Zhang Zifang.\n\nHe remained unmarried until the age of twenty. While still in swaddling clothes, Ma Zu saw him and remarked: \"This child’s bone structure is extraordinary—he is surely a being beyond the mundane world. When the time comes, he will dwell where he encounters a hut and strike where he sees a bell. Remember this well.\"\n\nLater, while traveling on Mount Lu, he first met Fire Dragon Perfected, who transmitted to him the Heavenly Escape Sword Method. Thereafter, he mingled with common folk, selling ink among the people, and styled himself the Pure Yang Master. During the Xiantong era, he passed the imperial examinations; some say he did so in the Kaicheng era at the age of sixty-four. Others claim he first awakened to the Dao at fifty, and that when the sixty-four hexagrams were exhausted, he began anew with *Qian*—a sign of pure yang’s resonance.\n\nLater, while frequenting a wineshop in Chang’an, he saw a feathered immortal wearing a black headscarf and white robe, his long beard and bright eyes refined, a purple ornament in hand and a large gourd hanging at his waist. The immortal inscribed three quatrains on the wall:\n\n**I.**\nSitting or lying, ever clutching a jug of wine,\nI let not my eyes know the imperial capital.\nVast as heaven and earth, yet nameless,\nA carefree man among men.\n\n**II.**\nTrue immortals who have attained the Dao are seldom met—\nWhen shall I return, and would you follow?\nI say my dwelling borders the azure sea,\nThe first peak of Penglai, apart from all.\n\n**III.**\nDo not weary of laughter and joyous talk,\nFor parting and chaos weigh heavy on the mind.\nCounting on my fingers from the start,\nHow many have lived to see true peace?\n\nStartled by the immortal’s imposing and ancient appearance, as well as the soaring spirit of his verses, Dongbin bowed and asked his name. The immortal replied: \"My surname is Zhongli, my given name Quan, and my courtesy name Yunfang.\" Dongbin bowed again and invited him to sit. The extraordinary man said: \"Compose a quatrain for me, that I may see your skill.\" Dongbin’s brush did not pause as he wrote twenty-eight characters:\n\nBorn into a Confucian family in peaceful times,\nThe weight of office chains me, while common cloth feels light.\nWho in this world would vie for fame and profit?\nI serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nDelighted by the poem, Yunfang said: \"My dwelling lies on Crane Ridge in Zhongnan. Would you follow me there?\" Dongbin thus accompanied Yunfang to rest at the wineshop. Yunfang rose to prepare the meal, but Dongbin suddenly grew drowsy, resting his head on the table in a doze. He dreamed he was a scholar traveling to the capital, passing the imperial examinations as *zhuangyuan*. Beginning as a minor official in the provinces, he rose through the ranks—censor, academician, drafter of imperial decrees, secretary in the Hanlin Academy, and other prestigious posts—experiencing every promotion and demotion. Twice he married daughters of wealthy families, his weddings and offspring flourishing, his household filled with heirs and in-laws. For nearly forty years, he held power, his influence scorching like blackened iron. Then, abruptly, he was charged with grave crimes: his family’s wealth was confiscated, his wives and children scattered, and he was exiled to the southern frontier, left destitute and emaciated. Standing alone in the wind and snow, he sighed deeply—only to awaken with a start. Yunfang stood beside him, the millet still uncooked, and laughed: \"The millet is not yet done, yet you’ve dreamed your way to Huaxu.\" Dongbin exclaimed: \"Do you know my dream?\" Yunfang replied: \"The dream you just had—its rises and falls, its glories and sorrows, all fifty years of it—passed in an instant. Gain is not worth rejoicing over, nor loss worth grieving. Only after great awakening does one realize that the affairs of this world are but a grand dream.\" Dongbin, moved and sighing, understood that the official path was not worth clinging to. He bowed again and said: \"Master, you are no ordinary man. I beg you to guide me toward transcending the world.\" Yunfang feigned reluctance: \"Your bones are not yet perfected, your resolve and conduct still lacking. If you seek transcendence, you must endure several more lifetimes.\" With that, he departed in a flutter, leaving Dongbin disheartened and lost. Dongbin abandoned his official post and retreated into seclusion.\n\nThereafter, Yunfang tested Dongbin ten times, and he passed every trial (to be recounted later). One day, a man descended with a clap of laughter—it was Yunfang. He said to Dongbin: \"The dust of the world is hard to erase, and true immortal talent is rare. My search for a worthy disciple is more urgent than others’ search for me. You have passed my ten trials—attaining the Dao is assured. Yet your merits and deeds remain incomplete. I now bestow upon you the secret alchemical method of transforming base metals into gold and silver, that you may aid the world and benefit all beings. When your three thousand merits are fulfilled and your eight hundred deeds perfected, I will return to guide you.\" Dongbin asked: \"Will the gold and silver thus created ever revert to their original form?\" Yunfang replied: \"After three thousand years, they will return to their base nature.\" Dongbin frowned: \"To mislead people three thousand years hence is not what I wish.\" Yunfang smiled: \"With such a heart, your three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are already complete.\" He then revealed to Dongbin the origins of his own attainment: he had once met the Perfected Lord of Bitter Bamboo, who told him, \"When you journey among mortals, if you encounter a man with two mouths, he shall be your disciple.\" Later, he roamed mountains and seas but never found such a person. Now, upon examining your surname, it truly matches the prophecy of Bitter Bamboo.\" He added: \"Will you follow me?\" Dongbin accompanied him to Crane Ridge, where they came upon a small grotto, its entrance aglow with starlight and moonlight, the surroundings utterly still. Yunfang took Dongbin’s hand, and after just a few steps, it seemed as though they rode swift horses across mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at the southern gate of the grotto, its lock thick with dust. Yunfang tied a green silk cord to Dongbin’s sash, and together they slipped through the crack in the door. Suddenly, the space opened wide. Ascending a high peak, they reached a great grotto gate, where two tigers crouched as guardians. Yunfang shouted, and the tigers lay motionless. He led Dongbin inside, where golden towers and jade terraces stood amid rare birds and jade-like trees, the radiance dazzling, the climate as mild as spring. They sat upon a rock, drinking three cups of Primordial Harmony wine and discoursing on the Dao. Before long, a maiden in green appeared, her double buns adorned with golden bells, her crimson skirt and emerald sleeves trailing, her cloud-patterned shoes and jade pendants tinkling, an extraordinary fragrance wafting about her. In her hands she held a jade tablet inscribed in gold: \"The immortals have gathered in the Upper Palace of Penglai. The Master is summoned to the Heavenly Pond Assembly to discuss the spiritual travels of the Five Origin Perfected.\"\n\nYunfang prepared to depart, and Dongbin saw him off with a poem:\n\n*\"To meet once you’ve attained the Dao is rare indeed,\nNow eastward you go to the immortal altar’s seat.\nA staff tipped with spring’s hues and a gourd of wine,\nA cloud-piercing cap that crowns the Five Peaks’ shrine.\nThe sea-turtle’s child—none know its face,\nThe mountain-burning talisman—ghosts dare not trace.\nWhen you are gone, this frame must age and fade,\nI beg you grant this poor scholar the bone-changing jade.\"*\n\nThis was his fear—that Yunfang might not return.\n\nYunfang replied, *\"Stay here, for I shall not be long.\"* Then, facing southeast, he ascended upon a purple cloud, drifting slowly away.\n\nDongbin took the plain-bound scrolls Yunfang had left him, unrolling and reciting them as he dwelled alone in the cave. Ten days later, Yunfang returned and asked, *\"You have been in solitude here—do you not long for home?\"*\n\nDongbin answered, *\"Having resolved my heart to study the Dao, how could I yearn for the mountains of the world?\"*\n\nYunfang said, *\"Excellent, excellent! You do not yet grasp the subtleties of yin and yang’s union and division. Clinging to yin alone makes one but a po, while preserving yang alone makes one but a hun. If you can gather the yang-hun to merge with the yin-po, so that yin and yang meet and hun and po become one in truth, then you are a Perfected.\"*\n\nDongbin asked, *\"Hun and po dwell in darkness—how can one preserve the form when the principle runs so deep?\"*\n\nThe Master replied, *\"When wisdom arises from obscurity and the spirit settles in perfect stillness, once spirit and essence merge, how could one not unite with the Real? A golden form and jade substance arise from utmost sincerity. When the Great Elixir is complete, the body becomes light as flight.\"*\n\nFrom then on, Dongbin posed ten questions on the cultivation of truth (recorded later), and Yunfang imparted to him all the profound secrets of the Supreme Perfected, utterly dispelling the dust and filth of the world. Soon, someone knocked at the door—it was Zheng Siyuan of Qingxi and the Perfected Shi of Mount Taihua, arriving from the southeast. They walked as if treading empty air, their forms suffused with golden and azure radiance. Greeting one another, they sat together, and Zheng said, *\"We have been apart too long! We had just come from Yin Siyi’s alchemical furnace and thought to visit your immortal gate.\"*\n\nThe Perfected Shi asked, *\"Who is this attendant?\"*\n\nThe Master replied, *\"The son of Lü Rang of Haizhou in our dynasty. In his youth, he studied the Confucian classics but failed in the capital. By chance, he met me in a wineshop in Chang’an and followed me into the Dao, mastering the subtleties of yin and yang, refining form and spirit to enter the wondrous.\"*\n\nDongbin bowed to the two guests, and Zheng and Yin said, *\"His form is pure, his spirit present, his eyes bright, his essence concealed. If you wish to escape the world’s snares, let us hear a poem from you.\"* They presented Dongbin with a golden brush, a rosy-clouded writing mat, divine glue, and a rhinoceros-horn inkstone. Dongbin immediately composed a poem:\n\n*\"Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives I came to this,\nOnly now does this body begin to feel light as flight.\nBeyond the clouds and mountains, I left home and country behind,\nRefining po and perfecting hun with the sun and moon’s essence refined.\nI have heard the Perfected discourse on the Nine Cauldrons’ might,\nAnd seek the Great Elixir through the Three Clarities’ height.\nNow, having met a true immortal face to face,\nMy name is entered in the Purple Palace’s immortal space.\"*\n\nThe three guests exchanged glances, marveling at his talent and the beauty of his lines. As spring birds chirped, the Master said to Dongbin, *\"Write something at the cave’s entrance.\"*\n\nDongbin inscribed:\n*\"Spring’s breath fills the sky, flower-dew drips,\nMorning sun strikes the sea, peaks’ clouds drift.\"*\n\nThe Master then said, *\"My audience at the Primordial Court draws near. The feathered guests of the Ten Isles will report these merits at the Jade Capital to ascend the immortal ranks. You may not remain long in this cave. We shall meet again in ten years at Dongting Lake.\"* Taking up a brush, he swiftly wrote sixteen characters on the cave’s stone wall:\n\n*\"By day, lofty and bright,\nBy night, the moon full and clear.\nYin and yang, hun and spirit,\nMerge and ascend together.\"*\n\nTossing the brush aside, he told Dongbin, *\"As you wander the world, practice the Dao of benefiting and saving others. When your merit is complete and your work fulfilled, we shall meet again.\"*\n\nThen Yunfang transmitted to Dongbin the *Lingbao Bifa* (*Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure*). Originally, Yunfang had obtained the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* in three sections from a stone wall on Mount Zhongnan: the *Upper Section: Golden Decrees of the Primordial Beginning*, the *Middle Section: Jade Records of the Sun-Origin Sovereign*, and the *Lower Section: True Principles of the Supreme Perfected*—altogether several thousand scrolls. Yunfang distilled their essence into the *Bifa*, dividing it into twelve branches and six principles. It expounded how yin contains yang and yang contains yin, the Dao of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent; how qi generates water and water generates qi, the mechanism of heart and kidney’s union. It used the eight trigrams to move the twelve hours, with its crux in *gen*; the three fields to interact and revolve, with its crux in the *niwan*. As for the initial practice, it provisionally likened it to swallowing qi and rinsing the saliva—but the true oral instructions lay in mind-to-mind transmission, not in written words.\n\nYunfang then showed Dongbin several grains of numinous elixir, saying, *\"These are not the world’s five metals or eight minerals, but a compound of the world’s rarest treasures. Though they have substance, they are formless—like clouds, like fire, like light, like shadows, visible yet intangible. When consumed, they merge with a person’s hun and consciousness into one, light and subtle, not like an elixir of tangible form.\"* He then presented a poem:\n\n*\"I know you possess a heroic and numinous bone,\nSo I teach you the heart’s state of vagueness and haze.\nIn the Crystal Palace atop the Hall of Embracing Primordial,\nI clearly point out the grotto-heaven of immortals’ ways.\nA true man, meeting the true formula, must hold fast with a fierce heart.\nThe five phases match like a knife’s edge—grasp the inverted turtle-snake art.\nThe Three Corpses’ spirits must be cast out,\nAdvancing and retreating, the celestial mechanism shines, the six thieves routed.\nKnow the Three Essentials, and the ten thousand spirits return,\nCome riding the fire dragon, departing the Nine Gates’ turn.\nWhen the nine-by-nine Dao reaches completion and you become true,\nThe Three Realms and Four Palaces will celebrate your Primordial Festival’s due.\nQi soars, spirit ever steadfast,\nPenglai is but my home’s vastness.\nThe assembled immortals feast, celestial music swells,\nTwin lads lead you in as an Ascending Transcendent’s guest.\nI transmit this to you because your Dao-heart does not retreat,\nWe swear an oath, our words sealed with blood’s heat.\nDo not speak of it carelessly to others you meet,\nNor reveal it needlessly to friends you greet.\nDo not blame me for repeating these words so oft,\nFor carelessness will bring the Underworld’s rebuke aloft.\nHolding hands, we part—what more can I say?\nToday, I sing for you this song anew.\nThough I’ve expounded a thousand wondrous principles profound,\nWho knows if your heart truly believes them sound?\"*\n\nAfter midnight, I have clearly told you all—cherish these words well, and you shall ascend to the Great Luo Heaven.\n\nAs Zhongli’s transmission neared its end, two immortals suddenly appeared, their robes shimmering with rosy clouds, bearing in hand a golden tablet and sacred talisman. They announced: \"By the Emperor’s decree, Zhongli Quan is appointed the Celestial Jade Palace’s Immortal-Selecting Envoy.\" Turning to Dongbin, he said: \"I now ascend to heaven. You must remain in the world, cultivating merit and virtue—one day, you too shall be as I am.\" Dongbin bowed twice and replied: \"My aspirations differ from yours, Master. I must first deliver all beings in the world before ascending—it will not be too late then.\"\n\nThen, phoenixes soared and auspicious cranes took flight, golden banners and jade scepters gleamed, celestial music swelled at dawn, and Master Zhongli, with the two decree-bearing immortals, rose slowly upon the clouds and departed. Having already received the Dao from Master Yunfang, Dongbin was further granted the Heaven-Escape Sword Method by the True Man of Fire Dragon. With it, he severed affliction, desire, and greed and wrath. He once wrote a poem:\n\n*In years past, I met the Fire Dragon Lord,*\n*A sword was passed to me, my constant guard.*\n*Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers—all may dissolve,*\n*Stars and sun and moon—let their wheels halt and resolve.*\n*Know this: the original nature endures through kalpas untold,*\n*Yet in vain do men seek it through springs ten thousandfold.*\n*Last night, Zhongli spoke but one word—*\n*The six heavens’ palaces would crumble to dust, I heard.*\n\nDongbin first roamed the Jiang-Huai region, testing his divine sword to slay a monstrous flood dragon. His appearances and transformations were myriad, and to this day, over four hundred years have passed. Since pledging his great vow to Yunfang, he has drifted through the turbid world, practicing transformation and delivering beings. Though Dongbin remains in the world, he has already transcended its bounds.\n\nDongbin said: \"If people strive to see me, yet upon seeing me fail to follow my words, what benefit is there in being with me day and night? If one can be loyal to their country, filial and kind to their family, trustworthy to friends, benevolent to those below, never slight their own heart, nor deceive in secret—using skillful means to aid others, and with hidden virtue moving heaven and earth—then gods and humans will love them, and ghosts and spirits will revere them. In this single thought, they are already one with me. Though they may not see me, they have seen me indeed.\n\nFor the nature of humanity is this: when the mind turns toward goodness, it belongs to yang, its nature brightens and ascends into lightness and purity—this is the path to heaven. When the mind turns toward evil, it belongs to yin, its nature darkens and sinks into coarseness and weight—this is the stairway to hell. Heaven and hell are not ruled by any lord; they are but the self-made transformations of the human heart.\"\n\nIn the early Jianlong reign of Emperor Taizu of Song, Dongbin emerged from the rear palace gardens and addressed the emperor as \"Zhuling, the Supreme Thearch,\" declaring that by the virtue of fire, he would rule the world. He spoke for some time, his words profound and not to be transmitted. The emperor removed his cinnabar robe and jade belt to bestow upon him, but in an instant, Dongbin vanished. The emperor ordered his portrait painted on the Taiqing Tower, and Daoist registrar Chen Jingyuan disseminated his likeness to the world.\n\nDuring the Zhenghe era, a malevolent spirit haunted the palace, appearing even in broad daylight to steal gold and treasures and violate the imperial consorts—only the emperor’s chambers remained untouched. Though Lin Lingsu, Wang Wenqing, and other court Daoists attempted to exorcise it, the disturbance would cease only to return. The emperor fasted and prayed devoutly, submitting six memorials. One day, as he napped, he saw a Daoist outside the Eastern Flower Gate, wearing a kingfisher-blue lotus crown and a purple crane-feather cloak, holding a crystal ruyi. The Daoist bowed before him and said: \"I come by the Emperor’s command to subdue this evil.\" After a while, a golden-armored figure, ten feet tall, seized the spirit and devoured it nearly whole. The emperor asked who this mighty warrior was, and the Daoist replied: \"This is Lord Guan Yu, the Venerable Casket True Lord, whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed.\" The emperor repeatedly expressed his gratitude, then asked where Zhang Fei was. Guan Yu said: \"Fei is my brother through countless kalpas. Now, he has been reborn in the Yue family of Xiangzhou and will one day assist in the restoration of the dynasty—his merit will be great.\" The emperor asked the Daoist’s name. He replied: \"I am surnamed Yang, born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month.\"\n\nThe emperor awoke and recorded the dream, then summoned his attendants to recount it, suspecting the Daoist to be Lü Dongbin. From that time on, the palace was at peace. He then issued an edict to all regions where Lü Dongbin was venerated with incense and fire, bestowing upon him the title \"Perfected Master of Wondrous Communication.\" This was the beginning. The edict read:\n\n\"We revere the great Dao that unites ruler and people. All hidden immortals are recorded in the celestial registers, yet some silently respond to prayers—such virtue deserves honor. The Perfected Lü concealed his radiance and concealed his name, wandering near and far. When We established the Palace of Blessings, he happened to lodge there. Admiring this divine resonance, We confer upon him a title. Though his spirit is solemn and distant, may it deign to witness this grace. Let him be enfeoffed as Perfected Master of Wondrous Communication. His statue shall be sculpted in the Palace of Radiant Spirits, where seasonal sacrifices shall be offered.\"\n\n**The Ten Trials of Lü Dongbin by Cloud Chamber**\n\n**First Trial:** Lü Dongbin returned from afar to find all his family stricken with illness and dead. His heart remained untroubled; he prepared funeral arrangements, and soon the dead revived, unharmed.\n\n**Second Trial:** Lü sold goods at the market, setting their price with integrity. Buyers suddenly offered only half the agreed sum. He did not argue but relinquished the goods, taking neither the full nor half payment.\n\n**Third Trial:** On New Year’s Day, Lü encountered a beggar at his door seeking alms. He gave money and goods, but the beggar demanded more, hurling insults and brandishing a blade. Lü bowed repeatedly in apology, bared his chest to the knife, and the beggar departed laughing.\n\n**Fourth Trial:** While herding sheep in the mountains, Lü was pursued by a tiger. He pushed a sheep down a steep slope and stood alone before the beast, which then departed.\n\n**Fifth Trial:** Lü read in a mountain hut when a maiden of seventeen or eighteen appeared—her beauty unmatched, her radiance dazzling. She claimed to be returning to her mother’s home but had lost her way. As dusk fell, she pleaded exhaustion and sought rest. Her coquettish manner and countless advances persisted for three days, yet Lü remained unmoved. She then departed.\n\n**Sixth Trial:** Lü returned from the outskirts to find his home plundered by bandits, leaving him with nothing for daily sustenance. Unperturbed, he tilled the land to support himself. While plowing, he unearthed dozens of gold ingots but swiftly buried them, taking nothing.\n\n**Seventh Trial:** Lü purchased copper vessels at the market, only to find them turned to gold upon returning home. He sought the seller and returned them.\n\n**Eighth Trial:** A mad Daoist sold medicine in the streets, claiming it would kill anyone who consumed it. After ten days, none had bought it. Lü, sensing deeper intent, purchased the medicine. The Daoist warned, \"Prepare your final affairs; I must depart.\" Yet Lü suffered no ill effects.\n\n**Ninth Trial:** During spring floods, others struggled to cross, but Lü poled a small boat into the raging currents. Waves tossed the vessel, yet he sat unmoved, resigned to life or death—unharmed in the end.\n\n**Tenth Trial:** Lü sat alone when countless grotesque spirits and demons appeared, some striking, others threatening death. He paid them no mind. Then, dozens of yakshas dragged forth a bloodied, shackled prisoner, who wailed, \"You killed me in a past life—now repay my life!\" Lü replied, \"A life for a life is just,\" and seized a blade and rope to end himself. Suddenly, a voice thundered from the sky, and the spirits vanished. Cloud Chamber descended, clapping and laughing.\n\n---\n\n**Lü Dongbin’s Ten Questions to Cloud Chamber**\n\n**First Question: Heaven and Earth**\nCloud Chamber answered: \"Heaven seeks thrice, and in union with Earth, generates the Three Yang. Earth seeks thrice, and in union with Heaven, generates the Three Yin. Within Yang lies Yin—this is True Yin. When True Yin reaches Heaven, it arises through Yang. Within Yin lies Yang—this is True Yang. When True Yang reaches Earth, it emerges through Yin. Their union attains the Dao, naturally enduring.\"\n\n**Second Question: Sun and Moon**\n\"The moon receives the sun’s essence, transforming Yang into Yin. When Yin reaches its extreme, Yang becomes pure, and the moon’s radiance shines clear. Cultivating to this point, accumulated qi becomes spirit.\"\n\n**Third Question: The Four Seasons and Five Phases**\n\"Within one heart lie the Five Phases; within one day lie the Four Seasons. Fundamentally, Yin and Yang alternate. Yang cannot exist without Yin, yet ultimately, no Yin means no death. Yin cannot exist without Yang, yet ultimately, Yin’s exhaustion yields all Yang.\"\n\n**Fourth Question: Water, Fire, Dragon, and Tiger**\n\"Within the body are sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire. True fire emerges from water—elusive and indistinct, a thing unseen and ungraspable. True water arises from fire—profound and obscure, its essence visible yet ungraspable. This is kidney water. Within water lies qi, called True Fire—heart fire. Within fire arises fluid, called True Water. Water generates wood: when kidney qi is sufficient, liver qi arises, cutting off the kidney’s residual Yin, and as qi passes through the liver, it becomes pure Yang. Concealing the water of True Unity, in its elusiveness, is called the True Dragon. Fire overcomes metal: when heart fluid is abundant, lung fluid arises, cutting off the heart’s residual Yang, and as fluid reaches the lungs, it becomes pure Yin. Concealing the qi of True Yang, in its profundity, is called the True Tiger. Extracting water from qi and qi from water, obtaining a grain of millet, returning it to the Yellow Court—this is the Great Elixir.\"\n\n**Fifth Inquiry on Lead and Mercury:**\nLead is heavy by nature and inclined to sink—this is kidney water, which moistens downward and readily leaks. Mercury is light by nature and inclined to rise—this is heart fire, which flames upward and readily scatters. Using lead to restrain mercury, employing heaviness to anchor light flight, the inner elixir coalesces.\n\n**Sixth Inquiry on Withdrawal and Augmentation:**\nAfter the winter solstice, Yang ascends from the earth, and the earth withdraws its Yin. Greater Yin withdraws to become Reverting Yin; Lesser Yang augments to become Yang Brightness. Reverting Yin withdraws to become Lesser Yin; Yang Brightness augments to become Greater Yang. After the summer solstice, Yin descends from heaven, and heaven withdraws its Yang. Greater Yang withdraws to become Yang Brightness; Lesser Yin augments to become Reverting Yin. Yang Brightness withdraws to become Lesser Yang; Reverting Yin augments to become Greater Yin.\n\nIt is also like the sun and moon: the moon receives the sun’s *hun*-soul, and the sun receives the moon’s *po*-spirit. In the first fifteen days, the moon withdraws its *po*-spirit while the sun augments its *hun*-soul. Its essence and brilliance become full, illuminating the earth below. Otherwise, there would be no initial waxing to become the first quarter, nor the first quarter to become the full moon. The moon restores its Yin *po*; the sun gathers its Yang essence. In the latter fifteen days, the sun withdraws its *hun*-soul while the moon augments its *po*-spirit. Its light fades, and its Yin *po* stabilizes. Otherwise, there would be no full moon waning to the last quarter, nor the last quarter to become the dark of the moon. The sun and moon alternate in cycles of nine and six—this is the image of withdrawal and augmentation.\n\n**Seventh Inquiry on the River Chariot:**\nIn the human body, Yang is scant and Yin abundant, all being nothing but water. Thus, the meaning of the River Chariot is drawn from this. The River Chariot arises within the true water of the north, unlike the forced circulation of heterodox methods.\n\n**Eighth Inquiry on the Wonders of Inner Contemplation and Sitting in Forgetfulness:**\nWhen Dragon and Tiger unite in intercourse, Yin and Yang pair as mates. The Nine August True Persons guide a vermilion-robed youth to descend; the Nine August True Mothers guide a black-robed maiden to ascend. They meet before the Yellow Chamber. A yellow-robed crone receives them, like husband and wife in union, their joy complete. The maiden then descends again, and the youth ascends once more, like husband and wife parting.\n\nHaving completed this, they produce an object the size of a pellet, its color like that of a red tangerine. It is cast into the Yellow Chamber and preserved within the abundance of golden qi.\n\n**Ninth Inquiry on Whether Such Cultivation Invites Demonic Obstructions:**\nDo you know of the ten demonic trials and nine ordeals?\nThe first ordeal is the pressing need for clothing and food.\nThe second is the entanglement of affection and love.\nThe third is the snare of fame and profit.\nThe fourth is the sudden onset of disasters and misfortunes.\nThe fifth is the restraint of blind teachers.\nThe sixth is the confusion of divergent doctrines.\nThe seventh is the slackening of will and intent.\nThe eighth is the wasting of years and months.\nThe ninth is the chaos of troubled times.\n\nThe first demon is the Six Thieves.\nThe second is the demon of wealth and nobility.\nThe third is the demon of the Six Passions.\nThe fourth is the demon of affection and love.\nThe fifth is the demon of suffering and hardship.\nThe sixth is the demon where gods and buddhas become harmful—this is the demon of sages and worthies.\nThe seventh is the demon of blades and warfare.\nThe eighth is the demon of female musicians.\nThe ninth is the demon of feminine allure.\nThe tenth is the demon of goods and profit.\n\n**Tenth Inquiry on What Signs of Verification Exist:**\nIt is said: At first, lewd and deviant impulses are entirely extinguished, and external conduct is cultivated in tandem. During the gathering of the medicine, the golden essence fills to abundance, and the Yin corporeal soul dissolves and melts away.\nNext, the Heart Sutra wells up, and sweet liquid flows from the mouth.\nNext, Yin and Yang strike and clash, and the belly rumbles like thunder.\n\nNext, the hun and po souls remain unsettled, and dreams are filled with startling terrors.\nNext, one may contract minor illnesses that heal without treatment.\nNext, the cinnabar field grows warm at night, and the complexion becomes utterly clear.\nNext, though seated in a dark chamber, the spirit-light manifests of itself.\nNext, as if embracing an infant, one ascends to the Golden Gate.\nNext, with a thunderous roar, the joints open, and startled sweat flows in all directions.\nNext, the jade liquid is refined into congealed butter, and snowflakes scatter down, or blood transforms into milk while the stench of raw flesh gradually becomes unbearable, or the dust-laden bones grow light and slowly turn to gold and jade.\nNext, movement is swift as a galloping horse.\nNext, one remains unmoved by external scenes.\nNext, breath can cure illnesses.\nNext, inner vision grows bright and clear.\nNext, both eyes gleam like lacquer.\nNext, hair regrows where plucked.\nNext, true qi is abundant and one is often sated.\nNext, little food is consumed, yet wine flows without limit.\nNext, the spirit-body shines with luster, and essence-qi radiates elegance.\nNext, the mouth produces strange flavors, and the nose detects rare fragrances.\nNext, the gaze reaches a thousand miles.\nNext, scars and blemishes vanish.\nNext, tears, mucus, saliva, and sweat all cease.\nNext, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms are entirely eradicated.\nNext, the inner will grows pure and lofty, merging with the Great Void; worldly passions fade away, and both heart and realm become empty.\nNext, the hun and po souls no longer wander, and dreams naturally cease; the spirit shines with crystalline clarity, undimmed by day or night.\nNext, yang essence forms the body, and the numinous palace stands firm—neither cold nor heat assails it, and neither life nor death touches it.\nNext, a sigh can dry external mercury.\nNext, spirit-light constantly arises whether sitting or lying down.\nNext, in stillness, celestial music is often heard—the purity of bells, chimes, strings, and bamboo—unlike anything heard in the mortal world.\nNext, in inner vision, one may wander through resplendent towers, pavilions, and palaces of Hua Xu, unseen in the ordinary world.\nNext, the foulness of ordinary people becomes apparent.\nNext, the inner gods manifest.\nNext, external gods come to pay homage; with merit complete and conduct perfected, one receives the register and chart, purple mist fills the eyes, and golden light envelops the body. One may see flying fire-dragons or dancing dark cranes, colorful clouds swirling, auspicious vapors flourishing, heavenly flowers raining down, and divine maidens descending—transcending the mundane to enter sagehood, carefree and natural.\nThis is the day when a great man’s merit is accomplished and his name established.\n\n**Personal Record of the Perfected One:**\nI am from Jingchuan. In the late Tang, I sat for the imperial examinations three times without success. I then wandered rivers and lakes, where I met Master Zhongli and received the art of life-extension. Later, I encountered Perfected Lord Ku Zhu, who transmitted the method of sun-moon conjunction. After a long time, I returned to Mount Zhongnan and again met Master Zhongli, from whom I attained the achievement of the Golden Liquid Great Elixir. At fifty, the Dao was finally realized. My height was five feet and two inches; my face was yellowish-white, my nose tall and straight, and I had a black mole on my left eyebrow.\n\nClad in a white silk robe, girded with a black sash, my transformations were unfathomable—now a scholar, now a soldier. The world often spoke of me as one who could slay men with flying swords. Upon hearing this, I would laugh and say: \"Compassion is the mark of the Buddha. Even immortals are no different; how could they take lives? I do possess a sword, but it is unlike theirs. My three swords are these: the first severs greed and wrath, the second severs lust and desire, and the third severs vexation and sorrow.\"\n\nSince attaining the Dao, I have guided only two souls to transcendence: He Xiangu and Guo Shangchong. Their natures were keen and swift, so I taught them the method of Returning to the Root.\n\nI once told the world: \"To revere my true form is one thing, but to walk my path is another. To walk my path and practice my methods is yet another—then, without ever meeting me, you may achieve the Great Dao. Otherwise, what benefit is there in merely keeping company with me?\"\n\nThis record is inscribed at Wangjiang Pavilion in Jiangzhou.\n\n**The Perfected One’s Instruction of Lu Sheng in the Pillow**\n\nIn the seventh year of Kaicheng, there was a Daoist named Master Lü who had attained the arts of immortality. While traveling along the road between Luo and E, he rested at an inn, loosening his sash and sitting with his bag at ease. Soon after, he saw among the travelers a young man named Lu Sheng, styled Ying. Clad in a short hempen robe and riding a black colt, Lu was bound for his fields but likewise stopped at the inn. He sat beside the Daoist, and their conversation and laughter flowed freely.\n\nAfter some time, Lu Sheng glanced at his shabby attire and sighed deeply: \"A man born into this world yet so ill-fated—how can one not call this suffering?\" The Daoist replied: \"Your body bears no affliction or blemish, and your words are pleasant and fitting. Why then do you lament your hardship?\" Lu Sheng said: \"I merely endure this life—what pleasure is there to speak of?\" The Daoist asked: \"If this is not pleasure, then what is?\"\n\nLu Sheng answered: \"A scholar’s life in this world should be one of building merit and establishing fame, of leading armies and entering court, of feasting from tripods and listening to fine music. Only when one’s clan flourishes and one’s household prospers can one speak of true pleasure. I once aspired to learning and mastered many arts, believing that rank and honor would come as easily as plucking them from the ground. Yet now, past my prime, I still toil in the fields—how is this not suffering?\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, his eyes grew heavy with drowsiness. Just then, the innkeeper was steaming millet. The Daoist reached into his bag and produced a pillow, offering it to Lu Sheng: \"Rest your head upon this, and it shall grant you glory as you desire.\" The pillow was made of green porcelain, with openings at both ends.\n\nLu Sheng lowered his head to it and saw the openings gradually grow bright and vast. He entered with his whole body and soon found himself at home.\n\nWithin months, he wed the daughter of the Cui clan of Qinghe, a woman of surpassing beauty whose dowry proved even richer than expected. Lu Sheng rejoiced greatly, and from that day his robes, carriages, and trappings grew ever more splendid. The following year, he passed the imperial examination and was appointed to the Hanlin Academy. By imperial decree, he was soon transferred to serve as magistrate of Weinan, then promoted to censor. Later, he became a recorder of the imperial court, then a drafter of edicts, and after three years was dispatched to govern Tongzhou before being elevated to oversee the Shaanxi region. Fond of meritorious deeds, he personally supervised the excavation of eighty li of riverbed in Shaanxi to restore blocked waterways, bringing great benefit to the people, who carved a stele to commemorate his virtue.\n\nTransferred to Bianzhou, he concurrently served as the imperial inspector of Henan. Soon after, he was summoned to the capital and appointed governor of the capital prefecture. That year, as the Divine Martial Emperor was engaged in campaigns against the northern tribes and expanding the empire’s borders, the Tubo forces under Xicailuo and Zhulong Mangbuzhi overran Guazhou and Shazhou. The regional commander, Wang Junchan, had just been killed, sending shockwaves through Hexi. The emperor, seeking a capable general, appointed Lu Sheng as censor-in-chief and military governor of Hexi. There, he crushed the barbarian hordes, beheading seven thousand, reclaiming nine hundred li of territory, and constructing a great fortress to guard the strategic pass. The borderland people erected a stele on Juyan Mountain in his honor.\n\nUpon his return to court, he was enfeoffed with the highest honors and rewards. Promoted to vice minister of personnel, he later became minister of revenue and concurrently grand censor. His reputation shone brightly, and the people’s hearts turned toward him. This aroused the envy of the prime minister, who slandered him with false accusations, leading to his demotion to prefect of Duanzhou. Three years later, he was recalled to serve as imperial attendant, and before long, he was appointed chancellor. Alongside Xiao Hao, the minister of the imperial court, and Pei Guangting, the vice minister of rites, he held the reins of power for over a decade. His wise counsel and secret directives were sought daily, and his advice—whether in support or remonstrance—earned him the title of worthy minister. Yet his peers, consumed by jealousy, falsely accused him of colluding with border generals in treasonous plots. An imperial edict ordered his arrest, and officers with their retinue stormed his gate to seize him.\n\nTerrified and bewildered, Lu Sheng turned to his wife and children: \"Our family has five hundred *mu* of fertile land in the mountains—enough to ward off cold and hunger. Why did I ever seek office, only to bring this upon myself? Now I long for the coarse cloth of a commoner, to ride a gray horse along the roads of Jun and E, but it is no longer possible.\" He drew his blade to take his own life, but his wife intervened in time to save him. Though his accomplices were all executed, Lu Sheng was spared by the intercession of a eunuch, his sentence reduced to exile in Yanzhou. Years later, the emperor learned of his innocence and recalled him, restoring him as chancellor and enfeoffing him as Duke of Yan. The imperial favor he received was extraordinary.\n\nLu Sheng had five sons: Jian, Fu, Wei, Dao, and Yi, all men of talent. Jian passed the imperial examination and served as vice director of the Bureau of Merit. Fu became a censor, Wei a secretary of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, Dao a magistrate of Wannian County, and Yi, the most virtuous, was appointed to the Imperial Guard at the age of twenty-eight. Their marriages allied them with the most illustrious families of the realm, and they had over ten grandsons. Twice exiled to distant frontiers, twice elevated to the highest offices, Lu Sheng served both at court and in the provinces, soaring through the ranks of the bureaucracy for over fifty years. His glory and splendor were unmatched, though his nature was somewhat extravagant and indulgent. Fond of music and pleasure, he kept the finest singers and beauties in his rear pavilion. The emperor bestowed upon him countless gifts—fertile lands, grand estates, rare treasures, and prized horses.\n\nAs he grew old and infirm, he repeatedly petitioned to retire, but the emperor refused. During his illness, officials lined the roads to inquire after his health, and the finest physicians and rarest medicines were sent without fail. On his deathbed, he submitted a memorial: \"I was but a humble scholar from the eastern mountains, content with my fields and gardens, when by chance I encountered this sagely reign and was counted among the officials. I was showered with undeserved rewards and extraordinary favor. Abroad, I held the banner of command; at court, I ascended to the highest offices.\"\n\nHaving served both at court and in the provinces, I passed the years in long succession. Though I have been unworthy of Heaven’s grace, I have done nothing to advance the sagely transformation. Like one who rides in a carriage meant for the virtuous only to invite bandits, or treads thin ice with mounting dread, I have lived in daily fear—unaware even of old age’s approach. Now past eighty, I have risen to the rank of the Three Dukes. The clepsydra’s flow has ceased, and my sinews and bones are wholly withered. As I linger in this sinking stupor, my allotted time nears its end. Looking back, I have offered no service worthy of such radiant reign, and have only squandered profound favor. Now I take eternal leave of this sagely age, overwhelmed by gratitude and longing. With reverence, I submit this memorial in humble thanks.\n\nThe imperial edict replied: \"With your outstanding virtue, you have served as Our foremost minister. Abroad, you upheld the frontier’s shield; at court, you fostered harmony and prosperity. For two decades of peace, We have relied upon you. Recently, when illness struck, We daily expected your full recovery. Who could have foreseen this deep affliction? Our heart is truly grieved. Today, We dispatch General of the Brave Cavalry Gao Lishi to your residence to inquire after you. Strive to preserve your health, and care for yourself as you would for Us. Still, We hope for no misfortune, and pray for your recovery.\"\n\nThat very night, Master Lu awoke with a start to find himself lying in the same inn’s guest quarters, with Elder Lü seated beside him. The innkeeper’s millet was still steaming, unchanged from before. Startled, he sat up and exclaimed, \"Was it all a dream?\"\n\nElder Lü said to him, \"Such is the nature of human life’s joys.\"\n\nMaster Lu was silent for a long while, then bowed and said, \"The Way of honor and disgrace, the turns of fortune and misfortune, the principles of gain and loss, the truths of life and death—I now understand them all. This is how you have curbed my desires. How could I dare not heed your teaching?\" He kowtowed twice and departed.\n\n*End of Scroll One of The Records of Ancestor Lü*\n*Scroll Two of The Records of Ancestor Lü: Accounts of Deeds*\n*Twenty-Two Accounts of Divine Transformations*\n\n**The Peach of Wuchang**\nDisguised as a Daoist, Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuchang.\n\nThe Festering Sore\nMaster Lü suffered from a festering sore that laid his belly open and raw. Beneath Yellow Crane Mountain, he cried out, \"Rub my belly, rub my belly!\" The stench drove people away—none dared approach. No one understood that \"rub my belly\" was a hidden phrase meaning \"I will deliver you.\"\n\nThe next day, he disguised himself as a merchant and sold large peaches at the foot of the mountain. When people came to buy, he asked their purpose. All said they bought them for their sons and daughters—none mentioned buying for their fathers or mothers. The Perfected One sighed deeply at the world’s shallow ingratitude and cast all the peaches away, hanging them from a cliff where they rotted into a trace. Today, a Pavilion of the Immortal’s Trace stands at the foot of Yellow Crane Mountain.\n\nSelling Ink in Wuchang\nLü Dongbin traveled to Wuchang, disguised as an ink merchant. Each inkstick was barely over an inch long, yet he priced them at three thousand coins. Days passed without a sale, and the crowd mocked him. A butcher named Wang said, \"The ink is small but the price is high—could there be some deeper meaning?\" He paid three thousand coins for one and shared a boisterous drink with the merchant. Drunk, he returned home and fell into a deep sleep. Around midnight, someone knocked at his door—it was the merchant, returning his money before departing. At dawn, he examined the inkstick and found it transformed into a solid piece of refined gold, bearing the character \"Lü.\" He searched for the merchant, but he had vanished without a trace.\n\nThe Hairpin Feast in Wuchang\n\nAt Heaven’s Heart Bridge in Wuchang, Lü Dongbin wandered in disguise, selling worn wooden combs under an assumed name. He set the price at a thousand coins, yet for months no one bought one. Then an old beggar woman, over eighty years old, hobbled by—her frame bent, her hair white as snow. Dongbin said to her, “People cling to what lies before their eyes and follow the commonplace. I price this shabby thing so high—could there be some deeper meaning? Yet among thousands, none has the insight to see it. How can I speak of the Dao with them?” He took the comb and combed her hair; with each stroke, her hair grew longer, her temples turned black, and her withered face grew young. The crowd, astonished, began clamoring for combs. Dongbin laughed and said, “They see but do not recognize; they recognize but do not see.” He tossed the comb into the river below, where it transformed into a blue-green dragon and soared away. Dongbin and the old woman vanished.\n\nPainting the Mountain at Luofu\nLü Dongbin traveled to Zhu Ming Abbey on Mount Luofu. Arriving at a small hermitage, he found the Daoist master away, with only a young novice present. The boy bowed and said, “Sir, please sit here.” He then stole some of the master’s wine and offered it to Dongbin, who drank his fill and urged the boy to finish the rest. The boy refused, for he had long suffered from a cataract in his left eye. Dongbin dabbed the leftover wine on the boy’s eye, and suddenly it cleared, as if he had never been afflicted. Dongbin then took up a brush and painted a mountain on the wall, with three ponds at its base. He told the boy, “If you had drunk my wine, you would have attained immortality. Since you did not, your fate is sealed—but you will still live ten thousand years.” With that, he flew into the stone wall and disappeared. When the Daoist master returned and saw the painted mountain, which now spanned both sides of the wall, he exclaimed in shock, “The three ponds below form the character *cha*—was this not Master Lü?” Later, the boy indeed lived to one hundred and fifty before passing away.\n\nTempering the Sword at Mount Lu\nLü Dongbin visited Zhenji Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. By the steps, he tempered his sword. The Daoist Hou Yonghui asked, “What is the purpose of your sword?” Dongbin replied, “To rid the world of all injustice.” Hou, struck by his words, invited him to drink wine and eat fruit, saying, “Your demeanor is lofty and pure—you cannot be an ordinary man of this world.” Dongbin replied, “Let us drink heartily; do not press me with questions.” Once drunk, he wrote a poem on the wall with a chopstick:\n\n*Dare I shrink from toil to hone this blade?*\n*At dawn, the jade dragon roars when the case is opened.*\n*In my hand, qi coils like three feet of ice;*\n*The spirit of the stone king is a single serpent.*\n*Treacherous blood silently flows away with the water;*\n*Villains now vanish with the fading stains.*\n*To cut down the world’s injustices,*\n*I shall ascend with you to the nine heavens.*\n\nWhen he finished, the words seemed invisible at first, but the ink’s edges gleamed brightly, shining through to the other side of the wall. Hou, astonished, bowed deeply and asked about the poem. Dongbin said, “There are Daoist swords and there are ritual swords. The Daoist sword moves in and out of formless realms; the ritual sword defends those who govern. This is what common eyes see—it merely dispels demons and banishes evil spirits.” Hou asked, “If you used the Daoist sword to slay villains in a crowded place, would it not shock the world?” Dongbin replied, “Man’s spirit is the mother, and qi is the child. When the spirit remains, qi gathers; when the spirit departs, qi scatters. If you strike the spirit, the qi will leave, and the person will vanish of their own accord. Even if they borrow another’s form, it is all the same.” Hou sighed and said, “These are truly the words of an immortal. May I know your name?” Dongbin said, “I am Lü Cha.” With that, he threw his sword into the air and followed it into the sky.\n\nScattering Coins in Guangling\nLü Dongbin once wandered the markets of Guangling, scattering ten thousand coins in the streets. By evening, he checked and found that all ten thousand had been picked up, save for three. One had fallen into the mud, another into the grass, and the last into a crevice between bricks in a well, about three inches from the opening. Later, two men came to draw water, saw the coin, and fought over it. Dongbin sighed at how deeply the pursuit of wealth consumed people’s hearts.\n\nTurning Earth into Incense\nDuring the Song dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Tianjue received a Daoist in tattered robes who came daily to beg for alms. The minister, failing to show proper respect, jokingly asked what immortal arts the Daoist possessed. The Daoist replied that he could turn earth into incense, and Zhang asked for a demonstration. In an instant, the incense smoke faded, and the Daoist vanished, leaving only a poem on the table:\n\n*Turning earth to incense has its reasons,*\n*In this world, the false is fitting, the true is not.*\n*Prime Minister Zhang Tianjue of the imperial court,*\n*And Lü Dongbin, the cloud-roaming immortal.*\n\nWater Transformed into Wine\nMa Shan was a man from the Eastern Capital...\n\nIn the early Xining reign, Ma Shan failed the imperial examinations and turned to Daoist cultivation. One day, he walked along the Bian River with a Daoist named Hou when they encountered a feathered immortal—clad in a blue headscarf and plain robe, his form refined, his bones extraordinary, his eyes bright as limpid water, his face free of dust. Ma invited him to drink tea and share a meal. Hou, ever cautious, scoffed at the stranger, who replied, \"I possess the art of immortality.\" Hou asked what method he used, and the immortal inquired in return, \"What arts do *you* practice?\" Hou answered, \"I command flying talismans to summon ghosts, transmute stone into gold, and return coins to their original form as jade.\" The immortal said, \"Such arts are not the true Way.\" Hou asked, \"Then what can *you* do?\" The immortal replied, \"I can strengthen my *qi* and purify my spirit.\" Hou pressed, \"What does that mean?\" The immortal said, \"Observe.\" He exhaled a breath toward a wineshop tens of yards away, and the candle within was instantly snuffed out. Then he exhaled toward Hou’s face, and a gust like a gale struck him, so fierce he could scarcely endure it. Both men rose and bowed, saying, \"Sir, you are no ordinary man—we beg your instruction.\" The immortal said, \"To cultivate immortality, one must establish merit and conduct: merit through diligent practice, conduct through aiding others and benefiting all things.\" Hou replied, \"I have spent my life healing people with medicine—is that not merit and conduct?\" The immortal said, \"You take lives to save lives, killing one to preserve another. It would be better to cure illness with talismans and water alone.\" As dawn broke, the immortal took his leave, saying, \"I return to the banks of the Xiang River.\" He bade them farewell beneath a willow’s shade, giving Hou a hundred taels of silver to buy wine. Finding none, the immortal produced a bottle, had Hou fetch a flask of Bian River water, and dropped in a pill. Instantly, it turned into fine wine. The three drank deeply, and the immortal left behind a poem:\n\n*Three mouths share one chamber,*\n*By its side, the water runs clear.*\n*Born to wander the world,*\n*Such is my surname and given name.*\n\nAfter parting, the two realized he was Lü Dongbin.\n\n**Ink Transformed into Gold**\nHan Qi, the Duke of Loyalty and Wisdom, only began inviting alchemists in his later years. One day, Lü Dongbin arrived in tattered robes, his face smeared with grime, seeking an audience. Han dismissed him, asking, \"What can you do?\" Dongbin replied, \"I can make ink.\" When told to demonstrate, he dug a pit in the ground. Han grew displeased, but Dongbin kneaded the earth into ink, saying, \"It is done.\" He then departed. Han examined the ink and found it was pure gold, bearing Lü’s name. When broken, the gold revealed Lü’s mark throughout its texture. Han regretted his dismissal endlessly.\n\n**Square Holes in Paper**\nZhao Yingdao, a supervisor at the Court of Imperial Regalia, suffered from malaria so severe he neared death. Weeping, he bid farewell to his family, saying, \"I am lost. I would give away everything in my home, but my white-haired parents have no one to care for them—what is to be done?\" Before he could finish, a Daoist knocked at the door and said, \"Your illness is not difficult to cure.\" He took two sheets of paper, folding each into a square hole roughly two feet wide, and gave them to Zhao, saying, \"Burn one tonight, grind its ashes, mix them with frankincense decoction, and apply it to the afflicted area. Keep the other for future use.\" With that, the Daoist vanished. Only then did Zhao realize the two square holes formed the character *Lü*.\n\n**Square Holes in Stone**\nLou Daoming of Zitong was a wealthy man well-versed in Daoist arts. He kept ten young maidens, replacing any who became pregnant with a new one, ensuring their number never fell below ten. Day and night, he took them in turn without rest, yet his spirit remained clear, his body robust, his complexion as fresh as a peach blossom. He could go days without eating, and at ninety-seven, appeared no older than thirty. Fond of boasting, he would tell guests at his feasts that the Mysterious Woman sent him wine, the Plain Girl brought him fruit, or that Peng Zu and Rong Cheng had bequeathed him their writings, claiming himself a true immortal. One day, Lü Dongbin, disguised as a beggar, arrived at his gate. Lou, failing to recognize him, shouted at him to leave. Dongbin pressed his feet into the stone, leaving two square holes three inches deep. Lou, astonished, invited him in and seated him at his side, saying, \"You are no beggar.\" He ordered his maidens to sing *Songs of Roaming Immortals* and serve wine. Dongbin improvised a *Wang Jiangnan* lyric in response:\n\n*Upon Jade Pool,*\n*Auspicious mists gather ‘round the immortals.*\n*White-clad lads strike phoenix chimes,*\n*Green-robed maidens play simurgh pipes.*\n*I dwell in the Great Brahma Heaven.*\n*Drunk, I wander*\n*The misty peaks of Jade Capital Mountain.*\n*The hymns of void-step singing end,*\n*Yet I know not what year this is—*\n*Seas turn to mulberry fields once more.*\n\nA maid brought Sichuan paper and asked for his calligraphy. Dongbin wrote from the bottom of the page to the top, filling every space without a gap. Lou was overjoyed and sought to learn the essentials of the Dao, but Dongbin said, \"I have already transmitted it to you mouth to mouth.\" When Lou pressed further, he repeated, \"I have already transmitted it to you mouth to mouth.\" Suddenly, he climbed to the top of a large mulberry tree outside the gate and vanished. Days later, Lou fell ill, vomiting silver-like phlegm by the bucketful before dying. The \"mouth-to-mouth transmission\" and the two square holes in the stone were both veiled references to the character *Lü*.\n\n**Immortal Music at the Feast**\nChen Zhizhong built a grand estate in the Eastern Capital. As his family and friends gathered for a feast, a ragged Daoist arrived—Lü Dongbin in disguise. Chen asked, \"What skills do you possess?\" Dongbin replied, \"I have a set of immortal music to grace your splendid banquet.\" From his waist, he produced a scroll and hung it on a pillar. The painting depicted twelve celestial maidens, each holding a musical instrument. Dongbin called them down, and they descended like a string of pearls, lining up before him. Two maidens bearing banners led the way, while the others played their instruments. Their skin was jade-smooth, their faces flower-like, their demeanor dignified, their voices sweet. They wore seven-jeweled crowns, gossamer robes, golden clasps, and jade pendants that chimed as they moved. On each maiden’s nose rested a grain-sized piece of yellow jade, their bodies so light and ethereal they seemed scarcely human.\n\nThe music rang clear through the misty heavens, its melodies unlike any earthly tune. After three movements, Chen asked, \"What manner of women are these?\" The Daoist replied, \"These are the Six Jia and Six Ding Jade Maidens. When one cultivates the Dao to completion, the three hun-souls, seven po-souls, five viscera, and six bowels within the body all transform into such beings. Would you, sir, wish to learn?\"\n\nChen dismissed it as illusion and deception, growing increasingly displeased. The Daoist turned to the maidens and said, \"You may depart.\" They all returned to the painted scroll, which the Daoist then took and swallowed whole. He demanded paper and brush, writing boldly:\n\n*I have passed through three thousand kalpas in the heavens above,*\n*And lived five hundred years among mortals below.*\n*My waist-borne sword flashes with purple lightning,*\n*The elixir furnace’s flames rise in billowing smoke.*\n*Just now I rode a white deer across the azure sea,*\n*Then mounted a blue ox to enter the grotto-heavens.*\n*Such minor arts are but idle play—*\n*None know I am a true immortal.*\n\nAt the end, he signed: *Written by the Valley Guest.* He then strode out the door, vanishing in an instant. Chen realized the Valley Guest was none other than Dongbin. Overcome with remorse, he wished to gouge out his own eyes. Soon after, he passed away, his life adrift like a leaf upon the waves.\n\nThe Green River calligrapher Master Zhai delighted in hosting Daoist adepts. When Dongbin came to visit, Zhai lodged him in his home with the utmost courtesy, and thus they came and went for over a year. One day, Dongbin led Zhai to the banks of the Jiang’s cleansing waters, where he bit a brush shaft in two and set the pieces afloat upon the waves. Stepping onto one half, he beckoned the calligrapher to do the same. Master Zhai, terrified, dared not advance, but Dongbin laughed and crossed to the far shore. In an instant, he vanished, and Zhai then knew him to be no ordinary man.\n\nTen days later, Dongbin returned, bringing food to share with Zhai—all of it rancid and rotten. Zhai pinched his nose and declined to eat, at which Dongbin sighed and said: *\"Since you cannot stomach coarse fare, I leave you two jars of meat sauce.\"* Then he departed and was seen no more. When Zhai opened the jars, he found them filled with gold flakes. Two jars—were they not like two great vats?\n\n**The Fish Revived**\nWhile wandering a wineshop on Mount Lu, Dongbin saw a fish being butchered for stew. *\"I shall make this fish live again,\"* he declared. The cook did not believe him, but Dongbin placed a single pellet of medicine into the fish’s belly. After a long while, the fish leapt and writhed as if alive. Astonished, the cook released it into the river, where it swam away, vigorous and free. Dongbin was nowhere to be found.\n\n**The Jeweled Wheel Appears**\n\nDuring the Shaoxing reign, a county magistrate was fond of Daoist arts. He constructed a grand *Baolu* Abbey, where masters of esoteric techniques gathered to display their skills. Dongbin, concealing his true name, lodged there and boasted of his abilities as surpassing all others. Taking a pinch of medicine, he rubbed it into his palm, blew upon it several times, and soon a crimson glow suffused outward, forming the image of a jeweled wheel upon which appeared the characters \"Dongbin.\" The crowd was astounded, but when they looked again, he had vanished.\n\n**A Boy Transformed into a Crane**\nAt the Zhenxian Hall of Tianqing Abbey in Changzhou stood a statue of Dongbin. A young boy selling indigo would pass by daily, and upon seeing the statue’s dignified bearing, he grew reverent and lingered, unwilling to leave. One day, as he gazed and sighed, the statue suddenly stirred, beckoning him with an outstretched hand. It held a coin to buy indigo, but the boy refused the money, offering instead all the stalks in his basket. The statue’s expression brightened, and it gave the boy a red pellet, instructing him to swallow it. At once, the boy felt dazed, as if drunk. Returning home, he demanded paper and brush to compose essays—his words and calligraphy were exquisite, and he became versed in astronomy, geography, and all manner of knowledge. He abstained from marriage, fire-cooked food, and meat, drinking only wine and eating dates. This continued for over a year.\n\nOne day, hearing of an execution in the marketplace, he rushed to watch. Just as the blade fell, a hand struck the condemned man’s left cheek from midair. A small crane flew from the corner of his mouth, and when the boy touched the man’s cheek, he found it half-withered. The man’s foolishness returned as before.\n\n**The Real Coin in the Boy’s Hand**\nIn Xianju, Taizhou, a man named Wang San encountered a beggar in the market selling a clay figurine of Master Lü. He bought it and enshrined it at home, offering incense with great reverence. His ten-year-old son also paid daily respects. One day, while herding cattle on a hillside, the boy saw a Daoist in white passing by. He leapt from the ox’s back, grasped the Daoist’s robe, and called out, \"Master Lü!\" The Daoist asked, \"How do you know to address me so? And how do you recognize me?\" The boy replied, \"You look just like the statue I worship at home—only taller.\" The Daoist laughed, placed a real coin in the boy’s hand, and warned, \"When you wish to buy something, use this. It will provide endlessly, but you must tell no one.\" Overjoyed, the boy returned home and secretly showed his father. The moment he spent one coin, another appeared in his palm.\n\nFor over a month, this continued, until the father’s greed grew boundless. He set a basket beside the boy and ordered him to keep brushing his hand against it. The coins fell one after another. By the third day, they had amassed over ten thousand. The next day, the coins ceased to appear.\n\nAt the Qingcheng Daoist Assembly, tens of thousands gathered. Villagers near the mountain built huts to offer tea and fruit to the attendees. A pastry shop owner made a vow to the gods for relief. One day, a drunken patron arrived at his home, spewing vulgarities and smearing mud on the left side of the outer gate. The pastry maker found him unbearable—offering money was refused, offering pastries was spurned.\n\nEarlier, the wind had snapped a large tree, which the locals had split into two benches placed by the door for travelers to rest. The shop stood far from the river, and just as the owner had drawn two buckets of water, the drunk suddenly rose, tied straw into a brush, dipped it in the water, and began scrubbing the wood. He scrubbed vigorously for two hours, then stepped back to admire his work. Passersby, seeing it from afar, turned away in disgust, and by day’s end, not a single pastry was sold. The drunk finally left, bidding the owner, \"Do not be angry with me. Tomorrow, I will bring money to repay you—twice what you’re owed.\" As he walked off, he approached one of the benches, intending to sit, but upon seeing its radiant sheen, he took thick ink and boldly wrote: *The Living Master Lü*. He tried to scrape it off with a knife, but the more he scraped, the brighter the characters shone, penetrating deep into the wood as if engraved throughout. A crowd gathered to gawk.\n\nFrom that day on, the shop’s pastries and fruits sold briskly. This occurred in the second month of the thirty-second year of Shaoxing (1162). It was said that Shou Qing personally witnessed the wood-washing and described the Daoist as a gaunt figure.\n\n---\n\nIn the twenty-eighth year of Shaoxing (1158), a merchant from Huating loaded his boat with ten thousand reed mats bound for Lin’an. The vessel was packed to the brim. As he departed the western gate at dusk, a Daoist on the shore called out, asking for passage. The merchant replied, \"The boat is full—there’s not even room to stand outside. How could I accommodate you?\" The Daoist said, \"I’ll give you a thousand coins for just a mat’s worth of space.\" The merchant asked, \"What if it rains?\" The Daoist replied, \"I’ll give you another hundred coins to buy a mat for cover.\" Tempted by the money, the merchant allowed him aboard. The Daoist sat on a mat, barely enough to kneel on. He neither ate nor drank nor relieved himself, and no rain fell during the journey.\n\nUpon reaching the northern gate, he bid farewell, saying, \"Thank you for carrying me. I will repay you with twenty thousand coins.\" The merchant was baffled. That year, the imperial suburban sacrifice required vast quantities of reed mats. The Lin’an prefecture, fearing a shortage, raised the price by two coins per mat for all incoming shipments and bought them all. The merchant profited twenty thousand coins. After unloading, the bottommost mat bore six bold ink characters: *Lü Dongbin once rode this boat*. The calligraphy was vigorous, and those who saw it knew it was the hand of an immortal. The next day, the merchant entered the city and passed the Zhongan Bridge, where he encountered the same Daoist selling ginger in the market. He bowed and said, \"So you are Master Lü! I thought you could transform gold—give me some.\" The Daoist laughed and replied, \"Watch my ginger for me. I’ll return to my lodging to fetch the gold—guard it well.\" By nightfall, he had not returned. The merchant had the ginger delivered home by a servant, no longer resentful. Those who heard the tale found it absurd.\n\n---\n\nIn Yuan’an County of Xiazhou, the people revered immortals and Buddhas. They once held a feast in honor of Master Lü Chunyang, drawing a great gathering of Daoists. After the meal, an old soldier arrived from outside, clad in a green robe and hemp sandals, carrying two baskets slung from a pole. He squatted down, shouting for food, and refused to leave. The host, having leftover porridge, gave it to him, and he also demanded wine. With a small flask, he drained it in one gulp, repeating this several times. The host, astonished by his capacity, asked, \"Can you drink more?\" The soldier replied, \"I’d gladly do so, but your family is noble—I dare not impose.\" When more wine was brought, he downed it all without leaving a drop.\n\nHe then asked what the feast was for, and the host explained. The soldier said, \"If Master Lü himself appeared, would you recognize him?\" The host pointed to a painted portrait on the wall. The soldier laughed and said, \"My appearance and attire are nothing like that. Give me five feet of silk, and I’ll paint you a true likeness.\" Delighted, the host fetched the silk and handed it to him. Without applying ink or powder, the soldier merely rubbed the silk between his hands, then suddenly retched violently, wiping the silk with his vomit. The host was disgusted, assuming he was drunk, and the onlookers cursed and urged him to leave. After a while, the soldier tucked the silk into an empty space, bowed, and departed.\n\nA servant boy retrieved the silk and unfurled it—an immortal’s portrait had appeared. The figure’s tattered robes and sandals matched the soldier’s own. Realizing the immortal had descended, the host was filled with regret for his rudeness and framed the portrait for worship. This occurred in the seventh year of Chunxi (1180), and the story was recorded by Zhou Jianshan, a registrar from Xinchang.\n\n---\n\nAt the Du Family Garden Gathering...\n\nIn the sixteenth year of Shaoxing (1146), Wang Yinzu served as an officer in the Hubei Judicial Commission and lodged at the inn of Zhang Siguanren. Du Changyan of Wuling had a small garden where various flowers were in full bloom, and on the sixth day of the third month, he invited Wang, Zhang, and two or three other guests to gather for drinks. Midway through the feast, each guest plucked three blossoms from the tea bushes and tucked them into their headbands. Suddenly, a Daoist in a blue robe and Daoist attire, wearing a straw raincoat and bamboo hat, emerged with objects in his sleeves. He bowed to the company and said, “Gentlemen, your esteemed gathering—might I join your feast?” Du invited him to sit, poured a large cup of wine, and the Daoist drained it in one gulp. He devoured the meat with great relish, leaving not a morsel behind, then set down his chopsticks with a faint smile, his spirit radiant. “Allow me to offer a toast to honor all of you,” he said. Du asked him to wait a moment, but the Daoist replied, “I too have wine here—let me repay your kindness.” He then presented a cup and insisted they drink their fill. The guests dared not refuse, but he addressed Wang alone: “Your bearing is noble, and you possess the disposition for cultivating the Dao. The only pity is that worldly affairs still cling to you. For now, drink my wine.” Reaching into his sleeve, he drew out a tin flask, holding about two *sheng*, and poured for each guest. Though the wine had never been warmed, it was piping hot, its flavor pure and rich. Du marveled at this and saw that the flask still held about a cup’s worth. The Daoist asked, “Could you drink another cup?” Du replied, “Indeed, I would like to.” After he finished, Du jested, “How much wine does this flask hold that it never runs dry? Are you perhaps Master Dongbin?” The Daoist replied, “You have never met Elder Lü—why do you speak of him?” Then he laughed and said, “Would you gentlemen like to see him?” With that, he removed the bamboo hat from his back and tossed it into the air. His body rose over a *zhang* high, straddled a white crane, and vanished—along with the flask.\n\n**Coins Pressed into Stone**\nDuring the Jingtai era of the Song, a man named Yin who ran an incense and paper shop in Shaowu Military Prefecture regularly provided for wandering Daoists, always offering three coins without fail. One day, a Daoist arrived holding a millet-stalk fan and begged for money. Coincidentally, Yin was preoccupied with other matters and, in irritation, tossed three coins onto the fan—only for them to fall to the ground. The Daoist pressed them into the earth with his foot and left without a glance. Yin retrieved the coins, only to find them firmly embedded in the brick, immovable. Onlookers were astonished, but the Daoist had already disappeared. When Yin pried the brick loose with a hoe, he found a poem inscribed on its reverse:\n\n*For a lifetime, my great vow was to ferry three thousand souls,*\n*Yet to this day, it remains unfulfilled.*\n*I came here with purpose—*\n*Alas, the Yin family’s bones are not destined for immortality.*\n\nThis inscribed brick is now set into the wall of the City God Temple.\n\n**Manifestations of the Way – Sixteen Accounts**\nBy Lü Yuangui\n\nLü Dongbin traveled to Jiangxia, disguising himself as Lü Yuangui. He frequented the home of a local resident, the Yang family, where he foretold fortunes and misfortunes with great accuracy. One day, he suddenly took his leave, saying, \"A wicked man is coming—I must avoid him.\" That very evening, Yu Lu, the Judicial Commissioner, arrived in Ezhou on an inspection tour. He immediately sought out Lü, but the latter had vanished. Instead, he found Lü’s usual associate, Cen Wenxiu. Yu demanded to know where Cen had hidden Lü, but Cen insisted he knew nothing. Yu grew furious, threatening to flog him, yet Cen’s answers remained unchanged. Yu then ordered a search of Cen’s home, where they discovered a long poem Lü had left behind, expounding on the practice of internal alchemy. Yu pondered the poem and realized: \"This is Master Lü. *Yuangui* is but a split of the characters in his name. As for the 'wicked man,' he must have meant me, for I pursued him relentlessly.\"\n\n**The Recluse of Qian and Kan**\nJinling’s Wan Tie, known as the Old Man of Iron and Stone, was of pure disposition and deeply drawn to the Dao. He sustained himself through planchette writing, and whenever he invoked the spirits, Lüzu would appear. One day, Lüzu appeared in his dream to explain the eight trigrams. Another dream foretold that on a certain day, a guest would arrive bearing a handwritten text he could request. When the appointed day came, the guest indeed appeared, and Wan obtained the text, which he used for divination for over a decade.\n\nIn the *gengwu* year of the Longqing era, Wan contracted a debilitating illness, his left arm bound in silk, forcing him to walk with a staff. On the twenty-first day of the eleventh month, he was carried in a sedan past Pude Temple. Alighting, he saw a Daoist who called out, \"Old Iron!\" Wan replied, \"Alas, I suffer from hemiplegia and am reduced to this.\" The Daoist rebuked him sharply: \"What do you mean by 'hemiplegia'? A half-withered tree may still bear both flourishing and withered branches, but it is inevitably consumed by fire. How can a man be the same?\" He then asked when the illness had begun. Wan answered, \"On the twenty-first day of the seventh month.\" The Daoist said, \"This is the sign of dense clouds without rain.\"\n\nWan asked, \"Is there a good medicine for it?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Is there a good moxibustion treatment?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then how shall I pass my days?\"\n\"By begging in the marketplace.\"\nWan noticed the gourd he carried and asked, \"Do you beg with that?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWan inquired after the Daoist’s surname, and he replied, \"Qian.\" Asked for his style, he said, \"Sicun.\" Wan pressed further: \"What does *cun* mean? What are you contemplating?\" The Daoist answered, \"*Cun* signifies difficulty in the *Yijing*. *Sicun* means I constantly reflect on hardship. I followed my master at six and have never known lust, though I still indulge in wine and wealth—yet I manage myself, unlike you, who brought this misfortune upon yourself.\" After a long silence, he expounded on the meaning of *cun* and said, \"Your illness stems from liver *qi*—this is *cun*.\" Then he called out, \"Old man, walk to the bridge.\" Wan, without realizing it, leaned on his staff and walked to the east gate of the temple. The Daoist called again, \"Old man, go a little farther.\" Wan declined, saying he could not.\n\nThe Daoist, as if gently pulling him by the hand, led him from the bridge to a rocky outcrop between two flowering trees, where he leaned against a tree and sat. Placing his hand on Wan’s waist and kidneys, he asked, “Does this feel sore?” Wan replied, “No.” The Daoist then pressed down to his knees and said, “Now it does.” Noticing a strip of cloth hanging from Wan’s hand, he reached into his robe and palpated up and down three times, remarking, “Fortunately, you are thin—you can be cured.” He added, “All five of your viscera are aflame. No medicine is needed, only Wuyi tea will suffice. The southeast-facing shoots are best. Steep them in mountain spring water—when the leaves stand upright, the infusion is ready; if you add well water, they will lie flat.”\n\nMoved by his kindness, Wan asked where he resided. The Daoist replied, “Qingyuan Abbey. Ask for the Daoist Sicun, surnamed Qian.” With that, he took his leave. Wan returned home, and his illness vanished at once—his gait restored to its former ease. When Mao Chou later marveled at the change, Wan explained, “I met an immortal. *Si* means ‘silk,’ *cun* means ‘pure,’ and *Qian* is yang—this was none other than the Patriarch Lü.” He then went to Qingyuan Abbey to seek him out, but only a painted statue remained. The abbey’s Daoist confirmed his departure.\n\nTeng Zongliang, styled Zijun, was demoted to serve as magistrate of Baling. Dongbin, disguised as the Daoist Hui, sought an audience with him. His bearing was lofty and refined, his discourse brilliant and eloquent. Zijun found him extraordinary and composed a poem on the spot to present to him:\n\n*“A Daoist Hui from Huazhou,*\n*Has come to the city of Yiyang.*\n*Where will you wander when you leave me?*\n*A sword lies across the autumn sky.”*\n\nDongbin laughed heartily, then vanished in an instant. Zijun ordered a portrait of him to be painted and placed in Yueyang Tower.\n\nThe Daoist Hui\nAt Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, over ten Daoists gathered in the storehouse hall. A visitor calling himself the Daoist Hui strode in with arms swinging, casting haughty glances at all present. The assembly muttered among themselves: *“Impostors abound, stealing this name to parade themselves—how vulgar! What use have we for such?”* They turned away without a glance, save for Hu Yongzong, who bowed and invited him in. They sat in a small pavilion, conversing with ease and grace. Struck by his bearing, Hu treated him with heightened respect. Soon, the Daoist asked for wine. Glancing about, he found a knife, scraped earth, and strained wine through it, mixing the dregs in his palm. Blowing on the paste, he shaped it into an inkstick and tossed it onto the table with a resonant *clink*. He told Hu: *“Keep this well—it too can cure illness.”* When Hu examined it, a rich fragrance filled the air, far surpassing orchid or musk. The Daoist then invited Hu to ascend a tower for wine, but Hu declined, citing the late hour. He departed with a laugh.\n\nThe next day, Hu hurried to the prefecture. Before dawn, he reached the city gate and encountered the Daoist emerging from within, laughing as he turned to look back. A clerk mentioned that the Daoist Hui had been waiting at the gate since midnight. Hu marveled even more. Upon returning home, he tested the knife—half had turned golden. After taking a small dose of the gifted ink, years later his appearance showed no sign of aging, and his capacity for wine grew daily.\n\nLater, the Daoist returned, clad in tattered robes and a worn hat, straw sandals and a hempen belt, carrying two gourds on a pole. He asked Hu what was inside. When Hu poured them out, they were revealed to be silver ingots. Only then did he realize this was the true Patriarch Lü. He bowed in reverence as a disciple and earnestly sought the art of longevity. There is a line that goes: *“At Nanjin Port once more, I meet Patriarch Lü’s boat.”* His grandson later displayed a portrait of the Yellow-Robed Elder painted by his ancestor—its purity and severity were beyond the common world.\n\nThe Daoist Hui\nDongbin traveled to Changsha, again disguised as the Daoist Hui.\n\nWith a small clay jar, he begged for coins. Though he kept no tally, the jar never filled. People marveled at this. One day, seated by the roadside, he declared, *“Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall receive the Dao.”* People vied to toss money in, yet the jar remained unfilled. A monk, pushing a cartload of coins in jest, asked, *“Could your jar hold all this?”* The Daoist assented. As the cart was pushed in, a grating sound arose—then all vanished. The monk exclaimed, *“Are you a divine immortal or a master of illusion?”* The Daoist improvised a poem:\n\n*Neither god nor immortal,\nNeither art nor illusion.\nHeaven and earth have their end,\nMulberry fields shift and change.\nThe body was never truly mine,\nNor wealth worth clinging to.\nWhy not follow me,\nRiding the whale through boundless skies?*\n\nThe monk, increasingly bewildered, sought to seize him. The Daoist said, *“If you regret these coins, I shall repay you now.”* He took a slip of paper, cast it into the jar, and invoked, *“Push the cart out swiftly.”* After a long wait, nothing emerged. *“I must retrieve it myself,”* he said, leaping into the jar. Silence fell. The monk shattered the jar, finding only a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:\n\n*To seek the true, first know the true,\nYet seeing it, you fail to grasp.\nWe’ll meet again with a laugh,\nAs I drive my cart down a level road.*\n\nThe monk returned in dismay. Later, on the road to Pinglu, he suddenly saw the Daoist. *“I have awaited you long,”* the Daoist said, returning the cart with all its coins intact. *“I am Patriarch Lü. I once thought you teachable, but your attachment to money proves otherwise.”* The monk, filled with remorse, could only apologize too late.\n\nHe also wandered as a Daoist at Taiping Abbey.\n\n**The Recluse Hui**\nPalace Attendant Jia Shixiong of the Ministry of Works kept an ancient iron mirror and wished to temper and polish it. Lü Dongbin, calling himself the Recluse Hui, visited and requested to test its edge. From his bamboo staff, he took a pinch of powder, sprinkled it on the mirror, and departed, saying, *“I shall return with more.”* When pursued, he had vanished. Only at his lodging in Taiping Temple did they find a poem inscribed on the door:\n\n*In my hand, a green serpent gleams beneath the sun,\nIn the cave, immortal fruits bloom with eternal spring.\nKnow this: the traveler beyond the mist and clouds\nIs no mere mortal polishing mirrors in the dust.*\n\nUpon inspection, the powder on the mirror had vanished, leaving only a spot of luminous jade-like radiance.\n\n**The Mountain Man Hui**\nOn the nineteenth day of the eighth month in the first year of the Xining era, he met Shen Shan of Donglin in Huzhou, who called himself the Mountain Man Hui. Using pomegranate bark, he wrote a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*My western neighbor, though rich, frets over want,\nMy eastern elder, though poor, delights in sufficiency.\nI brew white wine to welcome green-clad guests,\nAnd scatter gold to gather books.*\n\nHe was also called the Old Man Hui, as noted in the later entry on his visit to Shi Guojian.\n\n**Hui the Later Nurturer**\nLü Dongbin traveled to Tianqing Abbey in Qinzhou. At the time, all the Daoist clergy had departed for a neighboring prefecture’s ritual feast, leaving only a young acolyte behind. Dongbin sought a brush to inscribe the wall, but the boy declined, citing the abbey’s recent renovation and the master’s prohibition against defacing the walls. *“Then,”* Dongbin said, *“kindly tend the brazier in the hall of worship; I wish to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.”* After he left, the boy saw the clear, still waters of the pond behind the hall. With a melon, Dongbin traced characters on the wall:\n\n*The stone pond’s limpid water mirrors my heart,\nYet peach blossoms’ shadows plunge it into depth.\nOnce within the palace halls of Bangshan,\nI quiet my thoughts with the seven-stringed zither.*\n\nAt the end, he signed: *Hui the Later Nurturer*. The inscription was so high no hand could have reached it. The assembly marveled, realizing *Hui* was Lü, and *Later Nurturer* was the master’s reversal of his own name.\n\n**The Valley Guest**\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, a Daoist in the Eastern Capital called himself the Valley Guest. He drank with the commoner Teng Zhong, and upon parting, left him a pellet of medicine. Teng, who had long suffered from wind-induced ailments, was cured upon taking it. Two years later, in Yangzhou, Teng encountered the Valley Guest again by the east side of Kaiming Bridge. Seated by the water, the Daoist beckoned him. Teng took the road, crossed the bridge, and hurried over—only to find no trace of him. He then realized it had been Lü Dongbin. Disappointed, he soon passed away.\n\nEarlier, he had swallowed an axle and inscribed a poem; later, in Tanzhou, he lodged at an inn, both times calling himself the Valley Guest.\n\n**The Keeper of the Valley**\nCui Zhongju, having passed the imperial examinations, was traveling through Baling when he stayed at a roadside inn. There, he sang the lyric *“Spring in the Qin Garden.”* Lü Dongbin, who had come to mend sandals in the marketplace, asked about the song. *“What melody is this?”* Cui replied, *“A new tune from the Eastern Capital.”* *“I cannot write,”* Dongbin said, *“inscribe the lyrics for me.”* Cui complied, transcribing the words:\n\n*Sevenfold cyclical elixir,\nA hundredfold myriad transformations...*\n\nWhen Cui asked his name, Dongbin said, *“I was born by the river’s mouth, grew up by the mountain’s mouth—now I am the Keeper of the Valley.”* The next morning, Cui informed the prefect, saying, *“This is Lü Dongbin.”* The prefect hastily ordered his summoning. They knocked at his door, but the response grew fainter with each call. When no answer came, they forced the door open—only to find the room empty. On the wall was a poem:\n\n*The infant in my belly is fully nurtured,\nSo I dwell in the bustling market to amuse myself.\nYet some meddling scholar prattles on,\nAnd I retreat into the depths of white clouds.*\n\nCui and the prefect could only sigh in regret.\n\n**Chang Xuzhong**\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Huizong, a Daoist calling himself Chang Xuzhong frequented the various jade palaces. His movements were strange and unpredictable—he could drink wine without limit, devour raw fish and meat by the dozens of pounds, and down dozens of *hu* of cold water. Once, when snow blanketed the ground seven or eight *chi* deep, he buried himself in it and remained there for ten days without emerging. When the snow cleared, he rose and walked across the surface of deep pools as if treading solid ground. He was also skilled in cursive script, his strokes resembling withered vines or drifting silk, flowing in unbroken strands of thousands at a stroke. People vied to bring him paper, begging for his calligraphy, but he never obliged.\n\nThe character *Chang* in his name, *Xuzhong*, was part of the character *Lü*—for he was none other than Lü the Carefree Elder.\n\nAt Hengpu on Mount Dayu, there lived a wealthy man’s son who, enamored of the Dao, built a hermitage and hosted wandering Daoists for many years. One day, as a grand Yellow Register fasting ritual concluded, a ragged Daoist arrived seeking alms. The crowd, indifferent, even mocked and insulted him. The Daoist inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall:\n\n*Passing through Dayu,\nWho speaks with the white crane that flies here?\nBy the ridge-side homes,\nHow many times have I seen the winter plum bloom?\nSpring comes, spring goes,\nI stand where falling flowers meet flowing waters.\nBlossoms fill the path ahead,\nHiding immortals where none know.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote: *The Carefree Elder comes*—rendering the five characters in three distinct styles. Having finished, he entered the cloud hall and did not reappear. When they went to look, he had vanished; only his calligraphy remained, the ink seeping through to the other side of the wall. Then they realized that *Chang* without its heart was *Lü*—it was Lord Lü! The crowd sighed in remorse.\n\nThe Ailing Carefree One\n\nBy the great river in Jishui County, Jiangxi, stood the Xuantan Abbey. One day, all the Daoists descended the mountain to perform rituals, leaving only a young novice behind. A Daoist in a blue headscarf and white robe arrived, walking unhurriedly, and sought lodging. The novice, citing his master’s absence, refused. The Daoist asked for a brush and inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n*Lifting my robes, I seek a true host,\nThe pure scene of this night leaves me unsatisfied in song.\nThe moon hangs over the cold pool, the wind sighs in the pines—\nWhy need I the thirty-six grotto-heavens?*\n\nSigning it *The Ailing Carefree One*, he tossed the brush aside and departed. The next day, the master returned, and the novice recounted the Daoist’s request and poem. The Daoists went to see the calligraphy—its strokes were ethereal and extraordinary. Peering into the room, they found the ink had bled through the wall. Only then did they realize it was the brush of the Pure Yang Patriarch. In the thirty-ninth year of the Jiajing era, a great flood swept through, collapsing the abbey—but the wall bearing the poem stood firm, its plaster unchipped. Witnesses marveled, and a local magnate forcibly took it. As they carried it away, halfway over a ridge, it tumbled onto the rocks. To this day, traces of plaster and ink remain.\n\nMaster Bin the Dharma Master\n\nAt the Zhangren Abbey on Mount Qingcheng, Huang Ruogu was a man of refined bearing, strict discipline, and spotless conduct. He often healed the sick with celestial incantations, talismanic water, and the Three Luminaries’ Black Rite, achieving remarkable results. Yet whatever wealth he received, he immediately distributed to the poor.\n\nLü Dongbin once disguised himself as Master Bin and paid him a visit, staying for over a month. The talismans he drew would, when blown upon, transform into dragons, serpents, clouds, and mist, flying off to exorcise demons and summon generals, who would manifest in visible form. He could converse with spirits, stamp his foot to summon thunder, blink to flash lightning, exhale to form clouds, and spit to bring rain. He was also skilled in painting without brush or ink—merely holding water in his mouth and spraying it onto paper or silk, where mountains, rivers, flowers, trees, palaces, birds, beasts, and figures would naturally appear, needing only a light touch to refine them. Whenever he sold a painting, he would buy wine and drink heartily with Ruogu. Ruogu, though a heavy drinker, was always bested by Bin.\n\nOne day, Ruogu asked, “Master, your conduct is unlike that of ordinary men—you must have come from among the immortals. Can you speak to me of the Dao?”\n\nBin replied, “The seven stars of the Northern Dipper on your left foot are missing one—how can you achieve the Dao? You have but one lifetime left.”\n\nRuogu was astonished. “Master Bin must be a sage!” For on the sole of his left foot was a birthmark shaped like the Northern Dipper, with one star missing—a fact no one had ever known.\n\nRuogu then asked how long he would live. Dongbin wrote ninety-four characters backward on the wall, enclosing them in two interlocking circles, and took his leave. Only later did Ruogu realize the two circles formed the character *Lü*, while *Bin* was his surname. He died at forty-nine, just as the reversed writing had foretold.\n\nThe Fellow Guest\n\nDuring the Xining era, there was a man in Jiangnan who called himself Master Li, the Fellow Guest.\n\nHe carried a palm-leaf hat, spun a wheel of flutes, tapped short clappers, and sang *The Fisherman’s Pride*, blending it with the resonant beat of a fishing drum. His voice was clear and stirring, as though echoing from the azure heavens. The lyrics went:\n\n*\"In Jiangnan’s second month, the mountain paths by rivers lie,\nLi flowers scatter—spring has lost its guide.\nA single fish finds no place to hide,\nWind and rain forge scales on the jade dragon’s side—\nIt ascends to heaven’s tide.\"*\n\nIf offered money, he would refuse; if offered wine, he would not decline. Later, in the second month of the *jiachen* year, he passed away, leaving no trace of his body behind. Only then did people realize that the Fellow Guest was none other than Lü Dongbin.\n\n**The Yellow-Robed Elder**\n\nZhong Jiang of Changsha, styled Zhongshan, was returning home from Jinling after retiring from office during the Jiading era of the Jiading reign. As his boat docked at the Southern Ford of Baling at dusk, he suddenly saw another vessel pass by. On board stood a yellow-robed elder with an extraordinary countenance, gazing intently at Zhongshan for a long while. Zhongshan noticed that the cabin held nothing else—only ten black jars on the bow and two blue-clad youths standing unevenly before the awning. Assuming the elder would cross directly, the boat instead rowed only two *zhang* or so before turning back, and the yellow-robed figure had already resumed his seat behind the cabin. He stared at Zhongshan once more for a long time before the vessel vanished without a trace. Zhongshan had initially thought him a wealthy merchant and had not spoken to him; now, he was suddenly struck with awe, realizing he had encountered an immortal.\n\nThe next morning, Zhongshan visited Lüxian Temple to pay his respects. The true image of the deity was indeed clad in yellow, with two blue-clad youths standing by his side. His appearance was an exact match to the elder he had seen the day before. Zhongshan lamented his mortal eyes for failing to recognize a true immortal, and his sighs knew no end. He composed a *Shuidiao Getou* lyric, including the line: *\"Again, at the Southern Ford’s port, I met Lord Lü’s boat.\"*\n\nThe following year, Zhongshan passed away. Later, his grandson would show others the portrait his grandfather had painted of the yellow-robed elder—a figure of unparalleled refinement and elegance.\n\n**Eight Principles for Paying Respect to the Confucian Gate**\n*An Audience with Minister Ding*\n\nMinister Ding remarked to his companion from Poyang that when Dongbin and a certain scholar came to pay their respects, Dongbin said: \"I am a descendant of Lü Wei of the Tang. The classics, histories, and all schools of thought—I have mastered them all.\" He then told Minister Ding that his appearance greatly resembled that of Li Deyu, and that his future rise and fall would mirror his as well. Later, Minister Ding indeed rose to the highest office before being exiled beyond the seas—truly, he lived up to the likeness of Zhaorong.\n\n**An Audience with Minister of State Zhang**\nIn his early years, Minister Zhang Ji resided at home. Dongbin visited him and discussed the *Book of Changes* with him, as well as the essence of *Mencius* on preserving the mind and nurturing qi. Zhang’s literary skills flourished thereafter. Dongbin asked for brush and paper and wrote a poem in clerical script, subtly hinting at his future role as a pillar of state. The closing lines read: *\"Success shall come in the year of breaking melons.\"* Zhang later became Minister of State and died sixteen years thereafter. The common saying that \"breaking melons\" refers to the age of sixteen proved to be a prophecy.\n\n**An Audience with the Prefect of Wuchang**\nOne day, the Prefect of Wuchang was playing chess with a companion when a Daoist, who refused to give his name, approached and said: \"I am a master of the game.\" The Prefect tested him, and after only eight moves, the Daoist declared: \"You have lost, Prefect.\" The Prefect replied: \"The board is not yet full—how can you claim I have lost?\" The Daoist said: \"My pieces have already secured the key positions; thus, I know.\" As predicted, the Prefect lost several games in succession. The Daoist then brushed his sleeves and vanished. The Prefect sent men throughout the city to search for him and heard that he was playing a flute in front of the prefectural yamen. When they arrived, the flute’s sound had moved to the East Gate. At the East Gate, it shifted to the West Gate. At the West Gate, it moved to the South Gate. At the South Gate, it was heard at the North Gate. At the North Gate, it came from the Yellow Crane Tower. The Daoist hurried to the Stone Reflection Pavilion, where he disappeared. Only a poem remained in the pavilion:\n\n*\"At Yellow Crane Tower, the flute’s notes rise,*\n*White duckweed and crimson dreams fill the river’s edge.*\n*To whom can I pour out these hidden longings?*\n*Only the clear wind and bright moon understand.\"*\n\nAt the end was signed a single character: *Lü*.\n\n**An Audience with Zhong Ruoweng**\nZhong Chuan, styled Ruoweng, was the military governor of Pingdong. Dongbin, wearing a simple headscarf and a white hemp robe, came to pay his respects, leading a yellow calf by a cowherd boy who stood in the courtyard. Struck by Dongbin’s refined and leisurely demeanor, Ruoweng pointed to the cowherd and said: \"Daoist, can you compose a poem about this?\" Dongbin replied: \"The boy himself can do it.\" He then wrote in large characters:\n\n*\"Grass spreads across the wilds for six or seven li,*\n*Three or four flute notes drift on the evening breeze.*\n*Returning well-fed at dusk,*\n*He sleeps beneath the moon, straw cloak still on.\"*\n\nAfter parting, witnesses saw him carrying two large jars, singing loudly as he left the city. Someone reported to Ruoweng: \"Those two jars—this was Lord Lü!\" Ruoweng hastily pursued him, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\n**An Audience with Shi Guojian**\n\nShi Jie, a steadfast Daoist serving as Direct Instructor at the Directorate of Education, received a visit from a wandering adept who called himself Master Huisou. From his sleeve, the adept produced a poem:\n\n*\"Do not aspire to wander the Phoenix Pool,*\n*The crimson sash and silver seal already grace you with favor.*\n*Lest calamity strike and your name be erased,*\n*Seek the forest springs to nurture your vast virtue—plan ahead.\"*\n\nShi demurred and failed to grasp its meaning, yet he entertained the guest with wine and food. As dusk approached, the old man took his leave, but Shi urged him to stay the night. The adept replied: \"I am but a solitary cloud, a wild crane—how could I be detained?\" A year later, when the rebel Kong Zhiwen plotted treason, Shi was implicated for a letter he had once sent him and was demoted, dying in exile.\n\n**An Audience with Prefect Wang of Yueyang**\nWang Lun, Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, was serving as Prefect of Yueyang when a Daoist adept came to pay his respects. The visitor was gaunt and refined, his short hemp robe barely covering his body, his voice clear and resonant. When Wang inquired about his lineage, the adept replied: \"Lineage is of no matter—what I seek is a game of weiqi.\" They played, and though Wang was renowned as a master, he suffered repeated defeats. As evening fell, Wang poured wine and asked where the adept was from. In response, the adept recited:\n\n*\"The immortal roster bears names in orderly ranks,*\n*A weary traveler from Penglai—Master Lü.*\n*How much can mortal eyes perceive?*\n*Less than the old tree spirit south of the city.\"*\n\nWang was astonished and looked up, but the adept had vanished. Only swirling mist and clouds lingered in the courtyard, lingering for some time before dispersing.\n\n**An Audience with Secretary Shi**\nShi Wangxiu, a Palace Secretary, was escaping the summer heat when a ragged woodcutter approached, axe in hand. His features were refined, his speech crisp and eloquent. When Shi asked about his hometown and lineage, the woodcutter replied: \"This old man was born in Henan but now dwells on Mount Zhongnan, a descendant of Lü Wei. My studies are confined to the *Zhuangzi* and the *Daodejing*—nothing more.\" Shi remarked: \"Zhongnan has fine places.\" The woodcutter replied: \"Indeed, many.\" He then recited a poem by Tao Hongjing:\n\n*\"What does Zhongnan possess?*\n*Only white clouds.*\n*Enough to delight oneself,*\n*But not to bestow upon you.\"*\n\nStruck by this, Shi warmly detained him for two days, engaging in profound discourse on transcending being and non-being, life and death. As they parted, the woodcutter said: \"I am bound for Yueyang.\" He left Shi with a single elixir pill. After consuming it, Shi lived to over ninety, his face as smooth as a child’s.\n\n**Violating Protocol in Baling**\nWhile passing through the market of Baling, Dongbin encountered the prefect making his procession. Ignoring the ceremonial standards, he walked straight into the path of the entourage. The outriders seized him.\n\nThe prefect imprisoned him and ordered him to record his statement, providing him with writing materials each day, yet he uttered not a single word. When the officers pressed him, Dongbin said: \"Wait until I sober up.\" The officers replied: \"How can you not fear punishment, yet still seek wine to ease your troubles?\" Before they finished speaking, he suddenly vanished, leaving behind only a sheet of paper with a poem:\n\n*\"For now I part, to roam the seas of Penglai,*\n*By chance I met the prefect, who asked my origin.*\n*Beneath the Dipper’s handle my true self resides,*\n*My sword hangs at the moon’s horn of the Southern Palace.*\n*When I say I’m drunk, I truly am drunk—*\n*How could I know what sorrow even is?*\n*Why, when we meet, do you fail to recognize me?*\n*I ride the white clouds away, and that is all.\"*\n\nThe prefect exclaimed in shock: \"This is Master Lü!\" At dawn, he rose to burn incense and apologize for his offense. One day, he saw Dongbin in a basin of water. Hastily summoning a painter to capture his likeness, the portrait bore an uncanny resemblance to the one of Teng Zijing. *Records of the Venerable Lü, Scroll Two ends here.*\n\n*Records of the Venerable Lü, Scroll Three*\n*Records of Deeds*\n\nAt Ten Temples on My Pilgrimage\n\n**Inscription at Jine Temple**\nUpon arriving at Jine Temple in Siming, Dongbin surveyed the abbot’s quarters—desolate and still. Presently, a novice emerged. Lü asked why it was so empty. The boy replied, “Do not call it empty—it is the Void itself.” Pleased by his words, Dongbin inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n*The abbot’s door stands ever ajar,*\n*A barefoot boy appears from afar.*\n*I ask why the hall lies so still—*\n*He says it is Void, yet Void it ne’er fills.*\n\nHearing this, how could one not rejoice?\nThe master here is no common voice.\nI came to pay my respects, yet none were found—\nThirst unquenched, my heart stirs dust from the ground.\n\nI depart now, waves vast and wide,\nThe path to Penglai fades in the tide.\nOnce I ascend the stone tower’s height,\nSnow clears, the sea gleams—dawn breaks o’er peaks bright.\n\n**A Dream at Lushan Temple**\nAt Kaiyuan Temple on Mount Lu, the monk Fazhen had sat in meditation for twenty years, his precepts unbroken. One day, as he sat in samadhi, a Daoist appeared and asked, “Master, do you believe the Dao is found only in sitting?”\n\n“Yes,” Fazhen replied.\n\nThe Daoist said, “The Buddha’s precepts demand vigilance. Even in sitting, you claim this mind is absent—but lust and killing are grave matters. When you encounter sights or things, can you truly restrain yourself? Then this mind scatters, untamed by the Dao. Is the Way confined to sitting alone?”\n\nHe led Fazhen through the cloud hall, where a monk lay fast asleep. “Let us sit here awhile and observe,” the Daoist said. After some time, a small snake, over three inches long, emerged from the sleeping monk’s crown. It slithered down the bedpost to the floor, devouring spittle and snot before circling the chamber pot to drink. Then it glided outside, crossed a ditch, and coiled around a flower bed as if pausing to eat. Attempting to cross another small ditch, it recoiled at the overflowing water and turned back. As it approached, the Daoist thrust a small blade into the earth to block its path. The snake shrank back, then wound its way to the bed’s right leg and reentered the monk’s crown.\n\nThe monk awoke with a start and greeted the Daoist and Fazhen. “I just had a dream,” he said. “Let me tell you both. First, I left through the left gate and found a fine feast, which I ate. Then I came upon fine wine and drank my fill. Lifting my robe, I crossed a small river outside the gate, where I saw dozens of beautiful women and gazed at them freely. I tried to cross another small river, but the water had risen too high. A bandit appeared, threatening to kill me, so I fled by a shortcut and reentered through the right gate—then I awoke.”\n\nThe Daoist and Fazhen laughed. “The bedpost was your gate,” the Daoist said, “the spittle and snot your feast, the urine your wine. The ditch was your river, the flowers and trees your women, and the blade your bandit. Such are the illusions of human dreams.”\n\nFazhen asked, “What of the snake?”\n\nThe Daoist replied, “This monk’s nature is venomous and cunning. Its influence has transformed him into a serpent’s form. One day, when he closes his eyes in death, he will be reborn as a snake. Should he not fear this?” Then he turned to Fazhen: “I am Lü. Seeing your sincerity, I have come to teach you the Dao.” Fazhen followed him away, and none knew his fate.\n\n**Gift of Gold at Kaiyuan Temple**\n\nAt Kaiyuan Temple in Yuanzhou, the bathhouse held a great well whose spring water was sweet and crisp. Dongbin grew fond of it and lingered for ten days. He befriended a monk there, who, simple and rustic, treated him with utmost respect, unaware that he was Dongbin. Before leaving, Dongbin gave the monk two ingots of ink as a parting gift, which the monk stored in a bamboo basket and thought no more of. One day, Li Dalin, the transport commissioner, passed through Yuanzhou on an inspection tour of Jiangxi. He sought out the monk and asked, “Did Master Lü ever give you gold?” The monk, startled, replied, “I do not know Master Lü. Some time ago, a Daoist stayed here and gave me ink, but no gold.” He produced the ink to show Li, only to find it had turned to gold. Li rubbed it in astonishment and offered to exchange it for other gold, but the monk refused, gifting him one ingot instead. He then asked how the commissioner had learned of this. Li said, “Yesterday, I passed through Lingmu and saw Immortal He. I asked after Master Lü’s whereabouts, and she said, ‘Recently, Lü passed through here and mentioned he had stayed in Yichun for some time, befriending a monk at Kaiyuan Temple’s bathhouse. He admired the monk’s immortal bearing and Daoist spirit, so he left him gold.’ Hearing this, I came to verify it.” Ten days later, Dongbin returned and asked the monk where the ink was. The monk recounted all that had happened. Dongbin laughed and said, “That woman talks too much.” Then, taking the monk by the hand, he left through the gate, and no one knew where they went.\n\n**Feast at Dayun Temple**\nDongbin, disguising himself as the recluse Hui, visited Dayun Temple and joined the communal meals. After a month, he said to the monks, “The monks here are quite refined, but you lack a bit of fine tea.” He departed, and ten days later returned with a small amount of tea. He prepared it himself, and the hundreds of monks all ate and drank their fill. The monks invited the recluse to share tea, reciting a verse by Minister Ding Jin: *“Flowers break along the monk’s sinew, / buds round as a guest’s cup.”* The recluse said, “The lines are fine, but they do not capture the essence of tea.” He then wrote a poem:\n*“The jade-tipped bud is peerless,\nthe monks’ craft in its making unmatched.\nRabbit-fur cups, shallow and fragrant, clouds of white,\nshrimp-eye bubbles churn in rippling waves.\nIt banishes the demon of sleep from desk and mat,\ninfuses the flesh with pure qi.\nThe hidden groves grow wild beyond the mountain streams,\nunwilling to transplant their roots to the capital.”*\nHe left the monks with a single cinnabar pill, saying, “Take this, and you will not die.” Then he departed. Later, the monks too ascended as immortals.\n\n**The Enchantress at the Mountain Temple**\nDongbin once wandered to a mountain temple, where he transformed his sword into a ravishing woman who entered the temple. The monks gawked, their spirits scattered and wills undone. As she passed the meditation hall, one monk sat in full lotus, eyes unturned. She left the temple, appearing unmoved. Dongbin thought him teachable, but upon exiting the gate, he found the monk already waiting in a secluded spot, his intentions plain—eager to intercept and seduce her.\n\nThe Allure of Women as the Foremost Obstacle to the Dao\n\nThe enchantment of feminine beauty corrupts the heart—its sinful roots are hard to extirpate, and thus it stands as the first hindrance to attaining the Dao.\n\n**The Portrait at Shen Guang Abbey**\nDongbin once wandered to Shen Guang Abbey in Shanyang, where he begged for a brush and painted his own likeness upon the northern wall of the Three Clarities Hall. His brows and eyes were finely wrought, his countenance strange and archaic, unlike the images commonly circulated. Above his head shone the seven great stars of the Northern Dipper, while a celestial sovereign and minister stood with unbound hair, holding jade tablets. Beside them, he inscribed a talisman over a *zhang* in length, writing: *“Painted in the second year of Yuanyou. If you know where my brush began, you may speak with me of the Dao.”* Those who scraped off the talisman and ingested it to cure illness often found swift recovery. Some even beheld a divine figure of imposing presence, who declared, *“I am the Spirit of the Shen Guang Talisman.”* Complaints of its exposure to the elements were met with the construction of a thatched shelter.\n\n**Visiting Friends at Pingdu Abbey**\nIn the prefecture of Zhongzhou, Sichuan, lies Mount Pingdu, where the Han immortals Wang Fangping of the Former Han and Yin Changsheng of the Later Han once sought the Dao together in reclusion. At the mountain’s heart stands Pingdu Abbey, home to the Elixir Cauldron Pavilion and the Chess Pavilion. The Patriarch Lü visited twice, leaving behind a poem:\n\n*On the morning of Ullambana, I passed through Pingdu—*\n*No mountain under heaven compares.*\n*Two solitary travelers, unknown to all,*\n*Wang and Yin’s empty stirrups mocked the clatter of hooves.*\n\nA second poem reads:\n*At first cry, a white crow emerged from Qingcheng;*\n*Again I called upon my two friends, Wang and Yin.*\n*...I long only for the Isles of the Blest,*\n*Yet my gaze has already swept past Dongting’s spring.*\n\n**Poems at Taiping Abbey**\nAt Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, a Daoist of lofty aspirations dwelled. Dongbin, upon visiting, presented him with a poem:\n\n*A ruined genius, Master Xue,*\n*Advanced in years yet beardless still.*\n*Amid clouds, he idly shifts a stone;*\n*Within mountains, he seeks an ancient stele.*\n*He boasts of my great wine,*\n*Scorns others’ petty verse.*\n*What manner of man is this?*\n*Let the rabble sneer as they will.*\n\nAt the end, he inscribed in small script: *“The Returning Daoist, with three companions, visited Alchemist Xue.”* Only then was it known that “Dongbin” was but one of his sobriquets.\n\n**Poems at Tianqing Abbey**\nAt Tianqing Abbey in Fuli County, Suzhou, a young Daoist named Yu studied the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi* with rare insight. One morning, a traveling medicine peddler arrived—none other than Dongbin. His bearing was majestic, and he lingered for over a month, imparting the essentials of the Lao-Zhuang tradition to the Daoist: *“I have observed that Chan teachings all derive from Laozi and Zhuangzi. Though they spin myriad sutras and endless discourses, erecting their own schools and tracing lineages of transmission, in truth, all return to the principles of Lao-Zhuang.”* Before departing, he inscribed two quatrains on the door in large seal script, the strokes soaring and dynamic:\n\n*Autumn’s scene—withered vines, scattered leaves in flight,*\n*Beneath the pine’s shadow, I sit as time drifts by.*\n*Clouds obscure the crane-drawn chariot—where has it gone?*\n*The immortal’s morning audience at the grotto has passed me by.*\n\n*From the elbow, the thousand-year art of cinnabar talismans is passed;*\n*From the mouth, the two scrolls of the* Huangting *are recited.*\n*Within the crane’s abode, by the ancient altar’s pine-shadowed silence,*\n*No footfall stirs—only the door, left ajar for long.*\n\nAfter he left, people scraped off the characters to cure illnesses, often with remarkable success. The ink had penetrated over an inch into the wood, yet its edges remained unfaded.\n\n**Poems at Tianqing Abbey in Shanzhou**\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Lü Huiqing governed Shanzhou’s Tianqing Abbey. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a stranger passed through and inscribed two poems on paper:\n\n*A lone wanderer across the four seas,*\n*Two gourds of frost and snow suffice for spirit.*\n*If you have gathered the two principles of Kan and Li,*\n*Let the dragon-tiger elixir circulate mercury.*\n\n*A wanderer, I was once a guest of Tiantai;*\n*South of the stone bridge lies my old dwelling.*\n*...*\n\nA father and son were born with two mouths,\nLoving song and flute but not clapping.\nHuiqing’s son-in-law, Yu Zhong, explained:\n“The first line of the latter poem is *guest* (宾),\nThe second line’s *stone bridge* is a *grotto* (洞),\nThe fifth line’s *two mouths* is *Lü* (吕),\nThe fourth line is *chant* (吟).\nChanting this poem—was he not the grotto’s guest?”\n\n**Eight Streams Blurred by Market Dust**\n*Wine Shop in Shaozhou*\nOutside Shaozhou’s city walls, an old woman ran a wine shop. One day, a Daoist named Lü arrived, demanding drink. Finding no wine, she gave him a sheng of murky dregs. When he asked the price, she said, “Twenty coins per sheng.” The Daoist pointed at the wine, inscribed twenty characters on a purple stone outside the door, and left. Upon closer inspection, the words had penetrated several *chi* into the stone. From then on, crowds gathered like a wall, and the wine shop thrived. Later, a *Jixian Abbey* was built on the site.\n\n**Yongkang Wine Tower**\nIn Yongkang Prefecture, a man named Ni opened a new wine tower. A Daoist arrived and drank from dawn till dusk, consuming over a *dan* of fine wine. The crowd marveled and gathered to watch. Ni demanded payment, but the Daoist glared in silence, then collapsed drunk. Ni kept vigil beside him. At the first drum of dawn, the Daoist suddenly rose, seized a brush, and wrote a poem on the wall:\n\n*Like a whale’s gulp or turtle’s swallow, hundreds of cups,*\n*Who raises the jade mountain, who topples it?*\n*When sober, two sleeves catch the wind’s chime—*\n*A crimson cloud rises over the sea.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote: *“Composed by Yang Chun of the Three Mountains.”* He threw a clod of earth at Ni’s face, strode out, and gazed northeast as a crimson cloud approached. Clapping his hands and laughing loudly, he vanished. When they scraped the wall, the ink had soaked several *fen* deep. The clod of earth was pure gold. From then on, the wine tower flourished. They realized Yang Chun was none other than *Pure Yang* (纯阳).\n\n**Tea Shop in Bianjing**\nAt the end of the Later Zhou, the Shi family ran a tea shop in Bianjing. Their daughter, still wearing her hair in childish loops, served the tea. Lü Dongbin disguised himself as a beggar, visiting daily to occupy the best seat and demand tea. His clothes were ragged, his flesh filthy with grime—scarcely approachable. Yet the girl showed no disgust, bringing him the finest tea. Her parents grew angry and beat her, but she served him all the more. After a month, he remained unwearied.\n\nDongbin said to her, “Can you drink the dregs of my tea?”\nShe found it too foul to swallow and poured it on the ground. Suddenly, an extraordinary fragrance arose. She hastily licked it, and her spirit felt refreshed.\n\nDongbin said, “I am Master Lü, not a beggar. It’s a pity you couldn’t finish my dregs. Still, I can grant your wish—do you desire wealth, nobility, or longevity?”\nThe girl replied, “I’m a humble girl. I don’t know what nobility is. Wealth and longevity would suffice.”\nDongbin left and never returned. Later, she gained wealth and prominence, living to one hundred thirty-five.\n\n**Rice Shop in Changxi**\nIn Changxi County, Fujian, an old woman ran a rice shop. During the Qiandao era, a Daoist arrived. After eating, he wrote on the wall with a fiery purple brush: *“Lü Dongbin came.”* The characters gleamed with strange brilliance. The prefect heard of it and rode to see, but the words had already vanished, leaving no trace—truly the brush of a divine hand.\n\n**Brothel in Yanzhou**\nIn Yanzhou, a courtesan named Hou ran a lodging house for travelers. Dongbin disguised himself and sought lodging. He left early and returned late, always drunk, and after a month had paid not a single coin. Hou summoned him for tea, but Dongbin said, “I met Master Zhongli. He said you are fit to hear the Dao.”\nHou did not understand and offered him wine. Dongbin drank without cease, and Hou grew increasingly displeased. Dongbin stretched out his arm—golden hairpins glinted beneath his sleeve. He removed one and told her to buy wine. Hou, lured by the gold, said, “Stay the night after drinking.”\n“Very well,” he replied. He climbed onto the bed, snoring loudly. At midnight, Hou approached the bed, but Dongbin pushed her away with his hand. She retreated at once. At dawn, Dongbin was gone. Examining her body, she found where his hand had touched her—*“Lü”* was etched into her skin. Hou realized with awe, “This was Lord Lü! Was it not a single misguided thought in a past life that brought me to this? Has he come to deliver me?” She cut her hair, donned coarse cloth, and set out to find Dongbin, never to be seen again.\n\n**Brothel in Guangling**\nIn Guangling, the courtesan Huang Ying was renowned for her beauty, and wealthy patrons filled her door. One day, a scholar named Lü sought lodging, but Huang rejected him for his ragged, filthy appearance. The scholar wrote two poems on her screen:\n\n*Mengmu and Xishi share this body,*\n*Alas, youth and age span a thousand springs.*\n*One day, a white-haired, wrinkled crone—*\n*Today, a jade-faced beauty in bloom.*\n\n*Flowers bloom and fall, two joys and sorrows,*\n*Flower and person share the same fate.*\n*Blooming on the branch, they fear the guest’s plucking;*\n*Fallen to the earth, who will gaze upon them?*\n\nHe finished writing and vanished in an instant.\n\n**Brothel in the Eastern Capital**\nIn the Eastern Capital, the courtesan Yang Liu was unmatched in beauty. A Daoist frequented her home, often leaving gold and silk, yet never slept with her. One night, drunk, she pressed him, but the Daoist said, “I have united Kan and Li within my body. Husband and wife join internally, the sacred embryo is formed, the infant is about to be born—how could I still desire external beauty? The joy of inner union far surpasses that of outer union.”\nYang was astonished by his words. At the time, the prime minister Zhang Tianjue and his guest Xiao were her longtime patrons. She told Xiao, who relayed it to Zhang. They rushed to her quarters. The Daoist cried out and fled, heading straight for the Cloud-Abiding Hermitage’s meditation hall, where he shut himself in. After a long search, they found him gone. Only a poem remained on the wall:\n\n*One breath shatters the phoenix flute in the Great Clarity,*\n*Green-robed youths chant the *Step of Emptiness*.*\n*The jade tower awakens a thousand-year dream—*\n*On the green peach branch, the golden parrot sings.*\n\nThe hermitage later burned to the ground with nothing left, yet the wall bearing the poem remained untouched—another marvel.\n\n**The Courtesans of Pingkang Lane**\nIn the brothels of Pingkang, one night a man passed by and was seized by the courtesans. The man cried out repeatedly, \"Murder!\" The night patrol arrested several courtesans along with the man and took them to the authorities. The courtesan named Genhu claimed no murder had occurred. When the man was pressed for a confession, he declared himself to be Lü Dongbin, the Immortal, and wrote two poems. The first read:\n\n*A maiden fair as jade, her body soft as cream,*\n*Yet at her waist hangs a sword to slay the foolish.*\n*Though no heads roll from her blade’s swift gleam,*\n*In secret, she drains men’s marrow to the bone.*\n\nThe second poem said:\n\n*Six panels of red silk sweep the floor in grace,*\n*Yet hide a pit where men are lured to fall.*\n*Kings, ministers, and lords all meet this base—*\n*Only this master wakes, untouched by thrall.*\n\nWhen the poems were finished, he turned and vanished—revealing himself as Lü Dongbin.\n\n**Seven Accounts of Hermitages and Gatherings**\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Vegetarian Feast**\nDuring the Xuanhe era of the Song, Emperor Huizong hosted a vegetarian feast for a thousand Daoists, but one place remained unfilled. Just then, a leprous Daoist arrived seeking alms. The gatekeeper vehemently refused him. At that moment, Huizong was conversing with the Daoist Lin Lingsu in the side hall when the leprous man suddenly appeared at the foot of the steps. The emperor hastily sent him to join the feast. The Daoist brushed his sleeve against a pillar as he left, and Huizong, finding it strange, rose to inspect it. Written in powder on the pillar were these words:\n\n*Lofty words and grand debates, as if none else were near,*\n*Alas, the enlightened lord has not met a true seer.*\n*If Your Majesty asks of the days ahead,*\n*Behold the bingwu and dingwei years of spring.*\n\nSure enough, in the jingkang years of bingwu and dingwei, the two emperors were captured in the northern calamity.\n\n**The Crane Gathering at Mount Qingcheng**\nAt the end of the Shaoxing era, Lü Dongbin attended the Crane Gathering at Mount Qingcheng. He rested at the home of a pastry vendor, who did not recognize him. The vendor found him peculiar. Dongbin took thick ink and wrote a poem in bold strokes on a large wooden door:\n\n*Fear only the needle’s heart removed,*\n*True bronze turns to gold in flowing water.*\n*No white strands at the temples prove,*\n*The galloping steed is gone—hard to recover.*\n\nThe poem concealed the characters for \"Lü Dongbin has come.\" The brushwork was powerful and radiant, unlike the ordinary. When the vendor took a knife to scrape it off, the ink had penetrated through to the back of the wood. Dongbin had already vanished. A scholar named Guan Yunxiang witnessed this and painted his likeness—a gaunt Daoist. Thereafter, the vendor’s pastries sold in abundance.\n\n**The Crane Gathering at Tanzhou**\nIn the ninth year of the Chunxi era, on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, Zhao Buwen, the military commissioner of Tanzhou, hosted a Crane Gathering. A Daoist of unknown origin lifted his robes, ascended the steps, and without greeting anyone, entered the main hall’s inner chamber and disappeared. On the table, a sheet of paper was found bearing a quatrain:\n\n*This time our meeting bears no trace of green,*\n*The courtyard’s splendor is a lesser paradise.*\n*With one sword drawn, he soars away again—*\n*The Dongting’s old dragon stirs in surprise.*\n\nAt the end was signed: \"Written by the Valley Guest.\"\n\n**The Shaoxing Dao Gathering at Mount Kuaiji**\nIn the guichou year of the Shaoxing era, a Daoist arrived at the gathering on Mount Kuaiji, clutching a frozen bamboo hat. When the assembly dispersed, he hung the hat upon the wall—though nothing held it, it did not fall. He inscribed a poem:\n\n*By chance I rode the Azure Emperor from Penglai,*\n*My sword and halberd gleaming through the Nine Realms.*\n*Though I stand before your eyes, none recognize me—*\n*I leave this hat behind, lest it sink into oblivion.*\n\n**The Feast Hosted by Minister Jia**\nLady Liangguo, mother of Minister Jia, prepared a feast for wandering Daoists. Suddenly, a group of Daoists arrived, escorting a pregnant woman about to give birth. Before the feast concluded, the woman delivered her child upon the ground. The Daoists then helped her depart, leaving only the infant behind. When the guests lifted the child, they found it was a sword sheath—realizing then that Lord Lü had played a trick on the common folk.\n\n**The White Cloud’s Lodging**\nIn Jizhou, the White Cloud Hall stood near Longqing Temple. Once, a Daoist lodged there, his throat bearing a second mouth with which he blew an iron flute. When he finished, he sealed the opening with paper. Upon his hat were inscribed two lines:\n\n*A single note blown beyond the slanting sun,*\n*Awakens the rivers and lakes of a thousand miles.*\n\nChildren trailed behind him, and he would scatter copper coins upon the ground, letting them scramble for the money. Later, he left a poem on the rear hall’s wall:\n\n*The Herdboy and Weaver Girl,*\n*As ever, in the White Lotus Hall.*\n\nThen he departed, leaving all puzzled by his meaning. Later, when the rebel Li Yuanhao of Meizhou rose in revolt, the White Cloud Hall barred its doors to lodgers, fearing spies. Three years later, it reopened—on the day after the Seventh Night. Only then did they grasp the poem’s meaning, and realize the two mouths formed the character *Lü*.\n\n**Lodging at Jiangzhou**\nAt the ritual platform of Pacification Commissioner Pan in Ruichang County, Jiangzhou, a Daoist arrived seeking lodging. He carried no bundle, no umbrella—only a tattered bamboo hat, dressed in rustic rags. The hall attendant scorned him: *\"With no umbrella, no bundle, how can you lodge here?\"* The Daoist replied: *\"If you refuse me lodging, then grant me a cup of tea before I go.\"* The attendant went inside, bidding him sit, but upon returning, found the Daoist seated in the host’s place. Enraged, the attendant cried: *\"Ignorant of guest and host, what sort of Daoist are you?\"* The Daoist departed without a bow, leaving his hat behind. The attendant could not lift it. Only after gathering the assembly to chant sutras and offer apologies could they raise the hat, beneath which the ground bore the character *Lü*. Those afflicted with illness took the earth, brewed it into a decoction, and were instantly cured. Over the years, a well formed there, its bubbling surface naturally shaping the character *Lü*. When scraped away, it reformed—still visible today.\n\n**Eleven Methods of Elixirs to Aid the People**\n*Medical Treatise of the Wensi Institute*\n\nGovernor Zhao Yingdao oversaw the Wensi Institute when a personal attendant fell gravely ill with sores and convulsions, deemed beyond cure. The man came to bid farewell to the institute’s officials, saying to his disciples: *\"I shall die any day now. My aged mother will be left with no one to rely on—what is to be done?\"* The assembly tried to console him, some weeping in sympathy. As he stepped outside, a Daoist followed him and, after a short distance, said: *\"Your sores are easily healed.\"* He instructed the man to buy two sheets of paper, then scratched two square openings into them, each about three inches across, and handed them over, saying: *\"Burn one sheet tonight, grind the ashes, and mix them with frankincense decoction to apply as a poultice. Keep the other for others in need.\"* The man returned home, applied the medicine as directed, and lay down. Upon waking, he found the sores completely gone, not even a scab remaining. He rushed to the institute to recount the miracle, whereupon the others realized: *\"Two square openings—it is the character *Lü*! Could it be that his near-death plea for his mother, moved by filial devotion, drew the compassion of an immortal to save him?\"*\n\n**The Lame Man of Zhaozhou**\nA poor man named Liu in Zhaozhou had suffered from lameness for twenty years. Each evening, he burned incense at his hearth and prayed to Heaven. One day, a Daoist carrying an iron ladle approached him and said: *\"Follow me.\"* Liu trailed him for about two *li* before the Daoist pointed to the ground and said: *\"Beneath here, over three feet down, lies a five-colored stone. Dig it up.\"* Liu did so and found a stone the size of a pellet, its hues extraordinary. The Daoist instructed: *\"Take it home, expose it to the sun for nine days, then grind it into fine powder. Brew it with quince peel decoction and drink. Once cured, come to the east corridor of Zhuyun Hall in the city—third room on the left—and we shall meet again.\"* Liu’s ailment vanished at once. He went to the hall and found only a mural of Lü Dongbin holding a ladle amid clouds.\n\n**The Blind Man of Jiangling**\nThe Fu family of Jiangling was poor, earning their living by making paper for rituals. Fond of wandering scholars, they welcomed all who passed, offering whatever they could, no matter how meager. The neighbors called him *\"Daoist Fu.\"* Behind his hut stood a small shrine with a statue of Lü Dongbin seated on a boulder, beside which rested an ink basket woven from mud and bamboo strips, holding several bundles of ink sticks. Morning and night, Fu burned incense in devotion. After bowing, he would bar the door, remove the ladder, and forbid even his wife and children from entering. On New Year’s Day of the first year of the Qiandao era, as he sat alone in his shop, a visitor in a square cap and plain robe entered and spoke with him at length.\n\nFu rose and said, \"I happen to have a hundred coins—shall we go to the tavern for a drink?\" Fu followed him. From then on, the visitor came every few days, sometimes staying for wine, sometimes for a meal. Fu’s eyes were dim and wept often. The guest taught him to take equal parts of fresh and prepared *dihuang* (Rehmannia), slice and dry them, remove the seeds from Sichuan peppercorns (discarding any with closed mouths), lightly toast them, then blend all three with honey to form pills. He instructed Fu to take fifty pills on an empty stomach with salted rice broth. Fu prepared the medicine as directed, and after a month, his vision cleared—he could see by day and night.\n\nAfter half a year of visits, the guest suddenly took his leave, saying, \"In a few days, I will travel to Xiangyang. Could you accompany me west?\" Fu declined, citing his heavy burdens. The guest smiled and said, \"I knew you would not go.\" He took up a brush and wrote four characters—*Profit, Luck, Harmony, Union*—and handed them to Fu, saying, \"Post these on your shop wall, and your earnings will increase a hundredfold.\" He then pulled Fu to the tavern to drink in farewell. From his sleeve, he drew a paper packet containing several ink sticks and said, \"I intend to take these to Xiangyang as gifts. Let me leave them with you for now; I’ll retrieve them before I depart.\" After drinking, Fu returned home and placed the ink on the rack.\n\nTwo months passed, and the guest did not return. Fu opened the packet to find it was the Lü Dongbin statue—precisely the one woven from bamboo strips that had stood before the shrine. He searched the basket inside the shrine, but it was empty. Only then did he realize the guest had been Lü Dongbin, and he deeply regretted missing the encounter. He posted the four characters on the wall, and his business flourished daily. He lived to eighty-nine, his ears sharp, his eyes bright, and his vigor like that of a youth.\n\n**The Courtesan of Anfeng Cured**\nAt the end of the Yuanyou era, a courtesan named Sanxiang in Anfeng County fell gravely ill. No treatment cured her, and in her poverty, she took lodgers to support herself. One day, a poor scholar arrived seeking shelter, asking for the best room. The servant, seeing his ragged clothes, refused him, but Sanxiang said, \"Why choose between rich and poor?\" She welcomed him in. Soon after, the scholar heard her groaning in pain and asked the reason. The servant explained. The scholar said, \"I can cure this illness.\" Overjoyed, Sanxiang urged him to help. The scholar sealed her mouth with chopsticks and chanted, \"Turn your heart, turn your heart.\"\n\nAt the time, she did not understand. Outside the door stood a large, long-dead *zaojia* tree. The scholar placed a pill into a crevice in the tree, sealing it with mud. Suddenly, he vanished. That night, the tree sprouted branches and leaves, growing lush by the day. Sanxiang’s illness was instantly cured. Only then did she realize \"turn your heart\" (*hui xin*) referred to Lü (Dongbin). She abandoned her home to seek her master. The townspeople built a shrine to the Perfected One at the site.\n\nIn the fourteenth year of the Shaoxing era, Sanxiang suddenly returned to her hometown, her appearance youthful and radiant. Elders who recognized her told the prefectural governor, Wu Yi Daifu Zize, who summoned her for questioning. She refused to speak in detail, and later, her whereabouts became unknown.\n\n**Selling Medicine in Yueyang**\nLü Dongbin traveled to Yueyang, where he disguised himself and sold medicine, pricing each pill at a thousand gold pieces. After three days with no buyers, he ascended Yueyang Tower, consumed one of his own pills, and suddenly rose into the air. The crowd, astonished and envious, clamored to buy his medicine. Dongbin laughed and said, \"The Dao is before your eyes, yet you tread the paths of Penglai in vain. You grasp the trigger but do not fire—missing it even when face-to-face.\" He then recited a poem:\n\n*At dawn I roam the northern Yue, by dusk the southern Wu,*\n*My sleeve holds the green serpent, my gall bold as a tiger’s.*\n*Thrice I entered Yueyang, yet none knew me—*\n*Reciting verses, I soared over Dongting Lake.*\n\n**Offering the Elixir in Chengdu**\nAt the medicine market in Chengdu, a Daoist with a grimy face and tattered robes held up a single elixir, shouting to the crowd, \"I am Lü Dongbin! Whoever bows to me twice may have this pill.\" The people thought him mad and followed, laughing. The Daoist walked back and forth several times, but no one bowed. He then sat by the large pond in front of the Wuxian Temple. Children pelted him with tiles and stones, but he only smiled and said, \"The world longs to see me, yet when they do, they do not recognize me. Such is fate.\"\n\nLü then consumed the golden elixir himself. Soon, five-colored clouds enveloped him, and he vanished. The crowd was filled with regret.\n\n**The Silk-Wrapped Medicine**\nDuring a year of rampant malaria in the Eastern Capital, an old woman who ran a vegetarian teahouse saw her children and grandchildren all fall ill. One day, a Daoist arrived. The woman treated him kindly and begged him to cure her family. The Daoist said, \"Wait for me tomorrow morning.\"\n\nThe next day, the woman rose early to await him. The Daoist took out a medicine wrapped in fine silk and said, \"When the illness strikes, have the afflicted hold this—all will be cured. One pill can heal a hundred people, but beyond that, it will lose its efficacy.\" The woman followed his instructions, and her family recovered. She then treated a hundred others, but once the number was exceeded, the medicine no longer worked.\n\nShe opened the silk pouch to find the medicine gone—only three characters remained: *Lü Dongbin*. Only then did she realize she had encountered Master Lü.\n\n**Saving a Mother in Xiao Gan**\nIn Tonglu, there was a *Tongshou* (official) whose name is forgotten.\n\nThe official’s mother developed a carbuncle on her back, and despite countless remedies, it would not heal. He prayed fervently, and in a dream one night, Lü Dongbin appeared to him, saying, “Your filial devotion has moved both Heaven and me to come to your aid. If you delay another day, it will be too late to cure.” He then taught him the recipe for *Lingbao* ointment: five dried water chestnuts, five pieces of frankincense the size of jujubes. Grind each ingredient finely, then simmer with one *jin* of white honey to form a paste. Take three *qian* per dose, dissolved in warm wine. The official procured the ingredients, prepared the medicine, and upon taking it, his mother recovered. Later, he distributed it to others, and it proved instantly effective.\n\n**Huang Jueneng Obtains the Elixir**\nHuang Jueneng was renowned for his poetry. One day, while seeing a guest off beyond the eastern gate of the capital, he encountered a Daoist at an inn. He invited the Daoist to share wine and food. Afterward, the Daoist raised his cup, drew the character *Lü* in water, and said, “We shall meet again in Jiangnan next year.” The following year, Huang was indeed transferred to an official post in Jiangnan, where he once more encountered Lü Dongbin. The master gave him seven large coins, ten medium ones, and three small ones, saying, “This number must not be increased.” He also left Huang several elixir pills, instructing him to grind one in wine and take it on New Year’s Day to remain free of illness for the year. Huang followed his instructions, and by the age of seventy-three, his supply of pills was nearly exhausted when he passed away in the eastern capital.\n\n**Li Decheng Attains the Elixir**\nLi Decheng was skilled in medicine.\n\nIn the depths of winter, Li encountered a destitute Daoist, clad in but a single layer of clothing yet showing no sign of cold. The Daoist followed Li into a wineshop and seated himself at the host’s place, which Li found strange. The shopkeeper said, “Pay for the wine first.” The Daoist pointed to three wine jars in the shop and said, “Each contains a pint’s worth of wine money.” The shopkeeper checked and found it to be true, then gave them three pints of wine. The Daoist poured and drank, while Li took only one jar for himself—the other two emptied on their own. The Daoist said to Li, “This is but a minor art. I am Lü Dongbin.” Startled and overjoyed, Li heard the Daoist inscribe a quatrain:\n\nNinefold heavens’ Son gathers the favored few,\nFive-score lords stand revered beyond their gates.\nHow much finer the ragged drunk in wild delight—\nNever yielding his life to the workings of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHe left Li with a single elixir pill, saying, “Take this, and you shall enjoy long life.” Then he departed. After taking the pill, Li’s hair never turned white, his teeth never fell out, and he lived to the age of one hundred and seven before passing away.\n\n**A Shrine and Preserved Formulae**\nTo the left of Sun Yingqi’s villa lay a vacant plot, encircled by water and shaded by trees of rare and quiet beauty. He resolved to build a chamber there in honor of the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang.\n\nNot long after, a ragged Daoist arrived, bowed, and seated himself cross-legged. From his sleeve he produced two tattered volumes of medicinal formulae, pointing them out to Sun and saying, “You may take this ancient prescription, the Six-Ingredient Yin-Nourishing Pill, regularly—it is most excellent.” He also imparted to him the oral instructions of the *Triplex Unity* and *Awakening to Reality*. The Daoist claimed his surname was Zhou and that he was a rustic immortal from Tianchang. He stayed to drink, became intoxicated, and departed, crossing the mountain and vanishing without a trace. Sun then built a chamber and sculpted an image to honor him.\n\nThe prescription is recorded below:\n**Root-Firming Yin-Nourishing Pill**\n- Fresh rehmannia (stir-fried with ginger juice)\n- Prepared rehmannia (steeped in wine and baked)\n- Asparagus root (hearts removed)\n- Ophiopogon (hearts removed), each two *liang*\n- Ginseng, one *liang*\n- Apricot kernel, three *qian*\n\nGrind all into a paste, then blend with refined honey to form pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take seventy or eighty pills on an empty stomach, washed down with rice-water or wine. If preparing as a decoction, combine equal parts of the six ingredients. With prolonged use, the effects manifest swiftly and are most efficacious.\n\n**Four Conditions of Karmic Encounter**\nThe Old Soldier of Maoshan\n\nIn the twentieth year of the Shaoxing reign, Maoshan conducted a grand Daoist jiao ritual. Zheng Qing, the Transport Commissioner of Jiangdong, and Wang Yiyan, a minister, went together to observe. By midday, they rested at a thatched cottage. There they met a Daoist, clad in a white ramie robe and a black cloth headscarf, with long eyebrows and a fine beard, his bearing refined and elegant. Zheng and Wang remarked to each other, \"Could this be the Immortal Lü?\" They summoned him for conversation, invited him to sit, and poured several rounds of wine, by which time both hosts were already drunk. The Daoist asked his guest, \"Can you drink more?\" The guest replied, \"I can.\" \"How much can you take?\" \"Without measure.\" Thereupon, he ordered his attendant to pour two pots of wine into a silver basin, letting the guest drink to his heart's content—one cup after another without cease. Zheng said, \"Master, if you have any elixir, I would beg a few grains.\" The Daoist replied, \"I do.\" He then reached out, scraped the grime from beneath his left armpit, rolled it into green pellets, and gave them to Zheng, saying, \"You may only inhale them, not swallow.\" Wang also asked for some, so the Daoist scraped the dirt from beneath his right armpit, formed red pellets, and gave them to him with the same instruction. When the wine was finished, the guest departed.\n\nEarlier, an old soldier had been guarding the lodging hall, while another old transport soldier lay sleeping under the eaves, not waking even as the day grew late. In jest, the transport soldier placed the two pellets into the old soldier’s nostrils. The qi was immediately drawn in, yet the old soldier remained unaware. Someone roused him and asked, \"How do your limbs feel?\" He replied, \"I feel extremely light, as if I could ascend to the clouds.\" The next day, he rose into the air and departed. The two transport officials looked at each other in regret, realizing they had missed their chance. This was but a borrowed hand to deliver the old soldier.\n\n**Encounter with the Dao: He the Immortal Maiden**\nHe Xiangu was a Daoist maiden from the market of Lingling. At thirteen, she followed her female companions into the mountains to pick tea. Suddenly, she lost her companions and wandered alone, unable to find her way home. On the path, she saw a man beneath an eastern peak—tall, with a long beard, piercing eyes, a lofty cap, and a robe of six layers: it was Lü Dongbin. The maiden prostrated herself repeatedly in haste and bowed to him. Dongbin produced a peach and said, \"You are young and must love fruit. Eat this entirely, and one day you will ascend in flight. If not, you will remain earthbound.\" The maiden could only eat half. The bearded man pointed out her way home. When she returned, she thought only a day had passed, but in truth, a month had elapsed. From then on, she neither hungered nor suffered from bodily leaks, and she could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Later, she departed through *shijie* (corpse liberation).\n\nDongbin once said to the maiden, \"I once wandered the market of Huayin selling medicine. I placed a single grain of spiritual elixir among ten thousand grains of other remedies. When someone sought medicine, I would casually scoop some from the gourd and give it to them, observing their karmic affinity. Over several days, eighty thousand grains of the other medicines were taken, yet this elixir would fall from the hand the moment it was grasped. Alas, how rare it is to encounter one with the bone structure of an immortal in this world!\"\n\n**Encounter with the Dao: Liu the Lame Immortal**\nLiu the Lame Immortal of Changsha met Dongbin on Junshan and received the method of the灵龟吞吐 (Spiritual Tortoise’s Inhalation and Exhalation). After mastering the practice, he retired to Mount Yuelu and styled himself Master of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. He often accompanied Dongbin to and from Baohuang Cave. Dongbin frequently wandered beneath the city walls and wrote a poem:\n*\"Of the seventy-two peaks of the Southern Mountains,\nI love only the cave of true emptiness.\"*\nLater, a man named Zheng Si encountered the Lame Immortal outside the Qingtai Gate, and together they ascended as immortals.\n\n**Daoist Friends Discussing Scriptures**\nChen Danran was a wealthy scholar who admired the Dao. For many years, he invited wandering Daoists to stay, yet he never encountered a true master. Dongbin disguised himself as a laborer and worked in Chen’s garden for over a year, performing tasks with strength beyond that of ordinary men. Chen grew fond of him but treated him as nothing more than a hired hand. One day, Chen and a Daoist friend were discussing the *Yinfu Jing* (Scripture of Hidden Agreement). When they reached the passage, *\"Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism; heaven and earth are overturned,\"* they could not fathom the meaning of the \"killing mechanism.\" Dongbin, standing nearby, spoke up loudly: *\"That which is born does not live; that which dies does not perish. To kill the living after it is born, or to learn death before it is absent—this is the way to long life.\"* Chen rebuked him angrily: \"Are you not a laborer? Who taught you to speak thus?\" When pressed further, Dongbin deliberately garbled his words, making them incomprehensible. The Daoist friend said, \"This rustic must have overheard such talk somewhere. He does not truly understand it.\"\n\nSoon after, Dongbin suddenly took leave of Chen, saying, \"I will travel far. I shall return on the fifth day of the fifth month next year at noon.\" After his departure, all was quiet. Later, one of Chen’s fellow townsmen was visiting Baling and encountered Dongbin, who said, \"Tell Master Chen for me: I am Lü Dongbin. At first, I thought he might be worthy of receiving the Dao, but upon closer observation, I saw otherwise. I shall not return.\" With that, he walked into the bamboo grove of the Lüxian Pavilion and vanished. On the noon of the fifth day of the fifth month the following year, Master Chen suddenly died.\n\n*Record of the Patriarch Lü, Scroll Three—concluded*\n*Record of the Patriarch Lü, Scroll

cultivation, merits complete,\nThe crane’s banner heralds the audience with the Perfected.\n\nThe Dao penetrates, the mysterious penetrates further,\nA name left to spread across the four seas.\nTo kin, a single staff,\nTo harmony, two empty fists.\nTo bear fruit, plant the seeds without delay,\nTo refine bitterness, heat it without pause.\nLittle did they know, coming to blend with the world,\nSoon they would return to heaven.\n\n**Forty-Two Quatrains in Seven-Character Style**\n\nSeizing the golden essence to secure life’s foundation,\nThe sun’s soul to the east, the moon’s radiance to the west.\nWithin, the elixir of long life is refined—\nConsumed, one equals heaven and earth.\n\nNo wonder the Jade Pool’s news is scarce,\nFor human affairs veil celestial mechanisms.\nIf one finds the fire within water,\nA Yellow Lad ascends to the Grand Tenuity.\n\nIn the primordial sea’s depths, hidden are the ranks of life,\nWithin, the Yellow Lad bears the Jade Emperor’s name.\nThe White Tiger’s divine talisman conceals the Crone,\nThe numinous origin resides in the Seven Primes.\n\nThree acres of cinnabar field, no seeds to sow,\nWhen planting, one must borrow the Crimson Dragon’s plow.\nI once taught others to plant this seed,\nThose who fail to follow the pool’s path will not thrive.\n\nThe tiger and dragon’s flashing divine swords fly,\nRely on bodily discipline, do not transgress.\nTransmission requires the power of heaven and earth,\nThen one pierces the Three Clarities to enter the Purple Tenuity.\n\nNo need for ladders or matchmakers to seek without,\nThe returned elixir is gathered within the body.\nDo not say the Great Dao is hard for people to attain—\nIt is only that the work has not reached its culmination.\n\nDrink wine, let it be a hundred cups,\nEastward floating, westward drifting, naturally ascending.\nThe sun’s essence can unite with the moon’s radiance,\nAnd a bright pearl rises forth.\n\nUnburdened by the two luminaries, unburdened by others,\nNeither deceiving the divine way nor the impoverished.\nIf one asks me of the method of cultivation,\nOnly plant the heart-field and nurture oneself.\n\nIf mortals aspire to reach Penglai,\nFirst cross the towering eighteen peaks.\nAs thunder’s roar shakes the earth,\nA pool of golden water flows eastward.\n\nThe vessel like gold, the Jade Lad yellow,\nAscending and descending, extending divine light.\nThe Three Primes converge over years of strife,\nThis heaven’s sun and moon endure long.\n\nTo learn the Dao, one must be utterly destitute,\nWith only a few coins in one’s purse.\nIf one asks me of the method of cultivation,\nI point afar to the sun and moon on the horizon.\n\nI forget my heart, my spirit delights,\nStriding over water, piercing clouds to visit.\nNot inquiring of the Yellow Sprout’s elixir behind the elbow,\nHow can one speak of the subtle path through gauze?\n\nThe elixir transmitted behind the elbow, an art of a thousand years,\nReciting the two scrolls of the *Yellow Court*.\nIn the crane’s abode, the ancient altar amid pine shadows,\nSilent, no footprints, the door forever ajar.\n\nAlone I ascend the high peak to gaze upon the Eight Capitals,\nBlack clouds disperse, the moon remains solitary.\nBoundless the cosmos, numberless its people—\nHow many men among them are true husbands?\n\nRoaming all under heaven takes but half a day’s work,\nNo need to ride phoenix or mount dragon.\nBy chance in a game of chance, my spirit-sword takes flight,\nShattering the first peak of Mount Zhongnan.\n\nI overturn the gourd, strike aside the zither,\nWalking backward, I ascend beyond Oxherd Summit.\nWater flies from stone, bursting like snow,\nStanding I gaze at heaven, sitting I chant.\n\nMy home was originally at Heaven’s Pivot,\nScattered like drifting white clouds, melting the stone steps.\nComing and going eight thousand leagues consumes half a day,\nYet the old return path remains unlost.\n\nThe Daoist of Yellow Peak is lofty and pure,\nHe does not descend from the Lotus Palace for years.\nBy night he bows to stars, his jade hairpin chilled,\nBy dawn the dragon and tiger stir, the golden crucible hot.\n\nSuddenly we meet by the eastern mountainside,\nGrasping hands, we exhort each other, voices ringing like bells.\n“Your swordcraft is complete—take it with you,\nWhere dragons dwell, there slay dragons.”\n\nAt dawn I sail to Cangwu, by dusk I return,\nWithin the grotto, sun and moon—here I am heaven.\nThe casketed treasure-sword roars from time to time,\nYet without meeting one of like kind, I vow not to transmit it.\n\nThe Feathered Immortal claps hands, the gourd dances,\nCrossing ridges, piercing clouds, the staff flies.\nComing and going eight thousand leagues takes but half a day,\nBy the southern slopes of Jinzhou, pine gates stand.\n\nCultivating a form like mine, my body withers to a dry catalpa,\nWhile the disciple’s essence gleams.\nLife after life, ever thus—\nHow could it compare to nurturing one’s own spirit?\n\nNurture the numinous root with essence, the spirit with qi,\nBeyond this truth, there is no truth.\nThe immortals refuse to speak plainly,\nMisleading millions upon millions.\n\nI serve no kings, till no fields,\nAt high noon I still lie abed, lute in arms.\nRising, I casually mint gold,\nLest others ask for alms-money.\n\nFrom the ends of the earth, people seek me,\nYet walking to the earth’s end, I find no one.\nLoyalty, filial piety, righteousness, compassion—practice convenience,\nNo need to seek me; you will naturally attain perfection.\n\nThose who call recluses idle know nothing—\nIn stillness, they perfect their work.\nClosing the door on a bright day, reading ends,\nSweeping the floor, burning incense until dusk.\n\nCease essence, cease qi, nurture the spirit,\nRefine essence in the cinnabar field, the body with qi.\nWhoever masters this art\nBecomes an immortal, deathless.\n\nA bamboo hat for a sail, a fan for a boat,\nRoam the Five Lakes and Four Seas at will.\nIn an instant, traverse the great thousand worlds,\nThough stones rot and pines wither through countless autumns.\n\nSome become Daoists, some monks,\nBlending with the world, their light veiled, yet gifted.\nThe bitter sea transforms into a celestial path,\nDipamkara ever lights hundreds of thousands of lamps.\n\n**Crossing Dongting Lake at Jun Mountain**\nBy midnight, the moon returns over Jun Mountain,\nIn the western neighbor’s small garden, green lotuses bloom.\nHeavenly fragrance, wind, dew—azure blossoms crystalline,\nThe bud lingers in the blue firmament, the crane has not yet come.\n\n**Presented to Tianqing Abbey in Fengxiang Prefecture**\nEight hundred autumns since attaining the Dao,\nNever once has my flying sword taken a head.\nUntil the Jade Emperor’s celestial decree arrives,\nI peddle black gold to mingle with the world’s flow.\n\n**Drawing a Sword in the Snow at Xiangyang**\nJian Mountain, one night, the jade dragon grows cold,\nIn Phoenix Grove, a thousand trees age like pear blossoms.\nWithin Xiangyang’s walls, few know—\nBeyond Xiangyang’s walls, the rivers and mountains are fair.\n\n**Encountering Zhao Tong at Sea**\nIn the Southern Palace, water and fire—I must aid,\nAt the Northern Pass, husband and wife—I myself am matchmaker.\nWithin the grotto, the dragon-child is proud and spirited,\nBefore the mountain, the lad delights in lingering.\n\n**Five Poems Presented to a Swordsman**\nSir, sir, your visage fierce and grim,\nDrawing your sword midair, qi and clouds clash.\nThree sharp shouts, swiftly you depart,\nWith a *clang*, an empty space—where a head once fell.\n\nThe sword rises, stars scatter like ten thousand pearls,\nWind and thunder follow, rain roars in the valleys.\nWhere the head is carried, no man remains—\nWhy chant loftily as you cross the Five Lakes?\n\nBrows knit, spirit resolute, voice like thunder,\nHearing of injustice, you cast aside your cup.\nWielding your sword midair, a thousand leagues you go,\nDeparting at the first watch, returning by the second.\n\nBushy brows, stalwart frame, fierce spirit,\nTen thousand leagues you leap into the void.\nOn your back, in its sheath, a three-foot sword—\nFor heaven, you show yourself as one who rights wrongs.\n\nSir, sir, seek not without,\nThe Dao must be transmitted, the sword must be sheathed.\nToday we meet by rivers and seas—\nA cup of village wine, I urge you to cease.\n\n**Presented to Master Cao**\nThe crane does not fly west, the dragon does not move,\nDew dries, clouds part, the grotto’s flute is clear.\nA young immortal speaks of idle matters,\nFrom afar, beyond colored clouds, a sigh is heard.\n\n**To Chan Master Huijue of Zhidu Temple in Tanzhou, with Preface**\nI traveled from Shaobin, eastward down the Xiang River.\nNow I meet Master Jue—\nObserving his Chan study, keen and bright,\nHis nature’s source pure and unsullied.\nKnees drawn close, he sits in stillness, gathering light within.\nBeyond his sleeve, no extra robe;\nBeyond his bowl, no extra food.\nHe has reached the shore of life and death,\nShattered the shell of afflictions.\nNow the Buddha’s robe lies silent, untransmitted,\nChan’s principle hangs precariously, nearly lost.\nWho will uphold and revive it?\nPerhaps it rests with my teacher.\n\nThe enlightened aid others with their minds,\nSages and worthies transmit the Dharma without departing from truth.\nI ask the master to expound the meaning of the Western advent—\nNow, who is the seventh patriarch?\n\n**An Idle Inscription**\nWalking alone, sitting alone,\nCountless people in the world do not know me.\nOnly the old tree spirit south of the city\nClearly knows I am an immortal passing by.\n\nPines wither, stones age, waters coil,\nHere, vulgar guests are hard to teach.\nFrom the terrace’s vantage, gaze at the scenery beyond—\nHurried winds stir, obscuring yellow dust.\n\n**Sixty Quatrains in Seven-Character Regulated Verse**\nThe twin passes of the spine pierce the crown gate,\nThis is the direct path of cultivation, its root.\nFrom the Flowery Pond, divine water frequently swallowed,\nThe Purple Palace’s original lord aids the crossing.\n\nConstantly let qi surge through joints and passages,\nNaturally, essence fills, the Valley Spirit extends.\nIn years to come, when attending the Jade Pool assembly,\nYou must remember the one who first taught you.\n\n**The Art of Qi Regulation**\nChaotic and undifferentiated, years uncounted,\nOne inhalation barely records five thousand words.\nRefining the elixir, concocting medicine, Southern Mountain’s beauty,\nAbsorbing qi, swallowing auroras, the nine seas dry.\n\nHow many times have my brows and temples brimmed?\nHow often have the seas turned to mulberry fields?\nIf Your Majesty asks my age,\nFirst came my body, then came heaven.\n\n**To You, This Composition**\n\nOur ancestral Dao is fundamentally non-action,\nIn the white-snow gourd, Kan and Li unite.\nOften I drink three cups of carefree wine,\nLeisurely I play a game of uncontentious chess.\n\nExtracting lead, adding mercury to preserve the true form,\nReturning to the root, restoring the foundation of life.\nWhen you grasp these two merging into one,\nAt last, you ascend the celestial ladder.\n\n**Probing the Mysteries**\n\nAlone I traverse, surpassing all peers,\nSilent and dim, enduring since ancient times.\nFormless and shapeless, it subtly creates,\nWith gates and doors within Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt the boundary of form and formlessness, who can fathom?\nIn the midst of emptiness and non-emptiness, the root is self-attained.\nThis Dao is not obtained from without—\nA thousand words, ten thousand phrases are but idle discourse.\n\nA single grain of numinous true cinnabar,\nNot placed at the ends of heaven or earth.\nDelving into scriptures yields no depth,\nClimbing mountains or facing waters reveals nothing.\n\nIts radiance secretly dwells on the peak of the unseen,\nIts brilliance resides high in the chaos’ origin.\nIf the world could but know its abode,\nTranscending the mundane to become a sage would be effortless.\n\n**Fallen Among Red Dust for Forty Springs**\n\nForty years adrift in the red dust,\nNon-action, non-affair, trusting in natural truth.\nMy livelihood rests only in the cauldron of Heaven and Earth,\nMy sustenance depends solely on the wheel of sun and moon.\n\nWithin the qi of the Eight Trigrams lies the supreme treasure,\nWithin the light of the Five Agents hides the primordial spirit.\nThough mulberry fields transform, it remains unchanged,\nForever a transcendent among mortals.\n\n**Alone Amidst the Myriad Forms of Heaven and Earth**\n\nFrom the beginning, I meticulously cultivate primordial work.\nWielding the Northern Dipper with vast intent,\nInverting the Southern Stars with bold courage.\n\nGhosts wail and spirits howl as the golden crucible congeals,\nPhoenixes soar and dogs transform as the jade furnace empties.\nHow can the vulgar world seek it in the ordinary?\nWithout attaining the unseen, it cannot be fathomed.\n\n**Who Would Believe the Flowery Pond’s Path Runs Deepest?**\n\nNeither near nor far, its mystery is hard to find.\nNine years of refinement like red jade,\nOne day of perfection like purple gold.\n\nOnce attained, it forever resists cold and heat,\nConsumed, it shields against life and death.\nI urge you, cultivators beyond the gate,\nFocus your thoughts on this Dao of the heart.\n\n**From the Water Palace, Seek Lead to Merge with Fire-Lead**\n\nBlack to red, red to black—profoundly obscure.\nQi generates qi, transforming flesh and skin,\nEssence contains essence, unifying life and nature.\n\nWhen the medicine returns, you become a true Daoist,\nWhen the elixir reverts, you are a sage embryo immortal.\n\"Exiting spirit, entering samadhi\"—empty words,\nWasting effort for ten thousand years in vain.\n\n**Nine Crucibles Refine Nine-Turned Sand**\n\nPrecisely dividing the seasons without error.\nSpirit, essence, qi, and blood return to the three essentials,\nNorth and south, east and west unite as one family.\n\nHeaven and Earth transform, white snow flies,\nYin and Yang harmonize, golden blossoms bloom.\nUltimately, phoenix music descends from the void,\nRiding tigers and dragons amidst purple clouds.\n\n**Observe at Noon and Midnight, My Lord**\n\nA single pulse of the Celestial Ford lies at the spine’s end.\nWithin the Golden Gate hides the Mysterious Valley Child,\nIn the Jade Pool sits the Palace of Supreme Harmony.\n\nApply only the most wondrous three-cycle fire,\nTo refine the numinous nine-turned elixir.\nI directly point to the many seekers of the Dao—\nIn action or stillness, never stray from Tiger-Dragon Shoal.\n\n**Returning to the Root, Restoring the Origin, Dao-Qi Levels**\n\nVoid yet not form, it becomes increasingly distinct.\nIn water, white snow subtly congeals,\nIn fire, golden lotuses gradually bloom.\n\nWhen discussing sacred mercury, it has no form,\nWhen examining true lead, it too has no name.\nI now speak for those who cultivate like mothers—\nDo not ask about refining gold, but about the utmost essence.\n\n**Arrange the Crucible and Turtle to Refine the Mysterious Root**\n\nAdvance and retreat—know the gates of Mao and You.\nLightning encircles clouds, sun and moon fly,\nDriving dragons and tigers out of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOne pill bestows upon the lord of youth,\nNine turns can burn away the marks of white hair.\nThis Dao is subtle, few understand it—\nIn this vast world, with whom can I discuss it?\n\n**Brewing a Cup of Wine, Composing a Poem**\n\nDrunk at dusk, chanting at dawn, I lose track of years.\nThe Qian horse often roams the nine earths,\nThe Kun ox at times emerges from the three heavens.\n\nIn the White Tortoise Grotto, husband and wife meet,\nIn the Azure Phoenix Nest, mother and child unite.\nLifting the numinous child to gaze from the mountain,\nLayer upon layer, they are golden coins.\n\n**Recognizing East and West, Wood and Fire**\n\nNaturally, the furnace and crucible roar with tiger and dragon.\nSimply follow Heaven and Earth to discern the signs,\nThen you will know Yin and Yang’s faithful sounds.\n\nLeft hand grasps the Southern Stars, plucking crane feathers,\nRight hand holds the Northern Pole, splitting the tortoise’s heart.\nThe immortals personally left this decree—\nWhy trouble yourself with external seeking?\n\n**The Heavenly Mechanism Runs Deeper Still**\n\nVain are words of ten thousand kalpas and a thousand gold.\n\nAmidst the three winters, scorching heat—fire within the profound,\nIn the sixth month’s frost, biting cold—Yin beyond the surface.\nGold, when floating, reveals its nature at last,\nWood, once sunken, discloses its heart in time.\nThe Five Phases inverted hold the subtle signs,\nReturning to the root and restoring the origin lie within one’s own seeking.\n\nThe tiger generals and dragon armies, majestic in qi and bearing,\nDon their talismans and armor, hastening away.\nSwords and halberds arrayed, they charge like lightning,\nBanners and standards aligned, they rush swift as the wind.\nThey capture the Three Corpses alive and burn the demon’s lair,\nSeize the Six Bandits alive and shatter the palace of delusion.\nWhen rivers run clear and seas are calm, Heaven and Earth vie in harmony,\nGeneration after generation dwells secure within the Dao and virtue.\n\nI till my own field with diligence,\nWithin it, the numinous sprout thrives for ten thousand years.\nIts blossoms gleam like yellow gold, though their buds stay small,\nIts seeds resemble white jade, each round and perfect.\nIts cultivation relies wholly on the soil of the Central Palace,\nIts irrigation depends entirely on the springs of the Upper Valley.\nWait until the nine years’ work is complete,\nThen uproot it whole and ascend to the Great Luo Heaven.\n\nOrdinary seekers of the Dao speak of the Yellow Sprout,\nYet wander ten thousand rivers and a thousand mountains in vain.\nSome are jagged, some round—hard to plant,\nRootless and footless, yet they bloom of themselves.\nIn the Nine-Three Crucible, they simmer like curds,\nIn the Six-One Furnace, they congeal like rosy clouds.\nSoon the elixir forms, transforming the bones,\nAnd one soars aloft, pointing toward the Jade Emperor’s abode.\n\nAt the crossroads of the Four and Six, the path lies smooth and level,\nTravelers who reach this point need not fear.\nLet the ox-cart rumble and turn,\nLet the goat-chariot creak and roll.\nCrossing seas and fording rivers, few obstacles remain,\nAscending to Heaven or descending to Earth, no peril tilts the way.\nOnce the work is done, enter the Hall of Eternal Life,\nAnd from one’s sleeve, draw forth the divine pearl, shining through the night.\n\nWhen Nine and Six unite, the Dao and qi harmonize,\nThe River Chariot day and night surges with golden waves.\nWith each exhalation, it turns at every pass,\nWith each inhalation, it rubs along the pulse points.\nLightning flashes at the Gate of Li, illuminating sea and mountain,\nThunder roars at the Door of Zhen, shaking the dancing realm.\nReflect on this Dao—truly vast and boundless,\nYet many learners drown in the river of desire.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is no small golden elixir,\nWithin the yin crucible and yang furnace it rests secure.\nAll say it’s easy to seek mercury at Mount Shu,\nYet who knows the difficulty of finding lead in the Western Sea?\nThe journey to the Cavern of the Mystic Pearl is not far,\nAt the Ford of Red Waters, the path is straight and true.\nOnce you grasp the true way of the numinous pole,\nWhy trouble yourself with moon rites or star-altar steps?\n\nThe mechanism of past and present is most clear,\nYet it is only that the strength of all beings is slight.\nAll seek being within being, substance within substance,\nWho can perceive formlessness within the formless?\nTrue lead and sacred mercury are but vain expenditures,\nThe Jade Chamber and Golden Pass remain unopened.\nOnce the cinnabar gourd of original nature is overturned,\nOne swallows pills, awaiting the extension of years.\n\nFleeting fame and fleeting profit—how can they endure?\nTurning one’s head toward the mountains, the flavor grows sweet.\nIn this world, none share a heart that truly accords,\nWho else can engage with the Dao in mutual inquiry?\nAn inch not yet attained, one glibly speaks of a foot,\nOne not yet understood, one forcibly expounds on three.\nScriptures, gourds, and staffs as before,\nAre carried back into old Jiangnan.\n\nOriginally there is no sitting, nor is there walking,\nTo walk or sit is but delusion.\nLaozi’s words remain unexhausted,\nYet even more obscure are the sayings of Gautama.\nThe numinous pole, jointed, ascends to Heaven,\nThe supreme medicine, rootless, is born of Earth.\nToday I withhold nothing from you,\nFor when the work is done, this alone is Penglai.\n\nTo grasp the fire-seed and plant the knife’s measure,\nWho in this world knows of fire-seed or knife’s measure?\nThe eldest son of the mountain rides a white horse,\nThe maiden by the water herds a black tortoise.\nFrom non-being emerges being—the image of the Returned Elixir,\nWithin yin, yang is born—the foundation of the Great Dao.\nThe inversion of the Five Agents depends on the craftsman’s hand,\nWithout meeting the craftsman’s hand, do not act.\n\nOf the three thousand and more methods of cultivation,\nThe first and closest path is the firing of the elixir.\nIt must be the true substance of the Kan male,\nTo take the Li female is naturally precious.\nRefine the mercury within the sand to become deathless,\nCongeal the silver within the water to attain longevity.\nWhen the nine cycles and nine returns are complete,\nSurely the decrepit will be restored to youthful spring.\n\nTo plant the root of deathless longevity,\nNurture again the yin po and yang hun.\nFirst instruct the Mystic Woman to return to the Li chamber,\nThen dispatch the Empty King to guard the Kan gate.\nWhen the tiger reaches the jia border, the wind howls,\nWhen the dragon dwells within geng, the waters are warm.\nThose lost on the path lightly divulge these secrets,\nThis principle must be entrusted to those who comprehend.\n\nWith eyes closed, visualize the spirit in the Jade Gate,\nAs the time arrives, the fire-timing is transmitted in turn.\nClouds soar over the sea as the dragon swallows mercury,\nWind strikes the cliff’s peak as the tiger subdues lead.\nOnce the treasure within the body is refined,\nThe mystery of the Dao is casually grasped.\nAfter ingesting the knife’s measure, the scripture of the elixir descends,\nLeaping beyond the dusty dragon to ascend the Nine Heavens.\n\nA thousand days of effort, never idle,\nThe River Chariot bears its load up Mount Kun.\nThe tiger claps white mercury within the furnace,\nThe dragon emits red lead toward the crucible’s query.\nThe immortal registry records the name as the elixir ripens,\nThe netherworld’s ledger removes the entry as life is restored.\nOn what clouds do the feet alight as they return?\nStraight into the Three Purities to thank the sacred countenance.\n\nTo match true yin with correct yang,\nThree years of work complete, frost congeals.\nThe divine tortoise enters and exits the geng-xin position,\nThe cinnabar phoenix soars in the jia-yi direction.\nThe nine tripods first radiate twin auspicious qi,\nWithin the three primals, the five hairs’ light is renewed.\nIf in the dust there are those of like mechanism,\nTogether we shall dwell in the misty heavens of the deathless land.\n\nThe path of cultivating life is difficult within,\nThe deluded merely pore over ten thousand scrolls.\nWater and fire balanced—this is the medicine,\nYin and yang askew—no elixir forms.\nAbide in the feminine without losing the masculine to dwell,\nIn darkness, without deficiency, the white naturally dries.\nRecognizing this true and wondrous secret,\nWhy fear wind and rain hastening decay?\n\nHaving swallowed but a single grain, one is at peace,\nThe twelve-storied tower and nine-bend stream are linked.\nThe geng tiger circulates, feeding on sharp snow,\nThe jia dragon writhes, spouting numinous springs.\nLü’s second corresponds to three thousand days,\nWithin the nine nines, ninety thousand years extend.\nOnly when there is affinity may it be transmitted,\nNever lightly divulged to others.\n\nWho knows of the divine water in the Jade Flower Pool,\nWithin which lies the foundation of life and destiny?\nIts operation depends on dragon and tiger,\nIts drawing and adding rely entirely on Kan and Li.\nMorning and evening, the yellow gold powder is exhausted,\nIn an instant, the jade-like marrow is refined.\nAfter a thousand days of abstinence and ingestion,\nOne casually ascends the cloud ladder.\n\nThe clouds of the Nine Heavens are still, the crane flies lightly,\nHolding the bamboo slip, it flits away from the Great Purity.\nThe red dust beyond the body changes at will,\nThe white stone within the furnace forms in an instant.\nThe nine-plumed phoenix dances in the void,\nFive-colored clouds arise beneath the feet.\nTurning the head, one returns to the heavens above,\nWishing to bring sweet rain to parched mortals.\n\nThe infant descends the jade steps in leisurely fashion,\nHolding the mystic pearl, it comes straight down.\nAt midnight, purple clouds drape its plain form,\nSeveral times, crimson qi veils the peach’s bloom.\nIn its faint smile, the mechanism turns,\nAs it lightly moves, doors and windows open.\nThis is the true child of my family,\nHow could the foolish and ignorant casually guess?\n\nAs soon as the heavenly tally descends from the Jade Capital,\nThree thousand days accumulate effort.\nPraying to Heaven and Earth, the golden crucible opens,\nGathering yin and yang, the jade pot is sealed.\nSuddenly, the mortal frame is capable of transformation,\nDeeply knowing the wondrous Dao is no empty scheme.\nWhen the time comes, ask the elders in the dust,\nDoes this mystery exist in the world?\n\nWho recognizes the accomplished ones in the world,\nThose who in their lives understand the method of silver in water?\nA single staff props up Heaven and Earth,\nA three-foot Kunwu sword slays gods and demons.\nDeeply drunk, they sleep in the moonlit grotto,\nLoftily chanting, they scorn the red dust.\nSince awakening within, for the rest of their lives,\nThey have won the eternal spring of Penglai.\n\nThe red furnace advances the ridicule to refine golden essence,\nA single numinous pearl pierces the chamber with light.\nShaking Heaven and Earth reveals the power of the Dao,\nEscaping life and death demonstrates the work’s progress.\nCarefree, they leave traces across the Four Seas,\nReturning to the Three Purities to establish their names.\nStraight up the five-cloud path, the journey is steady,\nPurple simurghs and vermilion phoenixes come to welcome them.\n\nIf people of this age wish to learn longevity,\nFirst, the pivot must move day and night.\nWithin the indistinct, focus the will and qi,\nWithin the void, solidify the original essence.\nDragon befriends tiger, three cycles complete,\nHare runs, crow flies, nine returns are achieved.\n\nHaving refined a crucible of sacred elixir,\nThe path home through the five-colored clouds grows clear.\nNo gain nor loss, no words to speak—\nIn motion, they perform their work; in stillness, they rest.\nThey drive the crimson ox to plow the cosmos,\nScatter jade grains to sow the mountains and rivers.\nCultivating without fear of a thousand days’ labor,\nThey know that partaking grants ten thousand years of life.\nToday I show you, for you are trustworthy—\nI teach you to become an immortal in this world.\nNo need for pairs or trios,\nOnly at Kunlun’s first crag.\nWhen moisture comes, the passions naturally submit;\nWhen heat arrives, the nature fears it cannot be tamed.\nAt times they enter the Three Primordials’ gate,\nWhen idle, they return to the Nine Bends’ river.\nIn this world, some can endure the firing—\nTheir lifespan matches Heaven and Earth, peerless in all.\nFrom beginning to end, all lies within the Jade Capital,\nThough once they walked the earth as ordinary men.\nFirst, they swallowed essence and consumed qi from the realm of being,\nThen, awakening to principle, they returned to truth and entered non-being.\nWater and fire naturally achieve the *ji ji*,\nYin and yang harmonize and correspond of themselves.\nFrom the furnace, the elixir of extended years is refined,\nWhile the seas and tides may shift from flourishing to withering.\nFree from fame and profit, they roam at ease,\nMeeting wine and song, they join in the revelry.\nFor years, they have not passed through the sacred gates,\nA thousand years they dwell only in the immortal realm.\nThrice they advance with water and fire,\nTruly, husband and wife are gathered in one place.\nOnce the elixir is complete and the work accomplished, the body takes flight,\nLeaving the dusty chamber to rise above the mortal stream.\nVast and boundless, ask not where it ends—\nCarving insects and seal script are but the blossoms of the Dao.\nOnly by guarding the center and forsaking learning does one grasp the profound;\nEmbracing the One in silence, one first perceives the sublime.\nThere is a thing like the yellow chrysanthemum’s pistil,\nYet no color like the green peach blossom.\nDo not wear out the mind’s earth with vain effort,\nFor smelting iron and refining gold only leads further astray.\nWhen the returning elixir’s work is complete but they have not yet ascended to Heaven,\nThey first guide others among men to find their own verdant path.\nA staff at both ends bears the sun and moon,\nA single gourd conceals the mountains and rivers.\nPoems flow freely in moments of leisure,\nWine is drunk in abundance, leaving coins behind in drunkenness.\nIf you ask what wondrous method I cultivate,\nIt is none other than the mercury and lead within the body.\nHalf red, half black—the mystery of the Dao,\nWater nurtures true gold, fire nurtures lead.\nThey reconnect the three inches of qi from past years,\nAnd circulate it through one cycle of Heaven.\nThe refining depends entirely on the power of yin and yang,\nAdvancing and retreating must rely on the authority of sun and moon.\nOnce this work is complete beyond the Three Isles,\nThey steadily ride simurghs and phoenixes to meet the immortals.\nReturning to the origin and restoring the primordial has reached Qian,\nAble to ascend and descend, they are called the Flying Immortals.\nThe arising of the first yang is the day to begin the work,\nNine revolutions complete the year of attaining the Dao.\nTo refine the elixir, seek the water within gold,\nTo establish the furnace, first set up Heaven within Earth.\nHere lies the principle of the returning elixir—\nWithout encountering an extraordinary person, vow not to transmit it.\nThe nine-and-five flying dragon has ascended to Heaven,\nIn due course, the power of the Red Emperor will follow.\nDelighted to meet the mercury pearl congealing at high noon,\nFortunate to encounter the lead mother forming the profound mystery.\nThe wild ape submits of itself—what need for refinement?\nThe untamed horse is tamed without the whip.\nOnce the single pill of Heaven’s elixir is refined,\nThe mind’s earth becomes forever firm and unyielding.\nWho in this world understands my family?\nMy family dwells in a glory apart.\nTheir overflowing chests store the Registers of Ascension,\nTheir rooms are filled with cinnabar refined by fire.\nThey drink the immortal wine of Heaven in great draughts,\nAnd constantly cultivate the undying flowers of the grotto.\nIf the mortal stream asks of my livelihood,\nEverywhere, multicolored clouds scatter in profusion.\nSaliva quenches thirst, qi serves as sustenance,\nTheir home lies in the Three Purities’ realm of the Jade Emperor.\nWhen refined in the golden crucible, the outer turns white,\nWhen cooked in the Jade Void, the inner becomes thoroughly yellow.\nOnly then do they know the Azure Emperor dwells in the Li Palace,\nOnly then do they trust that the golden essence is stored in the Water Mansion.\nThe common crowd seeks the wondrous principle,\nYet the *Cantong Qi* holds but a few lines.\nA purple edict descends with the simurgh from the Jade Capital,\nThe Primordial Lord summons them to the Three Purities.\nThey then partake of the cinnabar from the golden crucible,\nBrushing their cloud-embroidered robes as they ride the crane’s carriage.\nTwo celestial youths bear the jade pendants to guide them,\nFair maidens of the moon hold the sashes to welcome them.\nOnly after their work is complete and they have met the Perfected,\nDo they truly believe the immortal capital holds their names.\nCultivating, cultivating, until they reach Qian,\nThey are then called the Drunken Immortals among men.\nIn the world, time hurries the brief scenes of life,\nYet in the grotto, flowers and trees enjoy endless years.\nTheir form soars on sheer cliffs, no ordinary bones,\nTheir spirit dwells in the Mysterious Palace, a Heaven apart.\nI only wish the master would glance this way again,\nTo inquire beyond the profound into the even more profound.\nSitting alone with an empty mind, they turn the Yellow Court,\nNot following the times into profit and fame.\nTo preserve age, they hold only the true unified qi,\nTo cultivate life, they leave behind the hundred spirits.\nMorning by morning, they refine the fluid and return it to the Jade Mansion,\nNight by night, they face the origin to nurture the Jade Flower.\nDo not sigh that the old man finds joy in poverty,\nFor with ten years of work complete, they ascend to the Three Purities.\n\n**Parting from the Guest**\nMen receive qi and are endowed with yin and yang,\nTheir bodies equal Heaven and Earth, their lifespans long.\nThose who honor their origins can live forever,\nThose who slight their primal ancestors fall into oblivion.\nThe Three Palaces have their own method of reversing the flow,\nAll things possess their own means of operation.\nThe jade of Kunlun’s mountain, close at hand,\nHow many know it is the king of medicines?\n\n**Parting from the Guest**\nFew tread the path to the azure clouds,\nSpeak not of rise and fall—such matters never succeed.\nWhy is there no name on the golden tablet?\nIn the Jade Capital, there must be an immortal’s name.\nClouds return to the vast sea, dragons a thousand feet long,\nThe moon fills the long sky, a crane’s cry rings out.\nDeep gratitude to the enlightened sage-emperor of the Song,\nWho understood the vermilion edict and summoned the master.\n\n**Presented to Chen Chushang**\nThe net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide,\nYet one body comes alone to the Hua Mountains’ region.\nAfter the cold clouds depart, the waning moon remains,\nWhen spring snow arrives, it inquires of the Great Void.\nThe Six Grottoes’ Perfected return to the Purple Mansion,\nA thousand years of simurghs and cranes grow old in Cangwu.\nSince the master’s passing,\nIn all directions, few remain who are true men.\n\n**Lament for Master Chen**\nWho among the Daoists of Luofu shares his stream?\nClad in grass, eating bark, they scorn kings and lords.\nIn the world, the sexagenary cycle matters not to them,\nWithin their gourd, Heaven and Earth are free.\nCounting the moves of a half-finished game as the river moon dawns,\nA long whistle echoes through the autumn mountains and seas.\nAfter drinking, they turn their heads to speak of the return,\nPointing afar to the white clouds at the edge of the sky.\n\n**Presented to the Daoist of Luofu**\nA wanderer three thousand *li* from home,\nA cloud-and-water body for seven hundred years.\n\nWhen merit is complete, Penglai becomes a guest pavilion;\nWhen the Dao is perfected, tiles and rubble turn to gold.\nIn the sleeves for welcoming guests, wine is ever stored;\nWithin the alchemy furnace, another spring abides.\n\nVirtue amassed and masters sought—what lack to fear?\nSince ancient times, Heaven and Earth show no partiality.\nThis monk now appears.\n\nHeaven births one thing, transforming into the Three Powers;\nYin and yang interact, congealing the sacred embryo.\nDragon and tiger proceed in order, banishing yin ghosts;\nTortoise and serpent reverse their course, and the fire dragon arrives.\nThe Infant daily consumes the Yellow Dame’s marrow;\nThe Crone feasts on the White Jade Cup.\nWhen merit is complete, one naturally dwells beyond things;\nIn the human realm, cold and heat follow their cycles.\n\n*Record of Ancestor Lü, Scroll Four ends*\n*(Character \"相\" originally missing, supplemented from the* Daozang Jiyao *edition)*\n\n**Record of Ancestor Lü, Scroll Five**\n**Literary Records**\n**Sixty-One Seven-Character Regulated Verses**\n\nStars and constellations gather, departing the *Li* homeland;\nThe waxing and waning of sun and moon aid the Medicine King.\nFor three periods, fire refines the golden tripod’s treasure;\nWith five talismans, water cooks the jade pot’s broth.\nHeaven and Earth invert, the dragon gathers mist;\nAt *Mao* and *You*, the tiger devours and radiates light.\nEntering the chamber, seize the mechanism—\nA single cinnabar pellet transmutes the body into pure yang.\n\nBlood drips from the hairline, eyes like rings;\nBreath exhaled forms clouds, enraged at the world.\nHow to endure the myriad injustices?\nA single formula must sweep away the fierce and stubborn.\nWhere the flood dragon is slain, the deep sea churns;\nWhen the raging tiger is vanquished, distant mountains are uprooted.\nFor burying worldly passions and bearing righteousness,\nThe sword’s gleam is stained with bloody marks.\n\nSnow falls thickly as dusk descends;\nGolden goblets urge the strumming of the scorched paulownia.\nPoems recited at the feast, moments unmeasured;\nThe sword dances before the banquet, swift as the wind.\nWhy raise cups at midnight?\nSuddenly, eyes blaze with fury, and he soars into the void.\nWho among them lacks loyalty or filial piety?\nA head is seized and brought to the seat.\n\n**Two Poems Presented to the Sword Guest**\n\nA single golden pellet of elixir ensures longevity;\nTrue lead must be refined with *jia* and *geng*.\nFire draws the red phoenix’s marrow from the south;\nWater seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.\nThe tripod follows the four seasons, uniting at the center;\nThe medicine is dispatched through the three origins and eight trigrams.\nWith fasting and discipline, the nine transformations are achieved—\nSurely, upon entering the mouth, even ghosts and spirits are startled.\n\nDeep in the emerald pool, a true man resides,\nHis countenance like peach blossoms, his form like silver.\nThough his hair and beard remain unblemished, he possesses the art;\nHis rosy complexion never ages, for he communes with the divine.\nTo Penglai he must go—now is the time to depart;\nThe yellow robe on the rack transforms into clouds.\nThough mulberry fields may turn to vast seas,\nA single pill of common medicine secures a thousand springs.\n\nThe furnace nurtures cinnabar, temples unmarred by gray;\nBorrowing fame and profit, he dwells among men.\nHaving met a man of resolve who transmits the divine medicine,\nHe delights in kindred spirits, his smile ever bright.\nThe *Dao De Jing* of Laozi is entrusted to him;\nThe Purple Tenuity Star permits their shared ascent.\nFortunate to be gathered by a superior man,\nIn this world, he yields to none in leisure.\n\n**Presented to a Person**\n\nWho understands that long life is my planting?\nRefining true *qi* within the Three Terraces.\nKnowing full well the ascent to heaven in broad daylight,\nYet following the red dust back to the world.\nWhen the black tiger moves, rain and dew pour forth;\nWhere the red dragon plows, jasper and coral grow.\nSwallowing but one pellet of golden elixir,\nHe soars into the azure skies, never to return.\n\nAmid piled clouds stands the starry capital;\nOnly the bold recognize the hidden treasure.\nGreen wine lulls him to sleep through idle days and months;\nWhite duckweed stills the wind as he fishes rivers and lakes.\nEver aligning his bearing with the Dao of Heaven,\nHe does not waste words on worldly fools.\nThe mountain paths are distant, untrodden by men—\nHas anyone lately heard news of Lord Mao?\n\nCranes serve as chariots, wine as provisions,\nFor he yearns for the land of immortality, where none die.\nIf earth’s veins can be shortened,\nWhy not extend human years?\nStars and constellations often appear within the gourd;\nSun and moon are ever concealed in his sleeves.\nShould you wish for the common folk to meet him,\nHe never strays from the path of mercury.\n\nMagic mushrooms have no seed nor root,\nYet those who drink and consume them revive their souls.\nAs long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,\nLet the crow and hare race through Heaven and Earth.\nThe Infant clings only to the mother within yang;\nThe Crone must face the honored one atop her head.\nOnce attained, it remains for a thousand ages—\nNo tombs or graves are left for descendants.\n\nWho in this world comprehends these words?\nCease clinging to fame and profit in your heart.\nCasually downing cups of wine to the full,\nWhen inspired, chanting a hundred verses.\nBeyond the world, rosy clouds serve as companions;\nWithin the gourd, sun and moon are ever fair.\nWhen the time comes and merit is complete, where will he return?\nStraightaway driving a cloud chariot into the grotto-heavens.\n\nDisciples of the Mysterious Gate sit at the center;\nObtaining the tally, the wise and good move the Jade Emperor.\nBeneath the pillow, mountains and rivers harmonize with rain and dew;\nWithin the flute, sun and moon merge with Xiao and Xiang.\nThe *Kan* man meets the retiring *Jin* woman;\nThe *Li* woman ascends to wed the *Mu* youth.\nTruly, husband and wife together uphold their resolve,\nEstablishing teachings that entangle yin and yang.\n\nPointing afar to the high peak, he laughs aloud—\nRed rosy clouds and purple mists arise before him.\nOften in the dusty market, none recognize him;\nEver in the mountains, cranes welcome him.\nAt times, he plays with the jade toad to drive away ghosts and demons;\nAt night, he boils the golden tripod to cook jasper blossoms.\nWhen the time comes to journey to Penglai’s grotto,\nKnow that my immortal family bears a name.\n\n**Mocking the Worldly**\n\nHow laughable are those who ask of my home—\nA staff bearing clouds and things, trailing mist and rosy clouds.\nHis brows conceal lightning—no idle boast;\nHis hands plant golden lotuses—no vain pride.\nA scorched paulownia, three feet long, sustains his livelihood;\nA gourd of fine wine is his way of life.\nRiding a dragon, he roams far to the three isles;\nThrough long nights, none share his moonlit repast.\n\nBy the winding river’s bend, he sits and lies in contemplation;\nA single long path leads to the heavens’ edge.\nAuspicious clouds gather to attend the cinnabar palace;\nAuspicious vapors linger, rising as white smoke.\nLead and mercury now become the supreme medicine;\n*Kan* and *Li* today conjoin the divine elixir.\nIts power can preserve life, ensuring endless youth—\nIt lies within the human heart, not in difficulty.\n\nThe Mysterious Gate’s principles are ever more profound;\nThe root of immortality resides in mercury and lead.\nKnowing this as the true guardian,\nHarmonizing the Six and One also aligns with Heaven.\nOn Jade Capital Mountain, lambs frolic;\nIn the Golden Water River, stone tigers slumber.\nThe essential wonder can birth the awakened original body—\nWith diligent heart, all becomes naturally so.\n\nThough high officials may be noble, he does not respond;\nThose who speak of immortality are free to wander.\n\nTo seek the stone-liver, one meets the clam-sea;\nIn search of sweet snow, one crosses Yingzhou.\nMountains and rivers, drunk, are released within the gourd;\nSpirits and ghosts, at leisure, are gathered in the casket.\n\nNone before my eyes now recognize this truth—\nBetter to blend with the mundane over cups of wine.\nOnce I was invited to visit an immortal’s home,\nSuddenly ascending Kunlun to feast beneath the moon’s radiance.\nJade maidens guide the azure mist’s embrace;\nMountain lads carry white spiders of frost.\nFrom time to time, they pour thousand-year wine from the sea,\nOften plucking flowers of all seasons from the gourd.\n\nNow in the mortal realm, none know me—\nSoon I shall wave my sleeves and vanish into mist and clouds.\nThe fire-seed in the cinnabar field breeds gold of itself;\nLayer upon layer, pavilions grow ever clearer.\nTwo thousand deeds of merit manifest in a hundred days;\nA journey of ten thousand miles to Penglai takes but a day.\nTranscendence naturally leaves no ghostly record;\nIn the Jade Capital, immortals’ names endure forever.\n\nToday I attend the Jasper Pool assembly,\nWhere nine-tiered banners and sacred maidens welcome from the grotto.\nStudying Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*,\nThe heart’s earth becomes ever more lucid.\nThe yang dragon originally emerges from the *Li* palace;\nThe yin tiger returns to be born in the *Kan* position.\nWhen these two meet, they form the root of the Dao;\nTraversing the five directions, one gains the name of the elixir.\nIf cultivators of the true Dao know this,\nThey shall surely ride the red dragon to the Jade Clarity.\n\nFleeting life is insubstantial, easily scorned—\nIngesting and concealing it, one harbors bones of marvel.\nNot that one is unstained by the world’s dust,\nBut how else to transcend objects and commune with the formless?\nThough conversation falters, emotions stir;\nWhen walking alone, one moves lightly, effortlessly.\nA single grain of the knife’s measure births five hues,\nFlying cinnabar enters the grotto of immortals.\n\nDo not delight in chanting celestial poetry,\nFor few in the world can recite such rare verses.\nAccustomed to feasting on the Jade Emperor’s palace fare,\nOnce clad in Penglai’s grotto robes.\nHooves tread the sun’s wheel, red dew unfurls;\nPhoenixes bear the moon’s horns, azure clouds take flight.\nWhen shall I again rein the green-silk bridle,\nAnd brandish the golden whip to enter the Purple Tenuity?\n\nYellow sprouts and white snow rain golden flakes;\nWalking, I sing high; drunk, I chant low.\nSun and moon secretly uphold your chronicle;\nHeaven and earth naturally befriend me.\nSpirits vanish at the stroke of the Three Clarities’ sword;\nWind and rain soar as I play the zither.\nWhere shall I return after my southern journey?\nDo not let the crane depart to seek me in heaven.\n\nCloud-coiffed and bright-eyed, bones grow lighter—\nI say I sought the crane to reach Penglai and Yingzhou.\nDiscussing herbs all day, I know their flavors;\nAsked of immortals, I gain their name.\nAt night, jade dragons pierce the azure grotto;\nAt dawn, cold tigers slumber in the silver city.\nAgain I plan to cast my rod in spring’s waters,\nRecalling the Yellow Emperor’s voyage upon the sea.\n\nDragon essence and tortoise eyes harmonize;\nThe six-foot man can do naught against them.\nIn nine cups of water, the red child is refined;\nIn one furnace of fire, the yellow matron is nurtured.\nWhen the moon is full, one senses escape from heaven’s net;\nWhen merit is complete, one knows release from earth’s snare.\nHalf-drunk, I gladly swallow dragon and phoenix marrow—\nI urge you, no longer invoke Amitābha.\n\nForcing oneself to dwell here severs all kith;\nToo many wild scenes depart from the fitting verse.\nIf such poetry filled the mouths of ministers,\nEven emperors’ hearts would stir at the name.\nThe Daoist robe and creeping-vine sash hang idly;\nThe hidden cap and leather crown remain unadorned.\nBeyond this, there is nothing more—\nA gourd of village wine, a zither.\n\nWithin Huayang Mountain lie many fields of mushrooms;\nThe old man of Huayang Mountain further extends his years.\nBy the green-pine crag, he climbs the lofty trunk;\nAmid white-cloud drifts, he drinks the flying spring.\nNeither cold nor hot, the spirit drifts freely;\nFrom east to west, the qi flows endlessly.\nWhen three thousand deeds of merit are complete, it is time to depart—\nDo not speak of the grotto-heaven to the worldly.\n\nThe heart of heaven does not scatter, nor does the natural heart;\nSuccess and failure have ever been thus, from ancient times to now.\nKnowing the path, one should escape the world;\nLost in the way, one remains buried in obscurity.\nThe supreme medicine at one’s side awaits refinement;\nBeyond objects, cinnabar is yet to be sought in detail.\nThe immortal’s realm lies within the grotto chamber, close at hand—\nDo not let the waves of time drown your light.\n\nI secluded myself in the Mysterious Capital, forgetting the seasons;\nHow many times has the azure sea turned to dust?\nIn the Jade Capital’s hall, I paid homage to the Primordial Beginning;\nIn the Golden Gate’s palace, I bowed to the Venerable Lord.\nBored, I ride the thousand-year crane;\nAt leisure, I recline upon the ninefold clouds.\nHaving learned the art of eternal life,\nI dare not lightly transmit it to the world.\n\nNorth Star and Southern Dipper observed within the palm;\nThe workings of creation secretly transmitted.\nThe golden hammer resides in the sleeve, dwelling in the primal abode;\nThe jade gate and stellar palace descend from the Supreme Mystery.\nThough all the world seeks this Dao,\nWho among them attains the mysterious pass?\nThe Dao is luminously present—heed its message.\n\nAt the rapids of sun and moon, one departs and returns.\nThe sun’s shadow merges with the primordial, naturally so;\nThunder and lightning rush into the central plain.\nThe red horse is driven long into the eastern palace;\nThe vermilion gates swing wide, floating upon the azure spring.\n\nIn wrath, I pluck the primal chaos to sing of sacred transformation;\nIn joy, I accompany the solitary moon to celebrate the new year.\nOnly then do I know this is the source of all life,\nAttained by the benevolent before its transmission.\nSix dragons together herald ascent to Qian,\nAs one suddenly perceives the subtle workings of creation’s power.\nThe true Dao is often chanted beneath the pale autumn moon;\nIts ultimate words ever flow like jade-green waves.\n\nBy day, I ride a white crane to wander the Three Isles;\nBy night, I stand atop an ancient altar, crowned in gold.\nA single year yields the elixir of a thousand ages—\nWho among men would sully their sleeves with the dust of the world?\n\nAt the rapids of the Five Peaks, the scene is ever renewed;\nOnly the benevolent penetrate the formless, boundless self.\nThe celestial net turns, the Three Origins contend;\nEarth’s veins pulse, and the ten thousand things are born.\nOnce awakened to the Valley Spirit’s communion with this Dao,\nWho can govern their nature to cultivate the true?\n\nClearly expounded along the Central Yellow Path,\nAmidst thunder’s roar, one attains the divine.\nLonging to join the immortal singers and gain a lightened body,\nI soar past Penglai to the highest heavens.\nCrimson-crested cranes descend from beyond the clouds to greet me;\nPurple-scaled fish rise from the sea to welcome me.\nChang’e’s moon osmanthus blooms in full;\nThe Queen Mother’s immortal peaches gradually ripen.\nGazing down, the sun’s chariot nears dawn—\nSurely the mortal world has long attained longevity.\n\nThe four seas bustle, yet how few are at leisure?\nMen’s mouths speak only of worldly dust.\nKnowing you possess the Dao and have come to this mountain,\nWhy ask how one remains nameless in the world?\nTwelve towers of jade conceal secret formulas;\nWithin five thousand words lies the hidden pass.\nOnly then does one know the tripod holds the elixir of immortals—\nI beg but a single *daogui* to behold.\n\nSever the bonds of splendor, cast aside glory,\nFor from the first attainment, this is eternal life.\nOnce I shed my skin like a cicada by the brocade river;\nAgain, I changed my name upon Penglai.\nThrice dwelling, yet free from fortune or misfortune;\nA single speck of dust, yet bound to worldly sentiments.\nUnknowing of where merit’s fulfillment leads,\nI shall ride this dragon straight to the Jade Capital.\n\nIn those days, my worth filled the imperial capital;\nWith a carefree wave of my arm, I returned west—a true man.\nAlone, I possess ten thousand acres of white clouds;\nWho lacks even a single branch of cinnabar osmanthus?\nAt leisure, I seek the fisherman’s guidance by the Wei’s bends;\nDrunk, I ascend Lotus Peak, supported by a Daoist.\nOne day, I shall meet you again—\nBy bamboo streams and thatched huts, we’ll call to each other at night.\n\nThe golden hammer gleams as it dances upon the celestial steps;\nAlone, I ride the dragon, departing and returning.\nBeyond the heights, white clouds observe the sun’s cavern;\nAt ease, I slumber beneath the autumn moon, my arms outstretched to the sky.\nThe *li* flower, petal by petal, is born of heaven and earth;\nThe *kan* medicine, leaf by leaf, is nurtured by creation.\nDrunk at dusk by the Nine Forks, I turn to gaze—\nBeneath the Northern Star Mountain, bones gleam white.\n\nI forge bonds ever deep with the Dao’s essence,\nDaily following its ebb and flow.\nShould you wish to commune with the crane beyond the clouds,\nYou must diligently refine the gold within the water.\nWhen the elixir is complete, I fear heaven and earth too narrow;\nOnce ingested, what worry of illness or harm?\nThough I have not yet departed for the Jasper Terrace, I still mingle in the world—\nNo harm in a cup of wine to delight in idle song.\n\nGathering my zither and sword, I descend through misty vines—\nWhat fortune to pass this way today!\nMy appearance, though plain, remains tolerable;\nAcupuncture, alas, has little effect.\nI have read three thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures;\nI have mastered the twelve ancient arts.\nIf you doubt these minor Daoist arts,\nTry releasing your grip upon the golden steps.\n\nTipping back the cup of Huayang, I drink thrice more;\nRiding my dragon at dusk, I descend the southern crag.\nMy brows bristle as I strike my sword, leaving trails of starlight;\nMy robes, draped over clouds, gather emerald mist.\nThe golden liquid transforms into rain and dew;\nReturning to the Jade Capital, I age like pines and cedars.\nOnce, I used an iron mirror to illuminate spirits and ghosts—\nCrackling thunder searched the fiery depths of the pool.\n\nThe iron mirror smelts gold as flames fill the sky;\nIn the jade-green pool, the dragon rests beneath the setting sun.\nThe qilin’s intent harmonizes with heaven and earth;\nThe dew’s mechanism binds sun and moon.\nA three-foot sword lies across the banks of twin streams;\nA five-spiked crown adorns the lord of a hundred spirits.\nAt leisure, I don robes of feathers within an immortal’s grotto;\nAlone, I don golden lotus shoes to craft creation’s work.\n\nFollowing the karmic tide, I drift and sink at will,\nMy heart like water, like clouds—a single expanse.\nTwo scrolls of Daoist scripture, a three-foot sword,\nA flowering staff, a seven-stringed zither.\nThe elixir within my gourd, I bestow upon others;\nNew verses in my breast, I recite to guests.\nA single taste eternally adds a thousand years of life;\nA single grain of cinnabar transmutes a pound of gold.\n\nZither, sword, wine, and chess—dragon, crane, and tiger—\nCarefree and untethered, water without sorrow.\nAt leisure, I ride a white deer to wander the Three Isles;\nIn boredom, I drive a green ox to view the Ten Continents.\nFrom afar, I watch the bright moon rise over the emerald cave;\nHigh upon the green mountain, I hide amidst flowing clouds.\nShould men of this age desire the same,\nLet them abandon fame and profit, fleeting splendor.\n\nWithin the Purple Ultimate Palace, I know my own path—\nI personally whet my divine sword to pierce the returning *fei*.\nFirst, I dispatch the Jade Lad to open the southern hall;\nNext, I send the Azure Dragon into the Purple Tenuity.\nNine tripods of yellow sprouts nestle auspicious phoenixes;\nA single immortal’s frame nurtures sacred lingzhi.\nPenglai is no place for ordinary men—\nI fear only fools will leak the world’s secrets.\n\nTurning back, I finally emerge from the dust;\nCreation’s work lies solely in man.\nHad I earlier cast off the celestial dragon’s earthly net,\nHow would I know the White Tiger’s emergence from true nature?\nEndless is the path—who detains me?\nSilent and wordless, I naturally unite with the divine.\nStriking my sword in the deep of night, where do I return?\nClad in stars and moonlight, I cleave the qilin.\n\nSpring wanes, idly passing fallen blossoms;\nEach time I dance with my sword, I sigh.\nEver anxious that the white sun’s light and time are fleeting,\nEver resentful that the blue sky’s road is distant.\nMy original intent seeks neither fame nor profit;\nMy fundamental heart admires only water and mist.\nOf the world’s myriad floating and sinking affairs,\nWho among the enlightened can compare to my family?\n\nThe sun for harmony, the moon for cinnabar—\nThe lords of Hua and Xia behold with mortal eyes.\nBenevolence and righteousness differ as Hu and Yue;\nWorldly sentiments are as difficult as Tai and Heng.\nAfter refining the Eight Immortals, the bell’s spirit is wondrous;\nForged across the four seas, it chills the gall to fear.\nLaughing, I point out ten thousand injustices—\nRiding my dragon, wielding my sword, I guard the ninefold gates.\n\nSince parting, six eastern winds have blown over Luoyang;\nDrunken eyes, drowsy emotions—indolent and unyielding.\nShaking heaven and earth, my golden sword roars;\nSmelting sun and moon, the jade furnace glows red.\nMy staff sways over the three thousand kings of Chu’s domains;\nMy crane soars through the ten thousand layers of Qin’s mists.\nTo report to the immortal of Jin City:\nWe shall meet again in spring at Kuaiji Peak.\n\nBefore refining the returning elixir, first refine the heart;\nOnly when the elixir is complete does one perceive the Dao’s profound origin.\n\nEach leaves behind coins for wine and revelry—\nWho would believe you lack the elixir to transmute gold?\nWithin the grotto, wind and thunder return to your grasp;\nIn the gourd, sun and moon rest within your breast.\n\nThe work of immortals—how few can comprehend it—\nCultivating nature, prolonging life, one hums to oneself.\nAn iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden coins;\nA stone is carved, and youths string them into strands.\n\nA single grain of millet holds a hidden world;\nIn a two-sheng cauldron, mountains and rivers boil.\nThe white-haired elder’s brows trail to the ground;\nThe blue-eyed foreign boy points his hand to the sky.\nIf you grasp this mystery within the mystery,\nBeyond this mystery, no mystery remains.\n\nThe Winnowing Basket star and the Proud Host descend from the endless sky—\nHow could the mortal realm not stand in awe?\nThe dragon emerges from the water, its scales and armor complete;\nThe crane soars into the heavens, its feathers whole.\n\nAmid the dust, you teach a thousand eyes to see;\nYet in the world, few know the *Erya*’s refined verses.\nIt is but the ledger of fortune for the common folk—\nHow could such subtle wonders lightly be passed on?\n\nAt leisure, I swing my arms and enter the Gate of Heaven,\nBrushing my sleeves, I slowly gather the colored clouds.\nSilent, I look down upon the Yellow Valley’s child;\nWith a smile, I bow to the Purple Radiance Lord.\n\nI intend to ascend the Jade Palace and pay homage to the Metal Mother,\nThen visit Yingzhou to behold the solar wheel.\nJust then, Chang’e prepares a feast—\nThe jade nectar, newly brewed, steams with fragrance.\n\nOnce I followed Liu and Ruan, drunk in Peach Blossom Spring;\nUnconcerned with debts for wine in the mortal world.\nA hempen robe serves as collateral for now—\nWhen the sun returns from the nine heavens, it shall be repaid.\n\nPhoenix-down robes are not to be prized;\nEven fox-fur garments cannot compare.\nThis is the world’s priceless treasure—\nNo need to test it in the fire’s trial.\n\nRecalling past affairs, I sigh with pity:\nI once read the thirteenth scroll of the immortals’ scriptures.\nWhen Empress Wu died, she was but a maiden;\nWhen Chen Yu perished, he remained a youth.\nTwo wheels of sun and moon bear their burdens;\nNine mountains and rivers rest upon a single shoulder.\n\nBy day, no one speaks of such tidings—\nA gourd of spring wine leaves me drunk and content.\nWith sleeves hanging loose, I stride proudly above the world’s dust,\nMy gourd holding the fruits of many journeys.\nFame and profit, beyond the body, are not the Dao—\nBefore the Gate of Dragon and Tiger, discern the truth.\n\nAwakening from a dream, my soul visits the Court of Heat;\nFor years, my traces have hidden in the dust of the world.\nIn Huayin’s market, we meet again—\nNot the usual wandering peddler of medicines.\n\nTen thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, a three-foot zither—\nLiu An recognized me as a kindred spirit.\nAt my staff’s tip, a gourd of wine;\nIn my furnace, cinnabar transforms into countless grains of gold.\n\nBored, I sleep drunk at the crossroads;\nAt leisure, I fish in the heart of Dongting.\nWho among those we meet could recognize us?\nI fear that if we soar into the heavens, none could find us.\n\nOnce I battled Chiyou before the Jade Throne,\nSix dragons high in their chariot, phoenix bells ringing.\nBehind the Tathāgata’s carriage, I followed the golden drums;\nBeside the Yellow Emperor’s banner, I wore an iron crown.\n\nDrunk, I darkened the black beard of the Three Isles;\nEnraged, I drew my frost-edged sword, chilling the Ten Continents.\nAfter the age of the Xuanyuan’s dominion,\nI hid deep in the ravines, long sought but never found.\n\nMy horns and scales resound like a bell in the azure waves;\nMy face is like ice, my bones like pine.\nThe treasured sword in its scabbard often roars;\nThe golden hammer in my sleeve stirs the wind.\n\nWhen drinking, I am the life of the gathering;\nWhen reciting poems, I join in perfect harmony.\nNext year, I shall surely attend the Penglai assembly,\nRiding a fierce and multicolored dragon.\n\nImmortals enter the golden gates at dusk;\nThe gates of generals and ministers stand in the Jade Capital.\nYet if the grotto holds no fine sights,\nIt is for pity of the world’s living multitudes.\n\nMy heart’s zither harmonizes with the wandering crane;\nMy sword in its scabbard awaits the slaying of whales.\nBetween advance and retreat, neither path seems right—\nI rely on you to point the way forward.\n\nThe Nine Tripods boil a single grain of cinnabar,\nThe fire’s timing naturally unfurls the child’s flower.\nStars illuminate the blue lotus seeds;\nSun and moon conceal the white horse’s teeth.\n\nSeven returns refine the emerald dew;\nNine reversions bring forth the crimson mist.\nIf one seizes and consumes the Mystic Pearl,\nThe path to the Three Isles is not far.\n\n*Record of the Venerable Lü, Scroll Five* (ends)\n*Record of the Venerable Lü, Scroll Six* (begins)\n\n**Art and Literature

seek in vain forevermore.\nPity the tombs in desolate fields,\nWhere the dead of ages past knew no end.\n\n*(One version omits the last two lines.)*\n\nAmidst the splendor of fleeting

tiger.\nAttained between the brows, it first responds to the Mysterious Female.\nThunder’s startle, lightning’s vanishing—\nAll belong to the Yellow Canopy’s domain *(or: \"within\")*.\nGolden liquid, jade nectar—\nAll treasures of the Elixir Pool.\nLaozi’s art is wholly contained herein.\n\nAlas! Gold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can keep them.\n\n**Three-Character Poem**\n\nThis Dao is no ordinary Dao.\nThe root of life, the aperture of life and death.\nSpoken, it seems foul; practiced, it is wondrous.\nAll despise it, all bark at it.\nThe great key lies in inversion.\nDo not shun filth, do not calculate.\nOnce grasped, its effects appear at once.\nHeaven and Earth unite—*(the crow bears the omen)*.\nMouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.\nSwallow it into the belly, and you’ll know for yourself.\nThe sprouts of medicine are fresh, the sign of the primordial.\nExamine between the brows, follow the reverse path.\nThe essence of moisture nurtures, naturally continuing the line.\nWhen these two remain, only then is it sublime.\nTo practice it makes others cry out.\nQi must be firm, spirit must not dissipate.\nIf you do not practice, you’ll age in vain.\nRecognize the truth, and the old return to youth.\nThose who do not understand, do not speak of it.\nThis small method accords with the Great Dao.\nEssence, qi, and spirit are the elixir of immortality *(read as \"essential\")*.\nPreserved in stillness, repaid in clarity.\nRide the phoenix and simurgh, listen to Heaven’s music.\n\n**One Hundred-Character Chant on the Inner Elixir**\n\nNurture qi, forget words, and guard;\nSubdue the heart to act without acting.\nIn movement and stillness, know the ancestor—\nWith nothing to do, whom else would you seek?\nThe true constant must respond to things,\nYet in responding, avoid delusion.\nNot deluded, the nature abides;\nNature abiding, qi naturally returns.\nQi returning, the elixir forms itself;\nWithin the crucible, Kan and Li unite.\nYin and yang generate reversal,\nUniversal transformation—a single thunderclap.\nWhite clouds ascend to the crown,\nSweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.\nDrink the wine of longevity yourself—\nWho else could know this freedom?\nSit and listen to the stringless melody,\nUnderstand clearly the mechanism of creation.\nThese twenty lines in all\nAre indeed the ladder to heaven.\n\n**One Hundred-Character Chant on the Outer Elixir**\n\nLead and mercury dwell in the crucible,\nRefined into a priceless pearl.\nAll comes down to two words,\nResolving the writings of ten thousand households.\nUse lead yet do not use lead—\nWithout lead, mercury will not return.\nMaster the theft of black within lead,\nThen the cinnabar in stone is surely dead.\nThe great medicine has no head,\nThe golden elixir’s cauldron has no ears.\nNo need for other medicines—\nLead and mercury regulate each other.\nRegulating, they become husband and wife,\nNaturally achieving harmony.\nA hundred days of fire talismans,\nAnd the crucible contains heaven and earth.\nA year completes the great elixir,\nIts power then manifests in the world.\nThose who use lead are countless,\nBut how many value true lead?\n\n**Admonition to the World**\n\nA speck of goodness aids others.\nA speck of evil—refrain from committing it.\nClothing and food follow fate—\nBe content, and joy comes naturally.\nWhat does it matter what life is?\nWhy consult divination?\nDeceiving others brings misfortune;\nForgiving others brings blessing.\nThe eyes of heaven see clearly—\nRetribution comes swiftly.\nHeed my words,\nAnd gods and ghosts will submit.\n\n**Lyrics in Mixed Meter**\n\nFallen and destitute, fallen and destitute,\nSleeping in villages by night, wandering cities by day.\nAt leisure, I roam green mountains;\nWhen weary, I sell elixirs in the marketplace.\nThe money earned is not hoarded—\nI buy fine wine and pour it myself.\nDrunk, my chanting stirs gods and ghosts,\nCarefree as the sun sinks in the west.\n\n**Six-Character Poem**\n\nSpring warms, half the flowers bloom,\nI wander leisurely upon the rocks.\nAlone I carry the jade rhythm and elixir script,\nStrolling idly over green moss and emerald moss.\nSlept nine years in an ancient grotto,\nDrank flowing radiance by the thousand cups.\nWhen meeting others, speak not of other matters—\nPoint to the white clouds coming and going.\n\n**Four-Character Self-Narration**\n\nA Tang dynasty *jinshi*,\nToday an immortal.\nFeet treading purple mist,\nI return to the grotto-heaven.\nMoon bright, wind clear,\nA single iron flute sounds.\nLooking back at the mountains,\nNo trace remains across the four seas.\n\n**Two Couplets Inscribed at Jingfu Temple**\n\nDo not say immortals have no learning—\nFrom ancient times to now, how many have ascended?\n\n**Nine Songs**\n\n**Song of Enlightenment at Ezhou**\n\nA carefree wanderer across the skies,\nI chanced upon the Double Ninth in late autumn.\nDark clouds spread across the vast heavens,\nSweet rains nourished all things without end.\nMuddy roads kept me from leaving my door,\nWhen suddenly I heard a neighbor speak of elixir arts.\nI asked if he would transmit them—\nA single word of assent, and no difficulty remained.\nSeveral strange texts came into my hands,\nOne night I lit a lamp and read without cease.\nBy dawn, the sun was high, and I had finished—\nUnaware, I was drunk as if in a trance.\nIn that trance, I saw something appear,\nShaped like the sun, bright as a sudden sail.\nIt said it was the essence of cinnabar,\nFit to refine mortal substance in the crucible.\nMortal substance cannot transform into truth—\nTo transform truth, one must obtain the true within.\nNo need for bismuth, no need for mercury—\nThe returning elixir must be planted in the furnace.\nThe mystery within mystery is called true bismuth,\nYet when using bismuth, one does not use it.\nSometimes called dragon, sometimes tiger,\nSometimes infant boy, sometimes wondrous girl.\nA single name for cinnabar encompasses a thousand forms,\nYet within the one, there is one that is the elixir’s mother.\n\nDo not kindle fire, do not freeze water—\nRefine and temper with utmost care.\nWait until the tiger roars atop the shattered peak,\nWhen the black dragon seizes the dark pearl to play.\n\nThe dragon swallows the mysterious treasure and suddenly soars,\nBut the soaring dragon is caught by me to ride.\nWith a single breath, I ascend to return to the Azure Vault,\nWhere the Azure Vault stretches boundless, without east or west.\nNo dawn, no night, no years, no months,\nNo cold, no heat, no four seasons.\nOnly when cultivating to the realm of non-action\nDo I begin to sense the wondrous and the strange.\n\n*Knocking the Hexagrams Song*\nA drifting wanderer between Han’s end and Tang’s realm,\nThus the knocking of hexagrams remains unfathomable.\nUnrestrained in all directions, without barrier,\nStillness is non-action, movement is form.\n\nI drink wine, I eat meat,\nYet hold fast to rouge and powder, cutting off lust.\nI practice meditation, chanting verses of rouge and powder,\nUpholding precepts while wine and meat fill my belly.\nForm is medicine, wine is emolument—\nWithin wine and form, there is no constraint.\nOnly through flowers and wine was long life awakened,\nDrinking wine with flowers, even spirits and ghosts weep.\n\nDo not break precepts, do not transgress lust—\nBreaking precepts, true suchness sinks;\nTransgressing lust, the treasure of long life is lost.\nOnly those with Dao-power may attain it,\nAnd those with Dao-power are true free spirits.\nWine is a good friend, flowers a companion.\nIn the streets of flowers and willows, seek the true person—\nThe true person is found only in the flower-street meal.\nPluck flowers, wear them, drink the wine of long life,\nRevering non-action, the Dao naturally flourishes.\nLet the deluded masses bark and jeer—\nThe immortal flowers and immortal wine are the immortal land.\nArriving at this land, one is no ordinary guest,\nWhere wondrous girls and infant boys birth joy.\nWithin the cave, flowers of all seasons are ever plucked,\nEach flower knits the elixir of long life.\nThe elixir of long life is plucked from the flower’s heart,\nLayer upon layer of flower-medicine in radiant spring.\nYet people of this age do not grasp the principle within flowers—\nA single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\n\nGrateful to heaven and earth, moved by the empty void,\nI met an immortal master, my ancestral lineage.\nWhispering in my ear, the profound and wondrous intent,\nHe lifted me to Penglai’s first peak.\nThe first peak is an immortal thing,\nWhere only golden flowers bloom in trance.\nMouth to mouth, the transmission leaves no written trace,\nYet the numinous root is strengthened to the marrow and bone.\nStrengthening marrow and bone, refining the numinous root,\nPetal by petal, peach blossoms bring spring to the cave.\nIn seven sevens, white tigers are reared in pairs,\nIn eight eights, green dragons total one catty.\n\nTrue father and mother escort the original palace,\nWood-mother and metal-father, their natures inherently gentle.\nWithin the twelve palaces, the toad’s spirit appears,\nAs earthly souls descend and heavenly souls alight.\nLead first formed, mercury first born,\nJade crucible and golden tripod yet unheated.\nOne husband, one wife, mirroring heaven and earth,\nOne boy, one girl, uniting Qian and Kun.\nGeng must be born, Jia must be born—\nWhen Jia and Geng are born, the Dao begins to sprout.\nPlucking the root of heaven and the marrow of earth,\nWhite snow and yellow sprouts grow of themselves.\n\nLead also begets mercury, mercury also begets—\nMercury and lead are refined together in one place.\nThis refining is not of essence and fluid,\nBut the essence of heaven and earth, Qian and Kun, sun and moon.\nThe Yellow Dame matches them to perfect union,\nTransmitting the secret without error, mouth to mouth.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Two Origins rely entirely on mercury,\nThe Five Phases and Four Images how could they leave lead?\n\nLead begets mercury, mercury begets lead—\nSeizing the power of Qian and Kun’s creation.\nIn the profound and obscure, trance is born,\nFrom trance and obscurity, a mass is formed.\nNature must be empty, intent must be focused,\nLest the monkey-mind climb recklessly.\nWhen the flower-dew first opens, touch is strictly forbidden,\nSealed within the earthen crucible, do not add or remove.\nWithin the jade crucible, the civil fire refines,\nThrough the twelve hours, guard the One.\nAt this time, the Yellow Path unites yin and yang,\nThe three natures and original palace suffer no leakage.\n\nWhen qi moves, the true fire tempers—\nDo not let the dark pearl leave the precious hall.\nIncreasing the fire’s measure, guard against danger,\nFor the first nine, the hidden dragon must not be refined.\nThe subtle workings of fire and the knife’s edge transform,\nThe yellow sprouts of the great earth grow everywhere.\nWithin the Five Phases’ number, one yang is born,\nThe twenty-four qi arrayed like a banquet of pearls.\nWhen the fire is sufficient and the medicine complete,\nThe dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound.\nOf three leads, only one lead is achieved,\nThe golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to appear.\n\nReinstall the furnace, reestablish the tripod,\nRiding the tiger, mounting the dragon, departing the mortal realm.\nWhen the sun’s essence first appears and the moon’s radiance congeals,\nThe two eights unite in Ren and Bing.\nDragon-mercury binds, tiger-lead forms—\nPenglai is but a short journey away.\nKun-lead and Qian-mercury are the ancestors of the golden elixir,\nDragon-lead and tiger-mercury are most spiritually attuned.\nOnly when this principle is grasped is completion achieved,\nAs thirty thousand divine dragons guard the crystal.\nGuard the time, fix the day, clarify the talisman’s moment,\nDevote the heart solely to reverent intent.\n\nWhen black lead is refined and true essence purified,\nA single clash settles great peace.\nThe three chariots transport the pearl treasures,\nReturning to the precious treasury, naturally attaining numinosity.\nHeavenly spirits protect, earthly deities welcome,\nMerging Qian and Kun, the essence of sun and moon.\nWith a single roar, the tiger emerges from its den,\nPhoenixes dance and simurghs fly from the golden city.\nCinnabar paired with mercury in balance,\nA band of rosy clouds arrays before the Great Clarity.\nFrom the lead pool, golden light bursts forth,\nMercury-fire flows like pearls into the imperial capital.\n\nBeyond the union of dragon and tiger, hold fullness,\nAs the sagely walks and the numinous flies within the precious vase.\nWithin a single hour, the golden elixir is achieved,\nAscending to the golden gates as purple clouds arise.\nThe immortal peach ripens—pluck and consume it,\nAs the myriad transformations pay homage, heaven and earth rejoice.\nWith fasting and vigil, await the birth of one yang,\nThen advance the Zhou Heaven, fathoming the *Can Tong Qi*.\nFathoming the *Can Tong Qi*, refine the golden elixir,\nAs water and fire steam through the barrier gates.\nNurturing the embryo for two months, the divine elixir forms—\nHow could a man’s pregnancy be ordinary?\nThe inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir achieved,\nInner and outer join in harmonious union.\nForming a single pellet of purple-golden pill,\nTransforming and soaring through heaven and earth for eternity.\n\nThe elixir enters the belly, no common thing—\nYin is stripped away, transforming into pure yang.\nAscending and transcending as a guest of the Three Clarities,\nName fulfilled, merit accomplished, reaching the highest heavens.\nThe guest of the Three Clarities mounts a cloud-borne chariot,\nRiding the phoenix, soaring through the empyrean into the Great Void.\nSuch carefree joy and delight—\nRoaming the Three Realms, most pure and wondrous.\nAbove the Great Void, the cultivator of truth,\nBright and round, without a single thing.\nWithout a single thing, only the Dao is manifest,\nAs the true countenance of the perfected emerges from the five directions.\nImmortal boys and girls welcome with colored clouds,\nWithin the Palace of Five Lights, the true decree is transmitted.\n\nThe transmission of the true decree speaks of hidden truths,\nOnly through refining true lead and mercury’s essence.\nThe voices of enlightenment melt like ice,\nWhile heretical asuras shrink back in terror.\n\nTouching withered bones, they rise and take form—\nTrust in the Dao, and heaven’s ladder lies flat as your palm.\nNine generations of ancestors attain liberation,\nWho would envy the fleeting splendor of wealth and rank?\n\nSeek the resolute and the worthy,\nTo join in the crucible and transform the mortal frame.\nIf one clings to riches or hoards treasures,\nTen thousand immortals will refuse to come.\n\nThe cultivator of truth does not speak idly,\nFor each reckless word shortens heaven’s span.\nThrough countless kalpas like grains of sand, the Dao remains unachieved,\nAnd the seven apertures of the eyes burst with blood.\n\nThe poor and determined vow earnestly,\nTo lift all mortal streams to transcendence.\nTogether they ascend to the Penglai immortal assembly,\nWhere worldly suffering knows no end.\n\nIn this fleeting dust-bound life, reflect deeply—\nWithin the cavern’s realm, heaven and earth, sun and moon endure.\nWith steadfast resolve and苦心 for three or two years,\nA lifespan of ten thousand kalpas stretches boundless.\n\nAttaining the sacred Dao, the true and constant is revealed,\nTigers, rhinos, blades, and weapons can no longer harm.\nWater, fire, and dragons bring no injury,\nClapping hands in the celestial palace, they laugh with delight.\n\nSuch wondrous and subtle merits—\nYet who among men would truly seek them?\nFools cling to lust and wealth,\nThus immortals refuse to summon them.\n\nThe true and perfect Dao does not choose its vessel,\nNor does it favor high or low, rich or poor.\nEven princes and nobles must shed their splendor,\nAnd grind away their sharp edges.\n\nIf anger is not purged and desires remain unchanged,\nOne plunges into the wheel of rebirth, the sea of suffering.\nThough gold and jade pile like mountains,\nImmortals turn cold and indifferent.\n\nFame is not noble—only the Dao is supreme,\nPassed down through sages and worthies to their descendants.\nAdorned with gold, riding fine steeds,\nYet they vanish like dust in a crack of time.\n\nDust in a crack, a spark in stone—\nWhy fix the heart on such fleeting schemes?\nThrough ceaseless suffering, none can be called back,\nAs they scramble for profit and fame like a boiling cauldron.\n\nLike a boiling cauldron, they sink forever,\nLosing the Dao, deluded by illusion, bound by karma’s root.\nBut one who levels the thorns in the heart,\nI shall reveal the celestial mechanism to you.\n\nLife must be transmitted, nature must be awakened,\nEntering sagehood and transcending the mortal lies within your grasp.\nFew tread the path to the Three Clarities,\nWhile the gates of beasts teem with those who rush in.\n\nTurn away from worldly admiration,\nGuard well the mechanism of nature and life.\nIf even one is lacking, the blossom will not bloom,\nClinging to waves and foam, you will lose the way.\n\nTo cultivate nature without cultivating life—\nThis is the gravest error in practice.\nTo cultivate ancestral nature without refining the elixir,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.\n\nTo grasp life’s school but neglect ancestral nature,\nIs like a mirror without its precious reflective surface.\nThough one’s lifespan equals heaven and earth, they remain a fool,\nHolding wealth and power like a steward without true authority.\n\nTo cultivate both nature and life is profound and mysterious,\nSailing the great waves of the ocean’s depths in a dharma boat.\nSeizing the dragon’s head alive and whole,\nOnly then does one know the master craftsman’s skill is no empty boast.\n\n**Secret Song**\nSeek it, yet it cannot be seen;\nWhen it comes, it is no longer seen.\n\nUnseen, unseen—\nYour primal face remains unseen.\nIt once soared within fire,\nYet appears within water.\n\nThe path is not distant,\nNeither body nor mind clings—\nYet who knows the tortoise that returns yin,\nThe hawk that restores yang?\n\nWhen encountering, one meets the person;\nWhen attaining, one grasps the spirit.\nTwelve thousand cycles of sixty years—\nThis flask of flowing rosy dawn endures eternally.\n\nFlowing rosy dawn, flowing rosy dawn,\nAll belongs to the family of original nature.\nHungry, feast on the essence of the sun;\nThirsty, drink the radiance of the moon.\n\nIn the year of *jiazi* and *dingchou*,\nI shall shatter the great bulrush gate for you.\n\n**Song of the Great Elixir Directly Pointed**\nThe Three Pure Palaces hide atop Kunlun’s peak,\nSun and moon’s light floats, raising purple mist.\nPools and ponds brim, jade liquid churning;\nPavilions and terraces layer, circulating numinous springs.\n\nThe Green Dragon rides fire, mercury as its ore;\nThe White Tiger surges waves, mercury as its lead.\nTo obtain the Kan male, seek a mate;\nOne must rely on the Li female to forge the bond.\n\nThe Yellow Dame devises a thousand schemes,\nThe golden crucible opens into a single lotus bloom.\nThe Woman of Virtue holds the crow at the left,\nThe General wears the hare to guard the west.\n\nThe Black Tortoise crouches beneath the red furnace,\nThe Vermilion Bird perches before the radiant pavilion.\nThen, calming the spirit, one glimpses the reflection—\nAfter three cycles, the work is done, riding clouds to plow.\n\n**Song of the Valley Spirit**\nI have an abdomen, an empty valley’s void,\nSpeak of the Dao, it is and yet is not.\nSpeak of its non-being—it cannot be abandoned;\nSpeak of its being—it cannot be dwelled in.\n\nValley! Valley! Profound and wondrous,\nSpirit! Spirit! The true Great Dao.\nPreserve it, guard it, and gain the name of immortality;\nCultivate it, refine it, and earn the title of transcendent.\n\nThe spirit attains the One and becomes numinous,\nThe valley attains the One and becomes full.\nIf one can hold to the One,\nThis alone is longevity.\n\nLongevity is not far,\nYet apart from the body, it cannot be seen.\nIf the refining’s work is complete,\nNaturally, mortal bones transform.\n\nThe Valley Spirit never dies—this is the Mysterious Female’s gate,\nEntrance and exit, ceaseless, the Dao as if present.\nRefinement must occur at midnight’s *zi* hour,\nThe River Chariot bears the load to Kunlun’s peak.\n\nThe dragon chants, the tiger roars,\nWind and clouds converge as the Yellow Dame cries out.\nWithin the fire, the Crone holds her grace;\nTurning back, the Infant beneath the water charms.\n\nInfant and Crone meet the Yellow Dame,\nChild and mother reunite, their wills in harmony.\nTwelve gates of golden halls and jade chambers,\nThe Metal Elder and Wooden Mother now pass through.\n\nAfter the layered gates, the secure barrier locks,\nInspecting the Dipper and Ox, first apply the fire.\nAdvancing the fire to dissolve yin, the first yang emerges,\nThe thousand-year immortal peach first bears fruit.\n\nThe eastern shore of Qujiang binds the golden crow in flight,\nThe western shore’s pure palace gleams with the jade hare’s light.\nCrow and hare return to the peak’s summit,\nIn the furnace, the Maiden sheds her blue robe.\n\nShedding the blue robe reveals the pristine body,\nThe Infant leads her into the layered curtains.\nAfter ten months of deep affection, a boy is born,\nSaid to be ever-living, never dying.\n\nI urge you to refine, I urge you to cultivate—\nSeek the undying Valley Spirit here.\nHere, awaken to the subtle and profound,\nAnd with you, ascend in broad daylight to Yingzhou.\n\n**Song of the Brick**\nThe brick follows the rain’s erosion,\nYet it has never endured water and fire.\nIf it had passed through water and fire to become brick,\nIt would remain in the world for ten thousand years.\n\nIts edges firm and intact, never to decay,\nStruck, its resonant tone fit for carving.\nEven common water and fire achieve this,\nWhat among the myriad things can compare in durability?\n\nOn the path of cultivation, how many there are,\nWho exhaust years refining and nurturing, wasting spirit.\nUnaware they have never endured water and fire,\nImpermanence suddenly arrives at their door.\n\nFailing to awaken, never repenting,\nEven in death, they still borrow essence and marrow.\nUpholding the right thought is arduous,\nOne misstep, and the human form becomes another kind.\n\nHave you not seen the wealthy Zheng of Luoyang,\nWho spoke of the golden elixir as if deaf and blind?\nClinging to delusion, unaware of the truth of cultivation,\nHow could he know the hidden harmony of creation’s work?\n\nHave you not seen Zhang, the Prefect of Jiujiang,\nWho consumed medicine, lost his sight, and withered his spirit?\nNot knowing the Returning Elixir has no substance,\nHe recklessly ingested metals and stones—how foolish!\n\nHave you not seen Zhao, the Privy Councilor of Sanqu,\nWho studied Chan, became a ghost, and never understood?\nWhere lies the completion of the outer form?\nClever words and swift debates are ultimately unreal.\n\nThe brick follows the rain’s erosion,\nJust like these few in their cultivation.\nThe great man transcends awakened nature,\nExhausting the gates of emptiness without seeking verification.\n\nFu Xi transmitted the Dao to this day,\nExhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining life.\nTo fulfill life—what is the original source?\nFirst recognize Kan and Li, and the Four Directions.\n\nKan and Li are the true eternal home,\nThose who see this transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.\nKan is the tiger, Li is the dragon,\nThe two bodies originally dwell in one palace.\n\nDragon swallows, tiger devours, abiding within,\nSeparation and union, floating and sinking, beginning and end.\nStripping and returning, negating and affirming,\nAdvancing and retreating, coming and going, the union is certain.\n\nWaxing and full, waning and empty, they match in pairs,\nThe immortal deeply enters the crystal palace,\nDrinking fermented nectar, ever clearer and richer.\nAfter a thousand days of ingestion, the work is complete,\nGolden ribs and jade bones, the body already light.\n\nThis vision belongs only to oneself,\nAscending early to pay homage to the Three Pures.\nThe Three Pure Sacred Seats are also mine,\nOriginally, they only seize the essence of heaven and earth.\n\nDrinking common wine, eating rank and fishy foods,\nNourishing the original harmony, ever more abundant.\nNaturally fusing and congealing, turning luminous,\nTransforming into pearls, flying to the Jade Capital.\nIn an instant, six years without hunger,\nBlood transmutes into white cream, the body indestructible.\n\nNot eating is the true fasting,\nTrue qi steams and strengthens the limbs.\nHaving ceased eating, surpassing a hundred eons,\nMouth and nose no longer breathe common breath.\nThe true person breathes through the heels, the common through the throat,\nFrom this, true and common stand on either side.\n\nThus, one attains the leakless body,\nFetal breathing in the cinnabar field stirs true fire.\nLaozi henceforth is called the Infant,\nThe fire’s regimen spans nine years.\n\nPreserving form to dwell in the world, unaware of spring,\nSuddenly, the Heavenly Gate opens atop the crown.\nThe true person emerges with great spiritual powers,\nFrom this, celestial immortals may offer congratulations.\n\nThe sages of the Three Teachings share one gate,\nThe deluded labor in vain—why exhaust yourselves?\nThose with insight cherish life,\nThe embodied never truly perish.\n\nAlas for the foolish, who vainly mount empty discourse,\nDrifting without rule or end, trapped in cycles—when will they break free?\nStudents, students, search carefully,\nAnd you must delve into the ancient gold and jade.\n\nGold and jade intermingle without reckoning years,\nWondrous within wondrous, mysterious within mysterious.\nEncouraging Niu Sheng and Xiahou Ge, the two scholars:\nTwo scholars—yet not scholars,\nNot scholars, but immortals in the making.\n\nWithin the land of China, they met in person,\nGazing heavenward, their eyes alight with laughter.\nOnce more, turning back.\n\nCrane-like in form, tortoise-like in bones,\nDragon’s chant, tiger’s visage.\nI have utmost words to exhort you,\nWould that you, sir, neither doubt nor guess.\n\nSimply bask in the sun, breathe the wind,\nSwallow rain, exhale thunder,\nFire lodged in the hidden palace, water aiding the cinnabar terrace.\nMetal and wood exchange, earth returns to its place,\nLead and mercury part, revealing the embryo.\n\nRed blood transforms, white milk flows,\nLight penetrates the apertures, stirring the hundred bones.\nNow coiled, now unfurled,\nAt the sound of laughter—ha ha!—the child gasps yet does not die.\n\nThe belly empty, fasting evermore,\nRepaying fame and profit with wild song and drunken dance,\nRepaying wealth and honor with hempen sandals and plain straw shoes,\nAsking the year’s cycle—why keep count?\n\nSee the mulberry fields turn to yellow dust,\nGreen mountains and white clouds make a fine abode.\nI urge you: go home, go home.\n\nTo Hermit Liu of White Dragon Cave:\nJade flees, gold flies—both luminaries rush,\nFirst blooms the flower, then comes autumn frost.\nVainly boast of a thousand years of wealth and longevity,\nYet it is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.\n\nHow swift that lightning flash!\nA hundred years amount to but thirty thousand days.\nWithin them, cold and heat alternately torment,\nUnaware, the youthful face fades in darkness.\n\nThough children and grandchildren fill your sight,\nAffection and love only entangle further.\nWhen essence is exhausted and the body withers,\nWho can teach them to briefly preserve their countenance?\n\nWith no means to extend life,\nOne must surrender the body to flowing waters.\nLook upon the sages of old—\nHow many knew how to remain in the world?\n\nYet there is a way to remain in the world,\nOnly because men of this age mismeasure.\nThey scramble to the mountains in search of herbs,\nRefining lead, controlling mercury, concocting cinnabar.\n\nConcocting cinnabar is no trifling matter—\nOne must seek crimson blood within the Kan trigram,\nTake it to the Li position to temper yin essence,\nHarmonizing and blending at the proper time.\n\nThe proper time requires a matchmaker:\nThe Gold Elder and the Maiden wed.\nThe Gold Elder loves to ride the White Tiger,\nThe Maiden ever mounts the Crimson Dragon.\n\nThe tiger sits quietly by the autumn river,\nThe dragon stirs its body in the deep pool.\nThe two beasts meet in battle,\nWaves surging like a boiling cauldron.\n\nThe Yellow Matriarch and Ding Lao lend their might,\nShaking the gods and spirits of heaven and earth.\nIn an instant, the battle ends, clouds disperse,\nPlanting a mysterious pearl in the mud’s depths.\n\nFrom this, roots and sprouts gradually grow,\nTended with timely irrigation, embracing true essence.\nAfter ten months, the embryo is shed, swallowed into the mouth,\nSuddenly, the mortal body is imbued with spirit.\n\nThis matter is rare in the world,\nNot known to ordinary men.\nIf in past lives you lacked immortal bones,\nHow could you easily encounter it?\n\nThe Golden Elixir should be refined at once,\nFor time flies swift as an arrow.\nTo catch fish, one must weave a net—\nWhy not still the heart and refine lead?\n\nLest the candle be snuffed out by the wind,\nThe six paths of rebirth make heaven hard to reach.\nLately, men of the world are full of deceit,\nAll donning plain robes to call themselves Daoists.\n\nAsk them what metal and wood are—\nThey fall silent, mute as the afflicted.\nYet they claim to practice qi absorption and fasting,\nClaiming other paths and distant roads.\n\nHave they not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by Lord Yin,\nWhere the Taiyi’s ear-containment method is strongest?\nDo not fault my words for being too wild or coarse,\nOnly because men of this age are hard to discern.\n\nOnly when your heart aligns with mine\nDare I pour out my heart to you.\n\nInscribed on the Gate of Master Huang’s Hermitage on Tongwu Mountain:\nI possess words most mysterious within the mysterious,\nWandering the eight directions, nowhere to speak—\nLike drifting clouds, they float to Ningsun,\nWhere I meet you, sir, in the profound.\n\nI know you are a solitary cloud’s traveler,\nAbout to speak of the subtle and formless,\nThe root source of the great Dao.\n\nI urge you to seek the truth within—\nThere is one, divided into three and five,\nOriginally nameless—cold spring’s trickling,\nQi flowing ceaselessly,\nRising through Kunlun, returning to purple float.\n\nSinking and rising, entering the central palace,\nThe four images and five phases all manifest,\nGreen Dragon seizes the White Tiger,\nAuspicious winds rise, sweet dew descends,\nLead congeals true mercury, cinnabar forms,\nA single wheel of fire reigns supreme.\n\nHaving cultivated the true, be steadfast,\nAble to turn heaven and earth, float mountains and seas.\nMoving through heaven and earth, none can know,\nTransforming ghosts and spirits, none perceive.\n\nAfter a thousand mornings, the purple-gold body is forged,\nThereupon the spirit is perfected, returning to simplicity.\n\nHuang, scholar Huang,\nHaving cultivated the true, do so early.\nAmong men, when will worldly affairs end?\n\nGreed for fame, greed for profit, love of gold’s abundance—\nFor their sake, the body ages and withers.\nNow I urge you with sorrowful heart,\nConsider, sir, the vigor of life.\n\nLest the great limit arrive at your body,\nAnd you drift once more into birth and extinction.\n\nI leave these words to express my intent.\nWhen next we meet,\nI shall surely press you further.\nDo not waver from your initial resolve,\nCherish well, cherish well.\n\nEighteen Fisherman’s Songs:\nEntering samadhi.\n\nClose your eyes to conceal the true, your spirit’s thoughts congeal,\nIn the boundless dark, behold your origin.\nVast and dim, indistinct,\nThe mysterious vision arises—all is emptiness.\n\n**First Nine:**\nThe Great Dao has ever belonged to nature,\nIn an empty hall, sit in stillness, guarding the mechanism.\nThe Three Fields’ treasure,\nEver preserved,\nThe Red Emperor sits clearly in the vast cold.\n\n**Mysterious Workings:**\nSun and moon intertwine, racing day and night,\nAt Kunlun’s summit, the cosmos is fixed.\nWithin the true mirror,\nTruly worth discussing,\nThe crimson dawn’s glow quietly inquires.\n\n**Spirit’s Efficacy:**\nIn vagueness, seize it—it comes naturally,\nStealing creation’s work within the divine crucible.\nFire refines,\nPassing through yin and yang,\nTo congeal the elixir.\n\n**Bathing:**\nAt the gates of Mao and You, the time of action,\nThe Red Dragon dips into the jade-clear clouds, thin as mist,\nRain falls lightly,\nRevealing the demon’s form, skin like snow.\n\n**Prolonging Life:**\nAt Zi and Wu, constantly feast on the essence of sun and moon,\nThe gate of the mysterious pass opens and remains so—\nLive thus your whole life,\nCarefully refining yin and yang.\n\n**Auspicious Crucible:**\nConvergence arises from the house of Wu and Ji,\nNo need for gold and mercury—\nThis alone forms the cinnabar,\nAs yin and yang reverse, its hue transforms.\n\n**Attaining Life:**\nStanding in the Three Powers, belonging to the Five Phases,\nWhere yin and yang unite, dragons soar,\nTigers rage,\nSpitting forth a divine pearl, each contends.\n\n**Brilliance:**\nThe Four Symbols distinct, the Eight Trigrams complete,\nAt their intersection,\nMore delicate and shy,\nHeaven and Earth, male and female—\nTheir entwining reveals deep passion, the jade body softens.\n\n**Refining the Substance:**\nReturning to the origin, seek it here,\nCirculating through the golden crucible, tiger and dragon roar.\nThe body does not age,\nWorldly defilements cannot invade,\nThe face reverts to youth, the bones turn to gold.\n\n**Divine Marvel:**\nReturning to the initial state, transformed into a youth,\nWhere the auspicious lotus blooms, its color radiant red.\nWithin the golden crucible,\nVast and dim,\nExchanging bones, adding sinews—everywhere open.\n\n**Knowing the Path:**\nWhich immortal scripture describes this method?\nThe *Cantong Qi* and the *Great Change* reveal yin and yang.\nYou must master it,\nDo not act recklessly,\nThose who succeed gain renown, the Dao naturally flourishes.\n\n**Facing the Emperor:**\nNine cycles complete, the count is exhausted,\nOpen the furnace, lift the crucible—behold the golden elixir.\nFeasting done,\nDepart the mortal realm,\nTread upon blue clouds, ascend to heaven.\n\n**Aligning with Principle:**\nAll the world’s people—on what do they rely?\nIf not seeking within, whom else would you seek?\nCut off desires,\nSever greed and delusion,\nDo not deceive the spirit in darkness.\n\n**Free from Care:**\nTo study the Dao, begin here,\nSever attachment and love, part from delicate softness.\nEver guard stillness,\nDwell in deep seclusion,\nFeast on qi, drink the dawn’s glow—sated, then rest.\n\n**What Use?**\nGreed for wealth, greed for glory, chasing profit and fame,\nWandering drunk, clinging to fear and passion.\nIf you do not seek,\nThe years will startle you,\nWhen this body ends, where will you be born?\n\n**Swift as Lightning:**\nThrough ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, to gain a human form—\nYou must know the causes planted in past lives.\nHasten to awaken,\nEscape the sea of delusion,\nLest you suffer the bitterness of samsara.\n\n**Ever at Ease:**\nClose your eyes to seek the true—the true returns of itself,\nA single luminous pearl shines brightly.\nAll day long,\nDo not cast it aside,\nLest the King of Hell dispatch messengers to pursue you.\n\n---\n\n**Eleven *Dream of Jiangnan* Songs**\n\n**Huainan’s Method:**\nHuainan’s method, Huainan’s method,\nAutumn stone is most worthy of praise.\nIts position aligns with heaven and earth, adorned with white dew,\nIts form shifts in Yin and Mao, bearing the river chariot,\nAt Zi and Wu, it congeals the morning glow.\n\n**Wang Yang’s Art:**\nWang Yang’s art, Wang Yang’s art,\nThe secret lies in the yellow sprout.\nThe first of myriad medicines resembles this,\nTuned to the Yellow Bell, it returns home,\nIn the tenth month, you may surely boast.\n\n**The Yellow Emperor’s Guard:**\nThe Yellow Emperor’s guard, the Yellow Emperor’s art,\nMysteriously wondrous, the golden flower.\nThe jade liquid first congeals, the red powder appears,\nHeaven and Earth’s covering and bearing secretly intertwine,\nDragon and tiger transform into cinnabar.\n\n**The Art of Longevity:**\nThe art of longevity, the art of longevity,\nThe mysterious essentials mend the mud pill.\nPeng Zu attained it, living eight hundred years,\nYet people harm themselves thereby—\nWho truly knows the yin elixir?\n\n**The Yin Elixir’s Secret:**\nThe yin elixir’s secret, the yin elixir’s secret,\nThe three and five unite in the mysterious diagram.\nThe two and eight respond to the mechanism, fit for gathering and moving,\nThe jade and the moon turn back—the hare’s glory withers,\nThe countenance surpasses that of mortal sisters.\n\n**The Art of Longevity:**\nThe art of longevity, the art of longevity,\nThe first nine conceal the hidden dragon.\nBeware of ascending too high—best to be a guest,\nQi flows through the cinnabar field, communicating,\nThe aged revert to infants.\n\n**The Cultivator of the Body:**\nCultivator of the body, cultivator of the body,\nDo not err and enter the sea of delusion.\nThe qi guards the golden elixir, transmitted in the world,\nResembling heaven, resembling earth, resembling the human body—\nNo need to ask neighbors.\n\n**The Returning Elixir’s Secret:**\nThe returning elixir’s secret, the returning elixir’s secret,\nNine nines are most profound.\nThe three sacrificial animals are originally one within the body,\nTo refine the divine medicine, urgently seek lead—\nFinding it, you are an immortal.\n\n**The Elixir of Longevity:**\nThe elixir of longevity, the elixir of longevity,\nNo need to ask others.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces—observe them in your palm,\nThe Five Phases and Four Symbols reside within the body—\nUnderstanding, you naturally attain the divine.\n\n**The Student of the Dao:**\nStudent of the Dao, student of the Dao,\nCultivate and nourish—do not delay.\nLight and shadow in an instant, like a dream,\nA grain of the returning elixir transforms into golden form—\nWhen you die, do not return.\n\n**The Manager of Life:**\nManager of life, manager of life,\nExamine closely, heed subtle words.\nA hundred years in a dream pass in an instant—\nI urge you to refine and preserve your honored years,\nSoon you will be an immortal.\n\n---\n\n**Four *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**\n\nYesterday in Nanjing, today on Heaven’s Peak,\nSwift as a flash, fleeting as a spark.\nPoint to Dongting as wine—\nWhen thirsty, drink deeply.\nJun Mountain as a pillow—\nWhen drunk, sleep soundly.\nLaughing and chatting freely,\nComing and going without hindrance,\nHalf mad, half immortal.\nAlways with me,\nA heart full of wind and moon,\nSleeves carrying clouds and rain.\n\nPeople ask of my years of wandering—\nAgain I prepare the second feast of Shu’s splendor.\nBreak the coral, plant my jade tree,\nDrain the Milky Way, sow my golden lotus.\nShatter the Jade Capital,\nOverturn Penglai Isle.\nBowing before the Jade Emperor’s empty throne,\nNo difficulty remains.\nTruly, with eight hundred merits complete,\nThree thousand deeds fulfilled.\n\n**Second of the *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**\n\nThe burning house entangles,\nNight departs, dawn arrives—\nEndless toil, yet today knows not tomorrow’s fate.\nWave upon wave, kalpa upon kalpa,\nWhat reason is there?\nThis world’s windblown lamp,\nDew on the grass—\nI see it and weep.\nNothing endures:\nLike fire bursting from stone,\nFoam floating on water.\n\nEnough! Turn back early,\nStrike through past frivolities with a single stroke.\nLet coarse cloth and plain rice suffice,\nPassing days in verdant ease.\nLet others mock me—\nWhat more do I seek?\nWhen the final limit comes,\nRich or poor matter not.\nWhy fret day and night in vain?\nI urge the young: abandon worldly ties,\nCome wander the seas.\n\n---\n\n**Third of the *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**\n\nPoems, songs, essays—\nThough you leave behind\nTens of thousands of verses,\nDays pass one by one,\nMonths push forward month by month.\nThis year unfinished,\nNext year awaits.\nTime is finite,\nThe burning house boundless—\nI fear the worthy will grow old in delay.\nGreedy fools\nHope to build a family *and* cultivate the Dao,\nTwo things at once.\n\nFools cling to dust,\nWho believes heaven lies within the gourd?\nThis Dao has no #14 attachments,\nNeither drawn to wealth\nNor distant from poverty—\nOnly a steadfast heart matters.\nNo need for exhausting effort,\nNo need for harsh austerities.\nStill the mind, forget scheming,\nMerge with nature.\nThe matter of long life\nAwaits the wise one’s release—\nOnly then may it be passed on.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth of the *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**\n\nThe sevenfold-returned elixir:\nFirst refine the self, then await the hour.\nWhen the first yang stirs in midnight’s long silence,\nThe gentle lead cauldron\nGlows through the bamboo screen.\nCreation races,\nTiger and dragon entwine,\nThe work of stoking the fire presses on.\nYet the *Wei* constellation’s *Niu* and *Dou* are lacking—\nThe *Jade Toad’s* secret says the mystery lies in *Wei* and *Ji*,\nFor the woman’s position marks the first yang’s stir.\nSome write \"still hear danger\"—this may not be so.\n\nBy Qujiang’s banks,\nWatch the moon’s radiance gleam—\nA crow takes flight.\nWho then would believe\nThe child is nurtured from nothing?\nDistinguish the water’s source, clear or muddy,\nThe separation of wood and metal.\nWithout a master’s guidance,\nThis truth is hard to know.\nThe Dao is subtle,\nHeaven’s mechanism profound.\nTo begin practice is already too late.\nThe road to Penglai—\nWait until three thousand deeds are complete,\nThen walk alone through the clouds.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Miscellaneous Songs**\n\n**Ten Miscellaneous Songs**\n\n---\n\nTo Lord Zhongli, chief of the perfected hosts,\nI bow my head in reverence.\nBefore heaven and earth arose, the Dao was;\nAfter heaven and earth took form, the body followed.\nHe overturns the cosmos,\nTraverses the universe unbound.\nThe Tang immortal Lü received his secret transmission—\nAh! Wandering the jade-green vaults of Penglai,\nHis spirit remains unchanged through ten thousand ages.\nWhere has he gone?\nTo the breezy isles of Yingzhou in the waves.\nWhere has he come from?\nFrom Tiantai, after a meal of sesame.\nHmph!\nSince the Second Patriarch expounded the mystery,\nA thousand golden lotuses have bloomed upon the sea.\nMind empty, Dao too is empty;\nWind stills, the forest returns to calm.\nWhen all floating clouds are rolled away,\nThe moon shines bright of itself—\nMountains and rivers cast their shadows.\nIn offerings and cultivation,\nOld words become fresh reflection.\nWhen beans burst in the fire like lotuses,\nThe cold ashes are painfully stirred to life.\n\n*This concludes the divination by milfoil.*\n\nAt the meeting of Kan and Li, Kun and Dui at midnight,\nOne must recognize one’s own root and origin.\nThe thunder shakes the mountain’s peak—\nRain washes the earth to bring forth the yellow sprout.\nSeize the golden essence and lock it fast,\nRefine jia and geng to birth dragon and tiger.\nWhen he asks who transmitted this to you,\nSimply say: “The master surnamed Lü.”\nThere was once a prefect fond of the Dao,\nWho ordered his courtesans to sing songs of the Dao’s essence.\nUnable to comply, they summoned a fangshi to compose them.\nA Daoist passed by, demanded wine, and inscribed verses on the wall before departing.\nThe next day, the courtesans sang them at the prefect’s feast.\nStartled, he inquired after the Daoist,\nBut the man had vanished—\nOnly then did he realize it was Lord Lü.\nThe courtesan, too, was freed from her bondage.\n\n*This concludes \"Pacing the Toad Palace.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s profound source,\nThe hidden secrets of the lofty perfected—\nHow could their elegance be known or heard?\nThe primordial qi,\nClear and turbid naturally divided,\nYet who, not knowing Kan and Li’s inversion,\nCould discern the floating and sinking of metal and wood?\nIn the subtle depths,\nSomething arises from nothing—\nBy the ravine, tiger and dragon roar.\nWithin the gourd, true transformation:\nThe essence of heaven, the marrow of earth,\nYin’s po and yang’s hun.\nCirculating the water and fire of the celestial sphere,\nHarmonizing cold and warmth,\nAfter ten months the elixir is complete—\nAll else is but side doors.\nDo you know?\nIn this dusty world, few walk the narrow path.\nTruly, there are few who understand.\n\n*This concludes \"Court Full of Fragrance.\"*\n\nWith the bearing of an immortal,\nHe overturns and moves the cosmos.\nAt the appointed hour,\nMetal and wood meet at Kan and Li’s positions.\nA single grain of the elixir congeals—\nThe water tiger hides its form,\nThe fire dragon subdues its body.\nA ten-thousand-zhang radiance blazes,\nImmortal blossoms bloom,\nSacred youths and numinous maidens pluck them.\nOn this mid-autumn night in the celestial vault,\nThe silver toad rises from the sea,\nWaves churning like a thousand layers of snow.\nThis is the pivot of heaven and earth—\nWho can fathom its waxing and waning?\nA moment’s work,\nIn an instant the elixir gathers—\nBy what method is this achieved?\nLeaning against the sky, he lets out a long whistle,\nAnd the cave is filled with boundless wind and moon.\n\n*This concludes \"Intoxicated by the River Moon.\"*\n\nThe path to long life lies before your eyes,\nYet how many fools fail to awaken?\nThe river of desire surges wide,\nWaves and winds rage—\nThe elixir boat is hard to cross.\nBut heed the immortal master’s words:\nTo reach the other shore requires but a single phrase.\nRefine the golden elixir, exchange your mortal bones for purity,\nAnd spare yourself the suffering of the three realms.\nWith all affairs settled in a tranquil heart,\nGather true yang into one place.\nClearly recognize the true essence of the numinous light,\nYour original face.\nThis subtle principle—\nDo not lightly entrust it to just anyone.\nKnow that Penglai has its immortal companions,\nWith whom you shall clasp hands\nAnd ascend to heaven together.\n\n*This concludes \"Water Dragon Chant.\"*\n\nI have a three-rafter hut,\nDwelling by the numinous spring.\nIts four walls stand bare, untroubled by emptiness.\nThe forest of ten thousand images forms its beams and brackets,\nIts roof tiles the blue sky—\nLeak-proof for many years.\nWhen the tally of deeds reaches three thousand,\nThe green cause is complete.\nTaming the fire dragon, subduing the tiger,\nI become an immortal upon the earth.\n\n*This concludes \"Waves Scouring Sand.\"*\n\nHeaven is not high, earth is not vast—\nOnly the true heart\nEmbraces all things within.\nThe undiminished whole resides in non-use;\nWhen used, it is plucked at will,\nEncompassing the ten thousand images and the dusty realms.\nWithin the void, amid the colored world,\nAll is the returning elixir,\nEach clearly fit for gathering.\nThis crucible and furnace—do you understand or not?\nNurture the numinous crow\nTo soar from the sea of radiance.\n\n*This concludes \"Sūmùzhē.\"*\n\nFor three hundred years,\nMerits inscribed in the annals of history—\nYet how much has crumbled into dust?\nAwakening from the millet dream,\nI abandon Confucian affairs,\nWeary of the world, I conceal myself.\nI trade my branch of cinnamon\nFor a thousand years of youth.\nAt Yueyang Tower,\nWith silk kerchief and feather fan,\nWho recognizes the celestial being?\nI long to ascend to Penglai,\nTo join the immortal assembly.\nFrom afar, I see the jade halls where pipes play,\nPhoenixes dance, simurghs whirl,\nWind-drawn chariots, cloud-borne plows—\nThe peach of immortality and purple beams never fade.\nI wish to encounter a single grain,\nWrapped in ninefold rosy glow,\nAnd follow in the footsteps of the perfected.\n\n*This concludes \"Rain Amid Flowers: Inscribed at Yueyang Tower.\"*\n\nThe west wind blows on the Wei River,\nFallen leaves fill Chang’an.\nAmid the boundless mortal world,\nI alone remain at ease.\nThe natural crucible and furnace,\nTiger coiled, dragon entwined.\nThe ninefold-transmuted cinnabar complete,\nA single grain of the knife’s measure—\nThus one becomes an immortal upon the earth.\nLet others embrace wealth and noble carriages;\nWhen all is said and done, it is but vanity.\nThe millet still uncooked,\nThe dream shatters.\nIn the sea of right and wrong,\nOne can scarcely stand firm.\nI shake my sleeves and depart for Jiangnan,\nWhere white duckweed and red reeds drift,\nTo wander once more by the misty shores of Mount Lu.\n\n*This concludes \"Urgent Beats on a Path of Flowers: Inscribed at the Osmanthus Pavilion in Chang’an’s Wine Tower.\"*\n\n*Thus concludes Volume Six of The Records of Patriarch Lü.*",

Some accounts place his birth in Puban, others in Hedong. His great-grandfather, Lü Yanzhi, served as Military Commissioner of Zhedong; his grandfather, Lü Wei, as Vice Minister of Rites; and his father, Lü Rang, as Prefect of Haizhou.\n\nHe was born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the fourteenth year of the Zhenyuan reign (at the *si* hour). As his mother lay in childbed, a rare fragrance filled the chamber, celestial music drifted through the air, and a white crane descended from the heavens, entering the bed-curtains before vanishing. At birth, his form was golden, his essence wooden—possessing the bones of a Daoist immortal and the bearing of a transcendent. His head resembled a crane’s, his back a tortoise’s; his body was that of a tiger, his jaws those of a dragon. His brows were layered like green ridges, his phoenix eyes angled toward his temples. His neck was long, his forehead broad, his face round, his nose straight and prominent. His complexion was yellowish-white, with a black mole at the corner of his left brow and another beneath his left eye, each the size of a *gongcao* official’s seal. The soles of his feet bore raised patterns resembling tortoise-shell markings.\n\nFrom childhood, he was exceptionally intelligent, memorizing ten thousand words in a day and composing essays extemporaneously. In adulthood, he stood five *chi* and two *cun* tall. He favored the Huayang cap, wore a yellowish-white bordered robe, and tied a broad black sash, bearing a striking resemblance to Zhang Zifang.",

      "translated_text": "He remained unmarried until the age of twenty. While still in swaddling clothes, Ma Zu saw him and remarked: \"This child’s bone structure is extraordinary—he is surely a being beyond the mundane world. When the time comes, he will dwell where he encounters a hut and strike where he sees a bell. Remember this well.\"\n\nLater, while traveling on Mount Lu, he first met Fire Dragon Perfected, who transmitted to him the Heavenly Escape Sword Method. Thereafter, he mingled with common folk, selling ink among the people, and styled himself the Pure Yang Master. During the Xiantong era, he passed the imperial examinations; some say he did so in the Kaicheng era at the age of sixty-four. Others claim he first awakened to the Dao at fifty, and that when the sixty-four hexagrams were exhausted, he began anew with *Qian*—a sign of pure yang’s resonance.\n\nLater, while frequenting a wineshop in Chang’an, he saw a feathered immortal wearing a black headscarf and white robe, his long beard and bright eyes refined, a purple ornament in hand and a large gourd hanging at his waist. The immortal inscribed three quatrains on the wall:\n\n**I.**\nSitting or lying, ever clutching a jug of wine,\nI let not my eyes know the imperial capital.\nVast as heaven and earth, yet nameless,\nA carefree man among men.\n\n**II.**\nTrue immortals who have attained the Dao are seldom met—\nWhen shall I return, and would you follow?\nI say my dwelling borders the azure sea,\nThe first peak of Penglai, apart from all.\n\n**III.**\nDo not weary of laughter and joyous talk,\nFor parting and chaos weigh heavy on the mind.\nCounting on my fingers from the start,\nHow many have lived to see true peace?\n\nStartled by the immortal’s imposing and ancient appearance, as well as the soaring spirit of his verses, Dongbin bowed and asked his name. The immortal replied: \"My surname is Zhongli, my given name Quan, and my courtesy name Yunfang.\" Dongbin bowed again and invited him to sit. The extraordinary man said: \"Compose a quatrain for me, that I may see your skill.\" Dongbin’s brush did not pause as he wrote twenty-eight characters:\n\nBorn into a Confucian family in peaceful times,\nThe weight of office chains me, while common cloth feels light.\nWho in this world would vie for fame and profit?\nI serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nDelighted by the poem, Yunfang said: \"My dwelling lies on Crane Ridge in Zhongnan. Would you follow me there?\" Dongbin thus accompanied Yunfang to rest at the wineshop. Yunfang rose to prepare the meal, but Dongbin suddenly grew drowsy, resting his head on the table in a doze. He dreamed he was a scholar traveling to the capital, passing the imperial examinations as *zhuangyuan*. Beginning as a minor official in the provinces, he rose through the ranks—censor, academician, drafter of imperial decrees, secretary in the Hanlin Academy, and other prestigious posts—experiencing every promotion and demotion. Twice he married daughters of wealthy families, his weddings and offspring flourishing, his household filled with heirs and in-laws. For nearly forty years, he held power, his influence scorching like blackened iron. Then, abruptly, he was charged with grave crimes: his family’s wealth was confiscated, his wives and children scattered, and he was exiled to the southern frontier, left destitute and emaciated. Standing alone in the wind and snow, he sighed deeply—only to awaken with a start. Yunfang stood beside him, the millet still uncooked, and laughed: \"The millet is not yet done, yet you’ve dreamed your way to Huaxu.\" Dongbin exclaimed: \"Do you know my dream?\" Yunfang replied: \"The dream you just had—its rises and falls, its glories and sorrows, all fifty years of it—passed in an instant. Gain is not worth rejoicing over, nor loss worth grieving. Only after great awakening does one realize that the affairs of this world are but a grand dream.\" Dongbin, moved and sighing, understood that the official path was not worth clinging to. He bowed again and said: \"Master, you are no ordinary man. I beg you to guide me toward transcending the world.\" Yunfang feigned reluctance: \"Your bones are not yet perfected, your resolve and conduct still lacking. If you seek transcendence, you must endure several more lifetimes.\" With that, he departed in a flutter, leaving Dongbin disheartened and lost. Dongbin abandoned his official post and retreated into seclusion.\n\nThereafter, Yunfang tested Dongbin ten times, and he passed every trial (to be recounted later). One day, a man descended with a clap of laughter—it was Yunfang. He said to Dongbin: \"The dust of the world is hard to erase, and true immortal talent is rare. My search for a worthy disciple is more urgent than others’ search for me. You have passed my ten trials—attaining the Dao is assured. Yet your merits and deeds remain incomplete. I now bestow upon you the secret alchemical method of transforming base metals into gold and silver, that you may aid the world and benefit all beings. When your three thousand merits are fulfilled and your eight hundred deeds perfected, I will return to guide you.\" Dongbin asked: \"Will the gold and silver thus created ever revert to their original form?\" Yunfang replied: \"After three thousand years, they will return to their base nature.\" Dongbin frowned: \"To mislead people three thousand years hence is not what I wish.\" Yunfang smiled: \"With such a heart, your three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are already complete.\" He then revealed to Dongbin the origins of his own attainment: he had once met the Perfected Lord of Bitter Bamboo, who told him, \"When you journey among mortals, if you encounter a man with two mouths, he shall be your disciple.\" Later, he roamed mountains and seas but never found such a person. Now, upon examining your surname, it truly matches the prophecy of Bitter Bamboo.\" He added: \"Will you follow me?\" Dongbin accompanied him to Crane Ridge, where they came upon a small grotto, its entrance aglow with starlight and moonlight, the surroundings utterly still. Yunfang took Dongbin’s hand, and after just a few steps, it seemed as though they rode swift horses across mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at the southern gate of the grotto, its lock thick with dust. Yunfang tied a green silk cord to Dongbin’s sash, and together they slipped through the crack in the door. Suddenly, the space opened wide. Ascending a high peak, they reached a great grotto gate, where two tigers crouched as guardians. Yunfang shouted, and the tigers lay motionless. He led Dongbin inside, where golden towers and jade terraces stood amid rare birds and jade-like trees, the radiance dazzling, the climate as mild as spring. They sat upon a rock, drinking three cups of Primordial Harmony wine and discoursing on the Dao. Before long, a maiden in green appeared, her double buns adorned with golden bells, her crimson skirt and emerald sleeves trailing, her cloud-patterned shoes and jade pendants tinkling, an extraordinary fragrance wafting about her. In her hands she held a jade tablet inscribed in gold: \"The immortals have gathered in the Upper Palace of Penglai. The Master is summoned to the Heavenly Pond Assembly to discuss the spiritual travels of the Five Origin Perfected.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yunfang prepared to depart, and Dongbin saw him off with a poem:\n\n*\"To meet once you’ve attained the Dao is rare indeed,\nNow eastward you go to the immortal altar’s seat.\nA staff tipped with spring’s hues and a gourd of wine,\nA cloud-piercing cap that crowns the Five Peaks’ shrine.\nThe sea-turtle’s child—none know its face,\nThe mountain-burning talisman—ghosts dare not trace.\nWhen you are gone, this frame must age and fade,\nI beg you grant this poor scholar the bone-changing jade.\"*\n\nThis was his fear—that Yunfang might not return.\n\nYunfang replied, *\"Stay here, for I shall not be long.\"* Then, facing southeast, he ascended upon a purple cloud, drifting slowly away.\n\nDongbin took the plain-bound scrolls Yunfang had left him, unrolling and reciting them as he dwelled alone in the cave. Ten days later, Yunfang returned and asked, *\"You have been in solitude here—do you not long for home?\"*\n\nDongbin answered, *\"Having resolved my heart to study the Dao, how could I yearn for the mountains of the world?\"*\n\nYunfang said, *\"Excellent, excellent! You do not yet grasp the subtleties of yin and yang’s union and division. Clinging to yin alone makes one but a po, while preserving yang alone makes one but a hun. If you can gather the yang-hun to merge with the yin-po, so that yin and yang meet and hun and po become one in truth, then you are a Perfected.\"*\n\nDongbin asked, *\"Hun and po dwell in darkness—how can one preserve the form when the principle runs so deep?\"*\n\nThe Master replied, *\"When wisdom arises from obscurity and the spirit settles in perfect stillness, once spirit and essence merge, how could one not unite with the Real? A golden form and jade substance arise from utmost sincerity. When the Great Elixir is complete, the body becomes light as flight.\"*\n\nFrom then on, Dongbin posed ten questions on the cultivation of truth (recorded later), and Yunfang imparted to him all the profound secrets of the Supreme Perfected, utterly dispelling the dust and filth of the world. Soon, someone knocked at the door—it was Zheng Siyuan of Qingxi and the Perfected Shi of Mount Taihua, arriving from the southeast. They walked as if treading empty air, their forms suffused with golden and azure radiance. Greeting one another, they sat together, and Zheng said, *\"We have been apart too long! We had just come from Yin Siyi’s alchemical furnace and thought to visit your immortal gate.\"*\n\nThe Perfected Shi asked, *\"Who is this attendant?\"*\n\nThe Master replied, *\"The son of Lü Rang of Haizhou in our dynasty. In his youth, he studied the Confucian classics but failed in the capital. By chance, he met me in a wineshop in Chang’an and followed me into the Dao, mastering the subtleties of yin and yang, refining form and spirit to enter the wondrous.\"*\n\nDongbin bowed to the two guests, and Zheng and Yin said, *\"His form is pure, his spirit present, his eyes bright, his essence concealed. If you wish to escape the world’s snares, let us hear a poem from you.\"* They presented Dongbin with a golden brush, a rosy-clouded writing mat, divine glue, and a rhinoceros-horn inkstone. Dongbin immediately composed a poem:\n\n*\"Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives I came to this,\nOnly now does this body begin to feel light as flight.\nBeyond the clouds and mountains, I left home and country behind,\nRefining po and perfecting hun with the sun and moon’s essence refined.\nI have heard the Perfected discourse on the Nine Cauldrons’ might,\nAnd seek the Great Elixir through the Three Clarities’ height.\nNow, having met a true immortal face to face,\nMy name is entered in the Purple Palace’s immortal space.\"*\n\nThe three guests exchanged glances, marveling at his talent and the beauty of his lines. As spring birds chirped, the Master said to Dongbin, *\"Write something at the cave’s entrance.\"*\n\nDongbin inscribed:\n*\"Spring’s breath fills the sky, flower-dew drips,\nMorning sun strikes the sea, peaks’ clouds drift.\"*\n\nThe Master then said, *\"My audience at the Primordial Court draws near. The feathered guests of the Ten Isles will report these merits at the Jade Capital to ascend the immortal ranks. You may not remain long in this cave. We shall meet again in ten years at Dongting Lake.\"* Taking up a brush, he swiftly wrote sixteen characters on the cave’s stone wall:\n\n*\"By day, lofty and bright,\nBy night, the moon full and clear.\nYin and yang, hun and spirit,\nMerge and ascend together.\"*\n\nTossing the brush aside, he told Dongbin, *\"As you wander the world, practice the Dao of benefiting and saving others. When your merit is complete and your work fulfilled, we shall meet again.\"*\n\nThen Yunfang transmitted to Dongbin the *Lingbao Bifa* (*Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure*). Originally, Yunfang had obtained the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* in three sections from a stone wall on Mount Zhongnan: the *Upper Section: Golden Decrees of the Primordial Beginning*, the *Middle Section: Jade Records of the Sun-Origin Sovereign*, and the *Lower Section: True Principles of the Supreme Perfected*—altogether several thousand scrolls. Yunfang distilled their essence into the *Bifa*, dividing it into twelve branches and six principles. It expounded how yin contains yang and yang contains yin, the Dao of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent; how qi generates water and water generates qi, the mechanism of heart and kidney’s union. It used the eight trigrams to move the twelve hours, with its crux in *gen*; the three fields to interact and revolve, with its crux in the *niwan*. As for the initial practice, it provisionally likened it to swallowing qi and rinsing the saliva—but the true oral instructions lay in mind-to-mind transmission, not in written words.\n\nYunfang then showed Dongbin several grains of numinous elixir, saying, *\"These are not the world’s five metals or eight minerals, but a compound of the world’s rarest treasures. Though they have substance, they are formless—like clouds, like fire, like light, like shadows, visible yet intangible. When consumed, they merge with a person’s hun and consciousness into one, light and subtle, not like an elixir of tangible form.\"* He then presented a poem:\n\n*\"I know you possess a heroic and numinous bone,\nSo I teach you the heart’s state of vagueness and haze.\nIn the Crystal Palace atop the Hall of Embracing Primordial,\nI clearly point out the grotto-heaven of immortals’ ways.\nA true man, meeting the true formula, must hold fast with a fierce heart.\nThe five phases match like a knife’s edge—grasp the inverted turtle-snake art.\nThe Three Corpses’ spirits must be cast out,\nAdvancing and retreating, the celestial mechanism shines, the six thieves routed.\nKnow the Three Essentials, and the ten thousand spirits return,\nCome riding the fire dragon, departing the Nine Gates’ turn.\nWhen the nine-by-nine Dao reaches completion and you become true,\nThe Three Realms and Four Palaces will celebrate your Primordial Festival’s due.\nQi soars, spirit ever steadfast,\nPenglai is but my home’s vastness.\nThe assembled immortals feast, celestial music swells,\nTwin lads lead you in as an Ascending Transcendent’s guest.\nI transmit this to you because your Dao-heart does not retreat,\nWe swear an oath, our words sealed with blood’s heat.\nDo not speak of it carelessly to others you meet,\nNor reveal it needlessly to friends you greet.\nDo not blame me for repeating these words so oft,\nFor carelessness will bring the Underworld’s rebuke aloft.\nHolding hands, we part—what more can I say?\nToday, I sing for you this song anew.\nThough I’ve expounded a thousand wondrous principles profound,\nWho knows if your heart truly believes them sound?\"*",

      "translated_text": "After midnight, I have clearly told you all—cherish these words well, and you shall ascend to the Great Luo Heaven.\n\nAs Zhongli’s transmission neared its end, two immortals suddenly appeared, their robes shimmering with rosy clouds, bearing in hand a golden tablet and sacred talisman. They announced: \"By the Emperor’s decree, Zhongli Quan is appointed the Celestial Jade Palace’s Immortal-Selecting Envoy.\" Turning to Dongbin, he said: \"I now ascend to heaven. You must remain in the world, cultivating merit and virtue—one day, you too shall be as I am.\" Dongbin bowed twice and replied: \"My aspirations differ from yours, Master. I must first deliver all beings in the world before ascending—it will not be too late then.\"\n\nThen, phoenixes soared and auspicious cranes took flight, golden banners and jade scepters gleamed, celestial music swelled at dawn, and Master Zhongli, with the two decree-bearing immortals, rose slowly upon the clouds and departed. Having already received the Dao from Master Yunfang, Dongbin was further granted the Heaven-Escape Sword Method by the True Man of Fire Dragon. With it, he severed affliction, desire, and greed and wrath. He once wrote a poem:\n\n*In years past, I met the Fire Dragon Lord,*\n*A sword was passed to me, my constant guard.*\n*Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers—all may dissolve,*\n*Stars and sun and moon—let their wheels halt and resolve.*\n*Know this: the original nature endures through kalpas untold,*\n*Yet in vain do men seek it through springs ten thousandfold.*\n*Last night, Zhongli spoke but one word—*\n*The six heavens’ palaces would crumble to dust, I heard.*\n\nDongbin first roamed the Jiang-Huai region, testing his divine sword to slay a monstrous flood dragon. His appearances and transformations were myriad, and to this day, over four hundred years have passed. Since pledging his great vow to Yunfang, he has drifted through the turbid world, practicing transformation and delivering beings. Though Dongbin remains in the world, he has already transcended its bounds.\n\nDongbin said: \"If people strive to see me, yet upon seeing me fail to follow my words, what benefit is there in being with me day and night? If one can be loyal to their country, filial and kind to their family, trustworthy to friends, benevolent to those below, never slight their own heart, nor deceive in secret—using skillful means to aid others, and with hidden virtue moving heaven and earth—then gods and humans will love them, and ghosts and spirits will revere them. In this single thought, they are already one with me. Though they may not see me, they have seen me indeed.\n\nFor the nature of humanity is this: when the mind turns toward goodness, it belongs to yang, its nature brightens and ascends into lightness and purity—this is the path to heaven. When the mind turns toward evil, it belongs to yin, its nature darkens and sinks into coarseness and weight—this is the stairway to hell. Heaven and hell are not ruled by any lord; they are but the self-made transformations of the human heart.\"\n\nIn the early Jianlong reign of Emperor Taizu of Song, Dongbin emerged from the rear palace gardens and addressed the emperor as \"Zhuling, the Supreme Thearch,\" declaring that by the virtue of fire, he would rule the world. He spoke for some time, his words profound and not to be transmitted. The emperor removed his cinnabar robe and jade belt to bestow upon him, but in an instant, Dongbin vanished. The emperor ordered his portrait painted on the Taiqing Tower, and Daoist registrar Chen Jingyuan disseminated his likeness to the world.\n\nDuring the Zhenghe era, a malevolent spirit haunted the palace, appearing even in broad daylight to steal gold and treasures and violate the imperial consorts—only the emperor’s chambers remained untouched. Though Lin Lingsu, Wang Wenqing, and other court Daoists attempted to exorcise it, the disturbance would cease only to return. The emperor fasted and prayed devoutly, submitting six memorials. One day, as he napped, he saw a Daoist outside the Eastern Flower Gate, wearing a kingfisher-blue lotus crown and a purple crane-feather cloak, holding a crystal ruyi. The Daoist bowed before him and said: \"I come by the Emperor’s command to subdue this evil.\" After a while, a golden-armored figure, ten feet tall, seized the spirit and devoured it nearly whole. The emperor asked who this mighty warrior was, and the Daoist replied: \"This is Lord Guan Yu, the Venerable Casket True Lord, whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed.\" The emperor repeatedly expressed his gratitude, then asked where Zhang Fei was. Guan Yu said: \"Fei is my brother through countless kalpas. Now, he has been reborn in the Yue family of Xiangzhou and will one day assist in the restoration of the dynasty—his merit will be great.\" The emperor asked the Daoist’s name. He replied: \"I am surnamed Yang, born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month.\"",

      "translated_text": "The emperor awoke and recorded the dream, then summoned his attendants to recount it, suspecting the Daoist to be Lü Dongbin. From that time on, the palace was at peace. He then issued an edict to all regions where Lü Dongbin was venerated with incense and fire, bestowing upon him the title \"Perfected Master of Wondrous Communication.\" This was the beginning. The edict read:\n\n\"We revere the great Dao that unites ruler and people. All hidden immortals are recorded in the celestial registers, yet some silently respond to prayers—such virtue deserves honor. The Perfected Lü concealed his radiance and concealed his name, wandering near and far. When We established the Palace of Blessings, he happened to lodge there. Admiring this divine resonance, We confer upon him a title. Though his spirit is solemn and distant, may it deign to witness this grace. Let him be enfeoffed as Perfected Master of Wondrous Communication. His statue shall be sculpted in the Palace of Radiant Spirits, where seasonal sacrifices shall be offered.\"\n\n**The Ten Trials of Lü Dongbin by Cloud Chamber**\n\n**First Trial:** Lü Dongbin returned from afar to find all his family stricken with illness and dead. His heart remained untroubled; he prepared funeral arrangements, and soon the dead revived, unharmed.\n\n**Second Trial:** Lü sold goods at the market, setting their price with integrity. Buyers suddenly offered only half the agreed sum. He did not argue but relinquished the goods, taking neither the full nor half payment.\n\n**Third Trial:** On New Year’s Day, Lü encountered a beggar at his door seeking alms. He gave money and goods, but the beggar demanded more, hurling insults and brandishing a blade. Lü bowed repeatedly in apology, bared his chest to the knife, and the beggar departed laughing.\n\n**Fourth Trial:** While herding sheep in the mountains, Lü was pursued by a tiger. He pushed a sheep down a steep slope and stood alone before the beast, which then departed.\n\n**Fifth Trial:** Lü read in a mountain hut when a maiden of seventeen or eighteen appeared—her beauty unmatched, her radiance dazzling. She claimed to be returning to her mother’s home but had lost her way. As dusk fell, she pleaded exhaustion and sought rest. Her coquettish manner and countless advances persisted for three days, yet Lü remained unmoved. She then departed.\n\n**Sixth Trial:** Lü returned from the outskirts to find his home plundered by bandits, leaving him with nothing for daily sustenance. Unperturbed, he tilled the land to support himself. While plowing, he unearthed dozens of gold ingots but swiftly buried them, taking nothing.\n\n**Seventh Trial:** Lü purchased copper vessels at the market, only to find them turned to gold upon returning home. He sought the seller and returned them.\n\n**Eighth Trial:** A mad Daoist sold medicine in the streets, claiming it would kill anyone who consumed it. After ten days, none had bought it. Lü, sensing deeper intent, purchased the medicine. The Daoist warned, \"Prepare your final affairs; I must depart.\" Yet Lü suffered no ill effects.\n\n**Ninth Trial:** During spring floods, others struggled to cross, but Lü poled a small boat into the raging currents. Waves tossed the vessel, yet he sat unmoved, resigned to life or death—unharmed in the end.\n\n**Tenth Trial:** Lü sat alone when countless grotesque spirits and demons appeared, some striking, others threatening death. He paid them no mind. Then, dozens of yakshas dragged forth a bloodied, shackled prisoner, who wailed, \"You killed me in a past life—now repay my life!\" Lü replied, \"A life for a life is just,\" and seized a blade and rope to end himself. Suddenly, a voice thundered from the sky, and the spirits vanished. Cloud Chamber descended, clapping and laughing.\n\n---\n\n**Lü Dongbin’s Ten Questions to Cloud Chamber**\n\n**First Question: Heaven and Earth**\nCloud Chamber answered: \"Heaven seeks thrice, and in union with Earth, generates the Three Yang. Earth seeks thrice, and in union with Heaven, generates the Three Yin. Within Yang lies Yin—this is True Yin. When True Yin reaches Heaven, it arises through Yang. Within Yin lies Yang—this is True Yang. When True Yang reaches Earth, it emerges through Yin. Their union attains the Dao, naturally enduring.\"\n\n**Second Question: Sun and Moon**\n\"The moon receives the sun’s essence, transforming Yang into Yin. When Yin reaches its extreme, Yang becomes pure, and the moon’s radiance shines clear. Cultivating to this point, accumulated qi becomes spirit.\"\n\n**Third Question: The Four Seasons and Five Phases**\n\"Within one heart lie the Five Phases; within one day lie the Four Seasons. Fundamentally, Yin and Yang alternate. Yang cannot exist without Yin, yet ultimately, no Yin means no death. Yin cannot exist without Yang, yet ultimately, Yin’s exhaustion yields all Yang.\"\n\n**Fourth Question: Water, Fire, Dragon, and Tiger**\n\"Within the body are sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire. True fire emerges from water—elusive and indistinct, a thing unseen and ungraspable. True water arises from fire—profound and obscure, its essence visible yet ungraspable. This is kidney water. Within water lies qi, called True Fire—heart fire. Within fire arises fluid, called True Water. Water generates wood: when kidney qi is sufficient, liver qi arises, cutting off the kidney’s residual Yin, and as qi passes through the liver, it becomes pure Yang. Concealing the water of True Unity, in its elusiveness, is called the True Dragon. Fire overcomes metal: when heart fluid is abundant, lung fluid arises, cutting off the heart’s residual Yang, and as fluid reaches the lungs, it becomes pure Yin. Concealing the qi of True Yang, in its profundity, is called the True Tiger. Extracting water from qi and qi from water, obtaining a grain of millet, returning it to the Yellow Court—this is the Great Elixir.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Fifth Inquiry on Lead and Mercury:**\nLead is heavy by nature and inclined to sink—this is kidney water, which moistens downward and readily leaks. Mercury is light by nature and inclined to rise—this is heart fire, which flames upward and readily scatters. Using lead to restrain mercury, employing heaviness to anchor light flight, the inner elixir coalesces.\n\n**Sixth Inquiry on Withdrawal and Augmentation:**\nAfter the winter solstice, Yang ascends from the earth, and the earth withdraws its Yin. Greater Yin withdraws to become Reverting Yin; Lesser Yang augments to become Yang Brightness. Reverting Yin withdraws to become Lesser Yin; Yang Brightness augments to become Greater Yang. After the summer solstice, Yin descends from heaven, and heaven withdraws its Yang. Greater Yang withdraws to become Yang Brightness; Lesser Yin augments to become Reverting Yin. Yang Brightness withdraws to become Lesser Yang; Reverting Yin augments to become Greater Yin.\n\nIt is also like the sun and moon: the moon receives the sun’s *hun*-soul, and the sun receives the moon’s *po*-spirit. In the first fifteen days, the moon withdraws its *po*-spirit while the sun augments its *hun*-soul. Its essence and brilliance become full, illuminating the earth below. Otherwise, there would be no initial waxing to become the first quarter, nor the first quarter to become the full moon. The moon restores its Yin *po*; the sun gathers its Yang essence. In the latter fifteen days, the sun withdraws its *hun*-soul while the moon augments its *po*-spirit. Its light fades, and its Yin *po* stabilizes. Otherwise, there would be no full moon waning to the last quarter, nor the last quarter to become the dark of the moon. The sun and moon alternate in cycles of nine and six—this is the image of withdrawal and augmentation.\n\n**Seventh Inquiry on the River Chariot:**\nIn the human body, Yang is scant and Yin abundant, all being nothing but water. Thus, the meaning of the River Chariot is drawn from this. The River Chariot arises within the true water of the north, unlike the forced circulation of heterodox methods.\n\n**Eighth Inquiry on the Wonders of Inner Contemplation and Sitting in Forgetfulness:**\nWhen Dragon and Tiger unite in intercourse, Yin and Yang pair as mates. The Nine August True Persons guide a vermilion-robed youth to descend; the Nine August True Mothers guide a black-robed maiden to ascend. They meet before the Yellow Chamber. A yellow-robed crone receives them, like husband and wife in union, their joy complete. The maiden then descends again, and the youth ascends once more, like husband and wife parting.",

      "translated_text": "Clad in a white silk robe, girded with a black sash, my transformations were unfathomable—now a scholar, now a soldier. The world often spoke of me as one who could slay men with flying swords. Upon hearing this, I would laugh and say: \"Compassion is the mark of the Buddha. Even immortals are no different; how could they take lives? I do possess a sword, but it is unlike theirs. My three swords are these: the first severs greed and wrath, the second severs lust and desire, and the third severs vexation and sorrow.\"\n\nSince attaining the Dao, I have guided only two souls to transcendence: He Xiangu and Guo Shangchong. Their natures were keen and swift, so I taught them the method of Returning to the Root.\n\nI once told the world: \"To revere my true form is one thing, but to walk my path is another. To walk my path and practice my methods is yet another—then, without ever meeting me, you may achieve the Great Dao. Otherwise, what benefit is there in merely keeping company with me?\"\n\nThis record is inscribed at Wangjiang Pavilion in Jiangzhou.\n\n**The Perfected One’s Instruction of Lu Sheng in the Pillow**\n\nIn the seventh year of Kaicheng, there was a Daoist named Master Lü who had attained the arts of immortality. While traveling along the road between Luo and E, he rested at an inn, loosening his sash and sitting with his bag at ease. Soon after, he saw among the travelers a young man named Lu Sheng, styled Ying. Clad in a short hempen robe and riding a black colt, Lu was bound for his fields but likewise stopped at the inn. He sat beside the Daoist, and their conversation and laughter flowed freely.\n\nAfter some time, Lu Sheng glanced at his shabby attire and sighed deeply: \"A man born into this world yet so ill-fated—how can one not call this suffering?\" The Daoist replied: \"Your body bears no affliction or blemish, and your words are pleasant and fitting. Why then do you lament your hardship?\" Lu Sheng said: \"I merely endure this life—what pleasure is there to speak of?\" The Daoist asked: \"If this is not pleasure, then what is?\"\n\nLu Sheng answered: \"A scholar’s life in this world should be one of building merit and establishing fame, of leading armies and entering court, of feasting from tripods and listening to fine music. Only when one’s clan flourishes and one’s household prospers can one speak of true pleasure. I once aspired to learning and mastered many arts, believing that rank and honor would come as easily as plucking them from the ground. Yet now, past my prime, I still toil in the fields—how is this not suffering?\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, his eyes grew heavy with drowsiness. Just then, the innkeeper was steaming millet. The Daoist reached into his bag and produced a pillow, offering it to Lu Sheng: \"Rest your head upon this, and it shall grant you glory as you desire.\" The pillow was made of green porcelain, with openings at both ends.\n\nLu Sheng lowered his head to it and saw the openings gradually grow bright and vast. He entered with his whole body and soon found himself at home.",

      "translated_text": "Within months, he wed the daughter of the Cui clan of Qinghe, a woman of surpassing beauty whose dowry proved even richer than expected. Lu Sheng rejoiced greatly, and from that day his robes, carriages, and trappings grew ever more splendid. The following year, he passed the imperial examination and was appointed to the Hanlin Academy. By imperial decree, he was soon transferred to serve as magistrate of Weinan, then promoted to censor. Later, he became a recorder of the imperial court, then a drafter of edicts, and after three years was dispatched to govern Tongzhou before being elevated to oversee the Shaanxi region. Fond of meritorious deeds, he personally supervised the excavation of eighty li of riverbed in Shaanxi to restore blocked waterways, bringing great benefit to the people, who carved a stele to commemorate his virtue.\n\nTransferred to Bianzhou, he concurrently served as the imperial inspector of Henan. Soon after, he was summoned to the capital and appointed governor of the capital prefecture. That year, as the Divine Martial Emperor was engaged in campaigns against the northern tribes and expanding the empire’s borders, the Tubo forces under Xicailuo and Zhulong Mangbuzhi overran Guazhou and Shazhou. The regional commander, Wang Junchan, had just been killed, sending shockwaves through Hexi. The emperor, seeking a capable general, appointed Lu Sheng as censor-in-chief and military governor of Hexi. There, he crushed the barbarian hordes, beheading seven thousand, reclaiming nine hundred li of territory, and constructing a great fortress to guard the strategic pass. The borderland people erected a stele on Juyan Mountain in his honor.\n\nUpon his return to court, he was enfeoffed with the highest honors and rewards. Promoted to vice minister of personnel, he later became minister of revenue and concurrently grand censor. His reputation shone brightly, and the people’s hearts turned toward him. This aroused the envy of the prime minister, who slandered him with false accusations, leading to his demotion to prefect of Duanzhou. Three years later, he was recalled to serve as imperial attendant, and before long, he was appointed chancellor. Alongside Xiao Hao, the minister of the imperial court, and Pei Guangting, the vice minister of rites, he held the reins of power for over a decade. His wise counsel and secret directives were sought daily, and his advice—whether in support or remonstrance—earned him the title of worthy minister. Yet his peers, consumed by jealousy, falsely accused him of colluding with border generals in treasonous plots. An imperial edict ordered his arrest, and officers with their retinue stormed his gate to seize him.\n\nTerrified and bewildered, Lu Sheng turned to his wife and children: \"Our family has five hundred *mu* of fertile land in the mountains—enough to ward off cold and hunger. Why did I ever seek office, only to bring this upon myself? Now I long for the coarse cloth of a commoner, to ride a gray horse along the roads of Jun and E, but it is no longer possible.\" He drew his blade to take his own life, but his wife intervened in time to save him. Though his accomplices were all executed, Lu Sheng was spared by the intercession of a eunuch, his sentence reduced to exile in Yanzhou. Years later, the emperor learned of his innocence and recalled him, restoring him as chancellor and enfeoffing him as Duke of Yan. The imperial favor he received was extraordinary.\n\nLu Sheng had five sons: Jian, Fu, Wei, Dao, and Yi, all men of talent. Jian passed the imperial examination and served as vice director of the Bureau of Merit. Fu became a censor, Wei a secretary of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, Dao a magistrate of Wannian County, and Yi, the most virtuous, was appointed to the Imperial Guard at the age of twenty-eight. Their marriages allied them with the most illustrious families of the realm, and they had over ten grandsons. Twice exiled to distant frontiers, twice elevated to the highest offices, Lu Sheng served both at court and in the provinces, soaring through the ranks of the bureaucracy for over fifty years. His glory and splendor were unmatched, though his nature was somewhat extravagant and indulgent. Fond of music and pleasure, he kept the finest singers and beauties in his rear pavilion. The emperor bestowed upon him countless gifts—fertile lands, grand estates, rare treasures, and prized horses.\n\nAs he grew old and infirm, he repeatedly petitioned to retire, but the emperor refused. During his illness, officials lined the roads to inquire after his health, and the finest physicians and rarest medicines were sent without fail. On his deathbed, he submitted a memorial: \"I was but a humble scholar from the eastern mountains, content with my fields and gardens, when by chance I encountered this sagely reign and was counted among the officials. I was showered with undeserved rewards and extraordinary favor. Abroad, I held the banner of command; at court, I ascended to the highest offices.\"",

Though I have been unworthy of Heaven’s grace, I have done nothing to advance the sagely transformation. Like one who rides in a carriage meant for the virtuous only to invite bandits, or treads thin ice with mounting dread, I have lived in daily fear—unaware even of old age’s approach. Now past eighty, I have risen to the rank of the Three Dukes. The clepsydra’s flow has ceased, and my sinews and bones are wholly withered. As I linger in this sinking stupor, my allotted time nears its end. Looking back, I have offered no service worthy of such radiant reign, and have only squandered profound favor. Now I take eternal leave of this sagely age, overwhelmed by gratitude and longing. With reverence, I submit this memorial in humble thanks.\n\nThe imperial edict replied: \"With your outstanding virtue, you have served as Our foremost minister.

      "translated_text": "At Heaven’s Heart Bridge in Wuchang, Lü Dongbin wandered in disguise, selling worn wooden combs under an assumed name. He set the price at a thousand coins, yet for months no one bought one. Then an old beggar woman, over eighty years old, hobbled by—her frame bent, her hair white as snow. Dongbin said to her, “People cling to what lies before their eyes and follow the commonplace. I price this shabby thing so high—could there be some deeper meaning? Yet among thousands, none has the insight to see it. How can I speak of the Dao with them?” He took the comb and combed her hair; with each stroke, her hair grew longer, her temples turned black, and her withered face grew young. The crowd, astonished, began clamoring for combs. Dongbin laughed and said, “They see but do not recognize; they recognize but do not see.” He tossed the comb into the river below, where it transformed into a blue-green dragon and soared away. Dongbin and the old woman vanished.\n\nPainting the Mountain at Luofu\nLü Dongbin traveled to Zhu Ming Abbey on Mount Luofu. Arriving at a small hermitage, he found the Daoist master away, with only a young novice present. The boy bowed and said, “Sir, please sit here.” He then stole some of the master’s wine and offered it to Dongbin, who drank his fill and urged the boy to finish the rest. The boy refused, for he had long suffered from a cataract in his left eye. Dongbin dabbed the leftover wine on the boy’s eye, and suddenly it cleared, as if he had never been afflicted. Dongbin then took up a brush and painted a mountain on the wall, with three ponds at its base. He told the boy, “If you had drunk my wine, you would have attained immortality. Since you did not, your fate is sealed—but you will still live ten thousand years.” With that, he flew into the stone wall and disappeared. When the Daoist master returned and saw the painted mountain, which now spanned both sides of the wall, he exclaimed in shock, “The three ponds below form the character *cha*—was this not Master Lü?” Later, the boy indeed lived to one hundred and fifty before passing away.\n\nTempering the Sword at Mount Lu\nLü Dongbin visited Zhenji Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. By the steps, he tempered his sword. The Daoist Hou Yonghui asked, “What is the purpose of your sword?” Dongbin replied, “To rid the world of all injustice.” Hou, struck by his words, invited him to drink wine and eat fruit, saying, “Your demeanor is lofty and pure—you cannot be an ordinary man of this world.” Dongbin replied, “Let us drink heartily; do not press me with questions.” Once drunk, he wrote a poem on the wall with a chopstick:\n\n*Dare I shrink from toil to hone this blade?*\n*At dawn, the jade dragon roars when the case is opened.*\n*In my hand, qi coils like three feet of ice;*\n*The spirit of the stone king is a single serpent.*\n*Treacherous blood silently flows away with the water;*\n*Villains now vanish with the fading stains.*\n*To cut down the world’s injustices,*\n*I shall ascend with you to the nine heavens.*\n\nWhen he finished, the words seemed invisible at first, but the ink’s edges gleamed brightly, shining through to the other side of the wall. Hou, astonished, bowed deeply and asked about the poem. Dongbin said, “There are Daoist swords and there are ritual swords. The Daoist sword moves in and out of formless realms; the ritual sword defends those who govern. This is what common eyes see—it merely dispels demons and banishes evil spirits.” Hou asked, “If you used the Daoist sword to slay villains in a crowded place, would it not shock the world?” Dongbin replied, “Man’s spirit is the mother, and qi is the child. When the spirit remains, qi gathers; when the spirit departs, qi scatters. If you strike the spirit, the qi will leave, and the person will vanish of their own accord. Even if they borrow another’s form, it is all the same.” Hou sighed and said, “These are truly the words of an immortal. May I know your name?” Dongbin said, “I am Lü Cha.” With that, he threw his sword into the air and followed it into the sky.\n\nScattering Coins in Guangling\nLü Dongbin once wandered the markets of Guangling, scattering ten thousand coins in the streets. By evening, he checked and found that all ten thousand had been picked up, save for three. One had fallen into the mud, another into the grass, and the last into a crevice between bricks in a well, about three inches from the opening. Later, two men came to draw water, saw the coin, and fought over it. Dongbin sighed at how deeply the pursuit of wealth consumed people’s hearts.\n\nTurning Earth into Incense\nDuring the Song dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Tianjue received a Daoist in tattered robes who came daily to beg for alms. The minister, failing to show proper respect, jokingly asked what immortal arts the Daoist possessed. The Daoist replied that he could turn earth into incense, and Zhang asked for a demonstration. In an instant, the incense smoke faded, and the Daoist vanished, leaving only a poem on the table:\n\n*Turning earth to incense has its reasons,*\n*In this world, the false is fitting, the true is not.*\n*Prime Minister Zhang Tianjue of the imperial court,*\n*And Lü Dongbin, the cloud-roaming immortal.*\n\nWater Transformed into Wine\nMa Shan was a man from the Eastern Capital...",

      "translated_text": "In the early Xining reign, Ma Shan failed the imperial examinations and turned to Daoist cultivation. One day, he walked along the Bian River with a Daoist named Hou when they encountered a feathered immortal—clad in a blue headscarf and plain robe, his form refined, his bones extraordinary, his eyes bright as limpid water, his face free of dust. Ma invited him to drink tea and share a meal. Hou, ever cautious, scoffed at the stranger, who replied, \"I possess the art of immortality.\" Hou asked what method he used, and the immortal inquired in return, \"What arts do *you* practice?\" Hou answered, \"I command flying talismans to summon ghosts, transmute stone into gold, and return coins to their original form as jade.\" The immortal said, \"Such arts are not the true Way.\" Hou asked, \"Then what can *you* do?\" The immortal replied, \"I can strengthen my *qi* and purify my spirit.\" Hou pressed, \"What does that mean?\" The immortal said, \"Observe.\" He exhaled a breath toward a wineshop tens of yards away, and the candle within was instantly snuffed out. Then he exhaled toward Hou’s face, and a gust like a gale struck him, so fierce he could scarcely endure it. Both men rose and bowed, saying, \"Sir, you are no ordinary man—we beg your instruction.\" The immortal said, \"To cultivate immortality, one must establish merit and conduct: merit through diligent practice, conduct through aiding others and benefiting all things.\" Hou replied, \"I have spent my life healing people with medicine—is that not merit and conduct?\" The immortal said, \"You take lives to save lives, killing one to preserve another. It would be better to cure illness with talismans and water alone.\" As dawn broke, the immortal took his leave, saying, \"I return to the banks of the Xiang River.\" He bade them farewell beneath a willow’s shade, giving Hou a hundred taels of silver to buy wine. Finding none, the immortal produced a bottle, had Hou fetch a flask of Bian River water, and dropped in a pill. Instantly, it turned into fine wine. The three drank deeply, and the immortal left behind a poem:\n\n*Three mouths share one chamber,*\n*By its side, the water runs clear.*\n*Born to wander the world,*\n*Such is my surname and given name.*\n\nAfter parting, the two realized he was Lü Dongbin.\n\n**Ink Transformed into Gold**\nHan Qi, the Duke of Loyalty and Wisdom, only began inviting alchemists in his later years. One day, Lü Dongbin arrived in tattered robes, his face smeared with grime, seeking an audience. Han dismissed him, asking, \"What can you do?\" Dongbin replied, \"I can make ink.\" When told to demonstrate, he dug a pit in the ground. Han grew displeased, but Dongbin kneaded the earth into ink, saying, \"It is done.\" He then departed. Han examined the ink and found it was pure gold, bearing Lü’s name. When broken, the gold revealed Lü’s mark throughout its texture. Han regretted his dismissal endlessly.\n\n**Square Holes in Paper**\nZhao Yingdao, a supervisor at the Court of Imperial Regalia, suffered from malaria so severe he neared death. Weeping, he bid farewell to his family, saying, \"I am lost. I would give away everything in my home, but my white-haired parents have no one to care for them—what is to be done?\" Before he could finish, a Daoist knocked at the door and said, \"Your illness is not difficult to cure.\" He took two sheets of paper, folding each into a square hole roughly two feet wide, and gave them to Zhao, saying, \"Burn one tonight, grind its ashes, mix them with frankincense decoction, and apply it to the afflicted area. Keep the other for future use.\" With that, the Daoist vanished. Only then did Zhao realize the two square holes formed the character *Lü*.\n\n**Square Holes in Stone**\nLou Daoming of Zitong was a wealthy man well-versed in Daoist arts. He kept ten young maidens, replacing any who became pregnant with a new one, ensuring their number never fell below ten. Day and night, he took them in turn without rest, yet his spirit remained clear, his body robust, his complexion as fresh as a peach blossom. He could go days without eating, and at ninety-seven, appeared no older than thirty. Fond of boasting, he would tell guests at his feasts that the Mysterious Woman sent him wine, the Plain Girl brought him fruit, or that Peng Zu and Rong Cheng had bequeathed him their writings, claiming himself a true immortal. One day, Lü Dongbin, disguised as a beggar, arrived at his gate. Lou, failing to recognize him, shouted at him to leave. Dongbin pressed his feet into the stone, leaving two square holes three inches deep. Lou, astonished, invited him in and seated him at his side, saying, \"You are no beggar.\" He ordered his maidens to sing *Songs of Roaming Immortals* and serve wine. Dongbin improvised a *Wang Jiangnan* lyric in response:\n\n*Upon Jade Pool,*\n*Auspicious mists gather ‘round the immortals.*\n*White-clad lads strike phoenix chimes,*\n*Green-robed maidens play simurgh pipes.*\n*I dwell in the Great Brahma Heaven.*\n*Drunk, I wander*\n*The misty peaks of Jade Capital Mountain.*\n*The hymns of void-step singing end,*\n*Yet I know not what year this is—*\n*Seas turn to mulberry fields once more.*\n\nA maid brought Sichuan paper and asked for his calligraphy. Dongbin wrote from the bottom of the page to the top, filling every space without a gap. Lou was overjoyed and sought to learn the essentials of the Dao, but Dongbin said, \"I have already transmitted it to you mouth to mouth.\" When Lou pressed further, he repeated, \"I have already transmitted it to you mouth to mouth.\" Suddenly, he climbed to the top of a large mulberry tree outside the gate and vanished. Days later, Lou fell ill, vomiting silver-like phlegm by the bucketful before dying. The \"mouth-to-mouth transmission\" and the two square holes in the stone were both veiled references to the character *Lü*.\n\n**Immortal Music at the Feast**\nChen Zhizhong built a grand estate in the Eastern Capital. As his family and friends gathered for a feast, a ragged Daoist arrived—Lü Dongbin in disguise. Chen asked, \"What skills do you possess?\" Dongbin replied, \"I have a set of immortal music to grace your splendid banquet.\" From his waist, he produced a scroll and hung it on a pillar. The painting depicted twelve celestial maidens, each holding a musical instrument. Dongbin called them down, and they descended like a string of pearls, lining up before him. Two maidens bearing banners led the way, while the others played their instruments. Their skin was jade-smooth, their faces flower-like, their demeanor dignified, their voices sweet. They wore seven-jeweled crowns, gossamer robes, golden clasps, and jade pendants that chimed as they moved. On each maiden’s nose rested a grain-sized piece of yellow jade, their bodies so light and ethereal they seemed scarcely human.",

After three movements, Chen asked, \"What manner of women are these?\" The Daoist replied, \"These are the Six Jia and Six Ding Jade Maidens.

Would you, sir, wish to learn?\"\n\nChen dismissed it as illusion and deception, growing increasingly displeased. The Daoist turned to the maidens and said, \"You may depart.\" They all returned to the painted scroll, which the Daoist then took and swallowed whole. He demanded paper and brush, writing boldly:\n\n*I have passed through three thousand kalpas in the heavens above,*\n*And lived five hundred years among mortals below.*\n*My waist-borne sword flashes with purple lightning,*\n*The elixir furnace’s flames rise in billowing smoke.*\n*Just now I rode a white deer across the azure sea,*\n*Then mounted a blue ox to enter the grotto-heavens.*\n*Such minor arts are but idle play—*\n*None know I am a true immortal.*\n\nAt the end, he signed: *Written by the Valley Guest.* He then strode out the door, vanishing in an instant.

When Dongbin came to visit, Zhai lodged him in his home with the utmost courtesy, and thus they came and went for over a year.

Stepping onto one half, he beckoned the calligrapher to do the same. Master Zhai, terrified, dared not advance, but Dongbin laughed and crossed to the far shore. In an instant, he vanished, and Zhai then knew him to be no ordinary man.\n\nTen days later, Dongbin returned, bringing food to share with Zhai—all of it rancid and rotten.

He constructed a grand *Baolu* Abbey, where masters of esoteric techniques gathered to display their skills. Dongbin, concealing his true name, lodged there and boasted of his abilities as surpassing all others. Taking a pinch of medicine, he rubbed it into his palm, blew upon it several times, and soon a crimson glow suffused outward, forming the image of a jeweled wheel upon which appeared the characters \"Dongbin.\" The crowd was astounded, but when they looked again, he had vanished.\n\n**A Boy Transformed into a Crane**\nAt the Zhenxian Hall of Tianqing Abbey in Changzhou stood a statue of Dongbin. A young boy selling indigo would pass by daily, and upon seeing the statue’s dignified bearing, he grew reverent and lingered, unwilling to leave. One day, as he gazed and sighed, the statue suddenly stirred, beckoning him with an outstretched hand. It held a coin to buy indigo, but the boy refused the money, offering instead all the stalks in his basket. The statue’s expression brightened, and it gave the boy a red pellet, instructing him to swallow it. At once, the boy felt dazed, as if drunk. Returning home, he demanded paper and brush to compose essays—his words and calligraphy were exquisite, and he became versed in astronomy, geography, and all manner of knowledge. He abstained from marriage, fire-cooked food, and meat, drinking only wine and eating dates. This continued for over a year.\n\nOne day, hearing of an execution in the marketplace, he rushed to watch. Just as the blade fell, a hand struck the condemned man’s left cheek from midair. A small crane flew from the corner of his mouth, and when the boy touched the man’s cheek, he found it half-withered. The man’s foolishness returned as before.\n\n**The Real Coin in the Boy’s Hand**\nIn Xianju, Taizhou, a man named Wang San encountered a beggar in the market selling a clay figurine of Master Lü. He bought it and enshrined it at home, offering incense with great reverence. His ten-year-old son also paid daily respects. One day, while herding cattle on a hillside, the boy saw a Daoist in white passing by. He leapt from the ox’s back, grasped the Daoist’s robe, and called out, \"Master Lü!\" The Daoist asked, \"How do you know to address me so? And how do you recognize me?\" The boy replied, \"You look just like the statue I worship at home—only taller.\" The Daoist laughed, placed a real coin in the boy’s hand, and warned, \"When you wish to buy something, use this. It will provide endlessly, but you must tell no one.\" Overjoyed, the boy returned home and secretly showed his father. The moment he spent one coin, another appeared in his palm.\n\nFor over a month, this continued, until the father’s greed grew boundless. He set a basket beside the boy and ordered him to keep brushing his hand against it. The coins fell one after another. By the third day, they had amassed over ten thousand. The next day, the coins ceased to appear.",

A pastry shop owner made a vow to the gods for relief. One day, a drunken patron arrived at his home, spewing vulgarities and smearing mud on the left side of the outer gate. The pastry maker found him unbearable—offering money was refused, offering pastries was spurned.\n\nEarlier, the wind had snapped a large tree, which the locals had split into two benches placed by the door for travelers to rest. The shop stood far from the river, and just as the owner had drawn two buckets of water, the drunk suddenly rose, tied straw into a brush, dipped it in the water, and began scrubbing the wood. He scrubbed vigorously for two hours, then stepped back to admire his work. Passersby, seeing it from afar, turned away in disgust, and by day’s end, not a single pastry was sold. The drunk finally left, bidding the owner, \"Do not be angry with me. Tomorrow, I will bring money to repay you—twice what you’re owed.\" As he walked off, he approached one of the benches, intending to sit, but upon seeing its radiant sheen, he took thick ink and boldly wrote: *The Living Master Lü*. He tried to scrape it off with a knife, but the more he scraped, the brighter the characters shone, penetrating deep into the wood as if engraved throughout. A crowd gathered to gawk.\n\nFrom that day on, the shop’s pastries and fruits sold briskly. This occurred in the second month of the thirty-second year of Shaoxing (1162). It was said that Shou Qing personally witnessed the wood-washing and described the Daoist as a gaunt figure.\n\n---\n\nIn the twenty-eighth year of Shaoxing (1158), a merchant from Huating loaded his boat with ten thousand reed mats bound for Lin’an. The vessel was packed to the brim. As he departed the western gate at dusk, a Daoist on the shore called out, asking for passage. The merchant replied, \"The boat is full—there’s not even room to stand outside. How could I accommodate you?\" The Daoist said, \"I’ll give you a thousand coins for just a mat’s worth of space.\" The merchant asked, \"What if it rains?\" The Daoist replied, \"I’ll give you another hundred coins to buy a mat for cover.\" Tempted by the money, the merchant allowed him aboard. The Daoist sat on a mat, barely enough to kneel on. He neither ate nor drank nor relieved himself, and no rain fell during the journey.\n\nUpon reaching the northern gate, he bid farewell, saying, \"Thank you for carrying me. I will repay you with twenty thousand coins.\" The merchant was baffled. That year, the imperial suburban sacrifice required vast quantities of reed mats. The Lin’an prefecture, fearing a shortage, raised the price by two coins per mat for all incoming shipments and bought them all. The merchant profited twenty thousand coins. After unloading, the bottommost mat bore six bold ink characters: *Lü Dongbin once rode this boat*. The calligraphy was vigorous, and those who saw it knew it was the hand of an immortal. The next day, the merchant entered the city and passed the Zhongan Bridge, where he encountered the same Daoist selling ginger in the market. He bowed and said, \"So you are Master Lü! I thought you could transform gold—give me some.\" The Daoist laughed and replied, \"Watch my ginger for me. I’ll return to my lodging to fetch the gold—guard it well.\" By nightfall, he had not returned. The merchant had the ginger delivered home by a servant, no longer resentful. Those who heard the tale found it absurd.\n\n---\n\nIn Yuan’an County of Xiazhou, the people revered immortals and Buddhas. They once held a feast in honor of Master Lü Chunyang, drawing a great gathering of Daoists. After the meal, an old soldier arrived from outside, clad in a green robe and hemp sandals, carrying two baskets slung from a pole. He squatted down, shouting for food, and refused to leave. The host, having leftover porridge, gave it to him, and he also demanded wine. With a small flask, he drained it in one gulp, repeating this several times. The host, astonished by his capacity, asked, \"Can you drink more?\" The soldier replied, \"I’d gladly do so, but your family is noble—I dare not impose.\" When more wine was brought, he downed it all without leaving a drop.\n\nHe then asked what the feast was for, and the host explained. The soldier said, \"If Master Lü himself appeared, would you recognize him?\" The host pointed to a painted portrait on the wall. The soldier laughed and said, \"My appearance and attire are nothing like that. Give me five feet of silk, and I’ll paint you a true likeness.\" Delighted, the host fetched the silk and handed it to him. Without applying ink or powder, the soldier merely rubbed the silk between his hands, then suddenly retched violently, wiping the silk with his vomit. The host was disgusted, assuming he was drunk, and the onlookers cursed and urged him to leave. After a while, the soldier tucked the silk into an empty space, bowed, and departed.\n\nA servant boy retrieved the silk and unfurled it—an immortal’s portrait had appeared. The figure’s tattered robes and sandals matched the soldier’s own. Realizing the immortal had descended, the host was filled with regret for his rudeness and framed the portrait for worship. This occurred in the seventh year of Chunxi (1180), and the story was recorded by Zhou Jianshan, a registrar from Xinchang.\n\n---\n\nAt the Du Family Garden Gathering...",

He set a basket beside the boy and ordered him to keep brushing his hand against it. The coins fell one after another. By the third day, they had amassed over ten thousand. The next day, the coins ceased to appear.",

      "translated_text": "In the sixteenth year of Shaoxing (1146), Wang Yinzu served as an officer in the Hubei Judicial Commission and lodged at the inn of Zhang Siguanren. Du Changyan of Wuling had a small garden where various flowers were in full bloom, and on the sixth day of the third month, he invited Wang, Zhang, and two or three other guests to gather for drinks. Midway through the feast, each guest plucked three blossoms from the tea bushes and tucked them into their headbands. Suddenly, a Daoist in a blue robe and Daoist attire, wearing a straw raincoat and bamboo hat, emerged with objects in his sleeves. He bowed to the company and said, “Gentlemen, your esteemed gathering—might I join your feast?” Du invited him to sit, poured a large cup of wine, and the Daoist drained it in one gulp. He devoured the meat with great relish, leaving not a morsel behind, then set down his chopsticks with a faint smile, his spirit radiant. “Allow me to offer a toast to honor all of you,” he said. Du asked him to wait a moment, but the Daoist replied, “I too have wine here—let me repay your kindness.” He then presented a cup and insisted they drink their fill. The guests dared not refuse, but he addressed Wang alone: “Your bearing is noble, and you possess the disposition for cultivating the Dao. The only pity is that worldly affairs still cling to you. For now, drink my wine.” Reaching into his sleeve, he drew out a tin flask, holding about two *sheng*, and poured for each guest. Though the wine had never been warmed, it was piping hot, its flavor pure and rich. Du marveled at this and saw that the flask still held about a cup’s worth. The Daoist asked, “Could you drink another cup?” Du replied, “Indeed, I would like to.” After he finished, Du jested, “How much wine does this flask hold that it never runs dry? Are you perhaps Master Dongbin?” The Daoist replied, “You have never met Elder Lü—why do you speak of him?” Then he laughed and said, “Would you gentlemen like to see him?” With that, he removed the bamboo hat from his back and tossed it into the air. His body rose over a *zhang* high, straddled a white crane, and vanished—along with the flask.\n\n**Coins Pressed into Stone**\nDuring the Jingtai era of the Song, a man named Yin who ran an incense and paper shop in Shaowu Military Prefecture regularly provided for wandering Daoists, always offering three coins without fail. One day, a Daoist arrived holding a millet-stalk fan and begged for money. Coincidentally, Yin was preoccupied with other matters and, in irritation, tossed three coins onto the fan—only for them to fall to the ground. The Daoist pressed them into the earth with his foot and left without a glance. Yin retrieved the coins, only to find them firmly embedded in the brick, immovable. Onlookers were astonished, but the Daoist had already disappeared. When Yin pried the brick loose with a hoe, he found a poem inscribed on its reverse:\n\n*For a lifetime, my great vow was to ferry three thousand souls,*\n*Yet to this day, it remains unfulfilled.*\n*I came here with purpose—*\n*Alas, the Yin family’s bones are not destined for immortality.*\n\nThis inscribed brick is now set into the wall of the City God Temple.\n\n**Manifestations of the Way – Sixteen Accounts**\nBy Lü Yuangui",

      "translated_text": "Lü Dongbin traveled to Jiangxia, disguising himself as Lü Yuangui. He frequented the home of a local resident, the Yang family, where he foretold fortunes and misfortunes with great accuracy. One day, he suddenly took his leave, saying, \"A wicked man is coming—I must avoid him.\" That very evening, Yu Lu, the Judicial Commissioner, arrived in Ezhou on an inspection tour. He immediately sought out Lü, but the latter had vanished. Instead, he found Lü’s usual associate, Cen Wenxiu. Yu demanded to know where Cen had hidden Lü, but Cen insisted he knew nothing. Yu grew furious, threatening to flog him, yet Cen’s answers remained unchanged. Yu then ordered a search of Cen’s home, where they discovered a long poem Lü had left behind, expounding on the practice of internal alchemy. Yu pondered the poem and realized: \"This is Master Lü. *Yuangui* is but a split of the characters in his name. As for the 'wicked man,' he must have meant me, for I pursued him relentlessly.\"\n\n**The Recluse of Qian and Kan**\nJinling’s Wan Tie, known as the Old Man of Iron and Stone, was of pure disposition and deeply drawn to the Dao. He sustained himself through planchette writing, and whenever he invoked the spirits, Lüzu would appear. One day, Lüzu appeared in his dream to explain the eight trigrams. Another dream foretold that on a certain day, a guest would arrive bearing a handwritten text he could request. When the appointed day came, the guest indeed appeared, and Wan obtained the text, which he used for divination for over a decade.\n\nIn the *gengwu* year of the Longqing era, Wan contracted a debilitating illness, his left arm bound in silk, forcing him to walk with a staff. On the twenty-first day of the eleventh month, he was carried in a sedan past Pude Temple. Alighting, he saw a Daoist who called out, \"Old Iron!\" Wan replied, \"Alas, I suffer from hemiplegia and am reduced to this.\" The Daoist rebuked him sharply: \"What do you mean by 'hemiplegia'? A half-withered tree may still bear both flourishing and withered branches, but it is inevitably consumed by fire. How can a man be the same?\" He then asked when the illness had begun. Wan answered, \"On the twenty-first day of the seventh month.\" The Daoist said, \"This is the sign of dense clouds without rain.\"\n\nWan asked, \"Is there a good medicine for it?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Is there a good moxibustion treatment?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then how shall I pass my days?\"\n\"By begging in the marketplace.\"\nWan noticed the gourd he carried and asked, \"Do you beg with that?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWan inquired after the Daoist’s surname, and he replied, \"Qian.\" Asked for his style, he said, \"Sicun.\" Wan pressed further: \"What does *cun* mean? What are you contemplating?\" The Daoist answered, \"*Cun* signifies difficulty in the *Yijing*. *Sicun* means I constantly reflect on hardship. I followed my master at six and have never known lust, though I still indulge in wine and wealth—yet I manage myself, unlike you, who brought this misfortune upon yourself.\" After a long silence, he expounded on the meaning of *cun* and said, \"Your illness stems from liver *qi*—this is *cun*.\" Then he called out, \"Old man, walk to the bridge.\" Wan, without realizing it, leaned on his staff and walked to the east gate of the temple.

Placing his hand on Wan’s waist and kidneys, he asked, “Does this feel sore?” Wan replied, “No.” The Daoist then pressed down to his knees and said, “Now it does.” Noticing a strip of cloth hanging from Wan’s hand, he reached into his robe and palpated up and down three times, remarking, “Fortunately, you are thin—you can be cured.” He added, “All five of your viscera are aflame. No medicine is needed, only Wuyi tea will suffice. The southeast-facing shoots are best. Steep them in mountain spring water—when the leaves stand upright, the infusion is ready; if you add well water, they will lie flat.”\n\nMoved by his kindness, Wan asked where he resided.

Zijun found him extraordinary and composed a poem on the spot to present to him:\n\n*“A Daoist Hui from Huazhou,*\n*Has come to the city of Yiyang.*\n*Where will you wander when you leave me?*\n*A sword lies across the autumn sky.”*\n\nDongbin laughed heartily, then vanished in an instant. Zijun ordered a portrait of him to be painted and placed in Yueyang Tower.\n\nThe Daoist Hui\nAt Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, over ten Daoists gathered in the storehouse hall. A visitor calling himself the Daoist Hui strode in with arms swinging, casting haughty glances at all present. The assembly muttered among themselves: *“Impostors abound, stealing this name to parade themselves—how vulgar! What use have we for such?”* They turned away without a glance, save for Hu Yongzong, who bowed and invited him in. They sat in a small pavilion, conversing with ease and grace. Struck by his bearing, Hu treated him with heightened respect. Soon, the Daoist asked for wine. Glancing about, he found a knife, scraped earth, and strained wine through it, mixing the dregs in his palm. Blowing on the paste, he shaped it into an inkstick and tossed it onto the table with a resonant *clink*. He told Hu: *“Keep this well—it too can cure illness.”* When Hu examined it, a rich fragrance filled the air, far surpassing orchid or musk. The Daoist then invited Hu to ascend a tower for wine, but Hu declined, citing the late hour. He departed with a laugh.\n\nThe next day, Hu hurried to the prefecture. Before dawn, he reached the city gate and encountered the Daoist emerging from within, laughing as he turned to look back. A clerk mentioned that the Daoist Hui had been waiting at the gate since midnight. Hu marveled even more. Upon returning home, he tested the knife—half had turned golden. After taking a small dose of the gifted ink, years later his appearance showed no sign of aging, and his capacity for wine grew daily.\n\nLater, the Daoist returned, clad in tattered robes and a worn hat, straw sandals and a hempen belt, carrying two gourds on a pole. He asked Hu what was inside. When Hu poured them out, they were revealed to be silver ingots. Only then did he realize this was the true Patriarch Lü. He bowed in reverence as a disciple and earnestly sought the art of longevity. There is a line that goes: *“At Nanjin Port once more, I meet Patriarch Lü’s boat.”* His grandson later displayed a portrait of the Yellow-Robed Elder painted by his ancestor—its purity and severity were beyond the common world.\n\nThe Daoist Hui\nDongbin traveled to Changsha, again disguised as the Daoist Hui.",

      "translated_text": "With a small clay jar, he begged for coins. Though he kept no tally, the jar never filled. People marveled at this. One day, seated by the roadside, he declared, *“Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall receive the Dao.”* People vied to toss money in, yet the jar remained unfilled. A monk, pushing a cartload of coins in jest, asked, *“Could your jar hold all this?”* The Daoist assented. As the cart was pushed in, a grating sound arose—then all vanished. The monk exclaimed, *“Are you a divine immortal or a master of illusion?”* The Daoist improvised a poem:\n\n*Neither god nor immortal,\nNeither art nor illusion.\nHeaven and earth have their end,\nMulberry fields shift and change.\nThe body was never truly mine,\nNor wealth worth clinging to.\nWhy not follow me,\nRiding the whale through boundless skies?*\n\nThe monk, increasingly bewildered, sought to seize him. The Daoist said, *“If you regret these coins, I shall repay you now.”* He took a slip of paper, cast it into the jar, and invoked, *“Push the cart out swiftly.”* After a long wait, nothing emerged. *“I must retrieve it myself,”* he said, leaping into the jar. Silence fell. The monk shattered the jar, finding only a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:\n\n*To seek the true, first know the true,\nYet seeing it, you fail to grasp.\nWe’ll meet again with a laugh,\nAs I drive my cart down a level road.*\n\nThe monk returned in dismay. Later, on the road to Pinglu, he suddenly saw the Daoist. *“I have awaited you long,”* the Daoist said, returning the cart with all its coins intact. *“I am Patriarch Lü. I once thought you teachable, but your attachment to money proves otherwise.”* The monk, filled with remorse, could only apologize too late.\n\nHe also wandered as a Daoist at Taiping Abbey.\n\n**The Recluse Hui**\nPalace Attendant Jia Shixiong of the Ministry of Works kept an ancient iron mirror and wished to temper and polish it. Lü Dongbin, calling himself the Recluse Hui, visited and requested to test its edge. From his bamboo staff, he took a pinch of powder, sprinkled it on the mirror, and departed, saying, *“I shall return with more.”* When pursued, he had vanished. Only at his lodging in Taiping Temple did they find a poem inscribed on the door:\n\n*In my hand, a green serpent gleams beneath the sun,\nIn the cave, immortal fruits bloom with eternal spring.\nKnow this: the traveler beyond the mist and clouds\nIs no mere mortal polishing mirrors in the dust.*\n\nUpon inspection, the powder on the mirror had vanished, leaving only a spot of luminous jade-like radiance.\n\n**The Mountain Man Hui**\nOn the nineteenth day of the eighth month in the first year of the Xining era, he met Shen Shan of Donglin in Huzhou, who called himself the Mountain Man Hui. Using pomegranate bark, he wrote a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*My western neighbor, though rich, frets over want,\nMy eastern elder, though poor, delights in sufficiency.\nI brew white wine to welcome green-clad guests,\nAnd scatter gold to gather books.*\n\nHe was also called the Old Man Hui, as noted in the later entry on his visit to Shi Guojian.\n\n**Hui the Later Nurturer**\nLü Dongbin traveled to Tianqing Abbey in Qinzhou. At the time, all the Daoist clergy had departed for a neighboring prefecture’s ritual feast, leaving only a young acolyte behind. Dongbin sought a brush to inscribe the wall, but the boy declined, citing the abbey’s recent renovation and the master’s prohibition against defacing the walls. *“Then,”* Dongbin said, *“kindly tend the brazier in the hall of worship; I wish to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.”* After he left, the boy saw the clear, still waters of the pond behind the hall. With a melon, Dongbin traced characters on the wall:\n\n*The stone pond’s limpid water mirrors my heart,\nYet peach blossoms’ shadows plunge it into depth.\nOnce within the palace halls of Bangshan,\nI quiet my thoughts with the seven-stringed zither.*\n\nAt the end, he signed: *Hui the Later Nurturer*. The inscription was so high no hand could have reached it. The assembly marveled, realizing *Hui* was Lü, and *Later Nurturer* was the master’s reversal of his own name.\n\n**The Valley Guest**\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, a Daoist in the Eastern Capital called himself the Valley Guest. He drank with the commoner Teng Zhong, and upon parting, left him a pellet of medicine. Teng, who had long suffered from wind-induced ailments, was cured upon taking it. Two years later, in Yangzhou, Teng encountered the Valley Guest again by the east side of Kaiming Bridge. Seated by the water, the Daoist beckoned him. Teng took the road, crossed the bridge, and hurried over—only to find no trace of him. He then realized it had been Lü Dongbin. Disappointed, he soon passed away.\n\nEarlier, he had swallowed an axle and inscribed a poem; later, in Tanzhou, he lodged at an inn, both times calling himself the Valley Guest.\n\n**The Keeper of the Valley**\nCui Zhongju, having passed the imperial examinations, was traveling through Baling when he stayed at a roadside inn. There, he sang the lyric *“Spring in the Qin Garden.”* Lü Dongbin, who had come to mend sandals in the marketplace, asked about the song. *“What melody is this?”* Cui replied, *“A new tune from the Eastern Capital.”* *“I cannot write,”* Dongbin said, *“inscribe the lyrics for me.”* Cui complied, transcribing the words:\n\n*Sevenfold cyclical elixir,\nA hundredfold myriad transformations...*\n\nWhen Cui asked his name, Dongbin said, *“I was born by the river’s mouth, grew up by the mountain’s mouth—now I am the Keeper of the Valley.”* The next morning, Cui informed the prefect, saying, *“This is Lü Dongbin.”* The prefect hastily ordered his summoning. They knocked at his door, but the response grew fainter with each call. When no answer came, they forced the door open—only to find the room empty. On the wall was a poem:\n\n*The infant in my belly is fully nurtured,\nSo I dwell in the bustling market to amuse myself.\nYet some meddling scholar prattles on,\nAnd I retreat into the depths of white clouds.*\n\nCui and the prefect could only sigh in regret.\n\n**Chang Xuzhong**",

      "translated_text": "During the reign of Emperor Huizong, a Daoist calling himself Chang Xuzhong frequented the various jade palaces. His movements were strange and unpredictable—he could drink wine without limit, devour raw fish and meat by the dozens of pounds, and down dozens of *hu* of cold water. Once, when snow blanketed the ground seven or eight *chi* deep, he buried himself in it and remained there for ten days without emerging. When the snow cleared, he rose and walked across the surface of deep pools as if treading solid ground. He was also skilled in cursive script, his strokes resembling withered vines or drifting silk, flowing in unbroken strands of thousands at a stroke. People vied to bring him paper, begging for his calligraphy, but he never obliged.\n\nThe character *Chang* in his name, *Xuzhong*, was part of the character *Lü*—for he was none other than Lü the Carefree Elder.\n\nAt Hengpu on Mount Dayu, there lived a wealthy man’s son who, enamored of the Dao, built a hermitage and hosted wandering Daoists for many years. One day, as a grand Yellow Register fasting ritual concluded, a ragged Daoist arrived seeking alms. The crowd, indifferent, even mocked and insulted him. The Daoist inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall:\n\n*Passing through Dayu,\nWho speaks with the white crane that flies here?\nBy the ridge-side homes,\nHow many times have I seen the winter plum bloom?\nSpring comes, spring goes,\nI stand where falling flowers meet flowing waters.\nBlossoms fill the path ahead,\nHiding immortals where none know.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote: *The Carefree Elder comes*—rendering the five characters in three distinct styles. Having finished, he entered the cloud hall and did not reappear. When they went to look, he had vanished; only his calligraphy remained, the ink seeping through to the other side of the wall. Then they realized that *Chang* without its heart was *Lü*—it was Lord Lü! The crowd sighed in remorse.\n\nThe Ailing Carefree One\n\nBy the great river in Jishui County, Jiangxi, stood the Xuantan Abbey. One day, all the Daoists descended the mountain to perform rituals, leaving only a young novice behind. A Daoist in a blue headscarf and white robe arrived, walking unhurriedly, and sought lodging. The novice, citing his master’s absence, refused. The Daoist asked for a brush and inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n*Lifting my robes, I seek a true host,\nThe pure scene of this night leaves me unsatisfied in song.\nThe moon hangs over the cold pool, the wind sighs in the pines—\nWhy need I the thirty-six grotto-heavens?*\n\nSigning it *The Ailing Carefree One*, he tossed the brush aside and departed. The next day, the master returned, and the novice recounted the Daoist’s request and poem. The Daoists went to see the calligraphy—its strokes were ethereal and extraordinary. Peering into the room, they found the ink had bled through the wall. Only then did they realize it was the brush of the Pure Yang Patriarch. In the thirty-ninth year of the Jiajing era, a great flood swept through, collapsing the abbey—but the wall bearing the poem stood firm, its plaster unchipped. Witnesses marveled, and a local magnate forcibly took it. As they carried it away, halfway over a ridge, it tumbled onto the rocks. To this day, traces of plaster and ink remain.\n\nMaster Bin the Dharma Master\n\nAt the Zhangren Abbey on Mount Qingcheng, Huang Ruogu was a man of refined bearing, strict discipline, and spotless conduct. He often healed the sick with celestial incantations, talismanic water, and the Three Luminaries’ Black Rite, achieving remarkable results. Yet whatever wealth he received, he immediately distributed to the poor.\n\nLü Dongbin once disguised himself as Master Bin and paid him a visit, staying for over a month. The talismans he drew would, when blown upon, transform into dragons, serpents, clouds, and mist, flying off to exorcise demons and summon generals, who would manifest in visible form. He could converse with spirits, stamp his foot to summon thunder, blink to flash lightning, exhale to form clouds, and spit to bring rain. He was also skilled in painting without brush or ink—merely holding water in his mouth and spraying it onto paper or silk, where mountains, rivers, flowers, trees, palaces, birds, beasts, and figures would naturally appear, needing only a light touch to refine them. Whenever he sold a painting, he would buy wine and drink heartily with Ruogu. Ruogu, though a heavy drinker, was always bested by Bin.\n\nOne day, Ruogu asked, “Master, your conduct is unlike that of ordinary men—you must have come from among the immortals. Can you speak to me of the Dao?”\n\nBin replied, “The seven stars of the Northern Dipper on your left foot are missing one—how can you achieve the Dao? You have but one lifetime left.”\n\nRuogu was astonished. “Master Bin must be a sage!” For on the sole of his left foot was a birthmark shaped like the Northern Dipper, with one star missing—a fact no one had ever known.\n\nRuogu then asked how long he would live. Dongbin wrote ninety-four characters backward on the wall, enclosing them in two interlocking circles, and took his leave. Only later did Ruogu realize the two circles formed the character *Lü*, while *Bin* was his surname. He died at forty-nine, just as the reversed writing had foretold.\n\nThe Fellow Guest\n\nDuring the Xining era, there was a man in Jiangnan who called himself Master Li, the Fellow Guest.",

His voice was clear and stirring, as though echoing from the azure heavens. The lyrics went:\n\n*\"In Jiangnan’s second month, the mountain paths by rivers lie,\nLi flowers scatter—spring has lost its guide.\nA single fish finds no place to hide,\nWind and rain forge scales on the jade dragon’s side—\nIt ascends to heaven’s tide.\"*\n\nIf offered money, he would refuse; if offered wine, he would not decline.

As his boat docked at the Southern Ford of Baling at dusk, he suddenly saw another vessel pass by. On board stood a yellow-robed elder with an extraordinary countenance, gazing intently at Zhongshan for a long while. Zhongshan noticed that the cabin held nothing else—only ten black jars on the bow and two blue-clad youths standing unevenly before the awning. Assuming the elder would cross directly, the boat instead rowed only two *zhang* or so before turning back, and the yellow-robed figure had already resumed his seat behind the cabin. He stared at Zhongshan once more for a long time before the vessel vanished without a trace. Zhongshan had initially thought him a wealthy merchant and had not spoken to him; now, he was suddenly struck with awe, realizing he had encountered an immortal.\n\nThe next morning, Zhongshan visited Lüxian Temple to pay his respects. The true image of the deity was indeed clad in yellow, with two blue-clad youths standing by his side. His appearance was an exact match to the elder he had seen the day before. Zhongshan lamented his mortal eyes for failing to recognize a true immortal, and his sighs knew no end. He composed a *Shuidiao Getou* lyric, including the line: *\"Again, at the Southern Ford’s port, I met Lord Lü’s boat.\"*\n\nThe following year, Zhongshan passed away.

      "translated_text": "Minister Ding remarked to his companion from Poyang that when Dongbin and a certain scholar came to pay their respects, Dongbin said: \"I am a descendant of Lü Wei of the Tang. The classics, histories, and all schools of thought—I have mastered them all.\" He then told Minister Ding that his appearance greatly resembled that of Li Deyu, and that his future rise and fall would mirror his as well. Later, Minister Ding indeed rose to the highest office before being exiled beyond the seas—truly, he lived up to the likeness of Zhaorong.\n\n**An Audience with Minister of State Zhang**\nIn his early years, Minister Zhang Ji resided at home. Dongbin visited him and discussed the *Book of Changes* with him, as well as the essence of *Mencius* on preserving the mind and nurturing qi. Zhang’s literary skills flourished thereafter. Dongbin asked for brush and paper and wrote a poem in clerical script, subtly hinting at his future role as a pillar of state. The closing lines read: *\"Success shall come in the year of breaking melons.\"* Zhang later became Minister of State and died sixteen years thereafter. The common saying that \"breaking melons\" refers to the age of sixteen proved to be a prophecy.\n\n**An Audience with the Prefect of Wuchang**\nOne day, the Prefect of Wuchang was playing chess with a companion when a Daoist, who refused to give his name, approached and said: \"I am a master of the game.\" The Prefect tested him, and after only eight moves, the Daoist declared: \"You have lost, Prefect.\" The Prefect replied: \"The board is not yet full—how can you claim I have lost?\" The Daoist said: \"My pieces have already secured the key positions; thus, I know.\" As predicted, the Prefect lost several games in succession. The Daoist then brushed his sleeves and vanished. The Prefect sent men throughout the city to search for him and heard that he was playing a flute in front of the prefectural yamen.

At the South Gate, it was heard at the North Gate. At the North Gate, it came from the Yellow Crane Tower. The Daoist hurried to the Stone Reflection Pavilion, where he disappeared.

As evening fell, Wang poured wine and asked where the adept was from. In response, the adept recited:\n\n*\"The immortal roster bears names in orderly ranks,*\n*A weary traveler from Penglai—Master Lü.*\n*How much can mortal eyes perceive?*\n*Less than the old tree spirit south of the city.\"*\n\nWang was astonished and looked up, but the adept had vanished.

My studies are confined to the *Zhuangzi* and the *Daodejing*—nothing more.\" Shi remarked: \"Zhongnan has fine places.\" The woodcutter replied: \"Indeed, many.\" He then recited a poem by Tao Hongjing:\n\n*\"What does Zhongnan possess?*\n*Only white clouds.*\n*Enough to delight oneself,*\n*But not to bestow upon you.\"*\n\nStruck by this, Shi warmly detained him for two days, engaging in profound discourse on transcending being and non-being, life and death.

Presently, a novice emerged. Lü asked why it was so empty. The boy replied, “Do not call it empty—it is the Void itself.” Pleased by his words, Dongbin inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n*The abbot’s door stands ever ajar,*\n*A barefoot boy appears from afar.*\n*I ask why the hall lies so still—*\n*He says it is Void, yet Void it ne’er fills.*\n\nHearing this, how could one not rejoice?\nThe master here is no common voice.\nI came to pay my respects, yet none were found—\nThirst unquenched, my heart stirs dust from the ground.\n\nI depart now, waves vast and wide,\nThe path to Penglai fades in the tide.\nOnce I ascend the stone tower’s height,\nSnow clears, the sea gleams—dawn breaks o’er peaks bright.\n\n**A Dream at Lushan Temple**\nAt Kaiyuan Temple on Mount Lu, the monk Fazhen had sat in meditation for twenty years, his precepts unbroken. One day, as he sat in samadhi, a Daoist appeared and asked, “Master, do you believe the Dao is found only in sitting?”\n\n“Yes,” Fazhen replied.\n\nThe Daoist said, “The Buddha’s precepts demand vigilance. Even in sitting, you claim this mind is absent—but lust and killing are grave matters. When you encounter sights or things, can you truly restrain yourself? Then this mind scatters, untamed by the Dao. Is the Way confined to sitting alone?”\n\nHe led Fazhen through the cloud hall, where a monk lay fast asleep. “Let us sit here awhile and observe,” the Daoist said. After some time, a small snake, over three inches long, emerged from the sleeping monk’s crown. It slithered down the bedpost to the floor, devouring spittle and snot before circling the chamber pot to drink. Then it glided outside, crossed a ditch, and coiled around a flower bed as if pausing to eat. Attempting to cross another small ditch, it recoiled at the overflowing water and turned back. As it approached, the Daoist thrust a small blade into the earth to block its path. The snake shrank back, then wound its way to the bed’s right leg and reentered the monk’s crown.\n\nThe monk awoke with a start and greeted the Daoist and Fazhen. “I just had a dream,” he said. “Let me tell you both. First, I left through the left gate and found a fine feast, which I ate. Then I came upon fine wine and drank my fill. Lifting my robe, I crossed a small river outside the gate, where I saw dozens of beautiful women and gazed at them freely. I tried to cross another small river, but the water had risen too high. A bandit appeared, threatening to kill me, so I fled by a shortcut and reentered through the right gate—then I awoke.”\n\nThe Daoist and Fazhen laughed. “The bedpost was your gate,” the Daoist said, “the spittle and snot your feast, the urine your wine. The ditch was your river, the flowers and trees your women, and the blade your bandit. Such are the illusions of human dreams.”\n\nFazhen asked, “What of the snake?”\n\nThe Daoist replied, “This monk’s nature is venomous and cunning. Its influence has transformed him into a serpent’s form. One day, when he closes his eyes in death, he will be reborn as a snake. Should he not fear this?” Then he turned to Fazhen: “I am Lü.

      "translated_text": "At Kaiyuan Temple in Yuanzhou, the bathhouse held a great well whose spring water was sweet and crisp. Dongbin grew fond of it and lingered for ten days. He befriended a monk there, who, simple and rustic, treated him with utmost respect, unaware that he was Dongbin. Before leaving, Dongbin gave the monk two ingots of ink as a parting gift, which the monk stored in a bamboo basket and thought no more of. One day, Li Dalin, the transport commissioner, passed through Yuanzhou on an inspection tour of Jiangxi. He sought out the monk and asked, “Did Master Lü ever give you gold?” The monk, startled, replied, “I do not know Master Lü. Some time ago, a Daoist stayed here and gave me ink, but no gold.” He produced the ink to show Li, only to find it had turned to gold. Li rubbed it in astonishment and offered to exchange it for other gold, but the monk refused, gifting him one ingot instead. He then asked how the commissioner had learned of this. Li said, “Yesterday, I passed through Lingmu and saw Immortal He. I asked after Master Lü’s whereabouts, and she said, ‘Recently, Lü passed through here and mentioned he had stayed in Yichun for some time, befriending a monk at Kaiyuan Temple’s bathhouse. He admired the monk’s immortal bearing and Daoist spirit, so he left him gold.’ Hearing this, I came to verify it.” Ten days later, Dongbin returned and asked the monk where the ink was. The monk recounted all that had happened. Dongbin laughed and said, “That woman talks too much.” Then, taking the monk by the hand, he left through the gate, and no one knew where they went.\n\n**Feast at Dayun Temple**\nDongbin, disguising himself as the recluse Hui, visited Dayun Temple and joined the communal meals. After a month, he said to the monks, “The monks here are quite refined, but you lack a bit of fine tea.” He departed, and ten days later returned with a small amount of tea. He prepared it himself, and the hundreds of monks all ate and drank their fill. The monks invited the recluse to share tea, reciting a verse by Minister Ding Jin: *“Flowers break along the monk’s sinew, / buds round as a guest’s cup.”* The recluse said, “The lines are fine, but they do not capture the essence of tea.” He then wrote a poem:\n*“The jade-tipped bud is peerless,\nthe monks’ craft in its making unmatched.\nRabbit-fur cups, shallow and fragrant, clouds of white,\nshrimp-eye bubbles churn in rippling waves.\nIt banishes the demon of sleep from desk and mat,\ninfuses the flesh with pure qi.\nThe hidden groves grow wild beyond the mountain streams,\nunwilling to transplant their roots to the capital.”*\nHe left the monks with a single cinnabar pill, saying, “Take this, and you will not die.” Then he departed. Later, the monks too ascended as immortals.\n\n**The Enchantress at the Mountain Temple**\nDongbin once wandered to a mountain temple, where he transformed his sword into a ravishing woman who entered the temple. The monks gawked, their spirits scattered and wills undone. As she passed the meditation hall, one monk sat in full lotus, eyes unturned. She left the temple, appearing unmoved. Dongbin thought him teachable, but upon exiting the gate, he found the monk already waiting in a secluded spot, his intentions plain—eager to intercept and seduce her.",

His brows and eyes were finely wrought, his countenance strange and archaic, unlike the images commonly circulated. Above his head shone the seven great stars of the Northern Dipper, while a celestial sovereign and minister stood with unbound hair, holding jade tablets. Beside them, he inscribed a talisman over a *zhang* in length, writing: *“Painted in the second year of Yuanyou. If you know where my brush began, you may speak with me of the Dao.”* Those who scraped off the talisman and ingested it to cure illness often found swift recovery. Some even beheld a divine figure of imposing presence, who declared, *“I am the Spirit of the Shen Guang Talisman.”* Complaints of its exposure to the elements were met with the construction of a thatched shelter.\n\n**Visiting Friends at Pingdu Abbey**\nIn the prefecture of Zhongzhou, Sichuan, lies Mount Pingdu, where the Han immortals Wang Fangping of the Former Han and Yin Changsheng of the Later Han once sought the Dao together in reclusion.

The Patriarch Lü visited twice, leaving behind a poem:\n\n*On the morning of Ullambana, I passed through Pingdu—*\n*No mountain under heaven compares.*\n*Two solitary travelers, unknown to all,*\n*Wang and Yin’s empty stirrups mocked the clatter of hooves.*\n\nA second poem reads:\n*At first cry, a white crow emerged from Qingcheng;*\n*Again I called upon my two friends, Wang and Yin.*\n*...I long only for the Isles of the Blest,*\n*Yet my gaze has already swept past Dongting’s spring.*\n\n**Poems at Taiping Abbey**\nAt Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, a Daoist of lofty aspirations dwelled. Dongbin, upon visiting, presented him with a poem:\n\n*A ruined genius, Master Xue,*\n*Advanced in years yet beardless still.*\n*Amid clouds, he idly shifts a stone;*\n*Within mountains, he seeks an ancient stele.*\n*He boasts of my great wine,*\n*Scorns others’ petty verse.*\n*What manner of man is this?*\n*Let the rabble sneer as they will.*\n\nAt the end, he inscribed in small script: *“The Returning Daoist, with three companions, visited Alchemist Xue.”* Only then was it known that “Dongbin” was but one of his sobriquets.\n\n**Poems at Tianqing Abbey**\nAt Tianqing Abbey in Fuli County, Suzhou, a young Daoist named Yu studied the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi* with rare insight. One morning, a traveling medicine peddler arrived—none other than Dongbin. His bearing was majestic, and he lingered for over a month, imparting the essentials of the Lao-Zhuang tradition to the Daoist: *“I have observed that Chan teachings all derive from Laozi and Zhuangzi. Though they spin myriad sutras and endless discourses, erecting their own schools and tracing lineages of transmission, in truth, all return to the principles of Lao-Zhuang.”* Before departing, he inscribed two quatrains on the door in large seal script, the strokes soaring and dynamic:\n\n*Autumn’s scene—withered vines, scattered leaves in flight,*\n*Beneath the pine’s shadow, I sit as time drifts by.*\n*Clouds obscure the crane-drawn chariot—where has it gone?*\n*The immortal’s morning audience at the grotto has passed me by.*\n\n*From the elbow, the thousand-year art of cinnabar talismans is passed;*\n*From the mouth, the two scrolls of the* Huangting *are recited.*\n*Within the crane’s abode, by the ancient altar’s pine-shadowed silence,*\n*No footfall stirs—only the door, left ajar for long.*\n\nAfter he left, people scraped off the characters to cure illnesses, often with remarkable success. The ink had penetrated over an inch into the wood, yet its edges remained unfaded.\n\n**Poems at Tianqing Abbey in Shanzhou**\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Lü Huiqing governed Shanzhou’s Tianqing Abbey. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a stranger passed through and inscribed two poems on paper:\n\n*A lone wanderer across the four seas,*\n*Two gourds of frost and snow suffice for spirit.*\n*If you have gathered the two principles of Kan and Li,*\n*Let the dragon-tiger elixir circulate mercury.*\n\n*A wanderer, I was once a guest of Tiantai;*\n*South of the stone bridge lies my old dwelling.*\n*...*",

The monks gawked, their spirits scattered and wills undone. As she passed the meditation hall, one monk sat in full lotus, eyes unturned. She left the temple, appearing unmoved. Dongbin thought him teachable, but upon exiting the gate, he found the monk already waiting in a secluded spot, his intentions plain—eager to intercept and seduce her.",

One day, a Daoist named Lü arrived, demanding drink. Finding no wine, she gave him a sheng of murky dregs. When he asked the price, she said, “Twenty coins per sheng.” The Daoist pointed at the wine, inscribed twenty characters on a purple stone outside the door, and left. Upon closer inspection, the words had penetrated several *chi* into the stone. From then on, crowds gathered like a wall, and the wine shop thrived. Later, a *Jixian Abbey* was built on the site.\n\n**Yongkang Wine Tower**\nIn Yongkang Prefecture, a man named Ni opened a new wine tower. A Daoist arrived and drank from dawn till dusk, consuming over a *dan* of fine wine. The crowd marveled and gathered to watch. Ni demanded payment, but the Daoist glared in silence, then collapsed drunk. Ni kept vigil beside him. At the first drum of dawn, the Daoist suddenly rose, seized a brush, and wrote a poem on the wall:\n\n*Like a whale’s gulp or turtle’s swallow, hundreds of cups,*\n*Who raises the jade mountain, who topples it?*\n*When sober, two sleeves catch the wind’s chime—*\n*A crimson cloud rises over the sea.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote: *“Composed by Yang Chun of the Three Mountains.”* He threw a clod of earth at Ni’s face, strode out, and gazed northeast as a crimson cloud approached. Clapping his hands and laughing loudly, he vanished. When they scraped the wall, the ink had soaked several *fen* deep. The clod of earth was pure gold. From then on, the wine tower flourished. They realized Yang Chun was none other than *Pure Yang* (纯阳).\n\n**Tea Shop in Bianjing**\nAt the end of the Later Zhou, the Shi family ran a tea shop in Bianjing. Their daughter, still wearing her hair in childish loops, served the tea. Lü Dongbin disguised himself as a beggar, visiting daily to occupy the best seat and demand tea. His clothes were ragged, his flesh filthy with grime—scarcely approachable. Yet the girl showed no disgust, bringing him the finest tea. Her parents grew angry and beat her, but she served him all the more. After a month, he remained unwearied.\n\nDongbin said to her, “Can you drink the dregs of my tea?”\nShe found it too foul to swallow and poured it on the ground. Suddenly, an extraordinary fragrance arose. She hastily licked it, and her spirit felt refreshed.\n\nDongbin said, “I am Master Lü, not a beggar. It’s a pity you couldn’t finish my dregs. Still, I can grant your wish—do you desire wealth, nobility, or longevity?”\nThe girl replied, “I’m a humble girl. I don’t know what nobility is. Wealth and longevity would suffice.”\nDongbin left and never returned. Later, she gained wealth and prominence, living to one hundred thirty-five.\n\n**Rice Shop in Changxi**\nIn Changxi County, Fujian, an old woman ran a rice shop. During the Qiandao era, a Daoist arrived. After eating, he wrote on the wall with a fiery purple brush: *“Lü Dongbin came.”* The characters gleamed with strange brilliance. The prefect heard of it and rode to see, but the words had already vanished, leaving no trace—truly the brush of a divine hand.\n\n**Brothel in Yanzhou**\nIn Yanzhou, a courtesan named Hou ran a lodging house for travelers. Dongbin disguised himself and sought lodging. He left early and returned late, always drunk, and after a month had paid not a single coin. Hou summoned him for tea, but Dongbin said, “I met Master Zhongli. He said you are fit to hear the Dao.”\nHou did not understand and offered him wine. Dongbin drank without cease, and Hou grew increasingly displeased. Dongbin stretched out his arm—golden hairpins glinted beneath his sleeve. He removed one and told her to buy wine. Hou, lured by the gold, said, “Stay the night after drinking.”\n“Very well,” he replied. He climbed onto the bed, snoring loudly. At midnight, Hou approached the bed, but Dongbin pushed her away with his hand. She retreated at once. At dawn, Dongbin was gone. Examining her body, she found where his hand had touched her—*“Lü”* was etched into her skin. Hou realized with awe, “This was Lord Lü! Was it not a single misguided thought in a past life that brought me to this? Has he come to deliver me?” She cut her hair, donned coarse cloth, and set out to find Dongbin, never to be seen again.\n\n**Brothel in Guangling**\nIn Guangling, the courtesan Huang Ying was renowned for her beauty, and wealthy patrons filled her door. One day, a scholar named Lü sought lodging, but Huang rejected him for his ragged, filthy appearance. The scholar wrote two poems on her screen:\n\n*Mengmu and Xishi share this body,*\n*Alas, youth and age span a thousand springs.*\n*One day, a white-haired, wrinkled crone—*\n*Today, a jade-faced beauty in bloom.*\n\n*Flowers bloom and fall, two joys and sorrows,*\n*Flower and person share the same fate.*\n*Blooming on the branch, they fear the guest’s plucking;*\n*Fallen to the earth, who will gaze upon them?*\n\nHe finished writing and vanished in an instant.\n\n**Brothel in the Eastern Capital**\nIn the Eastern Capital, the courtesan Yang Liu was unmatched in beauty. A Daoist frequented her home, often leaving gold and silk, yet never slept with her. One night, drunk, she pressed him, but the Daoist said, “I have united Kan and Li within my body. Husband and wife join internally, the sacred embryo is formed, the infant is about to be born—how could I still desire external beauty? The joy of inner union far surpasses that of outer union.”\nYang was astonished by his words. At the time, the prime minister Zhang Tianjue and his guest Xiao were her longtime patrons. She told Xiao, who relayed it to Zhang. They rushed to her quarters. The Daoist cried out and fled, heading straight for the Cloud-Abiding Hermitage’s meditation hall, where he shut himself in. After a long search, they found him gone. Only a poem remained on the wall:\n\n*One breath shatters the phoenix flute in the Great Clarity,*\n*Green-robed youths chant the *Step of Emptiness*.*\n*The jade tower awakens a thousand-year dream—*\n*On the green peach branch, the golden parrot sings.*",

When the man was pressed for a confession, he declared himself to be Lü Dongbin, the Immortal, and wrote two poems. The first read:\n\n*A maiden fair as jade, her body soft as cream,*\n*Yet at her waist hangs a sword to slay the foolish.*\n*Though no heads roll from her blade’s swift gleam,*\n*In secret, she drains men’s marrow to the bone.*\n\nThe second poem said:\n\n*Six panels of red silk sweep the floor in grace,*\n*Yet hide a pit where men are lured to fall.*\n*Kings, ministers, and lords all meet this base—*\n*Only this master wakes, untouched by thrall.*\n\nWhen the poems were finished, he turned and vanished—revealing himself as Lü Dongbin.\n\n**Seven Accounts of Hermitages and Gatherings**\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Vegetarian Feast**\nDuring the Xuanhe era of the Song, Emperor Huizong hosted a vegetarian feast for a thousand Daoists, but one place remained unfilled.

At that moment, Huizong was conversing with the Daoist Lin Lingsu in the side hall when the leprous man suddenly appeared at the foot of the steps. The emperor hastily sent him to join the feast. The Daoist brushed his sleeve against a pillar as he left, and Huizong, finding it strange, rose to inspect it. Written in powder on the pillar were these words:\n\n*Lofty words and grand debates, as if none else were near,*\n*Alas, the enlightened lord has not met a true seer.*\n*If Your Majesty asks of the days ahead,*\n*Behold the bingwu and dingwei years of spring.*\n\nSure enough, in the jingkang years of bingwu and dingwei, the two emperors were captured in the northern calamity.\n\n**The Crane Gathering at Mount Qingcheng**\nAt the end of the Shaoxing era, Lü Dongbin attended the Crane Gathering at Mount Qingcheng.

When the assembly dispersed, he hung the hat upon the wall—though nothing held it, it did not fall. He inscribed a poem:\n\n*By chance I rode the Azure Emperor from Penglai,*\n*My sword and halberd gleaming through the Nine Realms.*\n*Though I stand before your eyes, none recognize me—*\n*I leave this hat behind, lest it sink into oblivion.*\n\n**The Feast Hosted by Minister Jia**\nLady Liangguo, mother of Minister Jia, prepared a feast for wandering Daoists. Suddenly, a group of Daoists arrived, escorting a pregnant woman about to give birth. Before the feast concluded, the woman delivered her child upon the ground. The Daoists then helped her depart, leaving only the infant behind. When the guests lifted the child, they found it was a sword sheath—realizing then that Lord Lü had played a trick on the common folk.\n\n**The White Cloud’s Lodging**\nIn Jizhou, the White Cloud Hall stood near Longqing Temple. Once, a Daoist lodged there, his throat bearing a second mouth with which he blew an iron flute. When he finished, he sealed the opening with paper. Upon his hat were inscribed two lines:\n\n*A single note blown beyond the slanting sun,*\n*Awakens the rivers and lakes of a thousand miles.*\n\nChildren trailed behind him, and he would scatter copper coins upon the ground, letting them scramble for the money. Later, he left a poem on the rear hall’s wall:\n\n*The Herdboy and Weaver Girl,*\n*As ever, in the White Lotus Hall.*\n\nThen he departed, leaving all puzzled by his meaning. Later, when the rebel Li Yuanhao of Meizhou rose in revolt, the White Cloud Hall barred its doors to lodgers, fearing spies. Three years later, it reopened—on the day after the Seventh Night. Only then did they grasp the poem’s meaning, and realize the two mouths formed the character *Lü*.\n\n**Lodging at Jiangzhou**\nAt the ritual platform of Pacification Commissioner Pan in Ruichang County, Jiangzhou, a Daoist arrived seeking lodging. He carried no bundle, no umbrella—only a tattered bamboo hat, dressed in rustic rags. The hall attendant scorned him: *\"With no umbrella, no bundle, how can you lodge here?\"* The Daoist replied: *\"If you refuse me lodging, then grant me a cup of tea before I go.\"* The attendant went inside, bidding him sit, but upon returning, found the Daoist seated in the host’s place. Enraged, the attendant cried: *\"Ignorant of guest and host, what sort of Daoist are you?\"* The Daoist departed without a bow, leaving his hat behind. The attendant could not lift it. Only after gathering the assembly to chant sutras and offer apologies could they raise the hat, beneath which the ground bore the character *Lü*. Those afflicted with illness took the earth, brewed it into a decoction, and were instantly cured. Over the years, a well formed there, its bubbling surface naturally shaping the character *Lü*.

      "translated_text": "Governor Zhao Yingdao oversaw the Wensi Institute when a personal attendant fell gravely ill with sores and convulsions, deemed beyond cure. The man came to bid farewell to the institute’s officials, saying to his disciples: *\"I shall die any day now. My aged mother will be left with no one to rely on—what is to be done?\"* The assembly tried to console him, some weeping in sympathy. As he stepped outside, a Daoist followed him and, after a short distance, said: *\"Your sores are easily healed.\"* He instructed the man to buy two sheets of paper, then scratched two square openings into them, each about three inches across, and handed them over, saying: *\"Burn one sheet tonight, grind the ashes, and mix them with frankincense decoction to apply as a poultice. Keep the other for others in need.\"* The man returned home, applied the medicine as directed, and lay down. Upon waking, he found the sores completely gone, not even a scab remaining. He rushed to the institute to recount the miracle, whereupon the others realized: *\"Two square openings—it is the character *Lü*! Could it be that his near-death plea for his mother, moved by filial devotion, drew the compassion of an immortal to save him?\"*\n\n**The Lame Man of Zhaozhou**\nA poor man named Liu in Zhaozhou had suffered from lameness for twenty years. Each evening, he burned incense at his hearth and prayed to Heaven. One day, a Daoist carrying an iron ladle approached him and said: *\"Follow me.\"* Liu trailed him for about two *li* before the Daoist pointed to the ground and said: *\"Beneath here, over three feet down, lies a five-colored stone. Dig it up.\"* Liu did so and found a stone the size of a pellet, its hues extraordinary. The Daoist instructed: *\"Take it home, expose it to the sun for nine days, then grind it into fine powder. Brew it with quince peel decoction and drink. Once cured, come to the east corridor of Zhuyun Hall in the city—third room on the left—and we shall meet again.\"* Liu’s ailment vanished at once. He went to the hall and found only a mural of Lü Dongbin holding a ladle amid clouds.\n\n**The Blind Man of Jiangling**\nThe Fu family of Jiangling was poor, earning their living by making paper for rituals. Fond of wandering scholars, they welcomed all who passed, offering whatever they could, no matter how meager. The neighbors called him *\"Daoist Fu.\"* Behind his hut stood a small shrine with a statue of Lü Dongbin seated on a boulder, beside which rested an ink basket woven from mud and bamboo strips, holding several bundles of ink sticks. Morning and night, Fu burned incense in devotion. After bowing, he would bar the door, remove the ladder, and forbid even his wife and children from entering.

      "translated_text": "Fu rose and said, \"I happen to have a hundred coins—shall we go to the tavern for a drink?\" Fu followed him. From then on, the visitor came every few days, sometimes staying for wine, sometimes for a meal. Fu’s eyes were dim and wept often. The guest taught him to take equal parts of fresh and prepared *dihuang* (Rehmannia), slice and dry them, remove the seeds from Sichuan peppercorns (discarding any with closed mouths), lightly toast them, then blend all three with honey to form pills. He instructed Fu to take fifty pills on an empty stomach with salted rice broth. Fu prepared the medicine as directed, and after a month, his vision cleared—he could see by day and night.\n\nAfter half a year of visits, the guest suddenly took his leave, saying, \"In a few days, I will travel to Xiangyang. Could you accompany me west?\" Fu declined, citing his heavy burdens. The guest smiled and said, \"I knew you would not go.\" He took up a brush and wrote four characters—*Profit, Luck, Harmony, Union*—and handed them to Fu, saying, \"Post these on your shop wall, and your earnings will increase a hundredfold.\" He then pulled Fu to the tavern to drink in farewell. From his sleeve, he drew a paper packet containing several ink sticks and said, \"I intend to take these to Xiangyang as gifts. Let me leave them with you for now; I’ll retrieve them before I depart.\" After drinking, Fu returned home and placed the ink on the rack.\n\nTwo months passed, and the guest did not return. Fu opened the packet to find it was the Lü Dongbin statue—precisely the one woven from bamboo strips that had stood before the shrine. He searched the basket inside the shrine, but it was empty. Only then did he realize the guest had been Lü Dongbin, and he deeply regretted missing the encounter. He posted the four characters on the wall, and his business flourished daily. He lived to eighty-nine, his ears sharp, his eyes bright, and his vigor like that of a youth.\n\n**The Courtesan of Anfeng Cured**\nAt the end of the Yuanyou era, a courtesan named Sanxiang in Anfeng County fell gravely ill. No treatment cured her, and in her poverty, she took lodgers to support herself. One day, a poor scholar arrived seeking shelter, asking for the best room. The servant, seeing his ragged clothes, refused him, but Sanxiang said, \"Why choose between rich and poor?\" She welcomed him in. Soon after, the scholar heard her groaning in pain and asked the reason. The servant explained. The scholar said, \"I can cure this illness.\" Overjoyed, Sanxiang urged him to help. The scholar sealed her mouth with chopsticks and chanted, \"Turn your heart, turn your heart.\"\n\nAt the time, she did not understand. Outside the door stood a large, long-dead *zaojia* tree. The scholar placed a pill into a crevice in the tree, sealing it with mud. Suddenly, he vanished. That night, the tree sprouted branches and leaves, growing lush by the day. Sanxiang’s illness was instantly cured. Only then did she realize \"turn your heart\" (*hui xin*) referred to Lü (Dongbin). She abandoned her home to seek her master. The townspeople built a shrine to the Perfected One at the site.\n\nIn the fourteenth year of the Shaoxing era, Sanxiang suddenly returned to her hometown, her appearance youthful and radiant. Elders who recognized her told the prefectural governor, Wu Yi Daifu Zize, who summoned her for questioning. She refused to speak in detail, and later, her whereabouts became unknown.\n\n**Selling Medicine in Yueyang**\nLü Dongbin traveled to Yueyang, where he disguised himself and sold medicine, pricing each pill at a thousand gold pieces. After three days with no buyers, he ascended Yueyang Tower, consumed one of his own pills, and suddenly rose into the air. The crowd, astonished and envious, clamored to buy his medicine. Dongbin laughed and said, \"The Dao is before your eyes, yet you tread the paths of Penglai in vain. You grasp the trigger but do not fire—missing it even when face-to-face.\" He then recited a poem:\n\n*At dawn I roam the northern Yue, by dusk the southern Wu,*\n*My sleeve holds the green serpent, my gall bold as a tiger’s.*\n*Thrice I entered Yueyang, yet none knew me—*\n*Reciting verses, I soared over Dongting Lake.*\n\n**Offering the Elixir in Chengdu**\nAt the medicine market in Chengdu, a Daoist with a grimy face and tattered robes held up a single elixir, shouting to the crowd, \"I am Lü Dongbin! Whoever bows to me twice may have this pill.\" The people thought him mad and followed, laughing. The Daoist walked back and forth several times, but no one bowed. He then sat by the large pond in front of the Wuxian Temple. Children pelted him with tiles and stones, but he only smiled and said, \"The world longs to see me, yet when they do, they do not recognize me. Such is fate.\"\n\nLü then consumed the golden elixir himself. Soon, five-colored clouds enveloped him, and he vanished. The crowd was filled with regret.\n\n**The Silk-Wrapped Medicine**\nDuring a year of rampant malaria in the Eastern Capital, an old woman who ran a vegetarian teahouse saw her children and grandchildren all fall ill. One day, a Daoist arrived. The woman treated him kindly and begged him to cure her family. The Daoist said, \"Wait for me tomorrow morning.\"\n\nThe next day, the woman rose early to await him. The Daoist took out a medicine wrapped in fine silk and said, \"When the illness strikes, have the afflicted hold this—all will be cured. One pill can heal a hundred people, but beyond that, it will lose its efficacy.\" The woman followed his instructions, and her family recovered. She then treated a hundred others, but once the number was exceeded, the medicine no longer worked.\n\nShe opened the silk pouch to find the medicine gone—only three characters remained: *Lü Dongbin*. Only then did she realize she had encountered Master Lü.\n\n**Saving a Mother in Xiao Gan**\nIn Tonglu, there was a *Tongshou* (official) whose name is forgotten.",

      "translated_text": "In the twentieth year of the Shaoxing reign, Maoshan conducted a grand Daoist jiao ritual. Zheng Qing, the Transport Commissioner of Jiangdong, and Wang Yiyan, a minister, went together to observe. By midday, they rested at a thatched cottage. There they met a Daoist, clad in a white ramie robe and a black cloth headscarf, with long eyebrows and a fine beard, his bearing refined and elegant. Zheng and Wang remarked to each other, \"Could this be the Immortal Lü?\" They summoned him for conversation, invited him to sit, and poured several rounds of wine, by which time both hosts were already drunk. The Daoist asked his guest, \"Can you drink more?\" The guest replied, \"I can.\" \"How much can you take?\" \"Without measure.\" Thereupon, he ordered his attendant to pour two pots of wine into a silver basin, letting the guest drink to his heart's content—one cup after another without cease. Zheng said, \"Master, if you have any elixir, I would beg a few grains.\" The Daoist replied, \"I do.\" He then reached out, scraped the grime from beneath his left armpit, rolled it into green pellets, and gave them to Zheng, saying, \"You may only inhale them, not swallow.\" Wang also asked for some, so the Daoist scraped the dirt from beneath his right armpit, formed red pellets, and gave them to him with the same instruction. When the wine was finished, the guest departed.\n\nEarlier, an old soldier had been guarding the lodging hall, while another old transport soldier lay sleeping under the eaves, not waking even as the day grew late. In jest, the transport soldier placed the two pellets into the old soldier’s nostrils. The qi was immediately drawn in, yet the old soldier remained unaware. Someone roused him and asked, \"How do your limbs feel?\" He replied, \"I feel extremely light, as if I could ascend to the clouds.\" The next day, he rose into the air and departed. The two transport officials looked at each other in regret, realizing they had missed their chance. This was but a borrowed hand to deliver the old soldier.\n\n**Encounter with the Dao: He the Immortal Maiden**\nHe Xiangu was a Daoist maiden from the market of Lingling. At thirteen, she followed her female companions into the mountains to pick tea. Suddenly, she lost her companions and wandered alone, unable to find her way home. On the path, she saw a man beneath an eastern peak—tall, with a long beard, piercing eyes, a lofty cap, and a robe of six layers: it was Lü Dongbin. The maiden prostrated herself repeatedly in haste and bowed to him. Dongbin produced a peach and said, \"You are young and must love fruit. Eat this entirely, and one day you will ascend in flight. If not, you will remain earthbound.\" The maiden could only eat half. The bearded man pointed out her way home. When she returned, she thought only a day had passed, but in truth, a month had elapsed. From then on, she neither hungered nor suffered from bodily leaks, and she could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Later, she departed through *shijie* (corpse liberation).\n\nDongbin once said to the maiden, \"I once wandered the market of Huayin selling medicine. I placed a single grain of spiritual elixir among ten thousand grains of other remedies. When someone sought medicine, I would casually scoop some from the gourd and give it to them, observing their karmic affinity. Over several days, eighty thousand grains of the other medicines were taken, yet this elixir would fall from the hand the moment it was grasped. Alas, how rare it is to encounter one with the bone structure of an immortal in this world!\"\n\n**Encounter with the Dao: Liu the Lame Immortal**\nLiu the Lame Immortal of Changsha met Dongbin on Junshan and received the method of the灵龟吞吐 (Spiritual Tortoise’s Inhalation and Exhalation). After mastering the practice, he retired to Mount Yuelu and styled himself Master of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. He often accompanied Dongbin to and from Baohuang Cave. Dongbin frequently wandered beneath the city walls and wrote a poem:\n*\"Of the seventy-two peaks of the Southern Mountains,\nI love only the cave of true emptiness.\"*\nLater, a man named Zheng Si encountered the Lame Immortal outside the Qingtai Gate, and together they ascended as immortals.\n\n**Daoist Friends Discussing Scriptures**\nChen Danran was a wealthy scholar who admired the Dao. For many years, he invited wandering Daoists to stay, yet he never encountered a true master. Dongbin disguised himself as a laborer and worked in Chen’s garden for over a year, performing tasks with strength beyond that of ordinary men. Chen grew fond of him but treated him as nothing more than a hired hand. One day, Chen and a Daoist friend were discussing the *Yinfu Jing* (Scripture of Hidden Agreement). When they reached the passage, *\"Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism; heaven and earth are overturned,\"* they could not fathom the meaning of the \"killing mechanism.\" Dongbin, standing nearby, spoke up loudly: *\"That which is born does not live; that which dies does not perish. To kill the living after it is born, or to learn death before it is absent—this is the way to long life.\"* Chen rebuked him angrily: \"Are you not a laborer? Who taught you to speak thus?\" When pressed further, Dongbin deliberately garbled his words, making them incomprehensible. The Daoist friend said, \"This rustic must have overheard such talk somewhere. He does not truly understand it.\"\n\nSoon after, Dongbin suddenly took leave of Chen, saying, \"I will travel far. I shall return on the fifth day of the fifth month next year at noon.\" After his departure, all was quiet. Later, one of Chen’s fellow townsmen was visiting Baling and encountered Dongbin, who said, \"Tell Master Chen for me: I am Lü Dongbin. At first, I thought he might be worthy of receiving the Dao, but upon closer observation, I saw otherwise. I shall not return.\" With that, he walked into the bamboo grove of the Lüxian Pavilion and vanished. On the noon of the fifth day of the fifth month the following year, Master Chen suddenly died.\n\n*Record of the Patriarch Lü, Scroll Three—concluded*\n*Record of the Patriarch Lü, Scroll Four*",

      "translated_text": "**Record of Arts and Literature**\n\n**Five Ancient Poems in *Gufeng* Style**\n\n**First Poem: A Record**\n\nFor years I delighted in seclusion’s quiet,\nSeeking escape from cold and heat’s oppression.\nI sought no fame nor profit,\nYet still feared the toil of body and mind.\nWith earnest resolve, I yearned for the *Yellow Court*,\nDiligently pursuing the traces of the Dao.\nIn secret, I cultivated hidden virtue,\nAccumulating good deeds day by day.\nAt last, upon the worldly path, I met my master—\nA man unrecognized by all.\nMy master’s movements were subtle, his conduct discreet,\nHis bearing solitary, his nature aloof.\nHe could shift the Five Phases,\nAnd alter the Four Symbols.\nHe transmitted to me the Gate of Creation,\nWhere I first grasped the principle of *Xiyi*.\nIngesting the twofold truth,\nI followed the path to its very source.\nBoiling the sun and moon in the crucible,\nNever straying from the side of Heaven and Earth.\nThe supreme Dao lies before the eyes,\nAttained in an instant, yet ever near.\nTrue emptiness is not empty,\nTrue form is not form.\nOverturning the jade gourd,\nForth flows the golden elixir.\nGrasping the Red Dragon’s head,\nI fiercely draw in the Black Pearl.\nSwallowing it into my viscera,\nI seize the power of immortals.\nA single grain of millet,\nExtends life by millions of years.\nFellow travelers, heed my song,\nAnd draw closer to the Dao.\nWithout understanding the true Yellow Sprout,\nYou wander the purple paths in vain.\nSeize the Red Crow’s soul,\nAnd burst forth the Silver Toad’s essence.\nIf you fail to fathom this mystery,\nYou will forever drift in shallow streams.\nThe Three Heavens have their paths,\nThe Nine Earths know no peril.\nGuard the Dao and feign foolishness,\nForget scheming and blend with the dust.\nLet none among the multitudes despise you—\nYou are already a guest of Penglai.\n\n**Two Ancient Poems in *Gufeng* Style**\n\n**Presented to the Recluse Liu Fang**\n\nGrieving the rise and fall of six warring states,\nI take my zither and chant, leaving the sacred land.\nI would boil white stones in mist and clouds,\nBut chance upon a city where I meet a man of the Dao.\nI have found the Golden Flower’s world-transcending guard,\nAnd hope to ride the clouds to the Purple Palace.\nIn recent years, I plucked the green jade of Yellow Cliff,\nWhere jade trees stand tall, rooted in the earth’s lungs.\nDew scatters fragrance over jasper fields, nourishing the sprouts,\nThe moon rises over emerald peaks, and cranes cry from their boats.\nThe messages of grotto-heavens run deep in spring,\nThe immortal’s path is trodden, but mortals cannot follow.\nThen, on a whim, I descended from the white clouds,\nAnd chanced upon you in this dusty world.\nIn this dusty world, our meeting was rare—\nWe spoke of ancient times and shared the same aspirations.\nWe played jade zithers and precious lutes,\nAnd drank nectar and jade wine until I grew drunk.\nIn my drunkenness, I spoke of the rise and fall of nations,\nOf how the Dao of clouds knows no worldly burdens.\nThis fleeting life is but a fleeting dream,\nLike a spark or lightning—gone in an instant.\nYouth and beauty are not eternal,\nFair faces and jade complexions return to dust.\nThe fragrant cup is refilled from dawn to dusk,\nJoy knows no end, past or present.\nHow much better to recognize the profound Dao,\nWhich lies in the unfathomable—ponder it deeply.\nWithin the crucible, a single grain transforms into a wondrous thing,\nBeyond all things, a thousand years of effort hold boundless mystery.\nIf only you can master the flower in the midst of water,\nWater and fire will reverse to form the golden elixir-tortoise.\nOnce the elixir is complete, you will not linger long among men,\nFor the celestial decree of the azure skies awaits.\nThe sunlit valleys of the Mystic Continent are yours to dwell in,\nWhere earthly longevity and heavenly years are eternally preserved.\nPhoenix carriages and crane-drawn chariots soar through the clouds,\nThe distant Jasper Pool is easily reached.\nI hear of wars and collapses,\nI see beauty wither into decay.\nThe old lands of the Tang lie in ruins,\nThe tombs of the Han are overgrown with white grass.\nThis world of clashing shells is truly sorrowful—\nCherish your life, do not delay.\nPearls and jades filling your house bring no blessing,\nSilks and satins overflowing your chests invite only peril.\nThe wise have long warned against greed,\nThe enlightened forget desire—why wait?\nLiu Fang, Liu Fang, heed my words:\nTime flies swift as a passing shadow.\nSever the roots of yin’s entanglements with resolve,\nFor the corpse-ghost’s procrastination will be your undoing.\nYou already know the Eight Jade Secrets—\nDo not wait until the cart is broken and the axle snapped.\nA broken cart and snapped axle demand alarm—\nEven meeting Boyang would be too late.\nWorrying endlessly for home and country,\nYou exhaust the primordial fire of the Three Fields.\nThe Gate of Mystery lies within reach—\nUnlock the golden lock yourself.\n\n**Presented to Qiao Erlang**\n\nSince we met in the imperial capital,\nWe have been drunk year after year.\nIn our drunkenness, we often cherished the truth,\nCaring little for fame or profit.\nI urge you to abandon fleeting glory,\nAnd hasten toward the misty paths of the Dao.\nBut how to embark on this misty journey?\nFirst, you must make the golden essence fly from behind your elbow.\nWhen the golden essence flies to the Upper Palace,\nThe Upper and Lower Palaces will be filled with light.\nThen, the jade drops will trickle to a halt,\nRushing back to the primordial sea like thunder.\nEven if husband and wife meet again,\nTheir joy will be boundless, their love without end.\nWater and fire will be balanced,\nAnd the hanging moment will reverse into Heaven and Earth in harmony.\nAs yang refines yin through rising and sinking,\nOnly when yin is exhausted will you grasp this profound truth.\nWhat, after all, is the root and origin?\nClearly, it is but gold within water.\nQiao, Qiao, act swiftly—\nDo not chase the flying crow or the running hare.\nHow much better to cultivate and become a true immortal,\nFor this floating life in the dusty world will not last.\nThe great Dao of long life is not easily attained—\nFrom ancient times to now, it has always been so.\n\n**Four Quatrains in Five-Character Style**\n\n**Presented to Li Xiyu of Qizhou**\n\nDrink less wine that deceives the heart,\nAnd never covet unjust wealth.\nBlessings come from kindness,\nDisaster strikes the cunning and deceitful.\n\n**Inscribed at the Purple Ultimate Palace**\n\nEntering the palace gate in leisure,\nI lean on the railing by the water.\nNo one knows I have come—\nOnly the red-crested crane cries urgently.\n\n**Presented to the Recluse Shen Zhenji (Two Poems)**\n\nOn the crane’s back, I sing a long song,\nIts clear notes echoing through the forest.\nA thousand miles away, Dongting’s autumn—\nLake waves play with the bright moon.\n\nThe moon has already turned pale,\nMy poem complete as dawn approaches.\nSuddenly, the lone crane vanishes,\nAnd idle clouds drift away.\n\n**Eighteen Regulated Verses in Five-Character Style**\n\nHaving awakened to the principle of long life,\nAutumn lotuses bloom everywhere.\nThe Golden Lad ascends the brocade canopy,\nThe Jade Maiden descends the fragrant steps.\nWhen the tiger roars, the celestial soul abides,\nWhen the dragon chants, the earthly spirit comes.\nWhoever understands this Dao\nInstantly returns to infancy.\n\nThe Alchemical Maiden dwells in the south,\nBeside her, the Great Sun is born.\nIn the Toad Palace, jade liquid is boiled,\nAt the Kan Gate, jade nectar is refined.\nThe immortals of the past consumed it—\nNow it is my turn to taste.",

restoration ends.\nAwakened, the fish leaps into water,\nDeluded, the crow remains in the cage.\nAt advanced age, take one pill,\nAnd instantly transform into a soaring youth.\n\nDao and virtue are the ancestors of heaven and earth,\nYin and yang their root lineage.\nThe celestial soul births the White Tiger,\nThe earthly spirit yields the Azure Dragon.\nConvey the treasure to lodge in the Mud Pill,\nTransfer the essence into the Upper Palace.\nWhoever understands this method\nWill retain a youthful countenance for ten thousand years.\n\nTo seek the principle of the Golden Elixir,\nThe root origin is not easily found.\nThe Three Powers fulfill the sevenfold return,\nThe Four Images complete the ninefold restoration.\nBathed, it becomes faintly white,\nBurnished, gradually red.\nOne pill extends ten thousand ages,\nBeyond the world, one ascends in boundless flight.\n\nEach seeks long life,\nYet the root origin is not easily found.\nTo covet the treasure of heaven,\nOne must forsake worldly riches.\nRefine the fire within water,\nBurn the yin within yang.\nThe Patriarch’s own words:\nA single taste of gold within water.\nAll things are born of jade,\nAs humans attain their root origin.\nThe essence of the Azure Dragon is mercury,\nThe White Tiger’s water is lead.\nThe awakened child returns to the mother,\nThe deluded mistake earth for heaven.\nThose who come as guests beyond the world\nEach replenish their cinnabar field.\nThe twenty-four spirits purified,\nThe three thousand merits accomplished.\nCold clouds stretch across the earth,\nThe sacred sun fills the sky.\nThe Jade Lad is fit for planting,\nThe Golden Field need not be tilled.\nWithin this true and wondrous principle,\nWho says one cannot attain long life?\n\nLayer upon layer of gauze,\nMystery

      "translated_text": "Alone I ascend the high peak to gaze upon the Eight Capitals,\nBlack clouds disperse, the moon remains solitary.\nBoundless the cosmos, numberless its people—\nHow many men among them are true husbands?\n\nRoaming all under heaven takes but half a day’s work,\nNo need to ride phoenix or mount dragon.\nBy chance in a game of chance, my spirit-sword takes flight,\nShattering the first peak of Mount Zhongnan.\n\nI overturn the gourd, strike aside the zither,\nWalking backward, I ascend beyond Oxherd Summit.\nWater flies from stone, bursting like snow,\nStanding I gaze at heaven, sitting I chant.\n\nMy home was originally at Heaven’s Pivot,\nScattered like drifting white clouds, melting the stone steps.\nComing and going eight thousand leagues consumes half a day,\nYet the old return path remains unlost.\n\nThe Daoist of Yellow Peak is lofty and pure,\nHe does not descend from the Lotus Palace for years.\nBy night he bows to stars, his jade hairpin chilled,\nBy dawn the dragon and tiger stir, the golden crucible hot.\n\nSuddenly we meet by the eastern mountainside,\nGrasping hands, we exhort each other, voices ringing like bells.\n“Your swordcraft is complete—take it with you,\nWhere dragons dwell, there slay dragons.”\n\nAt dawn I sail to Cangwu, by dusk I return,\nWithin the grotto, sun and moon—here I am heaven.\nThe casketed treasure-sword roars from time to time,\nYet without meeting one of like kind, I vow not to transmit it.\n\nThe Feathered Immortal claps hands, the gourd dances,\nCrossing ridges, piercing clouds, the staff flies.\nComing and going eight thousand leagues takes but half a day,\nBy the southern slopes of Jinzhou, pine gates stand.\n\nCultivating a form like mine, my body withers to a dry catalpa,\nWhile the disciple’s essence gleams.\nLife after life, ever thus—\nHow could it compare to nurturing one’s own spirit?\n\nNurture the numinous root with essence, the spirit with qi,\nBeyond this truth, there is no truth.\nThe immortals refuse to speak plainly,\nMisleading millions upon millions.\n\nI serve no kings, till no fields,\nAt high noon I still lie abed, lute in arms.\nRising, I casually mint gold,\nLest others ask for alms-money.\n\nFrom the ends of the earth, people seek me,\nYet walking to the earth’s end, I find no one.\nLoyalty, filial piety, righteousness, compassion—practice convenience,\nNo need to seek me; you will naturally attain perfection.\n\nThose who call recluses idle know nothing—\nIn stillness, they perfect their work.\nClosing the door on a bright day, reading ends,\nSweeping the floor, burning incense until dusk.\n\nCease essence, cease qi, nurture the spirit,\nRefine essence in the cinnabar field, the body with qi.\nWhoever masters this art\nBecomes an immortal, deathless.\n\nA bamboo hat for a sail, a fan for a boat,\nRoam the Five Lakes and Four Seas at will.\nIn an instant, traverse the great thousand worlds,\nThough stones rot and pines wither through countless autumns.\n\nSome become Daoists, some monks,\nBlending with the world, their light veiled, yet gifted.\nThe bitter sea transforms into a celestial path,\nDipamkara ever lights hundreds of thousands of lamps.\n\n**Crossing Dongting Lake at Jun Mountain**\nBy midnight, the moon returns over Jun Mountain,\nIn the western neighbor’s small garden, green lotuses bloom.\nHeavenly fragrance, wind, dew—azure blossoms crystalline,\nThe bud lingers in the blue firmament, the crane has not yet come.\n\n**Presented to Tianqing Abbey in Fengxiang Prefecture**\nEight hundred autumns since attaining the Dao,\nNever once has my flying sword taken a head.\nUntil the Jade Emperor’s celestial decree arrives,\nI peddle black gold to mingle with the world’s flow.\n\n**Drawing a Sword in the Snow at Xiangyang**\nJian Mountain, one night, the jade dragon grows cold,\nIn Phoenix Grove, a thousand trees age like pear blossoms.\nWithin Xiangyang’s walls, few know—\nBeyond Xiangyang’s walls, the rivers and mountains are fair.\n\n**Encountering Zhao Tong at Sea**\nIn the Southern Palace, water and fire—I must aid,\nAt the Northern Pass, husband and wife—I myself am matchmaker.\nWithin the grotto, the dragon-child is proud and spirited,\nBefore the mountain, the lad delights in lingering.\n\n**Five Poems Presented to a Swordsman**\nSir, sir, your visage fierce and grim,\nDrawing your sword midair, qi and clouds clash.\nThree sharp shouts, swiftly you depart,\nWith a *clang*, an empty space—where a head once fell.\n\nThe sword rises, stars scatter like ten thousand pearls,\nWind and thunder follow, rain roars in the valleys.\nWhere the head is carried, no man remains—\nWhy chant loftily as you cross the Five Lakes?\n\nBrows knit, spirit resolute, voice like thunder,\nHearing of injustice, you cast aside your cup.\nWielding your sword midair, a thousand leagues you go,\nDeparting at the first watch, returning by the second.\n\nBushy brows, stalwart frame, fierce spirit,\nTen thousand leagues you leap into the void.\nOn your back, in its sheath, a three-foot sword—\nFor heaven, you show yourself as one who rights wrongs.\n\nSir, sir, seek not without,\nThe Dao must be transmitted, the sword must be sheathed.\nToday we meet by rivers and seas—\nA cup of village wine, I urge you to cease.\n\n**Presented to Master Cao**\nThe crane does not fly west, the dragon does not move,\nDew dries, clouds part, the grotto’s flute is clear.\nA young immortal speaks of idle matters,\nFrom afar, beyond colored clouds, a sigh is heard.\n\n**To Chan Master Huijue of Zhidu Temple in Tanzhou, with Preface**\nI traveled from Shaobin, eastward down the Xiang River.\nNow I meet Master Jue—\nObserving his Chan study, keen and bright,\nHis nature’s source pure and unsullied.\nKnees drawn close, he sits in stillness, gathering light within.\nBeyond his sleeve, no extra robe;\nBeyond his bowl, no extra food.\nHe has reached the shore of life and death,\nShattered the shell of afflictions.\nNow the Buddha’s robe lies silent, untransmitted,\nChan’s principle hangs precariously, nearly lost.\nWho will uphold and revive it?\nPerhaps it rests with my teacher.\n\nThe enlightened aid others with their minds,\nSages and worthies transmit the Dharma without departing from truth.\nI ask the master to expound the meaning of the Western advent—\nNow, who is the seventh patriarch?\n\n**An Idle Inscription**\nWalking alone, sitting alone,\nCountless people in the world do not know me.\nOnly the old tree spirit south of the city\nClearly knows I am an immortal passing by.\n\nPines wither, stones age, waters coil,\nHere, vulgar guests are hard to teach.\nFrom the terrace’s vantage, gaze at the scenery beyond—\nHurried winds stir, obscuring yellow dust.\n\n**Sixty Quatrains in Seven-Character Regulated Verse**\nThe twin passes of the spine pierce the crown gate,\nThis is the direct path of cultivation, its root.\nFrom the Flowery Pond, divine water frequently swallowed,\nThe Purple Palace’s original lord aids the crossing.\n\nConstantly let qi surge through joints and passages,\nNaturally, essence fills, the Valley Spirit extends.\nIn years to come, when attending the Jade Pool assembly,\nYou must remember the one who first taught you.\n\n**The Art of Qi Regulation**\nChaotic and undifferentiated, years uncounted,\nOne inhalation barely records five thousand words.\nRefining the elixir, concocting medicine, Southern Mountain’s beauty,\nAbsorbing qi, swallowing auroras, the nine seas dry.\n\nHow many times have my brows and temples brimmed?\nHow often have the seas turned to mulberry fields?\nIf Your Majesty asks my age,\nFirst came my body, then came heaven.",

      "translated_text": "**To You, This Composition**\n\nOur ancestral Dao is fundamentally non-action,\nIn the white-snow gourd, Kan and Li unite.\nOften I drink three cups of carefree wine,\nLeisurely I play a game of uncontentious chess.\n\nExtracting lead, adding mercury to preserve the true form,\nReturning to the root, restoring the foundation of life.\nWhen you grasp these two merging into one,\nAt last, you ascend the celestial ladder.\n\n**Probing the Mysteries**\n\nAlone I traverse, surpassing all peers,\nSilent and dim, enduring since ancient times.\nFormless and shapeless, it subtly creates,\nWith gates and doors within Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt the boundary of form and formlessness, who can fathom?\nIn the midst of emptiness and non-emptiness, the root is self-attained.\nThis Dao is not obtained from without—\nA thousand words, ten thousand phrases are but idle discourse.\n\nA single grain of numinous true cinnabar,\nNot placed at the ends of heaven or earth.\nDelving into scriptures yields no depth,\nClimbing mountains or facing waters reveals nothing.\n\nIts radiance secretly dwells on the peak of the unseen,\nIts brilliance resides high in the chaos’ origin.\nIf the world could but know its abode,\nTranscending the mundane to become a sage would be effortless.\n\n**Fallen Among Red Dust for Forty Springs**\n\nForty years adrift in the red dust,\nNon-action, non-affair, trusting in natural truth.\nMy livelihood rests only in the cauldron of Heaven and Earth,\nMy sustenance depends solely on the wheel of sun and moon.\n\nWithin the qi of the Eight Trigrams lies the supreme treasure,\nWithin the light of the Five Agents hides the primordial spirit.\nThough mulberry fields transform, it remains unchanged,\nForever a transcendent among mortals.\n\n**Alone Amidst the Myriad Forms of Heaven and Earth**\n\nFrom the beginning, I meticulously cultivate primordial work.\nWielding the Northern Dipper with vast intent,\nInverting the Southern Stars with bold courage.\n\nGhosts wail and spirits howl as the golden crucible congeals,\nPhoenixes soar and dogs transform as the jade furnace empties.\nHow can the vulgar world seek it in the ordinary?\nWithout attaining the unseen, it cannot be fathomed.\n\n**Who Would Believe the Flowery Pond’s Path Runs Deepest?**\n\nNeither near nor far, its mystery is hard to find.\nNine years of refinement like red jade,\nOne day of perfection like purple gold.\n\nOnce attained, it forever resists cold and heat,\nConsumed, it shields against life and death.\nI urge you, cultivators beyond the gate,\nFocus your thoughts on this Dao of the heart.\n\n**From the Water Palace, Seek Lead to Merge with Fire-Lead**\n\nBlack to red, red to black—profoundly obscure.\nQi generates qi, transforming flesh and skin,\nEssence contains essence, unifying life and nature.\n\nWhen the medicine returns, you become a true Daoist,\nWhen the elixir reverts, you are a sage embryo immortal.\n\"Exiting spirit, entering samadhi\"—empty words,\nWasting effort for ten thousand years in vain.\n\n**Nine Crucibles Refine Nine-Turned Sand**\n\nPrecisely dividing the seasons without error.\nSpirit, essence, qi, and blood return to the three essentials,\nNorth and south, east and west unite as one family.\n\nHeaven and Earth transform, white snow flies,\nYin and Yang harmonize, golden blossoms bloom.\nUltimately, phoenix music descends from the void,\nRiding tigers and dragons amidst purple clouds.\n\n**Observe at Noon and Midnight, My Lord**\n\nA single pulse of the Celestial Ford lies at the spine’s end.\nWithin the Golden Gate hides the Mysterious Valley Child,\nIn the Jade Pool sits the Palace of Supreme Harmony.\n\nApply only the most wondrous three-cycle fire,\nTo refine the numinous nine-turned elixir.\nI directly point to the many seekers of the Dao—\nIn action or stillness, never stray from Tiger-Dragon Shoal.\n\n**Returning to the Root, Restoring the Origin, Dao-Qi Levels**\n\nVoid yet not form, it becomes increasingly distinct.\nIn water, white snow subtly congeals,\nIn fire, golden lotuses gradually bloom.\n\nWhen discussing sacred mercury, it has no form,\nWhen examining true lead, it too has no name.\nI now speak for those who cultivate like mothers—\nDo not ask about refining gold, but about the utmost essence.\n\n**Arrange the Crucible and Turtle to Refine the Mysterious Root**\n\nAdvance and retreat—know the gates of Mao and You.\nLightning encircles clouds, sun and moon fly,\nDriving dragons and tigers out of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOne pill bestows upon the lord of youth,\nNine turns can burn away the marks of white hair.\nThis Dao is subtle, few understand it—\nIn this vast world, with whom can I discuss it?\n\n**Brewing a Cup of Wine, Composing a Poem**\n\nDrunk at dusk, chanting at dawn, I lose track of years.\nThe Qian horse often roams the nine earths,\nThe Kun ox at times emerges from the three heavens.\n\nIn the White Tortoise Grotto, husband and wife meet,\nIn the Azure Phoenix Nest, mother and child unite.\nLifting the numinous child to gaze from the mountain,\nLayer upon layer, they are golden coins.\n\n**Recognizing East and West, Wood and Fire**\n\nNaturally, the furnace and crucible roar with tiger and dragon.\nSimply follow Heaven and Earth to discern the signs,\nThen you will know Yin and Yang’s faithful sounds.\n\nLeft hand grasps the Southern Stars, plucking crane feathers,\nRight hand holds the Northern Pole, splitting the tortoise’s heart.\nThe immortals personally left this decree—\nWhy trouble yourself with external seeking?\n\n**The Heavenly Mechanism Runs Deeper Still**\n\nVain are words of ten thousand kalpas and a thousand gold.",

      "translated_text": "The Golden Elixir is no small golden elixir,\nWithin the yin crucible and yang furnace it rests secure.\nAll say it’s easy to seek mercury at Mount Shu,\nYet who knows the difficulty of finding lead in the Western Sea?\nThe journey to the Cavern of the Mystic Pearl is not far,\nAt the Ford of Red Waters, the path is straight and true.\nOnce you grasp the true way of the numinous pole,\nWhy trouble yourself with moon rites or star-altar steps?\n\nThe mechanism of past and present is most clear,\nYet it is only that the strength of all beings is slight.\nAll seek being within being, substance within substance,\nWho can perceive formlessness within the formless?\nTrue lead and sacred mercury are but vain expenditures,\nThe Jade Chamber and Golden Pass remain unopened.\nOnce the cinnabar gourd of original nature is overturned,\nOne swallows pills, awaiting the extension of years.\n\nFleeting fame and fleeting profit—how can they endure?\nTurning one’s head toward the mountains, the flavor grows sweet.\nIn this world, none share a heart that truly accords,\nWho else can engage with the Dao in mutual inquiry?\nAn inch not yet attained, one glibly speaks of a foot,\nOne not yet understood, one forcibly expounds on three.\nScriptures, gourds, and staffs as before,\nAre carried back into old Jiangnan.\n\nOriginally there is no sitting, nor is there walking,\nTo walk or sit is but delusion.\nLaozi’s words remain unexhausted,\nYet even more obscure are the sayings of Gautama.\nThe numinous pole, jointed, ascends to Heaven,\nThe supreme medicine, rootless, is born of Earth.\nToday I withhold nothing from you,\nFor when the work is done, this alone is Penglai.\n\nTo grasp the fire-seed and plant the knife’s measure,\nWho in this world knows of fire-seed or knife’s measure?\nThe eldest son of the mountain rides a white horse,\nThe maiden by the water herds a black tortoise.\nFrom non-being emerges being—the image of the Returned Elixir,\nWithin yin, yang is born—the foundation of the Great Dao.\nThe inversion of the Five Agents depends on the craftsman’s hand,\nWithout meeting the craftsman’s hand, do not act.\n\nOf the three thousand and more methods of cultivation,\nThe first and closest path is the firing of the elixir.\nIt must be the true substance of the Kan male,\nTo take the Li female is naturally precious.\nRefine the mercury within the sand to become deathless,\nCongeal the silver within the water to attain longevity.\nWhen the nine cycles and nine returns are complete,\nSurely the decrepit will be restored to youthful spring.\n\nTo plant the root of deathless longevity,\nNurture again the yin po and yang hun.\nFirst instruct the Mystic Woman to return to the Li chamber,\nThen dispatch the Empty King to guard the Kan gate.\nWhen the tiger reaches the jia border, the wind howls,\nWhen the dragon dwells within geng, the waters are warm.\nThose lost on the path lightly divulge these secrets,\nThis principle must be entrusted to those who comprehend.\n\nWith eyes closed, visualize the spirit in the Jade Gate,\nAs the time arrives, the fire-timing is transmitted in turn.\nClouds soar over the sea as the dragon swallows mercury,\nWind strikes the cliff’s peak as the tiger subdues lead.\nOnce the treasure within the body is refined,\nThe mystery of the Dao is casually grasped.\nAfter ingesting the knife’s measure, the scripture of the elixir descends,\nLeaping beyond the dusty dragon to ascend the Nine Heavens.\n\nA thousand days of effort, never idle,\nThe River Chariot bears its load up Mount Kun.\nThe tiger claps white mercury within the furnace,\nThe dragon emits red lead toward the crucible’s query.\nThe immortal registry records the name as the elixir ripens,\nThe netherworld’s ledger removes the entry as life is restored.\nOn what clouds do the feet alight as they return?\nStraight into the Three Purities to thank the sacred countenance.\n\nTo match true yin with correct yang,\nThree years of work complete, frost congeals.\nThe divine tortoise enters and exits the geng-xin position,\nThe cinnabar phoenix soars in the jia-yi direction.\nThe nine tripods first radiate twin auspicious qi,\nWithin the three primals, the five hairs’ light is renewed.\nIf in the dust there are those of like mechanism,\nTogether we shall dwell in the misty heavens of the deathless land.\n\nThe path of cultivating life is difficult within,\nThe deluded merely pore over ten thousand scrolls.\nWater and fire balanced—this is the medicine,\nYin and yang askew—no elixir forms.\nAbide in the feminine without losing the masculine to dwell,\nIn darkness, without deficiency, the white naturally dries.\nRecognizing this true and wondrous secret,\nWhy fear wind and rain hastening decay?\n\nHaving swallowed but a single grain, one is at peace,\nThe twelve-storied tower and nine-bend stream are linked.\nThe geng tiger circulates, feeding on sharp snow,\nThe jia dragon writhes, spouting numinous springs.\nLü’s second corresponds to three thousand days,\nWithin the nine nines, ninety thousand years extend.\nOnly when there is affinity may it be transmitted,\nNever lightly divulged to others.\n\nWho knows of the divine water in the Jade Flower Pool,\nWithin which lies the foundation of life and destiny?\nIts operation depends on dragon and tiger,\nIts drawing and adding rely entirely on Kan and Li.\nMorning and evening, the yellow gold powder is exhausted,\nIn an instant, the jade-like marrow is refined.\nAfter a thousand days of abstinence and ingestion,\nOne casually ascends the cloud ladder.\n\nThe clouds of the Nine Heavens are still, the crane flies lightly,\nHolding the bamboo slip, it flits away from the Great Purity.\nThe red dust beyond the body changes at will,\nThe white stone within the furnace forms in an instant.\nThe nine-plumed phoenix dances in the void,\nFive-colored clouds arise beneath the feet.\nTurning the head, one returns to the heavens above,\nWishing to bring sweet rain to parched mortals.\n\nThe infant descends the jade steps in leisurely fashion,\nHolding the mystic pearl, it comes straight down.\nAt midnight, purple clouds drape its plain form,\nSeveral times, crimson qi veils the peach’s bloom.\nIn its faint smile, the mechanism turns,\nAs it lightly moves, doors and windows open.\nThis is the true child of my family,\nHow could the foolish and ignorant casually guess?\n\nAs soon as the heavenly tally descends from the Jade Capital,\nThree thousand days accumulate effort.\nPraying to Heaven and Earth, the golden crucible opens,\nGathering yin and yang, the jade pot is sealed.\nSuddenly, the mortal frame is capable of transformation,\nDeeply knowing the wondrous Dao is no empty scheme.\nWhen the time comes, ask the elders in the dust,\nDoes this mystery exist in the world?\n\nWho recognizes the accomplished ones in the world,\nThose who in their lives understand the method of silver in water?\nA single staff props up Heaven and Earth,\nA three-foot Kunwu sword slays gods and demons.\nDeeply drunk, they sleep in the moonlit grotto,\nLoftily chanting, they scorn the red dust.\nSince awakening within, for the rest of their lives,\nThey have won the eternal spring of Penglai.\n\nThe red furnace advances the ridicule to refine golden essence,\nA single numinous pearl pierces the chamber with light.\nShaking Heaven and Earth reveals the power of the Dao,\nEscaping life and death demonstrates the work’s progress.\nCarefree, they leave traces across the Four Seas,\nReturning to the Three Purities to establish their names.\nStraight up the five-cloud path, the journey is steady,\nPurple simurghs and vermilion phoenixes come to welcome them.\n\nIf people of this age wish to learn longevity,\nFirst, the pivot must move day and night.\nWithin the indistinct, focus the will and qi,\nWithin the void, solidify the original essence.\nDragon befriends tiger, three cycles complete,\nHare runs, crow flies, nine returns are achieved.",

      "translated_text": "Having refined a crucible of sacred elixir,\nThe path home through the five-colored clouds grows clear.\nNo gain nor loss, no words to speak—\nIn motion, they perform their work; in stillness, they rest.\nThey drive the crimson ox to plow the cosmos,\nScatter jade grains to sow the mountains and rivers.\nCultivating without fear of a thousand days’ labor,\nThey know that partaking grants ten thousand years of life.\nToday I show you, for you are trustworthy—\nI teach you to become an immortal in this world.\nNo need for pairs or trios,\nOnly at Kunlun’s first crag.\nWhen moisture comes, the passions naturally submit;\nWhen heat arrives, the nature fears it cannot be tamed.\nAt times they enter the Three Primordials’ gate,\nWhen idle, they return to the Nine Bends’ river.\nIn this world, some can endure the firing—\nTheir lifespan matches Heaven and Earth, peerless in all.\nFrom beginning to end, all lies within the Jade Capital,\nThough once they walked the earth as ordinary men.\nFirst, they swallowed essence and consumed qi from the realm of being,\nThen, awakening to principle, they returned to truth and entered non-being.\nWater and fire naturally achieve the *ji ji*,\nYin and yang harmonize and correspond of themselves.\nFrom the furnace, the elixir of extended years is refined,\nWhile the seas and tides may shift from flourishing to withering.\nFree from fame and profit, they roam at ease,\nMeeting wine and song, they join in the revelry.\nFor years, they have not passed through the sacred gates,\nA thousand years they dwell only in the immortal realm.\nThrice they advance with water and fire,\nTruly, husband and wife are gathered in one place.\nOnce the elixir is complete and the work accomplished, the body takes flight,\nLeaving the dusty chamber to rise above the mortal stream.\nVast and boundless, ask not where it ends—\nCarving insects and seal script are but the blossoms of the Dao.\nOnly by guarding the center and forsaking learning does one grasp the profound;\nEmbracing the One in silence, one first perceives the sublime.\nThere is a thing like the yellow chrysanthemum’s pistil,\nYet no color like the green peach blossom.\nDo not wear out the mind’s earth with vain effort,\nFor smelting iron and refining gold only leads further astray.\nWhen the returning elixir’s work is complete but they have not yet ascended to Heaven,\nThey first guide others among men to find their own verdant path.\nA staff at both ends bears the sun and moon,\nA single gourd conceals the mountains and rivers.\nPoems flow freely in moments of leisure,\nWine is drunk in abundance, leaving coins behind in drunkenness.\nIf you ask what wondrous method I cultivate,\nIt is none other than the mercury and lead within the body.\nHalf red, half black—the mystery of the Dao,\nWater nurtures true gold, fire nurtures lead.\nThey reconnect the three inches of qi from past years,\nAnd circulate it through one cycle of Heaven.\nThe refining depends entirely on the power of yin and yang,\nAdvancing and retreating must rely on the authority of sun and moon.\nOnce this work is complete beyond the Three Isles,\nThey steadily ride simurghs and phoenixes to meet the immortals.\nReturning to the origin and restoring the primordial has reached Qian,\nAble to ascend and descend, they are called the Flying Immortals.\nThe arising of the first yang is the day to begin the work,\nNine revolutions complete the year of attaining the Dao.\nTo refine the elixir, seek the water within gold,\nTo establish the furnace, first set up Heaven within Earth.\nHere lies the principle of the returning elixir—\nWithout encountering an extraordinary person, vow not to transmit it.\nThe nine-and-five flying dragon has ascended to Heaven,\nIn due course, the power of the Red Emperor will follow.\nDelighted to meet the mercury pearl congealing at high noon,\nFortunate to encounter the lead mother forming the profound mystery.\nThe wild ape submits of itself—what need for refinement?\nThe untamed horse is tamed without the whip.\nOnce the single pill of Heaven’s elixir is refined,\nThe mind’s earth becomes forever firm and unyielding.\nWho in this world understands my family?\nMy family dwells in a glory apart.\nTheir overflowing chests store the Registers of Ascension,\nTheir rooms are filled with cinnabar refined by fire.\nThey drink the immortal wine of Heaven in great draughts,\nAnd constantly cultivate the undying flowers of the grotto.\nIf the mortal stream asks of my livelihood,\nEverywhere, multicolored clouds scatter in profusion.\nSaliva quenches thirst, qi serves as sustenance,\nTheir home lies in the Three Purities’ realm of the Jade Emperor.\nWhen refined in the golden crucible, the outer turns white,\nWhen cooked in the Jade Void, the inner becomes thoroughly yellow.\nOnly then do they know the Azure Emperor dwells in the Li Palace,\nOnly then do they trust that the golden essence is stored in the Water Mansion.\nThe common crowd seeks the wondrous principle,\nYet the *Cantong Qi* holds but a few lines.\nA purple edict descends with the simurgh from the Jade Capital,\nThe Primordial Lord summons them to the Three Purities.\nThey then partake of the cinnabar from the golden crucible,\nBrushing their cloud-embroidered robes as they ride the crane’s carriage.\nTwo celestial youths bear the jade pendants to guide them,\nFair maidens of the moon hold the sashes to welcome them.\nOnly after their work is complete and they have met the Perfected,\nDo they truly believe the immortal capital holds their names.\nCultivating, cultivating, until they reach Qian,\nThey are then called the Drunken Immortals among men.\nIn the world, time hurries the brief scenes of life,\nYet in the grotto, flowers and trees enjoy endless years.\nTheir form soars on sheer cliffs, no ordinary bones,\nTheir spirit dwells in the Mysterious Palace, a Heaven apart.\nI only wish the master would glance this way again,\nTo inquire beyond the profound into the even more profound.\nSitting alone with an empty mind, they turn the Yellow Court,\nNot following the times into profit and fame.\nTo preserve age, they hold only the true unified qi,\nTo cultivate life, they leave behind the hundred spirits.\nMorning by morning, they refine the fluid and return it to the Jade Mansion,\nNight by night, they face the origin to nurture the Jade Flower.\nDo not sigh that the old man finds joy in poverty,\nFor with ten years of work complete, they ascend to the Three Purities.\n\n**Parting from the Guest**\nMen receive qi and are endowed with yin and yang,\nTheir bodies equal Heaven and Earth, their lifespans long.\nThose who honor their origins can live forever,\nThose who slight their primal ancestors fall into oblivion.\nThe Three Palaces have their own method of reversing the flow,\nAll things possess their own means of operation.\nThe jade of Kunlun’s mountain, close at hand,\nHow many know it is the king of medicines?\n\n**Parting from the Guest**\nFew tread the path to the azure clouds,\nSpeak not of rise and fall—such matters never succeed.\nWhy is there no name on the golden tablet?\nIn the Jade Capital, there must be an immortal’s name.\nClouds return to the vast sea, dragons a thousand feet long,\nThe moon fills the long sky, a crane’s cry rings out.\nDeep gratitude to the enlightened sage-emperor of the Song,\nWho understood the vermilion edict and summoned the master.\n\n**Presented to Chen Chushang**\nThe net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide,\nYet one body comes alone to the Hua Mountains’ region.\nAfter the cold clouds depart, the waning moon remains,\nWhen spring snow arrives, it inquires of the Great Void.\nThe Six Grottoes’ Perfected return to the Purple Mansion,\nA thousand years of simurghs and cranes grow old in Cangwu.\nSince the master’s passing,\nIn all directions, few remain who are true men.\n\n**Lament for Master Chen**\nWho among the Daoists of Luofu shares his stream?\nClad in grass, eating bark, they scorn kings and lords.\nIn the world, the sexagenary cycle matters not to them,\nWithin their gourd, Heaven and Earth are free.\nCounting the moves of a half-finished game as the river moon dawns,\nA long whistle echoes through the autumn mountains and seas.\nAfter

dragon gathers mist;\nAt *Mao* and *You*, the tiger devours and radiates light.\nEntering the chamber, seize the mechanism—\nA single cinnabar pellet transmutes the body into pure yang.\n\nBlood drips from the hairline, eyes like rings;\nBreath exhaled forms clouds, enraged at the world.\nHow to endure the myriad injustices?\nA single formula must sweep away the fierce and stubborn.\nWhere the flood dragon is slain, the deep sea churns;\nWhen the raging tiger is vanquished, distant mountains are uprooted.\nFor burying worldly passions and bearing righteousness,\nThe sword’s gleam is stained with bloody marks.\n\nSnow falls thickly as dusk descends;\nGolden goblets urge the strumming of the scorched paulownia.\nPoems recited at the feast, moments unmeasured;\nThe sword dances before the

resides,\nHis countenance like peach blossoms, his form like silver.\nThough his hair and beard remain unblemished, he possesses the art;\nHis rosy complexion never ages, for he communes with the divine.\nTo Penglai he must go—now is the time to depart;\nThe yellow robe on the rack transforms into clouds.\nThough mulberry fields may turn to vast seas,\nA single pill of common medicine secures

sleep through idle days and months;\nWhite duckweed stills the wind as he fishes rivers and lakes.\nEver aligning his bearing with the Dao of Heaven,\nHe does not waste words on worldly fools.\nThe mountain paths are distant, untrodden by men—\nHas anyone lately heard news of Lord Mao?\n\nCranes serve as chariots, wine as provisions,\nFor he yearns for the land of immortality, where none die.\nIf earth’s veins can be shortened,\nWhy not extend human years?\nStars and constellations often appear within the gourd;\nSun and moon are ever concealed in his sleeves.\nShould you wish for the common folk to meet him,\nHe never strays from the path of mercury.\n\nMagic mushrooms have no seed nor root,\nYet those who drink and consume them revive their souls.\nAs long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,\nLet the crow and hare race through Heaven and Earth.\nThe Infant clings only to the mother within yang;\nThe Crone must face the honored one atop her head.\nOnce attained, it remains for a thousand ages—\nNo tombs or graves are left for descendants.\n\nWho in this world comprehends these words?\nCease clinging to fame and profit in your heart.\nCasually downing cups of wine to the full,\nWhen inspired, chanting a hundred verses.\nBeyond the world, rosy clouds serve as companions;\nWithin the gourd, sun and moon are ever fair.\nWhen the time comes and merit is complete, where will he return?\nStraightaway driving a cloud chariot into the grotto-heavens.\n\nDisciples of the Mysterious Gate sit at the center;\nObtaining the tally, the wise and good move the

woman ascends to wed the *Mu* youth.\nTruly, husband and wife together uphold their resolve,\nEstablishing teachings that entangle yin and yang.\n\nPointing afar to the high peak, he laughs aloud—\nRed rosy clouds and purple mists arise before him.\nOften in the dusty market, none recognize him;\nEver in the mountains, cranes welcome him.\nAt times, he plays with the jade toad to drive away ghosts and demons;\nAt night, he boils the golden tripod to cook jasper blossoms.\nWhen the time comes to journey to Penglai’s grotto,\nKnow that my immortal family bears a name.\n\n**Mocking the Worldly**\n\nHow laughable are those who ask of my home—\nA staff bearing clouds and things, trailing mist and rosy clouds.\nHis brows conceal lightning—no idle boast;\nHis hands plant golden

nights, none share his moonlit repast.\n\nBy the winding river’s bend, he sits and lies in contemplation;\nA single long path leads to the heavens’ edge.\nAuspicious clouds gather to attend the

divine.\nLonging to join the immortal singers and gain a lightened body,\nI soar past Penglai to the highest heavens.\nCrimson-crested cranes descend from beyond the clouds to greet me;\nPurple-scaled fish rise from the sea to welcome me.\nChang’e’s moon osmanthus blooms in full;\nThe Queen Mother’s immortal peaches gradually ripen.\nGazing down, the sun’s chariot nears dawn—\nSurely the mortal world has long attained longevity.\n\nThe four seas bustle, yet how few are at leisure?\nMen’s mouths speak only of worldly dust.\nKnowing you possess the Dao and have come to this mountain,\nWhy ask how one remains nameless in the world?\nTwelve towers of jade conceal secret formulas;\nWithin five thousand words lies the hidden pass.\nOnly then does one know the tripod holds the elixir of immortals—\nI beg but a single *daogui* to behold.\n\nSever the bonds of splendor, cast aside glory,\nFor from the first attainment, this is eternal life.\nOnce I shed my skin like a cicada by the brocade river;\nAgain, I changed my name upon Penglai.\nThrice dwelling, yet free from fortune or misfortune;\nA single speck of dust, yet bound to worldly sentiments.\nUnknowing of where merit’s fulfillment leads,\nI shall ride this dragon straight to the Jade Capital.\n\nIn those days, my worth filled the imperial capital;\nWith a carefree wave of my arm, I returned west—a true man.\nAlone, I possess ten thousand acres of white clouds;\nWho lacks even a single branch of cinnabar osmanthus?\nAt leisure, I seek the fisherman’s guidance by the Wei’s bends;\nDrunk, I ascend Lotus Peak, supported by a Daoist.\nOne day, I shall meet you again—\nBy bamboo streams and thatched huts, we’ll call to each other at night.\n\nThe golden hammer gleams as it dances upon the celestial steps;\nAlone, I ride the dragon, departing and returning.\nBeyond the heights, white clouds observe the sun’s cavern;\nAt ease, I slumber beneath the autumn moon, my arms outstretched to the sky.\nThe *li* flower, petal by petal, is born of heaven and earth;\nThe *kan* medicine, leaf by leaf, is nurtured by creation.\nDrunk at dusk by the Nine Forks, I turn to gaze—\nBeneath the Northern Star Mountain, bones gleam white.\n\nI forge bonds ever deep with the Dao’s essence,\nDaily following its ebb and flow.\nShould you wish to commune with the crane beyond the clouds,\nYou must diligently refine the gold within the water.\nWhen the elixir is complete, I fear heaven and earth too narrow;\nOnce ingested, what worry of illness or harm?\nThough I have not yet departed for the Jasper Terrace, I still mingle in the world—\nNo harm in a cup of wine to delight in idle song.\n\nGathering my zither and sword, I descend through misty vines—\nWhat fortune to pass this way today!\nMy appearance, though plain, remains tolerable;\nAcupuncture, alas, has little effect.\nI have read three thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures;\nI have mastered the twelve ancient arts.\nIf you doubt these minor Daoist arts,\nTry releasing your grip upon the golden steps.\n\nTipping back the cup of Huayang, I drink thrice more;\nRiding my dragon at dusk, I descend the southern crag.\nMy brows bristle as I strike my sword, leaving trails of starlight;\nMy robes, draped over clouds, gather emerald mist.\nThe golden liquid transforms into rain and dew;\nReturning to the Jade Capital, I age like pines and cedars.\nOnce, I used an iron mirror to illuminate spirits and ghosts—\nCrackling thunder searched the fiery depths of the pool.\n\nThe iron mirror smelts gold as flames fill the sky;\nIn the jade-green pool, the dragon rests beneath the setting sun.\nThe qilin’s intent harmonizes with heaven and earth;\nThe dew’s mechanism binds sun and moon.\nA three-foot sword lies across the banks of twin streams;\nA five-spiked crown adorns the lord of a hundred spirits.\nAt leisure, I don robes of feathers within an immortal’s grotto;\nAlone, I don golden lotus shoes to craft creation’s work.\n\nFollowing the karmic tide, I drift and sink at will,\nMy heart like water, like clouds—a single expanse.\nTwo scrolls of Daoist scripture, a three-foot sword,\nA flowering staff, a seven-stringed zither.\nThe elixir within my gourd, I bestow upon others;\nNew verses in my breast, I recite to guests.\nA single taste eternally adds a thousand years of life;\nA single grain of cinnabar transmutes a pound of gold.\n\nZither, sword, wine, and chess—dragon, crane, and tiger—\nCarefree and untethered, water without sorrow.\nAt leisure, I ride a white deer to wander the Three Isles;\nIn boredom, I drive a green ox to view the Ten Continents.\nFrom afar, I watch the bright moon rise over the emerald cave;\nHigh upon the green mountain, I hide amidst flowing clouds.\nShould men of this age desire the same,\nLet them abandon fame and profit, fleeting splendor.\n\nWithin the Purple Ultimate Palace, I know my own path—\nI personally whet my divine sword to pierce the returning *fei*.\nFirst, I dispatch the Jade Lad to open the southern hall;\nNext, I send the Azure Dragon into the Purple Tenuity.\nNine tripods of yellow sprouts nestle auspicious phoenixes;\nA single immortal’s frame nurtures sacred lingzhi.\nPenglai is no place for ordinary men—\nI fear only fools will leak the world’s secrets.\n\nTurning back, I finally emerge from the dust;\nCreation’s work lies solely in man.\nHad I earlier cast off the celestial dragon’s earthly net,\nHow would I know the White Tiger’s emergence from true nature?\nEndless is the path—who detains me?\nSilent and wordless, I naturally unite with the divine.\nStriking my sword in the deep of night, where do I return?\nClad in stars and moonlight, I cleave the qilin.\n\nSpring wanes, idly passing fallen blossoms;\nEach time I dance with my sword, I sigh.\nEver anxious that the white sun’s light and time are fleeting,\nEver resentful that the blue sky’s road is distant.\nMy original intent seeks neither fame nor profit;\nMy fundamental heart admires only water and mist.\nOf the world’s myriad floating and sinking affairs,\nWho among the enlightened can compare to my family?\n\nThe sun for harmony, the moon for cinnabar—\nThe lords of Hua and Xia behold with mortal eyes.\nBenevolence and righteousness differ as Hu and Yue;\nWorldly sentiments are as difficult as Tai and Heng.\nAfter refining the Eight Immortals, the bell’s spirit is wondrous;\nForged across the four seas, it chills the gall to fear.\nLaughing, I point out ten thousand injustices—\nRiding my dragon, wielding my sword, I guard the ninefold gates.\n\nSince parting, six eastern winds have blown over Luoyang;\nDrunken eyes, drowsy emotions—indolent and unyielding.\nShaking heaven and earth, my golden sword roars;\nSmelting sun and moon, the jade furnace glows red.\nMy staff sways over the three thousand kings of Chu’s domains;\nMy crane soars through the ten thousand layers of Qin’s mists.\nTo report to the immortal of Jin City:\nWe shall meet again in spring at Kuaiji Peak.\n\nBefore refining the returning elixir, first refine the heart;\nOnly when the elixir is complete does one perceive the Dao’s

gourd, sun and moon rest within your breast.\n\nThe work of immortals—how few can comprehend it—\nCultivating nature, prolonging life, one hums to oneself.\nAn iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden coins;\nA stone is carved, and youths string them into strands.\n\nA single grain of millet holds a hidden world;\nIn a two-sheng cauldron, mountains and rivers boil.\nThe white-haired elder’s brows trail to the ground;\nThe blue-eyed foreign boy points his hand to the sky.\nIf you grasp this mystery within the mystery,\nBeyond this mystery, no mystery remains.\n\nThe Winnowing Basket star and the Proud Host descend from the endless sky—\nHow could the mortal realm not stand in awe?\nThe dragon emerges from the water, its scales and armor complete;\nThe crane soars into the heavens, its feathers whole.\n\nAmid the dust, you teach a thousand eyes to see;\nYet in the world, few know the *Erya*’s refined verses.\nIt is but the ledger of fortune for the common folk—\nHow could such subtle wonders lightly be passed on?\n\nAt leisure, I swing my arms and enter the Gate of Heaven,\nBrushing my sleeves, I slowly gather the colored clouds.\nSilent, I look down upon the Yellow Valley’s child;\nWith a smile, I bow to the Purple Radiance Lord.\n\nI intend to ascend the Jade Palace and pay homage to the Metal Mother,\nThen visit Yingzhou to behold the solar wheel.\nJust then, Chang’e prepares a feast—\nThe jade nectar, newly brewed, steams with fragrance.\n\nOnce I followed Liu and Ruan, drunk in Peach Blossom Spring;\nUnconcerned with debts for wine in the mortal world.\nA hempen robe serves as collateral for now—\nWhen the sun returns from the nine heavens, it shall be repaid.\n\nPhoenix-down robes are not to be prized;\nEven fox-fur garments cannot compare.\nThis is the world’s priceless treasure—\nNo need to test it in the fire’s trial.\n\nRecalling past affairs, I sigh with pity:\nI once read the thirteenth scroll of the immortals’ scriptures.\nWhen Empress Wu died, she was but a maiden;\nWhen Chen Yu perished, he remained a youth.\nTwo wheels of sun and moon bear their burdens;\nNine mountains and rivers rest upon a single shoulder.\n\nBy day, no one speaks of such tidings—\nA gourd of spring wine leaves me drunk and content.\nWith sleeves hanging loose, I stride proudly above the world’s dust,\nMy gourd holding the fruits of many journeys.\nFame and profit, beyond the body, are not the Dao—\nBefore the Gate of Dragon and Tiger, discern the truth.\n\nAwakening from a dream, my soul visits the Court of Heat;\nFor years, my traces have hidden in the dust of the world.\nIn Huayin’s market, we meet again—\nNot the usual wandering peddler of medicines.\n\nTen thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, a three-foot zither—\nLiu An recognized me as a kindred spirit.\nAt my staff’s tip, a gourd of wine;\nIn my furnace, cinnabar transforms into countless grains of gold.\n\nBored, I sleep drunk at the crossroads;\nAt leisure, I fish in the heart of Dongting.\nWho among those we meet could recognize us?\nI fear that if we soar into the heavens, none could find us.\n\nOnce I battled Chiyou before the Jade Throne,\nSix dragons high in their chariot, phoenix bells ringing.\nBehind the Tathāgata’s carriage, I followed the golden drums;\nBeside the Yellow Emperor’s banner, I wore an iron crown.\n\nDrunk, I darkened the black beard of the Three Isles;\nEnraged, I drew my frost-edged sword, chilling the Ten Continents.\nAfter the age of the Xuanyuan’s dominion,\nI hid deep in the ravines, long sought but never found.\n\nMy horns and scales resound like a bell in the azure waves;\nMy face is like ice, my bones like pine.\nThe treasured sword in its scabbard often roars;\nThe golden hammer in my sleeve stirs the wind.\n\nWhen drinking, I am the life of the gathering;\nWhen reciting poems, I join in perfect harmony.\nNext year, I shall surely attend the Penglai assembly,\nRiding a fierce and multicolored dragon.\n\nImmortals enter the golden gates at dusk;\nThe gates of generals and ministers stand in the Jade Capital.\nYet if the grotto holds no fine sights,\nIt is for pity of the world’s living multitudes.\n\nMy heart’s zither harmonizes with the wandering crane;\nMy sword in its scabbard awaits the slaying of whales.\nBetween advance and retreat, neither path seems right—\nI rely on you to point the way forward.\n\nThe Nine Tripods boil a single grain of cinnabar,\nThe fire’s timing naturally unfurls the child’s flower.\nStars illuminate the blue lotus seeds;\nSun and moon conceal the white horse’s teeth.\n\nSeven returns refine the emerald dew;\nNine reversions bring forth the crimson mist.\nIf one seizes and consumes the

Gold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can keep them.\n\n**Three-Character Poem**\n\nThis Dao is no ordinary Dao.\nThe root of life, the aperture of life and death.\nSpoken, it seems foul; practiced, it is wondrous.\nAll despise it, all bark at it.\nThe great key lies in inversion.\nDo not shun filth, do not calculate.\nOnce grasped, its effects appear at once.\nHeaven and Earth unite—*(the crow bears the omen)*.\nMouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.\nSwallow it into the belly, and you’ll know for yourself.\nThe sprouts of medicine are fresh, the sign of the primordial.\nExamine between the brows, follow the reverse path.\nThe essence of moisture nurtures, naturally continuing the line.\nWhen these two remain, only then is it sublime.\nTo practice it makes others cry out.\nQi must be firm, spirit must not dissipate.\nIf you do not practice, you’ll age in vain.\nRecognize the truth, and the old return to youth.\nThose who do not understand, do not speak of it.\nThis small method accords with the Great Dao.\nEssence, qi, and spirit are the elixir of immortality *(read as \"essential\")*.\nPreserved in stillness, repaid in clarity.\nRide the phoenix and simurgh, listen to Heaven’s music.\n\n**One Hundred-Character Chant on the Inner Elixir**\n\nNurture qi, forget words, and guard;\nSubdue the heart to act without acting.\nIn movement and stillness, know the ancestor—\nWith nothing to do, whom else would you seek?\nThe true constant must respond to things,\nYet in responding, avoid delusion.\nNot deluded, the nature abides;\nNature abiding, qi naturally returns.\nQi returning, the elixir forms itself;\nWithin the crucible, Kan and Li unite.\nYin and yang generate reversal,\nUniversal transformation—a single thunderclap.\nWhite clouds ascend to the

creation.\nThese twenty lines in all\nAre indeed the ladder to heaven.\n\n**One Hundred-Character Chant on the Outer Elixir**\n\nLead and mercury dwell in the crucible,\nRefined into a priceless pearl.\nAll comes down to two words,\nResolving the writings of ten thousand households.\nUse lead yet do not use lead—\nWithout lead, mercury will not return.\nMaster the theft of black within

power then manifests in the world.\nThose who use lead are countless,\nBut how many value true lead?\n\n**Admonition to the World**\n\nA speck of goodness aids others.\nA speck of evil—refrain from committing it.\nClothing and food follow fate—\nBe content, and joy comes naturally.\nWhat does it matter what life is?\nWhy consult divination?\nDeceiving others brings misfortune;\nForgiving others brings blessing.\nThe eyes of heaven see clearly—\nRetribution comes swiftly.\nHeed my words,\nAnd gods and ghosts will submit.\n\n**Lyrics in Mixed Meter**\n\nFallen and destitute, fallen and destitute,\nSleeping in villages by night, wandering cities by day.\nAt leisure, I roam green mountains;\nWhen weary, I sell elixirs in the marketplace.\nThe money earned is not hoarded—\nI buy fine wine and pour it myself.\nDrunk, my chanting stirs gods and ghosts,\nCarefree as the sun sinks in the west.\n\n**Six-Character Poem**\n\nSpring warms, half the flowers bloom,\nI wander leisurely upon the rocks.\nAlone I carry the jade rhythm and elixir script,\nStrolling idly over green moss and emerald moss.\nSlept nine years in an ancient grotto,\nDrank flowing radiance by the thousand cups.\nWhen meeting others, speak not of other matters—\nPoint to the white clouds coming and going.\n\n**Four-Character Self-Narration**\n\nA Tang dynasty *jinshi*,\nToday an immortal.\nFeet treading

suddenly I heard a neighbor speak of elixir arts.\nI asked if he would transmit them—\nA single word of assent, and no difficulty remained.\nSeveral strange texts came into my hands,\nOne night I lit a lamp and read without cease.\nBy dawn, the sun was high, and I had finished—\nUnaware, I was drunk as if in a trance.\nIn that trance, I saw something appear,\nShaped like the sun, bright as a sudden sail.\nIt said it was the essence of cinnabar,\nFit to refine mortal substance in the crucible.\nMortal substance cannot transform into truth—\nTo transform truth, one must obtain the true within.\nNo need for bismuth, no need for mercury—\nThe returning elixir must be planted in the furnace.\nThe mystery within mystery is called true bismuth,\nYet when using bismuth, one does not use it.\nSometimes called dragon, sometimes tiger,\nSometimes infant boy, sometimes wondrous girl.\nA single name for cinnabar encompasses a thousand forms,\nYet within the one, there is one that is the

pearl to play.\n\nThe dragon swallows the mysterious treasure and suddenly soars,\nBut the soaring dragon is caught by me to ride.\nWith a single breath, I ascend to return to the Azure Vault,\nWhere the Azure Vault stretches boundless, without east or west.\nNo dawn, no night, no years, no months,\nNo cold, no heat, no four seasons.\nOnly when cultivating to the realm of non-action\nDo I begin to sense the wondrous and the strange.\n\n*Knocking the Hexagrams Song*\nA drifting wanderer between Han’s end and Tang’s realm,\nThus the knocking of hexagrams remains unfathomable.\nUnrestrained in all directions, without barrier,\nStillness is non-action, movement is form.\n\nI drink wine, I eat meat,\nYet hold fast to rouge and powder, cutting off lust.\nI practice meditation, chanting verses of rouge and powder,\nUpholding precepts while wine and meat fill my belly.\nForm is medicine, wine is emolument—\nWithin wine and form, there is no constraint.\nOnly through flowers and wine was long life awakened,\nDrinking wine with flowers, even spirits and ghosts weep.\n\nDo not break precepts, do not transgress lust—\nBreaking precepts, true suchness sinks;\nTransgressing lust, the treasure of long life is lost.\nOnly those with Dao-power may attain it,\nAnd those with Dao-power are true free spirits.\nWine is a good friend, flowers a companion.\nIn the streets of flowers and willows, seek the true person—\nThe true person is found only in the flower-street meal.\nPluck flowers, wear them, drink the wine of long life,\nRevering non-action, the Dao naturally flourishes.\nLet the deluded masses bark and jeer—\nThe immortal flowers and immortal wine are the immortal land.\nArriving at this land, one is no ordinary guest,\nWhere wondrous girls and infant boys birth joy.\nWithin the cave, flowers of all seasons are ever plucked,\nEach flower knits the elixir of long life.\nThe elixir of long life is plucked from the flower’s heart,\nLayer upon layer of flower-medicine in radiant spring.\nYet people of this age do not grasp the principle within flowers—\nA single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\n\nGrateful to heaven and earth, moved by the empty void,\nI met an immortal master, my ancestral lineage.\nWhispering in my ear, the profound and wondrous intent,\nHe lifted me to Penglai’s first peak.\nThe first peak is an immortal thing,\nWhere only golden flowers bloom in trance.\nMouth to mouth, the transmission leaves no written trace,\nYet the numinous root is strengthened to the marrow and bone.\nStrengthening marrow and bone, refining the numinous root,\nPetal by petal, peach blossoms bring spring to the cave.\nIn seven sevens, white tigers are reared in pairs,\nIn eight eights, green dragons total one catty.\n\nTrue father and mother escort the original palace,\nWood-mother and metal-father, their natures inherently gentle.\nWithin the twelve palaces, the toad’s spirit appears,\nAs earthly souls descend and heavenly souls alight.\nLead first formed, mercury first born,\nJade crucible and golden tripod yet unheated.\nOne husband, one wife, mirroring heaven and earth,\nOne boy, one girl, uniting Qian and Kun.\nGeng must be born, Jia must be born—\nWhen Jia and Geng are born, the Dao begins to sprout.\nPlucking the root of heaven and the marrow of earth,\nWhite snow and yellow sprouts grow of themselves.\n\nLead also begets mercury, mercury also begets—\nMercury and lead are refined together in one place.\nThis refining is not of essence and fluid,\nBut the essence of heaven and earth, Qian and Kun, sun and moon.\nThe Yellow Dame matches them to perfect union,\nTransmitting the secret without error, mouth to mouth.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Two Origins rely entirely on mercury,\nThe Five Phases and Four Images how could they leave lead?\n\nLead begets mercury, mercury begets lead—\nSeizing the power of Qian and Kun’s creation.\nIn the profound and obscure, trance is born,\nFrom trance and obscurity, a mass is formed.\nNature must be empty, intent must be focused,\nLest the monkey-mind climb recklessly.\nWhen the flower-dew first opens, touch is strictly forbidden,\nSealed within the earthen crucible, do not add or remove.\nWithin the jade crucible, the civil fire refines,\nThrough the twelve hours, guard the One.\nAt this time, the Yellow Path unites yin and yang,\nThe three natures and original palace suffer no leakage.\n\nWhen qi moves, the true fire tempers—\nDo not let the dark pearl leave the precious hall.\nIncreasing the fire’s measure, guard against danger,\nFor the first nine, the hidden dragon must not be refined.\nThe subtle workings of fire and the knife’s edge transform,\nThe yellow sprouts of the great earth grow everywhere.\nWithin the Five Phases’ number, one yang is born,\nThe twenty-four qi arrayed like a banquet of pearls.\nWhen the fire is sufficient and the medicine complete,\nThe dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound.\nOf three leads, only one lead is achieved,\nThe golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to appear.\n\nReinstall the furnace, reestablish the tripod,\nRiding the tiger, mounting the dragon, departing the mortal realm.\nWhen the sun’s essence first appears and the moon’s radiance congeals,\nThe two eights unite in Ren and Bing.\nDragon-mercury binds, tiger-lead forms—\nPenglai is but a short journey away.\nKun-lead and Qian-mercury are the ancestors of the golden elixir,\nDragon-lead and tiger-mercury are most spiritually attuned.\nOnly when this principle is grasped is completion achieved,\nAs thirty thousand divine dragons guard the crystal.\nGuard the time, fix the day, clarify the talisman’s moment,\nDevote the heart solely to reverent intent.\n\nWhen black lead is refined and true essence purified,\nA single clash settles great peace.\nThe three chariots transport the pearl treasures,\nReturning to the precious treasury, naturally attaining numinosity.\nHeavenly spirits protect, earthly deities welcome,\nMerging Qian and Kun, the essence of sun and moon.\nWith a single roar, the tiger emerges from its den,\nPhoenixes dance and simurghs fly from the golden city.\nCinnabar paired with mercury in balance,\nA band of rosy clouds arrays before the Great Clarity.\nFrom the lead pool, golden light bursts forth,\nMercury-fire flows like pearls into the imperial capital.\n\nBeyond the union of dragon and tiger, hold fullness,\nAs the sagely walks and the numinous flies within the precious vase.\nWithin a single hour, the golden elixir is achieved,\nAscending to the golden gates as purple clouds arise.\nThe immortal peach ripens—pluck and consume it,\nAs the myriad transformations pay homage, heaven and earth rejoice.\nWith fasting and vigil, await the birth of one yang,\nThen advance the Zhou Heaven, fathoming the *Can Tong Qi*.\nFathoming the *Can Tong Qi*, refine the golden elixir,\nAs water and fire steam through the barrier gates.\nNurturing the embryo for two months, the divine elixir forms—\nHow could a man’s pregnancy be ordinary?\nThe inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir achieved,\nInner and outer join in harmonious union.\nForming a single pellet of purple-golden pill,\nTransforming and soaring through heaven and earth for eternity.\n\nThe elixir enters the belly, no common thing—\nYin is stripped away, transforming into pure yang.\nAscending and transcending as a guest of the Three Clarities,\nName fulfilled, merit accomplished, reaching the highest heavens.\nThe guest of the Three Clarities mounts a cloud-borne chariot,\nRiding the phoenix, soaring through the empyrean into the Great Void.\nSuch carefree joy and delight—\nRoaming the Three Realms, most pure and wondrous.\nAbove the Great Void, the cultivator of truth,\nBright and round, without a single thing.\nWithout a single thing, only the Dao is manifest,\nAs the true countenance of the perfected emerges from the five directions.\nImmortal boys and girls welcome with colored clouds,\nWithin the Palace of Five Lights, the true decree is transmitted.",

carefully,\nAnd you must delve into the ancient gold and jade.\n\nGold and jade intermingle without reckoning years,\nWondrous within wondrous, mysterious within mysterious.\nEncouraging Niu Sheng and Xiahou Ge, the two scholars:\nTwo scholars—yet not scholars,\nNot scholars, but immortals in the making.\n\nWithin the land of China, they met in person,\nGazing heavenward, their eyes alight with laughter.\nOnce more, turning back.\n\nCrane-like in form, tortoise-like in bones,\nDragon’s chant, tiger’s visage.\nI have utmost words to exhort you,\nWould that you, sir, neither doubt nor guess.\n\nSimply bask in the sun, breathe the wind,\nSwallow rain, exhale thunder,\nFire lodged in the hidden palace, water aiding the cinnabar terrace.\nMetal and wood exchange, earth returns to its place,\nLead and mercury part, revealing the embryo.\n\nRed blood transforms, white milk flows,\nLight penetrates the apertures, stirring the hundred bones.\nNow coiled, now unfurled,\nAt the sound of laughter—ha ha!—the child gasps yet does not die.\n\nThe belly empty, fasting evermore,\nRepaying fame and profit with wild song and drunken dance,\nRepaying wealth and honor with hempen sandals and plain straw shoes,\nAsking the year’s cycle—why keep count?\n\nSee the mulberry fields turn to yellow dust,\nGreen mountains and white clouds make a fine abode.\nI urge you: go home, go home.\n\nTo Hermit Liu of White Dragon Cave:\nJade flees, gold flies—both luminaries rush,\nFirst blooms the flower, then comes autumn frost.\nVainly boast of a thousand years of wealth and longevity,\nYet it is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.\n\nHow swift that lightning flash!\nA hundred years amount to but thirty thousand days.\nWithin them, cold and heat alternately torment,\nUnaware, the youthful face fades in darkness.\n\nThough children and grandchildren fill your sight,\nAffection and love only entangle further.\nWhen essence is exhausted and the body withers,\nWho can teach them to briefly preserve their countenance?\n\nWith no means to extend life,\nOne must surrender the body to flowing waters.\nLook upon the sages of old—\nHow many knew how to remain in the world?\n\nYet there is a way to remain in the world,\nOnly because men of this age mismeasure.\nThey scramble to the mountains in search of herbs,\nRefining lead, controlling mercury, concocting cinnabar.\n\nConcocting cinnabar is no trifling matter—\nOne must seek crimson blood within the Kan trigram,\nTake it to the Li position to temper yin essence,\nHarmonizing and blending at the proper time.\n\nThe proper time

irrigation, embracing true essence.\nAfter ten months, the embryo is shed, swallowed into the mouth,\nSuddenly, the mortal body is imbued with spirit.\n\nThis matter is rare in the world,\nNot known to ordinary men.\nIf in past lives you lacked immortal bones,\nHow could you easily encounter it?\n\nThe Golden Elixir should be refined at once,\nFor time flies swift as an arrow.\nTo catch fish, one must weave a net—\nWhy not still the heart and refine lead?\n\nLest the candle be snuffed out by the wind,\nThe six paths of rebirth make heaven hard to reach.\nLately, men of the world are full of deceit,\nAll donning plain robes to call themselves Daoists.\n\nAsk them what metal and wood are—\nThey fall silent, mute as the afflicted.\nYet they claim to practice qi absorption and fasting,\nClaiming other paths and distant roads.\n\nHave they not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by Lord Yin,\nWhere the Taiyi’s ear-containment method is strongest?\nDo not fault my words for being too wild or coarse,\nOnly because men of this age are hard to discern.\n\nOnly when your heart aligns with mine\nDare I pour out my heart to you.\n\nInscribed on the Gate of Master Huang’s Hermitage on Tongwu Mountain:\nI possess words most mysterious within the mysterious,\nWandering the eight directions, nowhere to speak—\nLike drifting clouds, they float to Ningsun,\nWhere I meet you, sir, in the profound.\n\nI know you are a solitary cloud’s traveler,\nAbout to speak of the subtle and formless,\nThe root source of the great Dao.\n\nI urge you to seek the truth within—\nThere is one, divided into three and five,\nOriginally nameless—cold spring’s trickling,\nQi flowing ceaselessly,\nRising through Kunlun, returning to purple float.\n\nSinking and rising, entering the central palace,\nThe four images and five phases all manifest,\nGreen Dragon seizes the White Tiger,\nAuspicious winds rise, sweet dew descends,\nLead congeals true mercury, cinnabar forms,\nA single wheel of fire reigns supreme.\n\nHaving cultivated the true, be steadfast,\nAble to turn heaven and earth, float mountains and seas.\nMoving through heaven and earth, none can know,\nTransforming

with sorrowful heart,\nConsider, sir, the vigor of life.\n\nLest the great limit arrive at your body,\nAnd you drift once more into birth and extinction.\n\nI leave these words to express my
