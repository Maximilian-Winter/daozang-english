  "full_translation": "**Collected Essentials of the Internal Elixirs of the Perfected**\n\n**Title:** *Collected Essentials of the Internal Elixirs of the Perfected*\nCompiled by Master Xuanquan. Three scrolls.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**Collected Essentials of the Internal Elixirs of the Perfected, Scroll One**\nCompiled by Master Xuanquan, the Daoist of Autumn Moon over Sea and Sky\n\n### *Laozi’s Record at Hangu Pass* #1\nBeneath the Azure Prime, sun and moon arise,\nFrom two flanks they ascend, merging as one.\nForth from the Jade Pool into the Golden Chamber they flow,\nRound as a pellet, hue like the tangerine,\nWithin lies a savor sweet as honey.\nThe śramaṇa attains it through dhyāna,\nThe yellow-robed through transcendence.\nShould you obtain it, guard it well—\nLose it once, and your body shall perish.\nAscend the hidden pass, thrice winding,\nEnter the Gate of Life, form unwearied,\nDeep and fathomless, hard to entreat.\n\nSun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nAll the ten thousand images, bright and clear.\nBefore the Three-Five, after the Three-Five,\nFive-Six makes thirty, returning to life.\nLife and decay cycle through twelve,\nTwelve divides into twenty-four.\nThe twenty-four qi shift in turn,\nAll hexagrams and lines reside herein.\n\nQuicksilver, one flavor, splits in two,\nPaired with the yin bowels, consummation nears.\nOnce consummated, they become husband and wife,\nThen one perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.\nRed lead and black tin form the Great Elixir’s head,\nFrom red to black is true cultivation.\nFrom black extract the essence, from red the marrow,\nResolving red and black, the medicine is peerless.\nTake red into black to preserve longevity,\nUse black into red, and you become a Heavenly Immortal.\nInverting the two completes the return,\nThe Fire Dragon transforms into a Heavenly Immortal.\n\nStudents of the Dao, reflect on yourselves—\nDo not transmit this to the greedy or lustful.\nAt Hangu Pass, at Liangshan’s mouth,\nI now carve this stone to leave these words.\n\n---\n\n### *Song of the Returned Elixir by Immortal Zhongli of Zhengyang*\nOne mother bears two children,\nOne boy and one girl.\nThe boy is the root of yin, the girl the lord of yang.\nWhen yin comes, yang abides,\nNever losing their primal ancestry.\nThe spleen grinds, food digests itself,\nReturning to the fertile earth.\nStudents are as numerous as hemp,\nBut the enlightened span past and present.\nSeeing the dragon yet not knowing the dragon,\nEncountering the tiger yet not knowing the tiger.\nThe dragon is not in the eastern dusk,\nThe tiger not in the western barbarians.\nIf you seek from the one source,\nBrightly you will know what is hidden or revealed.\nIf you search east and west,\nEven with eyes, you are as blind.\n\nYang resides in yin’s womb,\nYin in yang’s belly.\nThe boy is white, the girl red,\nNaturally they become husband and wife.\nPlant hemp, harvest hemp;\nPlant millet, harvest millet.\nIf you do not recognize lead,\nYour white-haired years will be full of toil.\n\nVague and indistinct,\nThe two things are hard to covet.\nDim and obscure,\nThe three clans seem like kin and performers.\nPassion unites the myriad medicines,\nQi harmonizes without words.\nSmelt lead and mercury until dry,\nLike a cat crouching over a mouse.\n\n---\n\n### *Song of Stone Bridge by Immortal Zhang Ziyang*\nMy home lies north of Stone Bridge,\nWhere mountains lock and waters bar, ancient trees stand dense.\nBeneath the bridge, the ravine’s waters flow to Kunlun,\nThose who drink the spring find its fragrance rich.\nMy dwelling within the mountains is truly boastworthy,\nThe narrow land all planted with unfading flowers.\nNorth of the mountain, a cave hides a fierce tiger,\nEmerging from its den, it roars, birthing clouds and mist.\nSouth of the mountain, the pool’s depths conceal a flood dragon,\nSoaring through clouds, it descends rain, the sky grows dim.\nThe two beasts sometimes battle,\nThe Mysterious Pearl flies and hides, revealing auspicious signs.\n\nThe scene is fair, I rejoice in secret,\nPouring my own wine, I grow mellow with drink.\nDrunk, I pluck a stringless zither,\nIts notes teach me to listen closely.\nOh, the drunkenness—let none know!\nDazed and silent, I seem a fool.\nGazing up, I marvel at the workings of creation,\nThe sun sets in the west, the moon rises in the east.\n\nHeaven is earth, earth is heaven,\nInverting yin and yang accords with nature.\nRecognize where the Five Phases invert,\nAnd you shall ascend the rosy clouds to return to the Grotto-Heaven.\nA house of gold, beams of white jade,\nGolden Lads and Jade Maidens attend before you.\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are arrayed in clarity,\nThe ten thousand images of the cosmos appear boundless.\n\nNo day or night, only ceaseless continuity,\nGathering and dispersing, the celestial fire-timing is complete.\nShould you wish to know the true locus of the Golden Elixir,\nSeek a master to reveal the lead within water.\n\nWater begets fire, fire begets water,\nWater and fire must distinguish front and rear ranks.\nTo discern ascent and descent, know host and guest,\nLead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.\n\nThere is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,\nKnowing contentment, ever content, return to your root.\nAll ministers celebrate the Heavenly Peace,\nWhen weary, the nation prospers, the people rejoice.\n\nThis song is fine for contemplation,\nThose of the same Dao will grasp its meaning.\nLater generations of cultivators,\nAre but storing thoughts and circulating qi.\nAt hand, it is most easy,\nWithin daily use, it is your own.\nEven if predecessors had fifty years,\nI ask you: what did they study before?\n\nThis one gate holds savor,\nThose who ingest it find its wonders unmatched.\nFirst it dispels illness, then extends years,\nUsing fire to refine, transforming the yang body.\nStudents of the Dao, reflect on yourselves—\nDo not be constrained by heterodox minor methods.\nKnowing only to awe others in the moment,\nUnaware of your own hidden withering.\n\nI exhort later learners, be resolute in will,\nDo not idly abandon home to wander distant lands.\nThe wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body,\nHow could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?\n\nDo not procrastinate, indulging in greed and baseness,\nHasten to seek a master and grasp the Mysterious Pointer.\nIf in this life you do not learn to cultivate life,\nWho knows what womb you may inhabit in the next?\n\nSince you have the heart, see it through to the end,\nThe great matter of human life is only life and death.\nIf august Heaven betrays the Daoist’s heart,\nIt will plunge me into the Three Wretched Realms as a lowly ghost.\n\n---\n\n### *Golden Stone Paper Pavilion by Ma Ziran*\nAt the eastern edge of the great sea, the red solar wheel,\nHow many times have green mountains been ground to dust?\nA hundred years hold thirty-six thousand days,\nEach day, how many die and are born?\n\nThe Nine-Turned Numinous Elixir is not of the Five Metals,\nWithout divine transmission, it is hard to seek.\nShould you wish to know the true immortal formula of mother and child,\nFirst refine the medicine by learning to refine the heart.\n\nWhy strive to burn elixirs to preserve youth?\nBustle is not the marketplace, stillness is not the mountains.\n\nAt this time, men seek the elixir of long life,\nYet facing circumstances with a heart devoid is the great return.\nSwiftly nurture the cinnabar field, swiftly nurture the spirit,\nUse hidden virtue to aid the living.\n\nIf this body is not delivered in this life,\nIn what life shall this body be delivered?\nTo attain long life, tame the heart,\nDo not dwell on past affairs or future days.\nSimply in stillness, let spirit and qi unite,\nWhat worry then of not reaching the groves of the great immortals?\n\n*Mysterious Female Song by Pure Yang Lü True Man*\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Golden Mother,\nBefore Heaven and Earth, it conceals the true earth.\nEmbracing the origin, holding the One, it relies on generation,\nA single qi, continuous through past and present.\n\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water is the root of Heaven and Earth,\nRefine it, consume it, and life endures.\nSince ancient times, immortals have had no other method,\nAll rely on the Mysterious Female to establish their root.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known,\nFools imagine the kidneys and fixate the heart, idly laboring.\nImmortals shatter all side doors,\nYet the deluded still cling to their errors.\n\nMay I ask, what is the Mysterious Female?\nAt a baby’s birth, first appear the two kidneys.\nBetween the two kidneys, a single point of light,\nIn reverse, it becomes the mother of the elixir; in sequence, it forms a person.\nAt the sprouting of the first yang, act swiftly,\nExtract the white from the black, the existent from the nonexistent.\nWithin an hour, the elixir is complete,\nNine years and three years of mere waiting are in vain.\n\nIf people truly knew the Mysterious Female,\nIt is neither in the heart nor the kidneys.\nTrace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth,\nNo wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.\n\n*Great Elixir Song by Pure Yang True Man*\nThe Three Clarities’ palaces lie hidden atop Kunlun’s peaks,\nSun and moon float in radiance, surpassing purple mist.\nPools and ponds brim with jade-like liquid,\nPavilions and terraces circulate divine springs in layers.\n\nThe Azure Dragon rides fire, lead becomes water,\nThe White Tiger surges waves, mercury turns to lead.\nTo seek the Kan male’s mate,\nRely on the Li female to forge the bond.\n\nThe Yellow Dame exhausts a thousand schemes,\nThe golden crucible blooms with a single lotus.\nThe chaste woman holds the crow on the left,\nThe general wears the hare to guard the west.\n\nThe Black Tortoise crouches beneath the red furnace,\nThe Vermilion Bird perches before the Flowery Pavilion.\nThen, calming the spirit to glimpse the reflection,\nAfter three cycles, the work is done, and one rides the cloud-cake.\n\n*Song of Nature and Life*\nTo refine the golden elixir without comprehending nature,\nThis is the foremost malady in cultivation.\nTo refine only the true nature without refining the elixir,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.\n\nGrasping life’s foundation yet losing ancestral nature,\nIs like a mirror without its precious reflection.\nA man whose life spans Heaven and Earth,\nWields yin and yang as his fundamental handle.\n\nWhen nature and life are complete, it is profound and mysterious,\nThe great waves at the sea’s bottom ferry the Dharma boat.\nOnly when the dragon’s head is captured alive,\nDoes one know the master craftsman’s skill is no empty boast.\n\n*Rhapsody on the Golden Elixir by Immortal Lord Li*\nThe Dao originally has no form, the elixir arises naturally.\nOnce it soars and reveals its treasure,\nOne consumes it to ascend as an immortal.\n\nSeize the two things within the furnace, called Dragon and Tiger;\nEnclose the five phases within the cave, distinct as mountains and rivers.\nOf old, men wandered the land of mystery,\nEmbracing the art of the True One.\n\nDesiring longevity like Heaven and Earth,\nDesiring a body as firm as metal and stone,\nThey gathered the essence of mercury,\nRefined the substance of lead.\n\nForged with great fire,\nAdvancing fills, retreating empties;\nStored in the central palace,\nHarvested in due time, used on appointed days.\n\nThus, the marrow of the west’s geng and xin,\nThe essence of the east’s jia and yi,\nEmit purity, nurture excellence, bloom like flowers, flourish like herbs.\nObserve its body—united yet distinct,\nProbe its wonder—congealed and complete.\n\nThe Li female and Kan male,\nPaired, they ultimately defy death;\nThe sun crow and moon hare,\nComing and going, they naturally attain long life.\n\nThe eight trigrams array around,\nThe nine palaces stand in formation.\nThree hundred sixty days,\nWith shifting seasons and nodes;\nTwenty-eight constellations,\nWithout repeated paths or fixed degrees.\n\nMercury subdues lead, lead subdues mercury,\nThe source of creation is hard to fathom;\nYang arises from yin, yin arises from yang,\nWho can discern the numbers of their shifts?\n\nVast and obscure, within lies the Great Clarity.\nFrom formlessness, form is born,\nFrom namelessness, a name is forced.\nThose who know its mechanism can steal the workings of creation;\nThose who misunderstand its principle merely waste true primordial essence.\n\nRefined through the nine returns,\nOne transcends the mortal to enter sagehood;\nSwallowing a single grain,\nOne reverses aging to become an infant.\n\nAlas! Ancient gallops and modern races,\nMorning dashes and evening toils.\nHousehold after household casts aside white snow,\nEach and every one discards the yellow sprout.\nThe pure light departs and cannot be detained,\nThe rosy complexion fades and is hard to restore.\n\nReflecting on the awakening from the southern bough’s dream,\nWealth and honor are unreliable;\nContemplating the northern mound’s lofty tomb,\nMerit and fame crumble in vain.\n\nSome refine cinnabar into purple powder,\nSmelt black tin to obtain dark frost.\nSome dine on mist and feed on auroras,\nOr abstain from grain to cease eating.\nAll claim supreme medicine,\nYet none follow the ancient methods.\n\nHow is this different from seeking fish in green trees?\nThe higher the tree, the more the fish elude;\nOr drilling ice for fire?\nThe deeper the ice, the more fire vanishes.\n\nLittle do they know:\nThe body is the palace of qi,\nQi is the abode of spirit.\nContinuing true qi with true qi, the spirit does not scatter;\nSupplementing true essence with true essence, the form has a master.\n\nNaturally, white bones grow flesh, and withered skeletons revive,\nOne can chase after Red Pine and follow Peng Zu.\n\n*Azure Dragon Song by Heavenly Master Tian*\nHeavenly Master Tian was originally a carefree wanderer,\nIn youth, he studied Confucian books and revered official virtues.\nHad it not been for past-life ties to immortality,\nHow could he have received the true master’s wondrous formula?\n\nThe wondrous formula, few words spoken,\nBefore parting, he entrusted me with the pot’s song.\nThe song does not speak in common language,\nIt teaches the gathering of immortals’ deathless art.\n\nOne medicine, rootless and beginningless,\nThe primordial qi of before Heaven.\nExpounding profound principles, there are alchemical texts,\n*The Awakening to Reality* and *The Kinship of the Three*.\n*The Kinship of the Three* speaks of immortal methods,\nThe Later Han’s true man, Wei Boyang.\nUsing the *Book of Changes* to elucidate the great medicine,\nLeft as the king of elixirs for ten thousand ages.\n\nThe essence of sun and moon, the marrow of Heaven and Earth,\nEncompass the profound principles of the golden elixir.\n\nWords subtle, prose plain, the Dao profound and deep—\nWithout true transmission, how could one fathom its mystery?\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* speaks with utter clarity:\nThe celestial immortal’s formula for life eternal.\nThe Patriarch of Purple Yang, pitying those to come,\nRevealed the celestial mechanism once more.\n\nMan grows old, the crow caws in vain,\nIts cry passing north of Black Crow Mountain, then farther west.\nIn *Spring in the Qin Garden*, the heartbreaking verse:\n\"Begin swift cultivation—yet even now, it may be too late.\"\n\nTo cultivate, to seek the great Dao,\nNever mistake the Three Peaks for karmic retribution.\nThree thousand six hundred are but side doors;\nApart from the golden elixir, all are false constructs.\n\nProclaim the great Dao, spread the mystic wind,\nRevive the lineage of the southwest for an age.\nShould one ask the immortal elder’s true lineage,\nHe was originally known as Purple Yang of Mount Zhu.\n\nLong ago, the immortal elder suffered exile,\nBy chance in Yaolin he transmitted the secret to Shi Tu.\nLater in Piling, he passed it to Niwan,\nAnd Jade Toad’s ancestral name was thus established.\n\nAlas for the dusty world, a flower in the mirror,\nA human life—how many years can it last?\nTo restore the original true countenance,\nSeek the root sprout where the Five Agents have no place.\n\nSeek the root sprout—do so early,\nLest your own lead and mercury dwindle.\nYear after year passes, growing ever fewer,\nWaters flow, flowers fall, and man ages in vain.\n\nMan grows old—if he would cultivate,\nWhat need for precepts or scripture-reading?\nOnly cast aside discrimination, uproot love and hate,\nAnd with an impartial mind, the Dao will naturally flourish.\n\nTo cultivate, endure humiliation willingly,\nLet spittle dry on your face without retaliation.\nIf I wrong another, calamity will extend;\nIf another wrongs me, it turns to blessing.\n\nIn seeking the great Dao, embody unyielding metal,\nLet hardship and worry never stir the heart.\nWealth and poverty, high and low—Heaven has ordained them;\nLose or gain, sink or float—let it be.\n\nTo cultivate, there are tasks to perform:\nTo learn the Dao, first learn to sit in meditation.\nYet if one sits in dry emptiness, it is still in vain—\nDrawing cakes to allay hunger only leaves one starving.\n\nTo learn the great Dao, prepare the elixir chamber,\nThe room must be secluded, the land must be auspicious.\nIf the land is not auspicious, the spirit will not abide;\nEven with the true seed, it will suffer harm.\n\nTo refine the elixir, one must find companions,\nThree like-minded souls to guard one another.\nWithout such comrades of the same resolve,\nThe great medicine will not form, and mercury will flee.\n\nTo learn the great Dao, seek a kindred spirit,\nThe elixir’s head must be the gold within water.\nWithout accumulated merit and hidden virtue,\nOne may wander the world’s edges yet find it nowhere.\n\nTo cultivate, await the proper time,\nHaving met the master’s transmission, do not act rashly.\nKeep it deeply hidden, never boast to others,\nLest you invite demonic hindrance and disrupt the great work.\n\nTo learn the great Dao, tend to the household,\nRely on gentleness and harmony to nurture the utmost truth.\nWhen the virtue of earth is thick, the elixir’s virtue is thick—\nSpeak only of concern for the Dao, not for poverty.\n\nIf one worries over poverty, the Dao is hard to discern;\nWhen the elixir way is complete, all such concerns vanish.\nRoam the four seas at will,\nFor the traveling kitchen will provide sustenance.\n\nTo cultivate the true, dwell amidst the mundane,\nNot by abandoning home or forsaking wife and daughter.\nClothing and food through the seasons must be supplied,\nAnd one must not shun the cold of dawn or the heat of dusk.\n\nAfter the elixir is complete, one may leave the household,\nDwelling in grotto palaces and famous mountains through the years.\nSleeping under dew, dining on wind, roaming sea isles,\nWith cloud shoes and moon staff, traverse the ends of the earth.\n\nTo cultivate, avoid incurring debt,\nFor who does not love wine, sex, wealth, and temper?\nOrdinary folk cling to these and harm their spirit;\nIf I love them, there is no obstacle.\n\nI love wine—yet I have immortal friends,\nNo need for measures or yeast jars.\nA fine brew from Snow Mountain,\nPoured into the gourd, it flows to the lips again and again.\n\nI love sex—yet mine differs from others’,\nNot seeking rest in the bridal chamber’s depths.\nWithin the brothel’s smoke and flowers, immortals hide;\nOn Vulture Peak’s assembly, seek Mahākāśyapa.\n\nI love wealth—yet mine comes from the Dao,\nNot to buy beauties or handsome talents.\nRather, buy a youth and a crone,\nTo sit in purity all day, refining the platform elixir.\n\nI love temper—yet mine holds power,\nNot like Xiang Yu contending for hegemony.\nSlay the flood dragon in the Eastern Ocean’s depths,\nExecute the tiger cub on Western Flower Mountain’s heights.\n\nThe dragon can chant, the tiger can roar,\nTo seize the tiger and capture the dragon, there is a knack.\nShould you doubt, ask Guanyin—\nThe dragon maiden’s pearl offering reveals the Dao’s wonder.\n\nThe tortoise can fly, the serpent can dance,\nHidden in the north, known as True Warrior.\nYin and yang blend as the essence of water and fire,\nImmortal sages descend to become the Dao’s ancestors.\n\nThe root of nature, the stem of life,\nThough named differently, they emerge from one source.\nUnite them in one place to form the elixir,\nReturning to the primordial qi of before Heaven.\n\nThe stem of life, the root of nature,\nThe primordial, majestic, supreme honor.\nTake them to refine the medicine of longevity,\nA single grain preserves your nature and life.\n\nThe essence of the sun, the radiance of the moon,\nHidden in the southwest, in the households of Li and Kan.\nSeize them, lock them in the cauldron of Qian and Kun,\nWhere kingfisher clouds rise to veil purple mist.\n\nThe radiance of the moon, the essence of the sun,\nJade hare and golden crow—two luminaries shine.\nWestward they go, eastward they come, without fixed direction,\nYet where the two crescents meet, the great elixir is born.\n\nYang spirit-soul, yin spirit-corpses,\nSoul and corpse conceal each other in mutual abode.\nTo seek soul and corpse, go to Qian and Kun,\nThen reverse the sun and moon in Kan and Li.\n\nYin spirit-corpses, yang spirit-soul,\nThe wise first enter through the gate of Wu and Ji.\nWithin the gate of Wu and Ji lies true earth;\nRely on the mysterious female to establish the root.\n\nWater turns to lead—just one flavor,\nNeither spirit nor qi.\nIt is the root of nature and life,\nHidden within the precelestial heart and Kan.\n\nDo you not see the path to Heaven?\nTo refine the elixir without hindrance, yin must assist.\nObserve the Jin dynasty’s battle against Jingyang’s magistrate—\nWho raised his dwelling and ascended in flight—was this not so?\n\nDo you not see the road to Penglai?\nAfter three thousand deeds are fulfilled, one rides the clouds away.\nIn days of old, Lü Dongbin of the Tang,\nEven now still seeks others to deliver.\n\nThe White Tiger Song of Heavenly Advent:\n\nTo scoop the moon from the heart of the Northern Sea’s waves,\nFirst bind the clouds on the Southern Mountain’s ridge.\nIf one understands this intent,\nOne may ride the flying crow to meet the Primordial Sovereign.\n\nHalf the moon shines on the Western River,\nA single crow flies over the Northern Sea’s head.\nMoon sets, crow sinks—nowhere to be found,\nIn the Palace of Broad Cold, one rides the ox backward.\n\nThe Gate of the Mysterious Female stands open all day,\nWithin lies a single aperture merging with the numinous terrace.\nNo bolt, no lock, no guardian attends—\nSun and moon, east and west, come and go as they will.\n\nThe lead cauldron gleams, its light casting shadows upon the curtain,\nSnow-white flakes of river and mountain descend in delicate strands.\nReturning late from the Jade Pool’s feast,\nOne steals a sweet peach of immortality.\n\nTo gather the herb, one must recognize the moon in the heavens;\nTo refine the elixir, one must know the gold within the water.\nIf the moon lacks the *geng* qi or gold lacks water,\nEven with true lead, one’s efforts are in vain.\n\nPlant the seed in the Valley of No Death,\nUpon the rootless tree, flowers bloom of themselves.\nA single fruit of primordial chaos is formed—\nSwallowed into the cinnabar field, it blazes like fiery mist.\n\nSince ancient times, few live to seventy,\nWhen the hexagram’s qi nears its end, none can reclaim it.\nTo begin cultivation swiftly is already too late;\nWhen impermanence arrives, regret comes too late.\n\nWealth and poverty, fate’s presence or absence—\nIn cultivation and discerning the Dao, subtle reckonings unfold.\nIf one does not strive to become a divine immortal,\nOne squanders the life of a true man.\n\nThe sacred proclamation of the Dao’s Primordial Heavenly Ancestor:\nClearly, dragon and tiger are the perfected truth.\nWho could have foreseen that in a dream upon Green Mountain,\nWithin the six directions, eternal spring is concealed?\n\nVast and unfeeling are the six paths of existence,\nYet from a single qi, the myriad transformations arise.\nDifferent names emerge from the same source—this is the root of the Dao;\nThe same source with different names—this is the name of the elixir.\n\nAtop the White Jade City, jade nectar is refined;\nWithin the golden crucible, golden lotuses are sown.\nWhen the fire is sufficient, the elixir forms with ease;\nAfter ten months of frost, the medicine must be firm.\n\nWhere the tiger roars on the mountain, wind arises;\nWhen the dragon intones in the sea’s depths, waves surge.\nAfter the tiger’s roar and dragon’s cry cease their battle,\nWind calms, waves still, and the infant is born.\n\nThe Azure Dragon rides the fire, soaring with the Vermilion Bird;\nThe Dark Warrior, hungry, devours the White Tiger’s gold.\nInverting *kan* and *li* depends on *wu* and *ji*;\nDrawing and adding rely on *bing* and *ren*.\n\nHalf a catty of true mercury, half a catty of lead—\nPrecisely at mid-autumn, the moon reaches its first quarter.\nIf one encounters midnight, do not gather;\nAt the full moon’s height, words fail.\n\nTo see yet not perceive is not blindness;\nTo hear yet not listen is true deafness.\nIf one understands seeing others as seeing oneself,\nHearing as if not hearing—this is true wisdom.\n\nThe Jade Hare’s eastern descent brings heat;\nThe Golden Crow’s western rise brings cold.\nKnowing the marvel of inversion within the mysterious,\nDo not compare short and long before others.\n\nInversion begets reversal, reversal begets inversion—\nA nameless infant is born.\nTo know whose child this infant is,\nIt is the primordial essence before heaven and earth.\n\nThe wondrous vessel, once formed, is marvelously strange,\nEncompassing the myriad images, harmonizing with heaven’s mechanism.\nStars, constellations, sun, and moon turn with the mechanism—\nEven the inversion of heaven and earth goes unnoticed.\n\nSupreme virtue acts without striving, without contrivance;\nLesser virtue acts with effort, with purpose.\nIf one wishes the Dao to arise from supreme virtue,\nOne must first establish roots in lesser virtue.\n\nDo not boast of partial insights or broad investigations;\nWithout understanding the root, do not speak loftily.\nHeaven and earth are the true root and foundation—\nRecognize this, and the Dao is not difficult.\n\n**Liu Haichan’s True Man’s Song of Returning Elixir, Dispelling Delusion**\n\nI have heard that the world speaks of the golden elixir,\nMany study it, but few attain it.\nIt is not in water, nor in mountains—\nOriginally, it lies only within the human realm.\n\nThe returning elixir is near yet unrecognized;\nSeek it within the qi between midnight and noon.\nKnocking teeth, striking drums—thousands of methods,\nYet the more one seeks the golden elixir, the harder it becomes to find.\n\nClosing the eyes, concealing the gaze, stilling thoughts—\nWhen it emerges from the mouth, one cannot hear it.\nTaking this as the method to ascend to heaven,\nOne finds it unrelated to true pain or joy.\n\nA hundred days of qi circulation yield no result,\nLeading only to old age and death in vain.\nThe sage circulates qi with natural rhythm,\nFor life and destiny are not obtained through qi alone.\n\nHolding the breath until the belly swells and the face turns sallow,\nExhausting the mind and strength in qi circulation—\nWho has ascended to heaven through qi circulation?\nWho has prolonged life through it?\nA thousand practice it, a thousand die—\nRefining the golden liquid is not like this.\n\nThe great Dao of immortals relies solely on the elixir,\nWhich can sustain one for a thousand years.\nThe thirty-six qi method for pacifying the spirit,\nBetween midnight and noon, ceaselessly applied.\n\nYet I sigh for fools who love to delve into Chan,\nCompeting in clever words through each sitting.\nEven with all the oral instructions, death cannot be avoided—\nTrue Buddha Dharma is not like this.\nThis *is* the true Buddha Dharma, the true Dao—\nOne child, two brothers.\n\nEmbracing the two qi to form a single elixir,\nWhere else would one seek the spirit?\nThe immortals’ true lead, true mercury, true dragon and tiger—\nWithout recognizing the *daogui*, one seeks in vain.\n\nThe method of union—one phrase—\nReveals lead and mercury, recognizes the golden elixir.\nIf the golden elixir is to be attained, it is not difficult,\nBut the human heart’s cunning breeds obscurity.\nSeeing it before one’s eyes yet not recognizing it truly,\nRecognizing it yet blaming the body for practicing qi circulation.\n\nIf one mistakenly practices qi circulation, when will it be mastered?\nThe golden elixir can be accomplished in a hundred days.\nThe three fields forever yield the yellow sprout,\nAnd for ten thousand years, the body remains unharmed.\n\nBetween midnight, perform four tasks,\nYin and yang descend together, all interconnected.\nExternally draw yin, internally embrace yang—\nInversion and contemplation lie entirely within oneself.\n\nWith the left hand, grasp the Azure Dragon’s head;\nWith the right, seize the White Tiger’s tail.\nAt once, it enters the mouth, gradually sweetening—\nOnly then does one know this substance’s fragrance and beauty.\n\nThis is the gold within water,\nMastering the mysterious gate, possessing the principle.\nThe myriad truths’ essential collection of inner elixirs, first scroll—**concludes**.\n\n*(Note: The title is incorrect. It should be* Pure Yang True Man’s Golden Liquid Returning Elixir Song*.)*\n\n**The Myriad Truths’ Essential Collection of Inner Elixirs, Middle Scroll**\n*Compiled by Xuanquanzi, the Daoist of Autumn Moon over Sea and Sky*\n\n**Queen Mother’s Oral Instructions**\n\nEating and drinking unceasing—body never light;\nSound and sight unceasing—spirit never clear.\nThoughts and cares unceasing—heart never still.\nHeart not still, spirit not efficacious;\nSpirit not efficacious, the Dao unachieved.\n\nThe essential subtlety lies not in gazing at stars or worshipping the moon,\nNor in tormenting the body through toil.\nWhat is prized is profound stillness within the square inch,\nNo restless striving—\nOnly then may the Dao of immortality yield long life.\n\nIt is also said: banish defilement, halt thoughts,\nStill the heart, guard the One.\n\n**The Supreme Lord’s True Instructions on Inner Contemplation**\n\nNon-arising as essence—\nWhat arises is the human heart.\nThe heart has three aspects:\nPast, future, and present.\n\nThe past heart arising is called *thought*;\nThe future heart arising is called *anticipation*;\nThe present heart arising is called *pursuit of phenomena*.\nThese three hearts, ceaseless day and night,\nExhaust the spirit and deplete qi,\nLose one’s true numinosity,\nAnd obscure the original dharmakāya.\nThrough countless kalpas of rebirth,\nAll is these three hearts—\nFrom ancient times to now,\nWho has ever escaped?\n\nIf one seeks liberation,\nAwaken to the original face before father and mother were born.\nWhat is there?\nNeither heart nor thought,\nSelf and other both forgotten—\nNaturally in accord with the Dao.\nThus it is said: *non-arising as essence*.\n\nNon-extinction as function—\nExtinction means no desires arise,\nAll entanglements severed,\nHeart and thought both forgotten.\nNon-extinction is one’s true nature.\nTrue nature is the Dao’s function;\nThe Dao is nature’s essence.\nEssence and function distinct,\nResponding to things without delusion,\nEverywhere unobstructed,\nNature manifest, heart extinguished.\nThus it is said: *non-extinction as function*.\n\nEssence and function attained in truth and constancy—\nTo attain truth and constancy is to be unbroken each day.\nThe true person naturally dreams no dreams.\nNo dreams—ever abiding in the Dao,\nNaturally dreamless.\n\nThe prior thought is the guest;\nThe guest is the transient.\n\nThe heart is called the guest—when it arrives, simply receive it and let it pass. The later thought is the host; to be the host is to know thoughts and dispel thoughts. When thoughts arise, do not cling to them. Not clinging means returning home by the path, originally without root or trace.\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity* states:\n*Inwardly observe the heart—heart has no heart;\nOutwardly observe the form—form has no form;\nObserve things afar—things have no things.\nWhen these three are awakened, only emptiness is seen—\nNeither color nor image.*\n\nThe prior thought is thought—\nThe prior thought stirs waves without wind.\nThe later thought is illumination—\nIllumination is water; water returns to its source.\nRemove defilement, cease thought—\nCeasing thought is the function of non-extinction.\nIlluminate the heart, guard the One—\nTo guard the One is to keep virtue constant as at the beginning,\nTo grasp the meaning and forget the words.\n\nOnly extinguish the moving heart—\nEver knowing, ever aware.\nDo not extinguish the illuminating heart—\nNot extinguishing the illuminating heart,\nSamādhi and prajñā are perfectly clear.\nIf the illuminating heart is not extinguished—\nWhen the illuminating heart is not extinguished,\nOne dwells in desire yet without desire,\nAbides in dust yet transcends dust.\nThe body is like the great void—\nThe body like the great void is unseen when looked upon,\nUnheard when listened to.\nAnnotation: *Departing from all extremes.*\nSimply concentrate the empty heart—\nThe empty heart is unattached within and without.\nDo not fix the mind—\n*Inwardly observe the heart—heart has no heart.*\nWhen active, employ illumination—\n*Passing through a forest of a hundred flowers, not a single leaf clings to the body.*\nDo not rely on any dharma—\n*Before father and mother were born, neither heart nor dharma—what is there that is not so?*\nYet the heart abides constantly—\n*Inner thoughts do not go out; outer thoughts do not enter.*\n\nIf sunk in emptiness and quiescence without illumination—\n*Forgetting what can be forgotten, the heart that can be lost is no more.*\nMovement is being pulled by things.\nIf illuminated without quiescence—\n*Knowing movement, not abiding in stillness,\nRecognizing spirit as the master,\nTurning things without departing from the source.*\nQuiescence and illumination both complete—\n*Purity and stillness unite with the Dao.*\nPenetrating the source of the Dao—\n*Bright and clear, spirit settled and serene,\nSteaming and permeating the hundred meridians,\nReaching everywhere, filling the entire cosmos.*\n\nQuiescence and illumination both dissolved—\n*Neither ox nor man is seen, transcending all directions.*\nA pure breeze fills the pavilion—\n*Attaining non-action, returning to the root and restoring the origin.*\nThere is arising yet no arising—\n*All entanglements are severed.*\nThere is transformation yet no transformation—\n*Vast kalpas endure eternally.*\nThat which arises cannot arise—\n*The body is like withered wood, the heart like cold ashes.*\nThat which transforms cannot transform—\n*Nature abides, life halts.*\nThus one can be ever-arising and ever-transforming—\nEver-arising is the black of yang.\nEver-transforming is the essence of the five grains;\nYin obtains the true fire of the nine yangs and transforms itself.\n\nNo time is not arising,\nNo time is not transforming—\nNo time is not arising means the heart-fire descends moment by moment.\nNo time is not transforming means the kidney-water ascends instant by instant.\nHarmonious fire permeates, filling and circulating everywhere;\nObserving the inner realm, unbroken at all times.\nRefine essence into qi, refine qi into spirit, refine spirit to merge with the Dao.\n\nThe scripture states:\n*To know and cultivate refinement is to be a sage.*\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Mysterious Origin**\nBlack lead and red mercury—head of the great elixir,\nEntering black from red is true cultivation.\nExtract essence from black, blood from red;\nResolving red and black, the medicine is peerless.\nUsing red to enter black ensures longevity;\nUsing black to enter red, one becomes a celestial immortal.\nOne is lead, also called the sovereign.\nTwo is mercury, also called the minister.\nIf lead is not true, mercury will not draw near.\nIf mercury is near, it does not lose its place as minister.\nThe green-waisted messenger, the red-blooded general—\nHarmonizing the two natures, different clans in the same flock.\nWhite mercury becomes the brain, yellow sprouts the root.\nTransforming lead into powder, refining mercury into dust.\nYin resides in yang’s position, yang’s number evenly balanced with yin.\nThe moon waxes as the sun wanes, cold and heat distinctly divided.\nOpening and establishing the method’s image, resplendent with patterns.\nOnly this Dao of ours endures with heaven and earth.\n\n**Song of the Crucible**\nThree times five, one inch and a fraction.\nMouth four times eight, lips two inches.\nTwo feet in length, thickness even.\nBelly with three navels, sitting warmly.\nYin above, yang rushing below.\nHead and tail martial, center civil.\nBeginning at seventy, ending at thirty days.\nInternally one hundred, well-regulated.\nYin fire white, yellow sprouts silver.\nComing and going, wandering without leaving the door.\nGradually growing large, nature and temperament pure.\nThen returning to the One, restoring the origin.\nAfter one cycle, great toil.\nGuard it closely, do not grow confused or dull.\nThe path is distant, profoundly subtle.\nIf you attain this, you will comprehend heaven and earth.\nMidnight and noon, nourishing soul and spirit.\nAttaining longevity, entering the immortal village.\nThose who delight in the Dao, seek its patterns.\nContemplate deeply—no need for further discourse.\n\nThe Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire Phases of the Golden Elixir\n\nSun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nTheir hexagrams revolving, most clearly shown.\nThree and five before, three and five behind,\nFive and six make thirty, then life returns anew.\nBorn and extinguished, cycling through twelve,\nTwelve divided yield twenty-four.\nThe twenty-four qi mutually shift and change,\nAll hexagrams and lines refined within this frame.\n\nQuicksilver, one flavor split in two,\nTransforms yin and yang to form *jiwei*.\n*Jiwei* then paired as husband and wife,\nOne perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.\n\nThe Perfected One of Pure Yang said:\nGreat indeed are these twelve verses,\nHarmonizing with the five thousand words.\nAt the very beginning, original nature\nIs the supreme spirit of primordial origin and form,\nThe one numinous essence that governs life.\nThe root-source of life’s stem is prior to heaven,\nThe formless supreme essence,\nThe one qi that preserves nature.\n\nSpirit and essence are the foundation of nature and life.\nThis one numinous true nature\nIs obscured by the heart.\nThe pure unity of life\nIs enslaved by the body.\nIf one can preserve the body so that life’s foundation is ever firm,\nAnd still the heart so that nature’s root is empty and numinous,\nHow can life be secure without nature?\nHow can nature be enduring without life?\nNature and life are originally one,\nYet in movement they become two.\nToday’s scholars each cling to one side.\nTo perfect the great Dao of the True,\nThere is nothing but the unity of nature and life.\nTo achieve this unity,\nOne must simply purify the heart and quiet the mind.\nWhen heart and mind are pure and still,\nThe myriad dharmas naturally return to their root.\n\nWhy is it that through countless generations,\nPeople cannot preserve their nature and life\nAnd realize the great Dao?\nBecause the heart follows things and drifts,\nNature is turned by things,\nThe mind covets beauty while life is lost to desire.\nThose who depart from these two realms\nCling to minor practices, acting and moving,\nGrasping heterodox methods, deludedly cultivating and striving.\nThey invoke the names of golden elixir and medicinal substances,\nTerms like \"withdrawing and adding,\" \"exploring and circulating,\"\nA thousand kinds, ten thousand forms—\nAll merely different labels.\n\nIf one knows that the golden elixir is formless,\nThat medicinal substances have no name,\nThat fire phases have no fixed time,\nThat withdrawing and adding involve no action—\nOne who can grasp this\nDoes not cling to any single method\nNor lean toward one side.\nUtterly unburdened, not a trace remains,\nVast and luminous, the spirit-light shines universally.\nOnly then does one reach the path of spontaneity,\nEnter the gate of the great Dao,\nAnd understand that \"non-doing\" is true doing—\nCalled the \"exploration without exploration.\"\n\nFor example:\nNurturing life without knowing nature\nIs like a spirit in the valley.\nSeeing nature without preserving the body\nIs like a yin ghost without light.\nIf one can make nature true and life complete,\nOne is called an immortal of virtue and power.\n\n[Song of the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir]\nThe golden fluid, returned elixir, flows with immortal splendor,\nSoaring high, ascending the celestial mounds.\nThe red and yellow substances form in an instant,\nAt that moment, yin and yang divide the chaotic pearl.\nOne can then transform and summon the traveling kitchen,\nWith spirit-people and jade maidens accompanying me.\nEntering and exiting without question, in harmony with heaven,\nIts essence congeals like frost, skillfully rising and sinking.\nYou must be reverent and respectful—it will surely come to visit.\n\nFor those who wish to cultivate the true, nurture nature,\nPractice the Dao, refine the form,\nAnd congeal the black to become spirit,\nWith a beginning and end that are endless—\nNothing precedes stillness.\nThus, stilling nature establishes stability,\nStilling spirit enables transformation,\nStilling the black engenders life.\n\nWhen cultivating stillness,\nTurn inward to listen and observe,\nLet the heart not entertain reckless thoughts,\nThe mouth not speak reckless words,\nThe body not make reckless movements.\nThe color of no-color is seen,\nThe sound of no-sound is heard,\nThe flavor of no-flavor is savored,\nThe teaching of no-words is imparted.\nDivine radiance descends,\nFortune and virtue arrive,\nHarmonious qi responds.\n\nIf you wish to still the spirit,\nFirst bathe and fast for twenty-five days,\nThen refine your body,\nHarmonize hun and po,\nAnd only then enter the chamber.\nAfter entering,\nPerhaps a cinnabar snake will enter your heart,\nOr the Queen Mother descend,\nOr a Dao-body manifest—\nThese are all spirits within your body testing you.\nDo not be startled or afraid;\nIf questioned, do not answer;\nIf harmed or offended, do not fear.\nSimply calm the heart and settle the mind,\nAnd the beings will depart on their own.\n\nAfter twenty-five days, forty-five days, eighty-five days,\nOne hundred and five days, one hundred and twenty-five days,\nOne hundred and fifty days, one hundred and eighty days,\nSpirits will come—all testing you.\nSimply remain calm and do not respond;\nThey cannot harm you.\nIf you feel fear,\nYou will fail the test\nAnd lose the Dao.\nBe cautious, be vigilant.\n\nAfter one hundred and eighty days,\nThe chamber will brighten on its own,\nAnd you will foreknow safety and danger, life and death.\nThe palaces within your body will all become visible.\nAfter two hundred and eighty days,\nAll illnesses will be cured.\nAfter one year,\nScars will vanish.\nAfter a thousand days,\nForm and spirit will both be wondrous,\nAnd you will unite with the sagely and true.\n\nVerification of the Golden Elixir\n\nFirst:\nAfter great effort,\nOne must diligently guard for a hundred days,\nAbiding in a quiet chamber,\nExternally unattached,\nInternally free of thought.\nThe body like withered wood,\nThe heart like cold ashes,\nAll conditions suddenly cease,\nMerging with the great void,\nUsing the spirit-light,\nDay and night cherishing it.\nAfter three to five days,\nThe heart naturally settles,\nThe black harmonizes,\nJoy is boundless,\nHumility and reverence toward others arise.\nThe sages spoke of five-day intervals.\n\nSecond:\nSuddenly, one feels the heart-fire descend,\nThe kidney-water ascend,\nThe five viscera generate fluids,\nThe hundred vessels flow freely,\nThe heart meridian surges upward,\nThe nose detects strange fragrances,\nThe tongue produces sweet saliva,\nHunger and thirst cease,\nSleep vanishes day and night.\n\nThird:\nKan and Li unite in marriage,\nEssence and black reverse their course,\nAll gates open,\nQi flows harmoniously through the four limbs and hundred vessels.\n\nFourth:\nAt night, it is as bright as day,\nOne sees through walls,\nForeknows human affairs,\nBeholds heaven above,\nViews hell below,\nNothing obstructs—\nThis is the reach of the spirit-light.\n\n第五：\nAt night, the elixir field comes alive,\nConnecting in front to the black courtyard,\nBehind to the secret gate,\nRed mist swirls above the crown,\nA halo emerges between the brows,\nThe eyes shine with radiant clarity.\n\nSixth:\nDo not regard this as strange—it is the power of the medicine taking effect.\nThe spirit of wisdom leaps and dances,\nSinging and reciting verses of its own accord,\nUttering wild words—\nThis cannot be restrained,\nFor it is the work of the Three Corpses.\nIf not guarded against, all prior efforts will be undone.\n\nSeventh:\nNow joyful, now sorrowful,\nLaughing and conversing with others,\nDiscoursing on mysteries and expounding the Dao—\nThis too is the delusion wrought by the Three Household Demons.\n\nEighth:\nThough the hundred gates are open,\nThe five grains’ blackness is not yet purged,\nYin’s blackness not yet exhausted,\nIllness not yet dispelled.\nThe practitioner must swear an oath to Heaven,\nRefine the heart with utmost dedication,\nSever attachments to love and desire,\nAbandon self and others,\nAnd hold no partiality toward things.\nWith right mindfulness ever present,\nInner and outer become as one,\nSeizing Heaven and Earth’s true qi,\nDrawing out yin to exchange for yang.\nAppetite may wax or wane,\nTurbid flows stream unceasing from the nose,\nThe mouth emits foul odors,\nWith restlessness, retching, and nausea.\nWithin the abdomen, constant ascent and descent,\nThunder roars, lightning strikes,\nWind and clouds burst forth,\nQi surges both fore and aft.\nThe grains are refined into silver paste,\nLike pellets strung together.\nFrom the intestines and stomach, foul impurities are smelted out,\nTheir stench unbearable.\nThen, as they swirl downward,\nA creamy, oily slick descends,\nIts fragrance rich and strange—\nAll who draw near can smell it.\nUrine flows in five hues of cinnabar.\nThis is the theft of the myriad things.\nIf not vigilantly guarded, the blackness may scatter.\nShould the heart grow lax and the body weak,\nThe Three Corpses will rise as one,\nThe Six Wastrels all converge,\nDisturbing the heart’s spirit.\nIn quiet sitting, doubt arises,\nFear and unease take hold,\nSleep is broken by startling dreams,\nAnd evil visions know no end.\nDwell in a secluded chamber,\nStrictly avoid foul odors,\nAll manner of fragrances,\nAnd miscellaneous impurities.\nAlso shun raw, cold, or hard foods,\nAs well as the salty, savory, pungent, and sour.\nFailure to do so will damage\nThe true blackness of the five viscera.\nWhen the five viscera’s blackness is restored,\nIts ascent and descent flow without obstruction,\nThe hundred vessels course freely,\nPrimordial qi fills the abdomen,\nHunger and thirst naturally cease,\nNeither famine nor thirst is felt.\nGradually, one may feel stifled—\nDo not regard this as strange.\nAfter the seventh day,\nVitality grows stronger,\nThe spirit becomes clear and the blackness bright,\nSleeplessness persists day and night,\nUntil the myriad spirits fall utterly silent,\nAnd blackness returns to the primal sea—\nOnly then does the appetite return.\nHaving resumed the five grains,\nAll flavors must be strictly avoided,\nFor they harm the generative blackness.\nThe initial rinsing blackness\nCannot contend with the grains’ blackness.\nShould illness suddenly strike,\nPerverse qi assails the heart,\nThe Triple Burner falls out of harmony,\nThe five qi fail to arise,\nThe three barriers seal shut,\nAppetite wanes.\nCold and heat come in their seasons,\nYet wax and wane unpredictably,\nThe mouth turns sour and astringent,\nNeither ascent nor descent occurs.\nBetween heart and lungs,\nStagnation congeals into blood,\nWhich may suddenly surge upward in retching,\nExpelling cups of purple-black blood—\nThe illness then gradually recedes.\nSaliva may suddenly swell upward,\nThen descend the Tower of Nectar,\nTo be swallowed in an instant,\nIts fragrance exquisite,\nWashing clean the Triple Burner,\nThe five viscera and six bowels,\nThe hundred gates and spirit cavities—\nAll become crystalline and free-flowing.\nThe Three Fields reverse their course,\nThe Silver River gleams bright,\nPearls gush forth,\nAll illnesses vanish—\nThis is the mending of Heaven’s loss.\nEach year, when consuming the five grains,\nThe mouth constantly savors their fragrance,\nThe heart-spirit is harmonious and joyful.\nWith every circulation,\nThe hundred vessels align,\nThe four seasons are at peace,\nNaturally attuned to Heaven and Earth’s\nMovement of yin and yang,\nThe intervals of the sun and moon’s passage,\nThe cycles of day and night—\nNone deviate from their measure.\nWithin the ears, wind howls,\nThe heart is startled and fearful,\nThunder crashes, lightning flashes,\nFire engulfs the body,\nSmelting the golden essence,\nThe host of yin disperses,\nThe Three Corpses vanish without trace,\nThe elixir field’s blackness harmonizes,\nSpirits gather in the Central Palace.\nWithin, the nature is unseen,\nWithout, the form is invisible.\nIn the realm of the indistinct,\nLike a cat seizing a mouse,\nIn the depths of the unfathomable,\nLike a roc snatching a hare—\nThe fire passes through the clear and cold.\nAppetite wanes,\nGradually giving rise to signs of emaciation.\nNow rising, now descending,\nThe navel and abdomen ache,\nThe cheeks feel as if pierced by awls,\nThe six bowels resound like tearing silk.\nThese are the latent illnesses of the viscera,\nAssailed by the medicine’s power,\nAll erupting at once,\nWith constant parched thirst.\nDrink licorice decoction,\nBut strictly avoid all else.\nThe five spirits grow unclear,\nThe chest and diaphragm feel stifled,\nThe heart is in a daze,\nSleep is restless—\nDo not regard this as strange.\nSimply focus the heart and guard it,\nSlowly expelling foul and strange impurities,\nAnd the illness will gradually recede.\nAt times, when the hundred gates are unobstructed,\nThe myriad spirits assemble,\nThe five blacknesses all merge,\nReturning to the primal sea—\nNaturally, all becomes still.\nBreath no longer passes through mouth or nose,\nPulse no longer resides in the inch and bar—\nThis is true great stillness.\nIf stillness is perfected for a full hundred moments,\nOne becomes a Great Luo Immortal.\nShould illness arise in the body,\nLike fire steaming the Four Great Elements,\nDay and night, one is dazed and stifled,\nUnconscious,\nEvery joint aching,\nPain as if pounded to pieces,\nFire scorching and refining,\nSinews and bones like silk—\nThen, suddenly, sweat breaks,\nAnd all is well.\nThis is true shedding.\nOnly when water and fire share the furnace,\nThe five blacknesses unite as one,\nThe Four Great Elements are free of yin,\nPure yang flows through,\nThe golden liquid refines the form,\nForm and spirit both become wondrous,\nAnd merge with the Dao in truth—\nThe five phases become useless,\nThe spirit roams the immortal realms,\nBeyond the world, carefree and unbound.\nWhen true qi is fully replete,\nYin naturally vanishes,\nThe divine light thereafter envelops the body,\nThe hundred vessels surge in harmony,\nA thousand streams of joyous sound arise,\nYin demons are utterly dispelled—\nThis is the verification of cultivating the true.\nWherever one goes, sages and worthies are dispatched to attend,\nGolden writs and purple decrees arrive in due time,\nThe body remains in the mortal realm,\nYet the heart abides in the sacred.\n**Names of the Golden Elixir**\nDrawing it into the Central Palace\nIs called \"drilling and clustering the five phases.\"\nWhen body and heart remain unmoved,\nIt is called \"subduing the Dragon and Tiger.\"\nWhen the Dragon hums, essence congeals;\nWhen the Tiger roars, qi solidifies—\nThis is called \"preserving the numinous root.\"\nTaking essence and qi as the Tortoise and Serpent,\nBody and heart as the Dragon and Tiger,\nForging them into one—\nThis is called \"harmonizing the Four Images.\"\n\nWith nature governing emotion, it is called \"Metal and Wood in Parallel.\"\nWith emotion guiding qi, it is called \"Water and Fire in Union.\"\nRefining essence into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into emptiness—\nThis is called \"Three Flowers Gathering in the Tripod.\"\n\nEvery thought and impulse is called the \"Mysterious Female.\"\nThe nature within the heart is called \"Mercury within Cinnabar.\"\nThe qi within the body is called \"Gold within Water.\"\n\nWhen external realms do not enter and internal realms do not exit,\nIt is called \"Sealing and Steadfastness.\"\nWhen utterly still and unmoving,\nIt is called \"Nurturing the Fire.\"\nWhen empty and spontaneous,\nIt is called \"Activation.\"\nWhen sincerity and resolve are preserved,\nIt is called \"Guarding the City.\"\nWhen inner demons are subdued,\nIt is called \"Field Battle.\"\nWhen the heart is cleansed and thoughts purified,\nIt is called \"Bathing.\"\nWhen sitting upright in meditative absorption,\nIt is called \"Gathering and Refining.\"\n\nDrawing the yang from Kan to replenish the yin in Li\nIs called \"Withdrawing and Adding.\"\nWhere the Four Great and Five Phases do not adhere,\nIt is called the \"Mysterious Pass.\"\nThe single point of numinous light before Heaven and Earth divided\nIs called the \"True Seed.\"\n\nWhen spirit dwells in the Qian Palace,\nQi in the Central Palace,\nAnd essence in the Kun Palace,\nIt is called the \"Three Palaces.\"\n\nThe aperture of returning to the root,\nThe gate of reviving the mandate,\nThe valley of emptiness—\nThese are called the \"Three Essentials.\"\n\nThe body is the furnace and tripod,\nThe heart is the chamber of spirit,\nLead and mercury are the medicinal substances.\n\nWithin the body, that which rises and blazes above\nIs called \"Fire\"—the qi within essence.\nWithin the body, that which descends and moistens below\nIs called \"Water\"—the fluid within qi.\n\nCurbing anger causes fire to descend,\nRestraining desire causes water to rise—\nThis is called \"Completion.\"\nFailing to curb anger causes fire to blaze upward,\nFailing to restrain desire causes water to sink downward—\nThis is called \"Incompletion.\"\n\nTrue lead is called the \"Infant Boy\"—the essence within the kidneys.\nTrue mercury is called the \"Olden Maiden\"—the blood within the heart.\nEmbryonic breathing is called the \"Yellow Dame\"—the saliva within the spleen.\nEmotion and nature are called \"Husband and Wife.\"\n\nThe primordial spirit, indestructible through kalpas,\nHard as metal, growing ever brighter with refinement—\nThis is called the \"Golden Elixir.\"\nNine is the completion number of metal;\nEmotion pertains to metal,\nEmotion returning to nature—\nThis is called \"Ninefold Return.\"\nSeven is the completion number of fire;\nSpirit pertains to fire,\nRefining spirit into emptiness—\nThis is called \"Sevenfold Reversion.\"\n\nWhen the heart is serene and intent settled,\nNature still and spirit numinous,\nThe two substances form a mass.\nThe Three Primes converge—\nThis is called \"Forming the Embryo.\"\n\nCherish the numinous root\nAs a dragon tends its pearl,\nAs a hen broods her egg,\nGuarding it with utmost care,\nLest the slightest error occur.\nA hair’s breadth of deviation\nRenders all prior effort void.\n\nWhen the yang spirit emerges from the husk,\nIt is called \"Shedding the Embryo.\"\nReturning to the root, reviving the mandate,\nRestoring the original state—\nThis is called \"Transcendence.\"\nShattering emptiness—\nThis is called \"Completion.\"\n\n*Collected Essentials of the Inner Elixir of the Perfected, Scroll

Pool into the Golden Chamber they flow,\nRound as a pellet, hue like the tangerine,\nWithin lies a savor sweet as honey.\nThe śramaṇa attains it through dhyāna,\nThe yellow-robed through transcendence.\nShould you obtain it, guard it well—\nLose it once, and your body shall perish.\nAscend the hidden pass, thrice winding,\nEnter the Gate of Life, form unwearied,\nDeep and fathomless, hard to entreat.\n\nSun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nAll the ten thousand images, bright and clear.\nBefore the Three-Five, after the Three-Five,\nFive-Six makes thirty, returning to life.\nLife and decay cycle through twelve,\nTwelve divides into twenty-four.\nThe twenty-four qi shift in turn,\nAll hexagrams and lines reside herein.\n\nQuicksilver, one flavor, splits in two,\nPaired with the yin bowels, consummation nears.\nOnce consummated, they become husband and wife,\nThen one perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.\nRed lead and black tin form the Great Elixir’s head,\nFrom red to black is true cultivation.\nFrom black extract the essence, from red the marrow,\nResolving red and black, the medicine is peerless.\nTake red into black to preserve longevity,\nUse black into red, and you become a Heavenly Immortal.\nInverting the two completes the return,\nThe Fire Dragon transforms into a Heavenly Immortal.\n\nStudents of the Dao, reflect on yourselves—\nDo not transmit this to the greedy or lustful.\nAt Hangu Pass, at Liangshan’s mouth,\nI now carve this stone to leave these words.\n\n---\n\n### *Song of the Returned Elixir by Immortal Zhongli of Zhengyang*\nOne mother bears two children,\nOne boy and one girl.\nThe boy is the root of yin, the girl the lord of yang.\nWhen yin comes, yang abides,\nNever losing their primal ancestry.\nThe spleen grinds, food digests itself,\nReturning to the fertile earth.\nStudents are as numerous as hemp,\nBut the enlightened span past and present.\nSeeing the dragon yet not knowing the dragon,\nEncountering the tiger yet not knowing the tiger.\nThe dragon is not in the eastern dusk,\nThe tiger not in the western barbarians.\nIf you seek from the one source,\nBrightly you will know what is hidden or revealed.\nIf you search east and west,\nEven with eyes, you are as blind.\n\nYang resides in yin’s womb,\nYin in yang’s belly.\nThe boy is white, the girl red,\nNaturally they become husband and wife.\nPlant hemp, harvest hemp;\nPlant millet, harvest millet.\nIf you do not recognize lead,\nYour white-haired years will be full of toil.\n\nVague and indistinct,\nThe two things are hard to covet.\nDim and obscure,\nThe three clans seem like kin and performers.\nPassion unites the myriad medicines,\nQi harmonizes without words.\nSmelt lead and mercury until dry,\nLike a cat crouching over a mouse.\n\n---\n\n### *Song of Stone Bridge by Immortal Zhang Ziyang*\nMy home lies north of Stone Bridge,\nWhere mountains lock and waters bar, ancient trees stand dense.\nBeneath the bridge, the ravine’s waters flow to Kunlun,\nThose who drink the spring find its fragrance rich.\nMy dwelling within the mountains is truly boastworthy,\nThe narrow land all planted with unfading flowers.\nNorth of the mountain, a cave hides a fierce tiger,\nEmerging from its den, it roars, birthing clouds and mist.\nSouth of the mountain, the pool’s depths conceal a flood dragon,\nSoaring through clouds, it descends rain, the sky grows dim.\nThe two beasts sometimes battle,\nThe Mysterious Pearl flies and hides, revealing auspicious signs.\n\nThe scene is fair, I rejoice in secret,\nPouring my own wine, I grow mellow with drink.\nDrunk, I pluck a stringless zither,\nIts notes teach me to listen closely.\nOh, the drunkenness—let none know!\nDazed and silent, I seem a fool.\nGazing up, I marvel at the workings of creation,\nThe sun sets in the west, the moon rises in the east.\n\nHeaven is earth, earth is heaven,\nInverting yin and yang accords with nature.\nRecognize where the Five Phases invert,\nAnd you shall ascend the rosy clouds to return to the Grotto-Heaven.\nA house of gold, beams of white jade,\nGolden Lads and Jade Maidens attend before you.\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are arrayed in clarity,\nThe ten thousand images of the cosmos appear boundless.\n\nNo day or night, only ceaseless continuity,\nGathering and dispersing, the celestial fire-timing is complete.\nShould you wish to know the true locus of the Golden Elixir,\nSeek a master to reveal the lead within water.\n\nWater begets fire, fire begets water,\nWater and fire must distinguish front and rear ranks.\nTo discern ascent and descent, know host and guest,\nLead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.\n\nThere is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,\nKnowing contentment, ever content, return to your root.\nAll ministers celebrate the Heavenly Peace,\nWhen weary, the nation prospers, the people rejoice.\n\nThis song is fine for contemplation,\nThose of the same Dao will grasp its meaning.\nLater generations of cultivators,\nAre but storing thoughts and circulating qi.\nAt hand, it is most easy,\nWithin daily use, it is your own.\nEven if predecessors had fifty years,\nI ask you: what did they study before?\n\nThis one gate holds savor,\nThose who ingest it find its wonders unmatched.\nFirst it dispels illness, then extends years,\nUsing fire to refine, transforming the yang body.\nStudents of the Dao, reflect on yourselves—\nDo not be constrained by heterodox minor methods.\nKnowing only to awe others in the moment,\nUnaware of your own hidden withering.\n\nI exhort later learners, be resolute in will,\nDo not idly abandon home to wander distant lands.\nThe wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body,\nHow could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?\n\nDo not procrastinate, indulging in greed and baseness,\nHasten to seek a master and grasp the Mysterious Pointer.\nIf in this life you do not learn to cultivate life,\nWho knows what womb you may inhabit in the next?\n\nSince you have the heart, see it through to the end,\nThe great matter of human life is only life and death.\nIf august Heaven betrays the Daoist’s heart,\nIt will plunge me into the Three Wretched Realms as a lowly ghost.\n\n---\n\n### *Golden Stone Paper Pavilion by Ma Ziran*\nAt the eastern edge of the great sea, the red solar wheel,\nHow many times have green mountains been ground to dust?\nA hundred years hold thirty-six thousand days,\nEach day, how many die and are born?\n\nThe Nine-Turned Numinous Elixir is not of the Five Metals,\nWithout divine transmission, it is hard to seek.\nShould you wish to know the true immortal formula of mother and child,\nFirst refine the medicine by learning to refine the heart.\n\nWhy strive to burn elixirs to preserve youth?\nBustle is not the marketplace, stillness is not the mountains.",

in sequence, it forms a person.\nAt the sprouting of the first yang, act swiftly,\nExtract the white from the black, the existent from the nonexistent.\nWithin an hour, the elixir is complete,\nNine years and three years of mere waiting are in vain.\n\nIf people truly knew the Mysterious Female,\nIt is neither in the heart nor the kidneys.\nTrace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth,\nNo wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.\n\n*Great Elixir Song by Pure Yang True Man*\nThe Three Clarities’ palaces lie hidden atop Kunlun’s peaks,\nSun and moon float in radiance, surpassing purple mist.\nPools and ponds brim with jade-like liquid,\nPavilions and terraces circulate divine springs in layers.\n\nThe Azure Dragon rides fire, lead becomes water,\nThe White Tiger surges waves, mercury turns to lead.\nTo seek the Kan male’s mate,\nRely on the Li female to forge the bond.\n\nThe Yellow Dame exhausts a thousand schemes,\nThe golden crucible blooms with a single lotus.\nThe chaste woman holds the crow on the left,\nThe general wears the hare to guard the west.\n\nThe Black Tortoise crouches beneath the red furnace,\nThe Vermilion Bird perches before the Flowery Pavilion.\nThen, calming the spirit to glimpse the reflection,\nAfter three cycles, the work is done, and one rides the cloud-cake.\n\n*Song of Nature and Life*\nTo refine the golden elixir without comprehending nature,\nThis is the foremost malady in cultivation.\nTo refine only the true nature without refining the elixir,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.\n\nGrasping life’s foundation yet losing ancestral nature,\nIs like a mirror without its precious reflection.\nA man whose life spans Heaven and Earth,\nWields yin and yang as his fundamental handle.\n\nWhen nature and life are complete, it is profound and mysterious,\nThe great waves at the sea’s bottom ferry the Dharma boat.\nOnly when the dragon’s head is captured alive,\nDoes one know the master craftsman’s skill is no empty boast.\n\n*Rhapsody on the Golden Elixir by Immortal Lord Li*\nThe Dao originally has no form, the elixir arises naturally.\nOnce it soars and reveals its treasure,\nOne consumes it to ascend as an immortal.\n\nSeize the two things within the furnace, called Dragon and Tiger;\nEnclose the five phases within the cave, distinct as mountains and rivers.\nOf old, men wandered the land of mystery,\nEmbracing the art of the True One.\n\nDesiring longevity like Heaven and Earth,\nDesiring a body as firm as metal and stone,\nThey gathered the essence of mercury,\nRefined the substance of lead.\n\nForged with great fire,\nAdvancing fills, retreating empties;\nStored in the central palace,\nHarvested in due time, used on appointed days.\n\nThus, the marrow of the west’s geng and xin,\nThe essence of the east’s jia and yi,\nEmit purity, nurture excellence, bloom like flowers, flourish like herbs.\nObserve its body—united yet distinct,\nProbe its wonder—congealed and complete.\n\nThe Li female and Kan male,\nPaired, they ultimately defy death;\nThe sun crow and moon hare,\nComing and going, they naturally attain long life.\n\nThe eight trigrams array around,\nThe nine palaces stand in formation.\nThree hundred sixty days,\nWith shifting seasons and nodes;\nTwenty-eight constellations,\nWithout repeated paths or fixed degrees.\n\nMercury subdues lead, lead subdues mercury,\nThe source of creation is hard to fathom;\nYang arises from yin, yin arises from yang,\nWho can discern the numbers of their shifts?\n\nVast and obscure, within lies the Great Clarity.\nFrom formlessness, form is born,\nFrom namelessness, a name is forced.\nThose who know its mechanism can steal the workings of creation;\nThose who misunderstand its principle merely waste true primordial essence.\n\nRefined through the nine returns,\nOne transcends the mortal to enter sagehood;\nSwallowing a single grain,\nOne reverses aging to become an infant.\n\nAlas! Ancient gallops and modern races,\nMorning dashes and evening toils.\nHousehold after household casts aside white snow,\nEach and every one discards the yellow sprout.\nThe pure light departs and cannot be detained,\nThe rosy complexion fades and is hard to restore.\n\nReflecting on the awakening from the southern bough’s dream,\nWealth and honor are unreliable;\nContemplating the northern mound’s lofty tomb,\nMerit and fame crumble in vain.\n\nSome refine cinnabar into purple powder,\nSmelt black tin to obtain dark frost.\nSome dine on mist and feed on auroras,\nOr abstain from grain to cease eating.\nAll claim supreme medicine,\nYet none follow the ancient methods.\n\nHow is this different from seeking fish in green trees?\nThe higher the tree, the more the fish elude;\nOr drilling ice for fire?\nThe deeper the ice, the more fire vanishes.\n\nLittle do they know:\nThe body is the palace of qi,\nQi is the abode of spirit.\nContinuing true qi with true qi, the spirit does not scatter;\nSupplementing true essence with true essence, the form has a master.\n\nNaturally, white bones grow flesh, and withered skeletons revive,\nOne can chase after Red Pine and follow Peng Zu.\n\n*Azure Dragon Song by Heavenly Master Tian*\nHeavenly Master Tian was originally a carefree wanderer,\nIn youth, he studied Confucian books and revered official virtues.\nHad it not been for past-life ties to immortality,\nHow could he have received the true master’s wondrous formula?\n\nThe wondrous formula, few words spoken,\nBefore parting, he entrusted me with the pot’s song.\nThe song does not speak in common language,\nIt teaches the gathering of immortals’ deathless art.\n\nOne medicine, rootless and beginningless,\nThe primordial qi of before Heaven.\nExpounding profound principles, there are alchemical texts,\n*The Awakening to Reality* and *The Kinship of the Three*.\n*The Kinship of the Three* speaks of immortal methods,\nThe Later Han’s true man, Wei Boyang.\nUsing the *Book of Changes* to elucidate the great medicine,\nLeft as the king of elixirs for ten thousand ages.\n\nThe essence of sun and moon, the marrow of Heaven and Earth,\nEncompass the profound principles of the golden elixir.",

      "translated_text": "Words subtle, prose plain, the Dao profound and deep—\nWithout true transmission, how could one fathom its mystery?\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* speaks with utter clarity:\nThe celestial immortal’s formula for life eternal.\nThe Patriarch of Purple Yang, pitying those to come,\nRevealed the celestial mechanism once more.\n\nMan grows old, the crow caws in vain,\nIts cry passing north of Black Crow Mountain, then farther west.\nIn *Spring in the Qin Garden*, the heartbreaking verse:\n\"Begin swift cultivation—yet even now, it may be too late.\"\n\nTo cultivate, to seek the great Dao,\nNever mistake the Three Peaks for karmic retribution.\nThree thousand six hundred are but side doors;\nApart from the golden elixir, all are false constructs.\n\nProclaim the great Dao, spread the mystic wind,\nRevive the lineage of the southwest for an age.\nShould one ask the immortal elder’s true lineage,\nHe was originally known as Purple Yang of Mount Zhu.\n\nLong ago, the immortal elder suffered exile,\nBy chance in Yaolin he transmitted the secret to Shi Tu.\nLater in Piling, he passed it to Niwan,\nAnd Jade Toad’s ancestral name was thus established.\n\nAlas for the dusty world, a flower in the mirror,\nA human life—how many years can it last?\nTo restore the original true countenance,\nSeek the root sprout where the Five Agents have no place.\n\nSeek the root sprout—do so early,\nLest your own lead and mercury dwindle.\nYear after year passes, growing ever fewer,\nWaters flow, flowers fall, and man ages in vain.\n\nMan grows old—if he would cultivate,\nWhat need for precepts or scripture-reading?\nOnly cast aside discrimination, uproot love and hate,\nAnd with an impartial mind, the Dao will naturally flourish.\n\nTo cultivate, endure humiliation willingly,\nLet spittle dry on your face without retaliation.\nIf I wrong another, calamity will extend;\nIf another wrongs me, it turns to blessing.\n\nIn seeking the great Dao, embody unyielding metal,\nLet hardship and worry never stir the heart.\nWealth and poverty, high and low—Heaven has ordained them;\nLose or gain, sink or float—let it be.\n\nTo cultivate, there are tasks to perform:\nTo learn the Dao, first learn to sit in meditation.\nYet if one sits in dry emptiness, it is still in vain—\nDrawing cakes to allay hunger only leaves one starving.\n\nTo learn the great Dao, prepare the elixir chamber,\nThe room must be secluded, the land must be auspicious.\nIf the land is not auspicious, the spirit will not abide;\nEven with the true seed, it will suffer harm.\n\nTo refine the elixir, one must find companions,\nThree like-minded souls to guard one another.\nWithout such comrades of the same resolve,\nThe great medicine will not form, and mercury will flee.\n\nTo learn the great Dao, seek a kindred spirit,\nThe elixir’s head must be the gold within water.\nWithout accumulated merit and hidden virtue,\nOne may wander the world’s edges yet find it nowhere.\n\nTo cultivate, await the proper time,\nHaving met the master’s transmission, do not act rashly.\nKeep it deeply hidden, never boast to others,\nLest you invite demonic hindrance and disrupt the great work.\n\nTo learn the great Dao, tend to the household,\nRely on gentleness and harmony to nurture the utmost truth.\nWhen the virtue of earth is thick, the elixir’s virtue is thick—\nSpeak only of concern for the Dao, not for poverty.\n\nIf one worries over poverty, the Dao is hard to discern;\nWhen the elixir way is complete, all such concerns vanish.\nRoam the four seas at will,\nFor the traveling kitchen will provide sustenance.\n\nTo cultivate the true, dwell amidst the mundane,\nNot by abandoning home or forsaking wife and daughter.\nClothing and food through the seasons must be supplied,\nAnd one must not shun the cold of dawn or the heat of dusk.\n\nAfter the elixir is complete, one may leave the household,\nDwelling in grotto palaces and famous mountains through the years.\nSleeping under dew, dining on wind, roaming sea isles,\nWith cloud shoes and moon staff, traverse the ends of the earth.\n\nTo cultivate, avoid incurring debt,\nFor who does not love wine, sex, wealth, and temper?\nOrdinary folk cling to these and harm their spirit;\nIf I love them, there is no obstacle.\n\nI love wine—yet I have immortal friends,\nNo need for measures or yeast jars.\nA fine brew from Snow Mountain,\nPoured into the gourd, it flows to the lips again and again.\n\nI love sex—yet mine differs from others’,\nNot seeking rest in the bridal chamber’s depths.\nWithin the brothel’s smoke and flowers, immortals hide;\nOn Vulture Peak’s assembly, seek Mahākāśyapa.\n\nI love wealth—yet mine comes from the Dao,\nNot to buy beauties or handsome talents.\nRather, buy a youth and a crone,\nTo sit in purity all day, refining the platform elixir.\n\nI love temper—yet mine holds power,\nNot like Xiang Yu contending for hegemony.\nSlay the flood dragon in the Eastern Ocean’s depths,\nExecute the tiger cub on Western Flower Mountain’s heights.\n\nThe dragon can chant, the tiger can roar,\nTo seize the tiger and capture the dragon, there is a knack.\nShould you doubt, ask Guanyin—\nThe dragon maiden’s pearl offering reveals the Dao’s wonder.\n\nThe tortoise can fly, the serpent can dance,\nHidden in the north, known as True Warrior.\nYin and yang blend as the essence of water and fire,\nImmortal sages descend to become the Dao’s ancestors.\n\nThe root of nature, the stem of life,\nThough named differently, they emerge from one source.\nUnite them in one place to form the elixir,\nReturning to the primordial qi of before Heaven.\n\nThe stem of life, the root of nature,\nThe primordial,

late from the Jade Pool’s feast,\nOne steals a sweet peach of immortality.\n\nTo gather the herb, one must recognize the moon in the heavens;\nTo refine the elixir, one must know the gold within the water.\nIf the moon lacks the *geng* qi or gold lacks water,\nEven with true lead, one’s efforts are in vain.\n\nPlant the seed in the Valley of No Death,\nUpon the rootless tree, flowers bloom of themselves.\nA single fruit of primordial chaos is formed—\nSwallowed into the cinnabar field, it blazes like fiery mist.\n\nSince ancient times, few live to seventy,\nWhen the hexagram’s qi nears its end, none can reclaim it.\nTo begin cultivation swiftly is already too late;\nWhen impermanence arrives, regret comes too late.\n\nWealth and poverty, fate’s presence or absence—\nIn cultivation and discerning the Dao, subtle reckonings unfold.\nIf one does not strive to become a divine immortal,\nOne squanders the life of a true man.\n\nThe sacred proclamation of the Dao’s Primordial Heavenly Ancestor:\nClearly, dragon and tiger are the perfected truth.\nWho could have foreseen that in a dream upon Green Mountain,\nWithin the six directions, eternal spring is concealed?\n\nVast and unfeeling are the six paths of existence,\nYet from a single qi, the myriad transformations arise.\nDifferent names emerge from the same source—this is the root of the Dao;\nThe same source with different names—this is the name of the elixir.\n\nAtop the White Jade City, jade nectar is refined;\nWithin the golden crucible, golden lotuses are sown.\nWhen the fire is sufficient, the elixir forms with ease;\nAfter ten months of frost, the medicine must be firm.\n\nWhere the tiger roars on the mountain, wind arises;\nWhen the dragon intones in the sea’s depths, waves surge.\nAfter the tiger’s roar and dragon’s cry cease their battle,\nWind calms, waves still, and the infant is born.\n\nThe Azure Dragon rides the fire, soaring with the Vermilion Bird;\nThe Dark Warrior, hungry, devours the White Tiger’s gold.\nInverting *kan* and *li* depends on *wu* and *ji*;\nDrawing and adding rely on *bing* and *ren*.\n\nHalf a catty of true mercury, half a catty of lead—\nPrecisely at

is true deafness.\nIf one understands seeing others as seeing oneself,\nHearing as if not hearing—this is true wisdom.\n\nThe Jade Hare’s eastern descent brings heat;\nThe Golden Crow’s western rise brings cold.\nKnowing the marvel of inversion within the mysterious,\nDo not compare short and long before others.\n\nInversion begets reversal, reversal begets inversion—\nA nameless infant is born.\nTo know whose child this infant is,\nIt is the primordial essence before heaven and earth.\n\nThe wondrous vessel, once formed, is marvelously strange,\nEncompassing the myriad images, harmonizing with heaven’s mechanism.\nStars, constellations, sun, and moon turn with the mechanism—\nEven the inversion of heaven and earth goes unnoticed.\n\nSupreme virtue acts without striving, without contrivance;\nLesser virtue acts with effort, with purpose.\nIf one wishes the Dao to arise from supreme virtue,\nOne must first establish roots in lesser virtue.\n\nDo not boast of partial

Haichan’s True Man’s Song of Returning Elixir, Dispelling Delusion**\n\nI have heard that the world speaks of the golden elixir,\nMany study it, but few attain it.\nIt is not in water, nor in

drums—thousands of methods,\nYet the more one seeks the golden elixir, the harder it becomes to find.\n\nClosing the eyes, concealing the gaze, stilling thoughts—\nWhen it emerges from the mouth, one cannot hear it.\nTaking this as the method to ascend to heaven,\nOne finds it unrelated to true pain or joy.\n\nA hundred days of qi circulation yield no result,\nLeading only to old age and death in vain.\nThe sage circulates qi with natural rhythm,\nFor life and destiny are not obtained through qi alone.\n\nHolding the breath until the belly swells and the face turns sallow,\nExhausting the mind and strength in qi circulation—\nWho has ascended to heaven through qi circulation?\nWho has prolonged life through it?\nA thousand practice it, a thousand die—\nRefining the golden liquid is not like this.\n\nThe great Dao of immortals relies solely on the elixir,\nWhich can sustain one for a thousand years.\nThe thirty-six qi method for pacifying the spirit,\nBetween midnight and noon, ceaselessly applied.\n\nYet I sigh for fools who love to delve into Chan,\nCompeting in clever words through each sitting.\nEven with all the oral instructions, death cannot be avoided—\nTrue Buddha Dharma is not like this.\nThis *is* the true Buddha Dharma, the true Dao—\nOne child, two brothers.\n\nEmbracing the two qi to form a single elixir,\nWhere else would one seek the spirit?\nThe immortals’ true lead, true mercury, true dragon and tiger—\nWithout recognizing the *daogui*, one seeks in vain.\n\nThe method of union—one phrase—\nReveals lead and mercury, recognizes the golden elixir.\nIf the golden elixir is to be attained, it is not difficult,\nBut the human heart’s cunning breeds obscurity.\nSeeing it before one’s eyes yet not recognizing it truly,\nRecognizing it yet blaming the body for practicing qi circulation.\n\nIf one mistakenly practices qi circulation, when will it be mastered?\nThe golden elixir can be accomplished in a hundred days.\nThe three fields forever yield the yellow sprout,\nAnd for ten thousand years, the body remains unharmed.\n\nBetween midnight, perform four tasks,\nYin and yang descend together, all interconnected.\nExternally draw yin, internally embrace yang—\nInversion and contemplation lie entirely within oneself.\n\nWith the left hand, grasp the Azure Dragon’s head;\nWith the right, seize the White Tiger’s tail.\nAt once, it enters the mouth, gradually sweetening—\nOnly then does one know this substance’s fragrance and beauty.\n\nThis is the gold within water,\nMastering the mysterious gate, possessing the principle.\nThe myriad truths’ essential collection of inner elixirs, first scroll—**concludes**.\n\n*(Note: The title is incorrect.

      "translated_text": "The Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire Phases of the Golden Elixir\n\nSun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nTheir hexagrams revolving, most clearly shown.\nThree and five before, three and five behind,\nFive and six make thirty, then life returns anew.\nBorn and extinguished, cycling through twelve,\nTwelve divided yield twenty-four.\nThe twenty-four qi mutually shift and change,\nAll hexagrams and lines refined within this frame.\n\nQuicksilver, one flavor split in two,\nTransforms yin and yang to form *jiwei*.\n*Jiwei* then paired as husband and wife,\nOne perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.\n\nThe Perfected One of Pure Yang said:\nGreat indeed are these twelve verses,\nHarmonizing with the five thousand words.\nAt the very beginning, original nature\nIs the supreme spirit of primordial origin and form,\nThe one numinous essence that governs life.\nThe root-source of life’s stem is prior to heaven,\nThe formless supreme essence,\nThe one qi that preserves nature.\n\nSpirit and essence are the foundation of nature and life.\nThis one numinous true nature\nIs obscured by the heart.\nThe pure unity of life\nIs enslaved by the body.\nIf one can preserve the body so that life’s foundation is ever firm,\nAnd still the heart so that nature’s root is empty and numinous,\nHow can life be secure without nature?\nHow can nature be enduring without life?\nNature and life are originally one,\nYet in movement they become two.\nToday’s scholars each cling to one side.\nTo perfect the great Dao of the True,\nThere is nothing but the unity of nature and life.\nTo achieve this unity,\nOne must simply purify the heart and quiet the mind.\nWhen heart and mind are pure and still,\nThe myriad dharmas naturally return to their root.\n\nWhy is it that through countless generations,\nPeople cannot preserve their nature and life\nAnd realize the great Dao?\nBecause the heart follows things and drifts,\nNature is turned by things,\nThe mind covets beauty while life is lost to desire.\nThose who depart from these two realms\nCling to minor practices, acting and moving,\nGrasping heterodox methods, deludedly cultivating and striving.\nThey invoke the names of golden elixir and medicinal substances,\nTerms like \"withdrawing and adding,\" \"exploring and circulating,\"\nA thousand kinds, ten thousand forms—\nAll merely different labels.\n\nIf one knows that the golden elixir is formless,\nThat medicinal substances have no name,\nThat fire phases have no fixed time,\nThat withdrawing and adding involve no action—\nOne who can grasp this\nDoes not cling to any single method\nNor lean toward one side.\nUtterly unburdened, not a trace remains,\nVast and luminous, the spirit-light shines universally.\nOnly then does one reach the path of spontaneity,\nEnter the gate of the great Dao,\nAnd understand that \"non-doing\" is true doing—\nCalled the \"exploration without exploration.\"\n\nFor example:\nNurturing life without knowing nature\nIs like a spirit in the valley.\nSeeing nature without preserving the body\nIs like a yin ghost without light.\nIf one can make nature true and life complete,\nOne is called an immortal of virtue and power.\n\n[Song of the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir]\nThe golden fluid, returned elixir, flows with immortal splendor,\nSoaring high, ascending the celestial mounds.\nThe red and yellow substances form in an instant,\nAt that moment, yin and yang divide the chaotic pearl.\nOne can then transform and summon the traveling kitchen,\nWith spirit-people and jade maidens accompanying me.\nEntering and exiting without question, in harmony with heaven,\nIts essence congeals like frost, skillfully rising and sinking.\nYou must be reverent and respectful—it will surely come to visit.\n\nFor those who wish to cultivate the true, nurture nature,\nPractice the Dao, refine the form,\nAnd congeal the black to become spirit,\nWith a beginning and end that are endless—\nNothing precedes stillness.\nThus, stilling nature establishes stability,\nStilling spirit enables transformation,\nStilling the black engenders life.\n\nWhen cultivating stillness,\nTurn inward to listen and observe,\nLet the heart not entertain reckless thoughts,\nThe mouth not speak reckless words,\nThe body not make reckless movements.\nThe color of no-color is seen,\nThe sound of no-sound is heard,\nThe flavor of no-flavor is savored,\nThe teaching of no-words is imparted.\nDivine radiance descends,\nFortune and virtue arrive,\nHarmonious qi responds.\n\nIf you wish to still the spirit,\nFirst bathe and fast for twenty-five days,\nThen refine your body,\nHarmonize hun and po,\nAnd only then enter the chamber.\nAfter entering,\nPerhaps a cinnabar snake will enter your heart,\nOr the Queen Mother descend,\nOr a Dao-body manifest—\nThese are all spirits within your body testing you.\nDo not be startled or afraid;\nIf questioned, do not answer;\nIf harmed or offended, do not fear.\nSimply calm the heart and settle the mind,\nAnd the beings will depart on their own.\n\nAfter twenty-five days, forty-five days, eighty-five days,\nOne hundred and five days, one hundred and twenty-five days,\nOne hundred and fifty days, one hundred and eighty days,\nSpirits will come—all testing you.\nSimply remain calm and do not respond;\nThey cannot harm you.\nIf you feel fear,\nYou will fail the test\nAnd lose the Dao.\nBe cautious, be vigilant.\n\nAfter one hundred and eighty days,\nThe chamber will brighten on its own,\nAnd you will foreknow safety and danger, life and death.\nThe palaces within your body will all become visible.\nAfter two hundred and eighty days,\nAll illnesses will be cured.\nAfter one year,\nScars will vanish.\nAfter a thousand days,\nForm and spirit will both be wondrous,\nAnd you will unite with the sagely and true.\n\nVerification of the Golden Elixir\n\nFirst:\nAfter great effort,\nOne must diligently guard for a hundred days,\nAbiding in a quiet chamber,\nExternally unattached,\nInternally free of thought.\nThe body like withered wood,\nThe heart like cold ashes,\nAll conditions suddenly cease,\nMerging with the great void,\nUsing the spirit-light,\nDay and night cherishing it.\nAfter three to five days,\nThe heart naturally settles,\nThe black harmonizes,\nJoy is boundless,\nHumility and reverence toward others arise.\nThe sages spoke of five-day intervals.\n\nSecond:\nSuddenly, one feels the heart-fire descend,\nThe kidney-water ascend,\nThe five viscera generate fluids,\nThe hundred vessels flow freely,\nThe heart meridian surges upward,\nThe nose detects strange fragrances,\nThe tongue produces sweet saliva,\nHunger and thirst cease,\nSleep vanishes day and night.\n\nThird:\nKan and Li unite in marriage,\nEssence and black reverse their course,\nAll gates open,\nQi flows harmoniously through the four limbs and hundred vessels.\n\nFourth:\nAt night, it is as bright as day,\nOne sees through walls,\nForeknows human affairs,\nBeholds heaven above,\nViews hell below,\nNothing obstructs—\nThis is the reach of the spirit-light.\n\n第五：\nAt night, the elixir field comes alive,\nConnecting in front to the black courtyard,\nBehind to the secret gate,\nRed mist swirls above the crown,\nA halo emerges between the brows,\nThe eyes shine with radiant clarity.",

      "translated_text": "Sixth:\nDo not regard this as strange—it is the power of the medicine taking effect.\nThe spirit of wisdom leaps and dances,\nSinging and reciting verses of its own accord,\nUttering wild words—\nThis cannot be restrained,\nFor it is the work of the Three Corpses.\nIf not guarded against, all prior efforts will be undone.\n\nSeventh:\nNow joyful, now sorrowful,\nLaughing and conversing with others,\nDiscoursing on mysteries and expounding the Dao—\nThis too is the delusion wrought by the Three Household Demons.\n\nEighth:\nThough the hundred gates are open,\nThe five grains’ blackness is not yet purged,\nYin’s blackness not yet exhausted,\nIllness not yet dispelled.\nThe practitioner must swear an oath to Heaven,\nRefine the heart with utmost dedication,\nSever attachments to love and desire,\nAbandon self and others,\nAnd hold no partiality toward things.\nWith right mindfulness ever present,\nInner and outer become as one,\nSeizing Heaven and Earth’s true qi,\nDrawing out yin to exchange for yang.\nAppetite may wax or wane,\nTurbid flows stream unceasing from the nose,\nThe mouth emits foul odors,\nWith restlessness, retching, and nausea.\nWithin the abdomen, constant ascent and descent,\nThunder roars, lightning strikes,\nWind and clouds burst forth,\nQi surges both fore and aft.\nThe grains are refined into silver paste,\nLike pellets strung together.\nFrom the intestines and stomach, foul impurities are smelted out,\nTheir stench unbearable.\nThen, as they swirl downward,\nA creamy, oily slick descends,\nIts fragrance rich and strange—\nAll who draw near can smell it.\nUrine flows in five hues of cinnabar.\nThis is the theft of the myriad things.\nIf not vigilantly guarded, the blackness may scatter.\nShould the heart grow lax and the body weak,\nThe Three Corpses will rise as one,\nThe Six Wastrels all converge,\nDisturbing the heart’s spirit.\nIn quiet sitting, doubt arises,\nFear and unease take hold,\nSleep is broken by startling dreams,\nAnd evil visions know no end.\nDwell in a secluded chamber,\nStrictly avoid foul odors,\nAll manner of fragrances,\nAnd miscellaneous impurities.\nAlso shun raw, cold, or hard foods,\nAs well as the salty, savory, pungent, and sour.\nFailure to do so will damage\nThe true blackness of the five viscera.\nWhen the five viscera’s blackness is restored,\nIts ascent and descent flow without obstruction,\nThe hundred vessels course freely,\nPrimordial qi fills the abdomen,\nHunger and thirst naturally cease,\nNeither famine nor thirst is felt.\nGradually, one may feel stifled—\nDo not regard this as strange.\nAfter the seventh day,\nVitality grows stronger,\nThe spirit becomes clear and the blackness bright,\nSleeplessness persists day and night,\nUntil the myriad spirits fall utterly silent,\nAnd blackness returns to the primal sea—\nOnly then does the appetite return.\nHaving resumed the five grains,\nAll flavors must be strictly avoided,\nFor they harm the generative blackness.\nThe initial rinsing blackness\nCannot contend with the grains’ blackness.\nShould illness suddenly strike,\nPerverse qi assails the heart,\nThe Triple Burner falls out of harmony,\nThe five qi fail to arise,\nThe three barriers seal shut,\nAppetite wanes.\nCold and heat come in their seasons,\nYet wax and wane unpredictably,\nThe mouth turns sour and astringent,\nNeither ascent nor descent occurs.\nBetween heart and lungs,\nStagnation congeals into blood,\nWhich may suddenly surge upward in retching,\nExpelling cups of purple-black blood—\nThe illness then gradually recedes.\nSaliva may suddenly swell upward,\nThen descend the Tower of Nectar,\nTo be swallowed in an instant,\nIts fragrance exquisite,\nWashing clean the Triple Burner,\nThe five viscera and six bowels,\nThe hundred gates and spirit cavities—\nAll become crystalline and free-flowing.\nThe Three Fields reverse their course,\nThe Silver River gleams bright,\nPearls gush forth,\nAll illnesses vanish—\nThis is the mending of Heaven’s loss.\nEach year, when consuming the five grains,\nThe mouth constantly savors their fragrance,\nThe heart-spirit is harmonious and joyful.\nWith every circulation,\nThe hundred vessels align,\nThe four seasons are at peace,\nNaturally attuned to Heaven and Earth’s\nMovement of yin and yang,\nThe intervals of the sun and moon’s passage,\nThe cycles of day and night—\nNone deviate from their measure.\nWithin the ears, wind howls,\nThe heart is startled and fearful,\nThunder crashes, lightning flashes,\nFire engulfs the body,\nSmelting the golden essence,\nThe host of yin disperses,\nThe Three Corpses vanish without trace,\nThe elixir field’s blackness harmonizes,\nSpirits gather in the Central Palace.\nWithin, the nature is unseen,\nWithout, the form is invisible.\nIn the realm of the indistinct,\nLike a cat seizing a mouse,\nIn the depths of the unfathomable,\nLike a roc snatching a hare—\nThe fire passes through the clear and cold.\nAppetite wanes,\nGradually giving rise to signs of emaciation.\nNow rising, now descending,\nThe navel and abdomen ache,\nThe cheeks feel as if pierced by awls,\nThe six bowels resound like tearing silk.\nThese are the latent illnesses of the viscera,\nAssailed by the medicine’s power,\nAll erupting at once,\nWith constant parched thirst.\nDrink licorice decoction,\nBut strictly avoid all else.\nThe five spirits grow unclear,\nThe chest and diaphragm feel stifled,\nThe heart is in a daze,\nSleep is restless—\nDo not regard this as strange.\nSimply focus the heart and guard it,\nSlowly expelling foul and strange impurities,\nAnd the illness will gradually recede.\nAt times, when the hundred gates are unobstructed,\nThe myriad spirits assemble,\nThe five blacknesses all merge,\nReturning to the primal sea—\nNaturally, all becomes still.\nBreath no longer passes through mouth or nose,\nPulse no longer resides in the inch and bar—\nThis is true great stillness.\nIf stillness is perfected for a full hundred moments,\nOne becomes a Great Luo Immortal.\nShould illness arise in the body,\nLike fire steaming the Four Great Elements,\nDay and night, one is dazed and stifled,\nUnconscious,\nEvery joint aching,\nPain as if pounded to pieces,\nFire scorching and refining,\nSinews and bones like silk—\nThen, suddenly, sweat breaks,\nAnd all is well.\nThis is true shedding.\nOnly when water and fire share the furnace,\nThe five blacknesses unite as one,\nThe Four Great Elements are free of yin,\nPure yang flows through,\nThe golden liquid refines the form,\nForm and spirit both become wondrous,\nAnd merge with the Dao in truth—\nThe five phases become useless,\nThe spirit roams the immortal realms,\nBeyond the world, carefree and unbound.\nWhen true qi is fully replete,\nYin naturally vanishes,\nThe divine light thereafter envelops the body,\nThe hundred vessels surge in harmony,\nA thousand streams of joyous sound arise,\nYin demons are utterly dispelled—\nThis is the verification of cultivating the true.\nWherever one goes, sages and worthies are dispatched to attend,\nGolden writs and purple decrees arrive in due time,\nThe body remains in the mortal realm,\nYet the heart abides in the sacred.\n**Names of the Golden Elixir**\nDrawing it into the Central Palace\nIs called \"drilling and
