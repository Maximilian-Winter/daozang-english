  "full_translation": "*The Secret Essentials of the Yellow Plain Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity: An Exegesis*\n\n**Title:** *The Secret Essentials of the Yellow Plain Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity: An Exegesis*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Section of Mysteries (*Dongxuan Bu*), Category of Methods\n\n---\n\nDisciple Fang Wen, bowing reverently to the Perfected Master, ventures to inquire about several matters in the *Yellow Plain Scripture*, humbly beseeching the Jade Decree to reveal the root and origin with luminous instruction.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The five qi ascend to the Origin; the three yang gather at the crown.\"*\n\nFang Wen observes that the Perfected Immortal Zhongli and the Perfected Immortal Lü, in their *Anthology on the Transmission of the Dao*, speak of refining the great elixir of golden cinnabar, saying: *\"The five qi ascend to the Origin; the three flowers gather at the crown.\"* The five qi are inseparable from the five phases—or, it is said, the five viscera. Here it is called the \"three yang,\" while there it is called the \"three flowers.\" Yang is also qi. Moreover, all yang in the human body gathers at the head, and the qi of the five viscera naturally ascends to the Mud Pill Palace. Thus, the eyes can see, the ears can hear, the nose can smell, and the tongue can taste. Yet in the refinement of the golden elixir, it is said: *\"The five qi ascend to the Origin; the three flowers gather at the crown.\"* I fear there may be a distinct transformation at work. I humbly beg for clear instruction.\n\nThe five qi are the qi of the five viscera, which converge and ascend to the Origin Palace. The Origin Palace refers to the lower elixir field. When the lower elixir field is firmly guarded, one may then ascend to the middle elixir field. Having ascended to the middle elixir field, one then ascends to the upper elixir field—this is called the \"three yang.\" The \"flower\" is another name for the three yang. This is the movement of primordial yang, which condenses into five and operates as three. At such a time, the elixir is already formed. Auspicious clouds arise at the crown gate, and the qi of the crown opens, radiant as the sun and moon. The ears hear and the nose smells—not through mere convergence, but through true ascent.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"Reflect on whence the body comes.\"*\n\nFang Wen considers: People of this age do not know why they die. The origin of the body lies in the union of the two halves of the one qi of Heaven and Earth, the qi of father and mother—the very beginning of creation. Knowing that one comes from this, one should cultivate from this, thereby aligning with the root and investigating the origin of creation. If one cultivates from solitary yin alone, it does not accord with the intent. I humbly beg for secret instruction.\n\nAt the inception of human life, there is only the One. The One and speech become two—this is the discourse of the One and the Two. The One and the Two transform each other, giving rise to true water and true fire, and thus spirit and essence are complete. Once true water and true fire are recognized, one can know whence one comes.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"When the sun and moon are out of alignment, success cannot be achieved.\"*\n\nFang Wen examines the *Elixir Scriptures* and finds them entirely based on the celestial images of the sun and moon—these are the true models. By emulating the sun and moon, one can seize the transformative power of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. Yet why does misalignment prevent success? The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* says: *\"The sun and moon interlock, holding the yang banner aloft. Yin bestows yin, and the female transforms into yellow.\"* It also says: *\"The slightest deviation brings regret and harm, becoming a thief to yin.\"* The *Perfected Lord’s Elixir Scripture* states: *\"There is a time to gather, a time to harvest.\"* And the poem by Perfected Master Zhang says: *\"Even a hair’s deviation will not produce the elixir.\"* How, then, does deviation occur? What method ensures no misalignment? This pertains to the firing times. I humbly request the oral transmission.\n\nThe images of the sun and moon originate in spirit and essence. The generation of spirit and essence resides in the One and the Two. The One and the Two are the correct numbers of the firing times. Water and fire have their functions of withdrawal and addition. Thus, one selects the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day—thereby avoiding misalignment. This principle is recorded in the firing times.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"Discern water and fire; unite dragon and tiger; clarify the elixir medicine; comprehend lead and mercury; master withdrawal and addition; revolve the river chariot.\"*\n\nFang Wen has exhaustively studied the *Elixir Scriptures*, which never depart from yin and yang yet generate myriad names—dozens of them, such as water and fire, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, river chariot—all referring to the same thing. Yet here it says: *\"Discern water and fire; unite dragon and tiger; clarify the elixir medicine; comprehend lead and mercury; revolve the river chariot.\"* Why? To recognize water and fire is to recognize dragon and tiger. To recognize dragon and tiger is to recognize lead and mercury—these are the materials of the elixir medicine. Why then speak of \"discerning,\" \"uniting,\" \"clarifying,\" \"comprehending,\" and \"revolving\"? As for the numbers of withdrawal and addition, they pertain to the firing times. If one does not recognize the medicinal materials, how can one master withdrawal and addition? I hope for instruction on the essentials, so that these do not conflict, and later learners may easily understand.\n\nWater and fire, dragon and tiger—these are synonymous. Water and fire refer to nature, hence \"discern.\" There is no application yet. Dragon and tiger refer to emotion, hence \"unite\"—there is already application. Lead and mercury refer to their form, so one knows they are the materials of the medicine—thus one can \"comprehend.\" Mastering withdrawal and addition enables one to \"revolve the river chariot.\"\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"By restraining the po with the hun, one knows the arising and setting of the sun and moon.\"*\n\nThe arising and setting of the sun and moon are the Dao of Heaven, the ultimate numbers of yin and yang. The hun and po are the spirits of humans—how can they know these? Yet it says: *\"By restraining the po with the hun, one can then know.\"* Why? This refers to the two kidneys. The right is the Gate of Life, belonging to yang—this is the hun. Yin is on the right, yang on the left, yet here it is on the right—this is the meaning of restraining the po. The qi of the right kidney ascends to the left eye at midnight. The qi of the left kidney arises in the right eye at noon. Thus one knows the arising and setting of the sun and moon. The hours of *zi* and *wu* are the ultimate numbers of the sun and moon’s generative qi.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"When the qi of the heart and kidneys interact, it is called true water and true fire.\"*\n\nThe heart and kidneys are *kan* and *li*, water and fire—everyone possesses them. Yet the *Elixir Scriptures* say there is a time to gather and a time to harvest, not in the heart and kidneys. Zhang Yifu’s *Elixir Scripture* even claims: *\"Falsely identifying the heart and kidneys as *kan* and *li*.\"* Why then does this text speak of true water and true fire?\n\nWhen the heart and kidneys interact, only then can one speak of the true. Without interaction, they cannot become true. For only through interaction can they produce offspring.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The dragon is the heart; the tiger is the kidney.\"* The kidney’s *qi* is easily depleted, while the heart’s fluid is difficult to accumulate. The key lies in knowing the time of their union. The method of gathering and refining involves generating water from fire and fire from water—this is the art of inversion.\n\nThe dragon and tiger are but alternate names for water and fire. It is also said: *\"The dragon is wood; the tiger is metal.\"* If they belong to metal and wood, why then is the heart called the dragon and the kidney the tiger? Why is the kidney’s *qi* easily depleted, while the heart’s fluid is difficult to accumulate?\n\nThe time of their union is the moment for inner work. When dragon and tiger unite, the *qi* of the sun and moon converge. The *qi* of the heart and kidneys naturally interact at specific times. But what does one gather and refine? From what does one gather? Is the gathered substance visible or invisible? Can it be named or not?\n\nGenerating water from fire and fire from water is indeed an inversion. Yet how, within the human body, can one readily generate water from fire and fire from water? I humbly request detailed instruction. These words and the previous explanations are mutually illuminating.\n\nFire is born of wood, metal is born of water—just as the child follows the father to attain true nature. Yet if fire and water remain uncrossed and unchanged, they cannot be of use. This is the supreme art of generating water from fire and fire from water.\n\nWhen fire is employed, it can readily generate water—this is an oral transmission, not to be conveyed in writing.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The inner elixir’s ingredients arise from the heart and kidneys—everyone possesses them.\"* The numinous embryo is born of true *qi*, just as dragons have pearls and oxen have *huang*. It originates from the yellow sprout, and the inner elixir is thus formed.\n\nYet when Fang Wen consulted the *Elixir Scriptures* and the writings of the perfected in the *Ancient Record of Cultivation*, he found that the so-called ingredients do not lie between the heart and kidneys. If they did, everyone could form a numinous embryo. Solitary *yin* and orphaned *yang* cannot complete transformation. By what means does the dragon possess a pearl? Through what cultivation does the ox acquire *huang*?\n\nWhat is the yellow sprout? Can it be seen? Why is it called the yellow sprout? The yellow sprout is the great elixir’s beginning. Once obtained, one must proceed with the fire phases of refinement before the inner elixir can be completed. By what method does the yellow sprout arise? If the ingredients are not in the heart and kidneys, where then do they return? The heart and kidneys have their own root.\n\nThe dragon does not listen with its ears but with its mouth, excelling in inner vision. The ox can churn its throat, but humans cannot. Thus, the heart and kidneys’ medicine cannot become true.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"Unite dragon and tiger, discern the elixir medicine. Within cinnabar lies mercury; within lead lies silver. When lead and mercury combine, refinement naturally succeeds.\"*\n\nYet if one has not discerned the elixir medicine, how can dragon and tiger unite? Dragon and tiger *are* the elixir medicine. Only by discerning the medicine can one cause dragon and tiger to unite.\n\nWithin cinnabar lies mercury; within lead lies silver—this is the elixir medicine, though it is not ordinary mercury. The Scripture says: *\"Ordinary mercury and common lead are not worth manipulating.\"* This is precisely the reason.\n\nWarm refinement refers to the fire phases. But how does one apply the fire phases? The texts do not explain—only mentioning refinement. How then does one apply the fire?\n\nThis is the matter of fire phases, which relates to the earlier discussion of the *hun* restraining the *po*. To know how the *hun* restrains the *po* is to perceive the fire phases. The fire phases can be measured in hours instead of months, in moments instead of days, and do not require years of gathering.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The method of withdrawing and adding lead and mercury must grasp the mechanism of heaven and earth.\"* Generally, withdrawal and addition occur only after the medicine is in the crucible. Withdrawal and addition refer to the fire phases. Grasping the mechanism of heaven and earth means aligning with the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\n\nThe Scripture says: *\"Though a thousand texts and ten thousand discourses expound the truth, none commit the fire phases to writing. To know the oral transmission that unlocks the mystery, one must discuss it in detail with the immortals.\"*\n\nSince ancient times, the fire phases have not been transmitted in writing. I humbly beseech a dream revelation or direct instruction from the perfected. Though Fang Wen has some understanding, he fears losing the truth. When it comes to practice, discrepancies may arise. Fortunate to have encountered this teaching today, I earnestly implore correction of my learning. I would be most grateful.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: The fire phases in the *Jiefa* must be transmitted in person. I have observed that the true master, in former days at Yuzhang, composed poems in harmony with the immortals, saying:\n\n*\"At the blade’s tip, two horns—\nwhen it flies, the golden elixir falls.\nWait for the mid-autumn eighth month,\nand remember this well.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"At the blade’s tip, two horns—\nthe golden elixir is born above.\nIt forms only at the summit.\"*\n\nThese all refer to the highest-grade great elixir. Though Fang Wen has some understanding, he does not know if it is correct. I beg the true master to instruct me in the cultivation methods of former days.\n\nI have observed the true master performing the \"three-five flying steps\"—is this not the hidden scripture? Does the Supreme Emperor of the Grand Tenuity govern the Celestial Flower, guarding the extended term and preserving the primordial assistant?\n\nI have witnessed this practice and humbly request your annotation.\n\nI have also learned that the true master possesses the divine formula of the \"lower meaning\"—is this not the oral essentials of Lord Lao, the matters of the Six Ding and Jade Maidens? I respectfully seek your annotation.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: This is the *Jiefa* of elixir cultivation. Later generations, relying on their cleverness, fabricate false and misleading teachings, leading later students astray and preventing them from achieving success.\n\nThey do not understand that \"the blade’s tip\" refers to gold within water, and \"two horns\" to wood within fire. Only by wood entering fire can water boil. \"The mid-autumn eighth month\" refers to the number fifteen.\n\nFifteen is the number of the *Hetu*. The eighth month corresponds to metal. The theory of \"drawing the spleen\" does not directly refer to the fifteenth day of the eighth month. The \"three-five flying steps\" do not speak of three-six or four-five, but of three-five—the Star of the Perfected. The Star of the Perfected means emptying the self to employ it, preserving the body as a Perfected One, and guarding the completion of the three-threes. The Star of the Perfected is the third star. Only by preserving the Perfected can one attain transformation—this is not the oral essentials of Lord Lao or the matters of the Six Ding and Jade Maidens.\n\nAs for \"Ding Yi\": This refers to one person. The art of the golden elixir is commonly spoken of as not bearing the surname Ding and given name Yi; the name is concealed as Ding Yi. Ding is fire; Yi is also fire. This is fire within fire, true fire conjoined with common fire—this is the proper method of fire timing. It has never been transmitted to others; it should be separately demonstrated.\n\nFang Wen has observed that the true master has revived the teachings of the *Lingbao* and *Jingming* traditions. The wondrous Dao of *Lingbao* lies within the *Scripture of Salvation*, which contains many teachings. Fang Wen has delved into one or two of its mysteries and humbly hopes the true master will expound the *Scripture of Salvation* in full, establishing it as the foundation of the teachings. The practice of talismanic methods depends on accumulating merit through repeated acts.\n\nFang Wen has also observed that the *Scripture of Reviving the Dead* by the Nine Elder Sovereigns originates from the *Authentic Scripture of Salvation* and belongs to the *Lingbao* tradition. He respectfully requests the true master to bestow the authentic text to instruct those at the altar.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: The *Scripture of Salvation* was first transmitted by the Most High to the Lord of the Dao, who then passed it to me. I have not fully grasped its wonders, so the Lord of the Dao directly pointed to the *Jingming* teachings as the throat and collar of salvation. Like its fundamental principles, it is supremely wondrous—practice it diligently, for mastery does not lie in extensive reading. As the saying goes: \"One strike opens the three gates, straight out onto the nine thoroughfares.\" Do you understand?\n\nIt is also called the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, and the Three-Nines—these are its essential mysteries, which you may not yet know. What is the Three-Nines? It is the number twelve. Setting aside three to make nine yields the Nine Cauldrons; preserving three as three yields the Three Passes. This is precisely the method of the Three Ones. One generates three, two generates four—this is the function of metal and wood.\n\nFormerly, the *Scripture of Reviving the Dead* was the art of the teachings for salvation, but now the authentic text is corrupted beyond recognition. Those who take liberties with it have altered it, so the *Qi Mirror* has led many astray. Recently, the *Chronicle of the Elixir Well* was composed, though its timing remains undetermined. This scripture will require several more days to complete before it can be transmitted.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits:\n*\"The crimson elixir forms in a single day—*\n*This ancient immortal’s words are worth heeding.*\n*Those who speak of nine years or three*\n*Are merely delaying the appointed time.\"*\n\nIt is also said: \"All comes in a moment’s effort, eternally securing boundless ease.\" How can any Dao be so swift? It is also said: \"Mercury is cast into lead, lead into mercury, and transformation is achieved—all in a moment.\" Further: \"True lead is the gold within mercury.\" An ancient immortal’s poem states: *\"The world does not recognize the gold within water.\"* And: *\"Those who recognize it are true immortals.\"* Thus, a single speck of true gold makes one an immortal.\n\nMaster Lü’s poem says:\n*\"Seize the essence of metal to establish the foundation of life.*\n*You must refine true lead with Jia and Geng,*\n*Fire draws the crimson phoenix marrow from the south,*\n*Water seeks the black turtle essence from the northern sea.\"*\n\nHere we see that water and fire are indeed water and fire, residing in the heart and kidneys. True lead is indeed true lead, not the water and fire of the heart and kidneys. Refining this true lead is the great Dao. I hope the true master, in compassion, will not conceal it but clearly and secretly reveal it.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: Within a single day, one may absorb the *huangsu* qi, which is eighty-one breaths. What is eighty-one? It is the total qi of nine nines of *huangsu*. To know and obtain the clear from the turbid, one must refine the turbid to leave the clear—no other task is required, and it can be accomplished in an instant.\n\nFurther: Mercury cast into lead, lead into mercury—this is the method of transformation. The heart joins the kidneys, the kidneys join the heart, and the two qi mutually conjoin. It does not depart from the one or two metals—lead’s child. Know the mother, recognize the child.\n\nThis is the qi of the left kidney ascending to the liver, reaching the lungs, and entering the crown, then returning to the center. As the saying goes: \"Above and below, fivefold division—all qi ascends to the Mysterious.\" From this, one may know that the gold of true lead is the meaning of Jia and Geng.\n\nFang Wen received the Five Thunder Divine Method from the true master, who encountered it at Huayue in the Jade Cave, transmitted by Perfected Lord Wang Ling’an. Now, only the five talismanic scripts remain; the rest—rituals for the four directions, the Red Goose talismans, and other essential methods—are incomplete. I fear they may not be authentic and humbly request the true master to bestow them in full.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: It does not compare to the present Orthodox Unity Five Thunder Method, which merely wastes effort. The Five Thunder method overseen by the supervising Perfected master is the essential one.\n\nSince the *guiyou* year, when Fang Wen was twenty, he met a Daoist from western Shu named Li, who spoke of mercury and sought its method of extraction. In the *gengzi* year, he encountered a Daoist from the Eastern Capital named Chen, who transmitted to Fang Wen the scriptures on the elixir, lead, and mercury. In the *guimao* year, he met Master Wang from Hehuo and Lay Daoist Shu from the capital, and paid respects to Scholar Wang of his hometown to discuss the furnace and cauldron of lead and mercury, as well as fire timing. Last year, while serving in Chongren, he met a senior disciple of Master Wang of Jiangzhou, who transmitted the fire elixir method in great detail. He has already memorialized the Most High, formed a bond with fellow elixir practitioners, and discussed fire timing in detail. However, fire timing is not established in writing but preserved only in oral transmission.\n\nNow, I humbly report to the True Master to discern the right from the wrong with precision, that Fang Wen may proceed without doubt. I intend to commence the work in the *gengxu* year to accomplish the Great Medicine. I reverently beseech the True Master’s guidance and instruction.\n\nFang Wen now silently inquires about the matter of fire timing and begs for a detailed response.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits:\nWithout entering the gate, one wanders many errant paths. The matter is not extraordinary, yet I dare not speak of it in full. Take, for instance, the method of gathering ingredients—one must ask: *What medicine is to be gathered? Is it visible or invisible? Audible or inaudible?* Whether it requires perception or not, the key lies in but one or two points.\n\nAs for the method of fire timing, it concerns the fire timing of the celestial cycle. The secret of refining form alone is insufficient to complete the Golden Elixir. To accomplish the Elixir, one must distinguish the fire timing within the Elixir itself, and the technique of beginning also exists. To know the affairs of the heart, one must seek them in the kidneys. Within the kidneys resides the true fire, and the lead cauldron gives birth to golden liquid.\n\nWhat is meant by the lead cauldron giving birth to golden liquid? Wood gives birth to fire, metal gives birth to water. Water and fire are the functions of husband and wife; metal and wood, the functions of father and son. Only with father and son can there be a household. What is a household? It is the Elixir within the spleen.\n\nYet to seek husband and wife, they must be able to overcome one another. Without overcoming, there can be no governance; without governance, there can be no generation. To know this technique, it lies in but one or two points. Reflect deeply upon this one or two. Let us first discuss this single aspect—if there remains any obscurity, do not hesitate to clarify.\n\nFang Wen respectfully inquires on the following points:\n1. In the sword technique, what is the day when metal and wood overcome one another? Thereafter, should one meditate upon it daily? If so, at what time? Or is there no fixed time?\n\nShould one meditate only on metal-and-fire days, how is it done at night?\n\n1. On metal-and-water mutual-generation days, one begins forging. Must this forging be performed daily, or is there no fixed time? How is it done at night?\n\n2. How does one nurture it for a full year?\n\n3. How does one polish the sword?\n\n4. On the day when metal and water mutually generate, what is the method?\n\n5. The oral instructions at the end of the formula are transmitted heart-to-heart. Mutual overcoming and mutual generation refer to the days when the heavenly stems and earthly branches interact. \"Heart-transmission\" denotes the concealed formula. Its application follows the master’s guidance—it is a secret technique.\n\nFang Wen practices the Eight Hidden Arts of the Dao of Refined Essence within the Cinnabar Landscape, wherein the true name of the Jade Emperor Dao Lord and his concealed names differ, and the celestial seal-script remains unrecognized. He now inquires as follows:\n\n1. The true names of the Jade Emperor in the Eight Palaces:\n   - Gen Palace: Great Vessel\n   - Zhen Palace: Dark and Remote (or Dark and Vast)\n   - Xun Palace: Without Heroism\n   - Li Palace: Earl of History\n   - Kun Palace: Revolving Pearl\n   - Dui Palace: Two Principles (or Two Radiances)\n   - Qian Palace: Primordial Assistant\n   - Kan Palace: Yin Essence\n\n2. The Purple Clarity Emperor Lord:\n   - Pronounced *Ming*\n   - Pronounced *Ting*\n   - Pronounced *Ling*\n\nThough the actual names differ, the Eight Palaces all conceal the true names of the Jade Emperor of the Northern Dipper. Each is employed according to its position, just as metal in stone is ore, while in smelting it becomes elixir.\n\nFang Wen further asks: Is there a swift method to summon the Jade Maidens? The names of the Six Ding Jade Maidens and their talismans vary greatly—he seeks instruction.\n\nThe method of the Jade Maidens originates from a single source, yet sincerity makes them readily responsive. Among contemporary practices free of error, none surpasses *The White Ape Classic*.\n\nHere ends the secret commentary on the *Yellow Plain Writ of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity*.",

      "translated_text": "*The Secret Essentials of the Yellow Plain Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity: An Exegesis*\n\n**Title:** *The Secret Essentials of the Yellow Plain Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity: An Exegesis*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Section of Mysteries (*Dongxuan Bu*), Category of Methods\n\n---\n\nDisciple Fang Wen, bowing reverently to the Perfected Master, ventures to inquire about several matters in the *Yellow Plain Scripture*, humbly beseeching the Jade Decree to reveal the root and origin with luminous instruction.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The five qi ascend to the Origin; the three yang gather at the crown.\"*\n\nFang Wen observes that the Perfected Immortal Zhongli and the Perfected Immortal Lü, in their *Anthology on the Transmission of the Dao*, speak of refining the great elixir of golden cinnabar, saying: *\"The five qi ascend to the Origin; the three flowers gather at the crown.\"* The five qi are inseparable from the five phases—or, it is said, the five viscera. Here it is called the \"three yang,\" while there it is called the \"three flowers.\" Yang is also qi. Moreover, all yang in the human body gathers at the head, and the qi of the five viscera naturally ascends to the Mud Pill Palace. Thus, the eyes can see, the ears can hear, the nose can smell, and the tongue can taste. Yet in the refinement of the golden elixir, it is said: *\"The five qi ascend to the Origin; the three flowers gather at the crown.\"* I fear there may be a distinct transformation at work. I humbly beg for clear instruction.\n\nThe five qi are the qi of the five viscera, which converge and ascend to the Origin Palace. The Origin Palace refers to the lower elixir field. When the lower elixir field is firmly guarded, one may then ascend to the middle elixir field. Having ascended to the middle elixir field, one then ascends to the upper elixir field—this is called the \"three yang.\" The \"flower\" is another name for the three yang. This is the movement of primordial yang, which condenses into five and operates as three. At such a time, the elixir is already formed. Auspicious clouds arise at the crown gate, and the qi of the crown opens, radiant as the sun and moon. The ears hear and the nose smells—not through mere convergence, but through true ascent.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"Reflect on whence the body comes.\"*\n\nFang Wen considers: People of this age do not know why they die. The origin of the body lies in the union of the two halves of the one qi of Heaven and Earth, the qi of father and mother—the very beginning of creation. Knowing that one comes from this, one should cultivate from this, thereby aligning with the root and investigating the origin of creation. If one cultivates from solitary yin alone, it does not accord with the intent. I humbly beg for secret instruction.\n\nAt the inception of human life, there is only the One. The One and speech become two—this is the discourse of the One and the Two. The One and the Two transform each other, giving rise to true water and true fire, and thus spirit and essence are complete. Once true water and true fire are recognized, one can know whence one comes.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"When the sun and moon are out of alignment, success cannot be achieved.\"*\n\nFang Wen examines the *Elixir Scriptures* and finds them entirely based on the celestial images of the sun and moon—these are the true models. By emulating the sun and moon, one can seize the transformative power of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. Yet why does misalignment prevent success? The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* says: *\"The sun and moon interlock, holding the yang banner aloft. Yin bestows yin, and the female transforms into yellow.\"* It also says: *\"The slightest deviation brings regret and harm, becoming a thief to yin.\"* The *Perfected Lord’s Elixir Scripture* states: *\"There is a time to gather, a time to harvest.\"* And the poem by Perfected Master Zhang says: *\"Even a hair’s deviation will not produce the elixir.\"* How, then, does deviation occur? What method ensures no misalignment? This pertains to the firing times. I humbly request the oral transmission.\n\nThe images of the sun and moon originate in spirit and essence. The generation of spirit and essence resides in the One and the Two. The One and the Two are the correct numbers of the firing times. Water and fire have their functions of withdrawal and addition. Thus, one selects the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day—thereby avoiding misalignment. This principle is recorded in the firing times.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"Discern water and fire; unite dragon and tiger; clarify the elixir medicine; comprehend lead and mercury; master withdrawal and addition; revolve the river chariot.\"*\n\nFang Wen has exhaustively studied the *Elixir Scriptures*, which never depart from yin and yang yet generate myriad names—dozens of them, such as water and fire, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, river chariot—all referring to the same thing. Yet here it says: *\"Discern water and fire; unite dragon and tiger; clarify the elixir medicine; comprehend lead and mercury; revolve the river chariot.\"* Why? To recognize water and fire is to recognize dragon and tiger. To recognize dragon and tiger is to recognize lead and mercury—these are the materials of the elixir medicine. Why then speak of \"discerning,\" \"uniting,\" \"clarifying,\" \"comprehending,\" and \"revolving\"? As for the numbers of withdrawal and addition, they pertain to the firing times. If one does not recognize the medicinal materials, how can one master withdrawal and addition? I hope for instruction on the essentials, so that these do not conflict, and later learners may easily understand.\n\nWater and fire, dragon and tiger—these are synonymous. Water and fire refer to nature, hence \"discern.\" There is no application yet. Dragon and tiger refer to emotion, hence \"unite\"—there is already application. Lead and mercury refer to their form, so one knows they are the materials of the medicine—thus one can \"comprehend.\" Mastering withdrawal and addition enables one to \"revolve the river chariot.\"\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"By restraining the po with the hun, one knows the arising and setting of the sun and moon.\"*\n\nThe arising and setting of the sun and moon are the Dao of Heaven, the ultimate numbers of yin and yang. The hun and po are the spirits of humans—how can they know these? Yet it says: *\"By restraining the po with the hun, one can then know.\"* Why? This refers to the two kidneys. The right is the Gate of Life, belonging to yang—this is the hun. Yin is on the right, yang on the left, yet here it is on the right—this is the meaning of restraining the po. The qi of the right kidney ascends to the left eye at midnight. The qi of the left kidney arises in the right eye at noon. Thus one knows the arising and setting of the sun and moon. The hours of *zi* and *wu* are the ultimate numbers of the sun and moon’s generative qi.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"When the qi of the heart and kidneys interact, it is called true water and true fire.\"*\n\nThe heart and kidneys are *kan* and *li*, water and fire—everyone possesses them. Yet the *Elixir Scriptures* say there is a time to gather and a time to harvest, not in the heart and kidneys. Zhang Yifu’s *Elixir Scripture* even claims: *\"Falsely identifying the heart and kidneys as *kan* and *li*.\"* Why then does this text speak of true water and true fire?",

      "translated_text": "When the heart and kidneys interact, only then can one speak of the true. Without interaction, they cannot become true. For only through interaction can they produce offspring.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The dragon is the heart; the tiger is the kidney.\"* The kidney’s *qi* is easily depleted, while the heart’s fluid is difficult to accumulate. The key lies in knowing the time of their union. The method of gathering and refining involves generating water from fire and fire from water—this is the art of inversion.\n\nThe dragon and tiger are but alternate names for water and fire. It is also said: *\"The dragon is wood; the tiger is metal.\"* If they belong to metal and wood, why then is the heart called the dragon and the kidney the tiger? Why is the kidney’s *qi* easily depleted, while the heart’s fluid is difficult to accumulate?\n\nThe time of their union is the moment for inner work. When dragon and tiger unite, the *qi* of the sun and moon converge. The *qi* of the heart and kidneys naturally interact at specific times. But what does one gather and refine? From what does one gather? Is the gathered substance visible or invisible? Can it be named or not?\n\nGenerating water from fire and fire from water is indeed an inversion. Yet how, within the human body, can one readily generate water from fire and fire from water? I humbly request detailed instruction. These words and the previous explanations are mutually illuminating.\n\nFire is born of wood, metal is born of water—just as the child follows the father to attain true nature. Yet if fire and water remain uncrossed and unchanged, they cannot be of use. This is the supreme art of generating water from fire and fire from water.\n\nWhen fire is employed, it can readily generate water—this is an oral transmission, not to be conveyed in writing.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The inner elixir’s ingredients arise from the heart and kidneys—everyone possesses them.\"* The numinous embryo is born of true *qi*, just as dragons have pearls and oxen have *huang*. It originates from the yellow sprout, and the inner elixir is thus formed.\n\nYet when Fang Wen consulted the *Elixir Scriptures* and the writings of the perfected in the *Ancient Record of Cultivation*, he found that the so-called ingredients do not lie between the heart and kidneys. If they did, everyone could form a numinous embryo. Solitary *yin* and orphaned *yang* cannot complete transformation. By what means does the dragon possess a pearl? Through what cultivation does the ox acquire *huang*?\n\nWhat is the yellow sprout? Can it be seen? Why is it called the yellow sprout? The yellow sprout is the great elixir’s beginning. Once obtained, one must proceed with the fire phases of refinement before the inner elixir can be completed. By what method does the yellow sprout arise? If the ingredients are not in the heart and kidneys, where then do they return? The heart and kidneys have their own root.\n\nThe dragon does not listen with its ears but with its mouth, excelling in inner vision. The ox can churn its throat, but humans cannot. Thus, the heart and kidneys’ medicine cannot become true.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"Unite dragon and tiger, discern the elixir medicine. Within cinnabar lies mercury; within lead lies silver. When lead and mercury combine, refinement naturally succeeds.\"*\n\nYet if one has not discerned the elixir medicine, how can dragon and tiger unite? Dragon and tiger *are* the elixir medicine. Only by discerning the medicine can one cause dragon and tiger to unite.\n\nWithin cinnabar lies mercury; within lead lies silver—this is the elixir medicine, though it is not ordinary mercury. The Scripture says: *\"Ordinary mercury and common lead are not worth manipulating.\"* This is precisely the reason.\n\nWarm refinement refers to the fire phases. But how does one apply the fire phases? The texts do not explain—only mentioning refinement. How then does one apply the fire?\n\nThis is the matter of fire phases, which relates to the earlier discussion of the *hun* restraining the *po*. To know how the *hun* restrains the *po* is to perceive the fire phases. The fire phases can be measured in hours instead of months, in moments instead of days, and do not require years of gathering.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"The method of withdrawing and adding lead and mercury must grasp the mechanism of heaven and earth.\"* Generally, withdrawal and addition occur only after the medicine is in the crucible. Withdrawal and addition refer to the fire phases. Grasping the mechanism of heaven and earth means aligning with the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\n\nThe Scripture says: *\"Though a thousand texts and ten thousand discourses expound the truth, none commit the fire phases to writing. To know the oral transmission that unlocks the mystery, one must discuss it in detail with the immortals.\"*\n\nSince ancient times, the fire phases have not been transmitted in writing. I humbly beseech a dream revelation or direct instruction from the perfected. Though Fang Wen has some understanding, he fears losing the truth. When it comes to practice, discrepancies may arise. Fortunate to have encountered this teaching today, I earnestly implore correction of my learning. I would be most grateful.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: The fire phases in the *Jiefa* must be transmitted in person. I have observed that the true master, in former days at Yuzhang, composed poems in harmony with the immortals, saying:\n\n*\"At the blade’s tip, two horns—\nwhen it flies, the golden elixir falls.\nWait for the mid-autumn eighth month,\nand remember this well.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"At the blade’s tip, two horns—\nthe golden elixir is born above.\nIt forms only at the summit.\"*\n\nThese all refer to the highest-grade great elixir. Though Fang Wen has some understanding, he does not know if it is correct. I beg the true master to instruct me in the cultivation methods of former days.\n\nI have observed the true master performing the \"three-five flying steps\"—is this not the hidden scripture? Does the Supreme Emperor of the Grand Tenuity govern the Celestial Flower, guarding the extended term and preserving the primordial assistant?\n\nI have witnessed this practice and humbly request your annotation.\n\nI have also learned that the true master possesses the divine formula of the \"lower meaning\"—is this not the oral essentials of Lord Lao, the matters of the Six Ding and Jade Maidens? I respectfully seek your annotation.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: This is the *Jiefa* of elixir cultivation. Later generations, relying on their cleverness, fabricate false and misleading teachings, leading later students astray and preventing them from achieving success.\n\nThey do not understand that \"the blade’s tip\" refers to gold within water, and \"two horns\" to wood within fire. Only by wood entering fire can water boil. \"The mid-autumn eighth month\" refers to the number fifteen.",

      "translated_text": "Fifteen is the number of the *Hetu*. The eighth month corresponds to metal. The theory of \"drawing the spleen\" does not directly refer to the fifteenth day of the eighth month. The \"three-five flying steps\" do not speak of three-six or four-five, but of three-five—the Star of the Perfected. The Star of the Perfected means emptying the self to employ it, preserving the body as a Perfected One, and guarding the completion of the three-threes. The Star of the Perfected is the third star. Only by preserving the Perfected can one attain transformation—this is not the oral essentials of Lord Lao or the matters of the Six Ding and Jade Maidens.\n\nAs for \"Ding Yi\": This refers to one person. The art of the golden elixir is commonly spoken of as not bearing the surname Ding and given name Yi; the name is concealed as Ding Yi. Ding is fire; Yi is also fire. This is fire within fire, true fire conjoined with common fire—this is the proper method of fire timing. It has never been transmitted to others; it should be separately demonstrated.\n\nFang Wen has observed that the true master has revived the teachings of the *Lingbao* and *Jingming* traditions. The wondrous Dao of *Lingbao* lies within the *Scripture of Salvation*, which contains many teachings. Fang Wen has delved into one or two of its mysteries and humbly hopes the true master will expound the *Scripture of Salvation* in full, establishing it as the foundation of the teachings. The practice of talismanic methods depends on accumulating merit through repeated acts.\n\nFang Wen has also observed that the *Scripture of Reviving the Dead* by the Nine Elder Sovereigns originates from the *Authentic Scripture of Salvation* and belongs to the *Lingbao* tradition. He respectfully requests the true master to bestow the authentic text to instruct those at the altar.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: The *Scripture of Salvation* was first transmitted by the Most High to the Lord of the Dao, who then passed it to me. I have not fully grasped its wonders, so the Lord of the Dao directly pointed to the *Jingming* teachings as the throat and collar of salvation. Like its fundamental principles, it is supremely wondrous—practice it diligently, for mastery does not lie in extensive reading. As the saying goes: \"One strike opens the three gates, straight out onto the nine thoroughfares.\" Do you understand?\n\nIt is also called the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, and the Three-Nines—these are its essential mysteries, which you may not yet know. What is the Three-Nines? It is the number twelve. Setting aside three to make nine yields the Nine Cauldrons; preserving three as three yields the Three Passes. This is precisely the method of the Three Ones. One generates three, two generates four—this is the function of metal and wood.\n\nFormerly, the *Scripture of Reviving the Dead* was the art of the teachings for salvation, but now the authentic text is corrupted beyond recognition. Those who take liberties with it have altered it, so the *Qi Mirror* has led many astray. Recently, the *Chronicle of the Elixir Well* was composed, though its timing remains undetermined. This scripture will require several more days to complete before it can be transmitted.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits:\n*\"The crimson elixir forms in a single day—*\n*This ancient immortal’s words are worth heeding.*\n*Those who speak of nine years or three*\n*Are merely delaying the appointed time.\"*\n\nIt is also said: \"All comes in a moment’s effort, eternally securing boundless ease.\" How can any Dao be so swift? It is also said: \"Mercury is cast into lead, lead into mercury, and transformation is achieved—all in a moment.\" Further: \"True lead is the gold within mercury.\" An ancient immortal’s poem states: *\"The world does not recognize the gold within water.\"* And: *\"Those who recognize it are true immortals.\"* Thus, a single speck of true gold makes one an immortal.\n\nMaster Lü’s poem says:\n*\"Seize the essence of metal to establish the foundation of life.*\n*You must refine true lead with Jia and Geng,*\n*Fire draws the crimson phoenix marrow from the south,*\n*Water seeks the black turtle essence from the northern sea.\"*\n\nHere we see that water and fire are indeed water and fire, residing in the heart and kidneys. True lead is indeed true lead, not the water and fire of the heart and kidneys. Refining this true lead is the great Dao. I hope the true master, in compassion, will not conceal it but clearly and secretly reveal it.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: Within a single day, one may absorb the *huangsu* qi, which is eighty-one breaths. What is eighty-one? It is the total qi of nine nines of *huangsu*. To know and obtain the clear from the turbid, one must refine the turbid to leave the clear—no other task is required, and it can be accomplished in an instant.\n\nFurther: Mercury cast into lead, lead into mercury—this is the method of transformation. The heart joins the kidneys, the kidneys join the heart, and the two qi mutually conjoin. It does not depart from the one or two metals—lead’s child. Know the mother, recognize the child.\n\nThis is the qi of the left kidney ascending to the liver, reaching the lungs, and entering the crown, then returning to the center. As the saying goes: \"Above and below, fivefold division—all qi ascends to the Mysterious.\" From this, one may know that the gold of true lead is the meaning of Jia and Geng.\n\nFang Wen received the Five Thunder Divine Method from the true master, who encountered it at Huayue in the Jade Cave, transmitted by Perfected Lord Wang Ling’an. Now, only the five talismanic scripts remain; the rest—rituals for the four directions, the Red Goose talismans, and other essential methods—are incomplete. I fear they may not be authentic and humbly request the true master to bestow them in full.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits: It does not compare to the present Orthodox Unity Five Thunder Method, which merely wastes effort. The Five Thunder method overseen by the supervising Perfected master is the essential one.\n\nSince the *guiyou* year, when Fang Wen was twenty, he met a Daoist from western Shu named Li, who spoke of mercury and sought its method of extraction. In the *gengzi* year, he encountered a Daoist from the Eastern Capital named Chen, who transmitted to Fang Wen the scriptures on the elixir, lead, and mercury. In the *guimao* year, he met Master Wang from Hehuo and Lay Daoist Shu from the capital, and paid respects to Scholar Wang of his hometown to discuss the furnace and cauldron of lead and mercury, as well as fire timing. Last year, while serving in Chongren, he met a senior disciple of Master Wang of Jiangzhou, who transmitted the fire elixir method in great detail. He has already memorialized the Most High, formed a bond with fellow elixir practitioners, and discussed fire timing in detail. However, fire timing is not established in writing but preserved only in oral transmission.",

      "translated_text": "Now, I humbly report to the True Master to discern the right from the wrong with precision, that Fang Wen may proceed without doubt. I intend to commence the work in the *gengxu* year to accomplish the Great Medicine. I reverently beseech the True Master’s guidance and instruction.\n\nFang Wen now silently inquires about the matter of fire timing and begs for a detailed response.\n\nFang Wen respectfully submits:\nWithout entering the gate, one wanders many errant paths. The matter is not extraordinary, yet I dare not speak of it in full. Take, for instance, the method of gathering ingredients—one must ask: *What medicine is to be gathered? Is it visible or invisible? Audible or inaudible?* Whether it requires perception or not, the key lies in but one or two points.\n\nAs for the method of fire timing, it concerns the fire timing of the celestial cycle. The secret of refining form alone is insufficient to complete the Golden Elixir. To accomplish the Elixir, one must distinguish the fire timing within the Elixir itself, and the technique of beginning also exists. To know the affairs of the heart, one must seek them in the kidneys. Within the kidneys resides the true fire, and the lead cauldron gives birth to golden liquid.\n\nWhat is meant by the lead cauldron giving birth to golden liquid? Wood gives birth to fire, metal gives birth to water. Water and fire are the functions of husband and wife; metal and wood, the functions of father and son. Only with father and son can there be a household. What is a household? It is the Elixir within the spleen.\n\nYet to seek husband and wife, they must be able to overcome one another. Without overcoming, there can be no governance; without governance, there can be no generation. To know this technique, it lies in but one or two points. Reflect deeply upon this one or two. Let us first discuss this single aspect—if there remains any obscurity, do not hesitate to clarify.\n\nFang Wen respectfully inquires on the following points:\n1. In the sword technique, what is the day when metal and wood overcome one another? Thereafter, should one meditate upon it daily? If so, at what time? Or is there no fixed time?",

Last year, while serving in Chongren, he met a senior disciple of Master Wang of Jiangzhou, who transmitted the fire elixir method in great detail. He has already memorialized the Most High, formed a bond with fellow elixir practitioners, and discussed fire timing in detail. However, fire timing is not established in writing but preserved only in oral transmission.",

Must this forging be performed daily, or is there no fixed time? How is it done at night?\n\n2. How does one nurture it for a full year?\n\n3. How does one polish the sword?\n\n4. On the day when metal and water mutually generate, what is the method?\n\n5. The oral instructions at the end of the formula are transmitted heart-to-heart. Mutual overcoming and mutual generation refer to the days when the heavenly stems and earthly branches interact. \"Heart-transmission\" denotes the concealed formula. Its application follows the master’s guidance—it is a secret technique.\n\nFang Wen practices the Eight Hidden Arts of the Dao of Refined Essence within the Cinnabar Landscape, wherein the true name of the Jade Emperor Dao Lord and his concealed names differ, and the celestial seal-script remains unrecognized. He now inquires as follows:\n\n1. The true names of the Jade Emperor in the Eight Palaces:\n   - Gen Palace: Great Vessel\n   - Zhen Palace: Dark and Remote (or Dark and Vast)\n   - Xun Palace: Without Heroism\n   - Li Palace: Earl of History\n   - Kun Palace: Revolving Pearl\n   - Dui Palace: Two Principles (or Two Radiances)\n   - Qian Palace: Primordial Assistant\n   - Kan Palace: Yin Essence\n\n2. The Purple Clarity Emperor Lord:\n   - Pronounced *Ming*\n   - Pronounced *Ting*\n   - Pronounced *Ling*\n\nThough the actual names differ, the Eight Palaces all conceal the true names of the Jade Emperor of the Northern Dipper. Each is employed according to its position, just as metal in stone is ore, while in smelting it becomes elixir.\n\nFang Wen further asks: Is there a swift method to summon the Jade Maidens? The names of the Six Ding Jade Maidens and their talismans vary greatly—he seeks instruction.\n\nThe method of the Jade Maidens originates from a single source, yet sincerity makes them readily responsive. Among contemporary practices free of error, none surpasses *The White Ape Classic*.\n\nHere ends the secret commentary on the *Yellow Plain Writ of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity*.",
