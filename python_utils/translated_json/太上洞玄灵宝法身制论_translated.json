  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Treasure Treatise on the Regulation of the Dharmakāya of the Dao**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Numinous Treasure Treatise on the Regulation of the Dharmakāya of the Dao*. One scroll.\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Cavernous Mystery Section, Precepts and Regulations Category.\n\n---\n\nEntering the Dao-nature, forbearance is supreme; ritual is its function, and harmony is its highest value.\nThe method of entering the Dao must shun anger and contention. If one’s voice or countenance is harsh, startling the assembly and disturbing the multitude, or if one clings to folly and obstinacy, gesturing wildly with one’s hands, such conduct harms the *qi* and impedes study. Those who violate this shall forever be barred from the Dharma-seat.\nShould one fail to adhere to the regulations, their register shall be revoked and their ordination stripped.\n\nThe nature of wine corrupts virtue and gives rise to contention and arrogance. Though the precepts are clear and detailed, violators persist.\nAll registered disciples must exercise restraint and caution, and how much more so must scholars of the Dao. How can they not be prohibited?\nThe scriptural prohibitions on wine must be observed. When harmonizing the spirit with medicinal decoctions, moderation must be applied with reason.\nWhen establishing an altar or seating for a fast, or when submitting a petition to invoke response, one must not arrive before the assembly in a state of intoxication, nor secretly commit hidden transgressions, assuming others remain unaware. Violators shall be confined for one hundred days; repeat offenders shall have their register revoked and their ordination stripped.\n\nMalicious speech and slanderous words are forbidden by the enlightened and virtuous. A glib tongue topples nations—this is the profound teaching of the ancient sages.\nIf one reverses black and white, debates gains and losses, recklessly spreads right and wrong, or fabricates baseless slander like embroidered brocade, becoming a nuisance to the assembly, such conduct must be strictly prevented.\nViolators shall be confined for one year according to the regulations; a third offense shall result in the revocation of their register.\n\nLife is the foundation of great virtue; benevolence is the essence of Confucian and Daoist teachings. Compassion is the root of blessings, while killing is the foremost sin. To establish merit and cultivate virtue, nothing surpasses the cessation of harm. Thus, the relief of living beings’ suffering arises from compassion toward all things.\nOf late, male and female scholars of the Dao, during the summer festival of the fifth month, have taken to proclaiming the release of living creatures in advance. Before the appointed day, they have already begun trapping them, gathering them by the riverside, where many perish prematurely. What was intended to accumulate merit instead incurs great sin.\nHenceforth, one must not preemptively declare the release of living beings. If, moved by sudden compassion, one encounters such creatures, they may purchase them and perform a rite of liberation, accompanied by a fast to dedicate the merit. However, the master and host must also be cautioned against treating the matter lightly or acting with disdain, for such negligence becomes the fault of the sponsor.\nViolators shall be confined for two hundred days.\n\nThe solemn observances of fasts and precepts, the regulations for kitchens and blessings, have already been detailed by Master Lu and may be fully implemented.\nSince the virtuous teachings have spread near and far, all should jointly uphold these admonitions.\nIf one transgresses the scriptural regulations by using vessels such as goblets, kneeling mats, or crouching stools under the pretext of ritual, such conduct differs little from frivolous feasting and may be ridiculed by onlookers. All such improprieties must be corrected. One must not fear the disapproval of the multitude but rather uphold the integrity of the regulations.\nViolators shall be confined for one year; a third offense shall result in punishment according to the law and the erasure of their name.\n\nThe vegetables of the five pungent plants and the meat of the six livestock are all forbidden by the precepts. Scholars of the Dao must not partake of them, for they either harm the spirit and damage the nature or render prayers and supplications ineffective.\nWhen seeking healing or deliverance from distress, one should observe these prohibitions oneself and avoid even the appearance of impropriety, lest one be mocked by the discerning and bring ridicule upon the entire community of practitioners.\nViolators shall be confined for one hundred days.\n\nVirtue does not stand alone but requires the support of neighbors and friends. Association and interaction must not be entirely severed.\nMoreover, one who possesses virtue cannot be without conduct, and conduct must follow proper principles.\nIf a household of sincere faith prepares a fast and arranges a kitchen for offerings, their reverent intent is recorded across the Three Realms. How much more should scholars of the Dao be moved to respond? Yet some become preoccupied with feasting and drinking, or are constrained by the pursuit of profit, causing the sponsoring household to harbor resentment. When guests overstay, the spirit wearies and the body tires, giving rise to inner anger. This already provokes the sighs and reproach of the assembly. Upon careful reflection on the unseen principles, how can such conduct be without fault?\nHenceforth, once one’s name has been recorded, if urgent matters arise, one must inform the sponsor in advance and seek a replacement. Yet some, driven by greed for lavish hospitality, compel the sponsor to display displeasure. Such behavior must be strictly prevented.\nViolators shall be confined for two hundred days; a third offense shall result in permanent expulsion from the Dharma-seat.\n\nThe music of *Shaowu* and the refined sounds of the *Ya* and *Song* odes have endured since antiquity, yet they are distant and difficult to revive. Instead, the lewd and seductive lyrics of *Zheng* and *Wei*, the decadent verses, the exotic performances of the Western Qiang, and the drum dances of the Northern Hu have taken their place. These cannot aid in cultivating the nature or delighting the spirit but only serve to confuse the mind.\nIf, during gatherings of the scriptural assemblies, one indulges in such entertainments alongside fellow practitioners, and the drinking exceeds all bounds, leading to vulgar displays that arise unbidden, such conduct disrupts the spirit, harms the body, and damages the Dao while violating virtue.\nViolators shall be confined for one hundred days.\n\n---\n\n**The Eight Articles Above**\n\nThe wondrous Dharma of the Numinous Treasure originates before the Primordial Beginning. Its true essence is emptiness and quiescence, abiding in profound stillness. It manifests when goodness arises and withdraws when conditions are absent. Though its true resonance is subtle and marvelous, pervading without limitation, the wise embody it in the space between being and non-being, while the foolish, seized by doubt, deem it forever extinguished.\n\nThus, gazing upon its scrolls, one cannot call it \"being\"; abiding in its constant stillness, one cannot call it \"non-being.\" From non-being arises being, and from being arises non-being—lucid yet without substance, hence inexhaustible. It is undifferentiated and unconditioned.\n\nThe benevolent attain benevolence; the wise attain wisdom. The foolish, through it, awaken to divine illumination and cultivate wisdom. Thus we know the scriptures arise from principle—who could deny it? To seek them is to let divine wisdom arise through reflection; to abandon them is to plunge the spirit into darkness.\n\nTherefore, the scriptures are the foundation of great awakening, and principle is the dwelling of meaning. In their constant stillness and lofty sublimity, even the worthy and the wise dare not aspire beyond them.\n\n*Here ends the* **Treatise on the Dharma-Body of the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*.*",
