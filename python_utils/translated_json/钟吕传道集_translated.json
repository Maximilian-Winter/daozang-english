  "full_translation": "**The *Zhong Lü Transmission of the Dao* (18 scrolls)**\n*Inscribed by the True Person of Zhengyang, Zhongli Quan, recounting the Pure Yang True Person Lü Dongbin’s (Master Hongjun) teachings, transmitted by the True Person of Huayang, Shi Jianwu (Master Xisheng).*\n*Composed entirely in question-and-answer form.*\n\n**Discourse on True Immortals (First)**\nLü said: *\"When a person is born—secure yet free of illness, vigorous yet free of aging, alive yet free of death—what Dao can achieve this?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"A person’s birth begins when the two *qi* of father and mother converge, their essence and blood forming the embryo. After the Primordial Beginning (*Taichu*), the primordial substance (*taizhi*) takes form. Yin sustains yang’s generation; *qi* follows the embryo’s transformation, and after three hundred days, the form is complete. The luminous spirit enters the body, separating from the mother. From the Primordial Substance onward, the *qi* ascends and descends, nurturing the yellow sprout. At five thousand days, the *qi* is full, its measure reaching eighty-one *zhang*. At fifteen, one is called a ‘boy’—when yin contains half of yang, like the light of the rising sun. Beyond this point, the primordial yang scatters, true *qi* dissipates, and weakness brings illness, aging, death, and extinction. A lifetime of ignorance damages the luminous spirit; a lifetime of folly depletes one’s allotted years. Thus, birth and death differ in rank, and lifespans vary in length. Born, then annihilated; annihilated, then reborn—cycle after cycle, unaware, one falls into other realms, losing one’s true form to alien shells. The root of true nature is lost to humanity, trapped in samsaric revolutions with no escape. Only if one encounters a True Immortal or Perfected Sage can one’s sins be purged, the old skin shed, and a human form regained. Yet even then, lingering in stupidity and illness, one accumulates karmic debts across lifetimes, ascending to blessed lands only to still suffer hunger, cold, and calamity. Through gradual refinement, one may attain a complete form—but remains bound to servitude and lowly stations. Should one repeat past transgressions, like a ball rolling off a board, one returns to samsaric cycles.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Born in the Central Realm, fortunate to live in peace, with food and time not yet scarce—those who love are at ease, those who resent fall ill, the greedy live on, the fearful perish. Today, I kneel before my revered teacher, twice bowing, twice pleading: given that birth and death are paramount, may I humbly beg for instruction on the principles of avoiding illness, aging, and death, and be guided by my teacher?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"To escape samsara, avoid alien forms, and ensure a body free of illness, aging, death, and suffering—standing firm beneath heaven, embracing yin and cradling yang as a true human—this is the path. Among humans, some refine to become immortals; among immortals, some ascend to heaven.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The dead become ghosts; those who attain the Dao become immortals. If immortals are of one rank, why speak of ascending from immortality to heaven?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Immortals are not one. Pure yin without yang is a ghost; pure yang without yin is an immortal; a mix of yin and yang is a human. Only humans can become ghosts or immortals. Youth who do not cultivate, indulging in licentiousness, die and become ghosts. Those who awaken and refine transcend humanity, shedding their form to become immortals. There are five ranks of immortals and three stages of attainment. Cultivation lies with the practitioner, and fulfillment follows one’s capacity.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"You speak of three stages of attainment and five ranks of immortals—why?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"The three stages are lesser, middle, and greater attainment. The five ranks are: ghost-immortals, human-immortals, earth-immortals, spirit-immortals, and heavenly-immortals—all are immortals. Ghost-immortals remain bound to ghosts; human-immortals to humanity; earth-immortals to the earth; spirit-immortals to the spirit realm; heavenly-immortals to heaven.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What are these ‘ghost-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"The lowest of the five immortals. Though they escape the yin realm, their divine forms are unclear, their ghostly essence nameless in the Three Mountains, their names unknown in Penglai. Though they avoid rebirth, they cannot return to the immortal lands. They have no true abode, only the chance to be reborn into another form.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Then these ‘ghost-immortals’—what methods do they practice, what efforts do they expend to attain such a state?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Those who cultivate, at first, do not grasp the Great Dao, yet seek swift attainment. Their bodies are like gnarled wood, their minds like dead ashes, their spirit and consciousness held inward, their resolve unshaken. Within meditation, they emerge with a yin-born spirit—thus a pure and luminous ghost, not a true Daoist immortal. Since their single resolve does not scatter and their yin-essence lingers, they are called ‘ghost-immortals.’ Though called immortals, they are truly ghosts. The ancients and modern adherents of the *Chóngshì* sect, when their efforts reach this point, claim they have attained the Dao—how laughable!\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Then what are these ‘human-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Human-immortals are the second lowest of the five. Cultivators of the True Dao, though they grasp neither the Great Dao nor its methods, fix their resolve and labor tirelessly throughout their lives. The Five *Xíng* qi are wrongly mingled, their forms and essences hardened—thus the Eight *Yī* evils cannot harm them. They live long and suffer little, and so are called ‘human-immortals.’\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Then these ‘human-immortals’—what methods, what efforts lead to such a state?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Those who cultivate, at first, may hear of the Great Dao. Yet their karmic burdens are heavy and their blessings thin; all manner of trials cause them to abandon their original resolve, settling for minor achievements. They claim their methods have merit, yet their resolve never shifts nor their practices change with the seasons. Like those who forsake the Five Flavors, how could they know of the Six *Qì*? Those who forget the Seven Emotions, how could they grasp the Ten *Jiè*? Those who practice *Shùyǎn* spitting, yet take breath in wrongly. Those who wear *Cǎibǔ* patches, yet mock *Qīngjìng* purity as foolishness. Those who greedily seize external *qi* to cheat Heaven and Earth, yet refuse to abstain from food. Those who cling to visualization, yet neglect *Dǎoyǐn* exercises. Alone they sit, breath confined—how could they know of *Zìrán*? They strain their bodies, yet fail to recognize *Wúwéi*. They draw yin-qi from women, differing not from those who shrink the Golden Tortoise. They nourish yang with girl’s milk, differing not from those who refine elixirs. By such analogies, one could enumerate their errors endlessly. Yet all these are still Dao, though they cannot fulfill the Great Dao. They merely achieve minor comforts, longevity, and ease within one method or technique—thus they are called ‘human-immortals.’ And there are many more in the world who, delighting in fleeting gains yet weary of sustained effort, practice carelessly, misjudging times and days, and instead bring on sickness while failing to extend their years.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Then what are these ‘earth-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Earth-immortals are the midpoint between mortal and Daoist, possessing the potential of spirit-immortals. They do not grasp the Great Dao, yet attain minor achievements. Their efforts are unseen, but they linger long in the world, never dying among humanity.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"How does one begin the practice of ‘earth-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"First, one must follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent, and take the numbers of the Sun and Moon’s generation and growth. Within the body, one applies the cycles of years and months; within the day, one applies the moments of time. First, one must recognize the **Dragon** and **Tiger** [1], then align the **Kàn** and **Lí** [2]. One distinguishes the purity and turbidity of water, and divides the **qi** and climate into early and late. One gathers the **Zhēn Yī** [True Unity/essence and breath], observes the **Èr Yī** [Two Principles/yang and yin], arranges the **Sān Cái** [Three Talents/Heaven, Earth, and humanity], divides the **Sì Xiàng** [Four Symbols/Four Celestial Animals], separates the **Wǔ Yùn** [Five Phases], stabilizes the **Liù Qì** [Six Qi], collects the **Qí Bǎo** [Seven Treasures], sequences the **Bā Guà** [Eight Trigrams], and traverses the **Jiǔ Zhōu** [Nine Continents]. When the Five Phases are inverted, the **qi** flows to the **mother phase** while the **liquid essence** circulates between the **father and mother phases** [3]. The **Three Fields** [4] are reversed in repetition, refining into elixirs. One permanently subdues the lower field, refines the form to dwell in the world, and thus attains immortality—this is called ‘earth-immortal.’\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What are these ‘spirit-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Spirit-immortals are those who, having grown weary of earthly residence as earth-immortals, yet persist in their practice without ceasing. When their joints are harmonized, they extract lead and add mercury, refining the **golden essence** to the vertex. The **jade liquid** returns to the elixir field, where the formed **qi** aligns with the Five Qi toward the **primordial source** [5], and the Three Yangs gather at the crown. When their practice is complete, they forget their form, and the **embryonic immortal** transforms naturally. With yin exhausted and yang pure, they attain a body beyond the body. Abandoning their physical substance, they ascend as immortals, transcending the mundane to become **sages**. They reject worldly affairs and return to the **Three Mountains** [6], thus they are called ‘spirit-immortals.’\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What then are these ‘heaven-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Earth-immortals who grow weary of the Three Mountains and instead transmit the Dao to the world—where their practice yields results and their deeds are manifest—when both are fulfilled, they receive the **Heavenly Scripture** and return to the **Cave of Heaven** [7], and this is called ‘heaven-immortal.’ If they then grow weary of the Cave of Heaven and take up official duties as immortal officials, they are called: the lower **Water Official**, the middle **Earth Official**, and the upper **Heaven Official**. Their contributions to Heaven and Earth are vast, and their deeds in the present and past are profound. Ascending through official ranks, they traverse the **Thirty-Six Caves of Heaven** and return to the **Eighty-One Yang Skies** [8], ultimately ascending to the realm of the **Three Pure Ones** [9] in **Natural Emptiness** [10].\"*\n\nLü said: *\"‘Ghost-immortals’ are indeed unattainable, and ‘heaven-immortals’ are beyond my daring to aspire to. May I inquire now: are the methods of ‘human-immortals,’ ‘earth-immortals,’ and ‘spirit-immortals’ accessible in this age?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Human-immortals do not exceed the minor achievements, earth-immortals do not exceed the intermediate achievements, and spirit-immortals do not exceed the great achievements. These three grades are, in essence, one. To seek the Dao through methods, the Dao is not difficult. To seek immortality through the Dao, immortality is also quite easy.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"In ancient and modern times, those who cultivated life have not failed to seek longevity, nor failed to seek ascension as immortals. Yet still, they do not attain longevity or ascension. Why is this?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Their methods do not align with the Dao. Through excessive knowledge and forced comprehension, they generate minor techniques and tangential paths, which do not escape sickness and death—though they may still be called **corpse dissolution** [11]. They deceive the world, promoting one another, and thus lead others astray from the Great Dao. Even those with sincere faith and resolute will, who have practiced diligently for long, ultimately see no results and pass away in their appointed time. Alas!\"*\n\n**《Zhōng Lǚ Chuándào Jí》 – On the Great Dao (Section II)**\n\nLǚ said: *\"What is meant by the **Great Dao**?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The Great Dao is formless, nameless, unquestioned, and unanswered. Its vastness knows no outer limit, its subtlety knows no inner bound. It cannot be known, nor can it be practiced!\"*\n\nLǚ said: *\"In ancient and modern times, those who attained the Dao began by studying it, then by possessing it, then by embodying it, and finally by perfecting it—thus ascending from the mundane world to Penglai, to the Cavernous Heavens, to the Yang Heaven, and ultimately to the Three Pure Ones. Yet today, the Master alone declares that the Dao cannot be known or practiced. But in the Dao, is he not secretly attaining something?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"I have no hidden attainment in the Dao. Truly, all who claim to follow the Dao possess only its name. Though they hear of the Great Dao, they lack faith; though they have faith, they lack resolve. They begin with diligence and end in neglect, sitting and forgetting to rise, standing and forgetting to act. They begin with anxiety and toil, yet conclude in sloth. Because of this, I say the Great Dao is difficult to know and difficult to practice.\"*\n\n「Lǚ asked: *\"How does the principle of the Great Dao being difficult to know and difficult to practice manifest?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"Through minor practices of peripheral schools, one can easily see results, yet people still desire to attain many benefits. They teach one another these methods, yet to their deaths, they fail to awaken. Thus, they become customs, corrupting and undermining the Great Dao. There are those who observe fasts and abstain from grains, those who gather qi, those who rinse and gargle, those who abandon their wives, those who cut off flavors, those who practice meditation and dhyāna, those who remain silent, those who cultivate visualization, those who gather yin, those who ingest breath, those who uphold purity, those who still the mind, those who sever attachments, those who open the crown, those who withdraw into the tortoise shell, those who cut off traces, those who chant scriptures, those who refine through burning, those who regulate breath, those who guide and pull [the body], those who exhale and inhale, those who gather and supplement, those who give alms, those who provide offerings, those who rescue and relieve, those who enter mountains, those who recognize nature, those who remain unmoved, those who uphold teachings—...the minor practices of peripheral schools cannot all be listed.\n\nAs for methods like gathering the radiance of the sun and moon, cultivating the qi of heaven and earth, concentrating thought and intention to form elixir and cinnabar, straining the body to seek transcendence, where one enters more than one exits, and where one may even attack illnesses—these are acceptable for nurturing the true essence. To believe in the prenatal breath, sever all thoughts and forget speech, these are acceptable for nurturing one’s nature. To consider oneself as the *Tài Yī* containing the true qi, achieving the *Jīn Qiāng Bù Dǎo* [immovable golden spear], making the Yellow River flow backward—these are inferior methods for prolonging life.\n\nThe body may wither like dry wood, the mind grow cold as dead ashes, these mere tricks of gathering spirit. Yet why do ancient and modern practitioners of the Dao, who toil and strain with their hearts, so often cling to these petty concerns?\"」\n\nHow can swallowing saliva as medicine bring about transformation?\nHow can gathering *qi* as elixir achieve permanence?\nTo take the liver as the Dragon and the lungs as the Tiger—how can this bring union?\nTo regard *Kàn* as lead and *Lí* as mercury—how can this allow for extraction and supplementation?\nTo water the seasons in hope of sprouting the Yellow Sprout,\nTo focus the mind unscattered in pursuit of the Great Medicine—\nYet misaligning years and months, wasting days and disrupting times,\nUnknowing the roots of the Five Phases—how can one grasp the *Sān Cái*’s transformation?\nTo pluck branches and leaves, only to mislead later generations—\nThus the Dao grows ever more distant, ever more estranged,\nHeterodoxies arise as custom, betraying the Master’s original intent.\nAll from hearsay and oral tradition,\nPassing secrets to the unknowing, teaching by rote,\nFollowing sequences into the underworld—chilling the heart.\nIt is not that one does not wish to expound the Great Dao—\nRather, the world’s sins are heavy, blessings meager,\nThey do not trust Heaven’s workings, value wealth over life,\nAnd willingly become ghosts.\n\nLü said: *“Having known the petty methods and side paths,\nMay I hear of the Great Dao?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“The Dao has no questions, questions have no answers.\nYet when the true essence is once divided, the Primordial Simplicity has already scattered.\nThe Dao generates One, One generates Two, Two generates Three.\nOne is the essence, Two is the function, Three is transformation.\nEssence and function do not depart from yin and yang,\nTransformation arises from their union.\nAbove, middle, and below form the Three *Cái*;\nHeaven, Earth, and Human share in the Dao.\nThe Dao generates the Two *Qì*, *qi* generates the Three *Cái*,\nThe Three *Cái* generate the Five Phases, the Five Phases generate all things.\nAmong all things, the most refined, most noble—is Humanity.\nOnly Humanity exhausts the principles of all things,\nFulfills its own nature.\nTo exhaust principles and fulfill nature is to reach life—\nTo preserve life and safeguard existence is to align with the Dao,\nThus one should match Heaven and Earth in endurance,\nAnd share in their eternal duration.”*\n\nLü said: *“Long-lasting and enduring, spanning millennia without end.\nHuman life is but a hundred years, seventy being rare.\nWhy does the Dao belong uniquely to Heaven and Earth, distant from humanity?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“The Dao is not distant from humanity—humanity distances itself from the Dao.\nThe reason for this distance is ignorance of the methods to nurture life.\nThe reason for ignorance is not recognizing the proper timing of effort.\nThe reason for failing to recognize timing is not comprehending Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms.”*\n\n**Discussion on Heaven and Earth (Section Three)**\n\nLü said: *“What of Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms—may they be heard?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms are the Dao’s great operation, whereby yin and yang ascend and descend without ceasing, upholding and sustaining themselves to attain enduring firmness. They have never lightly revealed themselves to humankind.”*\n\nLü said: *“How does Heaven and Earth’s adherence to the Dao manifest as a sustaining mechanism? How does this operation begin? How does its efficacy become apparent?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“Once the great Dao manifests as form, it gives rise to numbers. Heaven obtains the *Qián* Dao, taking *one* as its essence—light and pure, dwelling above—its function being *yang*. Earth obtains the *Kūn* Dao, taking *two* as its essence—heavy and turbid, dwelling below—its function being *yin*. As *yang* ascends and *yin* descends, they mutually intermingle. The operations of *Qián* and *Kūn* never stray from the Dao, and their beginnings have their season, their efficacy its appointed day.”*\n\nLü said: *“Heaven, obtaining the *Qián* Dao, functions through *yang*—*yang* governs ascent, so how does it interact with Earth? Earth, obtaining the *Kūn* Dao, functions through *yin*—*yin* governs descent, so how does it interact with Heaven? If Heaven and Earth do not interact, how can *yin* and *yang* unite? If *yin* and *yang* do not unite, how can *Qián* and *Kūn* operate? If *Qián* and *Kūn* have no operation, though there be beginnings and days of efficacy, how can the great Dao be attained?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“Heaven’s Dao takes *Qián* as its essence, *yang* as its function, and accumulates *qi* above. Earth’s Dao takes *Kūn* as its essence, *yin* as its function, and accumulates water below. Heaven, in its Dao, uses *Qián* to probe *Kūn*. The first probing yields the eldest son—*Zhèn*. The second probing yields the middle son—*Kàn*. The third probing yields the youngest son—*Gèn*. Thus, Heaven interacts with Earth, using the *Qián* Dao to probe the *Kūn* Dao and generate the three *yang*s.\n\nWhen Earth, in its Dao, uses *Kūn* to probe *Qián*, the first probing yields the eldest daughter—*Xùn*. The second probing yields the middle daughter—*Lí*. The third probing yields the youngest daughter—*Duì*. Thus, Earth interacts with Heaven, using the *Kūn* Dao to probe the *Qián* Dao and generate the three *yin*s. The three *yang*s unite with the three *yin*s, and all things are born. The three *yin*s unite with the three *yang*s, and all things are completed. Heaven and Earth’s union originates from *Qián* and *Kūn* probing each other and moving within the Dao. *Qián* and *Kūn* probing each other generate the six *qi*; the six *qi* intermingling differentiate the five phases; the five phases intermingling give rise to all things.\n\nWhen the *Qián* Dao descends, the three probings completed, the *yang* ascends anew—*yang* within concealing *yin*, returning to Heaven. When the *Kūn* Dao ascends, the three probings completed, the *yin* descends anew—*yin* within concealing *yang*, returning to Earth. *Yang* concealing *yin*, the *yin* does not dissipate—this is called *true yin*. *True yin* reaches Heaven, born through *yang*, hence *yin* descends from Heaven—how could *yin* within lack *yang*? *Yin* concealing *yang*, the *yang* does not perish—this is called *true yang*. *True yang* reaches Earth, born through *yin*, hence *yang* ascends from Earth—how could *yang* within lack *yin*? *Yang* concealing *yin* returns to Earth; *yin* concealing *yang* returns to Heaven. Thus, it cycles endlessly without cessation. Their union never strays from the Dao—that is how they attain enduring firmness.”*\n\nLü said: *“Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms, moving within the Dao to attain enduring firmness, are the operations of Heaven and Earth. Yet humanity, though endowed with wisdom, attends to purity of mind. Seeking to practice the great Dao—whether to secure minor comfort and longevity, moderate immortality, or supreme transcendence—how should one operate and move within the Dao, activating Heaven’s mechanisms, to also attain enduring firmness and eternal preservation?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“The great Dao is formless; it takes form through what it obtains. The great Dao is nameless; it takes names through what it possesses. Heaven and Earth obtain it, and it is called the *Qián-Kūn* Dao. The sun and moon obtain it, and it is called the *yin* and *yang* Dao. If humanity obtains it, in the court it is called the Dao of *junzi* and ministers; in the inner chambers, the Dao of husband and wife; in the village, the Dao of elders and juniors; in the schools, the Dao of friends; in the home, the Dao of father and son. Thus, all outward manifestations are governed by the Dao.\n\nAs for parents’ union: the father’s *yang* advances first, followed by *yin*, true *qi* meeting true water—heart-fire and kidney-water intermingling, refined into essence. Once essence emerges, the mother’s *yin* advances first, her water cleansing what is useless. Then the mother’s *yang* advances, her blood receiving at the palace’s gate. Essence and blood form the embryo, containing true *qi* within the mother’s womb. Over days and months, true *qi* transforms and gives birth to humanity, as Heaven and Earth move in their Dao—*Qián* and *Kūn* probing each other—generating the three *ming* and three *yang*s.\n\nTrue *qi* is *yang*; true water is *yin*. *Yang* is concealed within water; *yin* is concealed within *qi*. *Qi* governs ascent, yet within it lies true water. Water governs descent, yet within it lies true *qi*. True water is *true yin*; true *qi* is *true yang*. *True yang* descends with water, as *Qián* probes *Kūn*—above is *Zhèn*, middle is *Kàn*, below is *Gèn*. Compared to humanity, taking the center as measure, from above to below: *Zhèn* is the liver, *Kàn* the kidneys, *Gèn* the bladder.\n\n*True yin* ascends with *qi*, as *Kūn* probes *Qián*—below is *Xùn*, middle is *Lí*, above is *Duì*.”*\n\n「When comparing to humanity, taking the center as measure, from below to above: *Xùn* is the gallbladder, *Lí* the heart, *Duì* the lungs.\n\nOnce the forms are complete and the count is full, the Mother of Numbers departs.\nAfter birth, the original *yang* resides in the kidneys, from which true *qi* arises.\nTrue *qi* nourishes the heart, from which true essence is generated—true essence returns to its source.\nAscending and descending in ceaseless cycles, if there is no loss or deficiency, longevity naturally follows.\nIf one knows the proper timing without error, and can draw and replenish with measure, eternal life may be attained.\nIf one perseveres in cultivation without weariness, and ceaselessly upholds the practice, when *yin* is exhausted and *yang* is pure, one may transcend the mundane and attain sainthood.\n\nThis is the profound principle of Heaven’s mechanism, an untransmitted secret of ancient times.\nIf you, my Lord, trust in this with unwavering resolve,\ntreating fame as a shackle and affection as an enemy,\navoiding illness as one would shun death itself—\nthen guard against losing your essence to foreign vessels,\nand beware of dissipating your spirit among alien forms.\nHold fast to purity of mind, severing these roots at once,\nso that the original *yang* does not stray nor the true *qi* scatter.\nWhen *qi* flourishes and the *hún* has no *yin*,\nwhen *yang* is strong and the *pò* contains *qi*,\neach ascent and descent follows the model of Heaven and Earth,\neach waxing and waning mirrors the movement of sun and moon.»\n\n**Discourse on the Sun and Moon (Fourth Section)**\n\nLü said: *\"I have a rough grasp of Heaven and Earth’s principles, but how do the sun and moon’s courses, conjunctions, and oppositions relate to humanity? I wish to hear your explanation.\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The Dao is formless yet gives birth to Heaven and Earth. The Dao is nameless yet moves the sun and moon. The sun and moon are the refined essences of Great Yin and Great Yang, silently marking the degrees of Heaven and Earth’s union, aiding in the generation of all things. Rising and setting east and west, they divide day and night; moving north and south, they regulate cold and heat. Day and night never cease, cold and heat spur one another, and within the *pò*, the *hún* arises, while within the *hún*, the *pò* takes form. Their advances and retreats adhere to the numbers of Heaven and Earth, their comings and goings follow measured degrees, never deviating from Heaven and Earth’s appointed times.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Why do the sun’s eastward rise and westward set divide day and night?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"At the dawn of chaos, the primordial yellow defined its place. The form of Heaven and Earth resembles an egg; within the six extremes, it is round like a sphere. The sun and moon move above Heaven and below Earth, circling east and west, north and south, revolving like a wheel. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west; before it sets, it is day; after it sets and before it rises, it is night. Thus, the sun’s rising and setting divide day and night.\n\nAs for the moon, its rising and setting differ from the sun’s. It carries the *pò* in the west and receives the *hún* in the east, shining at night while the *hún* hides by day. Over accumulated days and hours, it sometimes rises, sometimes sets, moving from west to east. Initially, the *pò* within generates the *hún*—its form like a crescent bow at the first night, its light shining in the west. Next, the *pò* is half-filled with *hún*, corresponding to the upper crescent; at the first night, its light shines in the south. Then, the *pò* is fully filled with *hún*, opposing the sun; at the first night, its light shines in the east. Afterward, the *hún* within generates the *pò*—its form like a broken mirror at the first day, while the *hún* hides in the west. Next, the *hún* is half-filled with *pò*, corresponding to the lower crescent; at the first day, the *hún* hides in the south. Finally, the *hún* is fully filled with *pò*, opposing the sun; at the first day, the *hún* hides in the east. Thus, the moon’s rising and setting also divide day and night.\"*\n\n「Lǚ asked: *\"Why does the sun’s movement between south and north determine the cold and heat?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"After the Winter Solstice, the sun rises at the very beginning of the *chén* hour (5:00–7:00 AM) at fifty percent, and sets at the very end of the *shēn* hour (3:00–5:00 PM) at fifty percent. Beyond this point, its rising and setting shift from south to north, reaching their peak at the Summer Solstice. After the Summer Solstice, the sun rises at the very end of the *yín* hour (3:00–5:00 AM) at fifty percent, and sets at the very beginning of the *xū* hour (5:00–7:00 PM) at fifty percent. Beyond this point, its rising and setting shift from north to south, reaching their peak at the Winter Solstice. When the sun moves from south to north, from the Winter Solstice to the Summer Solstice, it transforms cold into heat. When it moves from north to south, from the Summer Solstice to the Winter Solstice, it transforms heat into cold. The days of summer are the nights of winter, and the days of winter are the nights of summer. After the Winter Solstice, the moon rises from north to south, akin to the sun’s days. After the Summer Solstice, the moon rises from south to north, akin to the sun’s nights. Thus, the sun and moon’s reciprocal movements determine the cold and heat.\"*\n\nLǚ asked: *\"The mechanisms of Heaven and Earth revolve in the rise and fall of yin and yang—how do these compare to human practice?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The mechanisms of Heaven and Earth lie in the rise and fall of yin and yang. Each rise and fall gives birth to the *Tàiji* (Supreme Polarity), nurturing and completing one another in an endless cycle. They never stray from the Dao, and thus endure forever. Those who cultivate the Dao—if they take Heaven and Earth as their model—can attain longevity and never die. If they emulate the sun and moon’s movements, their rising and setting, their conjunctions and separations, they reach the point where the moon absorbs the sun’s *hún* (essence), turning yang into yin. When yin is complete and yang is pure, the moon’s radiance becomes clear and bright, dispelling the dark *pò* (corporeal shadow) like the sun’s luminous splendor, illuminating all above and below. At this moment, it is as if a cultivator has refined their *qì* (vital energy) into *shén* (spirit), shed their physical form, and ascended to transcendence, achieving the essence of pure yang.\"*\n\nLǚ asked: *\"For those who seek to cultivate the true Dao and serve the Way, when studying the principles of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang rising and falling, as well as the sun and moon’s essence and their conjunctions, which should one prioritize?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"First, one should follow the mechanisms of Heaven. By applying the principles of yin and yang’s rising and falling, true water and true fire are united into one. Refined into the Great Elixir, it eternally settles in the *dāntián* (elixir field), enduring calamities without perishing, and granting a lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth. If one grows weary of the dusty world, yet persists in cultivation, they should then harness the sun and moon’s conjunctions, refining yang to govern yin and preventing yin’s emergence. By nourishing the spirit with *qì*, they ensure the spirit does not scatter. With the five *qì* (vital energies) converging at the *yuán* (origin), the three *huā* (blossoms) gather at the crown—cutting off all worldly attachments and returning to the Three Isles (三島).\"*\n\nLǚ said: *\"Such profound and penetrating practices—what ails them is the lack of proper timing.\"*\n\nZhōng said:\n*\"The yin and yang rising and falling of Heaven and Earth—once a year they unite. The essence of the sun and moon flows back and forth, uniting once a month. The vital *qì* and fluids of humankind unite once in a day and night.\"*\n\nFrom *Zhōng-Lǚ Chuándào Jí* (Discourse on Transmission of the Dao), *Lùn Sìshí* (On the Four Seasons), Fifth Chapter:\n\nLǚ said: *\"The unions of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon—can one truly grasp the timing of years, months, days, and hours?\"*\n\nZhōng replied:\n*\"There are four gradations of time. A human lifespan spans a hundred years: from one year to thirty is the time of youthful vigor, from thirty to sixty is the time of full maturity, from sixty to ninety is the time of old age, and from ninety to a hundred—or even a hundred and twenty—is the time of decline. This is the first gradation: the time within the body.\n\nIf one divides a day into twelve *chén* (double-hours), five *chén* as one *hòu* (watch), three *hòu* as one *qì* (phase), three *qì* as one *jié* (seasonal node), and two *jié* as one *shí* (season), then there are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. When it is spring, yin contains half-yang, and the *qì* shifts from cold to warmth—that is the time of spring. When it is summer, yang contains full yang, and the *qì* shifts from warmth to heat—that is the time of summer. When it is autumn, yang contains half-yin, and the *qì* shifts from heat to cool—that is the time of autumn. When it is winter, yin contains full yin, and the *qì* shifts from cool to cold—that is the time of winter. This is the second gradation: the time within the year.\n\nIf one takes the *lǚ* (sixth tone) rising from *lǘ* (fifth tone) and *lǘ* rising from *lǚ*, then in a month of thirty days, there are three hundred and sixty *chén*, three thousand *kè* (moments), and one hundred and eighty ten-thousandths. From the new moon to the first quarter, yin contains half-yang. From the first quarter to the full moon, yang contains full yang. From the full moon to the last quarter, yang contains half-yin. From the last quarter to the dark moon, yin contains full yin. This is the third gradation: the time within the month.\n\nIf one divides sixty *fēn* (minutes) as one *kè*, eight *kè* and twenty *fēn* as one *shí* (hour), and one *shí* and a half as one *guà* (trigram), then the *guà* determines the eight directions, and its correctness divides the four cardinal positions. From *zǐ* (11 PM–1 AM) to *mǎo* (5–7 AM), yin contains half-yang, and from *Tàimíng* (Great Brightness) arises *Shàoyáng* (Lesser Yang). From *mǎo* to *wǔ* (11 AM–1 PM), yang contains full yang, and pure *Shàoyáng* arises *Tàiyáng* (Greater Yang). From *wǔ* to *yǒu* (5–7 PM), yang contains half-yin, and from *Tàiyáng* arises *Shàoyīn* (Lesser Yin). From *yǒu* to *zǐ*, yin contains full yin, and pure *Shàoyīn* arises *Tàiyīn* (Greater Yin). This is the fourth gradation: the time within the day.\n\nWhat is hard to obtain yet easy to lose is the time within the body; what departs swiftly yet returns slowly is the time within the year. Like lightning, swift as a falling stone is the time within the day. Days accumulate into months, months into years—years slip by, and time races forward. Chasing fame and profit while the restless mind remains unchecked, loving children and doting on grandchildren while affection still lingers. Even if one turns back to the Dao, how can one contend with aging and declining *qì*? Like spring snow or autumn flowers, only fleeting beauty remains; like evening sun or morning moon, no lasting light endures.\n\nThose who follow the Dao find the time within the body hard to obtain. In the radiant sun and charming scenery, a hundred blossoms bloom fragrant. In pavilions by the water or towering halls, the cool breeze brings delight. Under moonlit nights in leisurely talk, or snow-filled days in shared drink—indulging in boundless pleasures, wasting limited time. Even if one turns back to the Dao, it must be when sickness binds them. Like a broken boat yet to cross, who would not seek rescue? Like a leaking roof needing repair, who would abandon hope of mending it? Those who follow the Dao have wasted their youthful years in vain.\n\nBefore the rooster crows, stepping out feels too late. When the street drums sound, returning home feels too early. Greed and delusion refuse to pause, vain thoughts fear no end. A hall filled with gold and jade—what use when sickness strikes? A single glance at grandchildren—who can replace the breath that fades? Day and night pass without cease, yet none awaken. Those who follow the Dao lament the time within the day.\n\nLǚ said: *\"The time within the body, the time within the year, the time within the month, and the time within the day—all are time. Yet you, Master, say the time within the body is hard to obtain, and the time within the day is most regrettable. Why?\"*\n\nZhōng replied:\n*\"Those who follow the Dao find youth hard to obtain. Cultivating in youth strengthens the primordial roots—all things are easily accomplished, and great success may be achieved in a thousand days. Those who follow the Dao also find middle age hard to obtain. Cultivating in middle age first completes what was lacking, then advances further. Initially, one reverses aging to return to youth, then enters the realm of transcending humanity. If one does not awaken in youth nor reflect in middle age, perhaps through calamity they turn to quietude, or through illness they aspire to the lofty. Cultivating in old age first addresses preservation, then speaks of nourishment. Then, through minor accomplishments, one accumulates *qì* until reaching middle attainment, and from middle attainment, one reverses aging to return to youth, refining the form to dwell in the world. Yet the five *qì* cannot converge at the *yuán* (origin), and the three yangs struggle to gather at the crown. Ascending as an immortal, transcending the physical—such fates are beyond reach. Thus, the time within the body is hard to obtain.\"*\n\n吕问：“身中之时固知难得矣，而日中之时可惜者，何也？”\n钟答：“人之一日如日月之一月，如天地之一年。大道生育天地，天地分位，上下相去八万四千里。冬至之后，地中阳升；凡一气十五日，上进七千里，计一百八十日。阳升至天，太极生阴。夏至之后，天中阴降；凡一气十五日，下进七千里，计一百八十日。阴降至地，太极复生阳。周而复始，运行不已，而不失于道，故能长久。运行日月，日月成形，周围各得八百四十里。月旦之后，六中起九：凡一日计十二时，魄中魂进七十里，凡十五日，计一百八十时，魄中魂进八百四十里。月望之后，九中起六：凡一日计十二时，魂中魄进七十里，凡十五日，计一百八十时，魂中魄进八百四十里。周而复始，运行不已，而不失于道，故能坚固。\n\n大道长养万物，万物之中，最灵最贵者，人也。人之心肾，上下相远八寸四分，阴阳升降，与天地无二等。气中生液，液中生气，气液相生，与日月可同途。天地以乾坤相索，阴阳升降，一年一交合，不失于道，故一年之后有一年。日月以魂魄相生而精华往来，一月一交合，不失于道，故一月之后有一月。然人之交合，虽在一昼一夜，不知交会之时，又无采取之法。损时又不解补，益时又不解收；阴交时不解养阳，阳交时不解炼阴。月中不知损益，日中又无行持。过了一年无一年，过了一日无一日。当风卧湿，冒暑涉寒，不肯修持，而甘心受病，虚过时光，端坐候死。”\n\n吕曰：“奉道之人，非不知年光虚度，岁月磋跎，而疾病缠身，死限将至。盖以修炼不知法，行持不知时，致阴阳交合有差，时月行持无准。”\n\n钟曰：“身中用年，年中用月，月中用日，日中用时。盖以五脏之气，月上有盛衰，日上有进退，时上有交合。运行五度而气传六候。金、木、水、火、土，分列无差；东、西、南、北、中，生成有数。炼精生真气，炼气合阳神，炼神合大道。”\n\nLü said: *\"When you speak of the Five Viscera’s *qi* as Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, and of the Five Phases’ positions as East, South, West, North, and Center—how do they interact in mutual generation and completion, with their unions and adoptions occurring at specific times? How do they take and refine at appointed moments? I wish to hear your explanation.\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The Dao, having first differentiated to give birth to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth having divided to establish the Five Sovereigns. The East is the Azure Sovereign, who governs the Spring season, and within the Yin, raises the Yang to make all things sprout. The South is the Vermilion Sovereign, who governs the Summer season, and within the Yang, generates the Yang to make all things flourish. The West is the White Sovereign, who governs the Autumn season, and within the Yang, raises the Yin to make all things mature. The North is the Dark Sovereign, who governs the Winter season, and within the Yin, advances the Yin to make all things wither. Each season comprises ninety days. Within each season, eighteen days belong to the Yellow Sovereign. In Spring, he assists the Azure Sovereign in generating growth; in Summer, he follows the Vermilion Sovereign in fostering maturation; in Autumn, he aids the White Sovereign in establishing completion; in Winter, he restrains the Dark Sovereign with stern authority. The Five Sovereigns govern in rotation, each presiding over seventy-two days, totaling three hundred sixty days for a year, assisting Heaven and Earth in adhering to the Dao.\n\nThe Azure Sovereign’s offspring are *Jiǎ-Yǐ*, *Jiǎ-Yǐ* of the East, the Wood phase. The Vermilion Sovereign’s offspring are *Bǐng-Dīng*, *Bǐng-Dīng* of the South, the Fire phase. The Yellow Sovereign’s offspring are *Wù-Jǐ*, *Wù-Jǐ* of the Center, the Earth phase. The White Sovereign’s offspring are *Gēng-Xīn*, *Gēng-Xīn* of the West, the Metal phase. The Dark Sovereign’s offspring are *Rén-Gǔi*, *Rén-Gǔi* of the North, the Water phase.\n\nManifested in the seasons as symbols, Wood is the Azure Dragon, Fire the Vermilion Bird, Earth the Hooked Array, Metal the White Tiger, and Water the Dark Tortoise. Manifested in the seasons as living things, when *Yǐ* and *Gēng* combine, in Spring there is the elm—green and white, not deviating from Metal and Wood’s hues. When *Xīn* and *Bǐng* combine, in Autumn there is the date—white and red, not deviating from Metal and Fire’s hues. When *Jǐ* and *Gēng* combine, at the end of Summer and beginning of Autumn, there is the melon—green and yellow, not deviating from Earth and Wood’s hues. When *Dīng* and *Rén* combine, in Summer there is the mulberry—red and black, not deviating from Water and Fire’s hues. When *Gǔi* and *Wù* combine, in Winter there is the tangerine—black and yellow, not deviating from Water and Earth’s hues.\n\nBy this analogy, the Five Sovereigns’ interactions, as they manifest in the seasons and give rise to living things, are innumerable.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"If the Five Phases manifest in the seasons in this way, how do they manifest in the human body?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"In humans, the head is round and the feet are square—mirroring the forms of Heaven and Earth. The rise and fall of yin and yang reflect the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth. The kidneys correspond to Water, the heart to Fire, the liver to Wood, the lungs to Metal, and the spleen to Earth. If we consider the Five Phases generating one another, then Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, and Metal generates Water. The generator is the mother; the generated is the child. If we consider the Five Phases restraining one another, then Water restrains Fire, Fire restrains Metal, Metal restrains Wood, Wood restrains Earth, and Earth restrains Water. The restrainer is the husband; the restrained is the wife.\n\nIn terms of mother-child relationships: the qi of the kidneys generates the qi of the liver, the qi of the liver generates the qi of the heart, the qi of the heart generates the qi of the spleen, the qi of the spleen generates the qi of the lungs, and the qi of the lungs generates the qi of the kidneys. In terms of husband-wife relationships: the qi of the kidneys restrains the qi of the heart, the qi of the heart restrains the qi of the lungs, the qi of the lungs restrains the qi of the liver, the qi of the liver restrains the qi of the spleen, and the qi of the spleen restrains the qi of the kidneys. The kidneys are the heart’s husband, the liver’s mother, the spleen’s wife, and the lungs’ child. The liver is the spleen’s husband, the heart’s mother, the lungs’ wife, and the kidneys’ child. The heart is the lungs’ husband, the spleen’s mother, the kidneys’ wife, and the liver’s child. The lungs are the liver’s husband, the kidneys’ mother, the heart’s wife, and the spleen’s child. The spleen is the kidneys’ husband, the lungs’ mother, the liver’s wife, and the heart’s child.\n\nThe heart’s manifestations within are the vessels; externally, they appear as complexion, with the tongue as its gateway. It is subdued by the kidneys and directed toward the lungs—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the liver, it flourishes; when it encounters the spleen, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The kidneys’ manifestations within are the bones; externally, they appear as hair, with the ears as its gateway. It is subdued by the spleen and directed toward the heart—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the lungs, it flourishes; when it encounters the liver, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The liver’s manifestations within are the sinews; externally, they appear as nails, with the eyes as its gateway. It is subdued by the lungs and directed toward the spleen—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it encounters the kidneys, it flourishes; when it encounters the heart, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The lungs’ manifestations within are the skin; externally, they appear as fur, with the nostrils as its gateway. It is subdued by the heart and directed toward the liver—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the spleen, it flourishes; when it encounters the kidneys, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The spleen’s manifestations within are the viscera, nourishing the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Externally, they appear as flesh, with the lips and mouth as its gateway. Its inhalation and exhalation are regulated; it is subdued by the liver and directed toward the kidneys—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the heart, it flourishes; when it encounters the lungs, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. Thus, the Five Phases in the human body generate and restrain one another, transmitting qi as husband-wife and mother-child, revealing their waxing and waning here.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The heart is Fire—how does Fire descend? The kidneys are Water—how does Water ascend? The spleen is Earth. Earth, being central, supports Fire and yet inevitably restrains Water below. The lungs are Metal. Metal, being above, interfaces with Fire below and thus is diminished—how then can Water be generated? Those that generate are separated by intervals, while those that restrain are close and difficult to shift. How can these Five Phases, which inherently harm and restrain one another, be reconciled?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The Five Phases return to their origins, linked by a single qi. The primal yang ascends and refines true Water; true Water undergoes transformation and generates true qi; true qi undergoes transformation and generates the yang spirit. Initially, the Five Phases are positioned, establishing one husband and one wife. The kidneys are Water, yet Water contains Metal. Though Metal generates Water, when descending, one must recognize the Metal within Water. Water inherently resists Earth, so after gathering medicine, one must return Earth to Water.\n\nThe dragon is the liver’s symbol, the tiger the lungs’ form. The yang dragon emerges from the *Lí* mansion, the yin tiger arises from the *Kǎn* position. The Five Phases move in reverse. Qi is transmitted to the mother. From *Zǐ* to *Wǔ*, this is called ‘yang time generating yang’—the Five Phases invert, and fluids flow between husband and wife. From *Wǔ* to *Zǐ*, this is called ‘refining yang within yin.’ Yang cannot form without yin, and ultimately, without yin, there is no death. Yin cannot generate without yang, and ultimately, without yang, life is prolonged.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The Five Phases originate from the unity of yin and yang qi. What is meant by ‘one qi’?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"This one qi—when father and mother unite, their essence and blood transform to form shape. The kidneys generate the spleen, the spleen generates the liver, the liver generates the lungs, the lungs generate the heart, the heart generates the small intestine, the small intestine generates the large intestine, the large intestine generates the gallbladder, the gallbladder generates the stomach, and the stomach generates the bladder. This is how yin, through essence and blood, transforms to form shape. Its yang remains at the origin of its initial generation—a single point of primal yang residing in the two kidneys.\n\nMoreover, the kidneys are Water, yet Water contains Fire. This Fire ascends as qi, and through qi, it ascends to meet the heart. The heart is yang; combining yang with yang, the *Tàijí* generates yin, accumulating qi to produce fluids. The fluids descend from the heart and, through fluids, descend back to the kidneys. The liver is originally the heart’s mother and the kidneys’ child, transmitting the kidneys’ qi to the heart. The lungs are originally the heart’s wife and the kidneys’ mother, transmitting the heart’s fluids to the kidneys. Thus, the ascent and descent of qi and fluids mirror the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe liver and lungs transmit and conduct like the moon’s and sun’s reciprocal movement.\n\nThe Five Phases name this numerical principle.\nDiscussing their interplay and generation, it is the primal yang—one qi—as the foundation.\nWithin qi, fluids form; within fluids, qi arises.\nThe kidneys are the root of qi, the heart the source of fluids.\n\nThe numinous root is firm yet hazy and indistinct—within qi, true water spontaneously generates.\nThe heart’s source is pure yet dim and obscure—within fluids, true fire inherently resides.\nWithin fire, recognize the true Dragon; within water, discern the true Tiger.\nWhen Dragon and Tiger intermingle, they transform into the Yellow Sprout.\nWhen united at the Yellow Sprout, they coalesce into the Great Elixir—thus called *Jīndān*.\nWhen the *Jīndān* is complete, it is called *Shénxiān*.\n\nLü said: *\"When the *Jīndān* is perfected and the physical form is cast off to ascend as an immortal, returning to the Ten Directions, this is indeed known.\"*\n\nHow then is it called the Yellow Sprout?\nZhōng replied: *\"The true Dragon and true Tiger are what it refers to.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What are the Dragon and Tiger?\"*\nZhōng replied: *\"The Dragon is not the liver—it is the yang Dragon, emerging from the true water within the *Lí* Palace.\nThe Tiger is not the lungs—it is the yin Tiger, arising from the true fire within the *Kǎn* position.\"*\n\n**Discourse on Water and Fire, Section Seven**\n\nLü said: *\"For one who seeks longevity, the refining of the Golden Elixir is the path. To refine the Golden Elixir, one must first obtain the Yellow Sprout. To obtain the Yellow Sprout, one must first secure the Dragon and Tiger. As they say, the true Dragon emerges from the *Lí* Palace, and the true Tiger arises from the *Kǎn* position. Within *Lí* and *Kǎn*, there is water and fire. But what do these water and fire refer to?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"All within the body that is spoken of as water—such as the Four Seas, Five Lakes, Nine Rivers, Three Islands, the Hua Pool, Yao Pool, Phoenix Pool, Heavenly Pool, Royal Pool, Kun Pool, Yuan Pond, Lang Gardens, Divine Water, Golden Waves, Jade Dew, Jade Spring, Yang Ruxiao (lit. 'yang suet'), and White Snow—these are the names, and they cannot be fully enumerated. All within the body that is spoken of as fire are but the Sovereign Fire, Ministerial Fire, and Common Fire. These three fires take their root in the Original Yang, and from it arises the True Qi. When True Qi gathers, one attains peace; when True Qi weakens, one falls ill. If one dissipates True Qi and flees Original Yang, when Original Yang is exhausted and Pure Yang remains, the Original Spirit departs the body—then one is said to die.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Within the human body, from a single point of Original Yang, the three fires emerge. These three fires arise from the myriad waters and dense yin, easily dissipated yet difficult to ignite. When this yang is weak and yin is strong, fire is scarce and water is abundant, causing one to decline swiftly and fail to attain longevity. How then does one address this?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The Heart is the Sea of Blood, the Kidneys the Sea of Qi, the Brain the Sea of Marrow, and the Spleen-Stomach the Sea of Water and Grain—such are these Four Seas. The Five Viscera each possess their own fluids, governing their respective positions east, west, south, north, and center—such are these Five Lakes. The Small Intestine, twenty-four feet long and winding nine times above and below, is called the Nine Rivers; beneath it lies the Yuan Pond. The forehead is the Upper Island, the heart the Central Island, and the kidneys the Lower Island—within these Three Islands lie the roots and Lang Gardens. The Hua Pool lies beneath the Yellow Court, the Yao Pool emerges before the Elixir Gate, the Kun Pool ascends to meet the Jade Capital, the Heavenly Pool aligns with the Inner Palace, the Phoenix Pool is between the Heart and Lungs, and the Jade Pool lies within the lips and teeth. Divine Water is generated within the Qi, and Golden Waves descend from Heaven. Where the Vermilion Dragon resides, there are naturally Jade Dew and Jade Springs. Only after the fetal transformation is complete does one see White Snow and Yang Ruxiao. Nourishment has its seasons; when the flames are strong, one first calls it Jade Dew, then Golden Dew—both can restore the Elixir. Oil is added in measure, in response to bathing: first called Zhōng Tián (lit. 'Central Field'), then Xià Tián (lit. 'Lower Field')—both can refine the form. Jade Medicine and Golden Flowers transmute into the Yellow and White substances; the clarified butter and sweet dew are refined into wondrous fragrances.\n\nSuch are the functions of water. As for the Common Fire ascending to aid the Kidney-Qi in generating True Water; when Kidney-Water ascends to merge with Heart-Fluids and produce True Qi—then in its lesser application, it subdues demons and dispels illness, and in its greater, it refines the substance and ignites the Elixir. When the Microcosmic Orbit is employed, Fire rises to consume the body; when the Yang Barrier is constrained, one returns to the Original Elixir-Medicine. Distinguishing the Nine Regions’ influence nourishes the Yang-Spirit; burning the Three Corpses’ burdens dispels the Yin-Ghosts. Ascending, it strikes the Three Passes; descending, it erodes the Seven Souls. Refining the form into Qi enables flight as though weightless; refining Qi into Spirit allows shedding the body like a serpent’s molt. Such are the functions of Fire.\"*\n\n「Lü said: *\"At first, I heard the command: my concern was that Fire was too little and Water too much, making it easy to decline and decay. Next, I listened to lofty teachings, and realized that Water and Fire have such profound effects. Ultimately, how does one achieve transformation? How can the lesser overcome the greater, and the weak attain strength?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"When the Yin of the Two Eights is exhausted and the Yang of the Nine Threes flourishes, the Vermilion Elixir-Dan [金丹] will soon be formed, and through Seven Returns and Nine Refinements [七返九还], the Embryonic Immortal [胎仙] will transform itself. True Qi resides in the Heart, and the Heart is the source of Fluids. Original Yang [元阳] dwells in the Kidney, and the Kidney is the sea of Qi. The Bladder is the Common Fire [民火], but if it does not ascend to become the Celestial Fire [天机], it cannot be put to use, and the Bladder is also the repository of Fluids. If one fails to grasp the Celestial Mechanism [天机] or fathom the Mysterious Principles [玄理], practitioners of the Dao will struggle to achieve transformation and may not escape illness and death.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The transformation you speak of—whereby Yang flourishes, Yin is exhausted, and the Vermilion Elixir-Dan is formed, resulting in the Embryonic Immortal’s self-transmutation—how is this accomplished?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"The Heart and Kidney are separated by eight inches and four divisions, which reflects the fixed ratio of Heaven and Earth. The generation of Qi and Fluids from the Great Ultimate [气液太极] mirrors the union of Yin and Yang. The twelve hours of a day correspond to the twelve months of a year.\n\nThe Heart generates Fluids, not of its own accord, but because Lung-Fluids descend and Heart-Fluids flow. The Fluids move between the *husband* [夫] and *wife* [妇]—from above to below, returning to the lower fields—thus it is said: *the wife returns to the husband’s palace* [妇还夫宫].\n\nThe Kidney generates Qi, not of its own accord, but because Bladder-Qi ascends and Kidney-Qi flows. The Qi moves between the *parent* [父] and *child* [子]—from below to above, paying homage to the Central Original [朝中元]—thus it is said: *the husband returns to the wife’s chamber* [夫还妇室].\n\nLiver-Qi guides and draws the Kidney-Qi upward, from below to above, until it reaches the Heart. The Heart is Fire; when the two Qi intermingle and steam in the Lung, the Lung-Fluids descend, and all Fluids originating from the Heart are called *Heart-generated Fluids* [心生液]. Since these Fluids are generated in the Heart and do not dissipate, they are called *True Fire* [真火].\n\nThe Lung-Fluids convey the Heart-Fluids downward, from above to below, until they reach the Kidney. The Kidney is Water; when the two Waters intermingle, they moisten the Bladder, and the Bladder-Qi ascends, all rising from the Kidney being called *Qi* [气]. Since this Qi is generated in the Kidney and does not wear away, it is also called *True Fire* [真火].\n\nTrue Fire emerges from within Water—vague and indistinct, yet something exists within it. You cannot see it, nor can you grasp it.\n\nTrue Water emerges from within Fire—deep and obscure, yet something vital exists within it. You may perceive it, but cannot retain it; you may retain it, but it will not stay.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The Kidney is Water, yet Qi arises from Water—this is called True Fire. What is the *thing* [物] within Fire? The Heart is Fire, yet Fluids arise from Fire—this is called True Water. What is the *vital essence* [精] within Water? If the *thing* within Water and the *vital essence* within Water have no discernible form, and even if you seek them, they are difficult to obtain—let alone their practical use—what are they for?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"The sages of antiquity, upon attaining the Dao, did not depart from these two *things*. Through their copulation, they cultivated the Yellow Sprout [黄芽], and with sufficient practice, they perfected the Embryo and formed the Great Elixir-Medicine [大药], becoming the True Dragon and True Tiger.\"*」\n\n**Discourse on the Dragon and Tiger (Eighth Section)**\n\nLü said: *\"The Dragon originates from the Liver’s form, the Tiger from the Lung’s shape. Within this Heart Fire, Fluids arise—these are True Water. Within Water, dim and obscure, the True Dragon hides. Though the Dragon is not of the Liver, how does it emerge from the *Li* mansion? Within this Kidney Water, Qi arises—this is True Fire. Within Fire, vague and indistinct, the True Tiger is concealed. Though the Tiger is not of the Lung, how does it issue from the *Kàn* position?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"The Dragon is a yang entity. It ascends and soars in Heaven, its cry summoning clouds, and with dew, it nourishes all things. In symbol, it is the Azure Dragon; in direction, *jiǎ-yǐ*; in element, Wood; in season, Spring; in the Dao, Benevolence; in the hexagram, *Zhèn*; within the five viscera of the body, it is the Liver. The Tiger is a yin entity. It races across Earth, its roar birthing wind, and with mountains, it commands all beasts. In symbol, it is the White Tiger; in direction, *gēng-xīn*; in element, Metal; in season, Autumn; in the Dao, Righteousness; in the hexagram, *Duì*; within the five viscera of the body, it is the Lung.\n\nNow, the Liver is yang, yet it resides within a yin position. Thus, Kidney Qi transmits to Liver Qi—Qi flows from child to mother, generating Water from Water. When Kidney Qi is sufficient, Liver Qi arises, and once Liver Qi is born, it severs the Kidney’s residual yin, allowing pure yang Qi to ascend.\n\nThe Lung is yin, yet it dwells within a yang position. Thus, Heart Fluids transmit to Lung Fluids—Fluids circulate between husband and wife, with Fire overcoming Metal. When Heart Fluids arrive, Lung Fluids are born, and once Lung Fluids manifest, they sever the Heart’s residual yang, allowing pure yin Fluids to descend.\n\nBecause the Liver belongs to yang and severs the Kidney’s residual yin, when Qi passes through the Liver, it becomes pure yang. Within pure yang Qi, the True One Water is concealed—vague and formless—named the *yang Dragon*. Because the Lung belongs to yin and severs the Heart’s residual yang, when Fluids reach the Lung, they become pure yin. Within pure yin Fluids, the True yang Qi is borne—dim and unseen—named the *yin Tiger*.\n\nQi ascends, Fluids descend; originally, they cannot intermingle. Yet within Qi, the True One Water meets Fluids to unite, and within Fluids, the True yang Qi gathers with Qi of its own accord. If, during transmission, one adheres to the method, ensuring Kidney Qi does not stray—collecting the True One Water within Qi—and Heart Fluids do not dissipate—extracting the True yang Qi within Fluids—then child and mother meet, mutually cherishing, daily gaining the *Tài Mǐ*’s greatness.\n\nA hundred days without flaw, the medicine’s power is complete. Three hundred days, the sacred embryo solidifies; three hundred days, the immortal fetus is perfected. Its form is like a pill, its hue like cinnabar and tangerine—named the *Dan-Yào*—eternally settled in the lower field. Retaining form in the world, enduring the great calamity and attaining longevity, these are the *land-bound celestial immortals.\"*\n\nLǚ said:\n\"The Kidney Water generates Qi, and within Qi lies the True One Water, named *Yīnhǔ* [the Yin Tiger], for the Tiger appears when meeting with Fluids. The Heart Fire generates Fluids, and within Fluids lies the True yang Qi, named *Yánglóng* [the yang Dragon], for the Dragon appears when merging with Qi. Things of like kind gather, and creatures group by nature—this is only right.\n\nWhen Qi is generated, Fluids descend as well. Does the True One Water within Qi not follow the Fluids downward, transmitting itself to the Five Viscera? When Fluids are generated, Qi ascends. Does the True yang Qi within Fluids not follow Qi upward, emerging from the *Chónglóu* [Double Tower, i.e., the upper orifices]?\n\nThe True Water descends with the Fluids—how then can the Tiger mate with the Dragon? The True yang ascends with the Qi—how then can the Dragon mate with the Tiger? If the Dragon and Tiger do not mate, how can the *Huángyá* [Yellow Sprout, i.e., the embryonic Qi] arise? If the Yellow Sprout does not appear, how can the Great Medicine be formed?\"\n\nZhōng said:\n\"Once Kidney Qi is generated, it is like the sun rising from the sea—mist and dew cannot obscure its radiance. The descending Fluids are like sparse and porous barriers—how can they overcome its Qi? When Qi is strong, the True One Water will naturally flourish.\n\nOnce Heart Fluids are generated, they are like the killing cold of winter—breath and exhortation cannot resist their chill. The ascending Qi is like a jade screen—how can it overcome the Fluids? When Fluids are abundant, the True yang Qi may be strong or weak—this cannot be determined.\"\n\nLǚ said:\n\"Qi and Fluids are generated at their own times. When the time for Qi arises, Qi prevails, and the True One Water also flourishes. When the time for Fluids arises, Fluids prevail, and the True yang Qi also flourishes. If the flourishing and decline are uncertain, why is that?\"\n\nZhōng said:\n\"The kidney *qi* is easily dissipated and hard to preserve—this is the True Tiger. The heart Fluids are difficult to accumulate but easily lost—this is the True Dragon. Though the *Dan* scriptures number ten thousand volumes, their debates never stray beyond yin and yang. Yet within these two principles, all essence lies in the Dragon and Tiger. Among those who follow the Dao, only one or two in ten thousand truly grasp it. Some, through vast learning and memorization, may know the principles of Dragon and Tiger, yet fail to recognize their union or the method of refining them. Thus, sages past and present, though they devote their lives to cultivation, achieve only minor success. Generations pass with prolonged lifespans, yet none attain transcendence. Truly, it is because they cannot copulate the Dragon and Tiger, nor gather the Yellow Sprout to forge the elixir.\"\n\nFrom *Zhōng-Lǚ Transmission of the Dao Collection*, *Discourse on the Elixir*, Chapter Nine:\n\nLǚ said:\n\"Since the principles of Dragon and Tiger are already known, may we then speak of the Golden Elixir and Great Medicine?\"\n\nZhōng said:\n\"What is called *yào* [medicine] is that which cures disease. Diseases fall into three categories:\n\nWhen exposed to wind, dampness, summer heat, or winter cold, when labor or rest is excessive, when hunger or satiety is untimely, or when one disregards natural order—this is called *huàn* [affliction], a disease of the seasons.\n\nWhen one refuses cultivation, indulges in desires, dissipates primordial yang, and depletes true *qi*, growing gaunt with age—this is called *lǎo* [old age], a disease of time.\n\nWhen *qi* is exhausted, the body hollowed, the soul dispersed, and the spirit spent, with a final sigh as the Four Great Elements dissolve—when the corpse lies abandoned in the wilderness—this is called *sǐ* [death], a disease of the body.\n\nNow, seasonal afflictions follow the revolutions of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. When yang is excessive and yin deficient, one treats with coolness. When yin is excessive and yang deficient, one treats with warmth. The elderly tend to cold, the young to heat; the obese to phlegm, the emaciated to stagnation. Men’s diseases arise from *qi*, women’s from blood. Replenish the deficient and reduce the excessive; preserve the weak and diminish the surplus. Minor cases may be treated with acupuncture and moxibustion; severe cases with medicinal decoctions. Though there are afflictions from disregard of natural order, and though seasonal diseases may be entrusted to wise physicians, who prescribe remedies to ensure recovery—how then does one treat the disease of old age? How does one cure the disease of death?\"\n\nThe cleansing of the intestines and replenishing of the flesh—this was the skill of the ancient masters of medicine, whose wrinkled faces and white hair returned them to the appearance of youth, yet none could comprehend their methods.\n\nThe replacement of the skull and extension of limbs—this was the skill of the ancient masters of medicine, who preserved their forms and remained in the world to attain longevity, yet none could comprehend their methods.\n\nLü said: *\"When the Dao is not followed in its proper order, diseases arise from the seasons; skilled physicians and fine medicines can indeed cure them. But how does one treat the ailment of failing years? How does one cure the suffering of exhausted *qi* and the end of life? Is there no medicine for these?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"All diseases have three degrees. Seasonal diseases are treated with medicines of grasses and woods, and they heal on their own. Diseases of the body, diseases of age—these are treated with medicines of two kinds: the first is called *inner elixir* (内丹), the second is called *outer elixir* (外丹).\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What is the *outer elixir*?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"In ancient times, the Highest Celestial Lord transmitted the Dao to the mortal realm, pointing and hinting at the principles of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the harmony of the sun and moon’s cycles. Since then, the elixir scriptures have spread throughout the world, and people have heard of the Great Dao.\n\nThe Master Guǎngchéng instructed the Yellow Emperor, and in his moments of governance, the Yellow Emperor followed the methods in accordance with the Dao. Though he persisted for long, he saw no effect.\n\nThe Master Guǎngchéng spoke of the true *qi* and true water between heart and kidney, the true yin and true yang between *qi* and water. When these are harmonized, they become the Great Medicine, comparable to gold and stone yet hidden as a treasure.\n\nThus, within the Kǒngtóng Mountains, he refined the Great Elixir through inner cultivation. In eight minerals, he used only cinnabar, from which he extracted mercury. Among five metals, he used only galena, from which he extracted silver. Mercury corresponds to the yang dragon, silver to the yin tiger. The heart’s fire is like the red of cinnabar, the kidney’s water like the black of galena. The annual fire follows its season, never failing the strategy of heaven and earth; the monthly fire is nurtured by oil, dividing the aptness of the civil and martial. He built a furnace of three tiers, each nine inches high, square outside and round within. He gathered the *qi* of the eight directions, responding to the signs of the four seasons. The shape of the golden cauldron, containing galena and mercury, is no different from the vital essence of the lungs. Sulfur serves as the medicine, combined with refined cinnabar, resembling the *huángpó* (黄婆)—three years for minor completion, taking it cures a hundred ailments. Six years for full completion, taking it extends one’s years. Nine years for great completion, taking it enables one to ascend and descend at will.\"*\n\nThe valiant man stretches his arms—\na span of ten thousand leagues.\nThough he cannot return to Penglai,\nhe may yet escape the calamities of mortal life and live forever.\n\nLü said, *\"Since ancient times, many have sought to refine the elixir, yet few have seen its fruits. Why is this?\"*\n\nZhōng replied, *\"Those who fail in elixir refinement fall into three categories:\n\nFirst, they fail to distinguish true from false in their medicinal materials, or they do not master the timing of heating and cooling—thus, precious substances are wasted in smoke and flame, reduced to ash. They squander time and effort, achieving nothing.\n\nSecond, even if their materials are fine, they do not grasp the proper fire control. Or if they know the fire control, they lack the materials. These two failings, unaligned, yield no result.\n\nThird, even if their materials are fine and the fire control is apt—never straying from the yearly, monthly, daily rhythms, with precise additions and subtractions, the *qi* full and the elixir complete—yet their external practices are incomplete. They transform into a *huángehè* (玄鹤) and soar into the sky, but without the means to take the elixir, their efforts are in vain.\n\nMoreover, medicinal materials are the refined *qi* of heaven and earth condensed into form, while fire control is the technique of Daoist cultivation to attain the Way. In the age of the Three Sovereigns, the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir, requiring nine transformations to complete. In the age of the Five Emperors, the *Hunyuan* elixir took three years to perfect.\n\nBy the Warring States period, malevolent *qi* filled the void, corpses littered the fields, and living things could no longer absorb the refined *qi* of heaven and earth. Thus, medicinal materials grew scarce, and those who possessed the methods perished in exile or old age in the mountains and valleys. Even if elixir formulas and Daoist techniques were recorded on bamboo or silk, over time they decayed and were lost to the world.\n\nIf one claims medicinal materials exist in the mortal realm, then Qin Shǐhuáng would not have sought them in distant islands. If one claims elixir formulas exist in the mortal realm, then Wei Boyang would not have consulted the *Zhouyi* or relied on broad learning and rote memorization, only to mislead later generations—leading to ruined families and no success. To seek them externally is also a mistake.\"*\n\nLü said, *\"The principles of external elixir refinement stem from Guangchéngzǐ. Following internal practices as its standard, even if one succeeds, it takes nine years to complete. And since medicinal materials are hard to obtain and formulas even harder, at best one may ascend—yet none have truly transcended mortality to return to the Ten Isles.\n\nMay I inquire about internal alchemy?\"*\n\nLu said, *\"External alchemy is not without use. Those who follow the Dao, awakening only in their later years, have roots that are not yet firmly established. The kidneys are the root of qi—without deep roots, the branches cannot flourish. The heart is the source of fluids—without pure waters, the flow cannot endure. One must rely on the Five Metals and Eight Stones, accumulating day after day, month after month, refining them into Three Grades. Each grade has Three Degrees, making Nine Grades in total. The Great Elixirs of Dragon and Tiger assist in nourishing the True Qi, refining the form so that one may dwell in the world with effortless lightness, ascending like flight. If one practices internal alchemy and understands the timing of union, knowing the methods of gathering—when the Embryonic Immortal is complete, one may achieve transcendence in days.\n\nThose who do not awaken, clinging to external elixirs, burn with reckless fire, taking them with hopes of ascending to the celestial realms—how laughable! Since they fail to investigate the origins of external alchemy, I shall instead expound upon the principles of internal alchemy. The medicinal materials of internal alchemy arise from the heart and kidneys—these all people possess. The true elixir’s materials are inherently within Heaven and Earth, visible daily. The fire’s intensity follows the cycles of the sun and moon, and its cultivation mirrors the harmony of yin-yang union. When the Sacred Embryo is formed, True Qi is born. Within the Qi, there is Qi—like the Dragon nurturing its pearl.\"*\n\nWhen the Great Elixir is complete, the Yang Spirit emerges, and there is a body beyond the body—like a cicada shedding its husk.\n\nThis internal elixir originates from the union of Dragon and Tiger, transforming into a yellow sprout. When the yellow sprout matures, lead and mercury are refined.\n\n**From *Zhong Lü Transmission of the Dao Collection*, Treatise on Lead and Mercury (10):**\nLü said: *\"The internal elixir does not depart from Dragon and Tiger. The Tiger emerges from the Kan palace—this is the water within Qi. The Dragon emerges from the Li palace—this is the Qi within water. External alchemy takes mercury from sand, likening it to the Yang Dragon. It uses silver from lead, likening it to the Yin Tiger. But if lead and mercury are external elixirs, how does the union of Dragon and Tiger produce the yellow sprout, which then refines into lead and mercury? What is meant by the lead and mercury within the internal elixir?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"The one that embraces the essence of Heavenly Unity and stands as the foremost of the five metals is black lead. Lead generates silver—lead is the mother of silver. Touched by the essence of the Great Yang, it becomes the foremost of all stones—this is cinnabar. Cinnabar generates mercury—mercury is the child of cinnabar. The difficult ones to obtain are silver from lead and mercury from cinnabar. If silver and mercury unite, through refining they naturally become the supreme treasure. This is the external logic of lead and mercury.\n\nBut speaking of internal matters, what is seen in humanity—ancient and modern debates differ greatly. Taking the profound and mysterious account: it originates from the moment of parental union, when essence and blood merge, enclosing True Qi, lodged in the mother’s pure Yin palace, with Spirit hidden before yin-yang differentiation. At three hundred days, the embryo is complete; at five thousand days, the Qi is full.\n\nSpeaking in terms of the Five Phases, the human body is fundamentally essence and blood—water precedes all. Speaking in terms of the Five Organs, essence and blood form the shape, with the kidneys first emerging. Within the kidney water lies concealed the initial parental True Qi of conception. This True Qi is hidden in the inner kidneys—this is what is called lead. The Qi generated by the kidneys, the True Unity water within Qi, is called True Tiger—this is the silver within lead.\n\nKidney Qi passes to Liver Qi, which passes to Heart Qi. Heart Qi, reaching the Great Polarity, generates fluids. Within the fluid is the Pure Yang Qi—this is cinnabar. Mercury is the Pure Yang Qi within the heart fluid. Qi and fluid accumulate into the fetal sac, transmitted within the Yellow Court. Fire is applied without error, and the Embryonic Immortal transforms naturally—this is when lead and silver merge with mercury, refined into treasure.\"\n\nLü said: *\"Among the five metals, silver is taken from lead. Among the eight minerals, mercury is extracted from cinnabar. Placed in the crucible, combined with elixirs, mercury becomes cinnabar and silver becomes treasure. But in humanity, how does one extract silver from lead? How does one extract mercury from cinnabar? How does mercury become cinnabar? How does silver become treasure?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Lead is the original True Qi of parents united into one, pure and inseparable. After forming, it is stored in the kidneys. The two kidneys face each other, ascending together as Qi—this is called Original Yang Qi. Within the Qi is True Unity water. Water ascends with Qi, and where Qi lingers, water lingers; where Qi scatters, water scatters. This water and Qi, like mother and child, never separate. The adept sees only Qi, not water.\n\nIf this True Unity water is united with the Pure Yang Qi of the heart, this is called the union of Dragon and Tiger, transforming into the yellow sprout. The yellow sprout is the Great Elixir—its material is fundamentally True Unity water as the embryo, internally containing Pure Yang Qi, just as the original parental True Qi, with essence and blood forming the fetal sac. Through the processes of transformation, at three hundred days the embryo is complete, Qi is full, and form and Spirit are perfected, separating from the mother.\n\nAfter the outer form unites, union generates form. Those who follow the Dao—when kidney Qi unites with heart Qi, the Qi contains True Unity water bearing Pure Yang Qi, and Qi unites with water to form the fetal sac, resembling millet grains, nurtured without deficiency. Initially, Yin retains Yang; then, Yang refines Yin. Qi transforms into essence, essence into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, and cinnabar into Golden Elixir. When the Golden Elixir is complete, True Qi spontaneously arises, refining Qi into Spirit and achieving transcendence. The Fire Dragon departs from the murky world, riding the Dark Crane into Penglai Isle.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"When form unites with form, form generates form. When Qi unites with Qi, Qi generates Qi—this cycle does not exceed three hundred days. After separation of form, how do the differing shapes of male and female resemble the colors of cinnabar and lead?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"When parental forms unite, the father’s essence enters first, followed by the mother’s blood, with blood enveloping essence to form the female. The female is internally Yang and externally Yin, symbolizing the mother—since blood is external. If the mother’s blood enters first, followed by the father’s essence, with essence enveloping blood to form the male, the male is internally Yin and externally Yang, symbolizing the father—since essence is external.\n\nThis blood originates from the heart and lacks Pure Yang Qi. This essence originates from the kidneys and contains Pure Yang Qi. Pure Yang Qi is the root of mercury—this is the True Unity water merging and entering the Yellow Court. Mercury is boiled with lead’s decoction, and lead is simmered with mercury’s fire. Lead without mercury cannot release True Unity water. Mercury without lead cannot transform into Pure Yang Qi.\"*\n\nWith the Pure Yang Qi refining the lead, the lead generates abundant qi and releases the True Unity water, which can ascend.\n\nYet mercury is inherently Pure Yang Qi—the very True Unity water—serving as the embryo, nurtured within the Yellow Court. This is the union of Dragon and Tiger, where Yin and Yang are balanced. Even when decocted with lead’s broth, it risks excessive Yin, dissipating True Yang. How then could the Great Elixir form, with qi generating from qi?\n\nZhong replied:\n*\"When kidney qi merges with heart qi, extreme qi generates fluid. Within this fluid lies Pure Yang Qi, paired with True Unity water—this is called the union of Dragon and Tiger. Daily, a grain of millet’s worth is obtained, known as the Golden Elixir. It is nurtured within the Yellow Court.\n\nThe Yellow Court lies beneath the spleen and stomach, above the bladder, north of the heart and south of the kidneys, west of the liver and east of the lungs. It is clear above and turbid below, externally corresponding to the four colors, with a capacity of two *sheng*, and pathways connecting to the eight waters. The elixir obtained remains there day and night.\n\nIf one gathers the elixir without applying fire, it will dissipate and cannot be retained. If one applies fire without gathering the elixir, the Yang within Yin cannot be stabilized—it merely stirs the kidney qi, strengthening warmth at the lower *dantian* and nothing more.\n\nIf gathering the elixir is timed and fire is applied methodically, one must first act within the lead, borrowing qi to advance the fire, solidifying the Great Elixir to eternally settle the lower field—this is called the *cǎibǔ* method. Refining mercury to supplement the *dantian* prolongs life and extends years—truly the way of the Earthly Immortal.\n\nIf one gathers the elixir and extracts the raw lead from the elbow’s posterior, golden crystals will fly forth. Once lead is extracted, mercury must be replenished. Without replenishing mercury, one only returns essence to nourish the brain, but how can True Qi arise? If True Qi does not arise, how can the Yang Spirit be perfected?\n\nReplenishing mercury requires extracting lead. Without extracting lead, one merely refines mercury to supplement the *dantian*—how then can the sand transform? If the sand does not transform, how can the Golden Elixir be completed?\"*\n\n—*From the Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao*\n\nOn the Principle of Extraction and Replenishment (Eleventh Discourse)\n\nLü said: *\"The gathering of elixir relies upon the water within the Qi. Advancing the fire requires borrowing the Qi from within the lead. Ultimately, extracting lead yields the Great Elixir. If one then replenishes mercury, it can supplement the Dantian above. What is the meaning of this principle of extraction and replenishment?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"In ancient times, the Most High Sage transmitted the Dao to the mortal realm. The people of the Primeval Age were pure and returned to simplicity, unaware, and thus unable to hear the Great Dao. Heaven and Earth pointed to the proper rise and fall of Yin and Yang, exchanging through the Qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, while seasons followed their appointed rhythms. The cycles of the year were fixed, returning endlessly without deviation from the Dao—this is why Heaven and Earth endure.\n\nThey did not consider that mortals might fail to comprehend, so they revealed the Great Principle, yet it remained obscured in one corner. Next, they spoke of the interplay of the Sun and Moon’s essence, advancing and retreating at dawn, noon, and the waxing and waning phases, appearing and vanishing without error. The months completed their full count, their course unending, never deviating from the Dao—this is why the Sun and Moon endure.\n\nYet when cold gives way to heat and heat to cold, mortals fail to awaken to the proper rise and fall of Heaven and Earth. When the Moon waxes full and then wanes, when it wanes and then waxes full again, mortals do not grasp the interplay of Sun and Moon. They indulge in boundless desires, wasting their finite time.\n\nWealth and luxury adorn the fleeting dream of life, while love and affection bring only endless troubles—ultimately, they repay the debt of mortal existence. The songs have not yet faded when suffering arrives, and when fame and gain are at their height, youth has already departed. Greed for riches and goods leads one to believe that the myriad kalpas will endure, while fondness for children and grandchildren makes them hope for eternal reunion. Yet clinging and delusion never cease, draining the Original Yang and losing True Qi.\n\nThus, they fall ill with dire diseases, only to meet their end when the heart finally rests. When the Great Limit approaches, they realize it is too late. The True Immortals and Most High Sages pity such endless cycles of decline, yet mortals still fall back into decay. They deeply wish for mortals to awaken to the Great Dao, to endure as Heaven and Earth, and as Sun and Moon do.\n\nAt first, they expounded the rise and fall of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang. Then, they illustrated the interplay of the Sun and Moon’s essence. Yet mortals do not perceive the heavenly mechanism or fathom the profound mysteries.\n\nComparing inner elixirs to outer elixirs, and speaking of lifeless things to illustrate the living: lifeless are gold and stone; gold and stone are outer elixirs. The living are Qi and fluids; Qi and fluids are inner elixirs. Great as Heaven and Earth, bright as Sun and Moon, outer as gold and stone, inner as Qi and fluids.\n\nOnce gathered, one must replenish; once replenished, one must extract. The principle of extraction and replenishment is the very root of transformation.\n\nAfter the Winter Solstice, Yang rises from Earth, and Earth extracts its Yin. When the Great Yin is extracted, it becomes the Reclusive Yin; when the Lesser Yang is replenished, it becomes the Bright Yang. If the Reclusive Yin is not extracted, it becomes the Lesser Yin; if the Bright Yang is not replenished, it becomes the Great Yang. Otherwise, there would be no transition from cold to warmth, or from warmth to heat.\n\nAfter the Summer Solstice, Yin descends from Heaven, and Heaven extracts its Yang. When the Great Yang is extracted, it becomes the Bright Yang; when the Lesser Yin is replenished, it becomes the Reclusive Yin. If the Bright Yang is not extracted, it becomes the Lesser Yang; if the Reclusive Yin is not replenished, it becomes the Great Yin. Otherwise, there would be no transition from heat to coolness, or from coolness to cold.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth’s rise and fall of Yin and Yang transform into the Six Qi—this is the proof of extraction and replenishment.\n\nWhen the Moon receives the Sun’s spirit, the Sun’s essence becomes the Moon’s shadow. In the first fifteen days, the Moon extracts its shadow while the Sun replenishes its spirit, so the essence is full and its light shines above and below. Otherwise, there would be no progression from the New Moon to the Upper Crescent, or from the Upper Crescent to the Full Moon.\n\nWhen the Moon returns to its Yin shadow, and the Sun collects its Yang essence, in the latter fifteen days, the Sun extracts its spirit while the Moon replenishes its shadow. The light has already waned, and the Yin shadow is full. Otherwise, there would be no transition from the Full Moon to the Lower Crescent, or from the Lower Crescent to the Dark Moon.\n\nThus, the Sun and Moon’s reciprocal rise and fall transform into the Nine Six phases—this is the proof of extraction and replenishment.\n\nMortals do not perceive the heavenly mechanism or fathom the profound mysteries. The True Immortals and Most High Sages, seeing what mortals love as the cause of illness and death, urge them to refine gold and stone into the Great Elixir. They take what mortals desire—yellow gold and white silver—and use lead and mercury to forge the Supreme Treasure. Their intent is for mortals to awaken to the Great Principle.\n\nThe lifeless gold and stone require no precise fire or timing; extraction and replenishment follow a set count, and yet they can still extend life and years. But if one uses the living essence of one’s own body—the True One’s Yang Qi, the True One’s water—and knows the times of union and the methods of gathering, accumulating day by day and month by month, so that Qi contains Qi, refining Qi into Spirit to attain transcendence, it is indeed a rare and difficult matter in ancient and modern times.\n\nFew in the mortal or celestial realms attain enlightenment. Those who do must cultivate a resolute mind, abandon worldly affairs, and emulate the enduring nature of Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon. They guide the lost and urge them to focus on the Dao, which is why there is the teaching of outer elixirs.\n\nThe sages of past and present have expounded these methods, and their words have reached the world. Yet mortals still fail to awaken, deceiving themselves and others, and thus losing the original intent of the ancient masters.\"\n\nThe alchemists take sand to obtain mercury, and with mercury they stain lead, which then absorbs the mercury. They use mercury to transmute copper, disregarding life and limb in their frenzied pursuit of wealth. Mutual promotion ensues, with the pretense of seeking the Dao, yet truly coveting profit, their ambition fixed on the arts of yellow and white elixirs.\n\nThe ancient sages and transcendent immortals, unable to reveal the truth outright, spoke in parables, teaching through the metaphor of external lead and mercury to hint at inner matters. Even inanimate gold and stone—objects without sentience—can be transformed into treasure through the workings of *造化* (Creation-Transformation). How much more so then for the sentient self, where substances like lead and mercury arise from one’s own essence! If such substances can be refined and transmuted, then why not also produce the divine elixir?\n\nThose who follow the Dao must delve deeply into its mysteries and not cling to the external arts of elixir-forging or the furnaces of alchemy. Indeed, when humans speak of \"external lead\" and \"external mercury,\" they refer to substances extracted from gold and stone, which can be refined into treasure. But the true lead is the primordial *真气* (True Qi) stored within one’s own kidneys—the essence of one’s parents—while the true mercury is the refined essence born from the union of *真一* (True Unity) and *正阳* (Right Yang) *之气* (Qi).\n\nRefining and transmuting this lead and mercury can generate the Spirit. This is what is called *真铅* (True Lead) and *真汞* (True Mercury)—do they too require refining and transmuting? Master Zhōng replied:\n\n\"At first, obtaining mercury requires lead, but using lead is ultimately in error. Thus, one must refine it to enter the Upper Palace, where the Original Qi does not pass through. Then, returning the essence to nourish the brain, one attains daily mercury, with Yin exhausted and Yang pure. The essence transforms into sand, and the sand into gold, which is then called *真铅* (True Lead). True Lead arises from the True Qi within oneself, merging to produce the *真一* (True Unity) and the *正阳* (Right Yang) *之水* (water).\n\nWhen the Five Qi converge at the Original, the Three Yang gather at the Crown, the True Lead ascends to the Inner Treasury and emits a radiant white light. From below to above, from above to below—returning the elixir and refining the form—all are functions of the True Lead’s cyclical movement. From front to back, from back to front—burning the body and uniting the Qi—all are the work of True Qi’s Creation-Transformation.\n\nIf one merely refines without extracting or transmutes without supplementing, remaining content with daily practices, how could one ever gather herbs, stoke the fire, and hope for such miraculous efficacy?\"\n\nMaster Lǚ asked: \"How does one ensure proper extraction and supplementation, so that the ascent and descent are measured, and the front and back remain without discrepancy?\"\n\nMaster Zhōng replied: \"At the time when it can be ascended, it must not be descended; when it can be extracted, it must not be supplemented. The movements of ascent and descent must be without the slightest error—this is the power of the *河车* (River Vehicle).\" The Dao was transmitted between Zhōng and Lǚ.\n\n**Discourse on the River Vehicle (Chapter Twelve)**\n\nMaster Lǚ asked: *\"What is meant by the 'River Vehicle'?\"*\n\nMaster Zhōng replied: *\"In ancient times, a wise man observed how floating clouds could block the sun and provide shade, and thus conceived the idea of a roof. He saw fallen leaves drifting on the water and thought of crafting a boat to carry things. Observing how dandelion seeds (piāopéng) drift with the wind, turning endlessly without rest, he then fashioned a chariot. Now, a chariot—its axle represents the heavens and earth, its revolving wheels mirror the sun and moon. High Daoists drew their analogy from chariots, for chariots move upon the earth and turn upon land. But the River Vehicle has its own explanation: within the human body, Yang is scarce while Yin is abundant, and water is prevalent. The chariot symbolizes transport, while the river embodies the abundance of Yin. Thus, this River Vehicle does not move upon the earth but upon the waters. From above to below, sometimes forward, sometimes backward, it carries its load within the Eight Precious (jīn) and traverses the Four Seas. Ascending to the heavens, it enters Kunlun; having crossed, it descends to the Phoenix Gate. It transports the Primordial Yang straight into the Palace of Separation (Lí Gōng); it conveys True Qi and returns it to the Hall of Longevity. It travels through the Nine Regions without pause; it circulates the Three Mountains without rest. When the Dragon and Tiger unite, it commands the Yellow Woman to enter the Yellow Court; when Lead and Mercury are divided, it entrusts the Golden Boy to carry them to the Golden Gate. The Thousand Springs of Jade flow, yet their movement halts in half a moment’s work; the Golden Elixir is transported in but a fleeting instant. Without this Vehicle to transport the Five Phases, they could never coalesce into a unified Qi. Without this Vehicle, how could they unite? To act in accordance with the seasons and times, one must rely on this Vehicle to transport them—only then will there be efficacy. The cultivation of Yang and the refining of Yin must depend on this Vehicle to transport them, only then will there be no discrepancy. Before Heaven and Earth are perfected, the Vehicle circulates their pure Qi, drawing in the Primordial Yang of the Original Palace. From the mundane to the sage, it transports the true and genuine Qi of Yin and Yang, refining and supplementing the Original Spirit of the body—its merits cannot be fully enumerated.\"*\n\nMaster Lǚ asked: *\"The River Vehicle possesses such wondrous functions. May I inquire: what within the human body constitutes this Vehicle? Once obtained, how is it employed?\"*\n\nMaster Zhōng replied: *\"The River Vehicle originates from the true water of the Northern Pole, where the kidneys store the true Qi. The true Qi’s generated essence—this is called the River Vehicle.\n\nThe functions of the River Vehicle are rarely heard of in both ancient and modern times; it is a secret kept by the true immortals. Just as the Original Yang (乾) seeks the Original Yin (坤) to produce the Water Trigram (坎)—Water being the essence of Yin—when the Yang has sought the Yin, it returns, carrying the Yin back to its place, passing through the Earth (艮), Thunder (震), and Wind (巽) trigrams. By seeking the Yin with the Yang, and through the Yin extracting the Yin, it transports the essence into the Fire Trigram (離), where the Yang is received and generates life. This is the River Vehicle transporting Yin into the Yang Palace (陽宮).\n\nAnd when the Original Yin (坤) seeks the Original Yang (乾) to produce the Fire Trigram (離)—Fire being the essence of Yang—once the Yin has sought the Yang, it returns, embracing the Yang and restoring its place, passing through the Earth (艮), Lake (兌), and Heaven (乾) trigrams. By seeking the Yang with the Yin, and through the Yin extracting the Yang, it transports the essence into the Water Trigram (坎), where the Yin is received and generates life. This is the River Vehicle transporting Yang into the Yin Palace (陰官).\n\nFurthermore, when gathering medicinal herbs from the Nine Palaces (九宮), one obtains them and descends into the Yellow Court (黃庭). When extracting lead from beneath the Crooked River (曲江), one transports it upward into the Inner Palace (內院). The Jade Elixir (玉液) and Gold Elixir (金液) are the Original Elixir (還丹); their transportation can refine the form and enable the water to ascend. The Sovereign’s Fire (君火) and the Common Fire (民火) are used for refining the form; their transportation can burn the elixir and cause the fire to descend.\n\nThe Five Qi (五氣) return to their source, each with its appointed time for transportation. The Three Flowers (三花) gather at the crown, each with its specific day for transportation. When the Spirit (神) gathers, demons arise; if one transports the true fire to consume the body, the Three Corpses (三尸) vanish. When the medicinal elixir is complete, the seas run dry; if one transports the dewy nectar (霞浆) to bathe in it, one enters the water without disturbance.\n\nThese are the functions of the River Vehicle.\"*\n\nLü said, *\"The River Vehicle is the original qi of the North, turning endlessly and boundlessly. It bears yin and yang, each achieving its own fulfillment, yet the methods employed are not uniform. Revered Master, you must explain this in detail.\"*\n\nZhong said, *\"The Five Phases cycle endlessly, returning to their beginning. In silent accord with inverted techniques, when the Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout—this is the Small River Vehicle. When the Elbow-Post Flying Gold Crystal ascends and the crystal returns to the Cinnabar Field, when lead is extracted and mercury added to form the Great Medicine—this is the Great River Vehicle. The Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout; lead and mercury unite to form the Great Medicine.\n\nWhen true qi arises, the Five Qi return to the Central Primordial Yang; when the Three Spirits gather, they transcend the Inner Palace. When the Purple-Gold Elixir is complete, it remains like the Dark Cranes flying in pairs; when the White Jade Mercury is refined, it surges like the Fire Dragon rising. Golden radiance in ten thousand streams envelops the vulgar bones with brilliance; a single Qí-tree blooms with fresh blossoms, dazzling in splendor.\n\nSometimes it emerges, sometimes it enters—each emergence and entry amplifies itself; sometimes it departs, sometimes it returns—its comings and goings are unobstructed. When the Spirit is transported into the body and mingles with the flowing times, it transforms the Sage, separating from the mundane, becoming a Feathered Immortal. Thus it is called the Purple River Vehicle.\n\nThese are the names of the Three Vehicles, divided into upper, middle, and lower realms. Hence, they are called Three Realizations—not like the Buddhist Three Vehicles: the Sheep Vehicle, the Deer Vehicle, and the Great Ox Vehicle.\n\nSpeaking in terms of the Dao, after the River Vehicle, there are three more: those who gather fire and direct their mind and intention to assault illnesses are called the Messenger Vehicle. Those who have already achieved harmony, descending from above, with yin and yang perfectly aligned, where water and fire coexist, and within stillness, the sound of thunder resounds—these are the Thunder Vehicles. If the mind is enslaved by external things, if emotions are dragged by external forces, and one is scattered by external influences, depleting the true yang qi from without to within, without rest, until qi weakens and the body becomes emaciated, leading to decay and old age—then, if one contracts the Five Epidemics and struggles to transport true qi, the Primordial Yang cannot withstand it, and one dies old and sick—this is called the Broken Vehicle.\"*\n\nLü said, *\"When the Five Phases invert and the Dragon and Tiger unite, the Small River Vehicle is already in motion. When the Three Fields return and the Elbow-Post Flying Gold Crystal ascends, the Great River Vehicle is about to move. But when will the Purple River Vehicle be set in motion?\"*\n\nZhōng said, *\"Those who cultivate the True Dao—having heard the Great Way, encountered a wise Teacher, and understood the principles of Heaven and Earth ascending and descending, the cycles of the sun and moon—first match yin and yang, then gather and scatter water and fire. Then, they gather medicinal herbs and advance the fire, add mercury and extract lead, and thus the Small River Vehicle shall be in motion.\n\nWhen the Elbow-Post Flying Gold Crystal enters the crown, and the Great Elixir of the Yellow Court gradually forms, striking the Three Passes in one blow, directly ascending to the Inner Palace, rising behind and gathering before, refining above and nourishing below, then the Great River Vehicle shall indeed be in motion. Only then, when the Golden Elixir and Jade Elixir return to the Primordial Elixir, can one begin to refine the form. Refining the form leads to refining the qi, refining the qi leads to refining the spirit, and refining the spirit to unite with the Dao—only then does one say the Dao is complete.\n\nTo emerge from the mundane and enter the transcendent, this is called the Purple River Vehicle.\"*\n\nZhōng-Lǚ’s Transmission of the Dao: *On the Primordial Elixir (13th)*\n\nLǚ said, *\"Refining the form to achieve the qi, refining the qi to achieve the spirit, refining the spirit to unite with the Dao—I dare not claim to have heard such commandments. What is meant by the Primordial Elixir?\"*\n\nZhōng said, *\"What is meant by 'Dan' is not its color—red or yellow cannot be used to attain it. What is meant by 'Dan' is not that—sweetness and harmony cannot be combined to form it. 'Dan' refers to the Dan Field. The Dan Field has three: the Upper Field of Divine Assembly, the Middle Field of Qi Palace, and the Lower Field of Vital Essence.\n\nWithin the Vital Essence, Qi is born; within the Qi, the Primordial Essence resides. Within the Qi, Spirit is born; within the Spirit, the Primordial Essence of the Upper Field resides. True Water and True Qi combine to form the Vital Essence; within the Vital Essence, the Primordial Essence of the Lower Field resides. Those who follow the Dao all possess these three Dan Fields. Yet, the Qi is dominated by the Kidneys and has not yet ascended to the Middle Field; the Spirit is housed within the Heart and has not yet transcended to the Upper Field. If the Vital Essence cannot return and merge, though the three Dan Fields exist, their function remains useless.\"*\n\nLǚ said, *\"Within the Mysterious lies the Mysterious—every person inherently possesses this Vital Essence. But if there is no Vital Essence within the Vital Essence, it is not my own Qi, but rather the Primordial Yang of my parents. Without Vital Essence, there is no Qi; without Qi, it is not my own Spirit, but the Primordial Spirit of my parents. The Vital Essence, Qi, and Spirit are the treasures of the three Dan Fields—how can they be acquired and perpetually reside in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Palaces?\"*\n\nZhōng said, *\"Within the Kidneys, Qi is born; within the Qi, the True One’s Water resides. If one makes the Water return to the Lower Dan Field, then the Vital Essence nourishes the Soul Root, and the Qi shall naturally be generated. Within the Heart, liquid is born; within the liquid, the Rectified Yang’s Qi resides. If one makes the Qi return to the Middle Dan Field, then the Qi nourishes the Soul Source, and the Spirit shall naturally be generated. Gathering the Souls to form the Spirit, merging the Spirit into the Dao, and returning it to the Upper Dan Field—only then can one transcend.\"*\n\nLǚ said, *\"The Dan Field has Upper, Middle, and Lower aspects; the term 'returning' implies movement with a destination. The principle of returning to the Primordial Elixir is profound and subtle—I dare to speak and explain it in detail.\"*\n\nZhōng said, *\"There is Small Returning to the Primordial Elixir, Great Returning to the Primordial Elixir, Seven Circulations Returning to the Primordial Elixir, Nine Transformations Returning to the Primordial Elixir, Complete Liquid Returning to the Primordial Elixir, Jade Liquid Returning to the Primordial Elixir, Returning the Lower to the Upper Dan Field, Returning the Upper to the Middle Dan Field, Returning the Middle to the Lower Dan Field, Returning Yang to Yin Dan Field, and Returning Yin to Yang Dan Field. The differences are not merely in names, but also in timing and the methods of execution.\"*\n\nLǚ said, *\"What is meant by Small Returning to the Primordial Elixir?\"*\n\nZhōng said, *\"Small Returning to the Primordial Elixir originates from the Lower Primordial Field. The Lower Primordial Field is the master of the five Zang Organs and the root of the three Dan Fields. It follows the cycle: Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water. When they generate one another, if the timing is not precise, the unborn is drawn to birth as in the love between a child and parent. When they conquer one another—Fire conquers Metal, Metal conquers Wood, Wood conquers Earth, Earth conquers Water, and Water conquers Fire—if the balance is not maintained, the unconquered is supplemented as in the union of husband and wife. The Qi and liquid circulate and transform; from Child to Noon, Yin and Yang generate; from Morning to Evening, Yin and Yang cease. For every day and night, if the Qi returns to the Lower Dan Field and completes one cycle, it is called Small Returning to the Primordial Elixir. Those who follow the Dao gather the medicine within this process, directing the Fire to face the Lower Dan Field—this is indeed its source.\"*\n\n「Zhōng yuē: *\"Lóng hǔ xiāng jiāo ér biàn huáng yá, chōu qiān tiān gǒng ér chéng dà yào.

Spirit is the master of form; form is the dwelling of spirit. Within form, essence generates qi, and qi generates spirit. Within the fluids, qi is born; within qi, fluids are born—this is the child-mother relationship of form.\n\nWater generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, and metal generates water. Qi flows in the child-mother cycle while fluids move in the husband-wife cycle—this is the yin-yang of form. Water transforms into fluids, fluids into blood, and blood into vital essence (jīn), by which yin obtains yang and life is produced. If yin and yang are misaligned, then tears, mucus, saliva, and sweat overflow, and yin loses its capacity to generate.\n\nQi transforms into essence, essence into pearls, pearls into mercury, and mercury into sand—by which yang obtains yin and completion is achieved. If yin and yang are misaligned, then illness, aging, death, and suffering arise, and yang cannot attain fulfillment.\n\nYin without yang does not generate; yang without yin does not complete. Those who follow the Dao cultivate yang but not yin, refine themselves but not external things. At the moment of birth, when the breath first enters, the true qi of one’s parents is divided and lodges within the embryo, nurtured in the mother’s purely yin palace. Within yin, yin is generated; through form, form is created. When the fetus is complete and the breath is full, the six-foot frame is entirely yin, with only a trace of primordial yang.\n\nTo seek eternal life and not die, one must cultivate the form to remain in the world across countless kalpas. To transcend the mundane and attain sainthood, one must cultivate the form to transform qi, thereby gaining an additional body beyond the physical.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The form is yin, and yin has substance. To make the substantial insubstantial—to transform the form into qi and thus abandon the mundane body to enter the ranks of the sages—this is the highest method of cultivation. To retain qi within the form and use qi to nourish the form: in small measure, it brings comfort and longevity; in great measure, it still allows one to dwell in the world. For the aged, it reverses decay and restores youth; for the young, it preserves complexion and extends life. Taking thirty-six thousand years as one age, two hundred sixty thousand ages as one kalpa, and three hundred sixty thousand kalpas as one great kalpa—within such vast kalpas, time is unknown, yet one endures alongside heaven and earth. But if these principles of cultivation and the mechanisms of transformation yield such results, may I hear them explained?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"When the form is complete, the fetus is formed in three hundred days. After birth, the breath is full in five thousand days. The five-foot-five-inch stature corresponds to the five phases of creation. Some may vary in size, but proportions are measured by the inch—length and breadth must align appropriately.\n\nAbove the heart lies the Nine Heavens; below the heart lies the Nine Earths. From the kidneys to the heart is eight inches and four divisions. From the heart to the first ring of the *chónglóu* (double pavilion) is eight inches and four divisions. From the first ring of the *chónglóu* to the crown is eight inches and four divisions. Thus, from the kidneys to the crown, it totals two feet, five inches, and two divisions. The primordial qi fills this space in a day and night, completing a full cycle of three hundred twenty degrees. Each degree measures two feet, five inches, and two divisions, totaling eighty-one zhang (丈). The primordial qi aligns with the ninefold, ninefold celestial yang, while the distance between the kidneys and heart harmonizes with the natural separation of heaven and earth.\n\nFrom the kidneys to the crown, the span is two feet, five inches. Additionally, according to the fivefold, fivefold pure yang of the Five Phases, the primordial qi emerges with each inhalation. Once released, the *róng* (nutritive) and *wèi* (defensive) circulate freely, drawing the true qi of heaven and earth. They respond to the seasons, sometimes merging, sometimes diverging, endlessly measuring zhang and chǐ. With each exhalation, the qi returns. Upon entering, the meridians and collaterals open. One inhalation and exhalation—this is the true qi of heaven, earth, and humanity coursing through the twelve rings (of the *chónglóu*). Its ebb and flow are called one breath. In a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths: thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations, drawing one’s own primordial qi from within; thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations, drawing the true qi of heaven and earth from without.\n\nIf the roots are firm and the primordial qi undiminished, then during each breath, one can seize the true qi of heaven and earth. By refining qi with qi, it permeates the Four Great Elements (四大). The pure nourishes the *róng*, while the turbid nourishes the *wèi*, all flowing freely. The vertical courses through the meridians, the horizontal through the collaterals, all expanding without obstruction. Cold and heat cannot harm, labor and toil cannot threaten—light body, strong bones, clear qi, and tranquil spirit. One eternally preserves boundless life and becomes a perpetually youthful being.\n\nBut if the roots are not firm, the essence exhausted, and the qi weak, then above, the breath has already been dissipated, and below, the original palace lacks replenishment. The drawn qi of heaven and earth surges out, while eighty-one zhang of primordial qi are depleted in the ninefold cycle. Instead of becoming one’s own, it is taken by heaven and earth—how could such a one seize the true qi of heaven and earth? When yin accumulates and yang declines, the qi weakens and disease arises; when the qi is exhausted, death follows, and one falls into the wheel of rebirth.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"How does one prevent the primordial qi from dispersing, so that through cultivating the form, one may seize the true qi of heaven and earth and endure through the great kalpas?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"To conquer, one must first strengthen one’s forces.\"*\n\nTo ensure the people dwell in peace, it lies in the wealth of the realm.\nWhat is called *bīng* (兵) is the primordial *qi*.\nWhen *bīng* is within, it consumes the form’s yin;\nWhen *bīng* is without, it seizes the *qi* of heaven and earth.\n\nWhat is called *guó* (国) is the body itself.\nThe body’s manifest aspect—abundant and ever in surplus;\nThe body’s formless aspect—unyielding and never wanting.\nTen thousand households flourish without fear of loss,\nA single horse straying brings manifold gains.\nNow advance, now retreat—thus refining the substance and burning the form.\nNow ascend, now descend—thus nourishing yang and dissipating yin.\n\nThe furnace of heaven and earth has its appointed time,\nYet when does the tempering of *qi* and essence lack its day?\nWith *yùyè* (玉液) refining the form, riding the *jiālóng* (甲龙) to take flight,\nWhite frost settles upon the dusty flesh.\nWith *jīnyè* (金液) refining the form, chasing the *léichē* (雷车) to descend,\nGolden radiance fills the chamber.\n\nLü said: *\"The principles of refining the form, I grasp in broad strokes.\nWhat are *jīnyè* and *yùyè*?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"When essence refines the form, the bones turn golden, and the body emits golden light.\nGolden blossoms appear in fragments, manifesting in the void—\nThis is when the Five *Qi* return to the Primordial, the Three Yangs gather at the crown,\nThe moment of transcending the mortal frame, the day the Golden Elixir is complete.\n\nIf *yùyè* refines the form, the flesh radiates yang richness,\nThe body becomes like *qítree* (琪树), *qiónghuā* (琼花), *yùzǎo* (玉藻).\nThe mortal frame is transformed, its luster dazzling others,\nRiding the wind, soaring effortlessly—\nThe form is becoming *qi*.\n\nThose who follow the Dao, though they know the method of returning the elixir,\nYet the work of refining the form is no small matter.\nWhen *yùyè* returns as the elixir, bathing in the embryonic immortal,\nAscending upward, transporting the *hèchē* (河车) through the Four Great [elements].\nIt begins with the liver—\nThe liver receives it, and light fills the eyes, like polished lacquer.\nNext, the heart—\nThe heart receives it, and sacred essence flows from the mouth, like white snow.\nNext, the spleen—\nThe spleen receives it, and the flesh becomes congealed fat, all scars vanish.\nNext, the lungs—\nThe lungs receive it, and the nose perceives celestial fragrance, the face regains its youth.\nFinally, the kidneys—\nThe kidneys receive it, and the elixir returns to its original palace.\nThe ears constantly hear the music of strings and pipes,\nThe temples forever free of white hairs.\n\nThis is the refining of the form with *yùyè*.\nYet the refining of the form with *jīnyè* cannot compare.\n\nAt first, the elixir returns but does not fully return,\nMeeting with the sovereign fire, it is called *Jìjí* (既济).\nWhen the elixir fully returns and arises anew,\nConfronting true yin and yang, it is called refining the substance.\nEarth inherently overcomes water—\nIf *jīnyè* dwells in earth, it makes the Yellow Emperor’s light return,\nMerging with the Great Yin.\nFire inherently overcomes metal—\nIf *jīnyè* dwells in fire, it makes the Vermilion Child share the furnace,\nBorn from the purple *qi*.\n\nRaising fire within water, dissolving yin within yang.\nTransforming the Golden Elixir within the Yellow Court,\nRefining the yang spirit amid the Five *Qi*.\nIn the liver, green *qi* surges;\nIn the lungs, white *qi* emerges;\nIn the heart, red light appears;\nIn the kidneys, black *qi* ascends;\nIn the spleen, yellow hue arises.\n\nThe Five *Qi* return to the Central Primordial,\nAdvancing with the sovereign fire to surpass the Inner Precinct.\nThe lower yin’s yang—its yang without yin—ascends and gathers in the Spirit Palace.\nThe central yang’s yang—its yang without birth—ascends and gathers in the Spirit Palace.\nThe Yellow Court’s great medicine—yin exhausted, pure yang—\nGathers and ascends in the Spirit Palace.\nThe Five Essences return to the Lower Primordial,\nThe Five *Qi* precede the Central Primordial,\nThe Three Yangs return to the Upper Primordial.\n\nWhen the Primordial Return is complete, the work reaches three thousand [cycles],\nNow the crane dances atop the crown, now the dragon soars within the body.\nOnly the resonant music of the celestial is heard,\nAnd the sight of falling immortal flowers—\nThe Purple Court lingers, the true fragrance perfumes the air.\nWhen the three thousand [cycles] are complete, one is no longer of the dusty world;\nWhen a single incense stick burns away, one has already become a guest of *Pénglái* (蓬瀛),\nThus it is said: transcending the mortal to enter the sacred, shedding the form to ascend as immortal.\"*\n\n**Discourse on the Primordial Return (Chapter Fifteen)**\n\n**Lü** said: *\"The Dao of refining the form—\nits principles are already known.\nBut what of the so-called Primordial Return?\nMay it be spoken of?\"*\n\n**Zhōng** replied: *\"When the Great Elixir is nearly ready,\nthe Jade Essence returns to the Dan and bathes in the Embryonic Dao of the Immortal.\nOnce the True Qi has been born,\nit ascends to purge the Jade Essence,\ntransforming the mortal bones and ascending to the Spirit Palace—\nthis is called the Jade Essence Refining the Form.\n\nThen, when the golden essence rises from the elbow and the Golden Spark ascends,\nthe River Vehicle enters the Inner Court,\ndescending from above to the middle, then from the middle to the lower.\nThe Golden Elixir returns to the Dan to refine the Golden Sand,\nwhile the Five Qi pay homage to the Primordial,\nand the Three Yangs gather at the crown—\nthus the refining of Qi into Spirit,\nnot merely refining the form to dwell in the world.\n\nThe Primordial Return is a secret known to few in ancient and modern times.\nIf one were to know it,\nthe sages and worthies would not speak of it.\nFor it is the method of the True Immortals in their ultimate attainment,\nconcealed in the unfathomable mysteries of Heaven and Earth,\na matter of the Three Emotions' deepest secrecy,\na profound intent beyond words and symbols,\na wondrous principle beyond question and response.\n\nI fear your resolve is not steadfast and your studies are not single-minded,\nyour heart is not settled and your inquiry is not sincere.\nLight words and easy speech\nwould only add to my offense of leaking sacred Dao,\nand prove fruitless for all.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Now I grasp the True Dao of the Immortals and perceive the Great Way.\nNext, I understand the seasons and penetrate the mysteries of Heaven.\nI discern the true essence of Water and Fire,\nknowing that the Dragon and Tiger do not arise from the liver and lungs.\nI examine the principles of extraction and addition,\nand verify that lead and mercury are not the same as the trigrams **Kàn** (☵) and **Lí** (☲).\nThe calculations of the Five Phases in reverse are already revealed to me,\nand the mechanics of the Three Fields' return are now laid bare.\nI am thoroughly familiar with the logic of refining the form with Elixir,\nand deeply comprehend the art of eternal longevity.\n\nYet the origin of transcending the mundane to become a Sage,\nthe Dao of shedding the physical to ascend as an Immortal,\nrests upon refining the Qi and attaining the **Primordial Return** (Cháo Yuán).\nAs for the **Primordial Return**, I dare to impart its essential instructions.\"*\n\n Zhōng said: *\"The Dao is formless by nature,\nbut **Tàiyuān** (太原) demonstrates simplicity.\nAbove, it is pure; below, it is turbid,\nyet it contains both as one.\nWhen **Tàijí** (太极) divides,\n**Hùndùn** (混沌) first separates to form Heaven and Earth,\nand within Heaven and Earth, the Five Directions—east, west, south, north, and center—are arrayed.\nEach Direction has its own Sovereign,\neach Sovereign has two children:\none is Yang, the other is Yin.\nThus, the two **Qi** (vital energies) generate and complete each other,\nforming the Five Phases.\nThe Five Phases generate and complete each other,\nestablishing the Six Qi.\nHence, the Three Yin and Three Yang arise.\nFrom this, one may infer:\nAt the very beginning of conception,\nthe vital essence is undivided as one.\nOnce the essence differentiates,\nthe two kidneys first emerge.\nThe left kidney, associated with **Xuán** (玄, \"mysterious\"),\nascends the Qi and transmits it upward to the liver.\nThe right kidney, associated with **Pìn** (牝, \"feminine\"),\nreceives the fluids and transmits them downward to the bladder.\n**Xuán** and **Pìn** originate from the **void within** (無中),\ntransforming the **non-existent into the existent** (以無為有).\nThis is the true essence of the parents.\nWhen it is received in the realm of pure Yin,\nit is called the **Spirit of the Valley** (谷神不死),\nthe **Gate of Mysterious Feminine** (玄牝之門),\ncomparable to the **Root of Heaven and Earth** (天地之根).\n**Xuán** and **Pìn** are the two kidneys,\nfrom which the five Zàng (solid) organs and six Fǔ (hollow) organs all derive.\nWithin them:\nThe liver, as wood, is **Jiǎ-Yǐ** (甲乙),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the East, Qīngdì** (青帝).\nThe heart, as fire, is **Bǐng-Dīng** (丙丁),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the South, Chìdì** (赤帝).\nThe lungs, as metal, are **Gēng-Xīn** (庚辛),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the West, Báidì** (白帝).\nThe spleen, as earth, is **Wù-Jǐ** (戊己),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the Center, Huángdì** (黃帝).\nThe kidneys, as water, are **Rén-Gǔi** (壬癸),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the North, Hēidì** (黑帝).\nAt birth, humans lack form,\nexisting merely as one Yin and one Yang.\nOnce the embryo is complete,\nthe intestines and stomach form,\nand the Six Qi are divided—three male, three female.\nOne Qi governs the Five Phases,\nthe Five Phases govern the Six Qi.\nFirst, one must recognize Yin and Yang,\nwhereby Yang contains **Yin-within-Yang** (阴中阳),\nand Yin contains **Yang-within-Yin** (陽中陰).\nNext, one must recognize the Five Phases—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—\nand their transformations:\nwater containing fire, fire containing water,\nwater containing metal, metal containing wood,\nwood containing fire, fire containing earth.\nThese five mutually interact,\nthus dividing the two Qi into Six Qi,\nand scattering the Great Dao into the Five Phases.\n\nFor example, after the **Winter Solstice** (冬至),\none Yang arises in the Five Directions,\nand all Yang energies ascend.\nOne Sovereign issues the command,\nwhile the other four assist.\nIf, during the spring season,\nthe **Sovereign of the North, Hēidì** (黑帝) fails to withdraw his command,\nthen cold cannot transform into warmth.\nIf the **Sovereign of the South, Chìdì** (赤帝) does not uphold his command,\nthen warmth cannot transform into heat.\nAfter the **Summer Solstice** (夏至),\none Yin arises in the Five Directions of Heaven,\nand all Yin energies descend.\nOne Sovereign issues the decree,\nwhile the other four assist.\nIf, during the autumn season,\nthe **Sovereign of the South, Chìdì** (赤帝) fails to withdraw his decree,\nthen heat cannot transform into coolness.\nIf the **Sovereign of the North, Hēidì** (黑帝) does not uphold his decree,\nthen coolness cannot transform into cold.\n\nAt the **Winter Solstice**, Yang arises from the earth\nand ascends to greet the Qi of Heaven and Earth.\nAt the **Summer Solstice**, Yin arises from Heaven\nand descends to greet the Qi of Heaven and Earth.\nThose who follow the Dao\nshould deeply investigate these principles.\n\nBetween the sun and moon,\nwhen one Yang first arises,\nthe Qi of the five Zàng organs ascend to greet the **Central Primordial** (中元).\nWhen one Yin first arises,\nthe fluids of the five Zàng organs descend to greet the **Lower Primordial** (下元).\nThe **Yin-within-Yang** (阴中之阳),\nthe **Yang-within-Yang** (阳中之阳),\nand the **Yang-within-Yin-and-Yang** (阴阳中之阳)\nascend to greet the **Upper Primordial** (上元),\nwhile the **Spirit of the Heart** (心神) returns to the **Celestial Palace** (天宫).\nThese are all acts of the **Primordial Return**.\"*\n\n Lü said: *\"When Yang arises,\nthe Five Qi ascend to greet the **Central Primordial** (中元).\nWhen Yin arises,\nthe Five Fluids descend to

Primordial** (下元),\nthis too is what all humans do.\nIf one only practices thus,\nthey cannot transcend the mundane.\nYet to **transcend the mundane and become a Sage** (超凡入圣),\nto **shed the physical

strong while the liver is weak;\nin winter, the kidneys are strong while the heart is weak.\nHumans rely on the kidneys as their foundation.\nAt each seasonal transition,\nthe spleen is strong while the kidneys are weak,\nand only the kidneys suffer damage across the four seasons.\nMost illnesses stem from this.\nIn spring, when **Jiǎ-Yǐ** (甲乙) governs the liver,\none must guard against the

falters,\none **Zàng** (脏) is strong while another decays.\nMost illnesses stem from this.\n\nFor the heart’s **Qi**,\nit sprouts at **Hài** (亥) and grows at **Yín** (寅),\npeaks at **Sì** (巳) and

**Yín** (寅).\nThe spleen’s **Qi** in spring follows the liver,\nin summer follows the heart,\nin autumn follows the lungs,\nand in winter follows the kidneys.\nThose who fail to observe the daily rhythms,\nunaware of the times when **Qi** sprouts, peaks, or weakens,\noften fall ill from this ignorance.\n\nIf on a day, month, or hour when the **three Yang** (三阳) have gathered,\none must cultivate the Yang and prevent the **Yin** from arising.\nIf on a day, month, or hour when the **three Yin** (三阴) have gathered,\none must nourish the Yang and prevent it from dispersing.\n\nMoreover, when pure **Yang Qi** (纯阳之气) ceaselessly refines the **Qi** of the five **Zàng** (五脏),\nit reveals their true essence,\nand in one motion reaches the **Celestial Pool** (天池).\n\nFirst, the kidneys

merge in one furnace.\nNext, the spleen has no **Yin**—\nthe **Jade Gate** (玉户) does not open.\nFinally, the **True Qi** (真气) ascends,\nthe four **Qi**s unite as one.\n\nEven if **Golden Elixir** (金液) descends,\na cup of water cannot quench the blazing fire of the **Cartload of Fuel** (舆薪之火).\nWater and Fire embrace and merge as one,\nentering the **Divine Palace** (神宫),\nwhere stillness and inner

**silencing their hearts** (冥心),\nenter the **domain of the mysterious and elusive** (希夷之域).\nIt is because through **inner observation** (内观),\nthe **Spirit** (神) and **Mind** (识) naturally settle.\"*\n\n「On Inner Observation (the Sixteenth Treatise) — Lü said: *\"Can the principles of **inner observation** (内观) be heard and learned?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"The **methods** (法) of **inner observation** (内观), **sitting in forgetfulness** (坐忘), and **retaining visualization** (存想) have some who embrace them and others who dare not. They fear the **heart-monkey** (心猿) and **mind-horse** (意马), ever restless and unanchored. They dread that through attachment to external things, their resolve may be lost, and that they lack a **central stabilizing form** (中立象). Thus, they strive to make the ears not hear and the eyes not see, the heart not wander and the mind not stray. Yet, **retaining visualization** (存想) and **inner observation** (内观) cannot be entirely abandoned—how can one of little learning and no wisdom know the proper time for **copulation** (交合) or grasp the **methods of cultivation** (行持之法)? They merely hope for success through **retaining visualization** (存想), imagining **elixir within the body** (意内成丹) or **extracting medicine from thought** (想中取药). They draw in through the nose and swallow through the mouth, fixating on the tangible **sun and moon** (日月), the **formless heavens and earth** (无为之天地), and attempt to retain them in the abdomen—this is but child’s play! Hence, the **adepts of the Dao** (达士) and **mysterious ones** (奇人), once they discard **sitting in forgetfulness** (坐忘) and **retaining visualization** (存想), are left with nothing but **dreams of wealth** (梦里得财)—how could this suffice?\n\nTo **draw a cake on the ground** (画地为饼) is no remedy for hunger. To **grasp at emptiness within emptiness** (空中又空), like **mirror reflections and watery moons** (如镜花水月), will never yield true substance. Yet there are still aspects worth embracing: those easily moved are but fragments of the heart, those hard to subdue are but single threads of the mind. On favorable days and auspicious times, these may be gathered and refined. Though one knows the **purity of the Dao** (清净之地), the heart is enslaved by worldly affairs, and the resolve is swayed by fleeting emotions. Time passes like **flashes of lightning** (比电光), and every moment is precious—yet the slightest deviation in method leaves one as distant from the Dao as the **heavens from the earth** (天地悬隔). Years and months accumulate, yet no progress is made—this failure stems from a **turbulent heart and frenzied mind** (心乱而意狂).\n\nThose who **fix their gaze well** (善视者) may covet the beauty of **lapis lazuli and cinnabar** (丹青), yet miss the **Great Peak** (泰华). Those who **listen keenly** (善听者) may seek the **true resonance of strings and bamboo** (丝竹真音), yet fail to hear the **thunderous might** (雷霆). Even the senses, so limited in scope, are thus misled—how much more so the **heart-mind**, vast as the **six directions of space** (六合), encompassing all yet never fully grasped! At the critical juncture of **seizing the time and applying the method** (得时用法), how could one not rely on **retaining visualization** (存想) and **inner observation** (内观) to attain it?\"\n\nLü said: *\"What are the general outlines of **retaining visualization** (存想) and **inner observation** (内观)?\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"When the **Yang ascends** (阳升), one often visualizes as: **man** (男), **dragon** (龙), **fire** (火), **heaven** (天), **clouds** (云), **crane** (鹤), **sun** (日), **horse** (马), **smoke** (烟), **mist** (霞), **chariot** (车), **horses and carriage** (驾), **flower** (花), **qi** (气). All such visualizations are **inner observation** (内观) and **retaining visualization** (存想), thus corresponding to the **symbol of Yang’s ascent** (阳升之象).\n\nWhen the **Yin descends** (阴降), one often visualizes as: **woman** (女), **tiger** (虎), **water** (水), **earth** (地), **rain** (雨), **tortoise** (龟), **moon** (月), **ox** (牛), **spring** (泉), **mud** (泥), **boat** (船), **leaves** (叶). All such visualizations are **inner observation** (内观) and **retaining visualization** (存想), thus corresponding to the **symbol of Yin’s descent** (阴降之象).\n\nThe **Azure Dragon** (青龙), **White Tiger** (白虎), **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀), and **Dark Tortoise** (玄武)—since they bear these names, their forms must be retained. The **Five Sacred Mountains** (五岳), **Nine Regions** (九州), **Four Seas** (四海), **Three Isles** (三岛), **Golden Man** (金男), **Jade Woman** (玉女), **River Chariot** (河车), and **Double Layered Pavilion** (重楼)—to call upon their names and likenesses is beyond full description. All rely on establishing a **central stabilizing form** (无中立象) to settle the **Spirit** (神) and **Mind** (识).\n\nBefore catching the fish, one must not lose the **fish-trap** (筌); before snaring the hare, one must not abandon the **hare’s foot** (蹄). When the **later chariot moves** (后车), it must follow the **tracks of the earlier chariot** (前车之迹). When the **great vessel is formed** (大器), it must serve as the **model for later vessels** (后器之模). Thus, the **methods of inner observation** (内观之法) and **cultivation** (行持) cannot be neglected.\n\nYet one must not cling to them for **eternity** (悠久), nor discard them in an **instant** (斯须)—both extremes are unwise. If one pursues **cessation of thought and non-visualization** (绝念无想), this is **true thought** (真念), which is **true emptiness** (真空). A single realm of **true emptiness** (真空) is the path to **transcend the mundane and enter the true** (朝真迁化), emerging from the **crossroads of delusion** (出昏衢) as a stage of **liberation** (超脱之渐).\n\nTo **lay the foundation** (开基) and **initiate the work** (创始), one must see **progress toward the Dao daily** (指日进功)—then **retaining visualization** (存想) may be applied. Moreover, as one **daily diminishes the self** (为道日损) to enter the **domain of the mysterious and elusive** (希夷之域), the **methods naturally simplify** (法自减省), and all depends on the **one who turns inward** (向观者).\"»\n\nLü said, *\"If one aligns the union of Dragon and Tiger to harmonize yin and yang, what is the visualization like?\"*\n\nZhōng replied, *\"At first, when uniting to establish the Water (坎) and Fire (离) trigrams, the visualization is this: the Nine Sovereign True Person (九皇真人) draws a small boy in crimson robes upward, while the Nine Sovereign True Mother (九皇真母) draws a small girl in black robes downward. They meet before the Yellow Hall (黄屋). A yellow-robed elderly woman guides them, observing the rites of mortal couples in perfect joy. The girl descends, the boy ascends—like parting in the mortal world. When done, the elderly woman cradles an object, shaped like a red tangerine, and casts it into the Yellow Hall, where it is kept in a golden vessel.\n\nThis boy is the Heavenly Stem (乾) seeking the Earthly Branch (坤); his yang returns to its original position, bearing yin back to its homeland. This girl is the Earthly Branch (坤) seeking the Heavenly Stem (乾); her yin embraces yang, reuniting with its homeland. This is the visualization of Water and Fire uniting to harmonize yin and yang.\n\nIf one gazes into the flaming center of the body (人中), a black dot ascends. In the surging waves of the lower abdomen (浪里), a red dragon descends. The two beasts meet at their roots, battling before the pavilion. The crimson gate opens wide—amidst swirling smoke and flames, a sovereign surveys the scene. Great fire engulfs the sky, yet above it surges a ten-thousand-fathom tide. Fire rises and falls, smoke filling heaven and earth. Dragon and Tiger coil and entwine, entering a golden vessel. Below, within the Yellow Hall, it seems placed in a cage or cabinet. This is the visualization of Dragon and Tiger uniting to transform into the Yellow Sprout (黄芽).\"*\n\nLü said, *\"Now that the harmonization of yin and yang, the transformation of Dragon and Tiger, and the methods of inner observation and visualization are known—what is the visualization for refining fire to forge the elixir?\"*\n\nZhōng replied, *\"The visualization is this: a vessel like a cauldron or pot, yellow or black in hue, shaped like a wheel. To its left stands the Green Dragon (青龙), to its right the White Tiger (白虎); before it the Vermilion Bird (朱雀), behind it the Dark Warrior (玄武). Flanking them are two ministers in purple robes, bowing and holding their jades. Below them, attendants and clerks stoke the fire beneath the vessel. Then comes a sovereign in crimson robes, riding a red steed, harnessing fire-clouds from the void, wielding a whip to urge the flames—lest they falter, lest the blaze grow weak. The fire blazes across the sky, as if breaking through the heavens. Though the Celestial Pass (天关) remains unopened, the smoke and flames descend in a ring around the vessel. The figures—the vessel, the sovereign, the ministers—all stand within the crimson flames, pointing and shouting, competing to stoke the fire further.\n\nWithin the vessel, the water is motionless, as if congealed. Within the water, the pearl is luminous, without shadow, its radiance undimmed. This is the visualization of refining fire to forge the elixir.\"*\n\nLü said, *\"Does inner observation and visualization cease at the stage of gathering herbs and stoking the fire? Or does it proceed step-by-step through the Dao/Way and its affairs?\"*\n\nZhōng replied, *\"When clouds and thunder descend, smoke and flames ascend. At times, the heavens rain upon strange flowers, and auspicious winds arise with celestial qi beneath the palace courtyard. At times, fairy maidens and jade women descend from the Azure Expanse (青霄) upon golden platters, bearing ambrosial dew and elixirial nectar, to present them to the sovereign. This is the visualization of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir (金液还丹) having reached completion.*\n\n*Or, when dragons and tigers drag their chariots through the fire, surging past the Three Celestial Passes (三关). The Three Passes each have soldiers and officials, numbering countless thousands. Armored warriors and weapons tremble in fear before humanity. First, the dragons and tigers are driven back by force; then, the great fire is lit, and the passes open only when the flames reach their peak—until they reach Kunlun Mountain (昆仑) and only then cease. At times, three cranes surge into the Three Heavens (三天), or twin butterflies enter the Three Palaces (三宫). At times, five-colored clouds bear a crimson-robed child past the Heavenly Gate (天门). At times, golden chariots and jade carriages transport the sovereign, ascending beyond the Three Realms (三界). This is the visualization of the Arm’s Reach Flying Gold (肘后飞金晶) and the Great River Wheel (大河车).*\n\n*Then, the crimson-robed emissary rides in his chariot, traversing from Ji Province (冀州) to Yan Province (兖州), from Yan Province to Qing Province (青州), from Qing Province to Xu Province (徐州), from Xu Province to Yang Province (扬州), from Yang Province to Jing Province (荆州), from Jing Province to Liang Province (梁州), from Liang Province to Yong Province (雍州), and from Yong Province back to Ji Province. East, west, south, and north—all converge harmoniously at Yu Province (豫州) before resuming his journey. The treasures he gathers are gold and jade; the matters he attends to are congealed and stagnant. With a single official issuing orders, the Nine Provinces (九州) unite in harmony. The cycle repeats endlessly, ceasing not in its motion. At times, he wanders the Five Sacred Mountains (五岳), beginning at Heng Mountain (恒山). At times, he sails the Five Lakes (五湖), beginning at the Northern Marsh (北沼). At times, celestial edicts command the Five Emperors (五帝), or royal decrees illuminate the Five Marshals (五候). This is the visualization of the Returning Elixir (还丹).*\n\n*Then, the Pearl Sovereign (珠王) scatters his jewels upon the earth. At times, rain and dew nourish all things, or the ocean tides flood the hundred rivers. At times, yin-essence (阴) arises to awaken the myriad transformations; at times, fire erupts to harmonize Heaven and Earth. At times, mist and vapor fill the cosmos. This is the visualization of refining the form (炼形).*\n\n*Finally, at times, it is like cranes abandoning their nests, or dragons emerging from their lairs. At times, it is like the Five Emperors ascending to Heaven, or the Five-Colored Clouds rising. At times, it is like straddling a Vermilion Phoenix (丹凤) and surging into the Jade Void (碧落). At times, it is like entering the Celestial Crossroads (天衢) in dreams, or celestial flowers descending in chaotic abundance, with discordant fairy music and golden radiance enveloping the palace halls and blossoming gardens. This is the visualization of the Supreme Court (朝元).*\n\n*After the Supreme Court, no further visualization is needed—only then is it called inner observation.\"*\n\nLü said, *\"To observe the profound principles within—this differs from the earlier methods. May I inquire further?\"*\n\nZhōng replied, *\"The practitioners of Dao across ages, failing to grasp Heaven’s hidden workings, began without comprehension. They relied on methods, seeking swift transcendence through forced breath retention—holding their breath to excess, eyes closed in inner observation. They halted within stillness, emitting only the yin spirit, thus becoming mere refined ghosts, not pure yang immortals.\n\nTrue immortals and sages, therefore, gather herbs, refine fire, extract lead and add mercury, return the elixir, refine the form, and unite at the Supreme Court. Though I speak at length to awaken the world, few truly understand—least of all the essence of inner observation. Yet this method is the very law of yin-yang transformation, the moment when mortal and immortal diverge.\n\nFor those who follow the Dao, even a slight hint of its use would be invaluable. Consider the earlier practices: their timing and methods are fixed. With sincere devotion and adherence to the law, even minor deviations yield results in due course. But inner observation demands no fixed time or method. One must dwell in profound stillness, day and night, upright and composed, discerning the yang spirit while banishing the yin ghosts.\n\nAs with Bodhidharma’s nine years facing the wall before entering the inner precincts, or the World-Honored One’s six years of silent meditation before escaping the bonds of the mundane—so too is inner observation a formidable challenge.\n\nAt first, one descends from above, transporting the *zǐhéchē* (purple river vehicle) into the Celestial Palace. Its wealth and grandeur—who would not admire? The comings and goings, the opulence and excess, the unseen wonders—all belong to the practitioner. Yet those who follow the Dao, accustomed to quietude and detachment, having long endured solitude, find fulfillment when their merit is complete. Towers of jade and pearl, female musicians and melodious pipes, rare delicacies and exotic flowers—every sight is vivid as day. The unenlightened mistake this for the true Celestial Palace, unaware that their own inner realm is mistaken for reality.\n\nIf they linger without entering or exiting, they become trapped in the murky crossroads, their form bound to the world, unable to transcend flesh for immortality. They have not yet reached the Celestial Palace—they remain in inner observation.\n\nThe yin ghosts and external demons arise from thought, which shapes illusions, which in turn create false realms—these are the demonic armies. Practitioners, misled, may plunge into madness or fall to external heresies, never attaining immortality. Some, ensnared by the Three Vermin and Seven Spirits, pray only for others’ deaths to satisfy their own desires. The Nine Worms and Six Afflictions torment them, finding no refuge in the living.\n\nThus, Zhōng and Lü transmitted the Dao.\"*\n\n「Discourse on the Difficulties of Demons (Section Seventeenth)\n\nLü said: *\"Through inner observation, one gathers the **Yangshen** (陽神), refining the **shen** (神) to transcend the **inner realm** (內院). With upward surging, one exits the **Celestial Gate** (天門), directly ascending to attain **sainthood** (聖品). Having emerged and re-entered, one moves freely without distinction—near or far, without error.\n\nIf one wishes to remain in the world, the **shen** merges with the form.\nIf one wishes to ascend as an immortal, one embarks on distant journeys to **Penglai Island** (蓬島).\n\nIf such practice fulfills the **three thousand stages of attainment** (三千功), one may achieve transcendence through inner observation alone.\nYet, if one does not know how to subdue the **yin ghosts** (阴鬼) and **external demons** (邪魔), practitioners of the Dao cannot ascend as immortals.\"*\n\nZhōng said: *\"Those who follow the Dao first cultivate **faith** (信心). Yet, through **favor, affection, fame, gain**—all worldly distractions (**恩、愛、名、利一切塵勞之事**)—they cannot alter their grand resolve (**大志**).\n\nNext, they forge **bitter resolve** (苦志), enduring **toil and solitude**—all realms of **purity and emptiness** (清虚之境)—yet fail to preserve their initial **faith** and **bitter resolve**. They must either perfect the **great attainment** (大成) or settle for the **middle attainment** (中成). If they seek only the **middle attainment**, they may attain no more than the **minor attainment** (小成).\n\nWhat if they fail to recognize the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) and cannot grasp the **Celestial Mechanism** (天機)?\nThey cling to petty methods (**小法**) while favoring **heterodox doctrines** (异端).\nYears pass in vain (**歲月磋跎**), yet no progress is seen.\nIn their later years, they grow weary (**晚年袁老**) and return to the cycle of rebirth (**輪回**).\nThis causes those who earnestly seek the Dao to dismiss **longevity** (長生) as idle talk and **transcendence** (超脱) as empty words.\n\nOften, they hear the Dao yet do not believe it.\nEven if their hearts believe, they lack **bitter resolve**.\nWhen confronted with external influences, they generate thoughts (**對境生心**), letting worldly matters (**物**) destroy their resolve (**志**).\nThus, they can never escape the **Ten Demons** (十魔) and **Nine Difficulties** (九難).\"*\n\nLü asked: *\"What are these **Nine Difficulties** (九難) of which you speak?\"*\n\nZhōng replied:\n\n*\"Before the Great Elixir is complete, one must endure cold and heat—\nwithin a single year, four seasons demand clothing.\nBefore true qi arises, hunger and thirst remain—\nwithin a day, three meals are required.\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is the pressure of **clothing and food**—the **First Difficulty**.\n\nAnd when past karmic debts are heavy, they manifest in this life as repayment.\nEven in stolen moments of leisure, they are still bound by elders’ constraints.\nBound by filial duty yet unwilling to depart,\nthey seek tranquility yet find no respite.\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is the **restraint of elders**—the **Second Difficulty**.\n\nThen there are those bound by love—wives and children—\nor by pity—parents—\nas emotional shackles tighten daily.\nLike a **hell of fire** or a **quagmire of sorrow**, they know no rest.\nEven with a serene mind, they cannot resist the **torment of worldly cares**.\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is the **entanglement of affection**—the **Third Difficulty**.\n\nAnd when wealth rivals that of ten thousand households,\nor nobility reaches the **Three Exalted Dignities**,\nthe deluded mind refuses to rest,\nwhile the greedy fear want.\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is the **shackles of fame and gain**—the **Fourth Difficulty**.\n\nOr when youth neglects cultivation,\nweakened by **qi deficiency**, their stubborn hearts know no awakening—\nor when **yin roots** fester into calamity,\nsuffering in this life as a warning to future generations.\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is **sudden misfortune**—the **Fifth Difficulty**.\n\nOr when people, desperate over life and death,\nseek teachers without discernment—\nsome follow those skilled in eloquence,\nothers those with **moral facade and ancient mien**.\nAt first, they believe they’ve met immortals,\nonly to later realize they’ve been deceived by self-serving men.\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is the **bondage of blind teachers**—the **Sixth Difficulty**.\n\nOr when blind teachers and deluded companions mislead,\npicking at **branches while ignoring the root**,\nclinging to petty methods and heterodox doctrines,\nmutually pointing out flaws.\nYet they do not know:\nthe sun and moon do not rise unless they shine brightly—\nall who have eyes see them.\nThunder does not strike unless it terrifies—\nall who have ears hear it.\nHow could the flickering glow of a candle\nor the croaking of frogs\never align in truth?\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is **divisive debates**—the **Seventh Difficulty**.\n\nOr when one acts in the morning yet changes by evening,\nsits yet stands with resolve,\ndelights in fleeting moments yet tires of endurance,\nbegins with diligence yet ends in slackness.\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is **waning resolve**—the **Eighth Difficulty**.\n\nOr when years slip away unnoticed,\nmonths pass in obscurity,\ndays blur without mark,\nand moments dissolve without trace.\nYouth does not forget ambition,\nold age clings to grandchildren.\nLife’s light is limited—\ndo not wait for next year, thinking this one is spent.\nWorldly affairs are endless—\ndo not wait for tomorrow, thinking today is past.\nEven today is not guaranteed for tomorrow—\nhow can old age reclaim youth?\nWhat afflicts those who follow the Dao is **wasted time**—the **Ninth Difficulty**.\n\nTo escape these Nine Difficulties is to truly follow the Dao.\nYet within them, even one or two that cannot be overcome\nwill leave one exhausted, unable to succeed.\"*\n\nLü asked: *\"Now that the Nine Difficulties are known,\nmay I inquire about the **Ten Demons**?\"*\n\nZhōng replied:\n\n*\"The **Ten Demons** fall into three categories:\n**External perceptions**, **dreams**, and **internal visions**.\n\nAs if seeing **flowering eyes** and fragrant blossoms,\nhearing **zithers and pipes** resound—\nthe tongue craves sweetness,\nthe nose delights in strange scents,\nemotions relax, spirits soar.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Six Thief-Demons**.\n\nOr **jewel-pillared halls**, carved beams and embroidered curtains,\npearl screens and silk canopies,\nlantern-lit chambers scented with orchids—\ngolden sands beneath, jade and gems in abundance.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of Wealth**.\n\nOr **gold-saddled steeds**, towering canopies,\nten thousand households under their banner,\nenvoys with banners and flags,\nentire clans in **green and purple robes**,\nwhips and tablets piled high.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of Nobility**.\n\nOr **drifting mists**, warm sunbeams,\nsudden storms, thunder and lightning,\nmelodies rising, cries of sorrow.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Six Emotional Demons**.\n\nOr relatives in distress, loved ones in ruin,\nchildren sick, parents dead,\nbrothers scattered, wives divided.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of Affection**.\n\nOr falling into **fire pits**, tumbling from cliffs,\nharmed by venomous beasts or poisoned drugs,\nencountering bandits, dying by the law.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of Suffering**.\n\nOr standing beneath the **Ten Directions’ sun**,\nbefore the **Three Pure Ones** and **Four Celestials**,\nthe **Seven Luminaries** and **Eight Immortals**,\ntheir awe-inspiring presence descending and soaring.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of Saints and Worthies**.\n\nOr armies massing like clouds,\nweapons gleaming like frost,\nspears and halberds raised, bows drawn—\nrushing slaughter, swift and relentless.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of War**.\n\nOr **celestial maidens** in procession,\nmelodies swelling, **Cloud-Soaring Dance** performed,\nred sleeves paired, golden cups offered.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of Music**.\n\nOr countless beauties in **heavy makeup**,\nnight feasts at the **Lan Pavilion**,\nlight robes revealing jade-like bodies,\narrogant allure, vying for pairs.\nIf perceived, yet not recognized—this is the **Demons of Female Desire**.\n\nThese are the Ten Demons—\nfew escape recognizing them.\nOnce recognized, one becomes attached;\nonce attached, one is ensnared—\nthus, the Dao remains unattained.\nYet if one who follows the Dao\nsees external perceptions yet neither recognizes nor clings,\ntheir heart will not falter, nor their resolve shift.\"*\n\nThe slumbering mind unrecognizing and unattached,\nthen the spirit does not stray while vision remains undistracted.\n\nIn moments of inward observation,\nif such sights arise, one must discern their emptiness and truth,\ndistinguish illusion from reality—\ndo not follow the waves like a leaf,\nmistaking the thief for kin.\n\nSwiftly awaken the **Three Refined Fires** to purge the body,\nwith a single stroke, all demons dissolve.\n\nEmploy the **Purple River Cart** to convey one’s **Yang Spirit**,\nascend the **Inner Palace** to the **Celestial Realm**,\nthen seek transcendence.\n\nFrom ancient to modern, those who claim to follow the Dao,\nwith hearts of purity and stillness,\nyet shift resolve when confronted by phenomena—\noften they cannot escape the **Ten Demons’ Nine Trials**.\n\nThey may hold the Dao’s name in vain,\nyet never glimpse its true attainment.\n\nOr they withdraw from worldly toil,\nsecluded in hidden solitude, their aim the **Mysterious Gate**.\n\nYet unable to dispel the Nine Trials,\nthey cling to one or two of the Ten Demons.\n\nNot that they fail to attain the Dao,\nbut within its path they achieve **partial enlightenment** or **small enlightenment**.\n\nAnd among the immortals,\nthey become either **Human Transcendents** or **Earthbound Transcendents**.\n\nIf one thoroughly dispels the demons and trials,\ngradually verifying each stage of attainment,\nand unites inward observation with the **Yang Spirit**,\nthen in due course they shall return to the **Three Isles**.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: On Verification and Attainment**\n\nLü said:\n*\"The ailing fear sickness—yet those who seek the Dao desire to be free of illness and live long.\nThe fearful fear death—yet those who seek the Dao wish to avoid death and attain longevity.\nAll mortals dwell within the world—yet those who seek the Dao aspire to transcend and roam beyond.\nAll mortals remain earthbound—yet those who seek the Dao aim to surpass humanity and enter the **Caverns of the Immortals**.\n\nThus, they endure hardship and poverty with equanimity, their hearts wandering in **purity and detachment**, their traces hidden in desolate, remote lands.\nThey persist in practice, yet remain unaware of the depth of their efforts, the shifting of methods, or the timing of transformation—whether early or late.\nAfter exerting their labor, how does one know the sequence of verification and attainment?\"*\n\nZhōng replied:\n*\"Those who labor with unwavering resolve yet see no results are not betrayed by the Dao.\nRather, they follow the Dao without a **true teacher**, and what they received was not the **authentic method**.\nThose who adhere to the method yet still see no results are not betrayed by the Dao.\nRather, they follow the Dao without understanding the **proper timing**, and thus fail to succeed.\nIf one encounters a **true teacher** and obtains the **authentic method**, practicing the **Great Method** in accordance with the times—what fear is there that verification and attainment will not come?\"*\n\nLü said:\n*\"By ‘method,’ do you mean there are a set number?\nBy ‘times,’ do you mean there are a set number?\"*\n\nZhōng replied:\n*\"The **method** comprises twelve categories:\n1. **Harmonizing Yin-Yang** (first),\n2. **Gathering and Dispersing Water and Fire** (second),\n3. **Coppulation of Dragon and Tiger** (third),\n4. **Smelting and Refining Elixirs** (fourth),\n5. **Posture of the Arm’s End and Flying Metal Crystals** (fifth),\n6. **Jade Nectar Reversion Elixir** (sixth),\n7. **Jade Nectar Refining the Form** (seventh),\n8. **Golden Nectar Reversion Elixir** (eighth),\n9. **Golden Nectar Refining the Form** (ninth),\n10. **Morning Element Cultivation of Qi** (tenth),\n11. **Inner Observation and Exchange** (eleventh),\n12. **Transcendence and Division of Form** (twelfth).\n\nAs for **timing**, it follows the annual cycles of Heaven and Earth’s Yin-Yang ascent and descent, and the monthly cycles of the Sun and Moon’s reciprocal movements.\n\nWithin a day, there are the **Four Pillars**, **Eight Trigrams**, **Ten Equinoxes**, **Twelve Earthly Branches**, **One Hundred Moments**, and **Six Thousand Subdivisions**.\nBy adhering to the method and dividing these precisely, from the first day onward, the sequence of verification and attainment—until the dissolution of form and ascension—will not deviate by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nAt first, licentiousness and impurities are purged, and both external practices and cultivation are undertaken. In gathering herbs, the **Golden Essence** fills the body, the mind clears, and **Yin-demons** are subdued.\nNext, the **Heart-Canal** surges upward, and sweet nectar appears in the mouth.\nNext, Yin and Yang clash, and thunderous sounds are heard within the abdomen at times.\nNext, the **soul and spirit** become unstable, and dreams are filled with terrifying visions.\nNext, the **six bowels and four limbs** develop minor ailments or illnesses, which heal without treatment.\nNext, the **Dan-field** grows warm at night, and the physique becomes refined and clear by day.\nNext, in darkness, divine light emanates from the eyes.\nNext, dreams are filled with heroic vigor—no harm can be done by external forces, nor can one be deceived by others. Sometimes, it feels as though one embraces an infant upon returning.\nNext, the **Golden Lock and Jade Barrier** seal firmly, halting dream emissions and leakage.\nNext, a thunderous sound erupts, joints connect, and sweat pours forth in shock.\nNext, **Jade Nectar** is brewed and congeals into solidified fat.\nNext, **Divine Nectar** forms into a paste, and one gradually abhors carrion and foul odors, filling the mouth and stomach.\nNext, the **earthly bones** lighten, transforming into a **Yang-Spirit**, moving like galloping horses, and stopping like flight.\nNext, encountering the world leaves no trace in the mind, and desires are severed.\nNext, **True Qi** enters objects, enabling the healing of others’ illnesses.\nNext, **Inner Observation** becomes luminous and unobscured.\nNext, the pupils darken like lacquer, wrinkles smooth, and **purple hair regrows**; those who were aged retain eternal youth.\nNext, **True Qi** grows abundant, resembling constant satiety, yet food intake is minimal and wine consumption boundless—intoxication never occurs.\nNext, the body radiates luster, and divine aura is refined and enchanting. **Sacred Elixir** generates flavor, and **Divine Nectar** emits fragrance, filling the mouth and nostrils. Others may detect it, though they cannot name it. Next, vision sharpens to discern autumn hairs at a hundred paces.\nNext, old scars and blemishes vanish naturally, and tears, saliva, and sweat cease to appear.\nNext, the **embryonic breath** solidifies, cutting off the need for food and drink.\nNext, the **inner will** ascends to purity, merging with the **Great Void**, severing all mundane affections and desires.\nNext, the **Nine Worms** are exterminated, and the **Three Corpses** are slain.\nNext, the **soul and spirit** no longer wander, ending dreams.\nNext, divine splendor and vitality know no day or night.\nNext, **Yang-Essence** forms the body, the **Spirit Storehouse** is fortified, and the four limbs fear neither cold nor heat.\nNext, death and life hold no sway, and in **Forgetting-While-Sitting** and **Inner Observation**, one wanders the **Land of Great Illusion**.\nNext, the **Land of Immortals** unfolds—with maidens, pavilions, and boundless splendor far beyond mortal realms.\nNext, when cultivation is complete and practice fulfilled, **Yin-rewards** manifest, and the **True Seals of the Three Pure Ones** are bestowed.\nNext, **Yin-Yang transformations** allow foreknowledge of human affairs and premonitions of calamities.\nNext, mundane filth repels one, and in seclusion, the **Embryonic Immortal** becomes visible. A second body emerges beyond the physical form—this is **Divine Holiness**.\nNext, **True Qi** becomes purely Yang, and breath can subdue external **Mercury**.\nNext, the **Embryonic Immortal** yearns to ascend, and auspicious light fills the chamber.\nNext, music is heard in stillness.\nNext, even noblemen’s presence elicits revulsion—common bones and vulgar flesh.\nNext, divine splendor shifts at will, and through **Secret Rites**, the **Immortal Form** is perfected, resembling a **Jade Tree**, with golden bones piercing through.\nNext, wherever one goes, divine attendants appear, obeying summons like extensions of one’s own will.\nNext, in stillness, **Purple Mists** fill the vision, and a golden canopy radiates beneath the crown.\nNext, within the body, a **Fire Dragon** suddenly takes flight, or a **Dark Crane** rises—this marks the **Divine Soul** having shed mortal form and transcended the vulgar.\nAfter **Transcendence**, **Rainbow Mists** swirl, **Auspicious Qi** gathers, **Heaven rains rare flowers**, and **Dark Cranes** fly in pairs.\nNext, **Mystic Fragrance** disperses, and **Jade Maidens** descend, bestowing **Heavenly Scriptures** and **Purple Edicts**. Then, **Immortal Headgear, Immortal Garments**, and their kind are complete.\nTheir **Aura and Demeanor** are beyond enumeration—guided and escorted, they return to **Penglai**, where they pay homage to the **True Lord of the Purple Palace**.\nTheir **Native Place, Clan, and Name** are verified, and their **Merits and Practices** are weighed. Only then do they reside in the **Three Isles**, becoming **True Persons and Immortal Children.**\"\n\nLü said:\n*\"Today, I am uniquely honored to hear from my teacher the **Great Principles of Xi-Yi** and the **Mysteries of Heaven and Earth.**\"*\n\nThe Way does not merely stop at the clarity of the senses and the refinement of spirit and form.\nThough the mortal frame has a resting place, it shall not share the fate of the dust and clay.\n\nYet those who know may not necessarily practice, and those who practice may not necessarily attain.\nReflecting that life and death are of utmost consequence while time flees swiftly—even if one understands the subtle truths, without practice and steadfastness, success remains unattainable, no different from ignorance—\nI dare to seek your guidance on the timing and method of practice:\nHow does one begin?\nHow does one cultivate?\n\nZhong replied:\n*\"I possess the *Lingbao Bifa* in ten volumes, twelve chapters.\nWithin are six essential teachings:\nFirst, the **Golden Edicts** (*Jin Gào*);\nSecond, the **Jade Scriptures** (*Yu Shu*);\nThird, the **True Essence** (*Zhen Yuan*);\nFourth, **Parables** (*Bi Yu*);\nFifth, the **True Secrets** (*Zhen Jue*);\nSixth, the **Dao Essentials** (*Dao Yao*).\nIt encompasses the Great Dao, drawing analogies from the Three Pure Ones.\nIt sets as its model the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang,\nAnd takes as its principle the interplay of the sun and moon’s refined essences.\nIt embodies the intent of the Five Immortals and establishes the pattern of the Three Completions.\nOn a chosen day, I shall transmit these to you.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**The *Zhong Lü Transmission of the Dao* (18 scrolls)**\n*Inscribed by the True Person of Zhengyang, Zhongli Quan, recounting the Pure Yang True Person Lü Dongbin’s (Master Hongjun) teachings, transmitted by the True Person of Huayang, Shi Jianwu (Master Xisheng).*\n*Composed entirely in question-and-answer form.*\n\n**Discourse on True Immortals (First)**\nLü said: *\"When a person is born—secure yet free of illness, vigorous yet free of aging, alive yet free of death—what Dao can achieve this?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"A person’s birth begins when the two *qi* of father and mother converge, their essence and blood forming the embryo. After the Primordial Beginning (*Taichu*), the primordial substance (*taizhi*) takes form. Yin sustains yang’s generation; *qi* follows the embryo’s transformation, and after three hundred days, the form is complete. The luminous spirit enters the body, separating from the mother. From the Primordial Substance onward, the *qi* ascends and descends, nurturing the yellow sprout. At five thousand days, the *qi* is full, its measure reaching eighty-one *zhang*. At fifteen, one is called a ‘boy’—when yin contains half of yang, like the light of the rising sun. Beyond this point, the primordial yang scatters, true *qi* dissipates, and weakness brings illness, aging, death, and extinction. A lifetime of ignorance damages the luminous spirit; a lifetime of folly depletes one’s allotted years. Thus, birth and death differ in rank, and lifespans vary in length. Born, then annihilated; annihilated, then reborn—cycle after cycle, unaware, one falls into other realms, losing one’s true form to alien shells. The root of true nature is lost to humanity, trapped in samsaric revolutions with no escape. Only if one encounters a True Immortal or Perfected Sage can one’s sins be purged, the old skin shed, and a human form regained. Yet even then, lingering in stupidity and illness, one accumulates karmic debts across lifetimes, ascending to blessed lands only to still suffer hunger, cold, and calamity. Through gradual refinement, one may attain a complete form—but remains bound to servitude and lowly stations. Should one repeat past transgressions, like a ball rolling off a board, one returns to samsaric cycles.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Born in the Central Realm, fortunate to live in peace, with food and time not yet scarce—those who love are at ease, those who resent fall ill, the greedy live on, the fearful perish. Today, I kneel before my revered teacher, twice bowing, twice pleading: given that birth and death are paramount, may I humbly beg for instruction on the principles of avoiding illness, aging, and death, and be guided by my teacher?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"To escape samsara, avoid alien forms, and ensure a body free of illness, aging, death, and suffering—standing firm beneath heaven, embracing yin and cradling yang as a true human—this is the path. Among humans, some refine to become immortals; among immortals, some ascend to heaven.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The dead become ghosts; those who attain the Dao become immortals. If immortals are of one rank, why speak of ascending from immortality to heaven?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Immortals are not one. Pure yin without yang is a ghost; pure yang without yin is an immortal; a mix of yin and yang is a human. Only humans can become ghosts or immortals. Youth who do not cultivate, indulging in licentiousness, die and become ghosts. Those who awaken and refine transcend humanity, shedding their form to become immortals. There are five ranks of immortals and three stages of attainment. Cultivation lies with the practitioner, and fulfillment follows one’s capacity.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"You speak of three stages of attainment and five ranks of immortals—why?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"The three stages are lesser, middle, and greater attainment. The five ranks are: ghost-immortals, human-immortals, earth-immortals, spirit-immortals, and heavenly-immortals—all are immortals. Ghost-immortals remain bound to ghosts; human-immortals to humanity; earth-immortals to the earth; spirit-immortals to the spirit realm; heavenly-immortals to heaven.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What are these ‘ghost-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"The lowest of the five immortals. Though they escape the yin realm, their divine forms are unclear, their ghostly essence nameless in the Three Mountains, their names unknown in Penglai. Though they avoid rebirth, they cannot return to the immortal lands. They have no true abode, only the chance to be reborn into another form.\"*",

Their bodies are like gnarled wood, their minds like dead ashes, their spirit and consciousness held inward, their resolve unshaken. Within meditation, they emerge with a yin-born spirit—thus a pure and luminous ghost, not a true Daoist immortal. Since their single resolve does not scatter and their yin-essence lingers, they are called ‘ghost-immortals.’ Though called immortals, they are truly ghosts. The ancients and modern adherents of the *Chóngshì* sect, when their efforts reach this point, claim they have attained the Dao—how laughable!\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Then what are these ‘human-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Human-immortals are the second lowest of the five.

Those who forget the Seven Emotions, how could they grasp the Ten *Jiè*? Those who practice *Shùyǎn* spitting, yet take breath in wrongly. Those who wear *Cǎibǔ* patches, yet mock *Qīngjìng* purity as foolishness. Those who greedily seize external *qi* to cheat Heaven and Earth, yet refuse to abstain from food. Those who cling to visualization, yet neglect *Dǎoyǐn* exercises. Alone they sit, breath confined—how could they know of *Zìrán*? They strain their bodies, yet fail to recognize *Wúwéi*. They draw yin-qi from women, differing not from those who shrink the Golden Tortoise. They nourish yang with girl’s milk, differing not from those who refine elixirs. By such analogies, one could enumerate their errors endlessly. Yet all these are still Dao, though they cannot fulfill the Great Dao. They merely achieve minor comforts, longevity, and ease within one method or technique—thus they are called ‘human-immortals.’ And there are many more in the world who, delighting in fleeting gains yet weary of sustained effort, practice carelessly, misjudging times and days, and instead bring on sickness while failing to extend their years.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Then what are these ‘earth-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Earth-immortals are the midpoint between mortal and Daoist, possessing the potential of spirit-immortals.

      "translated_text": "Lü said: *\"How does one begin the practice of ‘earth-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"First, one must follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent, and take the numbers of the Sun and Moon’s generation and growth. Within the body, one applies the cycles of years and months; within the day, one applies the moments of time. First, one must recognize the **Dragon** and **Tiger** [1], then align the **Kàn** and **Lí** [2]. One distinguishes the purity and turbidity of water, and divides the **qi** and climate into early and late. One gathers the **Zhēn Yī** [True Unity/essence and breath], observes the **Èr Yī** [Two Principles/yang and yin], arranges the **Sān Cái** [Three Talents/Heaven, Earth, and humanity], divides the **Sì Xiàng** [Four Symbols/Four Celestial Animals], separates the **Wǔ Yùn** [Five Phases], stabilizes the **Liù Qì** [Six Qi], collects the **Qí Bǎo** [Seven Treasures], sequences the **Bā Guà** [Eight Trigrams], and traverses the **Jiǔ Zhōu** [Nine Continents]. When the Five Phases are inverted, the **qi** flows to the **mother phase** while the **liquid essence** circulates between the **father and mother phases** [3]. The **Three Fields** [4] are reversed in repetition, refining into elixirs. One permanently subdues the lower field, refines the form to dwell in the world, and thus attains immortality—this is called ‘earth-immortal.’\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What are these ‘spirit-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Spirit-immortals are those who, having grown weary of earthly residence as earth-immortals, yet persist in their practice without ceasing. When their joints are harmonized, they extract lead and add mercury, refining the **golden essence** to the vertex. The **jade liquid** returns to the elixir field, where the formed **qi** aligns with the Five Qi toward the **primordial source** [5], and the Three Yangs gather at the crown. When their practice is complete, they forget their form, and the **embryonic immortal** transforms naturally. With yin exhausted and yang pure, they attain a body beyond the body. Abandoning their physical substance, they ascend as immortals, transcending the mundane to become **sages**. They reject worldly affairs and return to the **Three Mountains** [6], thus they are called ‘spirit-immortals.’\"*\n\nLü said: *\"What then are these ‘heaven-immortals’?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Earth-immortals who grow weary of the Three Mountains and instead transmit the Dao to the world—where their practice yields results and their deeds are manifest—when both are fulfilled, they receive the **Heavenly Scripture** and return to the **Cave of Heaven** [7], and this is called ‘heaven-immortal.’ If they then grow weary of the Cave of Heaven and take up official duties as immortal officials, they are called: the lower **Water Official**, the middle **Earth Official**, and the upper **Heaven Official**. Their contributions to Heaven and Earth are vast, and their deeds in the present and past are profound. Ascending through official ranks, they traverse the **Thirty-Six Caves of Heaven** and return to the **Eighty-One Yang Skies** [8], ultimately ascending to the realm of the **Three Pure Ones** [9] in **Natural Emptiness** [10].\"*\n\nLü said: *\"‘Ghost-immortals’ are indeed unattainable, and ‘heaven-immortals’ are beyond my daring to aspire to.

Yet still, they do not attain longevity or ascension. Why is this?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Their methods do not align with the Dao.

Earth, obtaining the *Kūn* Dao, functions through *yin*—*yin* governs descent, so how does it interact with Heaven? If Heaven and Earth do not interact, how can *yin* and *yang* unite? If *yin* and *yang* do not unite, how can *Qián* and *Kūn* operate? If *Qián* and *Kūn* have no operation, though there be beginnings and days of efficacy, how can the great Dao be attained?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“Heaven’s Dao takes *Qián* as its essence, *yang* as its function, and accumulates *qi* above. Earth’s Dao takes *Kūn* as its essence, *yin* as its function, and accumulates water below. Heaven, in its Dao, uses *Qián* to probe *Kūn*. The first probing yields the eldest son—*Zhèn*. The second probing yields the middle son—*Kàn*. The third probing yields the youngest son—*Gèn*. Thus, Heaven interacts with Earth, using the *Qián* Dao to probe the *Kūn* Dao and generate the three *yang*s.\n\nWhen Earth, in its Dao, uses *Kūn* to probe *Qián*, the first probing yields the eldest daughter—*Xùn*. The second probing yields the middle daughter—*Lí*. The third probing yields the youngest daughter—*Duì*. Thus, Earth interacts with Heaven, using the *Kūn* Dao to probe the *Qián* Dao and generate the three *yin*s. The three *yang*s unite with the three *yin*s, and all things are born. The three *yin*s unite with the three *yang*s, and all things are completed. Heaven and Earth’s union originates from *Qián* and *Kūn* probing each other and moving within the Dao. *Qián* and *Kūn* probing each other generate the six *qi*; the six *qi* intermingling differentiate the five phases; the five phases intermingling give rise to all things.\n\nWhen the *Qián* Dao descends, the three probings completed, the *yang* ascends anew—*yang* within concealing *yin*, returning to Heaven. When the *Kūn* Dao ascends, the three probings completed, the *yin* descends anew—*yin* within concealing *yang*, returning to Earth. *Yang* concealing *yin*, the *yin* does not dissipate—this is called *true yin*. *True yin* reaches Heaven, born through *yang*, hence *yin* descends from Heaven—how could *yin* within lack *yang*? *Yin* concealing *yang*, the *yang* does not perish—this is called *true yang*. *True yang* reaches Earth, born through *yin*, hence *yang* ascends from Earth—how could *yang* within lack *yin*? *Yang* concealing *yin* returns to Earth; *yin* concealing *yang* returns to Heaven. Thus, it cycles endlessly without cessation. Their union never strays from the Dao—that is how they attain enduring firmness.”*\n\nLü said: *“Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms, moving within the Dao to attain enduring firmness, are the operations of Heaven and Earth. Yet humanity, though endowed with wisdom, attends to purity of mind. Seeking to practice the great Dao—whether to secure minor comfort and longevity, moderate immortality, or supreme transcendence—how should one operate and move within the Dao, activating Heaven’s mechanisms, to also attain enduring firmness and eternal preservation?”*\n\nZhōng said: *“The great Dao is formless; it takes form through what it obtains. The great Dao is nameless; it takes names through what it possesses. Heaven and Earth obtain it, and it is called the *Qián-Kūn* Dao. The sun and moon obtain it, and it is called the *yin* and *yang* Dao. If humanity obtains it, in the court it is called the Dao of *junzi* and ministers; in the inner chambers, the Dao of husband and wife; in the village, the Dao of elders and juniors; in the schools, the Dao of friends; in the home, the Dao of father and son. Thus, all outward manifestations are governed by the Dao.\n\nAs for parents’ union: the father’s *yang* advances first, followed by *yin*, true *qi* meeting true water—heart-fire and kidney-water intermingling, refined into essence. Once essence emerges, the mother’s *yin* advances first, her water cleansing what is useless. Then the mother’s *yang* advances, her blood receiving at the palace’s gate. Essence and blood form the embryo, containing true *qi* within the mother’s womb. Over days and months, true *qi* transforms and gives birth to humanity, as Heaven and Earth move in their Dao—*Qián* and *Kūn* probing each other—generating the three *ming* and three *yang*s.\n\nTrue *qi* is *yang*; true water is *yin*. *Yang* is concealed within water; *yin* is concealed within *qi*. *Qi* governs ascent, yet within it lies true water. Water governs descent, yet within it lies true *qi*. True water is *true yin*; true *qi* is *true yang*. *True yang* descends with water, as *Qián* probes *Kūn*—above is *Zhèn*, middle is *Kàn*, below is *Gèn*. Compared to humanity, taking the center as measure, from above to below: *Zhèn* is the liver, *Kàn* the kidneys, *Gèn* the bladder.\n\n*True yin* ascends with *qi*, as *Kūn* probes *Qián*—below is *Xùn*, middle is *Lí*, above is *Duì*.”*",

Those who cultivate the Dao—if they take Heaven and Earth as their model—can attain longevity and never die. If they emulate the sun and moon’s movements, their rising and setting, their conjunctions and separations, they reach the point where the moon absorbs the sun’s *hún* (essence), turning yang into yin. When yin is complete and yang is pure, the moon’s radiance becomes clear and bright, dispelling the dark *pò* (corporeal shadow) like the sun’s luminous splendor, illuminating all above and below.

A human lifespan spans a hundred years: from one year to thirty is the time of youthful vigor, from thirty to sixty is the time of full maturity, from sixty to ninety is the time of old age, and from ninety to a hundred—or even a hundred and twenty—is the time of decline. This is the first gradation: the time within the body.\n\nIf one divides a day into twelve *chén* (double-hours), five *chén* as one *hòu* (watch), three *hòu* as one *qì* (phase), three *qì* as one *jié* (seasonal node), and two *jié* as one *shí* (season), then there are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. When it is spring, yin contains half-yang, and the *qì* shifts from cold to warmth—that is the time of spring. When it is summer, yang contains full yang, and the *qì* shifts from warmth to heat—that is the time of summer. When it is autumn, yang contains half-yin, and the *qì* shifts from heat to cool—that is the time of autumn. When it is winter, yin contains full yin, and the *qì* shifts from cool to cold—that is the time of winter. This is the second gradation: the time within the year.\n\nIf one takes the *lǚ* (sixth tone) rising from *lǘ* (fifth tone) and *lǘ* rising from *lǚ*, then in a month of thirty days, there are three hundred and sixty *chén*, three thousand *kè* (moments), and one hundred and eighty ten-thousandths. From the new moon to the first quarter, yin contains half-yang. From the first quarter to the full moon, yang contains full yang. From the full moon to the last quarter, yang contains half-yin. From the last quarter to the dark moon, yin contains full yin. This is the third gradation: the time within the month.\n\nIf one divides sixty *fēn* (minutes) as one *kè*, eight *kè* and twenty *fēn* as one *shí* (hour), and one *shí* and a half as one *guà* (trigram), then the *guà* determines the eight directions, and its correctness divides the four cardinal positions. From *zǐ* (11 PM–1 AM) to *mǎo* (5–7 AM), yin contains half-yang, and from *Tàimíng* (Great Brightness) arises *Shàoyáng* (Lesser Yang). From *mǎo* to *wǔ* (11 AM–1 PM), yang contains full yang, and pure *Shàoyáng* arises *Tàiyáng* (Greater Yang). From *wǔ* to *yǒu* (5–7 PM), yang contains half-yin, and from *Tàiyáng* arises *Shàoyīn* (Lesser Yin). From *yǒu* to *zǐ*, yin contains full yin, and pure *Shàoyīn* arises *Tàiyīn* (Greater Yin). This is the fourth gradation: the time within the day.\n\nWhat is hard to obtain yet easy to lose is the time within the body; what departs swiftly yet returns slowly is the time within the year. Like lightning, swift as a falling stone is the time within the day. Days accumulate into months, months into years—years slip by, and time races forward. Chasing fame and profit while the restless mind remains unchecked, loving children and doting on grandchildren while affection still lingers. Even if one turns back to the Dao, how can one contend with aging and declining *qì*? Like spring snow or autumn flowers, only fleeting beauty remains; like evening sun or morning moon, no lasting light endures.\n\nThose who follow the Dao find the time within the body hard to obtain. In the radiant sun and charming scenery, a hundred blossoms bloom fragrant. In pavilions by the water or towering halls, the cool breeze brings delight. Under moonlit nights in leisurely talk, or snow-filled days in shared drink—indulging in boundless pleasures, wasting limited time. Even if one turns back to the Dao, it must be when sickness binds them. Like a broken boat yet to cross, who would not seek rescue? Like a leaking roof needing repair, who would abandon hope of mending it? Those who follow the Dao have wasted their youthful years in vain.\n\nBefore the rooster crows, stepping out feels too late. When the street drums sound, returning home feels too early. Greed and delusion refuse to pause, vain thoughts fear no end. A hall filled with gold and jade—what use when sickness strikes? A single glance at grandchildren—who can replace the breath that fades? Day and night pass without cease, yet none awaken. Those who follow the Dao lament the time within the day.\n\nLǚ said: *\"The time within the body, the time within the year, the time within the month, and the time within the day—all are time. Yet you, Master, say the time within the body is hard to obtain, and the time within the day is most regrettable. Why?\"*\n\nZhōng replied:\n*\"Those who follow the Dao find youth hard to obtain. Cultivating in youth strengthens the primordial roots—all things are easily accomplished, and great success may be achieved in a thousand days. Those who follow the Dao also find middle age hard to obtain. Cultivating in middle age first completes what was lacking, then advances further. Initially, one reverses aging to return to youth, then enters the realm of transcending humanity. If one does not awaken in youth nor reflect in middle age, perhaps through calamity they turn to quietude, or through illness they aspire to the lofty. Cultivating in old age first addresses preservation, then speaks of nourishment. Then, through minor accomplishments, one accumulates *qì* until reaching middle attainment, and from middle attainment, one reverses aging to return to youth, refining the form to dwell in the world. Yet the five *qì* cannot converge at the *yuán* (origin), and the three yangs struggle to gather at the crown. Ascending as an immortal, transcending the physical—such fates are beyond reach. Thus, the time within the body is hard to obtain.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Lü said: *\"If the Five Phases manifest in the seasons in this way, how do they manifest in the human body?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"In humans, the head is round and the feet are square—mirroring the forms of Heaven and Earth. The rise and fall of yin and yang reflect the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth. The kidneys correspond to Water, the heart to Fire, the liver to Wood, the lungs to Metal, and the spleen to Earth. If we consider the Five Phases generating one another, then Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, and Metal generates Water. The generator is the mother; the generated is the child. If we consider the Five Phases restraining one another, then Water restrains Fire, Fire restrains Metal, Metal restrains Wood, Wood restrains Earth, and Earth restrains Water. The restrainer is the husband; the restrained is the wife.\n\nIn terms of mother-child relationships: the qi of the kidneys generates the qi of the liver, the qi of the liver generates the qi of the heart, the qi of the heart generates the qi of the spleen, the qi of the spleen generates the qi of the lungs, and the qi of the lungs generates the qi of the kidneys. In terms of husband-wife relationships: the qi of the kidneys restrains the qi of the heart, the qi of the heart restrains the qi of the lungs, the qi of the lungs restrains the qi of the liver, the qi of the liver restrains the qi of the spleen, and the qi of the spleen restrains the qi of the kidneys. The kidneys are the heart’s husband, the liver’s mother, the spleen’s wife, and the lungs’ child. The liver is the spleen’s husband, the heart’s mother, the lungs’ wife, and the kidneys’ child. The heart is the lungs’ husband, the spleen’s mother, the kidneys’ wife, and the liver’s child. The lungs are the liver’s husband, the kidneys’ mother, the heart’s wife, and the spleen’s child. The spleen is the kidneys’ husband, the lungs’ mother, the liver’s wife, and the heart’s child.\n\nThe heart’s manifestations within are the vessels; externally, they appear as complexion, with the tongue as its gateway. It is subdued by the kidneys and directed toward the lungs—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the liver, it flourishes; when it encounters the spleen, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The kidneys’ manifestations within are the bones; externally, they appear as hair, with the ears as its gateway. It is subdued by the spleen and directed toward the heart—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the lungs, it flourishes; when it encounters the liver, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The liver’s manifestations within are the sinews; externally, they appear as nails, with the eyes as its gateway. It is subdued by the lungs and directed toward the spleen—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it encounters the kidneys, it flourishes; when it encounters the heart, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The lungs’ manifestations within are the skin; externally, they appear as fur, with the nostrils as its gateway. It is subdued by the heart and directed toward the liver—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the spleen, it flourishes; when it encounters the kidneys, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. The spleen’s manifestations within are the viscera, nourishing the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Externally, they appear as flesh, with the lips and mouth as its gateway. Its inhalation and exhalation are regulated; it is subdued by the liver and directed toward the kidneys—this follows the logic of husband-wife. When it receives from the heart, it flourishes; when it encounters the lungs, it wanes—this follows the logic of mother-child. Thus, the Five Phases in the human body generate and restrain one another, transmitting qi as husband-wife and mother-child, revealing their waxing and waning here.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The heart is Fire—how does Fire descend? The kidneys are Water—how does Water ascend? The spleen is Earth. Earth, being central, supports Fire and yet inevitably restrains Water below. The lungs are Metal. Metal, being above, interfaces with Fire below and thus is diminished—how then can Water be generated? Those that generate are separated by intervals, while those that restrain are close and difficult to shift. How can these Five Phases, which inherently harm and restrain one another, be reconciled?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The Five Phases return to their origins, linked by a single qi. The primal yang ascends and refines true Water; true Water undergoes transformation and generates true qi; true qi undergoes transformation and generates the yang spirit. Initially, the Five Phases are positioned, establishing one husband and one wife. The kidneys are Water, yet Water contains Metal. Though Metal generates Water, when descending, one must recognize the Metal within Water. Water inherently resists Earth, so after gathering medicine, one must return Earth to Water.\n\nThe dragon is the liver’s symbol, the tiger the lungs’ form. The yang dragon emerges from the *Lí* mansion, the yin tiger arises from the *Kǎn* position. The Five Phases move in reverse. Qi is transmitted to the mother. From *Zǐ* to *Wǔ*, this is called ‘yang time generating yang’—the Five Phases invert, and fluids flow between husband and wife. From *Wǔ* to *Zǐ*, this is called ‘refining yang within yin.’ Yang cannot form without yin, and ultimately, without yin, there is no death. Yin cannot generate without yang, and ultimately, without yang, life is prolonged.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The Five Phases originate from the unity of yin and yang qi. What is meant by ‘one qi’?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"This one qi—when father and mother unite, their essence and blood transform to form shape. The kidneys generate the spleen, the spleen generates the liver, the liver generates the lungs, the lungs generate the heart, the heart generates the small intestine, the small intestine generates the large intestine, the large intestine generates the gallbladder, the gallbladder generates the stomach, and the stomach generates the bladder. This is how yin, through essence and blood, transforms to form shape. Its yang remains at the origin of its initial generation—a single point of primal yang residing in the two kidneys.\n\nMoreover, the kidneys are Water, yet Water contains Fire. This Fire ascends as qi, and through qi, it ascends to meet the heart. The heart is yang; combining yang with yang, the *Tàijí* generates yin, accumulating qi to produce fluids. The fluids descend from the heart and, through fluids, descend back to the kidneys. The liver is originally the heart’s mother and the kidneys’ child, transmitting the kidneys’ qi to the heart. The lungs are originally the heart’s wife and the kidneys’ mother, transmitting the heart’s fluids to the kidneys. Thus, the ascent and descent of qi and fluids mirror the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**Discourse on Water and Fire, Section Seven**\n\nLü said: *\"For one who seeks longevity, the refining of the Golden Elixir is the path. To refine the Golden Elixir, one must first obtain the Yellow Sprout. To obtain the Yellow Sprout, one must first secure the Dragon and Tiger. As they say, the true Dragon emerges from the *Lí* Palace, and the true Tiger arises from the *Kǎn* position. Within *Lí* and *Kǎn*, there is water and fire. But what do these water and fire refer to?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"All within the body that is spoken of as water—such as the Four Seas, Five Lakes, Nine Rivers, Three Islands, the Hua Pool, Yao Pool, Phoenix Pool, Heavenly Pool, Royal Pool, Kun Pool, Yuan Pond, Lang Gardens, Divine Water, Golden Waves, Jade Dew, Jade Spring, Yang Ruxiao (lit. 'yang suet'), and White Snow—these are the names, and they cannot be fully enumerated. All within the body that is spoken of as fire are but the Sovereign Fire, Ministerial Fire, and Common Fire. These three fires take their root in the Original Yang, and from it arises the True Qi. When True Qi gathers, one attains peace; when True Qi weakens, one falls ill. If one dissipates True Qi and flees Original Yang, when Original Yang is exhausted and Pure Yang remains, the Original Spirit departs the body—then one is said to die.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"Within the human body, from a single point of Original Yang, the three fires emerge. These three fires arise from the myriad waters and dense yin, easily dissipated yet difficult to ignite. When this yang is weak and yin is strong, fire is scarce and water is abundant, causing one to decline swiftly and fail to attain longevity. How then does one address this?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"The Heart is the Sea of Blood, the Kidneys the Sea of Qi, the Brain the Sea of Marrow, and the Spleen-Stomach the Sea of Water and Grain—such are these Four Seas. The Five Viscera each possess their own fluids, governing their respective positions east, west, south, north, and center—such are these Five Lakes. The Small Intestine, twenty-four feet long and winding nine times above and below, is called the Nine Rivers; beneath it lies the Yuan Pond. The forehead is the Upper Island, the heart the Central Island, and the kidneys the Lower Island—within these Three Islands lie the roots and Lang Gardens. The Hua Pool lies beneath the Yellow Court, the Yao Pool emerges before the Elixir Gate, the Kun Pool ascends to meet the Jade Capital, the Heavenly Pool aligns with the Inner Palace, the Phoenix Pool is between the Heart and Lungs, and the Jade Pool lies within the lips and teeth. Divine Water is generated within the Qi, and Golden Waves descend from Heaven. Where the Vermilion Dragon resides, there are naturally Jade Dew and Jade Springs. Only after the fetal transformation is complete does one see White Snow and Yang Ruxiao. Nourishment has its seasons; when the flames are strong, one first calls it Jade Dew, then Golden Dew—both can restore the Elixir. Oil is added in measure, in response to bathing: first called Zhōng Tián (lit. 'Central Field'), then Xià Tián (lit. 'Lower Field')—both can refine the form. Jade Medicine and Golden Flowers transmute into the Yellow and White substances; the clarified butter and sweet dew are refined into wondrous fragrances.\n\nSuch are the functions of water. As for the Common Fire ascending to aid the Kidney-Qi in generating True Water; when Kidney-Water ascends to merge with Heart-Fluids and produce True Qi—then in its lesser application, it subdues demons and dispels illness, and in its greater, it refines the substance and ignites the Elixir. When the Microcosmic Orbit is employed, Fire rises to consume the body; when the Yang Barrier is constrained, one returns to the Original Elixir-Medicine. Distinguishing the Nine Regions’ influence nourishes the Yang-Spirit; burning the Three Corpses’ burdens dispels the Yin-Ghosts. Ascending, it strikes the Three Passes; descending, it erodes the Seven Souls. Refining the form into Qi enables flight as though weightless; refining Qi into Spirit allows shedding the body like a serpent’s molt. Such are the functions of Fire.\"*",

The heart Fluids are difficult to accumulate but easily lost—this is the True Dragon. Though the *Dan* scriptures number ten thousand volumes, their debates never stray beyond yin and yang. Yet within these two principles, all essence lies in the Dragon and Tiger. Among those who follow the Dao, only one or two in ten thousand truly grasp it. Some, through vast learning and memorization, may know the principles of Dragon and Tiger, yet fail to recognize their union or the method of refining them. Thus, sages past and present, though they devote their lives to cultivation, achieve only minor success. Generations pass with prolonged lifespans, yet none attain transcendence.

When yang is excessive and yin deficient, one treats with coolness. When yin is excessive and yang deficient, one treats with warmth. The elderly tend to cold, the young to heat; the obese to phlegm, the emaciated to stagnation. Men’s diseases arise from *qi*, women’s from blood. Replenish the deficient and reduce the excessive; preserve the weak and diminish the surplus. Minor cases may be treated with acupuncture and moxibustion; severe cases with medicinal decoctions.

      "translated_text": "When the Great Elixir is complete, the Yang Spirit emerges, and there is a body beyond the body—like a cicada shedding its husk.\n\nThis internal elixir originates from the union of Dragon and Tiger, transforming into a yellow sprout. When the yellow sprout matures, lead and mercury are refined.\n\n**From *Zhong Lü Transmission of the Dao Collection*, Treatise on Lead and Mercury (10):**\nLü said: *\"The internal elixir does not depart from Dragon and Tiger. The Tiger emerges from the Kan palace—this is the water within Qi. The Dragon emerges from the Li palace—this is the Qi within water. External alchemy takes mercury from sand, likening it to the Yang Dragon. It uses silver from lead, likening it to the Yin Tiger. But if lead and mercury are external elixirs, how does the union of Dragon and Tiger produce the yellow sprout, which then refines into lead and mercury? What is meant by the lead and mercury within the internal elixir?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"The one that embraces the essence of Heavenly Unity and stands as the foremost of the five metals is black lead. Lead generates silver—lead is the mother of silver. Touched by the essence of the Great Yang, it becomes the foremost of all stones—this is cinnabar. Cinnabar generates mercury—mercury is the child of cinnabar. The difficult ones to obtain are silver from lead and mercury from cinnabar. If silver and mercury unite, through refining they naturally become the supreme treasure. This is the external logic of lead and mercury.\n\nBut speaking of internal matters, what is seen in humanity—ancient and modern debates differ greatly. Taking the profound and mysterious account: it originates from the moment of parental union, when essence and blood merge, enclosing True Qi, lodged in the mother’s pure Yin palace, with Spirit hidden before yin-yang differentiation. At three hundred days, the embryo is complete; at five thousand days, the Qi is full.\n\nSpeaking in terms of the Five Phases, the human body is fundamentally essence and blood—water precedes all. Speaking in terms of the Five Organs, essence and blood form the shape, with the kidneys first emerging. Within the kidney water lies concealed the initial parental True Qi of conception. This True Qi is hidden in the inner kidneys—this is what is called lead. The Qi generated by the kidneys, the True Unity water within Qi, is called True Tiger—this is the silver within lead.\n\nKidney Qi passes to Liver Qi, which passes to Heart Qi. Heart Qi, reaching the Great Polarity, generates fluids. Within the fluid is the Pure Yang Qi—this is cinnabar. Mercury is the Pure Yang Qi within the heart fluid. Qi and fluid accumulate into the fetal sac, transmitted within the Yellow Court. Fire is applied without error, and the Embryonic Immortal transforms naturally—this is when lead and silver merge with mercury, refined into treasure.\"\n\nLü said: *\"Among the five metals, silver is taken from lead. Among the eight minerals, mercury is extracted from cinnabar. Placed in the crucible, combined with elixirs, mercury becomes cinnabar and silver becomes treasure. But in humanity, how does one extract silver from lead? How does one extract mercury from cinnabar? How does mercury become cinnabar? How does silver become treasure?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"Lead is the original True Qi of parents united into one, pure and inseparable. After forming, it is stored in the kidneys. The two kidneys face each other, ascending together as Qi—this is called Original Yang Qi. Within the Qi is True Unity water. Water ascends with Qi, and where Qi lingers, water lingers; where Qi scatters, water scatters. This water and Qi, like mother and child, never separate. The adept sees only Qi, not water.\n\nIf this True Unity water is united with the Pure Yang Qi of the heart, this is called the union of Dragon and Tiger, transforming into the yellow sprout. The yellow sprout is the Great Elixir—its material is fundamentally True Unity water as the embryo, internally containing Pure Yang Qi, just as the original parental True Qi, with essence and blood forming the fetal sac. Through the processes of transformation, at three hundred days the embryo is complete, Qi is full, and form and Spirit are perfected, separating from the mother.\n\nAfter the outer form unites, union generates form. Those who follow the Dao—when kidney Qi unites with heart Qi, the Qi contains True Unity water bearing Pure Yang Qi, and Qi unites with water to form the fetal sac, resembling millet grains, nurtured without deficiency. Initially, Yin retains Yang; then, Yang refines Yin. Qi transforms into essence, essence into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, and cinnabar into Golden Elixir. When the Golden Elixir is complete, True Qi spontaneously arises, refining Qi into Spirit and achieving transcendence. The Fire Dragon departs from the murky world, riding the Dark Crane into Penglai Isle.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"When form unites with form, form generates form. When Qi unites with Qi, Qi generates Qi—this cycle does not exceed three hundred days. After separation of form, how do the differing shapes of male and female resemble the colors of cinnabar and lead?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"When parental forms unite, the father’s essence enters first, followed by the mother’s blood, with blood enveloping essence to form the female. The female is internally Yang and externally Yin, symbolizing the mother—since blood is external. If the mother’s blood enters first, followed by the father’s essence, with essence enveloping blood to form the male, the male is internally Yin and externally Yang, symbolizing the father—since essence is external.\n\nThis blood originates from the heart and lacks Pure Yang Qi. This essence originates from the kidneys and contains Pure Yang Qi. Pure Yang Qi is the root of mercury—this is the True Unity water merging and entering the Yellow Court. Mercury is boiled with lead’s decoction, and lead is simmered with mercury’s fire. Lead without mercury cannot release True Unity water. Mercury without lead cannot transform into Pure Yang Qi.\"*",

      "translated_text": "On the Principle of Extraction and Replenishment (Eleventh Discourse)\n\nLü said: *\"The gathering of elixir relies upon the water within the Qi. Advancing the fire requires borrowing the Qi from within the lead. Ultimately, extracting lead yields the Great Elixir. If one then replenishes mercury, it can supplement the Dantian above. What is the meaning of this principle of extraction and replenishment?\"*\n\nZhong replied: *\"In ancient times, the Most High Sage transmitted the Dao to the mortal realm. The people of the Primeval Age were pure and returned to simplicity, unaware, and thus unable to hear the Great Dao. Heaven and Earth pointed to the proper rise and fall of Yin and Yang, exchanging through the Qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, while seasons followed their appointed rhythms. The cycles of the year were fixed, returning endlessly without deviation from the Dao—this is why Heaven and Earth endure.\n\nThey did not consider that mortals might fail to comprehend, so they revealed the Great Principle, yet it remained obscured in one corner. Next, they spoke of the interplay of the Sun and Moon’s essence, advancing and retreating at dawn, noon, and the waxing and waning phases, appearing and vanishing without error. The months completed their full count, their course unending, never deviating from the Dao—this is why the Sun and Moon endure.\n\nYet when cold gives way to heat and heat to cold, mortals fail to awaken to the proper rise and fall of Heaven and Earth. When the Moon waxes full and then wanes, when it wanes and then waxes full again, mortals do not grasp the interplay of Sun and Moon. They indulge in boundless desires, wasting their finite time.\n\nWealth and luxury adorn the fleeting dream of life, while love and affection bring only endless troubles—ultimately, they repay the debt of mortal existence. The songs have not yet faded when suffering arrives, and when fame and gain are at their height, youth has already departed. Greed for riches and goods leads one to believe that the myriad kalpas will endure, while fondness for children and grandchildren makes them hope for eternal reunion. Yet clinging and delusion never cease, draining the Original Yang and losing True Qi.\n\nThus, they fall ill with dire diseases, only to meet their end when the heart finally rests. When the Great Limit approaches, they realize it is too late. The True Immortals and Most High Sages pity such endless cycles of decline, yet mortals still fall back into decay. They deeply wish for mortals to awaken to the Great Dao, to endure as Heaven and Earth, and as Sun and Moon do.\n\nAt first, they expounded the rise and fall of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang. Then, they illustrated the interplay of the Sun and Moon’s essence. Yet mortals do not perceive the heavenly mechanism or fathom the profound mysteries.\n\nComparing inner elixirs to outer elixirs, and speaking of lifeless things to illustrate the living: lifeless are gold and stone; gold and stone are outer elixirs. The living are Qi and fluids; Qi and fluids are inner elixirs. Great as Heaven and Earth, bright as Sun and Moon, outer as gold and stone, inner as Qi and fluids.\n\nOnce gathered, one must replenish; once replenished, one must extract. The principle of extraction and replenishment is the very root of transformation.\n\nAfter the Winter Solstice, Yang rises from Earth, and Earth extracts its Yin. When the Great Yin is extracted, it becomes the Reclusive Yin; when the Lesser Yang is replenished, it becomes the Bright Yang. If the Reclusive Yin is not extracted, it becomes the Lesser Yin; if the Bright Yang is not replenished, it becomes the Great Yang. Otherwise, there would be no transition from cold to warmth, or from warmth to heat.\n\nAfter the Summer Solstice, Yin descends from Heaven, and Heaven extracts its Yang. When the Great Yang is extracted, it becomes the Bright Yang; when the Lesser Yin is replenished, it becomes the Reclusive Yin. If the Bright Yang is not extracted, it becomes the Lesser Yang; if the Reclusive Yin is not replenished, it becomes the Great Yin. Otherwise, there would be no transition from heat to coolness, or from coolness to cold.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth’s rise and fall of Yin and Yang transform into the Six Qi—this is the proof of extraction and replenishment.\n\nWhen the Moon receives the Sun’s spirit, the Sun’s essence becomes the Moon’s shadow. In the first fifteen days, the Moon extracts its shadow while the Sun replenishes its spirit, so the essence is full and its light shines above and below. Otherwise, there would be no progression from the New Moon to the Upper Crescent, or from the Upper Crescent to the Full Moon.\n\nWhen the Moon returns to its Yin shadow, and the Sun collects its Yang essence, in the latter fifteen days, the Sun extracts its spirit while the Moon replenishes its shadow. The light has already waned, and the Yin shadow is full. Otherwise, there would be no transition from the Full Moon to the Lower Crescent, or from the Lower Crescent to the Dark Moon.\n\nThus, the Sun and Moon’s reciprocal rise and fall transform into the Nine Six phases—this is the proof of extraction and replenishment.\n\nMortals do not perceive the heavenly mechanism or fathom the profound mysteries. The True Immortals and Most High Sages, seeing what mortals love as the cause of illness and death, urge them to refine gold and stone into the Great Elixir. They take what mortals desire—yellow gold and white silver—and use lead and mercury to forge the Supreme Treasure. Their intent is for mortals to awaken to the Great Principle.\n\nThe lifeless gold and stone require no precise fire or timing; extraction and replenishment follow a set count, and yet they can still extend life and years. But if one uses the living essence of one’s own body—the True One’s Yang Qi, the True One’s water—and knows the times of union and the methods of gathering, accumulating day by day and month by month, so that Qi contains Qi, refining Qi into Spirit to attain transcendence, it is indeed a rare and difficult matter in ancient and modern times.\n\nFew in the mortal or celestial realms attain enlightenment. Those who do must cultivate a resolute mind, abandon worldly affairs, and emulate the enduring nature of Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon. They guide the lost and urge them to focus on the Dao, which is why there is the teaching of outer elixirs.\n\nThe sages of past and present have expounded these methods, and their words have reached the world. Yet mortals still fail to awaken, deceiving themselves and others, and thus losing the original intent of the ancient masters.\"",

      "translated_text": "The alchemists take sand to obtain mercury, and with mercury they stain lead, which then absorbs the mercury. They use mercury to transmute copper, disregarding life and limb in their frenzied pursuit of wealth. Mutual promotion ensues, with the pretense of seeking the Dao, yet truly coveting profit, their ambition fixed on the arts of yellow and white elixirs.\n\nThe ancient sages and transcendent immortals, unable to reveal the truth outright, spoke in parables, teaching through the metaphor of external lead and mercury to hint at inner matters. Even inanimate gold and stone—objects without sentience—can be transformed into treasure through the workings of *造化* (Creation-Transformation). How much more so then for the sentient self, where substances like lead and mercury arise from one’s own essence! If such substances can be refined and transmuted, then why not also produce the divine elixir?\n\nThose who follow the Dao must delve deeply into its mysteries and not cling to the external arts of elixir-forging or the furnaces of alchemy. Indeed, when humans speak of \"external lead\" and \"external mercury,\" they refer to substances extracted from gold and stone, which can be refined into treasure. But the true lead is the primordial *真气* (True Qi) stored within one’s own kidneys—the essence of one’s parents—while the true mercury is the refined essence born from the union of *真一* (True Unity) and *正阳* (Right Yang) *之气* (Qi).\n\nRefining and transmuting this lead and mercury can generate the Spirit. This is what is called *真铅* (True Lead) and *真汞* (True Mercury)—do they too require refining and transmuting? Master Zhōng replied:\n\n\"At first, obtaining mercury requires lead, but using lead is ultimately in error. Thus, one must refine it to enter the Upper Palace, where the Original Qi does not pass through. Then, returning the essence to nourish the brain, one attains daily mercury, with Yin exhausted and Yang pure. The essence transforms into sand, and the sand into gold, which is then called *真铅* (True Lead). True Lead arises from the True Qi within oneself, merging to produce the *真一* (True Unity) and the *正阳* (Right Yang) *之水* (water).\n\nWhen the Five Qi converge at the Original, the Three Yang gather at the Crown, the True Lead ascends to the Inner Treasury and emits a radiant white light. From below to above, from above to below—returning the elixir and refining the form—all are functions of the True Lead’s cyclical movement. From front to back, from back to front—burning the body and uniting the Qi—all are the work of True Qi’s Creation-Transformation.\n\nIf one merely refines without extracting or transmutes without supplementing, remaining content with daily practices, how could one ever gather herbs, stoke the fire, and hope for such miraculous efficacy?\"\n\nMaster Lǚ asked: \"How does one ensure proper extraction and supplementation, so that the ascent and descent are measured, and the front and back remain without discrepancy?\"\n\nMaster Zhōng replied: \"At the time when it can be ascended, it must not be descended; when it can be extracted, it must not be supplemented. The movements of ascent and descent must be without the slightest error—this is the power of the *河车* (River Vehicle).\" The Dao was transmitted between Zhōng and Lǚ.",

      "translated_text": "**Discourse on the River Vehicle (Chapter Twelve)**\n\nMaster Lǚ asked: *\"What is meant by the 'River Vehicle'?\"*\n\nMaster Zhōng replied: *\"In ancient times, a wise man observed how floating clouds could block the sun and provide shade, and thus conceived the idea of a roof. He saw fallen leaves drifting on the water and thought of crafting a boat to carry things. Observing how dandelion seeds (piāopéng) drift with the wind, turning endlessly without rest, he then fashioned a chariot. Now, a chariot—its axle represents the heavens and earth, its revolving wheels mirror the sun and moon. High Daoists drew their analogy from chariots, for chariots move upon the earth and turn upon land. But the River Vehicle has its own explanation: within the human body, Yang is scarce while Yin is abundant, and water is prevalent. The chariot symbolizes transport, while the river embodies the abundance of Yin. Thus, this River Vehicle does not move upon the earth but upon the waters. From above to below, sometimes forward, sometimes backward, it carries its load within the Eight Precious (jīn) and traverses the Four Seas. Ascending to the heavens, it enters Kunlun; having crossed, it descends to the Phoenix Gate. It transports the Primordial Yang straight into the Palace of Separation (Lí Gōng); it conveys True Qi and returns it to the Hall of Longevity. It travels through the Nine Regions without pause; it circulates the Three Mountains without rest. When the Dragon and Tiger unite, it commands the Yellow Woman to enter the Yellow Court; when Lead and Mercury are divided, it entrusts the Golden Boy to carry them to the Golden Gate. The Thousand Springs of Jade flow, yet their movement halts in half a moment’s work; the Golden Elixir is transported in but a fleeting instant. Without this Vehicle to transport the Five Phases, they could never coalesce into a unified Qi. Without this Vehicle, how could they unite? To act in accordance with the seasons and times, one must rely on this Vehicle to transport them—only then will there be efficacy. The cultivation of Yang and the refining of Yin must depend on this Vehicle to transport them, only then will there be no discrepancy. Before Heaven and Earth are perfected, the Vehicle circulates their pure Qi, drawing in the Primordial Yang of the Original Palace. From the mundane to the sage, it transports the true and genuine Qi of Yin and Yang, refining and supplementing the Original Spirit of the body—its merits cannot be fully enumerated.\"*\n\nMaster Lǚ asked: *\"The River Vehicle possesses such wondrous functions. May I inquire: what within the human body constitutes this Vehicle? Once obtained, how is it employed?\"*",

Just as the Original Yang (乾) seeks the Original Yin (坤) to produce the Water Trigram (坎)—Water being the essence of Yin—when the Yang has sought the Yin, it returns, carrying the Yin back to its place, passing through the Earth (艮), Thunder (震), and Wind (巽) trigrams. By seeking the Yin with the Yang, and through the Yin extracting the Yin, it transports the essence into the Fire Trigram (離), where the Yang is received and generates life. This is the River Vehicle transporting Yin into the Yang Palace (陽宮).\n\nAnd when the Original Yin (坤) seeks the Original Yang (乾) to produce the Fire Trigram (離)—Fire being the essence of Yang—once the Yin has sought the Yang, it returns, embracing the Yang and restoring its place, passing through the Earth (艮), Lake (兌), and Heaven (乾) trigrams. By seeking the Yang with the Yin, and through the Yin extracting the Yang, it transports the essence into the Water Trigram (坎), where the Yin is received and generates life. This is the River Vehicle transporting Yang into the Yin Palace (陰官).\n\nFurthermore, when gathering medicinal herbs from the Nine Palaces (九宮), one obtains them and descends into the Yellow Court (黃庭). When extracting lead from beneath the Crooked River (曲江), one transports it upward into the Inner Palace (內院). The Jade Elixir (玉液) and Gold Elixir (金液) are the Original Elixir (還丹); their transportation can refine the form and enable the water to ascend. The Sovereign’s Fire (君火) and the Common Fire (民火) are used for refining the form; their transportation can burn the elixir and cause the fire to descend.\n\nThe Five Qi (五氣) return to their source, each with its appointed time for transportation. The Three Flowers (三花) gather at the crown, each with its specific day for transportation. When the Spirit (神) gathers, demons arise; if one transports the true fire to consume the body, the Three Corpses (三尸) vanish.

In silent accord with inverted techniques, when the Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout—this is the Small River Vehicle. When the Elbow-Post Flying Gold Crystal ascends and the crystal returns to the Cinnabar Field, when lead is extracted and mercury added to form the Great Medicine—this is the Great River Vehicle. The Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout; lead and mercury unite to form the Great Medicine.\n\nWhen true qi arises, the Five Qi return to the Central Primordial Yang; when the Three Spirits gather, they transcend the Inner Palace. When the Purple-Gold Elixir is complete, it remains like the Dark Cranes flying in pairs; when the White Jade Mercury is refined, it surges like the Fire Dragon rising. Golden radiance in ten thousand streams envelops the vulgar bones with brilliance; a single Qí-tree blooms with fresh blossoms, dazzling in splendor.\n\nSometimes it emerges, sometimes it enters—each emergence and entry amplifies itself; sometimes it departs, sometimes it returns—its comings and goings are unobstructed. When the Spirit is transported into the body and mingles with the flowing times, it transforms the Sage, separating from the mundane, becoming a Feathered Immortal. Thus it is called the Purple River Vehicle.\n\nThese are the names of the Three Vehicles, divided into upper, middle, and lower realms. Hence, they are called Three Realizations—not like the Buddhist Three Vehicles: the Sheep Vehicle, the Deer Vehicle, and the Great Ox Vehicle.\n\nSpeaking in terms of the Dao, after the River Vehicle, there are three more: those who gather fire and direct their mind and intention to assault illnesses are called the Messenger Vehicle. Those who have already achieved harmony, descending from above, with yin and yang perfectly aligned, where water and fire coexist, and within stillness, the sound of thunder resounds—these are the Thunder Vehicles. If the mind is enslaved by external things, if emotions are dragged by external forces, and one is scattered by external influences, depleting the true yang qi from without to within, without rest, until qi weakens and the body becomes emaciated, leading to decay and old age—then, if one contracts the Five Epidemics and struggles to transport true qi, the Primordial Yang cannot withstand it, and one dies old and sick—this is called the Broken Vehicle.\"*\n\nLü said, *\"When the Five Phases invert and the Dragon and Tiger unite, the Small River Vehicle is already in motion.

      "translated_text": "**On the Cultivation of Form (Chapter Fourteen)**\n\nLü said: *\"Since the art of returning the elixir is now understood, may I inquire about the principles of cultivating the form?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"In human birth, form and spirit are as yin and yang—one the exterior, the other the interior. Spirit is the master of form; form is the dwelling of spirit. Within form, essence generates qi, and qi generates spirit. Within the fluids, qi is born; within qi, fluids are born—this is the child-mother relationship of form.\n\nWater generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, and metal generates water. Qi flows in the child-mother cycle while fluids move in the husband-wife cycle—this is the yin-yang of form. Water transforms into fluids, fluids into blood, and blood into vital essence (jīn), by which yin obtains yang and life is produced. If yin and yang are misaligned, then tears, mucus, saliva, and sweat overflow, and yin loses its capacity to generate.\n\nQi transforms into essence, essence into pearls, pearls into mercury, and mercury into sand—by which yang obtains yin and completion is achieved. If yin and yang are misaligned, then illness, aging, death, and suffering arise, and yang cannot attain fulfillment.\n\nYin without yang does not generate; yang without yin does not complete. Those who follow the Dao cultivate yang but not yin, refine themselves but not external things. At the moment of birth, when the breath first enters, the true qi of one’s parents is divided and lodges within the embryo, nurtured in the mother’s purely yin palace. Within yin, yin is generated; through form, form is created. When the fetus is complete and the breath is full, the six-foot frame is entirely yin, with only a trace of primordial yang.\n\nTo seek eternal life and not die, one must cultivate the form to remain in the world across countless kalpas. To transcend the mundane and attain sainthood, one must cultivate the form to transform qi, thereby gaining an additional body beyond the physical.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"The form is yin, and yin has substance. To make the substantial insubstantial—to transform the form into qi and thus abandon the mundane body to enter the ranks of the sages—this is the highest method of cultivation. To retain qi within the form and use qi to nourish the form: in small measure, it brings comfort and longevity; in great measure, it still allows one to dwell in the world. For the aged, it reverses decay and restores youth; for the young, it preserves complexion and extends life. Taking thirty-six thousand years as one age, two hundred sixty thousand ages as one kalpa, and three hundred sixty thousand kalpas as one great kalpa—within such vast kalpas, time is unknown, yet one endures alongside heaven and earth. But if these principles of cultivation and the mechanisms of transformation yield such results, may I hear them explained?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"When the form is complete, the fetus is formed in three hundred days. After birth, the breath is full in five thousand days. The five-foot-five-inch stature corresponds to the five phases of creation. Some may vary in size, but proportions are measured by the inch—length and breadth must align appropriately.\n\nAbove the heart lies the Nine Heavens; below the heart lies the Nine Earths. From the kidneys to the heart is eight inches and four divisions. From the heart to the first ring of the *chónglóu* (double pavilion) is eight inches and four divisions. From the first ring of the *chónglóu* to the crown is eight inches and four divisions. Thus, from the kidneys to the crown, it totals two feet, five inches, and two divisions. The primordial qi fills this space in a day and night, completing a full cycle of three hundred twenty degrees. Each degree measures two feet, five inches, and two divisions, totaling eighty-one zhang (丈). The primordial qi aligns with the ninefold, ninefold celestial yang, while the distance between the kidneys and heart harmonizes with the natural separation of heaven and earth.\n\nFrom the kidneys to the crown, the span is two feet, five inches. Additionally, according to the fivefold, fivefold pure yang of the Five Phases, the primordial qi emerges with each inhalation. Once released, the *róng* (nutritive) and *wèi* (defensive) circulate freely, drawing the true qi of heaven and earth. They respond to the seasons, sometimes merging, sometimes diverging, endlessly measuring zhang and chǐ. With each exhalation, the qi returns. Upon entering, the meridians and collaterals open. One inhalation and exhalation—this is the true qi of heaven, earth, and humanity coursing through the twelve rings (of the *chónglóu*). Its ebb and flow are called one breath. In a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths: thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations, drawing one’s own primordial qi from within; thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations, drawing the true qi of heaven and earth from without.\n\nIf the roots are firm and the primordial qi undiminished, then during each breath, one can seize the true qi of heaven and earth. By refining qi with qi, it permeates the Four Great Elements (四大). The pure nourishes the *róng*, while the turbid nourishes the *wèi*, all flowing freely. The vertical courses through the meridians, the horizontal through the collaterals, all expanding without obstruction. Cold and heat cannot harm, labor and toil cannot threaten—light body, strong bones, clear qi, and tranquil spirit. One eternally preserves boundless life and becomes a perpetually youthful being.\n\nBut if the roots are not firm, the essence exhausted, and the qi weak, then above, the breath has already been dissipated, and below, the original palace lacks replenishment. The drawn qi of heaven and earth surges out, while eighty-one zhang of primordial qi are depleted in the ninefold cycle. Instead of becoming one’s own, it is taken by heaven and earth—how could such a one seize the true qi of heaven and earth? When yin accumulates and yang declines, the qi weakens and disease arises; when the qi is exhausted, death follows, and one falls into the wheel of rebirth.\"*\n\nLü said: *\"How does one prevent the primordial qi from dispersing, so that through cultivating the form, one may seize the true qi of heaven and earth and endure through the great kalpas?\"*\n\nZhōng replied: *\"To conquer, one must first strengthen one’s forces.\"*",

essence of Water and Fire,\nknowing that the Dragon and Tiger do not arise from the liver and lungs.\nI examine the principles of extraction and addition,\nand verify that lead and mercury are not the same as the trigrams **Kàn** (☵) and **Lí** (☲).\nThe calculations of the Five Phases in reverse are already revealed to me,\nand the mechanics of the Three Fields' return are now laid bare.\nI am thoroughly familiar with the logic of refining the form with Elixir,\nand deeply comprehend the art of eternal longevity.\n\nYet the origin of transcending the mundane to become a Sage,\nthe Dao of shedding the physical to ascend as an Immortal,\nrests upon refining the Qi and attaining the **Primordial Return** (Cháo Yuán).\nAs for the **Primordial Return**, I dare to impart its essential instructions.\"*\n\n Zhōng said: *\"The Dao is formless by nature,\nbut **Tàiyuān** (太原) demonstrates simplicity.\nAbove, it is pure; below, it is turbid,\nyet it contains both as one.\nWhen **Tàijí** (太极) divides,\n**Hùndùn** (混沌) first separates to form Heaven and Earth,\nand within Heaven and Earth, the Five Directions—east, west, south, north, and center—are arrayed.\nEach Direction has its own Sovereign,\neach Sovereign has two children:\none is Yang, the other is Yin.\nThus, the two **Qi** (vital energies) generate and complete each other,\nforming the Five Phases.\nThe Five Phases generate and complete each other,\nestablishing the Six Qi.\nHence, the Three Yin and Three Yang arise.\nFrom this, one may infer:\nAt the very beginning of conception,\nthe vital essence is undivided as one.\nOnce the essence differentiates,\nthe two kidneys first emerge.\nThe left kidney, associated with **Xuán** (玄, \"mysterious\"),\nascends the Qi and transmits it upward to the liver.\nThe right kidney, associated with **Pìn** (牝, \"feminine\"),\nreceives the fluids and transmits them downward to the bladder.\n**Xuán** and **Pìn** originate from the **void within** (無中),\ntransforming the **non-existent into the existent** (以無為有).\nThis is the true essence of the parents.\nWhen it is received in the realm of pure Yin,\nit is called the **Spirit of the Valley** (谷神不死),\nthe **Gate of Mysterious Feminine** (玄牝之門),\ncomparable to the **Root of Heaven and Earth** (天地之根).\n**Xuán** and **Pìn** are the two kidneys,\nfrom which the five Zàng (solid) organs and six Fǔ (hollow) organs all derive.\nWithin them:\nThe liver, as wood, is **Jiǎ-Yǐ** (甲乙),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the East, Qīngdì** (青帝).\nThe heart, as fire, is **Bǐng-Dīng** (丙丁),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the South, Chìdì** (赤帝).\nThe lungs, as metal, are **Gēng-Xīn** (庚辛),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the West, Báidì** (白帝).\nThe spleen, as earth, is **Wù-Jǐ** (戊己),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the Center, Huángdì** (黃帝).\nThe kidneys, as water, are **Rén-Gǔi** (壬癸),\ncomparable to the **Sovereign of the North, Hēidì** (黑帝).\nAt birth, humans lack form,\nexisting merely as one Yin and one Yang.\nOnce the embryo is complete,\nthe intestines and stomach form,\nand the Six Qi are divided—three male, three female.\nOne Qi governs the Five Phases,\nthe Five Phases govern the Six Qi.\nFirst, one must recognize Yin and Yang,\nwhereby Yang contains **Yin-within-Yang** (阴中阳),\nand Yin contains **Yang-within-Yin** (陽中陰).\nNext, one must recognize the Five Phases—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—\nand their transformations:\nwater containing fire, fire containing water,\nwater containing metal, metal containing wood,\nwood containing fire, fire containing earth.\nThese five mutually interact,\nthus dividing the two Qi into Six Qi,\nand scattering the Great Dao into the Five Phases.\n\nFor example, after the **Winter Solstice** (冬至),\none Yang arises in the Five Directions,\nand all Yang energies ascend.\nOne Sovereign issues the command,\nwhile the other four assist.\nIf, during the spring season,\nthe **Sovereign of the North, Hēidì** (黑帝) fails to withdraw his command,\nthen cold cannot transform into warmth.\nIf the **Sovereign of the South, Chìdì** (赤帝) does not uphold his command,\nthen warmth cannot transform into heat.\nAfter the **Summer Solstice** (夏至),\none Yin arises in the Five Directions of Heaven,\nand all Yin energies descend.\nOne Sovereign issues the decree,\nwhile the other four assist.\nIf, during the autumn season,\nthe **Sovereign of the South, Chìdì** (赤帝) fails to withdraw his decree,\nthen heat cannot transform into coolness.\nIf the **Sovereign of the North, Hēidì** (黑帝) does not uphold his decree,\nthen coolness cannot transform into cold.\n\nAt the **Winter Solstice**, Yang arises from the earth\nand ascends to greet the Qi of Heaven and Earth.\nAt the **Summer Solstice**, Yin arises from Heaven\nand descends to greet the Qi of Heaven and Earth.\nThose who follow the Dao\nshould deeply investigate these principles.\n\nBetween the sun and moon,\nwhen one Yang first arises,\nthe Qi of the five Zàng organs ascend to greet the **Central Primordial** (中元).\nWhen one Yin first arises,\nthe fluids of the five Zàng organs descend to greet the **Lower Primordial** (下元).\nThe **Yin-within-Yang** (阴中之阳),\nthe **Yang-within-Yang** (阳中之阳),\nand the **Yang-within-Yin-and-Yang** (阴阳中之阳)\nascend to greet the **Upper Primordial** (上元),\nwhile the **Spirit of the Heart** (心神) returns to the **Celestial Palace** (天宫).\nThese are all acts of the **Primordial Return**.\"*\n\n Lü said: *\"When Yang arises,\nthe Five Qi ascend to greet the **Central Primordial** (中元).\nWhen Yin

mundane and become a Sage** (超凡入圣),\nto **shed the physical and ascend as an Immortal** (脱质升仙),\none must first allow the **Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎) to copulate\nand produce the **Great Elixir** (大药).\nOnce the **Great Elixir** is formed,\n**True Qi** (真气) arises.\nWhen **True Qi** is born,\nwithin the year, one must use the month,\nand within the month, one must determine growth and

Yet, **retaining visualization** (存想) and **inner observation** (内观) cannot be entirely abandoned—how can one of little learning and no wisdom know the proper time for **copulation** (交合) or grasp the **methods of cultivation** (行持之法)? They merely hope for success through **retaining visualization** (存想), imagining **elixir within the body** (意内成丹) or **extracting medicine from thought** (想中取药). They draw in through the nose and swallow through the mouth, fixating on the tangible **sun and moon** (日月), the **formless heavens and earth** (无为之天地), and attempt to retain them in the abdomen—this is but child’s play! Hence, the **adepts of the Dao** (达士) and **mysterious ones** (奇人), once they discard **sitting in forgetfulness** (坐忘) and **retaining visualization** (存想), are left with nothing but **dreams of wealth** (梦里得财)—how could this suffice?\n\nTo **draw a cake on the ground** (画地为饼) is no remedy for hunger. To **grasp at emptiness within emptiness** (空中又空), like **mirror reflections and watery moons** (如镜花水月), will never yield true substance. Yet there are still aspects worth embracing: those easily moved are but fragments of the heart, those hard to subdue are but single threads of the mind. On favorable days and auspicious times, these may be gathered and refined. Though one knows the **purity of the Dao** (清净之地), the heart is enslaved by worldly affairs, and the resolve is swayed by fleeting emotions. Time passes like **flashes of lightning** (比电光), and every moment is precious—yet the slightest deviation in method leaves one as distant from the Dao as the **heavens from the earth** (天地悬隔). Years and months accumulate, yet no progress is made—this failure stems from a **turbulent heart and frenzied mind** (心乱而意狂).\n\nThose who **fix their gaze well** (善视者) may covet the beauty of **lapis lazuli and cinnabar** (丹青), yet miss the **Great Peak** (泰华). Those who **listen keenly** (善听者) may seek the **true resonance of strings and bamboo** (丝竹真音), yet fail to hear the **thunderous might** (雷霆). Even the senses, so limited in scope, are thus misled—how much more so the **heart-mind**, vast as the **six directions of space** (六合), encompassing all yet never fully grasped!

They meet before the Yellow Hall (黄屋). A yellow-robed elderly woman guides them, observing the rites of mortal couples in perfect joy.

This is the visualization of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir (金液还丹) having reached completion.*\n\n*Or, when dragons and tigers drag their chariots through the fire, surging past the Three Celestial Passes (三关). The Three Passes each have soldiers and officials, numbering countless thousands. Armored warriors and weapons tremble in fear before humanity. First, the dragons and tigers are driven back by force; then, the great fire is lit, and the passes open only when the flames reach their peak—until they reach Kunlun Mountain (昆仑) and only then cease.

East, west, south, and north—all converge harmoniously at Yu Province (豫州) before resuming his journey.

May I inquire further?\"*\n\nZhōng replied, *\"The practitioners of Dao across ages, failing to grasp Heaven’s hidden workings, began without comprehension. They relied on methods, seeking swift transcendence through forced breath retention—holding their breath to excess, eyes closed in inner observation. They halted within stillness, emitting only the yin spirit, thus becoming mere refined ghosts, not pure yang immortals.\n\nTrue immortals and sages, therefore, gather herbs, refine fire, extract lead and add mercury, return the elixir, refine the form, and unite at the Supreme Court. Though I speak at length to awaken the world, few truly understand—least of all the essence of inner observation. Yet this method is the very law of yin-yang transformation, the moment when mortal and immortal diverge.\n\nFor those who follow the Dao, even a slight hint of its use would be invaluable. Consider the earlier practices: their timing and methods are fixed. With sincere devotion and adherence to the law, even minor deviations yield results in due course. But inner observation demands no fixed time or method. One must dwell in profound stillness, day and night, upright and composed, discerning the yang spirit while banishing the yin ghosts.\n\nAs with Bodhidharma’s nine years facing the wall before entering the inner precincts, or the World-Honored One’s six years of silent meditation before escaping the bonds of the mundane—so too is inner observation a formidable challenge.\n\nAt first, one descends from above, transporting the *zǐhéchē* (purple river vehicle) into the Celestial Palace. Its wealth and grandeur—who would not admire? The comings and goings, the opulence and excess, the unseen wonders—all belong to the practitioner. Yet those who follow the Dao, accustomed to quietude and detachment, having long endured solitude, find fulfillment when their merit is complete. Towers of jade and pearl, female musicians and melodious pipes, rare delicacies and exotic flowers—every sight is vivid as day. The unenlightened mistake this for the true Celestial Palace, unaware that their own inner realm is mistaken for reality.\n\nIf they linger without entering or exiting, they become trapped in the murky crossroads, their form bound to the world, unable to transcend flesh for immortality. They have not yet reached the Celestial Palace—they remain in inner observation.\n\nThe yin ghosts and external demons arise from thought, which shapes illusions, which in turn create false realms—these are the demonic armies. Practitioners, misled, may plunge into madness or fall to external heresies, never attaining immortality. Some, ensnared by the Three Vermin and Seven Spirits, pray only for others’ deaths to satisfy their own desires. The Nine Worms and Six Afflictions torment them, finding no refuge in the living.\n\nThus, Zhōng and Lü transmitted the Dao.\"*",
