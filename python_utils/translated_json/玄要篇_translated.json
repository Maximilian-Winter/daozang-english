  "full_translation": "**Mysterious Essentials: Two Imitations of the Ancient**\n\n**Primordial Qi of the Origin**\nVague and dim, the primordial ancestral qi,\nSimple and turbid, obscure and indistinct.\nIt held the formless within, the first chaos unnamed.\nWhen the undifferentiated split, the Great One breathed forth its sprout.\nThe Two Modes joined in virtue, sun and moon waxed and waned.\nHeaven intermingled with Earth’s transformations, Earth sought Heaven’s completion.\nDifferent names yet one source, a single root shared.\nWithin and without, void and solid, firm and yielding balanced.\nYin and yang divided by principle, change shaped all forms.\nTrue essence, true qi—elusive, profound, and obscure.\nKan and Li inverted, the Five Phases set in motion.\nWhen the hexagram *Jiji* arises, gods are born;\nwhen *Weiji* comes, death draws near.\nThe Dao of immortality is guarded with care,\nwhile the ghostly path inclines toward perversion.\nThose who emulate Heaven’s Way swiftly shun the gates of ghosts.\nBy seeking Heaven through immortality, the eminent Dao endures.\nThe great Dao of Heaven and Earth embraces harmony and holds the center.\nThe mysterious ancestor, the wondrous origin—\nprofound and subtle, it pierces the primordial chaos.\nThe bellows and furnace, the Vermilion Bird scorching the sky,\nthe Metal Direction’s moon appears, the southwest gains its companion.\nLaughing, they pour the dark wine, feasting within the Yellow Center.\nTwo eights achieve perfection, crow and hare merge as one.\nThe divine light is silent, the Yellow Chamber’s venerable elder.\nThe Wind of Xun stirs, the cauldron brims with rosy clouds.\nWater and fire advance and retreat, dawn as *Zhun*, dusk as *Meng*.\nMidnight and noon in motion, dawn and dusk without effect.\nWhen the tenth month’s count is complete,\nthe hexagrams’ symbols reverse and end.\nThe work of destiny is fulfilled, pure yang qi surges.\nThe divine mechanism’s wondrous use—Dao’s methods are boundless.\n\n---\n\n**Ladder to Heaven**\nA wanderer of the Great Origin, drifting like tumbleweed,\nhis whiskers bristling like halberds.\nA single tune ascends the ladder to Heaven,\nworthy of a flying staff through the void.\nRecalling the start of my Dao-seeking,\nmy heart remained unshaken as stone.\nI abandoned office to roam seas and mountains,\ntoiling in search of the elixir’s secrets.\nI bid farewell to my parents’ graves,\nunable to linger in my homeland.\nI parted from my middle-aged wife,\nleaving as the sky began to pale.\nI left my young children,\nturning away from the burning house.\nWhat others find hard to complete,\nthis traveler has already done.\nWhat others find hard to sever,\nthis traveler has already cut.\nTo witness the fruit of eternal life,\nI soared aloft on a crane’s back.\nCultivating after Heaven’s pattern, steadfast,\nmy two feet outpaced the toil.\nThe passing years urged my heart,\ntime fleeting as a galloping colt.\nI raised my gaze to Zhongnan Mountain,\nsighing thrice to the heavens.\nHeaven sent the Fire Dragon Master,\nwhose mysterious teachings matched one by one.\nKnowing my inner elixir was complete,\nhe did not speak of foundational work.\nHe bestowed upon me the outer elixir’s skill,\npiteously instructing me with earnest care.\nRefining the self, I forgot worldly attachments,\ngathering the medicine according to the seasons.\nThe prior Heaven has no weight,\nthe fire times no fixed measures.\nOnly distinguish old from young,\nmerely discern civil from martial.\nSeek purely with true intent,\nthe knife and scale defy clear description.\nFor ten months, embrace the primordial embryo;\nfor nine years, face the wall in meditation.\nExchange the cauldron to beget a new generation,\nmount the dragon to rise with thunder.\nThough Heaven and Earth may perish in time,\nthe immortal elder’s life knows no end!\n\n---\n\n**The Master’s Oral Transmission**\nThe sagely master’s oral transmission,\na famed formula bequeathed through ages.\nPassed to the people of the world,\nhow many can truly know it?\nA torn robe is mended with cloth,\na withered tree nurtured with soil.\nWhen a person is worn, what can restore them?\nThe mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.\nTake the elixir from within Kan,\na golden flower’s single dewdrop.\nAuspicious clouds open at Heaven’s edge,\npropitious light fills the grave’s foundation.\nReturn to the self, silent and dim,\nas if drunk, as if mad.\nThe great elixir, like a grain of millet,\ncasts off its husk to abide in non-action.\nRoaming freely through Heaven and Earth’s expanse,\nthe myriad images a pearl in the palm.\nIf one can ingest this medicine,\nlife spans the length of Heaven and Earth.\nIf it does not prolong life,\nmy words are all falsehood.\n\n---\n\n**Reply to Emperor Yongle**\nHeaven’s mechanism is not lightly revealed,\nlest the present age lack vigor.\nThrough a thousand trials and ten thousand hardships, toil and struggle.\nNow I transmit it to the pulse of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Emperor seeks from me the golden elixir,\nthe ancestral master left behind the formula for eternal life.\nWhat is the formula for eternal life?\nWhen Dao is full and virtue abundant, it is the true plan.\nCurb desires, settle the mind, calm the spirit’s cares—\nimmortals possess no other arts!\nBelow this, another five-character verse:\n*\"The golden elixir weighs one catty,\nclose your eyes and silently preserve the spirit.\nIt is found within the home,\nwhy labor to seek it outside?\nRefine the Li maiden’s mercury,\nconsume the Kan man’s essence.\nThe golden elixir and fire times—\neach word is the primordial sound.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Dao’s Sentiment**\nThe Dao’s sentiment is no ordinary feeling,\nonce you recognize Heaven’s mechanism, do not treat it lightly.\nFirst, set aside worldly attachments entirely,\nthen delve deeply into the principles.\nBefore refining the returning elixir, refine your nature;\nbefore cultivating the great medicine, cultivate your heart.\nWhen the heart is cultivated, the elixir’s trust arrives;\nwhen nature is purified, the medicinal materials grow.\nThe medicinal materials grow—apply effort diligently,\nthunder rumbles faintly, shaking the empty sky.\nWhere lightning flashes, seek the true seed;\nwhen the wind’s signal comes, find the root origin.\nRosy clouds in ten thousand strands envelop the golden cauldron,\npurple clouds a thousand fathoms shroud Heaven’s gate.\nIf you reach this point, do not be startled or afraid—\nsteadily guard the cavern’s gate with your primordial spirit.\nLike a cat seizing a mouse, a hare meeting a hawk,\nhurry and exert yourself, redoubling your effort.\nThe myriad forms and images are not of the same kind—\na single crimson light is the utmost truth.\nThis crimson light is the mind’s intent,\nwithin it, like dust in a bright window.\nSuspended is the prior Heaven’s medicine,\ndistant as a grape, near as gold.\nAt this point, rely entirely on caution—\nthe slightest thought arising loses the celestial truth.\nWait for that single point to submit of itself,\ntransforming within the body into the four seasons’ spring.\nA wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance,\neach rain’s passing brings renewal.\nAll day, languid as a drunkard,\nidly awaiting the cavern’s embrace.\nThe body’s yin essence is entirely stripped away,\ntransmuted into a lump of pure yang.\nAt this moment, breath ceases as in a minor death,\nforged into a single whole, the complete truth.\nHere, the work is accomplished and complete—\nthen return to the mortal world to accumulate merit.\nWhen merit is fulfilled and work complete, Heaven’s decree arrives,\nthe yang spirit emerges, revealing the true numen.\nThese words must not be spoken to the unworthy—\ndo not lightly discuss them with those who do not understand.\n\nWithin it lies the profoundest of mysteries—\nbeyond this truth, no truth remains.\nGather your provisions, seal them fast,\nso that one day your success may be stamped upon the heart.\n\nLet it be stamped upon the heart—\nseek the fifty-two verses well.\nShould false words be spoken, Heaven’s judgment falls;\nto speak of this to the unworthy invites the lash and loss of life!\n\n**Song of Refining Lead**\nWho understands the art of refining lead?\nAttain this, and you become a true immortal.\nI grieved in old age, finding no trace,\nwandering the Five Lakes and Three Isles.\nAt sixty-seven, I entered Zhongnan,\nwhere I met a true adept and received the supreme treasure.\nTrue lead arises before Heaven and Earth—\nwhat need is there for metals, stones, or herbs?\nRefine it through the nine nines, and when the work is done,\ngold treasures bloom within the crucible.\nA single golden bone shakes Heaven and Earth;\nthe harmony of two eights gives birth to a radiant form.\nOnce the radiant form emerges within the earthen cauldron,\nyou must guard it with unwavering mindfulness.\nWhen the first yang fire rises, nurture it gently;\nwhen the second yang fire rises, divine power manifests.\nShould it reach the third yang of the *Tai* hexagram,\na roaring blaze consumes the empty sky.\nThe yin tally retreats, giving rise to the numinous essence—\nonce the numinous essence is born, Heaven and Earth are complete.\nIf any deficiency remains, harmonize again,\nreturn it to the earthen cauldron to regenerate the numinous essence.\nWhen the full count of five thousand four hundred is reached,\nthe true marvel of refining lead is perfected.\nI charge you, later kindred spirits:\ndo not regard refining lead as an easy task.\n\n**Song of the Primordial Qi**\nBorn as a child of the primordial,\nhidden within the mountain of form, hard to encounter.\nI speak plainly—remember this well:\na single string of spring water encompasses the terrain.\nDraw it in through the lower gate, swallow it whole—\nthe twelve thunder gates tremble in awe.\nDrunk, oh drunk, ever more drunk,\nthe cinnabar field blooms with spring, red as jade.\nFeasting on peaches, savoring the fragrance of aged wine,\nthe *xun* wind stirs the primordial harmonious qi.\nYin demons are vanquished, spring fills the breast;\ngods wail, ghosts shriek, the heavens and earth overturn.\nWhen merit is complete and the work fulfilled to three thousand,\nmount the phoenix, ride the crane, and ascend as an immortal.\n\n**Song of Lead and Fire**\nThe great elixir arises at its appointed time—\nat the *hai* hour, the beginning of *zi*, the fifth watch of night.\nSpirit and essence unite in radiant splendor,\nvaguely, indistinctly, a bright moon is born.\nAfter union, it flows downward in a bubbling surge—\nthe first yang returns; do not let it slip away.\nHasten to seal the Great Mystery’s gate,\nfire drives the elixir past the *weilu* cavity.\nAt the moment of gathering, fix your gaze on the *niwan*;\nlower the left, then raise it, pausing to rest.\nThis is called \"gazing upward to ascend the mystery\";\nthen lower the right, raise it again, and bend.\nWhen the six sixes are complete, the elixir is born in *qian*;\nyang at its peak gives way to yin, shifting to the right.\nOpen the gate to withdraw the fire,\nyour gaze descends to guard the *kun* field.\nRight up, left down—once fixed,\nthe two eights complete a celestial cycle.\nThis is the natural rhythm of true firing—\nspontaneous ascent and descent, white draws and replenishes.\n\nThere are no crescents nor full moons, no bathings nor lengthy scriptures.\nStrange names swept away, metaphors cleared—\nonly these two lines hold the true essence.\n\n**Song of Realizing the Dao**\nThe spirit does not wander outward, essence does not leak.\nQi is not dissipated; the numinous sprout takes root.\nThe Five Phases and Four Images enter the Central Palace—\nwhy fear the golden elixir will not form itself?\nWithin dwells the true spirit, without appear responses;\nall around, empty blossoms descend like white snow.\nAt the return of the first yang, *hai* and *zi* converge,\nand within appears the full round moon.\nHasten to apply effort—\ngold, once at its fullest, cannot be plucked.\nBreath stirs the fire of the Mysterious Pass,\ncleaving the azure sky and rending the primordial mist.\nThe Yellow River flows backward to Kunlun’s heights,\nthe nine orifices and three barriers all open wide.\nTransformed into nectar, it is swallowed into the belly—\na mute tasting honey, beyond words to tell.\nAt this stage of practice, be most vigilant:\ngather and bathe in accord with the seasons.\nThe two grades of yin and yang share the same nature,\nyet the firing times differ within and without.\nThe numinous medicine is obtained in a fleeting moment,\nbut its nurturing still requires ten months.\nTo mature further, pass through three years—\nthree threes like nine, and the elixir avoids all harm.\nWhen the elixir is complete, let out a long whistle and depart the mountain,\nleaving traces of concealment and manifestation in your wake.\nThe Celestial Emperor, hearing your name, sends down a purple writ,\nsummoning you to ascend the heavens in azure flight.\nIf later generations diligently cultivate by this,\nthey shall be guests at the assembly of the Three Pure Ones.\n\n**Song of Sitting in Meditation**\nAt first, when sitting, learn to contemplate Chan—\nthis subtle message lies in the Mysterious Pass.\nSecretly, subtly, regulate the breath,\nyin and yang simmering between the brows.\nNature must be awakened, life transmitted—\ndo not treat the firing times as trivial.\nWith eyes closed, observe the heart and guard the original destiny;\npurity and non-action are the root.\nWithin a hundred days, signs appear—\nthe point within *kan* flips upward.\nThe Yellow Dame acts as matchmaker,\nthe infant and the maiden unite in harmony.\nThe beauty is endless—\nto whom can it be told?\nThe whole body surges with qi, piercing the heavens.\nWho knows this subtle message?\nA mute dreaming, unable to speak.\nAct swiftly—\ngather the primordial,\nthe numinous medicine’s single point piercing the three barriers.\nFrom the cinnabar field it ascends straight to the *niwan* peak,\nthen descends past the heavy tower to the Great Central Origin.\nWater and fire in harmony, true lead and mercury—\nwithout *wu* and *ji*, the elixir cannot form.\nDeath must be embraced, life must be firm,\nthe radiance of spirit illuminating the three thousand worlds.\nBeneath the shadowless tree, the golden rooster crows;\nin the dead of night, the red lotus appears.\nAt winter solstice, the first yang begins its return—\na thunderclap shakes the heavens.\nThe dragon calls, the tiger rejoices,\ncelestial music resounds, no ordinary sound.\nVaguely, indistinctly, preserve being and non-being—\nboundless transformations lie within.\nMystery within wonder, wonder within mystery,\nthe river chariot transports past the three barriers.\nHeaven and earth in harmony, the ten thousand things are born;\ndaily drinking sweet dew, sweet as honey.\nImmortal is Buddha,\nBuddha is immortal—\na single nature, perfectly luminous, not two.\nThe Three Teachings were originally one family:\nhungry, eat; tired, sleep.\nFalsely burning incense, bowing in Chan—\nhow could they know the Great Dao lies before their eyes?\nDeluded, they fast and miss the chance—\nonce the human body is lost, myriad kalpas pass in vain.\nFoolishly chasing the Western Paradise,\na blind man stumbling into the deep mountains at night.\nThe primal mechanism is wondrous, not trivial—\nto leak the celestial secret is a crime as heavy as mountains.\n\n**Four Upright Principles**\nWith intent, contemplate:\nbreak through the Mysterious Pass, wondrously penetrating the mystery.\n*Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—unceasing through the night,\nearly seek a bright teacher to congeal the elixir.\nOne who recognizes true lead and mercury\nis an immortal of ageless life.\nCultivate day by day, firm each day—\ndo not view the practice with short-sighted eyes.\nAfter two years and nine, the work is accomplished,\na single grain of purple golden elixir refined.\nWould you know who composed this song?\nThe Pure Emptiness Daoist, the Immortal Zhang Sanfeng.\n\n**Song of the Dao’s Essential Secrets**\nThe Dao’s essential song, the Dao’s essential song—\nnot knowing the essentials, one is surely beset by demons.\nObserve the Mysterious Pass, regulate the true breath—\nknowing these two essentials, cultivation is complete.\nWith the original spirit, enter the sea of qi;\nwhen spirit and qi merge in silence, one attains the true sovereign of the first mystery.\nWith the original qi, enter the Yellow Court;\nwhen qi and spirit harmonize in obscurity, one attains the most luminous second mystery.\nOne mystery is wondrous, one mystery is the aperture—\nwith desire, observe the aperture; without desire, observe the wonder.\nThese two mysteries are the true mechanism—\nwho knows they emerge from the same source under different names?\nTo observe the Mysterious Pass, there is no other secret:\nfirst, from within the aperture, regulate the true breath.\nSpirit serene, qi still—utterly natural—\nthe wonder spontaneously arises, the Supreme Ultimate appears.\nThe ancient immortals spoke mostly in half-words,\nfearing to leak the true mechanism, they did not speak recklessly.\nSome said it is fixed in the center,\nothers said it is formless and must be grasped intuitively.\nNow, in this age, I speak fully—\nit lies between the fixed and the formless.\nFixed is called the aperture, formless the wonder—\nwhat Laozi called \"mystery upon mystery.\"\nPointing clearly, I ferry the sentient—\nleaving this for my disciples as a reward.\nMeet it and not cultivate—become a lesser ghost;\nto be sage or mortal rests with the person.\n\nAt the outset, practice is most difficult—\nleaving distraction, only to sink into torpor.\nThe great superior person possesses true learning,\nnecessarily distinguishing spirit and qi into pure and turbid.\nThe primordial spirit is now most clear,\nthe postnatal spirit is but turbid matter.\nSweep away the turbid, guard the clear,\nseal the Three Treasures within the numinous valley.\nThis numinous valley—\nis the aperture.\nWithin the aperture, regulate the breath with deep reflection.\nOne breath goes, one breath comes,\neach breath interdependent, each moment close.\nSubtly, silently, unnoticed by others,\nspirit and qi gather, surging through the nine orifices.\nPractice thus to attain the aperture’s wonder—\nwhence could torpor and distraction arise?\n\n**Song of the Great Dao**\nNow, lend your ears to my words:\nthe Dao has the primordial and the postnatal.\nThe postnatal dregs are of no use—\nthe primordial’s single point is called true lead.\nTo be ignorant of true lead,\nto lose one’s original nature—\nthis is the first illness of cultivation.\nFew walk the path to the Jade Clarity Palace—\nI now point out the immortal’s realm.\nLife must be transmitted, nature must be awakened—\nto ascend as sage or transcend as immortal rests with you.\n\n**Quiet Practice Awakens Nature, Movement Gathers the Elixir**\nWithin, the tortoise and serpent coil in inversion.\nAt the stirring of the single yang, begin the work—\nturning the Celestial Gate demands fierce vigor.\nYin arises at noon within the yang of Kan,\nwhile at Mao and You, proceed with measured calm.\nThe Dipper’s handle turns the wheel toward the Purple Palace,\nlaughing to welcome the young guest, Master Huang.\n\nIn the Palace of the Yellow Dame, meet the Maiden of Mystery—\nthe Maiden and the Infant pair of their own accord.\nTo lay the foundation, refine the self;\nrefine it to purity, then gather with clarity.\nMy obscure master taught me this segment of practice:\nfirst open the nine orifices by unsealing the gates.\nThe nine orifices originate at the Weilu point—\nbegin at the soles’ bubbling springs, surging upward.\nFrom the bubbling springs, rise gradually to the knees;\nbelow the knees, the work demands exertion.\nThe Buddhists call this \"reed sprouts,\"\nor liken it to insects creeping, thorns piercing.\nPass the knees slowly to reach the Weilu,\nwhere a hard object seems to resist.\nOnly then proceed with all higher practices—\nthree stages of work, each with its oral formula.\nOnce the three passes converge in one opening,\nturn it upward to the Mud Pill Palace.\nPierce the Golden Lock Gate, descend the Magpie Bridge—\nthe Twelve-Storied Tower, how wondrous indeed!\nThe Twelve-Storied Tower is the Crimson Palace,\nand within the Crimson Palace lies the Yellow Court.\nThe Yellow Court’s chamber must be refined;\nits essence is the single luminous point at its center.\nNever mistake obscurity for secrecy—\nthe Yellow Court is the true Mysterious Pass.\nIf you fail to recognize the Mysterious Pass in its true place,\nwhere can true lead arrive and settle?\n\nHave you not seen the *Awakening to Reality* poem?\n\"Only by the Mysterious Female can the root be established.\"\nWhen true essence returns, the golden void remains—\na single luminous pearl never departs.\nHave you not read the *Triple Concordance*?\n\"It resembles Penglai, no falsehood in the comparison.\"\nClosing below is called the supreme closure of the existent;\nthe two apertures’ method requires qi’s mutual dependence.\nFrom now on, when discoursing on the Dao or expounding on the profound,\nall else is vain without this.\n\nOnce the gates are opened and merit is accumulated,\nforging the sword demands understanding the true message.\nEven Moye was wrought from iron—\nhow much more is my sword inherently straight!\nHeaven is the furnace, earth the forge;\ngold and water must balance—never act recklessly.\nAt Zi and Wu, practice to temper it,\nable to be hard or soft, to take or discard.\nWhen the sword is complete, gather true lead—\ngather the primordial chaos before it divides.\nIf you receive only postnatal qi,\nyou merely extend his lifespan.\n\nAt the second watch of the seventh day, the true mechanism appears—\nseek it within the divine land of the Red Continent.\nIf you obtain both method and resource,\nthen carefully ponder and distinguish.\nPink clouds, the hue of a pheasant’s plumage,\nlips like cinnabar, skin as snow.\nWise and intelligent, nature gentle and kind,\neyes like lacquered pearls, hair pure black.\nQi clear, gaze steady, steps measured—\nonly then calculate the months and years within.\nFive thousand four hundred births yield the Yellow Path,\ndim and distant, born of vagueness.\nGather in accord with the time, determining rise and fall—\nnot a hair’s breadth may be transgressed.\nAt this juncture, know the crescent moon’s third day;\nthe wonder lies in the west’s Geng and Xin, white.\nThe sword of wisdom sharp, the inner heart sincere,\nstrike the bamboo to resonate, then pluck the zither.\nThe Heavenly Ladder must be used—never omitted!\nWho can fathom such profound and secret mechanisms?\nDo not recklessly fish the giant turtle from the sea’s depths,\nlest you startle it away, never to return.\n\nGuard the furnace without damage, distinguish the timing with care—\ngathering postnatal qi only extends the years.\nOne double-hour divides into six watches;\nthe elixir forms in just two watches.\nThe remaining four watches hold divine work—\nthe wonder lies in heart-transmission, hard to divulge.\n\nWhen true lead arrives, ignite the spiritual fire—\nfrom west to east, first seek me.\nMove my true mercury, a single red point,\nto meet and merge into one pearl.\nPass the three passes, ascend to the Mud Pill Palace,\ndescend the Twelve-Storied Tower, vast and cold.\nNeither foolish nor wise,\nneither sober nor drunk.\nIf not for expending spirit throughout the body,\nhow could husband and wife unite as a pair?\n\nOnce the elixir is settled, the heart toils at dusk and dawn—\nthe *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams respond at dawn and dusk.\nKnow that bathing occurs within them—\nat Mao and You, do not advance.\nGuard the city walls, cease the martial work,\nand the crucible fills with numinous cinnabar, crimson.\nAfter ten months, the work is complete—\nthe vessel, the elixir chamber, all emptied.\nEnter the deep mountains, embrace the One,\nall things voided, effortless.\nCold, heat, hunger, and toil cannot assail you;\nfor nine majestic years, face the wall.\nFrom the Northern Sea at dawn to Yingzhou at dusk,\nsuddenly, when merit and practice are complete,\nthe Three Officials of the Water Palace tally your years—\na sealed elixir missive descends from the Jade Heaven,\ngreen luan and white cranes dance, their wings flapping.\nOnly when enlightenment is thorough and investiture complete\nwill you forever become an ageless immortal.\n\n**Song of the True Bellows**\nDo not say the Great Dao acts through non-action—\nwhy then fiddle with the bellows in the chamber?\nWhen desire stirs, not a moment’s rest,\npurple qi and red light flicker wildly.\nThe Azure Dragon rejoices, the White Tiger despises—\nthe Azure Dragon coils around the tortoise’s shell.\nTwo streams of true qi pierce the Celestial Palace,\ndecisively ascending to the Three Clarities’ Pavilion.\nWithin the pavilion, a jade pool is clearly seen,\nholding the medicine of ageless life.\nGather it in due time and consume it—\nthen enjoy the bliss of Penglai.\n\n**Song of the Mysterious Pass**\nThe Mysterious Pass, a single aperture, holds the true formula—\nheaven and earth split open, Penglai’s vastness revealed.\nIn the Yellow Court dwells an original elder,\nholding the zither, awaiting the moon at the sky’s edge.\nThe second water is clear, the third water turbid—\nwhen the golden flower blooms, the Dui trigram’s head is incomplete.\nOn Mount Emei, purple mist flies,\nthe mist transforms, melting the red furnace’s snow.\nThe dragon’s chant compels, the tiger’s roar presses—\nthe numinous tortoise drinks the Golden Crow’s blood.\nRiding the dragon, sword at the waist, drunk and returning home,\nturn the three passes to face the Northern Palace.\n\n**Oral Formula for Refining Lead**\nThe Supreme Dao, proclaimed again and again,\nreveals the distinction between the primordial and the postnatal.\nIt speaks only of lead born after Gui,\nnot of yang arising before Gui.\nRein in the horse of the mind, lock the monkey of the heart;\nwithout stray thoughts, the intent must be single.\nSever greed and anger, extinguishing the three poisons;\neradicate love and desire, driving away the five thieves.\nThe Flowery Pond’s water, the Upper Valley’s spring—\nthe ancients used these to moisten the three fields.\n\nIf you would know the medicine for returning to the root and extending years,\nyou must refine the returning elixir, the life-continuing lead.\nForth from the Northern Sea, through the Western River,\nunder the craftsman’s hand, plant the golden lotus.\nCapture alive the tiger’s marrow to refine in the furnace,\nseize the turtle’s essence to simmer in the cauldron.\nThe primordial qi, the mist of Great Simplicity—\na single draught of ghee preserves the countenance.\nOnce attained, let cold and heat transform as they will;\ningest it, and leap beyond the gate of life and death.\n\nSeek the crescent in the scriptures, trace the new moon’s arc—\nI now reveal the wondrous Central Origin.\nWhen water and fire achieve balance in one cycle,\nyin and yang unite in three thousand reckonings.\nAt the farther shore, no boat is needed;\nextinguish thoughts, dissolve passions, sever false ties.\nIn stillness and clarity, behold the treasure of life;\nin dimness and silence, guard the embryonic immortal.\nEndure hardship for two or three years,\nand the yang spirit emerges, sacred work complete.\nTend the fire without fear, mastering creation—\neternal life, ageless as heaven.\n\n**Song of the Golden Elixir**\nOne grain of golden elixir weighs a pound;\nwhoever knows it attains eternal life.\nLay the foundation, sweeping away worldly affairs;\nrefine the self, only to nurture the primordial spirit.\nThe Yellow Court’s earthen crucible, the primordial mercury—\nall cares dissolve, worldly passions cease.\nDeparting the self is not the Dao;\nclinging to the self is also void.\n\nI now disclose the celestial mechanism’s principle,\nspeaking to all heroic seekers of the Dao.\nBefore your eyes lies the path to eternal life,\nyet ten thousand mortals stray from the original source.\nSweep the spirit-terrace clean of every thought,\nbody at ease, in stillness enact the mysterious work.\nBreath in emptiness, spirit guarding the chamber,\na hundred meridians return to the source like limpid water.\nWithin the body, true lead manifests—\na single crimson radiance, bright as the moon.\nThe Mysterious Pass comes and goes without fixed place;\nyin and yang ascend and descend by the hour.\nWithin the year, take the month; within the month, take the day;\nat mid-autumn, the moon’s orb appears.\nFor thirty days, remain seated at home,\nnever apart from the Purple Tenuity star.\nFacing south, observe the Northern Dipper’s handle—\njust as the sun reaches noon, the second watch strikes.\nIn the northwest, set the furnace to refine the numinous medicine;\nin the east, erect the cauldron to enact the divine work.\nCauldron and furnace face each other, true hands at work;\nthe sword of wisdom hangs in the Crystal Palace.\nThe Yellow Dame beckons as matchmaker,\nthe numinous turtle and fire furnace in the deep of night.\nGhee poured upon the crown, the true bellows—\ngather the primordial qi in its authenticity.\nEach breath a twist at the Celestial Valley’s point,\nthe river chariot transports it up Mount Kunlun.\nCrossing the Magpie Bridge, it enters the Flowery Pond,\ndescending the twelve-story tower of the Lofty Mansion.\nPassing the Tail Gate, the spine’s three passes—\nthe Metal Lord returns to the great Yellow Court.\nLead comes to seek mercury, cat pouncing on mouse;\nmercury goes to seek lead, hare spying hawk.\nNine revolutions of the divine elixir in the great golden crucible,\nten months of gestation, creation perfected.\nUnaware of cold or heat, true creation—\nthe body transformed to pure yang, true gold.\nAccumulate three thousand deeds in the dust,\nand ascend at daylight to the Jade Capital.\n\n**Song of the Returning Elixir, Breaking Delusion**\nThe returning elixir’s formula, the returning elixir’s formula—\nI now explain it to you in careful detail.\nThe Gate of Toil’s minor path spans three thousand leagues;\nall else but this golden elixir is a byway.\nTen thousand dross qualities are no trifle—\ntrue yin and true yang are the proper graft.\nYin and yang unite,\nlead and mercury join;\ninfant and maiden blaze in the void.\nDragon and tiger ascend and descend, revolving;\nthe numinous turtle at the sea’s bottom plays with stars and moon.\nThe long yellow sprout, flying white snow—\nthe water’s golden dew is the primordial formula.\nThe true Yellow Dame, the true bellows—\nthe golden elixir is the medicine of eternal life.\nFirst lay the foundation, then advance the medicine;\na hundred days’ work must be firmly held.\nIf you guide the two qi back to the Yellow Path,\nthe three families meet, the immortal embryo forms.\nRefine the nature, join the life;\ndo not waste months and years among men.\nIf you return lead and mercury to true earth,\nadd mercury, refine lead, and they never perish.\nThe crow, eight ounces; the hare, half a pound—\nboth enter the village of Wu and Ji.\nMartial at both ends, civil in the center,\nthe four images captured and simmered together.\nTen months of diligent work, the fire’s timing complete—\npure yang refined, life without end.\nTransfer the cauldron, shift the embryo for three to five years;\nnine years facing the wall, the yang spirit emerges.\nMysterious is the ancestor, the female the origin—\nthe primordial, the earth, the root of all things.\nPierce the eye that sees through earth and heaven,\nturn the Celestial Pass, the Dipper’s handle in reverse.\nOpen the aperture, qi flows of itself;\nthe thunder turns the Dipper’s handle with a mighty roar.\nAt the sea’s bottom, clouds draw water, dragons churn waves;\nat the Mud Pill, wind rises, tigers roar.\nIf you master the method of inverting yin and yang,\ncreation of heaven and earth is accomplished in an instant.\n\nExpound the *Awakening to Reality*, discourse on the *Unity of the Three*—\nthis principle was originally one.\nThough this medicine is obtained from the chamber,\nthe great medicine of the golden elixir is not the same.\nEven if you refine essence with surpassing skill,\nseal the Tail Gate, and long for ascension—\nwithout the golden elixir, all is in vain.\nBirds and beasts know how to preserve their forms:\nthe turtle draws breath through its nose to regulate qi,\nthe deer circulates qi at the Tail Gate to refine essence.\nThe crane’s embryo is ever steadfastly held,\nby night it companions clouds and pines in tranquil nurture.\nBeasts may attain a thousand years of life,\nyet men fail to awaken to eternal life.\nThroughout the world, men covet profit and fame,\nheedless of the King of Hell’s ledger.\nMen are born and die, beasts perish—\nwhen the three powers’ qi severs, ghosts become neighbors.\n\nThe primordial medicine, the postnatal medicine—\nthese are the true wondrous things of yin and yang.\nThe primordial medicine can transcend,\nthe postnatal medicine extends the life-shell.\nIf men grasp the mechanism of grafting,\nthey attain eternal life and great enlightenment.\nRefine the nature, complete the life—\nattain the primordial seed to plant in the Mud Pill.\nThe youth who cultivates, with essence and qi complete,\nin stillness, a single spark can ascend to heaven.\nOnly the formless body remains unbroken—\nthis is the Great Luo Immortal of true cultivation.\nIn youth, one loses primordial yang;\nmidway through life, leaving home, the nature runs wild.\nThe yang line enters the yin line’s reflection,\nbecoming the Li trigram, inwardly hollow.\nTake the solid center of the Kan position,\nreturn to the root, revert to yang.\nTrue water and fire pair yin and yang—\nmen must not indulge in reckless thoughts.\nThough you sit in emptiness, practicing non-action,\nyou cannot escape death, buried on Mount Beimang.\n\nCultivate stillness, guard the Central Yellow—\nto old age, all differences are vain effort.\nEven if you comprehend the true suchness of nature,\nthe yin soul reincarnates, entering the realm of ghosts.\n\nThe elixir of life, the nectar of returning soul—\nthe Golden Elixir is the true medicine within.\nSwallow but a single grain into the belly,\nand you reverse aging, restore youth, prolong life.\n\nForsake your wife, renounce grain,\nhold fast to the fast, expound the Dharma, journey to the West.\nNo matter how many heterodox methods you master,\nall apart from this path are but madness.\n\nI have revealed all the celestial mechanisms—\nthe Returned Elixir is indeed the immortal’s formula.\nGenerations of immortals attain this,\ntranscending the mortal world to ascend to heaven.\n\nI exhort later Dao seekers:\nheed not the false teachers’ deceptive words.\nIf you obtain the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir,\nyou will extend years, abide in the world, live boundlessly.\n\nBy this cultivation, you tread the path of eternal life,\nrepaying your master’s grace, giving thanks to heaven.\nHold fast to this secret,\nmake it your compassionate vessel.\nWhen merit is complete and work perfected,\nyou move the Jade Emperor’s heart.\n\nWho crafted the Golden Liquid that breaks delusion?\nFrom ancient times, it has flowed forth from Yuanhua Zhang.\n\n---\n\n**Two Songs of the Dragon-Tiger Returned Elixir, Pointing the Path to Delusion**\n\nThough you inquire everywhere for the immortal’s ladder,\nonly at the first stirring of yang does it become wondrous.\nWater submerges Kunlun, overturning the azure sea;\nthe tiger’s roar on the cliff is the ancestral foundation.\n\nThis directly points to the carefree shortcut—\na bright moon illuminates Mount Sumeru.\nThe tiger in water, the dragon in fire,\nwithin the Eight Trigrams and Five Phases, they manifest radiance.\n\nSeize the dragon—purple mist arises;\nsubdue the tiger—golden floral dew appears.\nHow do these two images establish the root of the Dao?\nOnly because they have long borrowed the path of Caoxi.\n\nMale pairs with female, yin pairs with yang,\ntheir union clearly a battle.\nWu-ji soil forms the Yellow Chamber—\nwhen spirit and qi are pure, it is the King of Medicines.\n\nRefine the grain of Purple Gold Elixir,\nand you ride the crane, mount the phoenix, to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.\nThe tiger hides in the azure sea, slumbering with the child;\nthe dragon circles the Fusang tree in the sun’s light.\n\nWait until the yang of spring stirs,\nthe tiger emits golden light, the dragon spits saliva.\nWith a treasured sword at your waist, gather the dragon’s mist;\nwhen the tiger sees the dragon return, they submerge together.\n\nThe two creatures follow one another to Wu-ji,\nin a crucible of true fire, slowly simmered.\nFrom midnight to the year’s end, the firing times are strict;\nat dawn and dusk, do not neglect the work.\n\nSwallow the ancestral qi, consume the jade nectar—\nwho understands true emptiness within form?\nRefinement lies solely in the place of one’s birth;\nthe Ten Kings of Hell share this method.\n\nHasten to awaken, do not be foolishly greedy—\ndo not call the old man’s words heresy.\nThough you expound the Three Treasuries’ Dharma,\nwithout awakening to non-arising, it is all in vain.\n\nBreak open this iron steamed bun,\nand you will roam carefree for billions of years.\n\n---\n\n**Three-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of the Soul’s Birth, Three Returns to One**\n\nMonth by month,\nall are the true essence and blood within the young lotus.\nNo need to set up the furnace or establish the crucible—\nonly use non-action to draw it through.\n\nNor wait for the qi of the two crescents;\nwait only for the star palace between the brows.\nNor wait for eight taels or half a catty as the living child;\nwait only for the exact moment of five thousand four hundred.\n\nNo need for spirit to commune across bodily separation—\nonly use the two ○ of upper exhalation and lower inhalation.\nFirst, the whole body warms;\nsecond, the fontanel opens;\nthird, the celestial eye opens—\nthen you see the great thousandfold world.\nAt this point of efficacy, it is truly\nthe birth of the embryo, the birth of the fetus, the birth of the soul.\n\nInstruct the immortal-seeking disciples:\nyou must ride the crane amidst the clouds,\nnever be buried in the sands and dust.\n\n---\n\n**Four-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of the Po’s Birth, Four Returns to Two**\n\nThe Venerable Ancestor is named the Demon-Quelling Protector of the Dao,\npermeating the seven po, mastering them at you.\nWithin you lies true gold—\ngold can preserve eternal life.\nThe imperial true po, the life’s origin,\nfrom this, the wondrous primordial arises.\n\nOn the wedding night in the bridal chamber,\nfacing circumstances, forget passion.\n*Tali kou ye, kou mo li ye,\njin zha mu zha kou ta nan kou ye, kou yan,\nsi wo ye, si wo ye,\nnamo prajñā-pāramitā ye.*\n\n---\n\n**Seven-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of Opening the Heart and Seven Orifices, Seven Returns to Five**\n\nThe Dao Lord sits in the Grand Tenuity,\ndescending as the Great Heavenly Honored One.\nHe bestows these true Dharma words,\nguiding people to the Jade Purity.\n\nA single-character secret,\nseven months as its form.\nTwo on the left, three on the right, called five—\nthe Supreme Ultimate is naturally endowed with five numina.\n\nOnly when the five numina attain it do the seven orifices open;\nyou must move the celestial eye to come here.\nThose who truly cultivate the Dao\npierce the mechanism to ascend the jeweled terrace.\n\n---\n\n**Ten-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of Firmness of Form and Spirit, Ten Returns**\n\nThe Immortal Maiden of Jade Flute plays her jade flute,\neach note blowing into the primordial pass—\nthis pass is called the root of heaven and earth.\nWhen the primordial is sufficient, a hundred scenes naturally give birth to spirit;\nthe eight scenes give birth to the twenty-four heavens,\nand the nine orifices naturally open to the numinous.\n\nThe sacred embryo originally borrows a single true spark;\nthe Queen Mother’s Jasper Pool brims with golden liquid,\nthe lotus heart.\nHeart after heart unites with the yellow sprout,\nfragrance arises within, brocading heaven and earth.\n\nSeizing the true fragrance’s wondrous mist,\nit preserves me for kalpas, ever abiding.\nEver since the Pure Yang Patriarch revealed this,\ngenerations of the worthy have applied their minds.\n\nOn Penglai Isle, your name shall remain;\nat the Yingzhou Assembly, you shall meet.\nYou must emulate Master Xu,\nwho in broad daylight raised his dwelling and ascended.\n\nThree years of earnest exhortation today—\nmay all people possess longevity,\nyang uniting with the primordial root.\n\n---\n\n**Song of Securing the Leak**\n\nSpeak of the mysterious, expound the mysterious—\nmove the spirit, turn the nine orifices,\nknock down the three passes and eight gates.\nClose the Grotto Chamber, refine the elixir furnace—\ndo not let the six thieves cause clamor.\n\nThe master laughs heartily,\nguarding the Yellow Court.\nAh!\nThe infant comes, the crone and maiden—\nthe two families unite in wondrous mystery.\n\nBind the Golden Elixir, hold it in your embrace—\nthe whole body,\na radiant glow shines.\nSit in the Cinnabar Field, called the Pure Void—\npurple qi and red light ever gleam,\nrising to Mount Sumeru and the Mud Pill,\ndescending to the Bubbling Spring, penetrating the profound.\n\n**Stealing Treasures from the Seven-Jewel Pool**\n\nSteal the treasures from the Seven-Jewel Pool—\ncast aside all impure essence and turbid qi.\nJade branches and golden blossoms ever new,\ncoral and agate, chariots wrought by the Wheel-King.\n\nSecure the leaking body, seal the leaking orifices,\nno leak in the cauldron, no leak in ascent.\nThe Twelve-Storied Tower stands open,\nthe seven meridians and eight vessels merge with the Triple Burner,\nall bones and limbs bear witness.\n\nThe large intestine encircles, the small intestine glows,\nabove and below, the Magpie Bridge flows smooth.\nCross the Zhaozhou Bridge to drink tea,\nby the Sweet River, heed the great cry.\n\nThe great cycle flows, the small cycle arrives—\nthe Three Families meet in joy.\nI fortify this leaking body,\nfor ten thousand years, no old or young.\n\n**In Praise:**\nSecure the leaking form, refine the Great Yang,\nessence, vitality, and spirit whole—guard the Central Yellow.\nLead and mercury simmered into supreme treasure,\na single grain of Golden Elixir radiates brilliance.\nThe Infant manifests, ever abiding,\nattaining longevity to escape impermanence.\nWhoever masters the *Song of Securing the Leak*\nholds the formula for ageless life.\n\n---\n\n**Later Song of Realization**\n\nA worm in the world, lost in the world,\ndrifting all day, no rest, no peace.\nThe true apertures—none understand;\nfind them, and the true gate appears.\n\nNo stinginess, no attachment,\nno one to scorn, no one to blame.\nNo meditation, no prostrations,\nno sitting in lotus, no lazy precepts.\n\nRoam the ends of the earth, see the world,\nmeet wine—drink a few cups,\nmeet meat—eat a few bites.\nBeg a bowl of rice, stuff the skin-bag,\nfind a scrap of cloth, cover the Four Great.\nA broken house? Build it yourself.\nThe master within—seek peace.\n\nNo stepping into fame or profit,\nno clinging to success or failure,\nno debt to the state,\nno burden of children’s debts.\nIf others seek me, I remain untroubled.\n\nMorning wander by the five lakes,\nevening rest in the green mountains.\nA boulder for a pillow,\nthe blue sky as a blanket.\nTigers and leopards dare not intrude,\ndemons and monsters dare not harm.\nUnaware, I sleep till the sun glows red,\nno fear, no terror, no dread.\n\nFrom now on, shatter the Gate of Illusion,\nleap free beyond the red dust.\nClap hands, laugh heartily—\ntrue freedom in true freedom.\n\n---\n\n**Palindrome Poem**\n\nBy the bridge, the courtyard faces the willow-lined bay,\nmoonlit night, half the door ajar.\nFrom afar, the crane returns to the grotto late,\nquietly strumming the lute, sitting with idle clouds.\n\nSeeking fire for the elixir, no empty furnace,\ngathering herbs for immortality, fine mountains abound.\nThe gourd hangs high—long has the hermit hidden,\nfar from the clamor, the stream’s murmur flows.\n\n---\n\n**Thirty-Six Poems on the Golden Elixir**\n\n**Cultivating the Dao, Returning to Truth**\n\nA wanderer on rivers and lakes for decades,\nI met my master and bit through the iron steamed bun.\nWho seasons the sweetest honey?\nA midnight lamp with oil to spare!\n\nTrust the Dao—form and spirit enter wonder,\nonly then know life and nature must be fully refined.\nSince grasping this small truth,\nI’ve forgotten the world’s ten thousand bushels of sorrow.\n\n**Leaving the Dust, Old Recluse**\n\nA heart at leisure, free of worldly dust,\nin thunder’s stillness, nurturing spirit.\nA plain lute plucks the moon from the sky,\ndark wine drains the spring from the jar’s depths.\n\nVital qi ascends with the sun,\nthe Three Flowers gather at the crown, ever renewed.\nRefining the Great Medicine to transcend the mortal,\nI carefully inscribe these verses to warn later seekers.\n\n**Sweeping the Mind, Cultivating the Heart**\n\nInside and out, a tangle of scenes like hemp—\nwhere can one boast of deeds?\nLet go—this is the true shortcut;\nturn back, return to the light—this is home.\n\nSix roots purified, without obstruction,\nFive Aggregates emptied, flawless.\nUtterly forgotten, the heart’s square inch still—\na bright moon illuminates *Nanhua*.\n\n**Resisting the Sleep Demon**\n\nDrowsy stupor harms more than lightly—\nas soon as dusk falls, fatigue arises.\nAlways attend to matters with vigilance,\nkeep the heart fiercely awake.\n\nThough the body may seem drunk,\nrouse the spirit, sit till dawn.\nWith this whip, strike hard—awaken!\nWhat endeavor cannot be achieved?\n\n**Seeking the Mysterious Pass (I)**\n\nA single aperture, the Mysterious Pass—gateway to the Way,\nneither heart nor kidney, most profound and hidden.\nSearching the bladder or perineum is vain labor,\nsifting the spleen, stomach, or Mud Pill is futile.\n\nThe root of spirit and qi ever elusive,\ndelve deep into the cavern of emptiness.\nIt is but the place of numinous clarity—\nnurture the Returned Elixir, ride the crane in flight.\n\n**Seeking the Mysterious Pass (II)**\n\nPuppets on stage nod in time,\nknow all is pulled by unseen strings.\nThough pulled by another’s hand,\nwho commands my strings?\n\nRely on the Master’s constant moonlight,\nensure every place is graced with fine breeze.\nTo seek the elixir at Winter Solstice,\nlook within the quiet of the numinous terrace.\n\n**On the Mysterious Pass**\n\nThe body is Qian and Kun—seek not without,\nthe numinous aperture, most profound and hidden.\nTwo or three may be companions,\none or four may join the fellowship.\n\nFive Earths build the center, governing growth,\nwhere the Xun wind rises, hardness and softness are fixed.\nSince grasping the wonder of returning to the origin,\nin the Six-Six Palace, spring and autumn recur.\n\n**Forging the Spirit Sword**\n\nThe master transmits the method of forging the Green Snake,\ntempered in the Kun crucible and Qian furnace.\nNeither iron nor gold, yet brimming with life and death,\nformless and shadowless, it moves with spirit.\n\nDrawn from the scabbard, heaven and earth shrink,\nsheathed in the breast, it fits within a mustard seed.\nWorth ten thousand taels of gold, yet unfindable—\nhidden in the body, it slays demons and spirits.\n\n**Postnatal Foundation-Building**\n\nQi decayed, blood depleted—time to mend;\nthe enlightened master imparts the oral secret.\nJade fluid from the Flower Pool, swallow with the hours,\npeach-blossom nectar, sip with the days.\n\nAbandon thought, forget worry—return to the child’s heart,\nroot and life restored—immortal’s work.\nThe Cinnabar Field warms, the face regains youth,\nmocking those who cling to empty heads of snow.\n\n**Postnatal Refinement of the Self**\n\nWho knows the work of refining the self?\nThe numinous ever attends me.\nNot a speck of dust stains the heart—all is still,\nten thousand cares forgotten—nature like a fool’s.\n\nNo demon dares invade the inner realm,\nthe disciple all day serves the stern master.\nHungry, I drink the wine of immortality,\ndaily drunk as mud, yet never sated.\n\n**Refining the Self to Obtain the Medicine**\n\nRefining the self follows foundation-building,\nten thousand cares at heart already forgotten.\nA single moon’s glow keeps me company,\nthe thunder’s roar at midnight—only I know.\n\nSnowflakes in stillness fly as white specks,\nsprouts from emptiness grow as golden branches.\nSeizing the yang qi, it returns to conceive—\ngiving birth to a thousand-year child who rides the crane.\n\n**Commencing the Refinement of the Self**\n\nBody apart, spirit communes—principle most clear.\nThe two hands must correspond in their work.\nSet the furnace, erect the crucible, seek the true seed,\nface the world without passion, recognize the native land.\n\nSeize the dragon’s head to gather the purple mist,\nsplit the tiger’s tail to reveal the golden light.\nA speck of true lead swallowed into the belly—\nall things shine, life endures long.\n\n**The Primal Crucible**\n\nOnce the primal aperture is discerned,\nthe crucible of heaven and earth is known.\nNo need for spiritual effort to regulate water and fire—\nnaturally, the numinous qi permeates skin and flesh.\n\nMorning by morning, the yellow crane hides in the golden crucible,\nnight by night, the silver toad pours into the jade pot.\nTo grasp the truth of the golden elixir,\npractice where the body has not yet been born.\n\n**The Primal True Lead**\n\nAll the world loves to enter the mystery,\nyet none recognize this primal lead.\nWithin five thousand days, the yellow path is born,\nin thirty hours, the black lead is known.\n\nNot after heaven and earth were divided,\nbut before father and mother conceived.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every home—\nonly fools fail to see it clearly.\n\n**The Primal Great Medicine**\n\nTrust in the golden elixir—its principle most subtle,\nthis primal speck few understand.\nNot bound by wealth or poverty, it exists in every home,\nnot limited by wisdom or folly, it grows in all.\n\nSwallowed into the belly, it takes root,\nheld in the palm, it vanishes without form.\nIf the world asks me, I cannot answer—\nI point afar to the moon rising at *geng*.\n\n**Seizing the Primal**\n\nI smile to see the wondrous mystery in this land,\nwhispered secrets passed close to the ear.\nSplit open chaos to seek the gold and mercury,\ncleave the primal flood to grasp the watery lead.\n\nA grain of millet holds the northern sea,\nthe toad’s ten thousand rays illuminate the western river.\nIf one gathers and swallows it into the belly,\nhow can a mortal not become immortal?\n\n**Congealing the Primal**\n\nOnce the golden elixir is known, act at once—\nits marvel lies in this subtle essence.\nAt the Gate of the Female, a speck of true lead stirs,\nat the Mysterious Door, the three families form the foundation of creation.\n\nCongealed in the Cinnabar Field, jade leaves grow,\nreturned to the earthen crucible, immortal fungi flourish.\nIf one wishes to grasp the primal principle,\nrecognize the red flower atop the black turtle.\n\n**Recognizing and Gathering the Medicine**\n\nThe sun at the mountain’s peak, the moon in the sea’s depths,\nat the assembly on Spirit Mountain, seek the eggplant’s hue.\nFlowers bloom, birds sing—spring fills the day,\ninverted dragon’s saliva paired with tiger’s blood.\n\nDivine light pierces the Jade Pot Field,\nthe secret tally of *kun*, *shen*, *zi*, *wu* observed.\nThe blade’s master completes the great elixir in a hundred days—\nonce achieved, one becomes a wanderer of Penglai.\n\n**Direct Indication of True Lead**\n\nTrue lead is the flower of the moon,\nwest and north engender each other, one family.\nWithin the female lies the male—a treasure of power,\nfrom black comes white—the numinous sprout appears.\n\nGold abundant, water scarce—this is precious,\nyin flourishing, yang weak—nothing to boast.\nKnow too that it contains *wu* earth—\nhour by hour, the furnace’s fire stirs cinnabar.\n\n**Direct Indication of True Mercury**\n\nTrue mercury is the essence of the sun,\neast three, south two—white engenders white.\nFire hidden in wood is no idle tale,\nthe male embracing the female is the precious treasure.\n\nLet not a speck of yin turbidity stain it,\nensure the whole body shines with the great yang.\nWithin it, *ji* earth nurtures the primal qi—\nrefined, the numinous sprout gradually grows.\n\n**Lead and Mercury in Union**\n\nTrue lead and true mercury unite,\nlike lacquer and glue, their bond unending.\nMercury poured into lead is like bathing the sun,\nlead tempering mercury is like adding oil.\n\nLead harmonizes mercury’s nature, ever near,\nmercury delights in lead’s affection, joyfully swimming.\nThe five phases within and without gather in array—\nforming the red-and-white head of the great elixir.\n\n**The Wondrous Use of Inversion**\n\nSeeking truth and visiting the Dao—what difficulty?\nOnly that the human heart must know inversion.\nDo not seek the supreme medicine in mountains and forests,\none must find true lead within the city.\n\nThe Green Dragon locks *li* and *kan* in union,\nthe White Tiger draws *dui* into *qian*.\nThis art follows as he departs—\nnaturally, one walks the path with heaven at their back.\n\n**Harmonizing the Elixir Head**\n\nOnce the yellow path is born, *hai* begins,\ntrue yang must return in accord with the season.\nThe samadhi fire issues from the *li* position,\na thunderclap resounds from the *zhen* palace.\n\nQi and spirit harmonize to nurture the numinous essence,\nheart and life depend on each other to form the sacred embryo.\nOnce the inner message is grasped,\nthe three passes and nine apertures open at once.\n\n**The Three Families Meet**\n\nInvite the Yellow Dame to act as matchmaker,\nfrom nothing, something is cultivated.\nBecause the Serpent Maiden waited at that time,\nshe lured the Young Lord from without.\n\nThe two apertures communicate without obstruction,\nthe hours and palaces gather without parting.\nSuddenly, they unite in boundless harmony—\ngiving birth to an infant called the Sacred Embryo.\n\n**The Great Return of Nine Cycles**\n\nThe nine-cycle returning elixir begins with practice—\nknow that beneath the mountain, the spring is obscure.\nSetting the furnace relies on *kun* earth,\nwielding the fire depends on *xun* wind.\n\n*Dui* tiger and *zhen* dragon blend,\n*kan* man and *li* woman harmonize further.\nOnce the four images return to the center,\nthe mechanism of creation rests within me.\n\n**The Subtlety of Fire Timing**\n\nYears, months, days, hours gather in a single moment—\na moment’s lapse and yin and yang diverge.\nWithdrawing and adding follow the hare and rooster,\nthe work of ascent and descent—dragon and tiger fierce.\n\nGuard against danger, cease the fire in time,\nweigh each grain, measure each ounce like divining stalks.\nNaturally, the count completes the celestial cycle—\ndaily thus, practice for ten months.\n\n**Spiritual Transformation After Birth**\n\nThe elixir complete, my life obeys no heaven,\nmountains and valleys may shift—what care I?\nHonor and disgrace touch me not—I delight everywhere,\nprofit and fame cling not—I follow the moment’s whim.\n\nI know only the scene within the pot—heaven and earth,\nwho remembers the years of the human world?\n\n**Inquiry of the Returning Trace**\n\nShould you ask where the returning trace lies,\ndrunk, I point afar to the edge of white clouds.\n\n**Facing the Wall for Nine Years**\n\nNine years facing the wall to nurture the spirit-body,\nsilent and dim as refining the self.\nUnbound, unconstrained—freedom attained,\nfollowing conditions, knowing when to cease.\nThe heart shines vast as sun and moon,\nI and heaven-and-earth form inner and outer.\nShattering emptiness is no trifling matter,\ngathering the six directions into a millet grain.\n\n**Changing the Cauldron and Parting the Embryo**\n\nReinstalling the furnace and cauldron, establishing kun and qian,\nwith skillful hands, the elixir is moved into the upper field.\nVirtue and power ascend—spirit grows ever more transcendent,\nemptiness crumbles—dharma knows no bounds.\nFrom now on, the coarse is shed and essence restored,\nhereafter, the embryo parts and enters the mysterious.\nChildren nurture grandchildren, grandchildren nurture sons,\nold man and old woman—all ascend as immortals.\n\n**Transforming and Communing with the Numinous**\n\nNurturing the mysterious grandson until he gradually matures,\na strong lineage surpasses its ancestors in wise planning.\nLast night beneath the lamp, a fine match was made,\ntoday in the hall, a brilliant scion is born.\nEach child stands like a jade tree,\ntheir immortal descendants cluster like golden stalks.\nA company surpassing linked jade disks,\ntax-free fertile fields—self-cultivated alone.\n\n**Ninefold Spiritual Transformation**\n\nNinefold cinnabar elixir—years deepen,\nnurturing śarīra that gods and ghosts revere.\nA furnace of white snow, pure as jade,\na cauldron of yellow sprouts, finer than gold.\nOnce seen, phoenixes dance with simurghs,\nnow behold tigers roaring and dragons chanting.\nThe five metals and eight minerals all become treasures,\nrefining the celestial origin to ascend with one’s dwelling.\n\n**Cultivating the Celestial Origin**\n\nWho knows the celestial origin’s elixir grade?\nBorn from non-being—rare in the world.\nHeaven and earth serve as the furnace—true creation,\nyin and yang as the medicine—subtle and profound.\nThe chicken that eats transforms into a crane, soaring through blue clouds,\nthe dog that feeds becomes a dragon, flying in broad daylight.\nOnly here is the ultimate subtlety attained,\npermitting you to join hands and return together.\n\n**Carefree and Unfettered**\n\nThe Daoist long since dissolved ears and eyes,\ncarefree and unconstrained, free from bonds.\nAt dawn, rising with the sun at Fusang,\nat dusk, lodging at Kunlun’s cloud feet.\nHow many years since the green ox crossed the pass?\nThis Dao lies clearly before your eyes.\nLast night, after three refrains of the jade zither,\nthe wind chilled the sky, the moon shone bright.\n\n**Attaining the Dao and Delivering Others**\n\nTwin iron flutes blow through the dawn mist,\nmeeting again after how many years?\nOnce, the affairs beyond things—non-action—\nwere entrusted to the brush’s tip, never fully conveyed.\nA few white hairs—you’ve grown old!\nHow many times have I ascended the blue clouds?\nIn the world, exhaustive inquiry leads only here—\nwhy not wander together back to the grotto-heaven?\n\n**General Ode to Inner Work**\n\nPurify body and mind to refine the inner medicine,\ncultivate qi and blood to restore youthful countenance.\nBorrowing the lead cauldron to seek the true seed,\ntransmuting this mortal frame into sagely foundation.\nTen

household dwelling in the Jasper Pool.\n\n**Ode to the Prior-Heaven Cauldron**\n\nWhose daughter is this fourteen-year-old?\nHer brow radiates colorful light.\nAll crave love and desire,\nI see her as my true mother.\nA speck of numinous elixir penetrates,\nher whole body exudes fragrant sweat.\nIn an instant, she dries my mercury,\nchanging my bones into pure yang.\n\n**Twenty-Four Poems on the Golden Elixir**\n\nGathering prior-heaven to refine the posterior-heaven,\nthe two qi circulate from a shared root.\nTo know the formed as originally formless,\none must recognize the first and last crescents.\nVast and indistinct—where heaven and earth divide,\ndim and obscure—before father and mother were born.\nConsuming it, chaos remains like a dream,\ntransforming into an infant with ten thousand years of life.\n\nThe moon itself has no light—it borrows the sun’s,\neach month from new to full, yin and yang are fixed.\nToad and crow unite in true essence,\nOxherd and Weaver Girl meet in the distant haze.\nNaturally, the soul responds to the sacred spirit,\nwhile heaven and earth endure.\nIf the adept grasps the mystery within,\ntheir name and fame hang high in the Purple Palace.\n\nSeven days of yang descend the magpie bridge,\nascending the bridge, the couple roams freely.\nReversing the sea’s waters to flow into the celestial valley,\ninverting the sail to navigate the Dipper’s frame.\nHands grasp heaven and earth, dividing creation,\ntimed by years and months, pacing the celestial circuit.\nSuch are the immortal’s arts—always thus,\nnot to contend with the vulgar in idle debate!\n\nThe bellows blow, aided by the xun wind,\ndrawing kun’s fire from the primordial flood.\nGently lifting it to Kunlun’s summit,\ngradually swallowing it into the earthen cauldron’s palace.\nLead and mercury unite to form the supreme treasure,\nspirit and essence congeal into an infant.\nThus leaping beyond heaven and earth,\nno longer bound by the turning celestial sphere.\n\nEstablishing the furnace, setting the cauldron to refine the golden elixir,\nwater fears drying, fire fears cold.\nBefore forging, guard it constantly,\nat the stages of *zhun* and *meng*, observe diligently.\nWithdrawing lead, adding mercury—be vigilant,\nguard against danger, relax the profound.\nA hair’s difference and the work fails,\nabandoning halfway makes resumption difficult.\n\nDragon ascends, tiger descends—turning the river chariot,\nred fire seizes and refines the white sand.\nThe two qi congeal the embryo—lead naturally diminishes,\nthe three flowers gather at the crown—mercury returns and increases.\nOpening the furnace, stir it gently to form stalactites,\nraising the cauldron, know it as horse’s teeth.\nGrasp both substances—do not let them escape,\nreleasing them loses the golden flower’s beauty.\n\nGathering from kun’s earth where water and metal abound,\nplanting in qian’s domain, entering the river of love.\nYang fire and yin tally follow advance and retreat,\nlead dragon and mercury tiger naturally harmonize.\nNectar gathers in the east to form sweet dew,\nwine drunk in the west intoxicates with brocade.\nOnly with utmost sincerity and diligent care,\nthe embryo rounds in ten months, transforming into the azure maiden.\n\nSeizing a speck of heaven and earth’s essence,\nyin and yang unite naturally.\nHusband and wife converge, gathering the three clans,\nwu and ji intersect, clustering the five phases.\nNew and full—*zhun* and *meng*—hare and rooster leap,\ndark and crescent—tiger and dragon contend.\nHeaven and earth are gathered in the mysterious pass,\nthe river chariot turns with thunderous sound.\n\nThe body’s water and fire are yin and yang,\nthe two qi mutually embrace, transforming into purple light.\n\nDaily, the ambrosial wine of life-extension is drunk,\nhourly, the soul-returning nectar is swallowed.\nThe mystery is not for mediocre minds to know,\nthe great elixir must be tasted by the

Disciples**\n\nTo study the Dao and refine the real is to leave the worldly dust,\nroaming clouds and waters, delighting in celestial truth.\nThe numinous medicine within the body is not metal or stone,\nthe divine cinnabar in the belly is not mercury!\nThe work of gathering and refining follows the sun and moon,\nthe fire and timing of decoction match *geng* and *zu*.\nThe Yellow Dame, the matchmaker, unites the three families,\ndrinking wine, viewing flowers—spring fills the earth.\n\nGather the lead from another’s home,\nseize essence, refine qi, replenishing the prior heaven.\nEight ounces before the string, eight ounces after,\nthe inner medicine returns when the outer medicine returns.\nThe purple palace and mysterious palace drip precious dew,\nyellow sprouts and white snow transform into the golden toad.\nThe immortal’s wondrous use is ever thus—\nin fire, one can plant the nine-jointed lotus.\n\nThe initial barrier, middle barrier, and final barrier,\nlower field, middle field, and upper field.\nThe layers were originally distinct and orderly,\nthe fire’s work must follow the *qian* method.\n\nThe chamber’s windows glow bright by the third watch,\nday and night ablaze, the nine cauldrons complete.\nWith civil and martial, yin and yang, diligently refine,\ncleaving open ten thousand apertures to face the heavens.\nThe work within the body I alone know—\nwho has glimpsed the celestial mechanism’s profound mystery?\nFirst, seek the Dragon and Tiger locked in battle,\nthen behold the Tortoise and Snake joyfully following in song.\nHeaven and earth inverted, observing *pi* and *tai*,\nfire talismans rise and cease in *xu* and *wei*.\nSouth Star and North Dipper mirror front and back,\nsun and moon, Crow and Toad, fly to and fro.\n\nThe great Dao of cultivation is the ancestor of heaven and earth,\ngathering yin and yang to forge the work of creation.\nTo subdue the celestial soul and birth the White Tiger,\none must capture the earthly spirit to produce the Azure Dragon.\nCirculate the supreme treasure to the central confluence,\ntransforming the yang spirit to ascend the upper palace.\nA single *qi* condenses into one grain of elixir—\nif one can swallow it, their countenance becomes youthful.\n\nA thousand side paths branch from the Dao,\nbut without knowing the fire’s timing, all is in vain.\nFirst delve into the wondrous principle to truly awaken,\nthen bow to an enlightened master to receive the oral transmission.\nTo unite the three families in harmony,\nrely solely on the steadfastness of the Dao-heart.\nMorning and evening, forge and temper the spirit’s brilliance,\ncondensing the true spirit to ascend the nine heavens.\n\nSeeking the true requires recognizing the Void’s aperture—\nthe work lies only where intention arrives.\nComing and going, reversing and following, refine yin and yang;\nrising and descending, *kan* and *li* invert.\nVaguely, indistinctly, the Supreme Ultimate arises,\ndimly, obscurely, the

nourished,\nand yellow sprouts bloom everywhere at once.\n\nYears, months, days, and hours are but empty markers,\nhexagrams, lines, ounces, and taels are but fragments.\nIf you have grasped the ceaseless intent,\nthis is precisely the time of \"neither forgetting nor assisting.\"\n\nThe great medicine is but a single pill—\nseek its kindred pair to rejoice together.\nIf mortals ask for the secret of longevity,\nfirst seek the dual elixirs of yin and yang.\n\n**Ascending the High Terrace**\nThe wonders of the Golden Elixir’s creation are hard to express,\nwho can discern the subtle principles of the mysterious?\nFortunately, I met an enlightened master who pointed the way,\nprying open the sky within the water.\n\nFirst, he taught me to guard the mysterious pass,\ncross-legged, sitting to harmonize spirit, principle, and *qi*,\nbanishing thoughts, sealing the senses, lowering the lids.\nNext, he taught me to stir the *xun* wind,\ncirculating water and fire,\nguarding the true essence,\npreserving the original yang,\nturning the celestial pivot.\n\nThen I saw the Yellow River’s waters surging in reverse,\nflowing from *yongquan*,\nirrigating *weilu*,\nascending *jiaji* to reach *niwan*.\nPassing the Hall of Light and the Great Flower Pool,\nthe divine water gradually swelled,\ndescending the Tower of Nine Stories,\nentering the Crimson Palace,\nuntil it reached the cinnabar field.\nThis is the foundation-laying and self-refinement—\nhenceforth, one abides in the world to extend years.\n\nIf one further seeks the supreme path of ascension,\nthe master teaches to reset the furnace,\nreestablish the tripod,\ngathering the prior heaven to match the posterior.\nAt *zi* and *wu*, focus on the fire’s timing,\nat *mao* and *you*, bathe the Golden Elixir.\nFirst, he taught me to understand the mechanism of heaven and earth,\nthen to distinguish yin and yang.\nHeaven exists because of the Mother,\nwithout the Mother, there is no heaven—\nthis is the root of the great Dao.\nCount the *zhou tian* from the beginning,\ninvert *qian* and *kun* to set them right.\nDiligently refine the posterior heaven’s *yin*,\nseizing the prior heaven to become a sage or immortal.\n\nI have already bowed to an enlightened master,\nheart-to-heart transmission, mouth-to-mouth teaching.\nWhen laying the foundation, first clarify the bellows and furnace,\nwhen refining the self, use only true lead.\nThe fullness within *kan* and the emptiness within *li*—\n*li*’s void takes from *kan* to replenish.\nIn reversal, the immortal dragon swallows the tiger’s marrow;\nin sequence, the mortal tiger seizes the dragon’s saliva.\nWhat delights is the Wood Dragon concealing mercury,\nwhat is cherished is the Metal Tiger spitting lead.\nThe moon’s fullness depends on the oral formula,\nthe hour of *zi*’s wonder lies in heart transmission.\nGathering the prior heaven’s work relies entirely on *wu* and *ji*;\nseizing the posterior heaven’s brilliance begins with the Dragon and Tiger at the new moon.\nAzure Dragon and White Tiger battle,\nJade Hare and Golden Horse revolve as one.\nBeware only of lacking the wisdom sword within,\nfear only the rapids where the boat cannot be reined in.\nWait only for the Yellow Dame’s beckoning,\nawait only the Maiden’s lotus blossoming.\n\nThis matter is hard to speak of—\nwithin five thousand days, you must calculate,\nthirty *shi chen* secretly revolving.\nBefore *zi* and after *wu*, observe clearly:\nlead yang has not stirred,\n*gui* appears ahead,\ntrue lead and true yang follow behind.\nWhen the medicine arrives at the furnace,\ndo not be negligent—\nswiftly seize it and draw it into the pass,\nthen apply the six hundred refinements.\n\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete,\nthe Infant appears,\nfacing the wall for nine years,\nalone revealing the true canon—\nonly then does one become an immortal beyond Penglai and Kunlun.\n\n**Five Celestial Immortal Songs**\nFirst

death are but a thread apart,\nDragon and Tiger lie hidden in the two strings.\nExpound the mysterious *Gate of Dao and Virtue* immortal scriptures,\nplumb the *Wuzhen* sagely canon of *Wuji*.\nDiscuss how metal is born in the *geng* direction,\nspeak of how medicine arises in the *dui* position,\npoint clearly to the Crimson Continent.\nLike dew, like lightning,\nlike mist, like smoke—\nonly await the Black Tortoise’s exhalation,\nthe White Tiger’s spittle.\nSlay the Three Corpses, extinguish demonic realms,\ncapture the Five Thieves, make the horse lie down and the ape sleep.\nPursue the divine hero into the Sea of Return,\ncirculate true qi to surge through the *Yongquan*,\ngather golden essence and lodge it in the cinnabar field.\nNaturally, it will penetrate through,\nflowing through every joint of the body.\nHeart like fire,\nmind like lightning—\nnurture the golden elixir,\nmercury gradually increases, close the *dui* and forget speech.\nNine years facing the wall, work without cease,\nthe Supreme Ultimate wanders through the great thousand worlds,\nthe seven-times-returned Infant appears of itself.\nThe Six Thieves vanish,\nthe Five Phases complete their numbers,\nthe people of the four seas know to return to the Penglai gardens.\n\n**Third Body**\nFirst harmonize the breath,\nthen unite metal and wood.\nLead essence conceals itself in the transforming gate,\nmercury fluid hides in the mysterious portal—\nthe root of creation.\nIn the profound darkness, there is a sign;\nin the indistinct, nothing to see or hear.\nNurture the medicine sprout, ever keep the furnace whole,\npluck the yellow sprout, never let the crucible be damaged.\nEnsure the original spirit does not stray from the square inch,\nseek golden water to irrigate Kunlun.\nRely on the wisdom sword to pursue and press the demon hordes,\nseal the Three Treasures, hold the heart and mind with care,\ncapture the Five Thieves, diligently refine the self.\nSever greed and wrath, dispel ten thousand cares,\nencounter the passing scene without staining a single dust.\nI only await—\non the winding river, the moon spitting forth *gengshen*,\nin the mountain’s form, treading snow to seek spring.\nGather golden essence only when leaving the Crimson Waters,\nharmonize true breath to circulate through the whole body,\ncirculate one’s own mercury to envelop yang essence.\nThe furnace fire ever warm,\nhour by hour, moment by moment, advance with precision.\nLike the foolish, like the dull,\nsit in silence, forget speech,\nguard poverty and preserve the whole truth.\nI turn to the deep mountains, facing the wall where none inquire,\nin the quiet chamber, with ashen heart, only I am intimate.\nRegulate spirit and breath,\nrely on our teachings—\nnot speaking of ten months’ gestation,\nonly nine years of toil,\ntoday the work is complete, the merit full, only then is the original nature realized.\n\n**Fourth Body**\nLeisurely peruse the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*,\nquietly contemplate the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*—\noriginally, lead is but one flavor,\nfalsely given many names.\nIt lurks in the water’s depths,\nbestowed upon the crown of *Xiyi*,\nresiding in the transforming pit.\nScarlet, it hides in sweet springs,\nclosely packed, it conceals itself in the cinnabar well.\nI only await—\nat the Winter Solstice, when the first yang stirs,\nat the Autumn Equinox, when the two heroes ascend.\nThe Flowery Pond has its sign, the mysterious pearl bursts forth,\nact with benevolence, establish virtue,\nset up justice, prepare punishments,\nguard against deception,\nlure and seduce with joyful passions.\nObserve the Crimson Continent, qi flourishing, yang surging,\nsee the Scarlet County, *gui* stirring, lead arising.\nScarlet, the Dragon’s head erects,\ncrimson, the Tortoise’s eye opens round,\nblack, the Tiger’s mouth emits sound.\nContending to display their powers,\nmake yin and yang invert,\nunite metal and wood.\nSeize the Dark Warrior’s tortoise essence from the north,\nlock it in the Yellow Court.\nBathe often, sweep the Three Fields to stillness,\nnurture with warmth, ensure the nine transformations are numinous.\nAccumulate eight hundred deeds of hidden virtue,\nname inscribed in the Upper Clarity,\nspirit ascends to Jade Capital,\nfeasting concludes, drunk on peaches of immortality.\n\n**Fifth Body**\nNo indulgence for the wild mind-steed,\nhow could the heart-ape be released?\nThe Three Corpses cause no disturbance,\nthe Six Thieves all submit.\nDemon realms all forgotten—\npreserve robust spirit,\nharmonize strong qi and blood.\nAll cares forgotten, greed and wrath left behind,\nten thousand ties severed, no false thoughts arise.\nEncounter the divine maiden tending the furnace to forge the sword,\nborrow golden water to pair hardness and softness.\nRely on the craftsman’s hand to capture and seize as easily as turning a palm,\nunlock the knife and key,\nuntie the Dragon and Tiger’s reins.\nDrink the immortal wine of extended years,\nconsume the jade liquor of continued life.\nElixir enters the abdomen, fragrance arises throughout the body,\npassion returns to nature, bones revert to yang.\nStill the heart’s scenery, seal the earthen crucible,\nextinguish the mind’s spring, close the grotto chamber.\nFar from sound and color, firmly guard the true constant,\nguard against harm—\nif encountered, do not lightly lose.\nAfter ten months,\nthe Infant descends,\nnurtured to spiritual communion,\nmeeting the spirit, alone roams the immortal realm.\nWho knows the vastness of heaven and earth in stillness?\nI love the long days and months within the gourd.\nLet the world’s slander and praise be—\ndonning cloud robes and crane cloaks,\nholding elixir texts and jade chapters,\nthe immortals of the Purple Palace celebrate together.\n\n**First of the Four \"Branch of Flowers\"**\n**First Body**\n\n**Second Body**\n\nCrafting the work of creation’s power,\nfirst set hand to harmonize primordial qi.\nSince receiving the master’s transmission,\nalone I guard non-action.\nJade nectar ever refined,\nprimordial essence returns to the true seat.\nPiercing the three barriers, passing Tail Gate,\nthe river chariot reverses upward to Mud Pill.\nStriking Kunlun, thunder shakes like a roar,\nsweet springs flow fragrant as honeyed isles.\nEntering the Jade Pool, transformed to golden liquid,\ncarefree, I drink the self-dripping sweet dew.\nDescending the twelve-tiered tower,\nfirmly sealed and steadfastly guarded—\nall is but the three: essence, qi, and spirit.\nReturning to the root, restoring life,\nall is but the five: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth gathered.\nWithin the mysterious, the mystery—\nthe immortal elixir of non-death;\nwithin the wondrous, the wonder—\nthe root of life’s extension.\nWho does not walk this path? Who does not know?\nWho does not practice? All are lost\nin seeking the precelestial aperture—\nhow could they dare reckless action?\n\nI, too, amidst the flowers,\ndrum bamboo and pluck the zither, heart like still water.\nFrom now on, having grasped the true message,\nforgetting things, forgetting form,\nbefore midnight and after noon may be held,\nin the hours of Mao and You, the time of bathing.\nWhat need to speak of the wheel of life and death?\nWhat need to speak of the maiden and infant?\nAll is but the gathering—\nthe primordial chaos before separation, a single grain of millet.\n\n**Third Body**\n\nHeart like a lotus rising from water,\nintent swift as lightning in the clouds.\nLast night, over a small matter,\nI strayed into the spring courtyard.\nMoment by moment, rein in the mind-horse,\ninstant by instant, lock the heart-ape.\nDay and night without sleep,\ntempering the self, work unceasing.\nSeal the Three Treasures within the Yellow Chamber,\ncapture the Five Thieves beyond the Upper Court.\nCommand self and other to be thus—steady, unshaken,\nmake yin and yang overturn, invert.\nWithdraw the host of demons, raise the keen-edged sword,\ndare to pluck the fresh blossoms beyond the wall,\nhang up my mother-born iron face—\nI let them stir not the slightest.\n\nDelicate celestial form,\nten fingers slender,\ncannot sway my mind-horse or heart-ape.\nI am a touchstone—\nhigh or low, instantly revealed;\nI am an iron steamed bun—\nhard to bite, harder to chew;\nI am a sea of purity—\nnot a speck of dust clings;\nI am a luminous pearl—\never suspended in emptiness.\n\nThe Dao firm, the will far-reaching,\nfrom youth I tempered body and mind.\nCut off fame and profit, no greed remains,\nseize the Three Corpses, seethe them in the cauldron.\nMy heart is steadfast,\nmy mastery of creation unseen by others.\nI worry—lest the work go unfulfilled, the name unmade,\ntime pass in vain;\nI worry—lest the sun and moon race like shuttles, praising youth.\nOne day, turning the heavenly gate,\nsoaring midair,\nonly then shall I expound the cold, aloof family tradition of the Daoist teaching.\n\nFirst discern the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,\nthen match yin and yang in their pairing.\nBefore Heaven there was the Mother;\nwithout the Mother, there would be no Heaven—\nthis is the root-source of the Daoist teaching.\nCount the celestial cycles from the beginning,\ninvert qian and kun to set them aright.\nThe moon’s fullness lies in the oral formula,\nthe hour of zi’s mystery in heart-transmission.\nI raise my sword of edge-less sharpness—\nwhat I fear is the rushing rapids where boats stall,\nwhat I sense is the Yellow Dame’s beckoning,\nwhat I await is the Maiden’s unfolding lotus—\nthis matter is hard to speak of.\nFive thousand days, close-calculated with steadfast heart,\nthirty hours, silently revolving in the dark.\nI stand the Dragon’s Head upright,\nhe suspends the Moon’s Grotto in emptiness.\nDisplaying divine power, I plant lotuses in raging fire,\nwielding the craftsman’s hand, I pole a boat against the current.\nI do not envy lovely, delicate flowers,\nonly long for the sweet dew and sacred spring.\nAssault the Divine Continent, breach the Crimson County,\nseize the Golden Essence and lead it carefully,\nescort it into the Cinnabar Field.\nGuard against danger, dispel stray thoughts,\nbathe in spontaneity.\nAfter nine years facing the wall,\nI become an immortal beyond the world—\ndwelling in Penglai’s paradise.\n\n---\n\nIn quest of the Great Dao’s mystery,\nI wandered to the ends of the earth.\nCast aside fame, power, and profit,\nabandoned home, estate, and fields.\nThrough myriad hardships,\nrobes torn, shoes worn, I could barely face my master.\nI worried—lest sixty or seventy years of life be too brief,\nuntil entering Zhongnan, I received the Fire Dragon’s oral transmission.\nCommanded to leave the mountain, seek companions, and quest for lead,\nI visited renowned worthies—\nall proved cunning, miserly, and thieving of the Dao’s mystery.\nYet it was my destined karmic cause to emerge in this world,\nand fortunately, I met Shen Wansan, generous and true.\nAlas, his strength was insufficient to complete the work,\nso I had no choice but to tend the furnace and refine the elixir.\nAfter nine revolutions, I went to the Pleasure Garden to gather herbs and enact talismans,\nthen spent five years on Mount Wudang.\nFacing the wall, I harmonized spirit for another nine years,\nwhen suddenly I heard the imperial summons.\nI wished to avoid the emperor’s presence,\nbut feared for Minister Hu’s life.\nRiding clouds, I ascended to the Court of the Rising Sun,\nwhere the sovereign’s dragon countenance lit with joy.\nI longed to transmit the teaching mouth-to-mouth,\nbut feared violating the Jade Emperor’s decree—\nso I mounted the phoenix and rode the simurgh to the Ninth Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on Golden Flowers**\n\nGolden flowers, fresh and bright,\nwithout wealth, cultivation is hard.\nI dare not speak of it to others,\neach must calculate for themselves.\nSeeking external protectors, I found no worthy sages,\nso I held fast to the celestial mechanism for years.\nTesting and verifying, wondrous and profound,\nrelying on the sword of wisdom, I gathered the primordial.\nOnly now do I know—\nthe Dao lies before me,\nand I truly believe the Golden Elixir has an orthodox transmission.\nI play the flute without holes,\nstrum the stringless zither.\nI delight in yellow sprouts and white snow,\ncherish the first scripture and red lead.\nI drink the wine of life-extension,\nconsume the soul-returning divine pill.\nI engage in the work within the flask,\nplay with the golden toad at the sea’s bottom.\nSeizing sun and moon, I refine them in the furnace,\nwresting qian and kun, I seethe them in the crucible.\nThis is my true method of cultivation,\nthe skill of one who has left the household.\nI regret that in the past,\nlacking money, I pleaded with Heaven day and night—\npitiful indeed!\nBut now, fortune has turned,\nand I await only the completion of merit and perfection of work,\nto cast off all and become a carefree immortal beyond the world.\n\nGolden flowers, jade buds—fresh and bright,\nhard for the world to distinguish.\nFor immortality, one must subdue qi,\nfor grafting, true lead is essential.\nLay the foundation, refine the self,\ngather postnatal jade liquid to return the elixir.\nEven if one attains longevity in this world,\none must still seek the ninefold return of golden liquid.\nHow laughable are the multitudes who study immortality—\neach one blindly cultivating without sight,\nstep by step, who understands true investigation and real inquiry?\nThroughout Heaven and Earth, yellow sprouts grow everywhere,\nacross the cosmos, white blossoms bloom in profusion—\nall await the moment when water is exhausted, gold is born, and the moon is full.\nHere, I raise my precious sword and hang it on South Mountain,\nslaying the seven emotions and six desires,\nsweeping away the ten thousand miles of floating clouds,\nleaving not a speck of dust.\nThe Five Ghosts and Three Corpses tremble in fear.\nI invert yin and yang,\nuse divine strategy to secretly harmonize the eight trigrams of the celestial cycle,\ncaution body and mind, guard against danger.\nGently, I shake the earth’s axis,\nslowly, I turn the heavenly gate—\nthen, with a thunderclap, a heaven beyond heaven appears.\n\n---\n\n**A Formula of Celestial Mechanism**\n\nI tell you the true oral formula,\npoint to the moon at the sky’s edge.\nWhen the moon is full, the jade bud emerges;\nwhen the moon wanes, the golden flower falls.\nAt the third and fifth phases, observe the seasons,\ndistinguish carefully between old and young.\nSend it into the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nlest it leak and escape.\nGraft and graft again—\nthe spirit turtle drinks the golden horse’s blood to the last drop.\nDecisively, decisively—\nbecome a guest of Penglai’s three isles.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Mystic Union at the Pass**\n\nThe Great Dao is beyond words,\nits wondrous principle hard to exhaust—\na single point at the mystic pass is the Dharma’s secret.\nFrom the Kunlun’s mud-pill peak above,\nto the bubbling spring cave below,\nlead is the mother, mercury the father.\nLead and mercury, yin and yang, form the child’s bond,\nthe Alchemical Girl and Infant rest together.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Yin-Yang Union**\n\nInvert kan within li,\ndragon and tiger meet in wind and cloud.\nA single point of wondrous mystery embraces Heaven and Earth,\nyet people great and small know nothing of it—\nreturning three, revolving five, they penetrate the celestial mechanism.\nLi returns to kan, kan returns to li,\nkan and li, water and fire, move east and west.\nInfant and Alchemical Girl become husband and wife.\nYin steals yang’s essence to take kan’s solidity,\nyang subdues yin’s spirit to fill li’s emptiness—\nthree threes and six sixes divide Heaven and Earth.\nThese practices are not easy,\ntransforming qian and kun risks leaking primordial qi.\n\n---\n\n**Six Refrains of the Grotto’s Pure Chant**\n\nI long to split open the primordial chaos,\ncleave the vast misty aperture.\nI long to find a drop of life-continuing nectar,\nseek a sprig of soul-returning herb.\nI see the tiger’s roar summon the tide,\ngui stirs and the medicine sprouts.\nThe Yellow Dame teaches with her zither,\nthe Metal Elder taps his bamboo clappers.\nUnawares, the Cinnabar Field grows hot—\nthe life-treasure has returned to the Yellow Path.\n\nAt that moment, harmonize spirit and breath,\nin stillness watch water and fire intertwine.\nI take up the bottomless basket, borne by another’s strength,\nI cradle the stringless zither in my arms.\nGently I pluck the crimson phoenix’s head—\n*heh heh*—piercing the black turtle’s aperture.\nSeizing yang qi, crossing the Magpie Bridge,\nmoving yin talismans, swiftly enfolding them.\nSuddenly the Mud Pill Palace boils like scalding soup,\nthe Cinnabar Field burns like fire.\nSetting up *zhun* and *meng*, forgetting dawn and dusk,\npervading the four limbs, steaming them through.\nShould demonic visions arise to beckon,\nhere I remain, sitting in suchness, unshaken.\n\nTemper the self, pacifying the Five Thieves,\nshift the scenery, merging the Seven Emotions.\nSubduing the Six Desires to stillness,\nsweeping the Three Fields clean.\nNature settles and naturally becomes numinous,\nthe heart empties and inwardly shines bright.\nMatching hardness and softness,\ngold and water meet to balance yin and yang, moving in reversal.\nOnce the *jiji* work is complete,\nthe ten thousand spirits all heed command.\nHearing the decree, ascending in flight,\nthe name is already inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace.\n\nI only await concealing myself in the marketplace to silently cultivate;\nI only await choosing a propitious place to put it into practice;\nI only await wielding the sword of wisdom to nurture the white snow,\nrelying on the craftsman’s hand to plant the yellow sprout;\nI only await moving fire to refine true emptiness,\nseeking light to break through the vast misty aperture;\nI only await gathering the two qi to return to the Li Chamber,\ngathering one yang to enter the Zhen Palace.\n\nFollowing Master Jingyang’s footsteps,\nsoaring aloft riding the cinnabar phoenix;\nemulating the Yellow Emperor’s divine powers,\nascending in flight astride the fire dragon.\nGathering lead essence,\npairing it with mercury sprouts,\nerecting the crucible and furnace,\ncultivating the mysteries’ essentials.\nSeizing the creative mechanism of qian and kun,\ngrasping the wondrous waxing and waning of sun and moon.\nUniting water and fire, burning left and right,\ndirecting hun and po to intermingle and exchange.\nFollowing the four seasons without missing their sequence,\naccord with the eight nodes, responding to the hexagrams’ lines.\nDiscerning dawn and dusk, clarifying growth and decline,\nobserving the heavenly Dao, completing twelve circuits of the celestial sphere.\nThe Seven-Return Great Pearl illuminates the nature,\nthe Nine-Return Golden Elixir completes the Great Medicine.\nWith a thunderous crack,\nthe Perfected One emerges from the crown.\n\n**Two Chants on the Hibernating Dragon Method**\n\n*Fisherman’s Song*\nThe hibernation method is soundless yet resounding,\nthe resounding sound speaks to the inner heart.\nSpirit silent, qi obscure,\nthe hibernating dragon, though asleep, remains awake.\n\n*Hibernating Dragon’s Chant*\nSleeping immortal, sleeping immortal,\nhighly reclining at the stone’s root, forgetting the years.\nThe Three Lights sink and merge, nature becomes whole.\nQi after qi returns to the mysterious aperture,\nbreath after breath follows nature’s course.\nDo not scatter, must be tranquil,\nnurturing the mercury nature to perfection,\nawaiting the appearance of the lead flower.\nNo loss, with vigilance,\ntrue fire timing, moving in between.\nPracticing the Seven Returns is not difficult,\nrefining the Nine Returns—why sigh?\nSilently watching the dragon and tiger’s battlefield,\nsecretly reversing yin and yang.\nPeople say I am a blind dragon of the Han,\nyet I sleep, commanding sleep, not truly asleep.\nOnce mastered, the true reclining meditation,\nonce nurtured, the true primordial embryo—\nthe hibernating dragon rises and ascends to heaven.\n\nThis hibernation method—who transmitted it?\nFolding arms for a pillow, from Confucius’ mountain,\ndelighting in its midst, unknown to others.\nFive dragons leap and soar from the deep pool,\nHeaven bestowed this method to Tu Nan.\nWho in Tu Nan’s lineage can continue it?\nThe slovenly Daoist Zhang Fengxian.\n\n**Two Lyrics of the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring**\n\nIn the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring, the moon’s wheel hangs high,\njade trees bloom anew, breaking the silence.\nAt midnight the elixir furnace is opened,\nat the third watch the Dipper’s handle is turned.\nWho has reached the Silver River of the Han?\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl laugh from heaven’s edge.\nIn the Purple Mansion, the immortals gather—\nreturn, return, the worldly filth is cleansed.\n\nAgain,\nIn the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring, the sun’s brilliance is clear,\nthe golden liquid and returned elixir are already refined.\nTo make emotion return to nature,\nmust merge nature with emotion.\nWealth and honor, fame and merit—ask no more,\nthe Infant and Alchemical Girl are most enchanting.\nThe furnace and cauldron radiate light—\nfrom here, journey to the Kunlun’s summit.\n\n**West River Moon**\nThe Dao resides in the mysterious pass’s aperture,\nthe aperture contains primordial qi and primordial essence.\nPrimordial essence and primordial qi nurture the primordial spirit,\nwhen the spirit is full, movement and stillness arise naturally.\nMovement and stillness, three revolutions and nine transformations,\ncirculating through the changes of qian and kun.\nReversing qian and kun to plant the flower’s root,\nthe root sprouts, the four rivers’ moon is full.\n\n**Partridge Sky**\nTo battle demons, first battle the sleep demon,\nthis is the first whip in cultivation.\nDiligently enduring one night’s toil,\nin the pot, months change over a thousand years.\nThe work of laying the foundation requires steadfast resolve,\nmust rely on the mysterious female to seek the mysterious within the mysterious.\nWhen spirit returns and qi is restored, the elixir body forms,\nonly then open the furnace to discuss refining lead.\n\n**Two Self-Inscriptions on the “Rootless Tree” Lyrics**\n\n*Partridge Sky*\nThe counterflow method spreads, both orthodox and heterodox,\nentering heterodoxy and forsaking orthodoxy pervades the world.\nFew soar like phoenixes piercing the clouds,\nmany drown like frogs fallen in wells.\nHard to distinguish, chaotic clamor—\nall take red earth for cinnabar.\nTo know the true path to the mysterious,\nstudy closely the flowers beneath the rootless tree.\n\n*Cry of the Flower Seller*\nBeneath the rootless tree, speaking of the true constant,\nthe six paths merge with spirit, sharing one light.\nUnderstanding matters before and after the Sound of Thunder,\noriginally without coming or going, majestic in form.\n\n**Twenty-Four Daoist Songs of the Rootless Tree**\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in seclusion—\nwho, enamored of the red dust, would cultivate?\nFloating life’s affairs are a bitter sea’s boat,\ndrifting to and fro, not free.\nBoundless and shore-less, hard to moor,\nalways swimming in the perilous realm of fish and dragons.\nIf willing to turn back, that is the shore—\ndo not wait for the wind and waves to wreck your boat.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers delicate—\nthe old tree renews itself with tender branches.\nPeaches grafted to willows,\nmulberries grafted to pears,\npassed down as models for those who cultivate the true.\nSince ancient times, immortals’ grafting methods—\nwhen people grow old, there is medicine to heal.\nSeek a bright teacher, inquire of the myriad methods—\nbeginning practice is already too late.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers verdant—\nflower and wine immortals have claimed them to this day.\nThe brothel’s stronghold,\nthe forest within wine—\nnot violating the precepts against meat and lust.\nViolating lust loses the treasure of long life,\nmeat and wine pass through the intestines, yet the Dao is in the heart.\n\nOpen the gate, I speak to you—\nwithout wine, without flowers, the Dao cannot be fulfilled.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers solitary—\nI ask: do yin and yang find their kind?\nA hen’s egg cannot hatch a chick,\nfor it has turned its back on the furnace of yin and yang.\nA woman without a husband is a resentful maiden,\na man without a wife is a forsaken bachelor.\nAlas for the deluded, so utterly confused—\nsitting in stillness, cultivating alone, their qi withers dry.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers askew—\nsevered from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.\nGold is cut off from wood, mercury from lead,\nyang widowed, yin orphaned—each to its own side.\nIn the world, yin and yang pair man with woman,\nbegetting sons and grandsons, generation after generation.\nFollowing the flow, one becomes a mortal;\nreversing it, one becomes an immortal—\nall lies in the turning of the cheek.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers newly bloomed—\nborn in the direction of *kun*, and *kun* is human.\nPluck the flower, wear it;\ngather the flower’s heart,\nits layered pistils bright with spring’s splendor.\nYet people do not grasp the principle within the flower—\na single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\nBorrow the flower’s name, embody the flower’s form,\neach line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* speaks truly.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in full bloom—\ntheir smiling faces, delicate features like powdered petals.\nGuard against the monkey and horse, ever more stubborn—\nhang up the iron mask your mother gave you.\nDraw forth the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon,\npluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall.\nHoist the wind-filled sail, return fully laden—\nhow could one journey empty-handed to the mountain of treasure!\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers taking flight—\nonce shed, they open again at the appointed time.\nWhen lead’s flower appears, when *gui* is exhausted,\nonce more the western garden’s branches brim with blossoms.\nJust gathered beneath the moon,\nthey are already mended into robes at dawn’s first light.\nThis mystery is rarely known in the world—\nit must be pondered carefully with the immortals.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in full bloom—\nplucked from within the crescent-moon furnace.\nThey extend life, lessen illness and calamity—\nfind good companions, prepare the means for the method.\nFrom this, the treasure of heaven may be achieved—\nlet the deluded masses laugh at my folly.\nI urge the wise: do not feign cleverness,\nwithout a bright teacher, do not force guesses.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers perfectly round—\nthe fruit ripens, its flavor complete.\nLike a crimson tangerine, like a pellet,\nguard it well, never let down your vigilance.\nLearn the method of plants gathering their essence—\nreturn to life, revert to the root, restore the origin.\nChoose a sacred site, build a Daoist hermitage,\nunite with the primordial to accomplish the great return.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers flourishing—\nspeaking of rootlessness, yet it has roots.\nThe three talents’ apertures, the two true essences—\nwhen heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born.\nWhen sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order;\nwhen man and woman unite, conception begins.\nHow clear this is—\nI tell you plainly,\nonly fear that when you meet it, you will not recognize it truly.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers at their finest—\nfacing the scene, forget emotion, admire the moon’s radiance.\nThe golden essence flourishes, dazzling the eye—\ndo not mistakenly pick the wrong melon in the garden.\nThe five metals and eight minerals are all false,\nthe ten thousand herbs and thousand grasses are all amiss.\nThe golden toad, the jade crow—\nrecognize true lead, and you are the master.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers abundant—\nwhen they bloom everywhere, they span the river of desire.\nHard to pluck, what can be done?\nStep by step, tread the dragon and tiger’s den.\nHaving gathered the yellow flower, return to the cave—\nyour name inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.\nLaughing heartily, oh white clouds—\nprepare the ladder to ascend the Great Canopy.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers fragrant—\nin the warm lead crucible, the treasure’s light appears.\nOn the golden bridge, gaze toward the winding river—\nin the moon, the sun is clearly seen.\nSwallow the raven’s liver and hare’s marrow,\nreplace all the dust and grime of your old intestines.\nThe realm of fame and profit,\nthe land of love and attachment—\nnever turn back, ceaselessly rushing in vain.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers fresh—\ntalisman fire sears mercury and lead together.\nAt the furnace’s edge, the scene appears before you—\ngathering depends entirely on the ferryboat of the method.\nA master craftsman, strong and steady, holds the helm,\nno matter how the vast waves churn in the sea’s depths.\nPass the three barriers, penetrate the mud pill,\nearly on, pierce the nine apertures of the entire body.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers rich—\nrecognize true lead as the primal ancestor.\nEssence, vitality, spirit—\nrefined together in one crucible,\nthe woman transforms into man, the old into youth.\nWishing to capture the White Tiger in the west,\nfirst subdue the Azure Dragon in the east.\nWhen kinds are alike, apply effort well—\nwhen the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers delicate—\nthe tree of heaven’s root, its flowers fair.\nHeaven responds with stars, earth with tides.\nThe dragon-slaying sword, the tiger-binding cord—\nrevolve the celestial pivot, turn the Dipper’s handle.\nTemper a furnace of true sun and moon,\nsweep away the three thousand six hundred paths.\nStep into the clouds, roam freely—\nall sins, all worldly dust, are wiped away in one stroke.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers towering—\nocean waves surge to the sky, the moon plays with the tide.\nThe path of the Silver River,\npiercing the nine heavens,\na ladder climbs the void to moor at the Dipper’s handle.\nTouch the Weaving Maiden’s loom stone,\ntread the Cowherd’s magpie bridge.\nMeeting the immortals’ court, with bold courage,\nsteal the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in pairs—\ndragon and tiger mount the altar, battling fiercely.\nLead enters mercury,\nyin matches yin—\nthe image of the mysterious pearl, its price beyond value.\nThis is the true seed of the homeland,\nreturning the old to youth, lengthening life.\nAscend to heaven, to the land of ultimate bliss—\nspare yourself the wheel of rebirth, the sight of Yama.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers wondrous—\ncultivated in the moon for a brief moment.\nThe hand that grasps clouds, the ladder that climbs them—\ngather the first primordial branch.\nDrinking wine with flowers, the spirit is refreshed,\nlaughing at the immortal elder drunk as mud.\nEntrust your heart to knowledge, guard it carefully—\nonly fear the furnace’s fire timing will fly away.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers golden—\nborn in the central land of *wu* and *ji*.\nThe eastern family’s daughter, the western family’s son—\nmatched as husband and wife, they enter the bridal chamber.\nThe Yellow Dame urges them to drink the ghee-like wine,\neach day intoxicated, steaming with drunkenness.\nThis immortal formula, this soul-returning nectar—\nthe Medicine King who revives the dead and restores life.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers radiant—\nthe moon’s essence, heaven’s heart, presses upon the sun’s soul.\nThe golden crow’s marrow, the jade hare’s essence—\nseize these two, refine them together in one vessel.\n\nThe yang fire and yin tally divide at *zi* and *wu*,\nbathing rites arrive at the gates of *mao* and *you*.\nGuard the Yellow Court, nurture the Valley Spirit—\na man conceives the embryo, laughing to scorn.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers crimson—\npluck all its red blossoms, leaving the tree bare.\nEmptiness is form, form is emptiness,\ndiscern true emptiness within form.\nOnce true emptiness is realized, form vanishes,\nyet the Dharma-body endures, never falling into void.\n\nNamed Perfect Penetration, called the Great Hero,\nnine generations ascend to the ninefold heavens.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers now absent—\nshadowless, formless, hard to depict in images.\nNameless, yet heeding the call,\nseized into the crucible of creation.\nCirculate the Samadhi fire of the Celestial Cycle,\ntemper true emptiness to return to the Great Void.\n\nVisit the immortal capital, receive the celestial tally—\nonly then is one a true man, a great husband.\n\n*Four Seasons’ Daoist Sentiments* – Four Poems\n\n**Spring**\nSpring’s hues delight the heart,\npeach and apricot blossoms renew the eye.\nThe mountain garden’s fresh scenes,\nbehold—no cares or sorrows.\nImmortals rejoice in touring grotto-heavens in spring.\nMaster Zi Jin plays his jade flute,\nthe jade flute’s notes for the knowing ear.\nAs for me, when leisure comes,\nI burn a censer of incense, pluck a tune on the zither.\n\n**Summer**\nSummer’s lotus pools, lotus pools,\na pair of mandarin ducks skims the water’s surface.\nArranged in couples,\ncool winds and moonlit nights for carefree play.\nImmortals rejoice in Lü Zu’s meeting with Zhongli,\nthe two elders leaving behind the land of longevity.\nOn Mount Zhongnan, they ride the clouds away.\nAs for me, when leisure comes,\nI burn a censer of incense, play a game of chess.\n\n**Autumn**\nAutumn’s sparse clouds, sparse clouds,\ndistant peaks yellow, trees’ leaves withered.\nNight reveals the Silver River’s spread,\nthe Herd-boy comes to ferry the Weaver Girl.\nImmortals rejoice in the fortune-teller’s seclusion in Chengdu,\nMaster Junping raises his jade flask,\ndaily earning a hundred coins to buy wine.\nAs for me, when leisure comes,\nI burn a censer of incense, read a scroll of scripture.\n\n**Winter**\nWinter’s flying snow, flying snow,\nten thousand *li* of passes and mountains like jade heaps.\nHe Jing hides in his hut to sleep,\nin the cold, cranes guard solitary Mount Gu.\nImmortals rejoice in Han Xiang’s conversion of Master Wen,\nthough repeatedly urged to turn back, he would not,\nonly meeting on the road to Blue Pass.\nAs for me, when leisure comes,\nI light a stick of incense, paint a plum tree.\n\nThese *Four Seasons’ Daoist Sentiments* were composed by me in reclusion on Mount Zhongnan, to sing for myself. Together they adopt the style of *Bamboo Branch* songs—each stanza a hard stop, appearing disjointed, yet their subtlety lies precisely in the connection of disconnection.\n\nSelf-inscribed.\nLeft in inscription at Green Goat Palace.\n\nSeeking old friends across the ends of the earth, yet none appear—\nI sigh at those deluded fools who would learn to be immortals.\nSome cling to stubborn emptiness,\nwith yin but no yang, a solitary refinement;\nsome rely on crucibles and vessels,\ndiscarding life and death to prattle of \"harvesting and battle.\"\nEach grasps but one corner,\nthe Mysterious Pass unknown to them all.\nDo not dress up *wuwei* as mere pretense—\nall is but an empty facade.\nHow might one find cloud companions and rosy-hued friends,\nto blend with the world and harmonize its light for a few years?\n\nTo seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,\nfor the Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,\nand immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.\nRefining millet grains requires both method and resources;\nmatters of the heart and belly demand two or three trusted companions.\nHow might one find a Zhang Huanwei to discourse on the Mysterious,\nor a Ma Banzhou to cultivate refinement together?\nXue Daoguang once returned to the secular,\nwhile Wang Chongyang was fortunate to meet a true affinity.\nElder Bai Duan sought friends in Fufeng County,\nand Patriarch Bodhidharma attained the Dao in a pleasure garden.\nOnly then does one realize that the streets of flowers and willows are just as fit for Chan inquiry—\nno more talk of \"pure emptiness\" and \"effortless non-action\" in idle sitting.\n\nTo seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,\nfor the Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,\nand immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.\nSeeking a true master with earnest devotion, countless times—\nall claim to have received authentic transmission,\nsome immortal and their dharma kin.\nOne speaks of mending the Upper Field,\nanother of replenishing the Lower Origin.\nOne insists that guarding the Central Yellow is the true Dharma-eye,\nwhile mocking those who take the space between the two kidneys as the Mysterious Pass.\nWith such a thousand doors and ten thousand gates,\non a hundred-foot pole, countless worthy souls have been misled.\nTo seek the Way, one must seek the Primordial.\nThe Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,\nand immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.\n\nLet those who would learn immortality heed my words—\nnever blindly cultivate or recklessly refine.\nOne must understand the inner and outer yin and yang,\nand what thing of like kind they are.\nOne must refine yin and yang in accord with yin and yang,\nand cultivate the world-transcending in accord with worldly dharmas.\nFollowing the flow, one becomes human;\nreversing it, one becomes immortal—\na single phrase surpasses thousands upon thousands.\nNo more talk of \"pure emptiness\" and \"effortless non-action,\"\nfor without obtaining the Reverted Elixir, all is in vain.\n\nTo seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,\nfor the Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,\nand immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.\n\n*Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments*\n**First Watch**\nAlone I herd the green ox,\nnever letting it run wild or wander idly.\nHere I shift scenes and alter moods,\nplucking flowers and breaking willows,\nsecretly refining and cultivating in seclusion.\nClosing the six gates, I guard stillness with *wuwei*,\ncapturing the five thieves with method to bind and imprison.\nMatching hardness with softness,\nenduring the cycles of spring and autumn.\nWith spirit full and flourishing, I stand complete.\n\n**Second Watch**\nWhy fear herb-gathering?\nAt the second watch, harmonize and blend.\nDrive away the host of yin,\nbanish the legion of demons.\nI only seek to lure the phoenix to its nest,\ncall the tortoise back to its cave,\nguide the tiger home to its den.\nWhen lead stirs, guard it with care;\nwhen the moon appears, recognize its truth.\nStrike not amiss.\nGazing afar, time passes—\nthe Red Waters merge with the Pearl.\nHow wondrous the workings of creation!\n\n**Third Watch**\nAt the third watch, the first yang begins to sprout.\nThe gates of the Red Continent swing open,\nthe true adept ascends.\nNow the lead’s luster faintly gleams,\nthe jade bud first enfolds,\nhalf-revealing its golden essence.\nBind the heart-ape—dragons chant in clouded response;\ntether the will-horse—tigers roar as winds arise.\nPluck a sprig of magic fungus,\nbear it to the Yellow Court,\nseal it fast—no cause for fear.\nA hundred days, and the work bears fruit.\n\n**Fourth Watch**\nAt the fourth watch, the last drops of ghee are drunk.\nRiding the raft, Zhang Qian laughs,\nwhile Ma Gu is left in astonishment.\nWith this single drop, irrigate the Three Fields,\nfuse the hundred meridians,\nmoisten flesh and skin.\nCirculate through the sturdy Passes and earthen crucible,\nascend and descend—guard as before.\nAll thoughts of loyalty vanish,\nsounds and sights dissolve.\nNurture the fetal immortal—\nten months’ labor.\n\n**Fifth Watch**\nAt the fifth watch, add mercury and draw forth lead,\nexchange the crucible, divide the elixir,\nmove the elixir to the Upper Field.\nFrom now on, yang waxes as yin wanes,\nnature is perfected, life is whole,\nthe body firm, the form enduring.\nQuietly harmonize the spirit—its unity gradually expands;\ndiligently face the wall—nine years return to the origin.\nWhen deeds are complete and merit full,\neight hundred and three thousand—\nunited with the Dao, true as an immortal.\n\n---\n\n**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**\n\n**First Watch**\nLead and mercury complete,\nthe Three Corpses and Six Thieves all scatter.\nHeart-ape and will-horse firmly bound,\nthe lead crucible warm, never cold.\nNo demon dares lift its head.\nCalm the spirit, rest at ease—let nature take its course.\nThe dragon chants of its own,\nthe tiger rejoices on its own.\nMaster this wondrous principle through steadfast practice,\nfire and water paired as *li* and *kan* throughout the body.\nTo become immortal or sage—what lament remains?\nTo achieve longevity is no difficult task.\nI recall the *Fire Dragon’s Direct Pointer* to the Reverted Elixir—\ncarefree and at ease,\nan immortal at leisure.\n\n**Second Watch**\nThe elixir’s decree arrives,\nriding dragons, mounting phoenixes beyond the spring clouds.\nThe Great Return in hand—all cherish it.\nNow one believes the golden elixir is fine medicine.\nMother and darling child reunited as one.\nSleep soundly,\nfeign foolishness.\nIn the realm of purity,\nuntouched by dust.\nFrom now on, settle old debts of enmity,\nbecome one who never ages.\nNurtured to bloom like apricot cheeks and peach blossoms.\n\n**Third Watch**\nAt the living midnight hour,\nthe immortal’s fair scene appears in the Flowery Pond.\nThe sacred tortoise drinks the essence of the Golden Crow,\nthe cinnabar phoenix bears the marrow of the Jade Hare.\n*Xuanming* wine—\ndrunk as if mad.\nThe host of yin vanishes,\nthe radiant yang season dawns.\nA branch of spring’s hue—golden blossoms just opened,\nthe fair one’s heart inclined, consenting,\nthe young lord delights in mutual joy.\nHaving met the return to origin and reversion to root,\nlongevity equals heaven’s span.\n\n**Fourth Watch**\nAs the watch deepens,\nlead stirs after *gui*—yin and yang part.\nJust as the first string of gold and water fills,\nlike orioles and flowers in the second month of spring.\nNo greed for wealth,\nno love of fame.\nDrink the nectar,\nlisten to the jade tones.\nThe azure sky merges with its root—clear waves pure,\nbefore the Hall of Empty Whiteness, tether the will-horse,\nbeneath the shadowless tree, lock the heart-ape.\nThree revolutions, nine transformations—the true person appears.\nHaving met the primordial Great Dao,\nlongevity surpasses heaven and earth.\n\n**Fifth Watch**\nHe comes at last—\nrank, wealth, and honor all cast aside.\nWith single mind, long for Penglai’s scenes,\nlet the Ten Continents and Three Isles be home.\nFree from desire’s fire,\nno entanglements.\nThis longevity\nlies within oneself.\nNurture gratitude for upbringing—do not falter,\nmeet others without speaking of hardship,\nfear no blade or soldier.\nThough beauties drape their curtains,\nnever again yearn for roadside willows or garden flowers.\n\n---\n\n**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**\n\n**First Watch**\nEnter the meditation chamber,\nbody and mind pure—no need to rush.\nHeart-ape and will-horse, do not let them stray.\nGuard the spirit terrace—white jade’s light,\nthe true person within, unoccupied.\nThe master sits atop Kunlun,\nthe Yellow Dame lures them into the bridal chamber.\nInfant boy and maiden girl paired as one,\nthe three families meet by the Winding River.\n\n**Second Watch**\nAscend the meditation mat,\ncontemplate parents before birth—\nthe original face ever revealed.\nGather the primordial to mend the later heaven,\nthe Three Passes revolve to the Mud Pill.\nSwallow often the divine water of the Flowery Pond,\nfire and water merge, warming the Lower Field.\nIn the crescent moon crucible, the supreme treasure simmers,\nthree revolutions, nine transformations—refine the elixir.\n\n**Third Watch**\nAs the first yang stirs,\n*kan* and *li* unite in marital bliss,\nno entanglements, ever pure.\nThe mud ox from the sea’s depths surges straight up,\na continuous stream of vitality pierces Kunlun.\nThe gold-water couple comes to join,\neternal white snow resides in the Yellow Court.\nHaving refined the golden elixir—an indestructible body,\nonly then does one fathom the mystery of the Pass.\n\n**Fourth Watch**\nSeek the ancestral wind,\nthe great intent from the West lies within.\nConstantly apply effort,\nthe bright moon overhead, crimson to the crown,\nilluminating one’s own master.\nNow one knows: in the crucible, lead meets mercury,\nwithin the exquisite pagoda, the true lineage appears.\nThe golden elixir refined—true emptiness,\nfor a thousand years, ten thousand ages, the body unmoved.\n\n**Fifth Watch**\nAlign with heaven’s mechanism,\nthe mystery of the One Aperture—few know it.\nWho recognizes the realm of life and death?\nAll depends on *wu* and *ji* to birth the infant,\ngolden light resplendent—Muni revealed.\nThe supreme treasure gathered in the Cinnabar Field,\nnurtured to spiritual perfection, equal to heaven.\nThe yang spirit’s wondrous form merges with the Great Void,\na single grain of millet embraces heaven and earth.\n\n---\n\n**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**\n\n**First Watch**\nLet all matters rest,\nrouse the spirit, sit at the bed’s head.\nMajestic and unmoving, the master guards,\nin the crescent moon crucible, the yellow sprout teases,\nwithin the Seven Treasures Grove, the true fluid flows.\nA single thrust of true yang pierces the Three Passes.\nIn an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,\nirrigating the Mud Pill, descending the Tower of Nine Stories.\n\n**Second Watch**\nThe heart must be steadfast,\nthe Three Corpses and gods—ever before one’s eyes.\n\n**Third Watch**\nThe Seven Passions and Six Desires come to temper,\nbefore one’s eyes, the Azure Blade is raised.\nRiding backward on the White Ox, ascending the mountain,\nthe yang spirit wages war against the yin soldiers.\nIn an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,\nin a flash, the Three Passes are breached.\n\n**Fourth Watch**\nHold fast to the practice,\ngather the primordial, the hare meets the hawk.\nWithin the boundless dark, true tidings arrive,\nlead and mercury unite in the crucible,\ndrawing from Kan to fill Li, entering the inner court,\nthe Yellow Dame directs with intent to guide.\nIn an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,\nin the sixth month, ice forms at the well’s bottom.\n\n**Fifth Watch**\nDiligence in effort,\nthe Wisdom Lamp must be held high.\nOnly then can tiger and dragon be subdued,\nZǐyáng’s dual cultivation of nature and life.\nScattered, they become heroes; gathered, they take form.\nThe Nine Returns and Seven Reversions—the true person recognizes.\nIn an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,\nthe yin tally retreats, the yang spirit refined.\n\n**Final Watch**\nDo not slacken,\ndrive the White Ox up the mountain.\nThe infant emerges, the luminous pearl appears,\na single grain of golden elixir like a pearl’s gleam,\ndrawn in and released at will, circling endlessly.\nThe corpse-thieves are locked in the Hall of the Empty King.\nIn an instant, water and fire achieve harmony.\nA hundred days’ work transforms the old into a youth’s visage.\n\n---\n\n**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**\n\nWithin stillness, observe the face and behold the signs,\nsearching for the root of the Dao’s apertures.\nIn

profit drift as they may,\nlet beloved children and charming wives be.\nToil of form is not worth returning to the mountains—\nhow could I bear to race all day?\nHow could I bear to scheme endlessly?\nCultivation must set a soaring resolve,\nto be a bold and generous man,\nshattering the mechanism of life and death,\nfree from vexation, sorrow, or care.\n\nI lament leaving home—how secluded it is,\ncutting off deluded thoughts and worries.\nHow can life be without dust or grime?\nHow could I seek profit or covet gain?\nHow could I idle and give up?\nResolutely not falling into impermanence’s grasp,\nI vow to seek a teacher,\nvowing to truly cultivate.\nNaturally, one day the elixir will be perfected,\nwhether I ride a crane or sail a boat,\nwhether I stroll leisurely,\nwho has fathomed the wondrous mystery of the true Dao?\n\nI lament leaving home—how profound it is,\nlearning to borrow the false to refine the true.\nIn walking, standing, sitting, lying, stabilize the true heart,\nloving to nurture qi and uplift spirit,\ndelighting in wood descending and metal ascending.\nThe numinous light appears, round as a mirror,\nin an instant, every aperture becomes spiritually attuned.\nThe Yellow River’s waters turn Mount Kunlun,\nnaturally recognizing the true mystery of transformation.\n\nI lament leaving home—how abstruse it is,\nseeing through seated meditation and Chan inquiry.\nThe master appears—what is this thing?\nIn the mystery, principle is wordlessly silent,\nin movement and stillness, adding mercury and drawing lead.\nLike a fool, like a drunk, the spirit never tires,\nwhen advancing the fire, civil and martial contend,\nwhen nurturing, after midnight and before noon,\nwater and fire conjoin in the same refining.\n\nI lament leaving home—how refined it is,\npreparing as a fierce general and mighty soldier.\n\nGuard against the Six Thieves as they haul and plunder,\nlet them ride mists and soar through clouds,\nlet them be seasoned in battle and skilled in strife—\nall is overcome by wondrous use.\nRaise the eye of wisdom, ten thousand riders charge as one,\nlift the sword of wisdom, severing demonic essence.\nThe Three Corpses yield, the Demon King submits,\nrevealing a heart of red loyalty and true devotion.\nNaturally, the land is enriched and the people pacified,\none battle won, all is at peace.\n\nI lament leaving home—how lofty it is,\nlearning some carefree wandering, at ease in fortune and misfortune.\nThrough the mysterious and wondrous,\na single meal—how much can one eat?\nThree cups of wine, and the face blooms like a peach of immortality,\nlaughing through the streets of flowers and willows.\nA small gourd always hangs at the waist,\na few packets of myriad-spirit elixir carried along,\neverywhere offering convenience to others,\nwhen fate aligns, fine wine and delicacies,\nin simplicity, drinking water from a gourd and eating from a bamboo bowl.\nWealth and poverty, success and failure—all shaped by heaven,\nlet them wear purple robes,\nlet them ride swift horses and don sable caps.\nIn the blink of an eye, impermanence arrives.\nThe Three Powers’ qi drifts ethereal and faint,\na household wails and cries—\nwhat care is given to filial sons or worthy grandsons?\nIn the end, cultivating the Dao is supreme,\nprolonging years, reducing illness, and dispelling calamity.\nWithout worry, without care, without vexation,\nawaiting the hour to ascend the clouds,\njoining the Eight Immortals to cross the Immortal Bridge,\nonly then is the wondrousness of the mystery revealed.\n\nI lament leaving home—how true it is,\nthe source of the heart must be cleansed and purified.\nOnly then is the principle within the mystery clearly seen.\nWho inquires into cultivating truth and nurturing nature?\nI have traversed rugged mountains and towering peaks,\nwandered through prefectures, counties, and cities,\nmingling with the bustle of markets and the radiance of the world.\nThere are those who avoid meat and abstain from lust,\nthose who embrace forbearance, endure insults, and keep wealth and principle distinct,\nin the lands of the southwest, they gather friends with respect.\nOnce, I too was drunk on principle, as if in a stupor,\nbut with sober eyes, I see the four seas of mortals,\nthe red dust churning, golden blossoms tender.\nWho in the world truly recognizes the moon at the edge of the sky?\nWhich matter in the world is clearly discerned?\nYet each clings to the aspiration of cultivating immortality.\nThe fifty-two verses of the mystery’s words,\nplainly and clearly spoken to you.\nSeek a bright teacher, visit the lofty,\nwith diligence, one may receive the gift of longevity.\n\n**The Moon at the Edge of the Sky**\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light bright,\nilluminating the world like an overturned basin—\nhow many enmities lie beneath that overturned basin?\nThrough kalpas of cultivation, one gains a human form,\nlosing it, ten thousand kalpas may not retrieve it,\nhard to retrieve is the true nature of the Eight Treasures.\nClinging to wife and children, like sheep among wolves,\nboasting of wealth and power, bullying the poor.\nBullying the poor will meet heavenly retribution.\nBetter to leap from the red dust,\nseek a bright teacher, and early embark on cultivation,\nthen one will naturally have a share among the immortals.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light dim,\nwho would cease their craving for glory and splendor?\nWithout ceasing, how can the conditions for immortality converge?\nI sigh for the world’s people, moored to a lone boat,\nlike bubbles floating on water,\nonce scattered, hard to reunite.\nBetter to turn back early,\nseek a bright teacher, and ride backward on the blue ox,\naccumulating merit and deeds until the elixir is formed.\nWhen guarding the will, wander the four seas,\nwhen achieving the aim, step onto Penglai,\nthen one’s name is recorded in the golden memorials.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light cold,\nto become an immortal is not difficult,\nnot difficult—if one can slay the Three Corpses.\nThe alms-bowl for subduing dragons is passed down orally,\nthe vessel for taming tigers holds ineffable secrets,\nineffable secrets must not be revealed to the unworthy.\nGreat spiritual power—planting lotuses in fire,\nthe master craftsman’s hand—rowing against the current,\nrowing against the current, do not falter.\nThe master steers the sails steady,\namidst the surging waves, gathering true lead,\nonly then can one ascend the Hall of Numinous Dawn,\nharvesting the sprouts of the medicine.\nWithin the Silver River, the tide rises,\nonly then is the wondrousness of the mystery revealed.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light high,\nan immortal crosses the Magpie Bridge,\nthe path of the Magpie Bridge is perilous, hard to reach.\nIn the Yellow Court, the Weaving Maid beckons,\nthe Cowherd and the Weaving Maid share laughter.\nMay heaven grant a Yellow Matron,\na fine affinity in the realm of the indistinct,\nwhen merit is complete and deeds fulfilled, the celestial decree arrives.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light solitary,\nthe cultivator, a true man,\nonly the great in talent walk the path of cultivation.\nImmortal Zhang once paid homage to Ancestor Lü,\nthe Dragon Girl offered a precious pearl,\nthe pearl summoned the protection of Chang’e.\nFrom the Mud Pill Palace, nectar descended,\nlike pearl-orange wine, refined into ghee,\nghee that tastes like sweet dew upon the lips.\nAdvancing the yang fire, the infant retreats the yin tally,\nentering the cinnabar field, firmly sealed,\nonly then is the path to heaven opened.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light drifting,\nan immortal plays a jade flute,\nthe jade flute’s notes open the heavenly apertures.\nHeaven and earth bow in reverence, unmoving and unshaken,\ninverting and employing skill with lofty art,\nwith lofty art, the wondrousness of the mystery is revealed.\nWhite snow flies into the ninth heaven,\nyellow sprouts grow into numinous shoots,\nwho knows the subtleties of the primordial!\nThe rolling pearl is hard to depict, hard to describe,\nthe hall of Mañjuśrī is tightly secured,\nonly then can one repay the teacher’s kindness.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light low,\nthe eighteen disciples play around Mañjuśrī,\nMañjuśrī enters the land of immortality.\nThe intent from the West is as if drunk, as if mad,\nobserving self and others in purity and non-action,\nfrom non-action, wondrous use arises.\nLead merges with mercury, life spans equal the heavens,\nwater and fire unite, forever secure,\nthe Three Corpses shrink their heads, the Demon King flees.\nThe wine of longevity, no cup needed,\nsweet as honey, self-administered in minute doses,\ndrunk, one attends the Peach Assembly.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light full,\nbeneath the ancient pine tree, the true mystery is realized,\nthe true mystery is seen only by oneself.\nSimurghs and phoenixes soar on high mountains,\nparrots sing, guarding the Mud Pill Palace,\nin the Mud Pill Palace, the infant’s face is seen.\nHolding the moon’s essence, neither ahead nor behind,\nembracing the sun in slumber, without earth or heaven,\nwithout heaven, one transforms into the Palace of Exquisite Jade.\n\nMay Heaven bestow a wisp of pure smoke,\nbearing millet grains aloft to the clouds,\nonly then shall one ascend to the Hall of Numinous Dawn.\n\nThe moon at the edge of the sky,\nits light formless,\nwithout appearance or shape, hard to depict,\ndepictions hard to enter the register of cultivation.\nNameless, yet heeding the call,\nformless, who discerns near and far?\nIn subtle wondrous use, nothing is revealed.\n\nWhen thought is absent, what need for effort?\nWhere conception ceases, the original substance is thus,\nonly thus is the path of one’s birth mother.\nIn the formless realm lies a true path,\nunobstructed, there is an immortal capital,\nonly then does one tread upon rosy clouds.\n\n*Twelve Songs of the Sweeping Light*\n\nSweep with light, illuminate the true,\nclap, clap—one’s breast brims with spring.\nJade is not treasure, pearls are not precious,\nthe road to Mount Bei Mang does not follow one’s

      "translated_text": "**Mysterious Essentials: Two Imitations of the Ancient**\n\n**Primordial Qi of the Origin**\nVague and dim, the primordial ancestral qi,\nSimple and turbid, obscure and indistinct.\nIt held the formless within, the first chaos unnamed.\nWhen the undifferentiated split, the Great One breathed forth its sprout.\nThe Two Modes joined in virtue, sun and moon waxed and waned.\nHeaven intermingled with Earth’s transformations, Earth sought Heaven’s completion.\nDifferent names yet one source, a single root shared.\nWithin and without, void and solid, firm and yielding balanced.\nYin and yang divided by principle, change shaped all forms.\nTrue essence, true qi—elusive, profound, and obscure.\nKan and Li inverted, the Five Phases set in motion.\nWhen the hexagram *Jiji* arises, gods are born;\nwhen *Weiji* comes, death draws near.\nThe Dao of immortality is guarded with care,\nwhile the ghostly path inclines toward perversion.\nThose who emulate Heaven’s Way swiftly shun the gates of ghosts.\nBy seeking Heaven through immortality, the eminent Dao endures.\nThe great Dao of Heaven and Earth embraces harmony and holds the center.\nThe mysterious ancestor, the wondrous origin—\nprofound and subtle, it pierces the primordial chaos.\nThe bellows and furnace, the Vermilion Bird scorching the sky,\nthe Metal Direction’s moon appears, the southwest gains its companion.\nLaughing, they pour the dark wine, feasting within the Yellow Center.\nTwo eights achieve perfection, crow and hare merge as one.\nThe divine light is silent, the Yellow Chamber’s venerable elder.\nThe Wind of Xun stirs, the cauldron brims with rosy clouds.\nWater and fire advance and retreat, dawn as *Zhun*, dusk as *Meng*.\nMidnight and noon in motion, dawn and dusk without effect.\nWhen the tenth month’s count is complete,\nthe hexagrams’ symbols reverse and end.\nThe work of destiny is fulfilled, pure yang qi surges.\nThe divine mechanism’s wondrous use—Dao’s methods are boundless.\n\n---\n\n**Ladder to Heaven**\nA wanderer of the Great Origin, drifting like tumbleweed,\nhis whiskers bristling like halberds.\nA single tune ascends the ladder to Heaven,\nworthy of a flying staff through the void.\nRecalling the start of my Dao-seeking,\nmy heart remained unshaken as stone.\nI abandoned office to roam seas and mountains,\ntoiling in search of the elixir’s secrets.\nI bid farewell to my parents’ graves,\nunable to linger in my homeland.\nI parted from my middle-aged wife,\nleaving as the sky began to pale.\nI left my young children,\nturning away from the burning house.\nWhat others find hard to complete,\nthis traveler has already done.\nWhat others find hard to sever,\nthis traveler has already cut.\nTo witness the fruit of eternal life,\nI soared aloft on a crane’s back.\nCultivating after Heaven’s pattern, steadfast,\nmy two feet outpaced the toil.\nThe passing years urged my heart,\ntime fleeting as a galloping colt.\nI raised my gaze to Zhongnan Mountain,\nsighing thrice to the heavens.\nHeaven sent the Fire Dragon Master,\nwhose mysterious teachings matched one by one.\nKnowing my inner elixir was complete,\nhe did not speak of foundational work.\nHe bestowed upon me the outer elixir’s skill,\npiteously instructing me with earnest care.\nRefining the self, I forgot worldly attachments,\ngathering the medicine according to the seasons.\nThe prior Heaven has no weight,\nthe fire times no fixed measures.\nOnly distinguish old from young,\nmerely discern civil from martial.\nSeek purely with true intent,\nthe knife and scale defy clear description.\nFor ten months, embrace the primordial embryo;\nfor nine years, face the wall in meditation.\nExchange the cauldron to beget a new generation,\nmount the dragon to rise with thunder.\nThough Heaven and Earth may perish in time,\nthe immortal elder’s life knows no end!\n\n---\n\n**The Master’s Oral Transmission**\nThe sagely master’s oral transmission,\na famed formula bequeathed through ages.\nPassed to the people of the world,\nhow many can truly know it?\nA torn robe is mended with cloth,\na withered tree nurtured with soil.\nWhen a person is worn, what can restore them?\nThe mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.\nTake the elixir from within Kan,\na golden flower’s single dewdrop.\nAuspicious clouds open at Heaven’s edge,\npropitious light fills the grave’s foundation.\nReturn to the self, silent and dim,\nas if drunk, as if mad.\nThe great elixir, like a grain of millet,\ncasts off its husk to abide in non-action.\nRoaming freely through Heaven and Earth’s expanse,\nthe myriad images a pearl in the palm.\nIf one can ingest this medicine,\nlife spans the length of Heaven and Earth.\nIf it does not prolong life,\nmy words are all falsehood.\n\n---\n\n**Reply to Emperor Yongle**\nHeaven’s mechanism is not lightly revealed,\nlest the present age lack vigor.\nThrough a thousand trials and ten thousand hardships, toil and struggle.\nNow I transmit it to the pulse of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Emperor seeks from me the golden elixir,\nthe ancestral master left behind the formula for eternal life.\nWhat is the formula for eternal life?\nWhen Dao is full and virtue abundant, it is the true plan.\nCurb desires, settle the mind, calm the spirit’s cares—\nimmortals possess no other arts!\nBelow this, another five-character verse:\n*\"The golden elixir weighs one catty,\nclose your eyes and silently preserve the spirit.\nIt is found within the home,\nwhy labor to seek it outside?\nRefine the Li maiden’s mercury,\nconsume the Kan man’s essence.\nThe golden elixir and fire times—\neach word is the primordial sound.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Dao’s Sentiment**\nThe Dao’s sentiment is no ordinary feeling,\nonce you recognize Heaven’s mechanism, do not treat it lightly.\nFirst, set aside worldly attachments entirely,\nthen delve deeply into the principles.\nBefore refining the returning elixir, refine your nature;\nbefore cultivating the great medicine, cultivate your heart.\nWhen the heart is cultivated, the elixir’s trust arrives;\nwhen nature is purified, the medicinal materials grow.\nThe medicinal materials grow—apply effort diligently,\nthunder rumbles faintly, shaking the empty sky.\nWhere lightning flashes, seek the true seed;\nwhen the wind’s signal comes, find the root origin.\nRosy clouds in ten thousand strands envelop the golden cauldron,\npurple clouds a thousand fathoms shroud Heaven’s gate.\nIf you reach this point, do not be startled or afraid—\nsteadily guard the cavern’s gate with your primordial spirit.\nLike a cat seizing a mouse, a hare meeting a hawk,\nhurry and exert yourself, redoubling your effort.\nThe myriad forms and images are not of the same kind—\na single crimson light is the utmost truth.\nThis crimson light is the mind’s intent,\nwithin it, like dust in a bright window.\nSuspended is the prior Heaven’s medicine,\ndistant as a grape, near as gold.\nAt this point, rely entirely on caution—\nthe slightest thought arising loses the celestial truth.\nWait for that single point to submit of itself,\ntransforming within the body into the four seasons’ spring.\nA wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance,\neach rain’s passing brings renewal.\nAll day, languid as a drunkard,\nidly awaiting the cavern’s embrace.\nThe body’s yin essence is entirely stripped away,\ntransmuted into a lump of pure yang.\nAt this moment, breath ceases as in a minor death,\nforged into a single whole, the complete truth.\nHere, the work is accomplished and complete—\nthen return to the mortal world to accumulate merit.\nWhen merit is fulfilled and work complete, Heaven’s decree arrives,\nthe yang spirit emerges, revealing the true numen.\nThese words must not be spoken to the unworthy—\ndo not lightly discuss them with those who do not understand.",

work—\nturning the Celestial Gate demands fierce vigor.\nYin arises at noon within the yang of Kan,\nwhile at Mao and You, proceed with measured calm.\nThe Dipper’s handle turns the wheel toward the Purple Palace,\nlaughing to welcome the young guest, Master Huang.\n\nIn the Palace of the Yellow Dame, meet the Maiden of Mystery—\nthe Maiden and the Infant pair of their own accord.\nTo lay the foundation, refine the self;\nrefine it to purity, then gather with clarity.\nMy obscure master taught me this segment of practice:\nfirst open the nine orifices by unsealing the gates.\nThe nine orifices originate at the Weilu point—\nbegin at the soles’ bubbling springs, surging upward.\nFrom the bubbling springs, rise gradually to the knees;\nbelow the knees, the work demands exertion.\nThe Buddhists call this \"reed sprouts,\"\nor liken it to insects creeping, thorns piercing.\nPass the knees slowly to reach the Weilu,\nwhere a hard object seems to resist.\nOnly then proceed with all higher practices—\nthree stages of work, each with its oral formula.\nOnce the three passes converge in one opening,\nturn it upward to the Mud Pill Palace.\nPierce the Golden Lock Gate, descend the Magpie Bridge—\nthe Twelve-Storied Tower, how wondrous indeed!\nThe Twelve-Storied Tower is the Crimson Palace,\nand within the Crimson Palace lies the Yellow Court.\nThe Yellow Court’s chamber must be refined;\nits essence is the single luminous point at its center.\nNever mistake obscurity for secrecy—\nthe Yellow Court is the true Mysterious Pass.\nIf you fail to recognize the Mysterious Pass in its true place,\nwhere can true lead arrive and settle?\n\nHave you not seen the *Awakening to Reality* poem?\n\"Only by the Mysterious Female can the root be established.\"\nWhen true essence returns, the golden void remains—\na single luminous pearl never departs.\nHave you not read the *Triple Concordance*?\n\"It resembles Penglai, no falsehood in the comparison.\"\nClosing below is called the supreme closure of the existent;\nthe two apertures’ method requires qi’s mutual dependence.\nFrom now on, when discoursing on the Dao or expounding on the profound,\nall else is vain without this.\n\nOnce the gates are opened and merit is accumulated,\nforging the sword demands understanding the true message.\nEven Moye was wrought from iron—\nhow much more is my sword inherently straight!\nHeaven is the furnace, earth the forge;\ngold and water must balance—never act recklessly.\nAt Zi and Wu, practice to temper it,\nable to be hard or soft, to take or discard.\nWhen the sword is complete, gather true lead—\ngather the primordial chaos before it divides.\nIf you receive only postnatal qi,\nyou merely extend his lifespan.\n\nAt the second watch of the seventh day, the true mechanism appears—\nseek it within the divine land of the Red Continent.\nIf you obtain both method and resource,\nthen carefully ponder and distinguish.\nPink clouds, the hue of a pheasant’s plumage,\nlips like cinnabar, skin as snow.\nWise and intelligent, nature gentle and kind,\neyes like lacquered pearls, hair pure black.\nQi clear, gaze steady, steps measured—\nonly then calculate the months and years within.\nFive thousand four hundred births yield the Yellow Path,\ndim and distant, born of vagueness.\nGather in accord with the time, determining rise and fall—\nnot a hair’s breadth may be transgressed.\nAt this juncture, know the crescent moon’s third day;\nthe wonder lies in the west’s Geng and Xin, white.\nThe sword of wisdom sharp, the inner heart sincere,\nstrike the bamboo to resonate, then pluck the zither.\nThe Heavenly Ladder must be used—never omitted!\nWho can fathom such profound and secret mechanisms?\nDo not recklessly fish the giant turtle from the sea’s depths,\nlest you startle it away, never to return.\n\nGuard the furnace without damage, distinguish the timing with care—\ngathering postnatal qi only extends the years.\nOne double-hour divides into six watches;\nthe elixir forms in just two watches.\nThe remaining four watches hold divine work—\nthe wonder lies in heart-transmission, hard to divulge.\n\nWhen true lead arrives, ignite the spiritual fire—\nfrom west to east, first seek me.\nMove my true mercury, a single red point,\nto meet and merge into one pearl.\nPass the three passes, ascend to the Mud Pill Palace,\ndescend the Twelve-Storied Tower, vast and cold.\nNeither foolish nor wise,\nneither sober nor drunk.\nIf not for expending spirit throughout the body,\nhow could husband and wife unite as a pair?\n\nOnce the elixir is settled, the heart toils at dusk and dawn—\nthe *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams respond at dawn and dusk.\nKnow that bathing occurs within them—\nat Mao and You, do not advance.\nGuard the city walls, cease the martial work,\nand the crucible fills with numinous cinnabar, crimson.\nAfter ten months, the work is complete—\nthe vessel, the elixir chamber, all emptied.\nEnter the deep mountains, embrace the One,\nall things voided, effortless.\nCold, heat, hunger, and toil cannot assail you;\nfor nine majestic years, face the wall.\nFrom the Northern Sea at dawn to Yingzhou at dusk,\nsuddenly, when merit and practice are complete,\nthe Three Officials of the Water Palace tally your years—\na sealed elixir missive descends from the Jade Heaven,\ngreen luan and white cranes dance, their wings flapping.\nOnly when enlightenment is thorough and investiture complete\nwill you forever become an ageless immortal.\n\n**Song of the True Bellows**\nDo not say the Great Dao acts through non-action—\nwhy then fiddle with the bellows in the chamber?\nWhen desire stirs, not a moment’s rest,\npurple qi and red light flicker wildly.\nThe Azure Dragon rejoices, the White Tiger despises—\nthe Azure Dragon coils around the tortoise’s shell.\nTwo streams of true qi pierce the Celestial Palace,\ndecisively ascending to the Three Clarities’ Pavilion.\nWithin the pavilion, a jade pool is clearly seen,\nholding the medicine of ageless life.\nGather it in due time and consume it—\nthen enjoy the bliss of Penglai.\n\n**Song of the Mysterious Pass**\nThe Mysterious Pass, a single aperture, holds the true formula—\nheaven and earth split open, Penglai’s vastness revealed.\nIn the Yellow Court dwells an original elder,\nholding the zither, awaiting the moon at the sky’s edge.\nThe second water is clear, the third water turbid—\nwhen the golden flower blooms, the Dui trigram’s head is incomplete.\nOn Mount Emei, purple mist flies,\nthe mist transforms, melting the red furnace’s snow.\nThe dragon’s chant compels, the tiger’s roar presses—\nthe numinous tortoise drinks the Golden Crow’s blood.\nRiding the dragon, sword at the waist, drunk and returning home,\nturn the three passes to face the Northern Palace.\n\n**Oral Formula for Refining Lead**\nThe Supreme Dao, proclaimed again and again,\nreveals the distinction between the primordial and the postnatal.\nIt speaks only of lead born after Gui,\nnot of yang arising before Gui.\nRein in the horse of the mind, lock the monkey of the heart;\nwithout stray thoughts, the intent must be single.\nSever greed and anger, extinguishing the three poisons;\neradicate love and desire, driving away the five thieves.\nThe Flowery Pond’s water, the Upper Valley’s spring—\nthe ancients used these to moisten the three fields.",

this path are but madness.\n\nI have revealed all the celestial mechanisms—\nthe Returned Elixir is indeed the immortal’s formula.\nGenerations of immortals attain this,\ntranscending the mortal world to ascend to heaven.\n\nI exhort later Dao seekers:\nheed not the false teachers’ deceptive words.\nIf you obtain the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir,\nyou will extend years, abide in the world, live boundlessly.\n\nBy this cultivation, you tread the path of eternal life,\nrepaying your master’s grace, giving thanks to heaven.\nHold fast to this secret,\nmake it your compassionate vessel.\nWhen merit is complete and work perfected,\nyou move the Jade Emperor’s heart.\n\nWho crafted the Golden Liquid that breaks delusion?\nFrom ancient times, it has flowed forth from Yuanhua Zhang.\n\n---\n\n**Two Songs of the Dragon-Tiger Returned Elixir, Pointing the Path to Delusion**\n\nThough you inquire everywhere for the immortal’s ladder,\nonly at the first stirring of yang does it become wondrous.\nWater submerges Kunlun, overturning the azure sea;\nthe tiger’s roar on the cliff is the ancestral foundation.\n\nThis directly points to the carefree shortcut—\na bright moon illuminates Mount Sumeru.\nThe tiger in water, the dragon in fire,\nwithin the Eight Trigrams and Five Phases, they manifest radiance.\n\nSeize the dragon—purple mist arises;\nsubdue the tiger—golden floral dew appears.\nHow do these two images establish the root of the Dao?\nOnly because they have long borrowed the path of Caoxi.\n\nMale pairs with female, yin pairs with yang,\ntheir union clearly a battle.\nWu-ji soil forms the Yellow Chamber—\nwhen spirit and qi are pure, it is the King of Medicines.\n\nRefine the grain of Purple Gold Elixir,\nand you ride the crane, mount the phoenix, to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.\nThe tiger hides in the azure sea, slumbering with the child;\nthe dragon circles the Fusang tree in the sun’s light.\n\nWait until the yang of spring stirs,\nthe tiger emits golden light, the dragon spits saliva.\nWith a treasured sword at your waist, gather the dragon’s mist;\nwhen the tiger sees the dragon return, they submerge together.\n\nThe two creatures follow one another to Wu-ji,\nin a crucible of true fire, slowly simmered.\nFrom midnight to the year’s end, the firing times are strict;\nat dawn and dusk, do not neglect the work.\n\nSwallow the ancestral qi, consume the jade nectar—\nwho understands true emptiness within form?\nRefinement lies solely in the place of one’s birth;\nthe Ten Kings of Hell share this method.\n\nHasten to awaken, do not be foolishly greedy—\ndo not call the old man’s words heresy.\nThough you expound the Three Treasuries’ Dharma,\nwithout awakening to non-arising, it is all in vain.\n\nBreak open this iron steamed bun,\nand you will roam carefree for billions of years.\n\n---\n\n**Three-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of the Soul’s Birth, Three Returns to One**\n\nMonth by month,\nall are the true essence and blood within the young lotus.\nNo need to set up the furnace or establish the crucible—\nonly use non-action to draw it through.\n\nNor wait for the qi of the two crescents;\nwait only for the star palace between the brows.\nNor wait for eight taels or half a catty as the living child;\nwait only for the exact moment of five thousand four hundred.\n\nNo need for spirit to commune across bodily separation—\nonly use the two ○ of upper exhalation and lower inhalation.\nFirst, the whole body warms;\nsecond, the fontanel opens;\nthird, the celestial eye opens—\nthen you see the great thousandfold world.\nAt this point of efficacy, it is truly\nthe birth of the embryo, the birth of the fetus, the birth of the soul.\n\nInstruct the immortal-seeking disciples:\nyou must ride the crane amidst the clouds,\nnever be buried in the sands and dust.\n\n---\n\n**Four-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of the Po’s Birth, Four Returns to Two**\n\nThe Venerable Ancestor is named the Demon-Quelling Protector of the Dao,\npermeating the seven po, mastering them at you.\nWithin you lies true gold—\ngold can preserve eternal life.\nThe imperial true po, the life’s origin,\nfrom this, the wondrous primordial arises.\n\nOn the wedding night in the bridal chamber,\nfacing circumstances, forget passion.\n*Tali kou ye, kou mo li ye,\njin zha mu zha kou ta nan kou ye, kou yan,\nsi wo ye, si wo ye,\nnamo prajñā-pāramitā ye.*\n\n---\n\n**Seven-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of Opening the Heart and Seven Orifices, Seven Returns to Five**\n\nThe Dao Lord sits in the Grand Tenuity,\ndescending as the Great Heavenly Honored One.\nHe bestows these true Dharma words,\nguiding people to the Jade Purity.\n\nA single-character secret,\nseven months as its form.\nTwo on the left, three on the right, called five—\nthe Supreme Ultimate is naturally endowed with five numina.\n\nOnly when the five numina attain it do the seven orifices open;\nyou must move the celestial eye to come here.\nThose who truly cultivate the Dao\npierce the mechanism to ascend the jeweled terrace.\n\n---\n\n**Ten-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of Firmness of Form and Spirit, Ten Returns**\n\nThe Immortal Maiden of Jade Flute plays her jade flute,\neach note blowing into the primordial pass—\nthis pass is called the root of heaven and earth.\nWhen the primordial is sufficient, a hundred scenes naturally give birth to spirit;\nthe eight scenes give birth to the twenty-four heavens,\nand the nine orifices naturally open to the numinous.\n\nThe sacred embryo originally borrows a single true spark;\nthe Queen Mother’s Jasper Pool brims with golden liquid,\nthe lotus heart.\nHeart after heart unites with the yellow sprout,\nfragrance arises within, brocading heaven and earth.\n\nSeizing the true fragrance’s wondrous mist,\nit preserves me for kalpas, ever abiding.\nEver since the Pure Yang Patriarch revealed this,\ngenerations of the worthy have applied their minds.\n\nOn Penglai Isle, your name shall remain;\nat the Yingzhou Assembly, you shall meet.\nYou must emulate Master Xu,\nwho in broad daylight raised his dwelling and ascended.\n\nThree years of earnest exhortation today—\nmay all people possess longevity,\nyang uniting with the primordial root.\n\n---\n\n**Song of Securing the Leak**\n\nSpeak of the mysterious, expound the mysterious—\nmove the spirit, turn the nine orifices,\nknock down the three passes and eight gates.\nClose the Grotto Chamber, refine the elixir furnace—\ndo not let the six thieves cause clamor.\n\nThe master laughs heartily,\nguarding the Yellow Court.\nAh!\nThe infant comes, the crone and

Cauldron and Parting the Embryo**\n\nReinstalling the furnace and cauldron, establishing kun and qian,\nwith skillful hands, the elixir is moved into the upper field.\nVirtue and power ascend—spirit

nurture grandchildren, grandchildren nurture sons,\nold man and old woman—all ascend as immortals.\n\n**Transforming and Communing with the Numinous**\n\nNurturing the mysterious grandson until he gradually matures,\na strong lineage surpasses its ancestors in wise planning.\nLast night beneath the lamp, a fine match was made,\ntoday in the hall, a brilliant scion is born.\nEach child stands like a jade tree,\ntheir immortal descendants cluster like golden stalks.\nA company surpassing linked jade disks,\ntax-free fertile fields—self-cultivated alone.\n\n**Ninefold Spiritual Transformation**\n\nNinefold cinnabar elixir—years deepen,\nnurturing śarīra that gods and ghosts revere.\nA furnace of white snow, pure as jade,\na cauldron of yellow sprouts, finer than gold.\nOnce seen, phoenixes dance with simurghs,\nnow behold tigers roaring and dragons chanting.\nThe five metals and eight minerals all become treasures,\nrefining the celestial origin to ascend with one’s dwelling.\n\n**Cultivating the Celestial Origin**\n\nWho knows the celestial origin’s elixir grade?\nBorn from non-being—rare in the world.\nHeaven and earth serve as the furnace—true creation,\nyin and yang as the medicine—subtle and profound.\nThe chicken that eats transforms into a crane, soaring through blue clouds,\nthe dog that feeds becomes a dragon, flying in broad daylight.\nOnly here is the ultimate subtlety attained,\npermitting you to join hands and return together.\n\n**Carefree and Unfettered**\n\nThe Daoist long since dissolved ears and eyes,\ncarefree and unconstrained, free from bonds.\nAt dawn, rising with the sun at Fusang,\nat dusk, lodging at Kunlun’s cloud feet.\nHow many years since the green ox crossed the pass?\nThis Dao lies clearly before your eyes.\nLast night, after three refrains of the jade zither,\nthe wind chilled the sky, the moon shone bright.\n\n**Attaining the Dao and Delivering Others**\n\nTwin iron flutes blow through the dawn

Golden Elixir**\n\nGathering prior-heaven to refine the posterior-heaven,\nthe two qi circulate from a shared root.\nTo know the formed as originally formless,\none must recognize the first and last crescents.\nVast and indistinct—where heaven and earth divide,\ndim and obscure—before father and mother were born.\nConsuming it, chaos remains like a dream,\ntransforming into an infant with ten thousand years of life.\n\nThe moon itself has no light—it borrows the sun’s,\neach month from new to full, yin and yang are fixed.\nToad and crow unite in true essence,\nOxherd and Weaver Girl meet in the distant haze.\nNaturally, the soul responds to the sacred spirit,\nwhile heaven and earth endure.\nIf the adept grasps the mystery within,\ntheir name and fame hang high in the Purple Palace.\n\nSeven days of yang descend the magpie bridge,\nascending the bridge, the couple roams freely.\nReversing the sea’s waters to flow into the celestial valley,\ninverting the sail to navigate the Dipper’s frame.\nHands grasp heaven and earth, dividing creation,\ntimed by years and months, pacing the celestial circuit.\nSuch are the immortal’s arts—always thus,\nnot to contend with the vulgar in idle debate!\n\nThe bellows blow, aided by the xun wind,\ndrawing kun’s fire from the primordial flood.\nGently lifting it to Kunlun’s summit,\ngradually swallowing it into the earthen

difficult.\n\nDragon ascends, tiger descends—turning the river chariot,\nred fire seizes and refines the white sand.\nThe two qi congeal the embryo—lead naturally diminishes,\nthe three flowers gather at the crown—mercury returns and increases.\nOpening the furnace, stir it gently to form stalactites,\nraising the cauldron, know it as horse’s teeth.\nGrasp both substances—do not let them escape,\nreleasing them loses the golden flower’s beauty.\n\nGathering from kun’s earth where water and metal abound,\nplanting in qian’s domain, entering the river of love.\nYang fire and yin tally

open ten thousand apertures to face the heavens.\nThe work within the body I alone know—\nwho has glimpsed the celestial mechanism’s profound mystery?\nFirst, seek the Dragon and Tiger locked in battle,\nthen behold the Tortoise and Snake joyfully following in song.\nHeaven and earth inverted, observing *pi* and *tai*,\nfire talismans rise and cease in *xu* and *wei*.\nSouth Star and North Dipper mirror front and back,\nsun and moon, Crow and Toad, fly to and fro.\n\nThe great Dao of cultivation is the ancestor of heaven and earth,\ngathering yin and yang to forge the work of creation.\nTo subdue the celestial soul and birth the White Tiger,\none must capture the earthly spirit to produce the Azure Dragon.\nCirculate the supreme treasure to the central confluence,\ntransforming the yang spirit to ascend the upper palace.\nA single *qi* condenses into one grain of elixir—\nif one can swallow it, their countenance becomes youthful.\n\nA thousand side paths branch from the Dao,\nbut without knowing the fire’s timing, all is in vain.\nFirst delve into the wondrous principle to truly awaken,\nthen bow to an enlightened master to receive the oral transmission.\nTo unite the three families in harmony,\nrely solely on the steadfastness of the Dao-heart.\nMorning and evening, forge and temper the spirit’s brilliance,\ncondensing the true spirit to ascend the nine heavens.\n\nSeeking the true requires recognizing the Void’s aperture—\nthe work lies only where intention arrives.\nComing and going, reversing and following, refine yin and yang;\nrising and descending, *kan* and *li* invert.\nVaguely, indistinctly, the Supreme Ultimate arises,\ndimly, obscurely, the Infant’s omen appears.\nExiting the mysterious, entering the feminine, all is natural—\nas if forgotten, as if preserved, guarding the furnace and hearth.\n\nKnowing the prior to refine the Golden Elixir,\nif the fire cools or water dries, the work is incomplete.\nSupreme virtue, non-action, perfects the sage,\nwhile lesser efforts, with action, circulate the *zhou tian*.\nAt the stirring of the first yang, heaven and earth are revealed;\nwhen the two grades unite, Buddhas and immortals are born.\nPlanting flowers in the moon lasts but a fleeting moment,\nyet the Toad’s radiance emerges, illuminating the western river.\n\n**Jade Flower Poem**\nJade branches and trees belong to the immortals’ realm—\nwho in the mortal world has seen such a flower?\nIts pure essence untouched by common rain and dew,\nits lofty bearing ever veiled in ancient mist and rosy clouds.\nThough ages pass, it never ages,\npeerless in the world—let none boast idly.\nI would carry it back to heaven,\nplanning to borrow the Magpie Bridge from *Bowang*.\n\n**Five Seven-Character Quatrains**\nThe true heart, vast and boundless,\ngives rise to limitless immortals within.\nMortals cling to their petty forms—\nwho recognizes the single grain of mysterious pearl?\n\nThe Buddha’s seal points to emptiness as awakening,\nDanyang’s secret breaks open nothingness to reveal being.\nSeize the original, primal spark—\nthrough ten thousand ages, the body never decays.\n\nTracing the current straight to Penglai,\nscattering sweet springs to moisten the nine realms.\nFrom this, the cinnabar field is nourished,\nand yellow sprouts bloom everywhere at once.\n\nYears, months, days, and hours are but empty markers,\nhexagrams, lines, ounces, and taels are but fragments.\nIf you have grasped the ceaseless intent,\nthis is precisely the time of \"neither forgetting nor assisting.\"\n\nThe great medicine is but a single pill—\nseek its kindred pair to rejoice together.\nIf mortals ask for the secret of longevity,\nfirst seek the dual elixirs of yin and yang.\n\n**Ascending the High Terrace**\nThe wonders of the Golden Elixir’s creation are hard to express,\nwho can discern the subtle principles of the mysterious?\nFortunately, I met an enlightened master who pointed the way,\nprying open the sky within the water.\n\nFirst, he taught me to guard the mysterious pass,\ncross-legged, sitting to harmonize spirit, principle, and *qi*,\nbanishing thoughts, sealing the senses, lowering the lids.\nNext, he taught me to stir the *xun* wind,\ncirculating water and fire,\nguarding the true essence,\npreserving the original yang,\nturning the celestial pivot.\n\nThen I saw the Yellow River’s waters surging in reverse,\nflowing from *yongquan*,\nirrigating *weilu*,\nascending *jiaji* to reach *niwan*.\nPassing the Hall of Light and the Great Flower Pool,\nthe divine water gradually swelled,\ndescending the Tower of Nine Stories,\nentering the Crimson Palace,\nuntil it reached the cinnabar field.\nThis is the foundation-laying and self-refinement—\nhenceforth, one abides in the world to extend years.\n\nIf one further seeks the supreme path of ascension,\nthe master teaches to reset the furnace,\nreestablish the tripod,\ngathering the prior heaven to match the posterior.\nAt *zi* and *wu*, focus on the fire’s timing,\nat *mao* and *you*, bathe the Golden Elixir.\nFirst, he taught me to understand the mechanism of heaven and earth,\nthen to distinguish yin and yang.\nHeaven exists because of the Mother,\nwithout the Mother, there is no heaven—\nthis is the root of the great Dao.\nCount the *zhou tian* from the beginning,\ninvert *qian* and *kun* to set them right.\nDiligently refine the posterior heaven’s *yin*,\nseizing the prior heaven to become a sage or immortal.\n\nI have already bowed to an enlightened master,\nheart-to-heart transmission, mouth-to-mouth teaching.\nWhen laying the foundation, first clarify the bellows and furnace,\nwhen refining the self, use only true lead.\nThe fullness within *kan* and the emptiness within *li*—\n*li*’s void takes from *kan* to replenish.\nIn reversal, the immortal dragon swallows the tiger’s marrow;\nin sequence, the mortal tiger seizes the dragon’s saliva.\nWhat delights is the Wood Dragon concealing mercury,\nwhat is cherished is the Metal Tiger spitting lead.\nThe moon’s fullness depends on the oral formula,\nthe hour of *zi*’s wonder lies in heart transmission.\nGathering the prior heaven’s work relies entirely on *wu* and *ji*;\nseizing the posterior heaven’s brilliance begins with the Dragon and Tiger at the new moon.\nAzure Dragon and White Tiger battle,\nJade Hare and Golden Horse revolve as one.\nBeware only of lacking the wisdom sword within,\nfear only the rapids where the boat cannot be reined in.\nWait only for the Yellow Dame’s beckoning,\nawait only the Maiden’s lotus blossoming.\n\nThis matter is hard to speak of—\nwithin five thousand days, you must calculate,\nthirty *shi chen* secretly revolving.\nBefore *zi* and after *wu*, observe clearly:\nlead yang has not stirred,\n*gui* appears ahead,\ntrue lead and true yang follow behind.\nWhen the

      "translated_text": "First discern the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,\nthen match yin and yang in their pairing.\nBefore Heaven there was the Mother;\nwithout the Mother, there would be no Heaven—\nthis is the root-source of the Daoist teaching.\nCount the celestial cycles from the beginning,\ninvert qian and kun to set them aright.\nThe moon’s fullness lies in the oral formula,\nthe hour of zi’s mystery in heart-transmission.\nI raise my sword of edge-less sharpness—\nwhat I fear is the rushing rapids where boats stall,\nwhat I sense is the Yellow Dame’s beckoning,\nwhat I await is the Maiden’s unfolding lotus—\nthis matter is hard to speak of.\nFive thousand days, close-calculated with steadfast heart,\nthirty hours, silently revolving in the dark.\nI stand the Dragon’s Head upright,\nhe suspends the Moon’s Grotto in emptiness.\nDisplaying divine power, I plant lotuses in raging fire,\nwielding the craftsman’s hand, I pole a boat against the current.\nI do not envy lovely, delicate flowers,\nonly long for the sweet dew and sacred spring.\nAssault the Divine Continent, breach the Crimson County,\nseize the Golden Essence and lead it carefully,\nescort it into the Cinnabar Field.\nGuard against danger, dispel stray thoughts,\nbathe in spontaneity.\nAfter nine years facing the wall,\nI become an immortal beyond the world—\ndwelling in Penglai’s paradise.\n\n---\n\nIn quest of the Great Dao’s mystery,\nI wandered to the ends of the earth.\nCast aside fame, power, and profit,\nabandoned home, estate, and fields.\nThrough myriad hardships,\nrobes torn, shoes worn, I could barely face my master.\nI worried—lest sixty or seventy years of life be too brief,\nuntil entering Zhongnan, I received the Fire Dragon’s oral transmission.\nCommanded to leave the mountain, seek companions, and quest for lead,\nI visited renowned worthies—\nall proved cunning, miserly, and thieving of the Dao’s mystery.\nYet it was my destined karmic cause to emerge in this world,\nand fortunately, I met Shen Wansan, generous and true.\nAlas, his strength was insufficient to complete the work,\nso I had no choice but to tend the furnace and refine the elixir.\nAfter nine revolutions, I went to the Pleasure Garden to gather herbs and enact talismans,\nthen spent five years on Mount Wudang.\nFacing the wall, I harmonized spirit for another nine years,\nwhen suddenly I heard the imperial summons.\nI wished to avoid the emperor’s presence,\nbut feared for Minister Hu’s life.\nRiding clouds, I ascended to the Court of the Rising Sun,\nwhere the sovereign’s dragon countenance lit with joy.\nI longed to transmit the teaching mouth-to-mouth,\nbut feared violating the Jade Emperor’s decree—\nso I mounted the phoenix and rode the simurgh to the Ninth Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on Golden Flowers**\n\nGolden flowers, fresh and bright,\nwithout wealth, cultivation is hard.\nI dare not speak of it to others,\neach must calculate for themselves.\nSeeking external protectors, I found no worthy sages,\nso I held fast to the celestial mechanism for years.\nTesting and verifying, wondrous and profound,\nrelying on the sword of wisdom, I gathered the primordial.\nOnly now do I know—\nthe Dao lies before me,\nand I truly believe the Golden Elixir has an orthodox transmission.\nI play the flute without holes,\nstrum the stringless zither.\nI delight in yellow sprouts and white snow,\ncherish the first scripture and red lead.\nI drink the wine of life-extension,\nconsume the soul-returning divine pill.\nI engage in the work within the flask,\nplay with the golden toad at the sea’s bottom.\nSeizing sun and moon, I refine them in the furnace,\nwresting qian and kun, I seethe them in the crucible.\nThis is my true method of cultivation,\nthe skill of one who has left the household.\nI regret that in the past,\nlacking money, I pleaded with Heaven day and night—\npitiful indeed!\nBut now, fortune has turned,\nand I await only the completion of merit and perfection of work,\nto cast off all and become a carefree immortal beyond the world.\n\nGolden flowers, jade buds—fresh and bright,\nhard for the world to distinguish.\nFor immortality, one must subdue qi,\nfor grafting, true lead is essential.\nLay the foundation, refine the self,\ngather postnatal jade liquid to return the elixir.\nEven if one attains longevity in this world,\none must still seek the ninefold return of golden liquid.\nHow laughable are the multitudes who study immortality—\neach one blindly cultivating without sight,\nstep by step, who understands true investigation and real inquiry?\nThroughout Heaven and Earth, yellow sprouts grow everywhere,\nacross the cosmos, white blossoms bloom in profusion—\nall await the moment when water is exhausted, gold is born, and the moon is full.\nHere, I raise my precious sword and hang it on South Mountain,\nslaying the seven emotions and six desires,\nsweeping away the ten thousand miles of floating clouds,\nleaving not a speck of dust.\nThe Five Ghosts and Three Corpses tremble in fear.\nI invert yin and yang,\nuse divine strategy to secretly harmonize the eight trigrams of the celestial cycle,\ncaution body and mind, guard against danger.\nGently, I shake the earth’s axis,\nslowly, I turn the heavenly gate—\nthen, with a thunderclap, a heaven beyond heaven appears.\n\n---\n\n**A Formula of Celestial Mechanism**\n\nI tell you the true oral formula,\npoint to the moon at the sky’s edge.\nWhen the moon is full, the jade bud emerges;\nwhen the moon wanes, the golden flower falls.\nAt the third and fifth phases, observe the seasons,\ndistinguish carefully between old and young.\nSend it into the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nlest it leak and escape.\nGraft and graft again—\nthe spirit turtle drinks the golden horse’s blood to the last drop.\nDecisively, decisively—\nbecome a guest of Penglai’s three isles.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Mystic Union at the Pass**\n\nThe Great Dao is beyond words,\nits wondrous principle hard to exhaust—\na single point at the mystic pass is the Dharma’s secret.\nFrom the Kunlun’s mud-pill peak above,\nto the bubbling spring cave below,\nlead is the mother, mercury the father.\nLead and mercury, yin and yang, form the child’s bond,\nthe Alchemical Girl and Infant rest together.\n\n---\n\n**The Song of Yin-Yang Union**\n\nInvert kan within li,\ndragon and tiger meet in wind and cloud.\nA single point of wondrous mystery embraces Heaven and Earth,\nyet people great and small know nothing of it—\nreturning three, revolving five, they penetrate the celestial mechanism.\nLi returns to kan, kan returns to li,\nkan and li, water and fire, move east and west.\nInfant and Alchemical Girl become husband and wife.\nYin steals yang’s essence to take kan’s solidity,\nyang subdues yin’s spirit to fill li’s emptiness—\nthree threes and six sixes divide Heaven and Earth.\nThese practices are not easy,\ntransforming qian and kun risks leaking primordial qi.\n\n---\n\n**Six Refrains of the Grotto’s Pure Chant**\n\nI long to split open the primordial chaos,\ncleave the vast misty aperture.\nI long to find a drop of life-continuing nectar,\nseek a sprig of soul-returning herb.\nI see the tiger’s roar summon the tide,\ngui stirs and the medicine sprouts.\nThe Yellow Dame teaches with her zither,\nthe Metal Elder taps his bamboo clappers.\nUnawares, the Cinnabar Field grows hot—\nthe life-treasure has returned to the Yellow Path.",
      "overlap_context": "irm, the will far-reaching,\nfrom youth I tempered body and mind.\nCut off fame and profit, no greed remains,\nseize the Three Corpses, seethe them in the cauldron.\nMy heart is steadfast,\nmy mastery of creation unseen by others.\nI worry—lest the work go unfulfilled, the name unmade,\ntime pass in vain;\nI worry—lest the sun and moon race like shuttles, praising youth.\nOne day, turning the heavenly gate,\nsoaring midair,\nonly then shall I expound the cold, aloof family tradition of the Daoist teaching.",

enfolding them.\nSuddenly the Mud Pill Palace boils like scalding soup,\nthe Cinnabar Field burns like fire.\nSetting up *zhun* and *meng*, forgetting dawn and dusk,\npervading the four limbs, steaming them through.\nShould demonic visions arise to beckon,\nhere I remain, sitting in suchness, unshaken.\n\nTemper the self, pacifying the Five Thieves,\nshift the scenery, merging the Seven Emotions.\nSubduing the Six Desires to stillness,\nsweeping the Three Fields clean.\nNature settles and naturally becomes numinous,\nthe heart empties and inwardly shines bright.\nMatching hardness

flight,\nthe name is already inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace.\n\nI only await concealing myself in the marketplace to silently cultivate;\nI only await choosing a propitious place to put it into practice;\nI only await wielding the sword of wisdom to nurture the white snow,\nrelying on the craftsman’s hand to plant the yellow sprout;\nI only await moving fire to refine true emptiness,\nseeking light to break through the vast misty aperture;\nI only await gathering the two qi to return to the Li Chamber,\ngathering one yang to enter the Zhen Palace.\n\nFollowing Master Jingyang’s footsteps,\nsoaring aloft riding the cinnabar phoenix;\nemulating the Yellow Emperor’s divine powers,\nascending in flight astride the fire dragon.\nGathering lead essence,\npairing it with mercury sprouts,\nerecting the crucible and furnace,\ncultivating the mysteries’ essentials.\nSeizing the creative mechanism of qian and kun,\ngrasping the wondrous waxing and waning of sun and moon.\nUniting water and fire, burning left and right,\ndirecting hun and po to intermingle and exchange.\nFollowing the four seasons without missing their sequence,\naccord with the eight nodes, responding to the hexagrams’ lines.\nDiscerning dawn and dusk, clarifying growth and decline,\nobserving the heavenly Dao, completing twelve circuits of the celestial sphere.\nThe Seven-Return Great Pearl illuminates the nature,\nthe Nine-Return Golden Elixir completes the Great Medicine.\nWith a thunderous crack,\nthe Perfected One emerges from the crown.\n\n**Two Chants on the Hibernating Dragon Method**\n\n*Fisherman’s Song*\nThe hibernation method is soundless yet resounding,\nthe resounding sound speaks to the inner heart.\nSpirit silent, qi obscure,\nthe hibernating dragon, though

becomes whole.\nQi after qi returns to the mysterious aperture,\nbreath after breath follows nature’s course.\nDo not scatter, must be tranquil,\nnurturing the mercury nature to perfection,\nawaiting

reclining meditation,\nonce nurtured, the true primordial embryo—\nthe hibernating dragon rises and ascends to heaven.\n\nThis hibernation method—who transmitted it?\nFolding arms for a pillow, from Confucius’ mountain,\ndelighting in its midst, unknown to others.\nFive dragons leap and soar from the deep pool,\nHeaven bestowed this method to Tu Nan.\nWho in Tu Nan’s lineage can continue it?\nThe slovenly Daoist Zhang Fengxian.\n\n**Two Lyrics of the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring**\n\nIn the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring, the moon’s wheel hangs high,\njade trees bloom anew, breaking the

and returned elixir are already refined.\nTo make emotion return to nature,\nmust merge nature with emotion.\nWealth and honor, fame and merit—ask no more,\nthe Infant and Alchemical Girl are most enchanting.\nThe furnace and cauldron radiate light—\nfrom here, journey to the Kunlun’s summit.\n\n**West River Moon**\nThe Dao resides in the mysterious pass’s aperture,\nthe aperture contains primordial qi and primordial essence.\nPrimordial essence and primordial qi nurture the primordial spirit,\nwhen the spirit is full, movement and stillness arise naturally.\nMovement and stillness, three revolutions and nine transformations,\ncirculating through the changes of qian and kun.\nReversing qian and kun to plant the flower’s root,\nthe root sprouts, the four rivers’ moon is full.\n\n**Partridge Sky**\nTo battle demons, first battle the sleep demon,\nthis is the first whip in cultivation.\nDiligently enduring one night’s toil,\nin the pot, months change over a thousand

boat,\ndrifting to and fro, not free.\nBoundless and shore-less, hard to moor,\nalways swimming in the perilous realm of fish and dragons.\nIf willing to turn back, that is the shore—\ndo not wait for the wind and waves to wreck your boat.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers delicate—\nthe old tree renews itself with tender branches.\nPeaches grafted to willows,\nmulberries grafted to pears,\npassed down as models for those who cultivate the true.\nSince ancient times, immortals’ grafting methods—\nwhen people grow old, there is medicine to heal.\nSeek a bright teacher, inquire of the myriad methods—\nbeginning practice is already too late.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers verdant—\nflower and wine immortals have claimed them to this day.\nThe brothel’s stronghold,\nthe forest within

kind?\nA hen’s egg cannot hatch a chick,\nfor it has turned its back on the furnace of yin and yang.\nA woman without a husband is a resentful maiden,\na man without a wife is a forsaken bachelor.\nAlas for the deluded, so utterly confused—\nsitting in stillness, cultivating alone, their qi withers dry.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers askew—\nsevered from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.\nGold is cut off from wood, mercury from lead,\nyang widowed, yin orphaned—each to its own side.\nIn the world, yin and yang pair man with woman,\nbegetting sons and grandsons, generation after generation.\nFollowing the flow, one becomes a mortal;\nreversing it, one becomes an immortal—\nall lies in the turning of the cheek.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers newly bloomed—\nborn in the direction of *kun*, and *kun* is human.\nPluck the flower, wear it;\ngather the flower’s heart,\nits layered pistils bright with spring’s splendor.\nYet people do not grasp the principle within the flower—\na single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\nBorrow the flower’s name, embody the flower’s form,\neach line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* speaks truly.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in full bloom—\ntheir smiling faces, delicate features like powdered petals.\nGuard against the monkey and horse, ever more stubborn—\nhang up the iron mask your mother gave you.\nDraw forth the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon,\npluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall.\nHoist the wind-filled sail, return fully laden—\nhow could one journey empty-handed to the mountain of treasure!\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers taking flight—\nonce shed, they open again at the appointed time.\nWhen lead’s flower appears, when *gui* is exhausted,\nonce more the western garden’s branches brim with blossoms.\nJust gathered beneath the moon,\nthey are already mended into robes at dawn’s first light.\nThis mystery is rarely known in the world—\nit must be pondered carefully with the immortals.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in full bloom—\nplucked from within the crescent-moon furnace.\nThey extend life, lessen illness and calamity—\nfind good companions, prepare the means for the method.\nFrom this, the treasure of heaven may be achieved—\nlet the deluded masses laugh at my folly.\nI urge the wise: do not feign cleverness,\nwithout a bright teacher, do not force guesses.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers perfectly round—\nthe fruit ripens, its flavor complete.\nLike a crimson tangerine, like a pellet,\nguard it well, never let down your vigilance.\nLearn the method of plants gathering their essence—\nreturn to life, revert to the root, restore the origin.\nChoose a sacred site, build a Daoist hermitage,\nunite with the primordial to accomplish the great return.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers flourishing—\nspeaking of rootlessness, yet it has roots.\nThe three talents’ apertures, the two true essences—\nwhen heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born.\nWhen sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order;\nwhen man and woman unite, conception begins.\nHow clear this is—\nI tell you plainly,\nonly fear that when you meet it, you will not recognize it truly.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers at their finest—\nfacing the scene, forget emotion, admire the moon’s radiance.\nThe golden essence flourishes, dazzling the eye—\ndo not mistakenly pick the wrong melon in the garden.\nThe five metals and eight minerals are all false,\nthe ten thousand herbs and thousand grasses are all amiss.\nThe golden toad, the jade crow—\nrecognize true lead, and you are the master.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers abundant—\nwhen they bloom everywhere, they span the river of desire.\nHard to pluck, what can be done?\nStep by step, tread the dragon and tiger’s den.\nHaving gathered the yellow flower, return to the cave—\nyour name inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.\nLaughing heartily, oh white clouds—\nprepare the ladder to ascend the Great Canopy.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers fragrant—\nin the warm lead crucible, the treasure’s light appears.\nOn the golden bridge, gaze toward the winding river—\nin the moon, the sun is clearly seen.\nSwallow the raven’s liver and hare’s marrow,\nreplace all the dust and grime of your old intestines.\nThe realm of fame and profit,\nthe land of love and attachment—\nnever turn back, ceaselessly rushing in vain.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers fresh—\ntalisman fire sears mercury and lead together.\nAt the furnace’s edge, the scene appears before you—\ngathering depends entirely on the ferryboat of the method.\nA master craftsman, strong and steady, holds the helm,\nno matter how the vast waves churn in the sea’s depths.\nPass the three barriers, penetrate the mud pill,\nearly on, pierce the nine apertures of the entire body.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers rich—\nrecognize true lead as the primal ancestor.\nEssence, vitality, spirit—\nrefined together in one crucible,\nthe woman transforms into man, the old into youth.\nWishing to capture the White Tiger in the west,\nfirst subdue the Azure Dragon in the east.\nWhen kinds are alike, apply effort well—\nwhen the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers delicate—\nthe tree of heaven’s root, its flowers fair.\nHeaven responds with stars, earth with tides.\nThe dragon-slaying sword, the tiger-binding cord—\nrevolve the celestial pivot, turn the Dipper’s handle.\nTemper a furnace of true sun and moon,\nsweep away the three thousand six hundred paths.\nStep into the clouds, roam freely—\nall sins, all worldly dust, are wiped away in one stroke.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers towering—\nocean waves surge to the sky, the moon plays with the tide.\nThe path of the Silver River,\npiercing the nine heavens,\na ladder climbs the void to moor at the Dipper’s handle.\nTouch the Weaving Maiden’s loom stone,\ntread the Cowherd’s magpie bridge.\nMeeting the immortals’ court, with bold courage,\nsteal the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in pairs—\ndragon and tiger mount the altar, battling fiercely.\nLead enters mercury,\nyin matches yin—\nthe image of the mysterious pearl, its price beyond value.\nThis is the true seed of the homeland,\nreturning the old to youth, lengthening life.\nAscend to heaven, to the land of ultimate bliss—\nspare yourself the wheel of rebirth, the sight of Yama.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers wondrous—\ncultivated in the moon for a brief moment.\nThe hand that grasps clouds, the ladder that climbs them—\ngather the first primordial branch.\nDrinking wine with flowers, the spirit is refreshed,\nlaughing at the immortal elder drunk as mud.\nEntrust your heart to knowledge, guard it carefully—\nonly fear the furnace’s fire timing will fly away.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers golden—\nborn in the central land of *wu* and *ji*.\nThe eastern family’s daughter, the western family’s son—\nmatched as husband and wife, they enter the bridal chamber.\nThe Yellow Dame urges them to drink the ghee-like wine,\neach day intoxicated, steaming with drunkenness.\nThis immortal formula, this soul-returning nectar—\nthe Medicine King who revives the dead and restores life.\n\nThe rootless tree, its flowers radiant—\nthe moon’s essence, heaven’s heart, presses upon the sun’s soul.\nThe golden crow’s marrow, the jade hare’s essence—\nseize these two, refine them together in one
