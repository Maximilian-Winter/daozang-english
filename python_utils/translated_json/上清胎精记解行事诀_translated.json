Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. An abridged adaptation from *The Central Record of Fetal Essence Scripture*. One scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n\n---\n\n**The Upper Clarity Scripture on Unbinding the Fetal Essence Knots: Ritual Instructions**\n\nThe upper region of the womb contains four knots: the first resides in the Mud-Pill Palace, the second in the mouth, the third in the cheeks, and the fourth in the Moon. To unbind these four upper knots, on the day of one’s life-destiny at dawn, enter a chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens. Strike the teeth nine times, and thrice invoke the taboo name of the Primordial Father, *Daohui*. Then bow three times toward the southeast, thrice invoking the taboo name of the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens, *Hundunhuan*.\n\nSit facing the direction of one’s life-destiny, close the eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: nine inches and nine parts in height, clad in a sash of dark-yellow plain numinous silk, his head adorned with a seven-tiered cap of pearls and jade, crowned with the *Wuji Jinxian* coronet. He dwells in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace of the Nine Heavens, the Cinnabar Numinous Realm of the Jade Treasure Prefecture within the Cavern Mystery Precinct. He rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, attended by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending into one’s body to govern the realm of the Mud-Pill Palace.\n\nNext, visualize the Mysterious Mother: six inches and six parts in height, clad in a nine-colored sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-like gauze, and embroidered silk. Her head is crowned with the *Ziyuan Xuanhuang* treasure coronet. She dwells in the Jade Grove of Sevenfold Radiance within the Cavern Mystery Prefecture of the Jade Treasure, the Ninefold Radiance Realm of the Upper Clarity Precinct above the Nine Qi of the Infinite. She rides a flying canopy of purple clouds and feathered essence, attended by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending into one’s body to govern the Cavern Chamber of the face.\n\nVisualize the Father and Mother transforming into blue and yellow qi, intertwining and coiling above the head and face.\n\nWhen complete, strike the teeth nine times and softly recite the incantation:\n*\"So-and-so (one’s name) receives the transformation of the Nine Numinosities, yet the knotted qi remain impure, obstructed and bound, congesting the numinous gates. Reverently, on this day of my life-destiny, I report to the lofty dawn: Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, descend to illuminate my body. The Eight Radiant Sceneries shine as one, the Nine Heavens unite in perfection. Together, unbind the four knots of the upper womb-root. Return the numinous to fill the gates, the nine apertures knotted into immortality. The inner embryo refines and transforms, the Nine Elixirs congeal the spirit. Blue transmutes to red, the two qi entwine. Longevity equals the Three Luminaries, eternally enjoying boundless years.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi eighty-one times and cease.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly King of *Yudan Wuliang*, surnamed *Hun*, taboo name *(Yu + Shi + Biao) (Yu + Shi + Biao) Luo*, clad in a nine-colored, seamless, naturally patterned fur robe, his head crowned with the *Yaojing Riyuan*.

He governs the Jade Capital Cloud Metropolis of Heaven, riding a nine-colored flying swan and threefold plain flying clouds, attended by twenty-four jade maidens of plain numinosity.\n\nVisualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together above one’s head and face, transforming into blue, purple, and yellow qi, swirling in primordial chaos like layered clouds. They enter through the apertures of the mouth, eyes, and nose, enveloping the entire face. Then, raise the head and pray:\n*\"Great Kings of the Three Heavens, Ninefold Mysterious Immortals, unbind for me the knots of the head’s barriers. Transform the Nine Elixirs naturally, descending upon the Golden Gate of Essence. Intermingle the clouds of the Three Perfected, flowing into my body to perfect my spirit. Scour away the qi of death, eradicate the womb-root. Fill and secure the numinous radiance, casting aside all calamities. Knot by knot, unbind; joint by joint, receive the Perfected. Mysterious radiance flows and spreads, penetrating the imperial abyss. My name is spoken in the Nine Heavens. Return the embryo to transform into an immortal. Inner fullness, outer abundance—within and without, I become a spirit.\"*\n\nWhen finished, raise the head and swallow qi nine times, then cease.\n\nNext, visualize the Eight Radiant Lads of the Upper Region.\n\nWith eyes closed, summon them:\n- **Brain Spirit**, named *Juewuzi*, styled *Daodu*. One inch and two parts in height, clad in white brocade, his head crowned with a three-ridge treasure coronet.\n- **Hair Spirit**, named *Xuanfuhua*, styled *Daoheng*.

Seven inches in height, clad in a crimson brocade flying skirt, his head crowned with the *Jinxian* coronet.\n\nVisualize the Eight Radiant Sceneries of the Upper Region, each settled in its proper place, all resembling the form of infants, arrayed in perfect order, as if seen face-to-face.\n\nThen strike the teeth eight times and softly pray:\n*\"Upper Radiance, one region—eight spirits containing the Perfected. Knotted qi of the Nine Elixirs transform to perfect my body. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, dispersing like clouds and mist, descending to envelop the head and face. Bestow the numinous, spread the spirit. Above, unbind the knots; in the center, eradicate the womb-root; below, remove obstructions. Unblock and regulate the Three Barriers. The Eight Radiant Sceneries guard the body, sharing the same age as the numinous. Imperial Lord and Mysterious Mother, turn and return to the lofty dawn. Descend your jade splendor upon me, halt my decline, restore my freshness. Return my countenance to crimson youth, my face transformed into a Golden Immortal.\"*\n\nTransforming the radiance to chase the lightning, one directly reaches the Gate of the Sun. Once complete, tilt the head back and swallow eight breaths to conclude, then ingest the talisman of the Nine Elixirs’ Yang Spirit. This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on blue paper—three copies. Facing one’s life-star, strike the teeth nine times and softly intone:\n\n*\"Above, the Nine Qi transform; refining the hundred spirits within. Internally, the Six Palaces are ordered; externally, the Great Immortals descend. Imperial Lord in his station, Mysterious Mother brewing the divine fluid—unbind the knots, disperse the obstructions, sever and extinguish the womb-root. The body lightens, the flesh takes flight, responding to qi as naturally as breath. Ascend with me, together before the Emperor.\"*\n\nOnce complete, swallow the talisman and cease after nine gulps.\n\nThe Central Region contains four knots: the first knot resides within the Five Viscera; the second in the Great Granary; the third in the Large Intestine; and the fourth in the Small Intestine. To dissolve the four knots of the Central Region, on the day of one’s life-star at noon, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father. Strike the teeth nine times and thrice invoke the Primordial Father’s taboo name. Then turn toward the southeast and bow three times, facing the Mysterious Mother, thrice invoking the Mysterious Mother’s taboo name. Return to sit upright facing one’s current age, strike the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: nine inches and nine fen in height, draped in a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, head crowned with a seven-tiered pearl-and-jade cap, the Limitless Advancement Noble Crown, dwelling in the Jade Palace of the Supreme Ultimate atop the Nine Heavens, within the Vermilion Spirit Precinct of the Jeweled Treasure Repository in the Cavernous Primordial Hamlet. He rides a flying chariot of azure mist, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest to enter the Five Viscera within one’s body.\n\nNext, visualize the Mysterious Mother: six inches and six fen in height, clad in a nine-colored sash of luminous brocade and frost-like gauze, head crowned with the Purple Primordial Dark-Yellow Jeweled Crown, dwelling above the Nine Qi and the Limitless in the Sevenfold Radiance Vermilion Chamber of the Jeweled Grove, within the Jeweled Treasure Cavernous Primordial Repository of the Ninefold Radiance Precinct in the Upper Clarity Hamlet. She rides a purple-cloud flying canopy of feathered essence, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast to enter one’s Five Viscera.\n\nVisualize the father and mother transforming into green and yellow qi, swirling in primordial chaos like a round sun, illuminating the Five Viscera, their radiance shining within and without. Tilt the head back and intone:\n\n*\"Father’s spirit, Mother’s essence—two qi conjoined as one. The Nine Elixirs coagulate and transform, knitting a womb of purple jade. Surveying the radiance of the Supreme Subtlety, the life-thread unites the Nine Spirits. Imperial Lord unfolds the spirit, flowing the true to irrigate life. The Five Viscera’s knots and networks, the Six Palaces cleansed and bright—stomach’s tube opens to clarity, the nine apertures gleam with light. Old knots scatter and vanish; a new embryo flourishes anew. Transforming the radiance, refining the marrow, crowned with the Nine Stars, the Three Luminaries winging the regions, flying into the Imperial Court.\"*\n\nOnce complete, cease after swallowing forty-five breaths.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly King of Serene Stillness: surname Ban, taboo name Xia (雨+十+庆), clad in a seven-colored dragon-patterned robe of penetrating light, head crowned with the Yin Essence Night-Shining Diadem, governing atop the Vermilion Palace’s Jeweled Terrace. He rides an Eightfold Radiance Flying Wheel, accompanied by twelve Jade Immortals.\n\nThen visualize the Heavenly King of Unyielding Joy: surname Ning, taboo name (雨+十+湏)(雨+十+注)(雨+十+持) Wu, clad in a nine-colored robe of flying-frost cloud-patterned brocade, head crowned with the Azure Florescence Year-Star Dark Essence, governing in the Nine-Tiered Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Radiance Vermilion Chamber.

He rides a flying phoenix of soaring auroras and a purple wheel, accompanied by thirty-six Jade Immortals of the Supreme Perfected.\n\nVisualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together into the Five Viscera within one’s body, transforming into red, white, and black qi, swirling in primordial chaos like clouds of mist, entering through the heart’s aperture to envelop the Five Internals. Then softly intone:\n\n*\"The Nine Elixirs coagulate the spirit; the Three Qi intertwine and bind. The Dark Perfected fill and descend—within and without, bright and fresh. The Great Granary opens and unblocks; intestines and stomach knot into immortality. Sever and extinguish the stem of knots, scatter and remove the old roots. Three harmonies form a covenant; the Nine Transformations coagulate the spirit. Return the essence to the Jade Womb to complete my body. Nine-colored Dark-Yellow, flowing essence irrigating the fluids—washing away accumulated obstructions, within, no dregs or dust remain. Floral branches contain the elegant; planting the numinous root. Aperture by aperture, luminous and bright; joint by joint, cool and clear. Bones transform, radiance takes flight—ascending to the Purple Heavens.\"*\n\nOnce complete, cease after swallowing nine breaths.\n\nNext, visualize the Eight Radiant Spirits of the Central Region.\n\nClose the eyes and visualize them thus:\n\nThe Spirit of the Throat is named Bai Liu Fang, styled Dao Tong.

Then ingest the inner talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Embryonic Knots.\n\nThe talisman is inscribed in vermilion on bamboo membrane—three pieces. Once the visualization is complete, face the Year-Star and ingest them. Softly recite the incantation:\n\nThis is but a talismanic seal,\nNot a commanded talisman or spell.\nThe four knots of the Upper Region\nSecure the mud-pill palace of man,\nBathe the radiant countenance in splendor,\nHeavenly beings flourish like fern.\nThe four knots of the Middle Region\nGather ill omens into throngs,\nEnsnare and bind the Great Granary,\nHasten the wandering hun-soul,\nLure demons to conspire,\nScatter dreams and disrupt focus.\nThe four knots of the Lower Region\nBind the posterior gate of man,\nObstruct the nine apertures,\nSever the root of life.\nThe Thearch proclaims the numinous,\nThe Jade Script of the Nine Heavens,\nDissolves the knotted nodes,\nEradicates all roots of affliction.\nThe Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother\nNurture and nourish the Three Passes.\nThe Eight Radiant Spirits stand guard,\nTrue qi disperses and divides.\nAbove, azure; below, yellow;\nWithout, square; within, round.\nExterior and interior alike purified,\nDescending to the Three Origins,\nOne attains to ride the Eight Radiant Spirits,\nSoaring through clouds and streaming mist,\nAscending empty space and mounting the void,\nTo ascend and reach the Golden Gate.\n\nAfterward, looking upward, swallow the twelve qi, and swallow the saliva twenty-four times to conclude.\n\nIn the fourth month, one must receive the qi of the Heaven of Extended Longevity. On the seventh day at dawn, the seventeenth day at noon, and the twenty-seventh day at midnight—three days and three times within the month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, burn incense, bow nine times to the northwest toward the Primordial Father, and three times to the southeast toward the Mysterious Mother. Then, facing the established month, sit upright, strike the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize summoning the Heavenly King of Extended Longevity, surnamed Zi, named Luoluo. He wears a robe of nine-colored, tripled cloud-patterned brocade and the Heavenly Origin Treasure Crown. He governs the Jade Capital Spirit Metropolis Palace in Heaven, riding the Nine Numinous Flying Swans and the Threefold Plain Clouds, accompanied by twenty-four Jade Maidens of the Plain Spirit. Descend and enter your Yellow Court Palace. Visualize a cloud of yellow qi, dense and swirling, encircling your form. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into your mouth and swallow it nine times. Softly recite the incantation:\n\nThe three hun are now at peace,\nThe seven po are now at rest.\nHeaven arrays the Five Lodges,\nThe body aligns with the Seven Stars.\nTen thousand spirits attend in formation,\nThe Mysterious Perfected exhale the numinous.\nJade mushrooms flow and pour,\nThoroughly irrigating the five forms.\nInternally replete, externally overflowing,\nThe hidden passes become bright and clear.\nReturn to refine the marrow,\nReverse white to azure.\nRoam at will through transformations,\nExit darkness and enter obscurity,\nRide the void and fly through space,\nAscend to reach the Moon Court.\n\nAfterward, swallow the qi nine times and stop. Be diligent, be diligent.\n\nThe talisman is inscribed in azure on bamboo membrane. Face your life-star and ingest three pieces at three times, to penetrate the intestines, refine the marrow, transform the bones, and congeal the spirit. After three years, one will ascend in flight, and flesh and bones alike will attain transcendence.\n\nRecite the talisman incantation:\n\nHeaven crimsons, Earth ascends,\nThe two qi descend in mutual exchange.\nThe Nine Yangs transform,\nCongealing essence within the chamber.\nThe Eight Radiant Spirits disperse the numinous,\nThe Six Palaces flourish within.\nTen thousand spirits are all purified,\nEternally enjoying the Great Yang,\nTo the end of heaven and earth,\nEverlasting joy without end.\n\nAfter ingesting the talisman, swallow the qi nine times to conclude.\n\nHere ends the *Upper Clarity Scripture on Embryonic Essence: The Method for Dissolving Knots*.",

Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. An abridged adaptation from *The Central Record of Fetal Essence Scripture*. One scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n\n---\n\n**The Upper Clarity Scripture on Unbinding the Fetal Essence Knots: Ritual Instructions**\n\nThe upper region of the womb contains four knots: the first resides in the Mud-Pill Palace, the second in the mouth, the third in the cheeks, and the fourth in the Moon. To unbind these four upper knots, on the day of one’s life-destiny at dawn, enter a chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens. Strike the teeth nine times, and thrice invoke the taboo name of the Primordial Father, *Daohui*. Then bow three times toward the southeast, thrice invoking the taboo name of the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens, *Hundunhuan*.\n\nSit facing the direction of one’s life-destiny, close the eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: nine inches and nine parts in height, clad in a sash of dark-yellow plain numinous silk, his head adorned with a seven-tiered cap of pearls and jade, crowned with the *Wuji Jinxian* coronet. He dwells in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace of the Nine Heavens, the Cinnabar Numinous Realm of the Jade Treasure Prefecture within the Cavern Mystery Precinct. He rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, attended by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending into one’s body to govern the realm of the Mud-Pill Palace.\n\nNext, visualize the Mysterious Mother: six inches and six parts in height, clad in a nine-colored sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-like gauze, and embroidered silk. Her head is crowned with the *Ziyuan Xuanhuang* treasure coronet. She dwells in the Jade Grove of Sevenfold Radiance within the Cavern Mystery Prefecture of the Jade Treasure, the Ninefold Radiance Realm of the Upper Clarity Precinct above the Nine Qi of the Infinite. She rides a flying canopy of purple clouds and feathered essence, attended by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending into one’s body to govern the Cavern Chamber of the face.\n\nVisualize the Father and Mother transforming into blue and yellow qi, intertwining and coiling above the head and face.\n\nWhen complete, strike the teeth nine times and softly recite the incantation:\n*\"So-and-so (one’s name) receives the transformation of the Nine Numinosities, yet the knotted qi remain impure, obstructed and bound, congesting the numinous gates. Reverently, on this day of my life-destiny, I report to the lofty dawn: Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, descend to illuminate my body. The Eight Radiant Sceneries shine as one, the Nine Heavens unite in perfection. Together, unbind the four knots of the upper womb-root. Return the numinous to fill the gates, the nine apertures knotted into immortality. The inner embryo refines and transforms, the Nine Elixirs congeal the spirit. Blue transmutes to red, the two qi entwine. Longevity equals the Three Luminaries, eternally enjoying boundless years.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi eighty-one times and cease.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly King of *Yudan Wuliang*, surnamed *Hun*, taboo name *(Yu + Shi + Biao) (Yu + Shi + Biao) Luo*, clad in a nine-colored, seamless, naturally patterned fur robe, his head crowned with the *Yaojing Riyuan*. He governs the Infinite Mystery Terrace of the Heaven Without Measure, riding a nine-unicorn jade wheel, attended by twenty-four jade immortals.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly King of *Shangshang Chanshan Wuliangshou*, surnamed *Xi*, taboo name *(Yu + Duo) (Yu + Shi) (Yu + Le)*, clad in a nine-colored fur robe of *Zhicheng* cloud patterns, his head crowned with the *Huijing Riguan*. He governs the Vermilion Grove Seven-Treasure Jade Terrace of the Heavenly King’s Realm, riding a twelve-black-tortoise flying canopy of azure feathers, attended by thirty-two jade lads of the Upper Palace.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly King of *Xuyan*, surnamed *Zi*, taboo name *(Yu + Ti) (Yu + Tou) Luo*, clad in a nine-colored fur robe of *Sanfa* cloud patterns, his head crowned with the *Tianyuan Baoming*. He governs the Jade Capital Cloud Metropolis of Heaven, riding a nine-colored flying swan and threefold plain flying clouds, attended by twenty-four jade maidens of plain numinosity.\n\nVisualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together above one’s head and face, transforming into blue, purple, and yellow qi, swirling in primordial chaos like layered clouds. They enter through the apertures of the mouth, eyes, and nose, enveloping the entire face. Then, raise the head and pray:\n*\"Great Kings of the Three Heavens, Ninefold Mysterious Immortals, unbind for me the knots of the head’s barriers. Transform the Nine Elixirs naturally, descending upon the Golden Gate of Essence. Intermingle the clouds of the Three Perfected, flowing into my body to perfect my spirit. Scour away the qi of death, eradicate the womb-root. Fill and secure the numinous radiance, casting aside all calamities. Knot by knot, unbind; joint by joint, receive the Perfected. Mysterious radiance flows and spreads, penetrating the imperial abyss. My name is spoken in the Nine Heavens. Return the embryo to transform into an immortal. Inner fullness, outer abundance—within and without, I become a spirit.\"*\n\nWhen finished, raise the head and swallow qi nine times, then cease.\n\nNext, visualize the Eight Radiant Lads of the Upper Region.\n\nWith eyes closed, summon them:\n- **Brain Spirit**, named *Juewuzi*, styled *Daodu*. One inch and two parts in height, clad in white brocade, his head crowned with a three-ridge treasure coronet.\n- **Hair Spirit**, named *Xuanfuhua*, styled *Daoheng*.

Five inches in height, clad in a white brocade plain skirt, his head crowned with a three-ridge treasure coronet.\n- **Spine Spirit**, named *Yilifu*, styled *Daozhu*. Three inches and five parts in height, clad in white jade plain robes, his head crowned with the *Xuanyuan* treasure coronet.\n- **Nose Spirit**, named *Zhonglongyu*, styled *Daowei*. Two inches and five parts in height, clad in a blue-yellow plain brocade flying skirt, his head crowned with the *Yuanyou* coronet.\n- **Tongue Spirit**, named *Shiliangzhi*, styled *Daoqi*. Seven inches in height, clad in a crimson brocade flying skirt, his head crowned with the *Jinxian* coronet.\n\nVisualize the Eight Radiant Sceneries of the Upper Region, each settled in its proper place, all resembling the form of infants, arrayed in perfect order, as if seen face-to-face.\n\nThen strike the teeth eight times and softly pray:\n*\"Upper Radiance, one region—eight spirits containing the Perfected. Knotted qi of the Nine Elixirs transform to perfect my body. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, dispersing like clouds and mist, descending to envelop the head and face. Bestow the numinous, spread the spirit. Above, unbind the knots; in the center, eradicate the womb-root; below, remove obstructions. Unblock and regulate the Three Barriers. The Eight Radiant Sceneries guard the body, sharing the same age as the numinous. Imperial Lord and Mysterious Mother, turn and return to the lofty dawn. Descend your jade splendor upon me, halt my decline, restore my freshness. Return my countenance to crimson youth, my face transformed into a Golden Immortal.\"*",
