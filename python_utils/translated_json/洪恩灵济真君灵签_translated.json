Text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Section Zheng Yi\n\n---\n\n**First Lot** (Most Auspicious)\nDragon’s stratagems and leopard’s tactics brew wondrous schemes;\nWhen meeting a bright era, present your plans.\nThe world’s ways are stormy, full of bold might—\nBest to ponder rise and fall in stillness deep.\n\n**Second Lot** (Supreme Auspiciousness)\nAuspicious dreams first portend blessings bright;\nSeek their meaning with care, weigh them aright.\nIf a son fails the mulberry-bow’s ambition grand,\nA noble post may yet come with jade in hand.\n\n**Third Lot** (Middle)\nWhen the Green Emperor reigns in season’s due,\nRed blooms and pale greens sigh on branches’ view.\nIf the Western Wind stirs in Shanglin’s night,\nDoes the traveler afar know wrong from right?\n\n**Fourth Lot** (Lower)\nBarbarian strife brings all to naught;\nTheir kindness and rites revert to what once was taught.\nZou Yang languishes in prison, his fate unknown—\nWho will present the plea of Lady Ti Ying’s tone?\n\n**Fifth Lot** (Greatly Auspicious)\nStroll the path ahead, rein your steed with ease;\nBest to cross the river with boat and oars at peace.\nTonight the bright moon fills the wheel entire,\nTen thousand li of cloud-lanes stretch ‘neath heaven’s spire.\n\n**Sixth Lot** (Greatly Auspicious)\nA single current surges, eastward bound;\nThe world now gazes at the vast expanse profound.\nWest Mountain’s hounds bark idly ‘neath moon and breeze—\nFrom here, the path to azure clouds finds ease.\n\n**Seventh Lot** (Lower)\nA frail, ailing frame defies all cure;\nHold back the finest remedies, their power unsure.\nWhen Rabbit meets Ram, fortune shall arise—\nLest joy turn to grief before your eyes.\n\n**Eighth Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nLose an ox, a horse—no cause for woe;\nWhy fret over trifles in life’s ebb and flow?\nWhen spring begins or winter’s end draws near,\nLet not the fair one seek her fortune by the roadside clear.\n\n**Ninth Lot** (Lower)\nThin clouds and lingering mist yet veil the sky;\nEast, west, south, north—no path runs high.\nCast your lot where life first took its root,\nAs autumn’s leaf drifts past the crow and goose.\n\n**Tenth Lot** (Middle)\nNews fills the hall—no need for more;\nFalse words may come—dismiss their lore.\nA man’s marriage shall end in joy untold,\nYet doubt unresolved may mar the tale foretold.\n\n**Eleventh Lot** (Most Auspicious)\nRed-sealed decrees arrive, their clay broken wide;\nTen thousand li of azure clouds swell with pride.\nThe osprey soars—good tidings fill the air—\nLinger not ‘neath mountain groves or forests fair.\n\n**Twelfth Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nThe frozen vale revives with spring’s return,\nNo need for idle blooms to blame the breeze’s turn.\nBeyond the thaw, a message spreads its cheer—\nBlue-green branches burst with life sincere.\n\n**Thirteenth Lot** (Middle-Fair)\nPerch fat, wine fine—autumn’s call draws near;\nA thousand acres of waves—can the hook cast here?\nThe gulls betray the scheme, their flight in vain;\nHow bear the moon’s full glow upon the homebound main?\n\n**Fourteenth Lot** (Upper)\nI am strong, they weak—plant the banner low;\nSpeak not of injustice to those who go.\nThough rain clears and clouds disperse, the storm may stay,\nYet spring’s first breeze will make all clear as day.\n\n**Fifteenth Lot** (Lower)\nWhy measure thrice when once will do?\nWings stretch toward the southern sky’s bright hue.\nSuddenly, a hindrance blocks the way—\nEven if it succeeds, it may not stay.\n\n**Sixteenth Lot** (Lower)\nA soldier wanders far at heaven’s edge;\nThe Tiger watches from the northeast’s ledge.\nEyes strain, the soul dissolves—no word is sent;\nA branch of pear blossoms weeps in rain’s lament.\n\n**Seventeenth Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nThe Vermilion Bird rules the south’s domain,\nNo need to ask of descendants’ bane.\nWhere waves are calm, step forth with care;\nBeware the sting of wasp and ginger’s snare.\n\n**Eighteenth Lot** (Middle)\nA noble guest at Dragon Gate brings joy anew,\nHeaven’s thoroughfare awaits—climb high, pursue.\nIf asked to praise or clear the path ahead,\nThe hare’s meager skill sighs at firewood’s thread.\n\n**Nineteenth Lot** (Middle)\nTen thousand shifts on branches never cease;\nVows ‘twixt sworn siblings breed enmity’s increase.\nBest to swiftly mend past wrongs with haste,\nBow to Buddha, seek the gods—then fears erase.\n\n**Twentieth Lot** (Auspicious)\nPeach and plum in noble gardens fade,\nTheir dew-kissed toil no longer charms the glade.\nA single note of wind and cloud strikes true—\nSpeak not of brocade robes and homecoming’s hue.\n\n**Twenty-First Lot** (Middle)\nWhy crave wealth and gain with greed untold?\nSweet words may deceive—do not take their gold.\nAll merchants thrive on profit’s tide,\nJoyful hues bloom in the southeast’s pride.\n\n**Twenty-Second Lot** (Auspicious)\nCarriages and riders come and go,\nIdle blooms and cold buds urge them so.\nWithout the east wind’s gentlest touch,\nThey steal to the wall’s top ‘neath midnight’s hush.\n\n**Twenty-Third Lot** (Lower)\nNot that a heart’s hard to find,\nYet oxen laden with books leave none behind.\nFate’s threads will clarify in time’s embrace—\nWho in woods and springs finds a kindred grace?\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Lot** (Auspicious)\nLofty horns rise above the flock,\nYet incense’s scent still fails to shock.\nWhen cassia seeds spread fragrance true,\nA name by the sun’s side shall shine anew.\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Lot** (Lower)\nAbove, it feeds on withered earth; below, the yellow springs;\nTwo cranes soar high, each to its own dreams.\nTwo rivers flow—no trace of man is seen;\nThe world’s perils outstrip mountain, stream.\n\n**Twenty-Sixth Lot** (Middle)\nHearts in harmony, joy in accord,\nJade candles and willows bright—blessings poured.\nRejoice! No thief like Zhi haunts your door,\nThree stars at dusk—what more could one implore?\n\n**Twenty-Seventh Lot** (Lower)\nFate is harsh, the body frail—autumn’s toll;\nGhosts and gods conspire in shadows’ scroll.\n‘Neath wind and moon, ‘midst flowers and wine,\nLest fleeting joy turn sorrow’s sign.\n\n**Twenty-Eighth Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nLimited vision fails to grasp creation’s art,\nHeaven’s craft exceeds what mortals start.\nA game of chess—this world’s affairs unfold;\nDragons and snakes on eastern walls take flight untold.\n\n**Twenty-Ninth Lot** (Upper-Middle)\nThe beached fish, its tail crimson, yearns for the stream’s flow,\nA thread of life barely holds—its end seems near, though.\nWait for the Yu Gate’s triple surge to rise,\nThen pearls shall not be cast in darkness’ guise.\n\n**Thirtieth Lot** (Upper)\nCold and heat, chill and flame—mankind grows weary,\nPainting snakes, severing cranes—truth grows dreary.\nYet let no delay bar your gate’s way,\nFor spring’s breeze from the brush commands creation’s sway.\n\n**Thirty-First Lot** (Upper)\nWhy question grief or right and wrong?\nObserve the workings of mankind to glimpse Heaven’s plan.\nFrom the depths of hardship, joy oft springs anew—\nA lone lamp’s flicker rises to brighter flame again.\n\n**Thirty-Second Lot** (Lower)\nJade and stone lie undistinguished on Kun Mountain’s height,\nWhile earthen pots and basins clamor, grating to the ear.\nWhen small departs and great arrives, the time is not yet right—\nCease your hundred schemes, your toil and wearying care.\n\n**Thirty-Third Lot** (Lower)\nSweet and bitter—how oft have you tasted each in turn?\nA life’s six decades pass beneath the wheeling stars.\nAnxious heart like one drunk on the world’s illusions,\nWhy rush and strive, when all is but empty haste?\n\n**Thirty-Fourth Lot** (Lower)\nHeaven and earth, how oft do they meet and part?\nAlone you stand, poised to prop up what’s frail.\nBroken boughs, snapped legs—these fates may not be barred,\nYet the fire burns itself, heedless of its own bale.\n\n**Thirty-Fifth Lot** (Middle)\nSudden winds stir waves where once the ground was still,\nAnd human affairs grow tangled, loud, and rife.\nLike salt and plum entrusted to a master’s skill,\nThe five flavors blend in one harmonious life.\n\n**Thirty-Sixth Lot** (Upper-Middle)\nBarred by distance, letters fail to reach their mark,\nSpring returns to grass and tree, yet light remains dim.\nThe western mountain’s sun sinks, leaving lingering dark,\nBut beyond the heavens, a traveler comes home to him.\n\n**Thirty-Seventh Lot** (Middle)\nWhen water fills the boat, it shifts in but a breath,\nA lone return unsettles, breeding doubt anew.\nThe traveler waits with purpose for the moon’s bright sheen—\nWhy ask the purple fungus when meeting is due?\n\n**Thirty-Eighth Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nA black cloud rises at the lifting of your gaze,\nSeeking fame at heaven’s edge, yet fame eludes your grasp.\nKnock upon the Yellow Bell to sound its fullest praise—\nThen fair winds shall bear you to Penglai’s isles at last.\n\n**Thirty-Ninth Lot** (Middle)\nThe river flows west—where is the boat you seek?\nHow long must you wait for merit’s work to cease?\nBeside you, others whisper tidings to and fro—\nWatch the arrow pierce the clouds this autumn’s lease.\n\n**Fortieth Lot** (Lower)\nGreed for wealth and gain knows no bound,\nYet the northwest wind rises—how to cross the stream?\nThe pearl’s true price demands a patient hand;\nLife is but a dream that drifts to Nanke’s dream.\n\n**Forty-First Lot** (Lower)\nA branch of red and purple asks of fragrant bloom,\nPetal by petal, idle flowers drift on the tide.\nDo orioles and swallows harbor no intent?\nRefrain from speaking of right and wrong outside.\n\n**Forty-Second Lot** (Middle)\nChrysanthemums wither, autumn wanes, all things decay,\nChasing old regrets and joys that slipped away.\nThe black pearl emerges from the sea, its luster veiled,\nPointing eastward where the sun hangs like a cap at day’s fray.\n\n**Forty-Third Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nThe azure bird soars into clouds, yet does not return,\nTrust lingers in the misty, indistinct, and far.\nThe sun sets o’er the Qin tower, thirty thousand li away—\nBeyond the white-clouded hills, green mountains are.\n\n**Forty-Fourth Lot** (Middle)\nSorrow and joy, two hands that clasp and lift,\nTen thousand matters press—what can one do but strive?\nTime is as fragile as an egg beneath a wing,\nYet watch: the final path may lead to open drive.\n\n**Forty-Fifth Lot** (Middle)\nOld gives way to new as yang’s light draws near,\nThe traveler at heaven’s edge gains wealth most rare.\nTurn your head—Lord Yi is but a hand’s span clear,\nGreen toil is vain; cast doubt aside, beware.\n\n**Forty-Sixth Lot** (Middle)\nFame and fortune’s chance meets three lifetimes’ thread,\nA roc’s ten-thousand-mile journey lies flat in your palm.\nOx and horse tread separate paths, yet fall behind instead—\nLike one in the depths of the Kan, proceed with calm.\n\n**Forty-Seventh Lot** (Lower)\nThick clouds emerge from the hollow, yet find no rest,\nHow long detained before the green hills rise in view?\nA mantis strikes the chariot, clashing in vain contest,\nStirring but empty fame in the world’s review.\n\n**Forty-Eighth Lot** (Lower)\nThe world’s ways are childish, beyond all debate,\nYet when affairs reach their end, roots reappear.\nGuard well the clothes within the bamboo chest of fate—\nDo not share your soul’s counsel with ghosts or fear.\n\n**Forty-Ninth Lot** (Upper, Auspicious)\nThe farmer’s fields know no year without harvest’s yield,\nThough times may shift, we ask the ancient sky.\nThe Jade Candle shines bright, fish dream in the field—\nAutumn brings profit, a thousandfold high.\n\n**Fiftieth Lot** (Upper-Upper, Most Auspicious)\nStand briefly by the river’s edge to shun the storm,\nHeaven’s will aligns with man—what more could you implore?\nWait till spring’s warm waves surge through ten thousand gates,\nThen ride the raft straight to the River of Stars’ shore.\n\n**Fifty-First Lot** (Lower)\nOld affections fade, never like the new,\nFifty years and ten more pass in fleeting flight.\nAll matters are decided in the heart’s own view—\nBuilding by the roadside is not worth the fight.\n\n**Fifty-Second Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nThe lone lamp’s wick is trimmed, yet sleep will not descend,\nWiping tears, emotions linger close at hand.\nA message from afar—ten thousand li between—\nYet dawn brings the magpie’s call, a sign so grand.\n\n**Fifty-Third Lot** (Upper, Auspicious)\nThe times are harmonious, the year abundant, the world serene,\nFrom this point, your homeland heralds peace and bliss.\nThe gods rejoice, the people cheer—a fortune is foreseen,\nA hundred years of heart’s desires near completion’s kiss.\n\n*The Spiritual Lots of the Merciful and Efficacious True Lord conclude.*",

cast doubt aside, beware.\n\n**Forty-Sixth Lot** (Middle)\nFame and fortune’s chance meets three lifetimes’ thread,\nA roc’s ten-thousand-mile journey lies flat in your palm.\nOx and horse tread separate paths, yet fall behind instead—\nLike one in the depths of the Kan, proceed with calm.\n\n**Forty-Seventh Lot** (Lower)\nThick clouds emerge from the hollow, yet find no rest,\nHow long detained before the green hills rise in view?\nA mantis strikes the chariot, clashing in vain contest,\nStirring but empty fame in the world’s review.\n\n**Forty-Eighth Lot** (Lower)\nThe world’s ways are childish, beyond all debate,\nYet when affairs reach their end, roots reappear.\nGuard well the clothes within the bamboo chest of fate—\nDo not share your soul’s counsel with ghosts or fear.\n\n**Forty-Ninth Lot** (Upper, Auspicious)\nThe farmer’s fields know no year without harvest’s yield,\nThough times may shift, we ask the ancient sky.\nThe Jade Candle shines bright, fish dream in the field—\nAutumn brings profit, a thousandfold high.\n\n**Fiftieth Lot** (Upper-Upper, Most Auspicious)\nStand briefly by the river’s edge to shun the storm,\nHeaven’s will aligns with man—what more could you implore?\nWait till spring’s warm waves surge through ten thousand gates,\nThen ride the raft straight to the River of Stars’ shore.\n\n**Fifty-First Lot** (Lower)\nOld affections fade, never like the new,\nFifty years and ten more pass in fleeting flight.\nAll matters are decided in the heart’s own view—\nBuilding by the roadside is not worth the fight.\n\n**Fifty-Second Lot** (Middle-Lower)\nThe lone lamp’s wick is trimmed, yet sleep will not descend,\nWiping tears, emotions linger close at hand.\nA message from afar—ten thousand li between—\nYet dawn brings the magpie’s call, a sign so grand.\n\n**Fifty-Third Lot** (Upper, Auspicious)\nThe times are harmonious, the year abundant, the world serene,\nFrom this point, your homeland heralds peace and bliss.\nThe gods rejoice, the people cheer—a fortune is foreseen,\nA hundred years of heart’s desires near completion’s kiss.\n\n*The Spiritual Lots of the Merciful and Efficacious True Lord conclude.*",
