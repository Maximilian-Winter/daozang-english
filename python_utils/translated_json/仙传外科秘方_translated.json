When I saw the sick, it was as if I myself were afflicted, and I frequently prepared medicines to distribute.\n\nOne day, my late father admonished me: \"Giving medicine to others is not as good as giving them formulas, for then the aid you provide will be far-reaching.\" Thereafter, whenever I obtained a verified formula, I shared it with those of benevolent intent.\n\nLater, I retreated into reclusion beyond the worldly realm, abandoning my former studies. Moreover, after enduring the dust and calamities of countless kalpas, all was reduced to ashes, leaving nothing behind. Only the *Collection of Verified External Medicine Formulas*—compiled by Yang Qingsou of Hechuan and transmitted to Wu Ningji, whose son Youzhang passed it to Master Li Shanguan of Xiping, who in turn entrusted it to me—remained. Its formulas are concise and essential, yet regrettably, it has never been printed. Thus, I preserved it alone.\n\nRecently, while traveling through the sacred land of Jinjing, I passed through Yudu. My disciple Xiao Tianni of Fenggang, a scion of a prominent family from Xichang, had studied the Dao at Ziyang Abbey for twenty years. He had previously accompanied me in my travels and was capable of summoning wind and rain to relieve droughts and floods—a testament to his deep karmic affinity with the Dao and his steadfast practice.\n\nHis fellow disciple, Liu Zhirou of Shunchuan, had suffered for years from sores and boils covering his body. He had taken *Jing Huang Tang*, *Bai Du San*, and other medicines, all to no avail. I therefore entrusted him with an external medicine formula, and after taking *Fan Hun Tang* for less than a full course, he was cured. Delighted, Tianni donated his own funds to have the text block-printed and distributed, so that its beneficent intent might circulate widely. In this, his response to prayers for rain or sunshine was indeed fitting.\n\nNevertheless, I recall an old friend who suffered from *guzhui* wind, enduring alternating chills and fever for months, bedridden and beyond the help of many physicians. Finally, a doctor examined him and said: \"Though this is a chronic ailment, there remains an exogenous pathogen in the Shaoyang channel that has not been resolved. If he has taken *Wu Ji San*, it would have been a mistake.\" Upon inquiry, this proved to be the case. The doctor then administered several doses of *Xiao Chai Hu Tang*, which promptly dispelled the chills and fever. He subsequently used this specialty’s *Zhui Feng Wan* and other medicines to address the wind disorder, leading to a full recovery.\n\nMiscellaneous illnesses have their formulas, and febrile disorders have their methods. Only when a physician masters both can they be deemed truly skilled. If one specializes solely in major formulas or external medicine, there is a risk of unknowingly making errors, which would hardly be perfect.\n\nThough the discussions of syndromes and prescriptions in this external medicine text are profoundly reasoned and superior to other formulas, those of discerning judgment must still exercise careful consideration when applying them in practice.\n\nWritten on the first day of the ninth month of the *wuwu* year of the Hongwu era,\nby Zhao Yizhen, Yuanyangzi of Junyi.\n\n---\n\nMedicine has long been esteemed as an art. Since the Divine Farmer Shennong first tasted the hundred herbs, distinguishing their warm, cool, cold, and hot natures to save the people from premature death, his merit has been unparalleled. Later, Bian Que and Hua Tuo mastered its techniques most exquisitely, their treatments and cures verging on the divine. Yet their arts were not fully transmitted. Today’s external medicine is but a remnant of their legacy.\n\nAmong external disorders, carbuncles and abscesses are the most severe. Abscesses differ in their yin-yang and deficiency-excess patterns; a slight error in medication can immediately lead to danger. Other conditions, such as nail-like sores and throat afflictions, are even more lethal. Though there are no shortage of external medicine practitioners in the world, few achieve true mastery.\n\nThe alchemist Zhao Yuanyang of Junyi, renowned for his erudition, inherited the teachings of the Laozi school. His Daoist practice was lofty and pure, surpassing his peers, and his heart was deeply committed to aiding others. He compiled rare and extraordinary medical texts into volumes, but most were lost in the chaos of war and fire. Only the external medicine formulas survived.\n\nIn the autumn of the *wuwu* year, he traveled with his book to Jinjing, lodging at Ziyang Abbey in Yudu—a place where, twenty years earlier, he had transmitted Daoist methods to the abbey’s adept, Xiao Fenggang. Upon his return, he cured Fenggang’s disciple Liu Shunchuan of a chronic, untreatable skin ailment. Fenggang then resolved to have the text printed to broaden its life-saving intent. However, Yudu’s remote valleys made it difficult to find craftsmen, and the project was delayed until the fifth month of the *rentu* year, when Yuanyang ascended as an immortal. Before his passing, he entrusted his disciples with the task of fulfilling his wish, compiling the secret formulas he had received into a single volume.\n\nYuanyang’s own preface, along with Fenggang’s donation for printing, reveals their utmost sincerity and benevolence. The circulation of this book will rescue those in peril and aid in emergencies, ensuring that all who are children may possess it and avoid the sin of filial impiety, and that all who are physicians may possess it and avoid the failing of heartlessness. Herein lies the heart of the benevolent and the filial.\n\nThus, I write this preface, that the diligence of its compilation may not be in vain.\n\nWritten in the *yangfu* month of the Hongwu era,\nby Wu Youren, Youlanfu of Luling.\n\n---\n\n**Immortal-Transmitted Secret External Medicine Formulas**\n*Volume One*\nCompiled by Zhao Yizhen, Yuanyangzi of Junyi.\n\n**Preface and Discourse on Abscesses, Carbuncles, and Dorsal Boils**\n*Section One*\n\nIn external medicine, abscesses and carbuncles are placed before all other ailments because their transformations occur in an instant, and life hangs by a thread.\n\nThough abscesses and carbuncles bear over twenty names, their essence reduces to two: the *yin* and *yang* patterns. Those arising from *yang* are called *yong* (abscesses), characterized by heat and excess; those from *yin* are called *ju* (carbuncles), marked by cold and deficiency.\n\nWhen *yang* erupts, the skin is thin, the color red, the swelling elevated, and often dotted with dozens of pinhole-like openings that cause pain. When *yin* erupts, the skin is thick, the color pale, the swelling hard—like the hide of an ox’s neck—and painless.\n\nThere are also *yin* within *yang*: seeming heat that is not true heat, swelling that is outwardly firm but inwardly deficient, redness without dryness, a desire to ache yet no pus, swelling that rises then subsides, and external fullness with internal flesh decay. And *yang* within *yin*: seeming cold that is not true cold, no swelling yet internal excess, faint redness with dryness, pus with pain, and though the exterior appears unremarkable, the interior is vexed and stifled.\n\nThose with *yin* within *yang* tend to be plump, their flesh taut but their interiors deficient. Those with *yang* within *yin* tend to be lean, their flesh slack but their interiors replete.\n\nMoreover, *yang* may transform into *yin* due to the misapplication of cooling herbs by inept physicians, while *yin* may shift to *yang* through the abrupt use of potent warming formulas. Yet when *yang* turns to *yin*, the condition is more common, and recovery—return to *yang*—remains possible, so survival is frequent. When *yin* turns to *yang*, the condition is rarer, and once lost, *yang* cannot be restored, so death is common. The rare survivors owe their lives to physicians who, by chance, apply the correct method—one in a hundred.\n\nThe term *eruption* refers to what accumulates within and manifests without. Generally, the entire human body is rooted in the five *zang*-organs, and the *qi* of the five *zang* all derive from the stomach’s *qi*. The stomach is the foundation of the five *zang*; it receives grain, and the spleen transforms it to generate *qi*. The spleen governs flesh and muscle, while the stomach’s *qi* transmits to the five *zang*, propelling blood and vessels to circulate through the channels and collaterals, completing a full cycle day and night.\n\nThough abscesses and carbuncles vary in deficiency, excess, cold, and heat, all arise from *qi* stagnation. Their causes are three: internal, external, and neither internal nor external.\n\nInternal causes are assessed at *renying* (the inch pulse on the left wrist, one *fen* before the bar). External causes are assessed at *qikou* (the inch pulse on the right wrist, one *fen* before the bar). If the pulses at *renying* and *qikou* are harmonious, the cause is neither internal nor external.\n\nTheir origins are five:\n1. Epidemic seasonal *qi*,\n2. Internal stagnation of the seven emotions,\n3. Constitutional deficiency with external contraction,\n4. Body heat contending with wind-cold,\n5. Consumption of roasted meats, strong wine, or alchemical minerals—all sources of heat toxin.\n\nFrom these five, pathogenic *qi* stagnates in the stomach. If the stomach’s *qi* is robust and the body replete, the pathogen contends with it, flowing into the channels and collaterals, obstructing where blood and vessels are sluggish, converging and congealing into abscesses. If the stomach’s *qi* is weak and the body deficient, the pathogen prevails, lodging in the channels and collaterals, coagulating and accumulating, causing blood and vessels to stagnate, leading to internal decay and carbuncles.\n\nThus it is said:\n- Outwardly like a millet grain, yet within it may hold a measure of grain;\n- Outwardly like a coin, yet within it may cradle a fist;\n- Vile toxin and pus-filled tracts, an inch long and deeply replete;\n- Pus and blood both withered—treatable with medicine;\n- Foul rot without strands, blood decayed and *qi* depleted;\n- Intestines severed, *yin* exuberant—even immortals cannot heal.\n\nIn treatment, the physician must gauge the patient’s deficiency or excess, discern the cold or heat of the illness, trace its cause, investigate its origin, and only then administer care. Internal and external must correspond; one cannot generalize.\n\nIf the illness erupts from *yang* with extreme heat, one should first regulate the *qi* and harmonize the blood. When *qi* is regulated, toxic *qi* disperses and does not stagnate; when blood is harmonized, vessels flow and the swelling naturally scatters. For *qi* is *yang*, blood is *yin*; when *yin* and *yang* are balanced, the patient is at ease.\n\nExternally, apply cooling medicines to stimulate it. If heat is severe, blood cools and scatters more readily. If it does not scatter, the heat will have abated, yet blood will congeal from the cold—this is the gradual shift from *yang* to *yin*, the root of putrefaction. One must swiftly return to cooling treatment, resolving the external attack on the surrounding blood pathways, draining the already-formed pus and toxin within, and then proceed according to method to achieve success.\n\nIf the illness erupts from *yin* with extreme cold, internally use balanced tonics to diffuse the *qi*, nourish the blood, and support the original *yang*, following the spleen and stomach. Wait until appetite returns and vitality revives, then regulate *qi* and harmonize blood as usual.\n\nExternally, apply warming medicines to mobilize the *qi* and blood throughout the body, revive dead flesh, and draw out toxic *qi*, then use mild warming medicines to disperse it. In cases of extreme cold, or those misled by cold medicines, one may resort to the *Three Revivers* to restore *yang*. The illness will then erupt laterally and recur—this is auspicious, a sign of *yin* transforming into *yang* and renewed life. If internal *yang* does not return and external signs do not appear, this is solitary *yang* severed from *yin*—beyond remedy.\n\nFor *yang* is *qi*, and *yin* is blood. When *yang* moves, *yin* follows; when *qi* circulates, blood flows. If *qi* does not circulate, blood dies; if blood dies, flesh dies; if flesh dies, the illness is fatal.\n\nIn cold patterns, warming medicines are used simply to move *qi* and blood. For blood and *qi* move when warmed and halt when cooled.\n\nThough the skillful use of cooling and warming medicines is essential, one must first administer frankincense and mung bean powder to rescue the heart and protect the membrane. The heart governs the entire body, and the membrane encases the five *zang*. At the onset of illness, toxin invariably attacks the pericardium. Thus, some first experience retching, then abscesses or carbuncles; others first develop abscesses or carbuncles, then retching—because the pericardium’s root lies in the heart.\n\nIf treatment is delayed, the *pericardium*—the heart’s sovereign—suffers from toxin, and the spirit has no refuge; the primordial *qi* then falls into darkness. At the onset of illness, toxin invariably corrodes the flesh at the periphery. If treatment is delayed, the toxic *qi* penetrates the membrane; once the membrane is breached, the primordial *qi* leaks away, the *zang-fu* lose their nourishment, the spirit withers, and the pulse collapses entirely.\n\nThus, those who survive even severe illness are those in whom the five *zang* remain visible and the membrane intact. Yet some die from seemingly minor afflictions—where the flesh has not yet ulcerated but the membrane has already been breached. This is why rescuing the heart and protecting the membrane is the foremost principle.\n\nThis formula was secretly transmitted by immortals, its divine and ingenious workings beyond full description—far beyond the reach of ordinary physicians who rely on mere herbs, needles, or blades. Those who grasp its essence must treasure it well.\n\n**Formula #2: Rong-Wei Fan-Hun Decoction**\n*(Also called Tong-Shun Powder or He Shou-Wu Powder)*\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- *He Shou-Wu* (processed without iron contact)\n- *Dang Gui*\n- *Mu Tong* (peeled, nodes removed)\n- *Chi Shao-Yao* (stir-fried)\n- *Bai Zhi* (unexposed to fire)\n- *Hui Xiang* (stir-fried)\n- *Tu Wu-Yao* (stir-fried)\n- *Chen Zhi-Qiao* (stir-fried with wheat flour; if nausea occurs, stir-fry with ginger juice)\n- *Gan Cao*\n\nThis formula contains only these nine ingredients, in equal parts. Prepare as a decoction with water and wine, adjusting the ratio according to the pattern. For *liu-zhu* (migratory abscesses), add *Du Huo*.\n\n**Dosage:** Four *qian* per dose. For illnesses in the upper body, take after meals; for those in the lower body, take before meals.\n\nThis single remedy is indispensable for *liu-zhu*, *yong-ju* (deep-rooted abscesses), *fa-bei* (back carbuncles), and traumatic fractures. It alone can rescue moribund conditions, revive dead flesh, quell crises before they arise, and eradicate roots after recovery. Its sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy ingredients interact like the four seasons and five phases, waxing and waning in succession—truly an immortal’s miraculous formula. With appropriate modifications, its efficacy is boundless.\n\nWhy? Because this medicine powerfully harmonizes *qi* and regulates blood. *Qi* is *yang*; blood is *yin*. When *yang* moves, *yin* follows; when *qi* circulates, blood flows. If *yang* stagnates, *yin* congeals; if *qi* weakens, blood dies. When blood dies, flesh dies; when flesh dies, the illness is invariably fatal. Thus, one must regulate *yang* and harmonize *yin*—neither can be neglected.\n\nIf only *yang* is regulated without harmonizing *yin*, *qi* dissipates and blood congeals, leaving the flesh lifeless—like the *Wu-Xiang Lian-Qiao* formulas. If only *yin* is harmonized without regulating *yang*, blood flourishes while *qi* weakens, and the illness will recur—like the *Nei-Bu Shi-Xuan* formulas. Yet these two approaches may also be used in combination; rigidity yields no miracles. This formula fortifies the stomach’s root, spares the primordial *qi*, and scours away pathogenic filth, naturally restoring smooth circulation without giving rise to complications—truly an immortal’s elixir.\n\n**Applications and Modifications:**\n\n1. **For long-standing *fa-bei* (back carbuncles) that fail to heal:**\n   This is due to prior excessive use of cooling medicines, which internally injure the spleen and externally freeze the blood. The spleen governs flesh; when it is damaged, appetite wanes, complexion withers, and flesh fails to regenerate. Blood fills the vessels; when it is frozen, *qi* loses its vigor, and flesh putrefies. Thus, the spleen must be regulated—once it is strong, flesh will regenerate. In this formula, remove *Mu Tong*, reduce *Dang Gui*, and double the amounts of *Hou Po* and *Chen Pi*. For severe cases, use the family’s *Dui-Jin Yin-Zi*; for even graver cases, add *Bai Dou-Kou* and the like.\n\n2. **For *liu-zhu* (migratory abscesses):**\n   Add *Du Huo*. *Liu-zhu* arises from *qi* and blood stagnation; when *qi* flows and stagnates, blood pools and congeals. This herb can invigorate the entire body’s blood vessels—once the vessels move, how can *liu-zhu* persist?\n\n3. **For *liu-zhu* arising from *shang-han* (cold damage):**\n   If the exterior has not fully resolved, residual toxin flows into the four limbs’ channels and collaterals, lodging where it stagnates and forming *liu-zhu*.\n   - If the illness still presents tidal fever, the interior retains unresolved cold evil. To this formula, add *Sheng Ma* and *Su Ye*.\n   - If fever persists after taking this, add *Gan Ge*.\n   - If headache is present, add *Chuan Xiong* and decoct with ginger water.\n   - If no tidal fever is present, decoct with equal parts water and wine, as wine powerfully moves blood and generates *qi*. When *qi* is generated and blood flows, recovery is assured.\n\n   Why must *liu-zhu* be treated with exterior-resolving methods? To trace the cause, investigate the source, and not forget the illness’s root. Once cold evil is fully expelled, over-releasing the exterior may lead to *cold liu-zhu*, which is even more difficult to treat. Thus, mild exterior resolution is optimal.\n\n   After releasing the exterior, the second stage calls for warm, neutral medicines—such as *Shi-Xuan* or *Nei-Bu*. If ineffective, the third stage may require adding *Fu-Zi* or administering several doses of *Si-Zhu San*. However, warming medicines must not be overused, lest they exacerbate suffering and prevent pus and blood from drying.\n\n   The fourth stage returns to the original formula to achieve resolution.\n\n   If the exterior is not fully resolved, residual toxin may attach to the bone, forming *gu-yong* (bone abscess). *Liu-zhu* is the remnant toxin of *shang-han*; *gu-yong* is the deteriorated pattern of *liu-zhu*. *Liu-zhu* is not the fault of *shang-han*, but of the physician’s incomplete exterior resolution. *Gu-yong* is not the fault of *liu-zhu*, but of the quack’s excessive use of cooling medicines.\n\n   Quacks, blind in mind and deaf in intent, falsely claim clairvoyance. Even when they recognize *gu-yong*, their treatments lack method. They recklessly administer cooling medicines and apply caustic blades, causing toxic *qi* to stagnate. Cooling medicines and metal instruments drive the toxin deeper into the bone, making it incurable.\n\n   Otherwise, how could human bones develop abscesses? Once bone becomes abscessed, no medicine can cure it—hence the names *fu-gu-ju* (bone-attaching carbuncle) and *bai-hu-fei-shi* (white tiger flying corpse). It lingers for years, shifting and turning, until the cold toxin and decayed bone are fully expelled before healing occurs.\n\nThose that do not heal may persist for a lifetime—all due to initial mismanagement. When the bone decays, if it is an accessory bone, recovery is still possible; but if it is a primary bone, the condition becomes a lifelong disability.\n\nWhen the pus is white and thin, the fragmented bone has just begun to detach, and probing the flesh to retrieve it is difficult. When the pus is yellow and thick, the fragmented bone is about to emerge, and the flesh is shallow enough for retrieval—this should be done with a sharp blade. Details are provided in later chapters. This, however, is but a general outline of treating *gu-yong*.\n\nThere are also cases where the illness has persisted for months, injured by blades, leaving the patient emaciated, limbs contracted, coughing up pus and blood, with decayed flesh and yin putrefaction. This arises from extreme cold, yang weakness, and yin excess—it must not be mistaken for heat due to blood in the sputum. It should be treated with modified formulas containing high-quality *fuzi*.\n\nOther cases begin with toxin arising in the hands, feet, head, or face, causing pain throughout the body, ascending to the neck. Where the meridians converge, the sores resemble strings of pearls—this is a condition of wind-dampness and *qi* stagnation. It should be treated with modified *Xiao Xuming Tang* and *Du Huo Jisheng Tang*, used in conjunction with this formula.\n\nThere are also cases where pain begins in both knees and spreads to all joints, resembling \"blood wind\" in women and \"soft wind\" in men—this is called *fengshi bi* (wind-damp impediment) or *li-jie* (pervasive node). It should be treated with modified *Fuzi Ba Wu Tang*.\n\nWhen abscesses form in the neck, armpits, beside the breasts, or in the soft flesh of the hips, they are called *chenjing yong* (cold abscesses). These are cold conditions without heat and should be treated with *Nei Bu Shi Xuan San*, used in conjunction with this formula. For children, *fuzi* must not be used lightly, lest it provoke fright seizures. Under no circumstances should needles or blades be applied. With thin blood and no pus, the flesh is reluctant to knit—apply warming, damp-dispersing medicines to resolve it internally. If needles or blades are mistakenly used, causing proud flesh to form, this same medicine will still achieve results. Should mild pain or slight seizures occur during treatment, use modified *Quan Xie Guanyin San*. Once the fright subsides, resume the original prescription.\n\nThere are also children with long-standing phlegm misdirected by illness, manifesting abscesses on the neck, arms, chest, or back—this is extreme cold, and success depends entirely on the application of warming medicines. Leaving an opening is preferable, as the condition may require further intervention; treatment methods follow later.\n\nThere is also *liuzhu* as large as a gourd or an overturned bowl appearing on the chest or back. Its symptoms resemble *fa* (effusion) but are far more severe. After administering medicine, if the form and momentum show even the slightest movement, it is no longer *fa*. It should be treated with *Nei Bu Shi Xuan* in conjunction with this formula, adjusted according to the condition, to resolve it internally.\n\nGenerally, all such conditions originate from cold. Where there is pain, it is bone pain—bone being the surplus of the kidney. When the kidney is deficient, the bone becomes cold, and cold bone is the cause of pain. The term *gu-ju* (bone carbuncle) arises from the kidney because its root lies there. Thus, to tonify the kidney, only large doses of *fuzi* can be effective. When the kidney is replete, the bone regains its vitality, and carbuncles will not attach to the bone.\n\nIn administering medicine, one must not be rigid but adaptable. Generally, when *yong* (abscesses) and *ju* (carbuncles) first emerge, they form from *qi* and blood stagnation. Over time, blood accumulates at the site of stagnation, eventually erupting. In patients with abundant *qi* and blood, *danggui* should be reduced in this formula, for excess generates blood, which may cause abscesses to form elsewhere, leading to endless recurrence. This is a secret transmission, rarely known to physicians.\n\nThere are two types of phlegm associated with *yong* and *ju*:\n1. Stomach cold generating phlegm—add *banxia* to this formula to fortify the spleen and transform phlegm.\n2. Heat constraint forming wind-phlegm—add *jiegeng* to this formula to dissolve phlegm in the throat and diaphragm, and decoct with fresh ginger in a mixture of water and wine.\n\nFor *nao-fa* (brain effusion) or *bei-fa* (back effusion) occurring above, remove *mutong* from this formula, lest it drain the lower *yuan*, complicating treatment for conditions of upper excess and lower deficiency. The elderly and weak should especially avoid it.\n\nIf the patient has diarrhea, this formula must not be used immediately. First, administer an antidiarrheal: dissolve raw *baifan* into powder, mix with melted yellow wax to form pills, and take thirty with rice water. Only after the diarrhea ceases should this medicine be used. The human body relies on *qi* and blood as its foundation. In those with abscesses, *qi* and blood surge to one place to form pus. If the viscera are not secure, *yuan-qi* will leak, and the blood will grow colder, making recovery difficult. This formula strongly regulates *qi*.\n\nGenerally, when *qi* flows smoothly, blood circulates; when *qi* is depleted, blood turns cold; when *qi* is cold, blood dies; and when blood dies, flesh does not regenerate. Applying warming medicines may fail to generate flesh if *yuan-qi* is insufficient to sustain it, only adding to suffering. Applying cooling medicines is entirely misguided.\n\nThough this formula was divinely transmitted, its efficacy depends on proper use—otherwise, one risks the folly of \"marking the boat to find the sword.\" As for *liuzhu*, it cannot be treated uniformly. If cooling medicines deplete and scatter *yuan-qi*, some cases may respond to *San Jian*, for such illnesses often stem from cold. One must carefully examine the pulse and differentiate the condition, confirming its cold origin before using such medicines—yet even then, excess is harmful. When the yang pulse revives, the swollen area turns red and lively, and the bone regains vitality, cold *qi* will no longer attach to form carbuncles. At that point, credit the original formula for its success—this is the infallible method.\n\nThis medicine may be prepared as a decoction, powder, or pill, with water or wine as the vehicle, chosen as circumstances dictate. For the affluent, coat it with *muxiang*. If the patient has heat-phlegm and cough, the wealthy may take it with *chenxiang*, the poor with *suye* decoction. For pills, use honey as the binder.\n\nThis formula is not only for treating *yong*, *ju*, *fa-bei* (effusion of the back), and fractures—it is also effective for men and women with *shan-qi* (hernia) or blood *qi* conditions, with repeated success. There was a woman who suffered from a *qi* illness for five years. When it flared, she experienced only lump pain, retching, and an inability to keep down water or food. Each episode brought her near death. She took this medicine as pills with *muxiang* decoction...\n\nA single dose stops the retching; a second dose harmonizes phlegm and qi, and she was cured.\n\nAll cases of fractures and injuries invariably rely on this formula, though adjustments in additions and subtractions vary—details are found in the section on fractures and injuries. For common bruises, breaks, or damage, including injury to the pericardium, it treats all. If the injury is on the head, remove *mutong* and *zhike*, and add *chuanxiong* and *chenpi*. Routinely adding *dingpi* and *suye* activates blood; adding *poguzhi* and *wulingshi* breaks up static blood. Boil the decoction thoroughly, then steep it in a cup of strong wine. When it boils again, add *dahuang* powder and take it on an empty stomach. If the bowels move smoothly, only four doses are needed: the first two include *dahuang* powder, while the latter two omit it, merely promoting descent. If the bowels do not move, use *zhike* decoction to stimulate them continuously. If still no movement occurs, the condition is untreatable. One must not sit idly by while a person dies without knowing why. Consider formulas like *Buxue Shixuan San* and others.\n\nFor all fractures and injuries, this formula may omit *mutong* and be called *Heshouwu San*, as *heshouwu* supports blood. For blade wounds with tidal fever, facial swelling, and panting—signs of *poshangfeng* (tetanus)—take *Suoxue San* and *Gegen Tang* for several doses, or decoct *jiang* and *cong* for dispersing, or take *Baidusan* three or four times. Externally, apply topical medicines according to method; none will fail to heal.\n\nFor chronic lumbar pain, add *caobixie* and *xuanhusuo*, and decoct with wine. For *jiaoqi* (leg qi), add *binglang*, *mugua*, and *chuanshanjia*, and decoct with water.\n\nPhlegm that has lost its proper path is not only unrecognized by others but, since its transmission from the immortals, only my lineage has known of it. Phlegm lubricates the entire body like a fish’s slime. When phlegm resides in the stomach and remains still, there is no illness; when it stirs, a hundred diseases arise—wheezing, coughing, retching, dizziness, headaches, eye pain, generalized stiffness, and painful joints are all caused by newly accumulated phlegm, formed from the败浊 congealing of blood and qi. Why? When the qi of the viscera and bowels rebels and stagnates, phlegm is born; when sweat should be released but is not, phlegm accumulates; when food and drink are overconsumed, fluids fail to move and gather into phlegm. Normally, phlegm travels from the stomach cavity to the lung tract and exits. When it loses its path, it scatters from the stomach cavity into the cold flesh, muscles, and skin. The spleen governs muscles, and the lungs govern skin and hair, so phlegm may lodge in the chest, back, head, neck, armpits, hips, waist, legs, hands, or feet, forming hard lumps—painful or painless—with no flush of blood upon pressure. Even if slightly red, the color is pale and cool, hard as stone. When broken, there is no pus, only thin blood, clear fluid, or milky liquid; sometimes, spoiled flesh resembles torn cotton, or like scrofula nestled in the skin and flesh, resembling a parrot’s egg floating in water—movable, soft, and not hard. When pierced, no pus or blood emerges, and the wound gapes with protruding flesh. The only sensation is phlegm obstructing the throat, with alternating chills and fever—these are its signs. Urgently add *nanxing* and *banxia* to this formula to treat internally, and externally apply *Yulong* hot medicine to draw out the toxin, allowing it to form pus and rupture for the best outcome. In milder cases without pus, it will resolve internally. If heat is extreme and phlegm congested, use *Kongxian Dan*—equal parts *zidaji*, *gansui*, and *baijiezi*—ground into powder and made into pills with rice paste.\n\nIf hard lumps the size of cups or bowls appear in critical areas like the throat or neck, the condition is especially difficult to treat. When blood and qi flow harmoniously, no other illness arises; when qi flows improperly, blood transforms into phlegm. If phlegm further loses its path, blood and qi decline and fail to form pus, only producing swelling and hardness—this is inevitable. This syndrome involves more yin than yang, so treat according to the pattern: restore yang, generate qi, supplement blood, and expel phlegm. Externally, use subsequent methods to rouse the body’s qi and blood and disperse cold lumps. If swelling does not subside, causes no pain, generates no heat, the body’s qi is robust, and no other symptoms appear, yet the flesh lump is indistinguishable from healthy tissue—this is another condition. Under no circumstances should one rashly use needles or blades to harm oneself. If a quack has already used needles, moxibustion, or corrosive medicines to rot the flesh, causing alternating chills and high fever, the proper approach is to harmonize and unblock qi and blood. Add *shengma* to this formula to dispel cold evil, and use wound-closing, scab-forming medicines to stabilize it, reducing it to a mere wart or growth. If the disease itself festers and rots, unavoidably requiring a blade, there is a marvelous preparation that can replace the knife—do not casually reveal it: mix *baifan* and *kupohua* into powder and apply it.\n\nFor intestinal abscesses within the abdomen, take *Shixuan San* alternately with this formula, adding *rendongteng*, which is most effective for internal abscesses. One must carefully assess deficiency and excess—whether to unblock or supplement. For supplementation, use *fuzi*; for unblocking, use *dahuang*. If deficiency and excess are unclear, this formula naturally harmonizes and unblocks, while *Shixuan* inherently supplements internally, preventing other complications.\n\nFor lung abscesses, the first signs are difficulty eating and slight pain in the chest and diaphragm—this is the condition. Immediately examine the pulse and assess deficiency or excess. If deficient, use this formula with *fuzi*, adjusting as needed. If the condition worsens slightly, use *Shixuan San* to supplement internally, and it will resolve. If excess, use this formula with *dahuang* to slightly unblock, allowing the toxic qi to descend—this is optimal. The lung and large intestine are exterior-interior related. If an internal abscess has already formed, combine *Haishang Fang* with this formula, adjusting as needed.\n\nWheezing, coughing, and expectorating pus and blood indicate a lung abscess. If pus exits through the navel in the stool, it is an abdominal abscess.\n\n**Honeysuckle vine and licorice nodes boiled in wine are excellent.**\n\n*End of Volume One of the Immortal-Transmitted Secret External Medicine Formulas*\n\n*Variant Notes:*\n1.

The Ming edition reads \"尖\" (*tip*).\n\n---\n\n**Volume Two of the Immortal-Transmitted Secret External Medicine Formulas**\n*Compiled by Zhao Yizhen, the Original Yang Master of Junyi*\n\n**Category: Warm Medicinal Formulas for Application**\n\n**#3: Harmonizing Immortal Paste (also called Yellow Cloud Paste or Immortal Paste)**\n*Used for conditions where cold and heat are indistinct; may be mixed with tea or wine according to the syndrome.*\n\n- **Sichuan red-barked catalpa** (*chuan zi ke pi*), 5 *liang* in weight, stir-fried (also called *red flesh*)\n  - *Also called* \"internal disperser\"\n- **Red peony root** (*chi shao yao*), 2 *liang*, stir-fried\n- **Pubescent angelica root** (*du huo*), 3 *liang*, stir-fried (do not use the nodes)\n- **Dahurian angelica root** (*bai zhi*), 1 *liang* (do not expose to fire)\n- **Wood wax** (*mu la*), also called *wang jian xiao* or *yang chun xue* (adjust according to need), stir-fried (this is *shi chang pu*, *Acorus tatarinowii*)\n\nGrind the above five ingredients into a fine powder; detailed instructions for use follow.\n\nAll abscesses, deep-rooted ulcers, *liuzhu* (migratory abscesses), and miscellaneous diseases arise from stagnation of *qi* and blood. When exposed to warmth, they live; when exposed to cold, they die. Living, they disperse; dying, they congeal. This formula is warm and balanced.\n\n- **Red-barked catalpa** is the essence of wood; it breaks *qi*, dispels blood, and resolves swelling.\n- **Pubescent angelica root** is the essence of earth; it arrests wind, mobilizes blood, draws out bone toxins, dispels numbness and dampness, and, together with wood wax, breaks stony hardness.\n- **Red peony root** is the essence of fire; it mildly generates blood, relieves pain, and dispels wind.\n- **Wood wax** is the essence of water; it generates blood, relieves pain, resolves swelling, breaks wind, and disperses blood.\n- **Dahurian angelica root** is the essence of metal; it dispels wind, generates flesh, and relieves pain.\n\nWhen blood is generated, it does not die; when blood moves, it flows freely. When flesh is generated, it does not rot; when pain ceases, it does not fester. When wind departs, blood naturally disperses; when *qi* is broken, hardness dissolves, and toxins scatter. With these five agents working in concert, how could the disease fail to be cured?\n\n---\n\nAll diseases manifest in three syndromes, and treatment employs three methods.\n\n- If the disease is extremely hot, double the amounts of red-barked catalpa and wood wax in this formula, and slightly reduce the other three ingredients. It will still disperse, though more slowly.\n- If the disease is extremely cold, slightly increase red peony root and pubescent angelica root; this will activate blood and disperse the condition, though the effect will be somewhat delayed without harming the disease.\n\n---\n\n- If the disease’s heat is overwhelming, do not use wine to mix the medicine. Instead, steep scallions in hot water to prepare a decoction, then mix the medicine and apply it warm. Scallions also disperse *qi*, and blood flows when warmed—hence the use of warm application.\n- Once the disease has slightly abated, return to using wine to mix the medicine. Wine generates blood, and when warmed, blood is further generated. Wine also mobilizes blood, and when warmed, blood flows more freely.\n\n---\n\n- If the sore surface develops blood blisters or small sores, do not use wood wax, as its drying nature may cause discomfort when the medicine is applied. First apply the other four ingredients, then cover with wood wax to encircle and cut off the attacking blood pathways.\n- When applying medicine, always apply it warm. If it dries, moisten it again with the original decoction to keep the medicinal properties damp and steaming, allowing the disease to recede.\n\n---\n\n- If, when using the standard formula, the black halo around the sore does not recede and the sore’s opening lacks blood color, it indicates the patient has previously used excessive cold medicine. Do not immediately apply *Yulong* (Jade Dragon), as the flesh is not yet dead, and the strong medicinal force may increase suffering. Instead, add cinnamon bark (*rou gui*) and Chinese angelica (*dang gui*) to this formula to revive the dead blood. The black halo will naturally recede, and efficacy will appear. Once the blood returns, discontinue the additions and use only the standard formula to achieve results.\n\n---\n\n- If pain persists when using the standard formula, dissolve frankincense (*ru xiang*) and myrrh (*mo yao*) in wine over a fire, then mix this wine with the medicine and apply it warm to relieve pain.\n\n---\n\n- For *liuzhu* (migratory abscesses) where the sinews fail to extend, add frankincense to this formula and apply it; its nature promotes sinew extension.\n\n---\n\n- If the sore’s opening develops protruding red flesh, there are three possible causes: (1) exposure to water, (2) exposure to wind, or (3) inversion of the wound edges after a knife incision.\n  - Add a small amount of *arisaema* (*nan xing*) to dispel wind, and mix the medicine with ginger juice and wine.\n  - If it does not resolve, the condition likely arose because an unskilled physician pressed out the pus core too forcefully and then applied cold medicine to the skin, causing this outcome. If hot medicine is applied, it will further rot the flesh. There is a secret method for this: apply a powder of alum (*bai fan*) and dried ginger (*ku po xiao*), then dust with sulfur (*liu huang*). Internally, administer *Rong Wei Jia Dui Jin Yin* (Nourishing and Defending Decoction with Paired Metal), and externally apply *Chong He* (Harmonizing Immortal Paste).\n\n---\n\n- If the disease’s heat is severe, do not immediately use cold medicine. Excessive heat causes *qi* and blood to congest, and extreme cold causes blood to retreat incompletely, congealing due to cold. Thus, use a balanced combination of warm and cool. Add *Dui Ting Hong Bao Dan* (Balanced Treasure Elixir) to this formula, mix with scallion decoction, and apply.\n\n---\n\nThis formula is the foremost medicine for *fabei* (carbuncles of the back) and *liuzhu* (migratory abscesses). Scholars should master its flexible application, aligning internal and external treatments so that the disease remains within their grasp.\n\nHowever, severe *fabei* is a matter of life and death, and only this formula offers the most stable and reliable efficacy from beginning to end, with no risk of deterioration. In mild cases, even folk healers may achieve results, though complications and harmful consequences may arise. This is because *fabei* arising from *yin* cannot be treated by folk healers. How could any other formula compare to this one, which treats both *yin* and *yang* conditions and seizes the divine power of creation?\n\nAs for *liuzhu*, though it is not fatal, nine out of ten cases result in disability. Prolonged disability leads to death, and even if a physician can cure it, recovery typically takes half a year to a full year.\n\nThis occurs in but one out of a hundred cases—yet the body remains feeble and impaired. Only the immortal formulas of our lineage, with their extraordinary and swift efficacy, never fail even once, possessing the power to snatch life from the jaws of death—effects beyond full description in words.\n\nNow, *liuzhu* arises from residual toxins of *shanghan*. When the exterior has not fully resolved, these toxins lodge in the channels and network vessels. If qi and blood become uneven, they transform into *heat-liuzhu*. Those cases physicians can cure are the heat type. Heat diseases rarely involve excessive exterior dispersion, but when qi and blood are depleted, residual toxins flow into the interstices—whether loose or tight—and become *cold-liuzhu*. These are the cases physicians find difficult to cure.\n\nCold diseases are far more common. Thus, when *shanghan*’s exterior has not fully resolved, it is not merely a heat pattern; its residual toxins often manifest as cold patterns, leading to cold paralysis. When rooted in kidney deficiency, it produces *guju*. Cold causes qi to stagnate further and blood to congeal, resulting only in swelling without suppuration. If a physician administers cold formulas, they \"cool what is already cold,\" and *yin* dies within *yin*, leading only to putrefying flesh, bone-bound toxins, and *guying*—ultimately, disability. Thus, *guying* is the failed outcome of *liuzhu*.\n\nYet it is said: *guying* is not the fault of *liuzhu*, but the error of physicians who prescribe cooling remedies. For *liu* means movement, and *zhu* means stagnation.\n\nWhen qi flows and stagnates, blood congeals where it settles. Qi is yang; blood is yin. When yang moves, yin follows; when qi circulates, blood flows. The reason we can shift *liuzhu* to another location and disperse it lies precisely in its capacity for movement. Where movement occurs, displacement follows—once yang has moved and stirred, how can yin remain stagnant and not follow? Thus, we employ *duhuo* to guide it, for its nature is to stir and agitate both qi and blood. Once guided into motion, yin and yang harmonize, preventing suppuration and dispersing the condition at the new site—an inevitable outcome.\n\nWhen *liuzhu* arises in critical areas such as the back, shoulders, waist, or legs, apply this formula thickly to the affected site. Then, use *duhuo* powder alone, mixed with wine and applied hot along a single path, leading to its endpoint where *yulong* is applied—this is the method of displacement. It directs the blood and qi to another location, causing them to gather and suppurate in a non-critical area. Alternatively, it may be resolved entirely. If pus has already formed, displacement is no longer possible; instead, apply this medicine urgently to draw out the toxins and prevent the development of *guying*. When incompetent physicians use cooling remedies or improperly employ needles and blades, *guying* forms—a condition not curable by medicine, requiring only that the decayed bone be expelled before healing can occur. If one hesitates to use needles or blades to extract it, apply *yulong*; the treatment method follows later. If the primary bone is expelled, no remedy exists; if a secondary bone is expelled, recovery is possible.\n\nOne formula uses *baizhi* and *zijinpi*, mixed with wine, to internally resolve early-stage abscesses—named *Yisheng Gao*. Another formula employs *chishaoyao*, *mola*, and *zishengpi* as a binding medicine—named *Sansheng Gao*. Another method treats adults or children who have accidentally severed their tongues with a blade, where the tongue hangs but remains partially attached: wrap the tongue in the soft inner membrane of a chicken egg, apply *Poxue Dan* mixed with honey to the root of the tongue to stanch bleeding, then blend honey and wax to an appropriate consistency, incorporating this primary formula. Apply it to the chicken membrane, as its softness and thinness allow the medicine to penetrate. If the tongue remains in the mouth, frequently reapply the melted mixture. After three days, the tongue will reattach, at which point the chicken membrane may be removed, and only the honey-wax mixture with the medicine need be applied diligently. Full recovery occurs within seven days. Those who study this will understand the marvelous applications of adaptable methods, which do not rely solely on the transmission of a teacher. If rapid results are not achieved, combine with *jinchuang* remedies for even greater efficacy.\n\nFor abscesses that have not yet formed pus, do not immediately apply *Hongbao Dan* to the head of the swelling, lest the cold medicine freeze the blood, preventing resolution and suppuration while causing flesh to rot. Instead, apply this formula. If the swelling does not resolve and suppuration is desired, apply *yulong* to the head of the abscess to dry it. Then, place this primary formula beneath the *yulong*, encircling the abscess with *Hongbao Dan* to block the influx of fresh blood. If the condition has not been excessively chilled by cooling medicines, there is no need to apply this formula beneath the *yulong*; simply encircle the abscess with *Hongbao Dan*.\n\nWhen treating severe or deteriorating conditions, if *yulong* cannot yet be applied, use this formula alone for stability and to spare the patient distress. For nascent *fabei* that has not yet formed, apply *zijinpi* powder mixed with wine as a binding agent to naturally constrict and prevent spreading. Internally, administer *Zuomu Yinzi*—an excellent remedy for the impoverished.\n\nAdding two-thirds parts *nanxing* and *caowu* to this formula, mixed with hot wine and applied, can cause any abscess to suppurate painlessly. Using *yulong* alone requires *Hongbao Dan* to encircle it, but this method is superior. For rabid dog bites, apply *zijiao* mixed with brown sugar, leaving the wound open. Use *jindan* to reduce swelling, and place chewed apricot kernels in the wound to draw out toxins.\n\nAnother method combines equal parts *nanxing* and *caowu* with this formula, mixed with hot wine and applied, to treat long-standing injuries—most effective. For soft nodules in children, add *junjiang* to this formula, mixed with wine and applied. If applied at the onset, this formula alone, mixed with wine, will suffice until pus forms. At the initial stage, applying *zijinpi* and *mola* mixed with wine can ensure resolution; under no circumstances should *Hongbao Dan* be used.\n\n*Biaoju* arises from heart-fire and heat toxins, manifesting in the five centers with unbearable pain. Its appearance resembles blistering sores with red blood, and though its external form is small, the internal heat toxin is severe. If located in the heart or diaphragm, it is difficult to treat; if in the palms or soles, it may be cured. However, treatment must be prompt—delay or localization in the heart or diaphragm leads to putrefied, pulverized flesh, beyond even the aid of immortals. For this condition in the palm, apply *Hongbao Dan* in a ring around the palm to block the blood, then use *Zhonghe* at the center, leaving an opening to complete the treatment. For the sole, apply *Hongbao* along the foot’s meridian at the *jiaogu* bone, encircling an area one to two *cun* in length, then use *Chonghe* as before to conclude. *Xianchuan Waike Mifang*, Scroll Two, concludes.\n\n**Scroll Three of *Xianchuan Waike Mifang*\nCompiled by Zhao Yizhen of Junyi Yuanchang**\n\n**Section Four: Topical Applications of Heating Medicines**\n\n**Huanyang Yulong Ointment (Yang-Returning Jade Dragon Ointment), Hot in Nature**\n- *Cao Wu* (wild aconite), 3 *liang*, stir-fried\n- *Nan Xing* (arisaema), 1 *liang*, roasted\n- *Jun Jiang* (ginger), 2 *liang*, roasted\n- *Bai Zhi* (angelica), 1 *liang*, unheated\n- *Chi Shao Yao* (red peony), 1 *liang*, stir-fried\n- *Rou Gui* (cassia bark), ½ *liang*, unheated\n\nThis formula treats yin-type *fabei* (back carbuncles), cold *liuzhu* (flowing phlegm), *guzhui* wind (drumstick wind), chronic traumatic pain, cold impediment with wind-damp, all cases of cold leg qi with swelling but no redness, cold pain without swelling, numbness of the feet, and cold blood wind in women—it is the foremost medicine for all yin patterns.\n\n**Usage** is detailed below; apply mixed with warm wine.\n\nThough miscellaneous diseases manifest in the skin, hands, or feet, their root necessarily lies in the five viscera and six bowels. The blood vessels and meridians of the viscera and bowels circulate throughout the body day and night, completing their cycle without cease. When one viscus is afflicted, the disease must appear where its pulse and qi traverse, corresponding to the yin-yang divisions of the hands and feet. Diseases may be cold or hot: hot ones are easily treated, while cold ones are difficult to cure. Cold necessarily arises from deficiency of original yang in the viscera and bowels, allowing wind evil to exploit the gap and enter. When qi and blood become uneven, the evil travels from the meridians to lodge in the skin, obstructing the smooth flow of the vessels. The more cold congeals, the more it accumulates without dispersing. If incompetent physicians then apply freezing agents, attacking both internally and externally, the condition rarely fails to become critical. The scholar must observe the external signs while examining their internal correspondences; when exterior and interior align, not a single case will be missed.\n\nThis medicine contains *Jun Jiang* and *Rou Gui*, sufficient to warm the blood and generate blood. Yet once generated and warmed, if it cannot disperse, it may instead cause harm. Thus, *Cao Wu* and *Nan Xing* are included to break evil qi, expel wind toxin, enliven dead flesh, relieve bone pain, dissolve lumps, and summon yang qi. *Chi Shao* and *Bai Zhi* further disperse stagnant blood, alleviate suffering, and regenerate flesh. Combined with wine to circulate the medicine’s nature and disperse qi and blood, even the most severe cold patterns will be cured—like kindling flame from cold ashes or reviving spring in withered wood.\n\nGenerally, cold diseases cause yin decay of flesh, rendering it insensate to pain or itching. If pain is present, it often clings to the bone; left untreated, the cold root penetrates the marrow, beyond the reach of ordinary medicines. Only this formula can thoroughly expel yin toxin, restore yang qi, relieve bone pain, and halt diseases of the flesh and skin—this much is evident. However, its use must be measured; excess should be avoided to achieve perfection. Variations in treatment are outlined below.\n\n1. **Yin-type *fabei* (back carbuncle)**, or cases misdiagnosed with cold medicines, or originally yang-type *fabei* mistakenly treated with cold medicines—where yang transforms into yin, the entire back blackens and decays. Apply *Hongbao Dan* around the healthy flesh at the edges to contain the blood, then apply this ointment to the center. After one night, yang qi will return, and blackened areas will turn red. Once redness and vitality are observed, discontinue this medicine and use *Chonghe* to complete the treatment. If ineffective and suppuration begins, add *Nan Xing* and *Cao Wu* to *Chonghe* for use. If yang has returned and blackness has turned red, but a single blackened, decayed spot remains that refuses to redden—this indicates dead blood. Apply *Pu Xiao* (mirabilite) and *Ming Fan* (alum), or alternatively, *Bai Dingxiang* (sparrow droppings), *Peng Sha* (borax), and *Ru Xiang* (frankincense), mixed with saliva. Draw a circle at the junction of black and red, then cover with *Chonghe*. By the next morning, the blackened flesh will detach as if cut away. Wash the area, apply flesh-generating medicine, and close the wound to complete treatment.\n\n2. **Cold *liuzhu* (flowing phlegm)** often clings to the bone, with hardened flesh that does not resolve, cold bone pain, and contracted sinews that cannot extend. Light use of the knife or needle yields no pus or blood—only thin, watery discharge or static blood. Apply this ointment. If slightly delayed, mix equal parts *Jun Jiang*, *Bai Zhi*, *Rou Gui*, and *Cao Wu* with warm wine for application. Once bone cold is dispelled and pain ceases, qi will warm and harmonize, sinews will naturally extend, and hardened flesh will resolve. However, treating *liuzhu* cannot omit *Mu La* (litsea), as its nature excels at breaking stagnant qi and dispersing hard swellings. Yet it must not be used in excess, for it can neutralize the medicine’s nature—this pattern fundamentally relies on warming medicines.\n\n3. **Guzhui wind (drumstick wind)** arises from internal dampness, residual toxin from cold damage, complications of *liuzhu*, or wind-damp vacuity impediment. This condition has three presentations:\n   - The knees knock together when walking, with trembling steps and slight swelling along the knee’s *jinggu* bone.\n   - The junction of the knee’s *jinggu* bone swells to the size of a mallet, the thigh flesh wastes away, and the skin contracts around the bone.\n   - The upper leg swells while the lower leg cools and wastes.\n\n   The feet and knees pertain to the liver. When the liver meridian is invaded by wind, cold, and damp qi, blood and vessels fail to flow, giving rise to this condition. The knees become cold and obstructed, congealing and stagnating. The lower leg’s vessels have outflow but no return, growing ever thinner, colder, and more contracted. The upper leg’s vessels accumulate without dispersion, swelling while the flesh wastes and grows hotter. If originating from *liuzhu*, the flesh may become numb and decay; decay leads to cold toxin corroding the bone. Once the bone rots and emerges, even immortals have no remedy.\n\nBefore ulceration occurs and the flesh has not yet necrosed, promptly apply this medicinal paste—mixed with hot wine—to the upper leg at the knee and *jinggu* bone to arrest bone pain and restore yang qi. Then apply *Chonghe* ointment to the cold lower leg to guide the blood and qi, promoting downward flow and unblocking the vessels. Apply this formula again to the junction of the meridian and bone to connect the guided vessels and disperse the accumulated yin qi. Internally, administer *Zhuifeng* pills with double the usual dose of frankincense to relax the sinews, following the prescribed method—none will fail to recover.\n\nIf the patient wishes to go out, one may use *Wuji* powder with added ginger, cinnamon, angelica, and *bai zhi*, further augmented with large Sichuan aconite, *niu xi*, areca nut, and chaenomeles, mixed with tea or wine. For men or women suffering long from cold impediment, blood wind, numbness, or inability to move the limbs, fill a cotton pouch with this medicine and bind it lengthwise around the painful area, securing it with a silk bag. This medicine relieves bone pain; when applied to the flesh, the skin will feel as if ants are crawling—this signals its efficacy. For impediment, add equal parts *ding pi*, evodia fruit, myrrh, and large Sichuan aconite, then combine with *Zhuifeng* pills for simultaneous internal and external treatment—its curative power is divine.\n\nFor unbearable wind-leg pain, take *Zhuifeng* pills internally and apply this formula externally, mixed with raw flour and ginger juice as a hot poultice. For immediate relief, add frankincense and myrrh, dissolving them in wine for application—this is most effective.\n\nFor long-standing injuries penetrating the bone—caused by falls, blows, or fractures where blood was not properly circulated—stagnant blood lingers at the site of injury. Over time, it adheres like chicken lungs to ribs, or in milder cases, like moss clinging to stone. In youth, when blood and qi are warm and harmonious, one may scarcely notice; but in old age, when blood declines, exposure to wind, cold, rain, or dampness triggers the ailment. Apply this formula mixed with hot wine, and internally administer *Sousun Xuntong* pills—combined internal and external treatment is most effective. However, in those with deficient blood and qi, if the illness resides between the chest, ribs, waist, or back, it is called \"unremoved grime,\" which may transform into consumptive blood stasis. Regardless of age or duration—whether affecting the entire body or just a fist or elbow—the treatment is the same. Such conditions are deeply rooted; they cannot be cured with a single dose but require months or years to stabilize. Those not yet consumptive are easily healed; once consumptive, they are difficult.\n\nOne method uses *nan xing* and *cao wu* with a small amount of cinnamon to dispel blackened necrosis and purulent decay—this is called *Xiao Yulong*. For *shi yong* (stone-like carbuncles), apply this formula mixed with hot wine, then encircle the area with *Hongbao* paste to await suppuration and rupture.\n\nFor women with breast abscesses: these often arise after weaning when milk fails to recede; or when milk is abundant but the infant nurses little, causing stagnation and clumping; or when menstruation is irregular and flows counter to its proper course; or when pathogenic qi becomes internally constrained, later forming swollen abscesses. At the initial onset, *do not* use cooling medicines to freeze it. The breast is formed from transformed blood; if it cannot drain, it hardens into swollen lumps. Its nature is inherently cold—if chilled by cold medicines, it congeals and fails to disperse. Over time, external blood unable to transform into milk generates heat and pain, steaming the breast lumps into pus. The suffering is extraordinary, and the abscess will not cease until it rots completely. Thus, those who recover from breast abscesses lose their milk. The breast’s nature is most cold; when further obstructed by cooling agents, yin putrefaction is inevitable. However, cooling medicines are not entirely without use—they are beneficial *after* ulceration. At the initial onset, apply this formula with *nan xing*, mixed evenly with equal parts ginger juice and wine, as a hot poultice to dissolve it internally. For faster results, add *cao wu*—its potent nature can break up malignant masses, expel cold and heat, dissolve when cold, and suppurate when hot. If an abscess has already formed, use *Chonghe* as usual, or add *cao wu* and *nan xing*. After rupture, observe the cause: if from cold, use *Chonghe* to complete the cure; if from heat, use *Hongbao* to generate flesh. Additionally, apply frankincense and myrrh to relieve pain and reduce suffering. For internal medicine, use *Gualou* powder, adjusting for deficiency or excess with *Tongshun* powder or *Shixuan* decoction in alternation.\n\nFor multiple openings, it is called *ru fa* (breast effusion); for hardened breast lumps, *ru shi* (breast stone); for swelling at the nipple, *chui ru* (blown breast); for abscesses below the breast pouch, *ru lou* (breast fistula)—the latter is difficult to treat due to the pendulous flesh where blood readily pools. A single opening is *ru yong* (breast abscess); for those over fifty, there is no treatment. However, *laoren ru jie* (elderly breast nodes) may still be treated, as abscesses form on the pendulous flesh, while nodes appear near the armpit.\n\nFor chronic phlegm deviating from its path, causing swollen abscesses without pus, apply this medicine to induce a response—the illness will discharge laterally, allowing for a better outcome. Otherwise, if original yang is depleted, this becomes a critical condition. For such critical depletion of original yang, urgently apply *Quanti Yulong* to draw out pus, and take *Tongshun* powder with added platycodon, pinellia, tangkuei, and cinnamon. If the illness is red, lively, and rapidly heating, *Danggui Chonghe* is best—*never* mistakenly administer freezing agents. This formula only draws toxins to form pus; discontinue once the illness recedes, and do not overuse. Combining it with *Daomai Shenji* is even more effective, as recorded in *Waike Jingyao*.\n\nFor abdominal abscesses, nine out of ten cases are fatal. The stomach pertains to yin, and external cold envelops internal heat. When qi and blood converge, they seek heat and avoid cold, often forming internal abscesses that cannot manifest externally. Occasionally, a faint shadow may appear, but if touched by cold medicines or cooling agents, even immortals cannot apply their skill—how can physicians not be cautious?\n\nFor any case presenting these symptoms, if at the onset there is abdominal pain and, upon pressing with the hand, the pain shifts and moves, this indicates a *qi* mass. If the root remains fixed and there is slight redness and swelling externally, it signifies an internal abscess. Immediately apply this formula to draw out the toxic *qi* and transform it into an external abscess, then complete the treatment with *Chonghe*. Internally, administer *Tongshun* powder with added *rendongteng*, following the method described previously. If the abscess naturally manifests externally, there is no need for this formula—simply use *Chonghe*, and avoid reckless use of needles or blades. Should the abscess be incised with metal instruments, causing the wound to gape, apply *Yulong* to the head of the abscess and encircle the edges with *Chonghe*, allowing it to rupture naturally. If the pus does not drain swiftly, mix three parts *Hongbao* with seven parts ginger juice and tea, then apply to facilitate complete drainage. Internally, use *Shixuan* to nourish and regenerate flesh, while externally, continue with *Chonghe* to conclude the treatment. This condition involves excess yin and deficient yang, inflicting severe harm upon the patient. As recovery nears, double the dosage of internal tonics to restore *qi* and blood, thereby promoting easier healing; otherwise, the abscess may recede only to swell again, and the wound may fail to close. Even after stabilization, it is advisable to take internal tonics with added *fuzi* to prevent *qi* deficiency from impeding recovery.\n\nIn cold-type cases, it is especially important to administer *fuzi* before the abscess ruptures; however, after rupture, avoid hasty astringent or wound-sealing medicines, lest residual toxins remain trapped. With proper medicinal treatment, the wound will close naturally. If the internal abscess has already formed and cannot be drawn outward, apply *Chonghe* externally to warm and promote suppuration, allowing the pus to discharge from the viscera rather than causing internal putrefaction. Life and death hinge entirely on the efficacy of the medicinal treatment—refer to the methods outlined earlier. Most critically, avoid toxic foods, as their consumption will provoke recurrence, making the condition refractory and difficult to cure.\n\nFor pregnant women afflicted with this condition, the approach differs: internally, administer *Zisu* decoction to calm the fetus, and avoid other medicines unless absolutely necessary. If the condition arises near term, the child and pus will descend together; if the pregnancy is still distant, the pus will discharge through the large intestine. If detected early, medicinal treatment alone may resolve it. Should the abscess manifest externally, the condition will necessarily involve heat, and *Chonghe* alone should be used to conclude the treatment—though its application must be carefully weighed against the severity of the case to avoid error.\n\n*Concluding Volume Three of the Immortal’s Transmitted External and Secret Formulas*\n*Beginning Volume Four of the Immortal’s Transmitted External and Secret Formulas*\n\n**Hongbao Elixir (also known as Golden Elixir, Inch of Gold, Four Yellows Powder, One Yellow Powder, Blood-Breaking Elixir, or Yellow Medicine)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- *Tianhuafen* (Trichosanthes root) – 3 *liang*\n- *Jianghuang* (turmeric) – 1 *liang*\n- *Baizhi* (angelica root) – 1 *liang*\n- *Chishaoyao* (red peony root) – 2 *liang*\n\nGrind into a fine powder. Use tea, wine, or water as a vehicle, applying topically for all heat-type abscesses, swellings, and metal-inflicted wounds.\n\nThis medicine is purely cooling. It can transform blood into water yet also cause blood stasis; it cools the flesh and promotes flesh regeneration while removing dead or rotting tissue. It breaks up blood and reduces swelling, yet may also cause qi to stagnate and rise. It can stop pain or induce it, close pus or expel it—its effects are contradictory. The formula’s nature is simple: its efficacy is slight when applied to cold conditions but pronounced when used for heat. Thus, it must not be used lightly for non-severe yang patterns, lest it congeal cold and complicate treatment.\n\nFor metal-inflicted wounds with bleeding, nothing surpasses this remedy—it is the foremost medicine. In other cases, it serves merely as an auxiliary to the two preceding formulas. Discernment is paramount.\n\nGenerally, these three medicines may:\n- Combine forces for a shared effect,\n- Operate independently with specialized authority,\n- Divide duties in coordinated roles,\n- Encircle and attack in concert,\n- Lend mutual reinforcement,\n- Engage in stalwart resistance,\n- Serve as the vanguard with orthodox tactics or achieve victory through unorthodox means,\n- Or lead with unorthodox tactics and secure triumph with orthodox methods.\n\nTheir ingenuity and precision mirror the art of warfare. Yet as troops follow the seal and generals obey commands, success hinges on the practitioner. Without one who understands principles and adapts to change, what can be said of mastery?\n\n**Methods of Application:**\n\n1. For severe heat in the condition, mix with hot tea and apply.\n   For milder heat, use wine as the vehicle.\n   To draw out pus, blend with three parts ginger juice and seven parts tea. Why? This medicine is profoundly cooling and causes blood to recede, while ginger juice, being warm, draws blood forward. Thus, blood retreats and is then propelled, creating a dynamic tension that matures the pus and prompts its discharge.\n\n2. If the wound’s edges harden and fail to resolve, the area has been assailed by wind. Add *duhuo* (angelica pubescens) to this formula and mix with hot wine. If improvement remains elusive, the wind-toxin has penetrated deeply, and the flesh has hardened. Add *zijingpi* (bark of the redbud tree), and resolution is assured.\n\n3. This formula excels at treating metal wounds and heat-type red swellings, staunching the root of bleeding to prevent redness and protrusion. However, it must not be used lightly for carbuncles or deep abscesses, lest the toxin fail to disperse and instead penetrate inward. If it lodges in the bone, it may form a bone abscess; in the throat, it may gather as toxic qi; in the chest or back, it may rot the viscera; in the abdomen, it may become an internal abscess—leading to irreversible harm. One must exercise utmost caution. For such cases, *Chonghe* and *Yulong* should be used according to the method and symptoms.\n\n4. For the young with robust blood or the elderly with debilitated blood, if bleeding cannot be stopped, the patient may perish as blood is exhausted. If the wound is on the limbs, apply the medicine mixed with tea to the area a *chi* above and below the injury. If on the chest, back, waist, or abdomen, cover the entire body to block the blood’s path. Then administer *Duanxue* powder (fivefold the usual dose) or the *Divine Military Formula* (see later) to the wound, and healing will follow.\n\n5. For severe metal wounds where sinews are severed, pulses cut off, and blood lost to the point of death, to staunch bleeding, first bind the arm with a cord or silk sash. Then apply this formula mixed with tea to the arm to block the blood’s path. Next, use the *Duanxue* medicine on the wound. Avoid internal tonics such as *Siwu* decoction, as they may induce vomiting or, in severe cases, cause facial distortion, restlessness, fever, and tetanus. Instead, administer the *Duijin* drink with *Chuanxiong* and *Baizhi*, decocted with ginger and jujube, to stabilize the condition, followed by gradual blood supplementation. If tetanus develops, use tetanus-specific medicines such as *Gegen* decoction (see later). For the wound, apply the *Military Formula* with nine-lobed turtle shell (stir-fried with suet and ground).\n\n6. For metal wounds on the head or face where bleeding does not cease, urgently apply this formula mixed with tea in a circular band around the neck to block the blood. Also apply it to the wound’s edges, and use the *Military Formula* on the wound itself. Severe cases will resolve in ten days; mild ones in three.\n\n7. For metal wounds exposed to water, where the flesh turns white and blooms like a flower, mix this formula with scallion juice and apply to both sides of the wound, then warm gently with fire. Alternatively, fumigate with smoke from early-season rice stalks. If water exudes from the wound, healing will follow. If no water appears, wind has invaded—apply *nanxing* (arisaema) mixed with tea, and the condition will resolve. Then use the *Military Formula* on the wound.\n\n8. For women postpartum or during menopause with reversed blood flow, where the heart cannot govern and blood is vomited, or epistaxis or tongue bleeding occurs, apply this formula mixed with well-water or fresh mugwort juice to the neck. The bleeding will cease immediately, after which internal medicine should be given to address the root. For tongue bleeding, if blood blisters form and refill upon bursting, tie a thread around the base of the tongue (do not remove it). Apply the medicine to the neck to block the blood, and internally administer heart-cooling medicines such as *Huangqin* and *Jingjie*. For the tongue, use honey-mixed wound-sealing medicine. Once the blister is lanced and the thread removed, the bleeding will not recur. Follow with heart-cooling medicines: *Siwu* decoction with *Jingjie*, *Bohe*, and *Zhusha*.\n\n9. When applying this formula to hot toxins, if the area dries and pain persists with redness and swelling, mix with egg white for application. This method is wondrous for stubborn heat toxins.\n\nFor scalds and burns, the treatment is the same.\n\nIf injuries from blows or falls occur on the chest or diaphragm, and the medicine fails to promote blood flow downward, mix this medicinal powder with mung bean water and swallow it to induce vomiting, after which the patient will recover.\n\nThere are also cases where, after a fall from a height, blood-flow-promoting medicines fail to take effect, and after several days the patient nears death. This is invariably due to cold weather freezing the blood after administering *Dahuang* and similar medicines, causing the blood to congeal and stagnate. In such cases, mix *Junjiang* powder with hot wine and administer it. Within moments, the blood will flow freely, and the patient will revive. This method relies on the heat of the wine to activate stagnant blood, allowing the previous medicines to take effect.\n\n**Formulas to be Used Together, Section Six**\n\n**Huangfan Pill (also called Humo Powder)**\n- *Mingfan* (raw alum), one *liang*, ground to powder\n- Yellow beeswax\n\nMelt the beeswax over a fire, then remove it and allow it to cool to ninety percent.

Types include *qi ding*, *water-fire ding*, *snake-eye ding*, *stone ding*, *male-female ding*, *rotten ding*, *blood ding*, *axe ding*, *red-thread*, *fish-eye*, *purple-inkstone*, and *hemp-seed ding*. Immediately apply *Circle Yellow Medicine*: take one gallbladder from a male pig slaughtered in the twelfth lunar month, add realgar, Beijing ink, and ginger juice, grind into powder, and place inside the gallbladder. Apply this medicine around the sore to prevent *walking yellow* (systemic infection).\n\nOnce the *original ding* emerges, insert a needle until pain is felt, then stop. Bleeding is harmless. Apply *Immortal Toad Extract* to draw out toxins, then insert *Yellow Medicine* into the sore and cover with *Water-Sinking Plaster* or *Divine Response Plaster*. When the yellow (pus) recedes, the sore will redden and swell. Around the swollen area, use needles to drain toxic yellow fluid.\n\nIf *walking yellow* occurs, observe where the blood vessels lead and use a fire needle to sever them, halting further spread. If the yellow toxin travels and forms a lump, this confirms the infection. Insert thirty to fifty needles into the lump to drain blood and toxins, then apply *Topical Yellow Medicine* to expel the poison.\n\nIf the yellow toxin crosses from left to right or right to left, the condition is difficult to treat and likely fatal. If no blood emerges when needling the yellow area, or if the blood is dark purple or black, the condition is also critical and fatal.\n\nWhen needling to extract yellow toxin, avoid iron needles—use only gold, silver, or copper needles.\n\nAt the first sign of eruption, urgently administer *Pain-Pursuing Life-Snatching Decoction* to dissolve the swelling internally, yielding immediate results. *Flying Dragon Life-Snatching Elixir* may also be used. Later, administer *Toxin-Transforming Swelling-Resolving Supporting Decoction*. All subsequent medicines should induce profuse sweating for efficacy.\n\n**Method for Extracting Toad Venom (*Chan Su*)**\nTake a live toad with scabies, press its brow ridge onto oil paper or fresh mulberry leaves, and collect the secreted *chan su* with a bamboo strip. Scrape it onto the strip and store in a shaded place overnight until dry, then collect for use.\n\n**Toxin-Pursuing Elixir**\nRemoves the head of the *ding*, draws out pus and toxins, and yields immediate results.\n- *Chan su* (dried), 1 *qian* (dissolve in aged wine)\n- Croton seeds, 7 pieces (remove shells, retain oil)\n- Sparrow droppings (*baidingxiang*), 1 *qian* (if unavailable, add croton seeds)\n- Centipede (wine-soaked, baked until yellow)\n- Sal ammoniac, 1 *qian*\n- Realgar, 2 *qian*\n- Calomel, 1 *qian*\n- Cinnabar, 2 *qian* (for coating; yellow lead may substitute)\n\nGrind all into fine powder, mix with wheat flour and water to form pills. If pills do not hold, add wine and flour paste. Shape into wheat-sized pills with pointed ends. Insert into the needle-opened sore, then cover with *Water-Sinking Plaster*. Later, apply plasters and flesh-generating medicines to expel pus, blood, and toxins.\n\nFor black, sunken, or leaking sores with dead or decayed flesh that impedes healing, this medicine also expels toxins, removes necrotic tissue, and promotes new flesh growth, leading to recovery. Use one pill for small sores; increase for larger ones.\n\nFor mild cases, needles are unnecessary. Scratch the sore’s center with a fingernail, place the medicine, and cover with *Water-Sinking Plaster*. The sore will redden and swell, indicating efficacy. Removing decayed flesh is optimal. This method is divinely effective and yields immediate results.\n\n**Water-Sinking Plaster**\nPlace *bletilla* powder in a dish, add water to submerge it, then cover with paper. When applying this plaster, do not use flesh-generating medicines (formulas provided earlier).\n\n**Topical Yellow Medicine**\n- Cicada slough\n- Silkworm (*jiangcan*)\n\n**Alternative Formulas**\n- Loofah leaves with tendrils, scallion whites, Chinese chives\n- Cocklebur roots and shoots (burned to ash), white salt, plum ash, indigo (most effective)\n\nGrind all into fine powder, mix with vinegar, and apply around the sore, leaving the center open to drain toxins. If the medicine dries, reapply vinegar to keep it moist. If the condition does not improve, add the aforementioned *Toxin-Transforming Blood-Dispersing Toxin-Extracting Powder* for immediate results.\n\nFor *ding* sores with sunken centers or persistent pus, use *iron rust* (quantity as needed), grind into fine powder, mix with vinegar, and apply to the sore. The toxin will naturally protrude, and pus will dry immediately, yielding swift results.\n\n**Pain-Pursuing Life-Snatching Decoction (Secret Formula, Rapid Efficacy)**\nDissolves swelling internally.\n- Notopterygium (*qianghuo*)\n- Pubescent angelica (*duhuo*)\n- Green tangerine peel (use more)\n- Saposhnikovia (*fangfeng*) (use more)\n- Coptis (*huanglian*)\n- Red peony (*chishaoyao*)\n- Asarum (*xixin*)\n- Licorice nodes (*gancaojie*)\n- Cicada slough (*chantui*)\n- Silkworm (*jiangcan*)\n- Coptis rhizome (*jiaolian*) (equal parts)\n\nAdd human placenta (*heche*), *ze lan*, and honeysuckle. For pus, add fleeceflower root (*shouwu*), angelica (*baizhi*) (for smooth flow), *qingmuxiang*, rhubarb (*dahuang*), gardenia (*zhizi*), and morning glory seeds (*qianniu*).\n\nFor leg sores, add chaenomeles (*mugua*).\n\nSlice the ingredients. For each dose of 5 *qian*, first take one dose and add a small amount of *ze lan* leaves, 1 *tael* each of honeysuckle and fresh ginger. Pound together, steep in good wine, and administer warm. For those who do not drink, decoct in water.\n\nThen use 1.5 cups each of wine and water, 10 slices of fresh ginger, and decoct until warm. Administer until sweating occurs. As the condition improves, reduce the dosage, then add 2 *qian* of rhubarb and decoct warm. Finally, induce a bowel movement to expel residual toxins.\n\nThough the ingredients may seem unremarkable, this formula is divinely effective and infallible, with repeated proven results. If other symptoms arise, adjust the treatment accordingly for rapid efficacy.\n\nFor vexation and vomiting, add 1 *qian* of licorice nodes and administer with fermented soybean water.\n\nFor hiccups and nausea, administer with a decoction of *ru xiang*, fermented soybean powder, and licorice. Alternatively, swallow *zi he che* and aged ginger with a mouthful of rice vinegar.\n\nFor vexation and vomiting due to latent summerheat, use *Zhu Sha Wu Ling San*. For persistent hiccups, add *mu ding xiang* and *shi lian*; if unrelieved, use *Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San* with *ren shen* and *mu xiang*. For unceasing vomiting with thirst, cold limbs, and summerheat, swallow *Huang Lian Xiang Xu San* with *Xiao Shu Wan*. For cold hands and feet, add *xuan mu gua* and *qian niu*. For vexation, add *mai men dong*, *chi shao yao*, *shan zhi zi*, and *deng cao*. For tidal fever, add *bei chai hu*, *huang qin*, *dan zhu*, and *si mao gen*. For blurred vision, add a small amount of *zhu sha*, *xiong huang*, and *she xiang*. For abdominal distension, add *yi yi ren* and *han shui shi*. For spontaneous diarrhea, add *bai mu*, *bai fu ling*, *rou dou kou*, and *ying su ke*. For unrelenting abdominal pain, add *nan mu xiang* and *ru xiang*. For wheezing and cough, add *zhi mu*, *bei mu*, and a small amount of honey. For headache, add *chuan xiong*, *bai zhi*, and *cong bai*; if unrelieved, grind *luo bo zi*, *chuan xiong*, and *cong bai* into a paste and apply to the *tai yang* points to stop the pain. For copious phlegm, pound fresh *ai* leaf tips with rice vinegar to extract the juice, then swallow to expel phlegm. For sore throat, add *shan dou gen*, *ling xiao gen*, *shan zhi zi*, *dan zhu ye*, *ai ye*, and *deng cao*. For constipation, add ginger-processed *chi shao yao*, *zhi ke*, and *da fu pi*.

For nosebleed, add *ye hong hua*, *di huang*, *ou jie*, and fresh ginger peel. For non-painful sores that do not rise, apply three cones of moxa; if still no pain, the condition is incurable. For *gu zheng*, add *si mao gen*. For pulselessness, administer *Er Shi Si Wei Liu Qi Yin*.\n\nThe secret formula *Jin Ye Su Xiao Nei Xiao* ensures rapid efficacy for a lifetime. *Fei Long Duo Ming Dan* is specifically for *ding* sores, carbuncles of the back, brain abscesses, breast abscesses, *fu gu ju*, and all headless swellings. For such malignant sores, one dose will bring a head to headless swellings, induce pain in painless ones, and immediately cure those already formed. This is the supreme treasure among remedies for critical conditions—one dose can save a life in peril, with infallible results. A closely guarded family secret, its divine speed and efficacy are unmatched. Never lightly disclosed, it remains a lifelong treasure.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- *Chan su*: 2 *qian* (if dried, dissolve in aged wine)\n- *Xue jie*: 1 *qian*\n- *Ru xiang*: 2 *qian*\n- *Mo yao*: 2 *qian*\n- *Xiong huang*: 3 *qian*\n- *Qing fen*: 0.5 *qian*\n- *Dan fan*: 1 *qian*\n- *She xiang*: 0.5 *qian*\n- *Tong lv*: 2 *qian*\n- *Han shui shi*: 1 *qian*\n- *Zhu sha*: 1 *qian* (for coating)\n- *Nao zi*: 0.5 *qian* (optional)\n- *Hai yang*: 21 (land snails, used with shells)\n- *Tian long*: 1 (soaked in *ji* water, roasted until yellow, head and feet removed)\n\nGrind all into fine powder, then grind the *hai yang* into a paste and mix with the powder to form pills the size of mung beans. If the pills do not hold, add wine and wheat flour paste to bind. For each dose, take two pills. First, have the patient chew a 3-inch piece of *cong bai* until pulpy, then spit it into their palm (left for men, right for women). Wrap the pills in the *cong bai* pulp and swallow with 3–4 cups of unadulterated hot wine. Have the patient rest in a wind-free place, covered with clothing. After the time it takes to walk five *li*, administer several more cups of hot wine to reinforce the medicine’s power. The treatment is complete when profuse sweating occurs. For mild cases, two pills will suffice; if no sweat appears, take two more. For severe cases lasting three to five days, take two more pills to cure. If a *ding* sore has spread to the heart (*zou huang*), it is difficult to treat; if cold sweat appears, the patient will die. If the patient cannot chew *cong bai*, grind it and wrap the pills inside, then swallow with hot wine. For sores on the upper body, take after meals; for sores on the lower body, take before meals.\n\nAfter taking this medicine, avoid cold water, cucumbers, eggplants, oil, pork offal, fish, meat, damp noodles, and all foods that provoke wind or sores. Strictly avoid contact with women who have washed or changed clothes worn by those with *hu chou*. This remedy is infallible and revives the dying.\n\n**Verse:**\n*Xue jie*, *chan su*, *qing fen*,\n*Xiong huang*, *tong lv*, *zhu sha* blend,\n*Dan fan*, *han shui*, *she xiang* add,\n*San qi*, *hai yang* ground to mend.\nFor *ding* sores and malignant poisons,\nBrain abscesses, carbuncles—none it spares.\nTwo pills the size of mung beans take,\nChewed with *cong bai*, wine to partake.\nCover with clothes till sweat does flow,\nA soul snatched from death—its fame aglow.\nA divine elixir passed to mortal hands,\n*Duo Ming Jin Dan*—priceless, grand.\n\nFor *ding* sores, abscesses, and toxic swellings, this formula ensures internal resolution, transforming toxins into black fluid expelled through urine, with infallible results.

For each dose, take seven, eight, or nine pills, accompanied by half a *ba dou* grain ground in cold plain water and swallowed. To expel phlegm, decoct *sang bai pi* (mulberry root bark) and *xing ren* (apricot kernel) and swallow the pills with the cold decoction—this will induce purgation.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\nGrind *da ji* into powder. For each dose, take three to four *qian*, mixed with tea infusion and swallowed—this will induce purgation.\n\n**Another Formula for Dispelling Accumulations**\n- *Jiang zi* (croton seeds): 21 grains\n- *Mu xiang* (costus root): equal portion\n- *Ding xiang* (clove): equal portion\n- *Tao ren* (peach kernel): equal portion\n\nGrind into fine powder, form into pills the size of mung beans using wheat-flour paste, and swallow with warm plain water. The purgative effect will follow.\n\n**Jiang Zi Pills**\n- *Jiang zi*: 1 *liang*\n- *Dou chi* (fermented soybean): 1 *liang*\n\nGrind into fine powder, form into pills using wheat-flour paste. For each dose, take seven or nine pills with plain water. Avoid hot liquids or foods; afterward, consume warm rice porridge or rice water to restore strength.\n\n**Ba Huang Plaster**\nUse *chan su* (toad venom) and finely sifted wheat flour to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Place one pill beneath the tongue—yellow discharge will immediately appear.\n\n**Bai Er San (Hundred-Two Powder), also called Heart-Protecting Powder**\nFor treating furuncles with restlessness, loss of limb control, or manic episodes—administer urgently.\n- *Gan cao jie* (licorice root nodes)\n- *Lü dou fen* (mung bean powder)\n- *Zhu sha* (cinnabar): equal portions\n\nGrind into fine powder.

Hold in the mouth and swallow gradually—the furuncle will rupture. **Avoid using iron utensils.**\n\n*Xian Chuan Wai Ke Mi Fang*, Scroll Six, concludes.\n\n**Proven Remedies:** (The Ming printed edition reads \"Methods.\")\n*Xian Chuan Wai Ke Mi Fang*, Scroll Seven\nCompiled by Zhao Yizhen of Junyi, the Original Yang Master\n\nFor the treatment of scrofula (*luǒlì*), regardless of its chronicity, first apply a constrictive bandage to encircle the sore. Then, use moxa fire to cauterize from the lower part upward—once a blister forms, proceed sequentially until reaching the \"mother\" lesion, where the treatment ceases. For each blister, place a slice of garlic and apply five to seven cones of moxa. After cauterizing each lesion, immediately apply a medicated plaster, changing it daily for immediate efficacy.\n\n**Secret-Transmitted Medicated Plaster**\n- *Zhen lǜ fěn* (true chlorite schist): 2.5 *liǎng*, stir-fried in a copper pan until yellow and desiccated\n- *Rǔ xiāng* (frankincense): 0.5 *liǎng*\n- *Tán xiāng* (sandalwood): 0.5 *liǎng*, baked dry\n- *Xiāng jié* (or *xiāng jié*, dragon’s blood resin): 0.5 *liǎng*\n- *Mò yào* (myrrh): 0.5 *liǎng* (used for pain)\n- *Dǎn fán* (true chalcanthite): 0.5 *liǎng* (discontinue after toxin extraction and tissue regeneration)\n- *Qīng fěn* (calomel): a small amount\n- *Nán shé dǎn* (cobra gall, optional)\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk, usable if broken): omit initially\n\nGrind each into fine powder. For every 0.5 *liǎng* of the above ingredients, use 5 *liǎng* of mung bean powder, mixing with rice vinegar to form a paste. Spread on oil paper and apply. If tissue fails to regenerate, add tissue-regenerating agents to achieve healing.\n\n**Five Fragrances Forsythia Powder**\nTreats all accumulations of heat, scrofula with nodules, abscesses, malignant sores, and boils.\n- *Chén xiāng* (aloeswood)\n- *Lián qiào* (forsythia, stems removed)\n- *Rǔ xiāng* (frankincense)\n- *Shēng má* (black cohosh)\n- *Dà huáng* (rhubarb, steamed for purgation or used raw)\n- *Sāng jì shēng* (mistletoe, or substitute *shēng má*)\n- *Dīng xiāng* (clove, twigs removed)\n- *Shè gān* (belamcanda)\n- *Dú huó* (angelica)\n- *Mù tōng* (akebia)\n- *Qiāng huó* (notopterygium)\n- *Gān cǎo* (licorice)\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk, usable if broken)\n- *Qīng mù xiāng* (costusroot), equal portions\n\nChop the ingredients. For each dose, use 4 *qián* with 2 cups of water, decocting to 80% volume. Take warm after meals until malignant toxins are purged. An alternate formula adds raw *huáng qí* (astragalus).\n\nThis decoction may include bamboo sap and *máng xiāo* (mirabilite), adjusting quantities based on heat severity for optimal efficacy. Use the dregs to prepare a wash for immediate healing of sores.\n\n**Instant-Efficacy Powder for Scrofula** (also called Six-One Powder or Beneficial Origin Powder)\nFor early-stage scrofula, this remedy brings immediate relief.\n- *Huá shí* (talc): 1 *liǎng*\n- *Gān cǎo* (licorice): 2 *qián*\n\nFirst, take 1.5 *qián* of the powder per dose, mixed with rice water. Administer one dose before sleep and another at midnight.\n\n**Alternate Formula**\n- *Jīng jiè suì* (schizonepeta spikes): 4 *qián*\n- *Jiāng cán* (silkworm): 4 *qián*\n- *Hēi qiān niú* (black cowherb): 4 *qián*\n- *Bān máo* (blister beetles): 28, heads, legs, and wings removed, stir-fried with glutinous rice until golden (discard beetles, retain rice)\n\nGrind all into fine powder. Take 1 *qián* per dose at dawn with warm wine, expelling malignant toxins via urine. If no toxins appear, take another dose the next day; if still ineffective, on the third day at dawn, first consume thin glutinous rice porridge, then take another dose, followed by 1 *qián* of *hǔ pò* (amber) powder mixed with rush pith decoction. Success is marked by the expulsion of toxins in urine, ensuring no recurrence. For unrelenting abdominal pain or excessive toxin discharge, consume cold tea. If pain persists, grind *fáng fēng* (saposhnikovia) in water to relieve it. Do not overuse the preceding remedies.\n\n**Arctium Pill**\nTreats wind-toxin nodules, persistent scrofula, and unrelenting swelling and pain.\n- *Niú bàng zǐ* (arctium): 1 *liǎng*, lightly stir-fried\n- *Hé shǒu wū* (fleeceflower root): 1 *liǎng*\n- *Gān bò hé* (dried mint): 2 *liǎng*\n- *Xióng huáng* (realgar): 2 *liǎng*\n- *Niú huáng* (cow bezoar): 2 *qián*\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk): 2 *qián*\n- *Zào jiǎo* (honey locust bark): 7 pieces, pounded in 2 *shēng* of water, decocted into a paste\n\nGrind the above into powder, mixing with the honey locust paste to form pills the size of *wú tóng* seeds.

Take 2 *qián* per dose with rice water.\n\n**Proven Remedies for Throat Conditions**\nThe throat serves as the body’s vital passage, connecting to the stomach and facilitating breath. If heat toxins accumulate in the chest and diaphragm, generating wind-phlegm that stagnates and fails to disperse, it manifests as throat diseases—sores within the throat, resembling rotting flesh, causing swelling, pain, obstruction, and difficulty swallowing. Severe cases may produce a \"double tongue.\" Treatment should first dispel wind-phlegm to unblock the throat, then resolve heat toxins; delay risks irrecoverable consequences. Heat toxins attacking the upper palate may cause sores called \"suspended abscesses,\" while visceral cold can also impair swallowing. Carefully examine symptoms to apply appropriate treatments.\n\n**Toxin-Transforming Supportive Powder**\nTreats acute throat closure due to wind-heat attack, swollen and painful cheeks, as well as double and single *é* (tonsillitis), *jié hóu* (throat constriction), *chóng shé* (double tongue), and *mù shé* (wooden tongue), providing relief upon purgation.\n- *Xuán shēn* (figwort)\n- *Mù tōng* (akebia)\n- *Dà huáng* (rhubarb, raw)\n- *Dàn zhú yè* (bland bamboo leaf)\n- *Shān zhī zǐ* (gardenia)\n- *Shēng dì huáng* (raw rehmannia)\n- *Dēng cǎo* (rush pith)\n\nChop the ingredients, decoct in water, and take warm.\n\n**Emergency Gargle for Choking**\nMix *zào jiǎo* (honey locust) powder with water and sesame oil, or swallow *bǎi cǎo shuāng* (soot) for immediate relief.\n\n**Mountain Bean Root Decoction**\nTreats swollen, closed, and painful throat, gargled to expel phlegm. Holding the decoction in the mouth and swallowing brings immediate healing.\n- *Shān dòu gēn* (mountain bean root, detoxifying)\n- *Líng xiāo gēn* (trumpet creeper root, tissue-regenerating)\n- *Shān zhī zǐ* (gardenia)\n- *Dàn zhú yè* (bland bamboo leaf)\n- *Ài yè* (mugwort)\n- *Dēng cǎo* (rush pith)\n\nChop the ingredients. For drinkers, decoct with wine; for non-drinkers, use water. Pregnant women should avoid this remedy. Consuming five to six doses after throat sores heal prevents recurrence.\n\n**Throat-Blowing Wind-Dispelling Powder**\nTreats throat sores, swelling, and pain; *chán hóu fēng* (throat-constricting wind), single and double *é* (tonsillitis), *jié hóu* (throat constriction), acute throat wind, *fēi sī rù hóu* (ingested flying filaments), *chóng shé* (double tongue), and *mù shé* (wooden tongue).\n\n**Gallbladder Vitriol and Duck-Beak Marvel**\n\n- *Dǎn fán* (chalcanthite, roasted)\n- *Nǎo zǐ* (borneol, \"one character\" measure)\n- *Bì xuě* (sal ammoniac)\n- *Bái jiāng cán* (white silkworm larvae, stir-fried and silk removed)\n- *Kǔ dīng xiāng* (bitter melon pedicel, i.e., sweet melon base; use sparingly)\n- *Dēng cǎo* (rush pith, ground with rice-paste slurry)\n\nIf the condition does not resolve, add:\n- *Xióng huáng* (realgar)\n- *Zhū yá zào* (pig’s tooth soap bean, skin removed and roasted yellow)\n- *Yàn xiāo* (niter)\n- *Lí lú* (veratrum, skin and core removed)\n\nGrind all into a fine powder. Apply a small amount by blowing into the throat—if the sore has not yet formed, it will disperse swiftly; if already formed, it will rupture immediately, yielding instant healing. For severe cases, blow the powder into the nostrils. If phlegm is copious, urgently prepare a solution by grinding fresh mugwort leaves with rice vinegar, then hold in the mouth and rinse to expel phlegm, achieving immediate healing.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\nTake a pig’s gallbladder from the twelfth lunar month, fill it with *míng fán* (alum) powder, and hang it in the wind to dry. Remove the alum, grind it into powder, and blow it into the throat for instant efficacy. For those who suffer annual recurrences, moxibustion can prevent future outbreaks.\n\n**For Lockjaw**\nUse *jiǔ lóng chuān* (also called *jīn chāi cǎo*, \"golden hairpin herb\"), preferably a single-stemmed specimen. Peel the root, crush it, wrap in silk, and bind it to the end of a chopstick. Apply to the teeth five or six times to open the jaw, then apply similarly to the throat to expel phlegm and drool. Later, roast the herb, grind it into powder, and wrap it in silk with the powder to apply to the throat five or six times for healing. If symptoms recur after eating, crush fresh ginger, roast *zào jiǎo* (soap bean) until charred, and grind into powder. Wrap the ginger with salt and the powdered soap bean in silk, and apply to the throat five or six times for healing.\n\n**For Acute Throat-Constricting Wind**\nGrind fresh ginger with rice vinegar and administer as a rinse—throat sores will rupture immediately, yielding marvelous results.\n\n**Drumstick Herb and Local Ox-Knee**\nAdd *wū yào* (lindera root) for enhanced efficacy. Grind the two fresh herbs together, extract the juice, and administer with vinegar. For severe cases, pour into the nostrils to induce phlegm expulsion and healing. If using dried herbs, grind into powder and decoct with rice vinegar.\n\n**Divine Powder**\nTreats acute seasonal *chán hóu fēng* (throat-constricting wind) with progressive throat obstruction, inability to swallow food or water, lockjaw, and loss of consciousness.\n- *Xióng huáng* (realgar)\n- *Huá lú shēng* (raw veratrum)\n- *Bái fán* (alum)\n- *Yá zào* (soap bean, skin removed and roasted yellow)\n- Add *jié xiāo* (mantis egg-case, seven pieces)\n\nGrind all into a fine powder. Administer a \"one-character\" dose by blowing into the nostrils to induce the expulsion of stubborn phlegm for healing.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\nDecoct *bái yào* (white medicine) and *shān dòu gēn* (mountain bean root) together, hold in the mouth to rinse and expel phlegm, then swallow one or two mouthfuls.\n\n**Proven Remedy for Rabid Dog Bites**\nIf bitten by a rabid dog, immediately consume half a cup of pure oil to clear the heart. Urgently prepare *xióng huáng* (realgar) and stir-fried *bān máo* (blister beetle, with head, wings, and legs removed), grinding them into fine powder. Take one dose daily. Additionally, mix *xióng huáng* with wine and consume forty-nine doses over forty-nine days. Cold water with a small amount of pure oil may also be used, with the expulsion of foul toxins via urine as the benchmark. If urine does not flow, take an additional dose. After urination, if abdominal pain occurs, urgently mix *qīng diàn* (indigo) with cold water and consume to relieve symptoms; a decoction of *huáng lián* (coptis) may also be used. After taking the medicine, avoid consuming hot foods to ensure complete healing. Do not wait for the wound to heal—if it does not rupture, apply moxibustion to break it and release the toxic qi to prevent recurrence. If blood appears in the urine, the condition is incurable and will prove fatal. If the victim dies shortly after being bitten, urgently treat them. If symptoms appear within a year or a hundred days, and the victim is dead but the heart remains warm, they can still be saved. Urgently decoct one *jīn* (catty) of *huái huā* (pagoda tree flower) with two large bowls of water and wine, reducing it to one and a half bowls. Warm the decoction and use an implement to pry open the mouth, pouring it into the throat. After a short while, the victim will revive. One hour later, feed them warm, clear congee, and they will recover. If not, administer the dregs of the decoction. Avoid cold water and wind-inducing foods like mutton—strictly observe these prohibitions.\n\n**Another Proven Formula**\nFor recurrent cases with no other remedy, this method is highly effective.\n- *Míng xióng huáng* (clear realgar), five *qián* (mace)\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk), five *qián*\n\nGrind each into fine powder and mix evenly. Dissolve in two cups of wine and administer. If the patient refuses, pinch their nose and pour it down. After taking the medicine, the patient will inevitably sleep—do not disturb them. Allow them to sleep until they naturally revive, then administer the previous medicine again upon the expulsion of foul matter to achieve healing.\n\n**Another Proven Remedy**\nGrind *xìng rén* (apricot kernel, skin and tips removed) with *mǎ lán gēn* (horse orchid root) into a fine paste. First, wash the wound with a decoction of scallions, then apply the paste. Alternatively, use *xìng rén* alone (skin and tips removed).\n\n**Another Formula**\nUse fifty *bì má zǐ* (castor beans), remove the shells, and grind into a paste with well water. First, wash the wound with lye water, then apply the paste.\n\n**Another Formula**\nApply *hǔ gǔ yóu* (tiger bone oil) for instant efficacy.\n\n*Immortal-Transmitted External Medicine Secret Formulas, Scroll Seven*\n*Immortal-Transmitted External Medicine Secret Formulas, Scroll Eight*\n*Compiled by Zhao Yizhen of Junyi, the Original Yang Master*\n\n**On Various Abscess and Sore Formulas**\n\nThe physician’s use of medicine is like a general’s use of troops. As the saying goes: \"A thousand soldiers are easily found, but a single good general is hard to seek.\" Victory is decided by a skilled general; efficacy is decided by a skilled physician. Knowing whether troops will triumph or fall lies in the general’s command; knowing whether a patient will live or die lies in the physician’s diagnosis. Though an army may be vast, without a skilled general, the troops cannot prevail. Though a thousand formulas exist, without a skilled physician, the medicines cannot take effect. For a skilled general must have troops to command, just as a skilled physician must have medicines to prescribe. The general’s might lies in deploying unconventional tactics to defeat the enemy; the physician’s merit lies in using extraordinary remedies to cure illness. In warfare and medicine alike, one must first seek out skilled generals and physicians—without the right person, neither troops nor medicines can succeed. To preserve one’s health and avoid illness, one must follow the wise counsel of a skilled physician.\n\n*The Sagely Benefit Formulas* states: The *Neijing* asks, how does one distinguish between abscesses and sores? When the five viscera are disharmonious, abscesses arise. Those with long-standing wasting-thirst disorders often develop abscesses and sores. Immoderate eating and drinking, erratic joy and anger, insufficient yin qi, and excess yang qi disrupt the harmony of the constructive and defensive energies, causing blood to stagnate and fail to circulate. When blood stagnates, defensive qi cannot flow, and heat accumulates, giving rise to abscesses and sores, which generate intense heat. In severe cases, the flesh putrefies into pus, yet the condition does not penetrate the muscles and skin to the bones and marrow, nor does it scorch the marrow or damage the five viscera. However, if the muscles, skin, bones, and marrow become scorched, extending inward to the five viscera, and the blood and qi are exhausted, the disease may erode the sinews and bones, leaving no healthy flesh. Abscesses and sores may arise internally or externally: internally, they form between the chest, abdomen, and viscera; externally, they manifest on the surface of the skin, flesh, muscles, and bones. Though these two poisons arise without fixed locations, they bear consistent names.\n\nThe root of abscesses lies in stagnant blood that fails to induce sweating, internal stasis that does not shed impurities, and pent-up qi that cannot disperse outward, accumulating into heat. The formation of abscesses and sores with pus and fluid is neither heaven-sent nor earth-born—it is the result of accumulation. To safeguard life, one must exhaust all medical means to prevent harm, guard against incipient signs, and address disorders before they take shape—this is the principle of \"treating in the evening what is perceived in the morning.\" Yet illnesses arise in myriad forms, with varied triggers: as sores, boils, clove sores, abscesses, or deep-rooted sores. Though their initial signs may differ slightly, one must regard them with grave concern. Many dismiss them lightly, leading to countless deaths.\n\nWhen abscesses and sores first appear, their symptoms are subtle, and most people do not take them seriously—they should be treated promptly. Heat emerging between the skin layers causes superficial swelling with small roots, growing no larger than one or two *cun*—this is an abscess. When heat from the great fu-organs surges outward, it erupts violently, producing glossy, soft swelling that spreads widely—this is an abscess or deep-rooted sore. Some cases are deficient, others excessive: deficient conditions require supplementation; excessive conditions require drainage. Those with excess heat are easier to cure; those with deficient cold and pathogenic heat are harder to treat. Swelling that is firm and yields thick pus is excessive; swelling that is soft and yields thin pus is deficient. Most treatments lack method and order, and in the moment of urgency, how can one discern the depth of the illness? This is why so many perish.\n\nTreating abscesses and sores is like addressing a sudden collapse—where there is injury, there is suffering. Yet abscesses and sores demand urgent care. Those arising on the throat, tongue, face, brain, nape, shoulders, upper back, chest, diaphragm, or breasts—if located in perilous areas—are critical. They must be treated the same day they are detected, and recovery may still be possible. Without a skilled physician, or if one fails to grasp the analogy, even if a common doctor achieves a cure, it is mere luck. Most people do not regard these conditions as urgent, yet they truly require immediate treatment. Delay risks irreversible progression, and such cases often end in fatality. Treating these illnesses is like extinguishing a fire, rescuing the drowning, or pursuing fleeing bandits—delay invites disaster.\n\nAbscesses and sores manifest in three types: swelling that is elevated and soft arises from the blood vessels; swelling that is sunken and firm arises from the bones and flesh; swelling with unchanged skin color arises from the bone marrow. Shallow sores favor thin areas; deep sores favor thick areas. In abscesses and sores, pressing firmly elicits pain if the pus is deep; light pressure causes pain if the pus is shallow. If the pressed area does not rebound, there is no pus—it is water. If it rebounds, pus is present. Swelling that is entirely soft is a blood tumor, not an abscess. Swelling that gradually enlarges without excessive heat, with intermittent pulling pain, is a qi tumor. These are caused by knotted accumulations that do not dissipate over time, eventually developing into abscesses, deep-rooted sores, or clove sores—all due to cold qi. When cold lingers and accumulates, extreme yin generates yang, transforming cold into heat, leading to ulceration. Such ulcers invariably become fistulas.\n\nYet illnesses have shifting symptoms, and diseases wax and wane. To comprehend them fully requires more than fleeting insight—medicine is an art of intention, adapting to the moment’s demands.\n\n*The Sagely Benefit* states: Abscesses, deep-rooted sores, clove sores, breast abscesses, and boils exhibit the five favorable and seven adverse signs—these must not be overlooked. Restlessness with coughing, or abdominal pain with thirst, progressing to uncontrolled diarrhea, or urination resembling strangury—this is the first adverse sign. Copious pus and blood, severe swelling and inflammation, foul pus, and unrelenting pain—this is the second adverse sign. Labored breathing, shortness of breath, disorientation, and lethargy—this is the third adverse sign.\n\nGaze unsteady, with redness and swelling of the black of the eye, and the pupil turned upward—this is the fourth adverse sign. Stiffness of the shoulders and neck, with heaviness in the limbs—this is the fifth adverse sign. Inability to take food or drink, vomiting upon taking medicine, and loss of taste—this is the sixth adverse sign. Hoarse voice, pallid complexion, bluish-red lips and nose, with swelling of the face and limbs—this is the seventh adverse sign.\n\nPain subsiding on its own, with return of appetite and taste—this is the first favorable sign. Regular bowel movements and urination—this is the second favorable sign. Swelling and pus resolving spontaneously, with fresh color and no necrosis—this is the third favorable sign. Bright and clear spirit, with clear and resonant speech—this is the fourth favorable sign. Harmonious qi and body—this is the fifth favorable sign. If two of the five favorable signs appear, recovery is likely; if four of the seven adverse signs appear, danger is imminent.\n\nYet some diseases may originally share the seven adverse signs but present with tight skin like the favorable; others may originally share the five favorable signs but present with flaccid skin like the adverse. How could such subtleties be grasped by ordinary minds? If all five favorable signs converge, the condition is most auspicious. If all seven adverse signs manifest together, the crisis is severe.\n\nHerein are recorded the diagnostic signs, supplemented with acupoint observations for clarity. If pain arises subtly in the region of *mó* over the viscera, it is *fèi jū* (lung flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *fèi yōng* (lung abscess). If dull pain arises at *Jùquè*, it is *xīn jū* (heart flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *xīn yōng* (heart abscess). If dull pain arises at *Qīmén*, it is *gān jū* (liver flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *gān yōng* (liver abscess). If dull pain arises at *Zhāngmén*, it is *pí jū* (spleen flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *pí yōng* (spleen abscess). If dull pain arises at *Zhōngwǎn*, it is *wèi jū* (stomach flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *wèi yōng* (stomach abscess). If dull pain arises at *Jīngmén*, it is *shèn jū* (kidney flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *shèn yōng* (kidney abscess). If dull pain arises at *Tiānshū*, it is *dà cháng jū* (large intestine flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *dà cháng yōng* (large intestine abscess). If dull pain arises at *Dāntián*, it is *sān jiāo jū* (triple burner flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *sān jiāo yōng* (triple burner abscess). If dull pain arises at *Guānyuán*, it is *xiǎo cháng jū* (small intestine flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *xiǎo cháng yōng* (small intestine abscess). Examine the affected *mó* in the patient and, based on these signs, determine the depth of the abscess or flat-abscess. Identify which organ the disease originates from, what mineral or stone medicines the patient has previously consumed, assess the strength or weakness of their qi, and treat accordingly after careful consideration.\n\n*The Thousand Gold Pieces* states: Whenever an abscess or flat-abscess first appears—whether a large boil, small boil, large abscess, or small abscess—observe it closely. At the slightest abnormality, act with urgency and treat it immediately. Cease all consumption of toxic substances to allow healthy flesh to regenerate swiftly, and abstain from sexual activity for three months. Guard against cold winds and overexertion until the sinews, blood, and vessels fully recover; only then may one act freely. If precautions are not strictly observed, new flesh may be easily damaged, and severe injury may lead to further ulceration. If the condition recurs, disaster will follow—be vigilant, be vigilant.\n\nFor all abscesses and flat-abscesses at onset, administer *Zhuīdīng Duómìng Tāng* promptly to resolve internally, or use *Huàdú Xiāozhǒng Tuōguǒ Sǎn*, *Mìchuán Nèituō Qiānjīn Sǎn*, or *Shíliù Wèi Liúqì Yǐn*. For those with pronounced yin patterns, use *Nèihán Sǎn*. During treatment, apply *Jiědú Shēngjī Sǎn* topically, along with *Huàdú Sǎn* and *Xuè Bá dú Sǎn*. After applying *Huàdú Shēngjī* ointment, use an iron tube with *Bádu Gāo* to draw out toxins. For all such eruptions, if the condition does not stabilize, apply the treatment in a ring around the lesion until the skin breaks, at which point it will cease. At the initial stage, this will cause dispersal. If pus is present, use this method to rupture the lesion and drain the pus. If drainage is incomplete, use a medicinally boiled suction tube to extract the pus, toxic fluids, and blood, and recovery will follow.\n\nSwelling with a root spanning one to three *cùn* is a boil; two to five *cùn* is an abscess; five *cùn* to one *chǐ* is a flat-abscess; one to three *chǐ* is termed \"whole-body.\" Lesions the size of a bean are called *páozi*. When a flat-abscess forms pus and drains from all nine orifices, and once the pus is fully expelled, use tweezers to remove necrotic flesh until the root of the pus is eliminated, then apply flesh-generating and pain-relieving medicine. Once the flesh is replenished, use a paper-shielded medicinal plaster.\n\nIt is further stated: When qi stagnates in the channels and collaterals, causing both blood and qi to congeal and fail to circulate, abscesses and flat-abscesses form. Though not initially attributed to heat, the subsequent development of abscesses arises from yang qi converging, where cold transforms into heat. When heat prevails, flesh putrefies into pus. This occurs when the body harbors heat, which is then constrained by cold, causing the vessels to congeal and stagnate, leading to the formation of abscesses and flat-abscesses.\n\nDeep pressure eliciting pain indicates a deep-seated condition; light pressure eliciting pain indicates a shallow condition. If the pressed area does not rebound, there is no pus; if it rebounds, pus is present. If it does not rebound, the condition may still resolve. If pressing causes overall tension, pus has not yet formed. If the area is partially soft upon pressing, pus is present. If the area feels cool to the touch, there is no pus; if it is markedly hot, pus is present. Upon detecting pus, it should be drained immediately. If there is only qi-induced swelling without pus but with blood, exercise extreme caution—do not lance it. Instead, apply *Qiānjīn Bádu Gāo* to contain it.\n\nIf the periphery is firm but the center is soft, pus is certainly present; if one side is soft, pus may also be present. If the entire area is firm, it is a malignant nodule, possibly due to qi stagnation. If the entire area is soft, it is a blood mass—a blood tumor. Carefully assess firmness, softness, deficiency, and excess, as these are critical.\n\nFor long-standing firm flat-abscesses that later develop heat and localized softening, the softened area must not be lanced. For soft flat-abscesses, keep the patient warmly clothed and covered—if lanced or needled, they cannot be cured. For abscesses with pus, do not hesitate due to thick skin; drain them promptly. In cases of bone abscesses, where the skin color remains unchanged, administer *Huàdú Xiāozhǒng Tuōguǒ Sǎn* and *Zǒumǎ Sǎn* urgently, and apply *Huàdú Bádu Sǎn* topically to draw out toxins and remove stagnant blood. If no pus forms, the condition will resolve.\n\nWhen blood or pus is discharged, use a needle on the skin, inserting it three to four *fen* deep. If pus is to be drained, do not pierce directly at the apex; instead, incise from the lower edge to ensure proper drainage. Once the pus is fully expelled, new flesh will grow. Apply a flesh-generating topical powder, followed by a medicated plaster, and healing will follow.\n\nIt is further stated: When an abscess arises on the neck, it is called *yāo jū* (\"heavenly carbuncle\"). Its appearance is large, red, and black. If not treated promptly, the heat-qi will descend into the *yuān yè* region, damaging the *Rèn mài* (Conception Vessel), and internally scorching the liver and lungs, leading to death within ten days. As the classics say: \"The front of the neck is called the *xiàng*.\"\n\nAccording to the *Wèijì Bǎoshū* (\"Treasured Book of Guarding and Saving\"): One *cùn* and three *fēn* behind the ear lies the \"gate of life\"; an abscess here is fatal, and thus *ruì dú* (\"sharp toxin\") is incurable. *Ruì dú* refers to the virulence of the toxin, also called *fā yí* (\"swollen jaw\"). When heat-qi steams upward, affecting the forehead and mouth, it may pierce the throat, causing instant death.\n\nWhen a *nǎo jū* (\"brain carbuncle\") develops, heat-qi attacks the brain, emerging through the skin as a head lesion. Initially, it resembles a millet grain, with redness, swelling, and hardness spreading to the ears and neck, accompanied by chills, fever, and pain. If not treated urgently, the toxin will penetrate the flesh and blood, causing putrefaction and the discharge of pus and fluid from the head. As the blood and qi are internally depleted, death is inevitable.\n\nThe *Wàitái* (\"Outer Platform\") states: Any abscess arising in the throat is called *měng jū* (\"fierce carbuncle\"). If not treated promptly, blood will turn to pus, and if not drained, it will obstruct the throat, leading to death. If blood transforms into pus within half a day and the pus is not expelled, the patient will be unable to eat and will perish in three days. Another text says: Without food, *yáng* qi surges violently, consuming the brain and scorching the carbuncle, and the complexion will be joyless. Alternatively, if there is neck pain as if pierced by a needle, with heart vexation, death is certain, and it cannot be treated. One must also assess the deficiency or excess of qi and deliberate carefully in treatment.\n\nIt is further stated: When an abscess arises on the chest, it is called *jǐng jū* (\"well carbuncle\"). It resembles a soybean in size and will develop over three to four days. If not treated early, it will descend into the abdomen, and if it enters the abdomen without treatment, death will occur in ten days. Persistent chills and fever also lead to death.\n\nIt is also said: When an abscess arises on a toe, it is called *tuō jū* (\"shedding carbuncle\"). If it appears red and black without fluid, it is fatal and untreatable. If it is not red and black but contains fluid, it may be treated. If treatment fails to improve the condition, the toe must be promptly amputated to save the patient’s life; otherwise, death will follow.\n\nThe *Shènghuì* (\"Sagely Benefit\") states: If pus and fluid continue to discharge from a wound and the wound opening closes prematurely, though it may appear healed, the wind-toxin remains unresolved. When foul fluid recurs and discharges rapidly, it will transform into a fistula. This warning must be heeded and guarded against carefully. The formulas follow below.\n\nFirst, administer *Zhuīténg Duómìng Tāng* (\"Pain-Pursuing Life-Snatching Decoction\") for immediate effect; the formula is provided later.\n\n*Huàdú Xiāozhǒng Tuōguǒ Sǎn* (\"Toxin-Transforming, Swelling-Reducing, Supporting and Enveloping Powder\") is specifically for treating *yōng jū* (deep-rooted abscesses), *fā bèi* (back carbuncles), *fā rǔ* (breast abscesses), *gǔ yōng* (bone abscesses), *dīng chuāng* (boils), swollen toxins, and all types of malignant sores, as well as painful swollen throats.\n\nIngredients:\n- *Rénshēn* (Ginseng; *Panax ginseng*; may be omitted if unavailable) – 6 *qián*\n- *Chì fúlíng* (Red Poria; *Poria cocos*) – 6 *qián*\n- *Bái mù* (White Wood; likely *Phellodendron chinense*) – 6 *qián*\n- *Huáshí* (Talcum) – 2 *liǎng*\n- *Jié gěng* (Platycodon; *Platycodon grandiflorus*) – 2 *liǎng*\n- *Jīnyín huā* (Honeysuckle Flower; *Lonicera japonica*) – 2 *liǎng*\n- *Jīngjiè suì* (Schizonepeta Spike; *Schizonepeta tenuifolia*) – 5 *qián*\n- *Shān zhīzǐ* (Gardenia Fruit; *Gardenia jasminoides*) – 5 *qián*\n- *Dāng guī* (Chinese Angelica Root; *Angelica sinensis*) – 1 *liǎng*\n- *Chuān xiōng* (Sichuan Lovage Rhizome; *Ligusticum chuanxiong*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Huáng cáo* (likely *Huáng qín*; Scutellaria; *Scutellaria baicalensis*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Chì sháo* (Red Peony Root; *Paeonia lactiflora*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Cāng zhú* (Atractylodes Rhizome; *Atractylodes lancea*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Má huáng* (Ephedra; *Ephedra sinica*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Dà huáng* (Rhubarb; *Rheum palmatum*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Huáng qín* (Scutellaria; *Scutellaria baicalensis*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Fáng fēng* (Saposhnikovia Root; *Saposhnikovia divaricata*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Gān cǎo* (Licorice Root; *Glycyrrhiza uralensis*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Bò hé* (Peppermint; *Mentha haplocalyx*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Lián qiào* (Forsythia Fruit; *Forsythia suspensa*) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Shí gāo* (Gypsum) – [dosage omitted]\n- *Máng xiāo* (Mirabilite; *Natrii Sulfas*) – #6 (add *suō shā* [Amomum Fruit; *Amomum villosum*] if not using this)\n\nAlternatively, add:\n- *Guā lóu* (Trichosanthes Fruit; *Trichosanthes kirilowii*)\n- *Mǔ lì* (Oyster Shell; *Ostrea gigas*)\n- *Bèi mǔ* (Fritillaria Bulb; *Fritillaria thunbergii*)\n- *Mù xiāng* (Costus Root; *Saussurea costus*)\n\nFor *dīng chuāng* (boils), add *jiǎo lián* (likely *Bletilla striata*) and *hé chē* (likely *Lotus Node; Nelumbo nucifera*).\n\nFor *chén gān* (infantile malnutrition), add *chē qián zǐ* (Plantain Seed; *Plantago asiatica*), *mù tōng* (Akebia Stem; *Akebia quinata*), and *zhú yè* (Bamboo Leaf; *Phyllostachys nigra*). For pain, add *rǔ xiāng* (Frankincense; *Boswellia carteri*) and *mò yào* (Myrrh; *Commiphora myrrha*). For sore throat, add *dà huáng* (Rhubarb Root; *Rheum palmatum*), *zhī zǐ* (Gardenia Fruit; *Gardenia jasminoides*), *zhú yè* (Bamboo Leaf), and *dēng cǎo* (Rush Pith; *Juncus effusus*). For *jiǎo qì* (beriberi), add *xuān mù guā* (Chaenomeles Fruit; *Chaenomeles speciosa*) and *bīng láng* (Areca Seed; *Areca catechu*). For cough, add *bàn xià* (Pinellia Rhizome; *Pinellia ternata*) prepared with ginger juice, and decoct with fresh ginger.\n\nGrind the above ingredients, take five *qián* per dose, decoct with one bowl of water and one scallion stalk until hot, and consume until sweating occurs. If bowel movements occur three to five times after consumption, the effect is optimal. Severe illnesses will resolve within three to five doses, with internal toxins fully dissolved.\n\n**Internal-Supporting Thousand-Gold Powder** specializes in treating *yōng jū* (deep-rooted abscesses), *fā bèi* (back carbuncles), *nǎo jū* (scalp abscesses), *rǔ yōng* (breast abscesses), and various malignant *jié lòu* (festering sores).\n\n*Rén shēn* (Ginseng; *Panax ginseng*)\n*Dāng guī* (Chinese Angelica Root; *Angelica sinensis*)\n*Huáng qí* (Astragalus Root; *Astragalus membranaceus*)\n*Bái sháo yào* (White Peony Root; *Paeonia lactiflora*)\n*Chuān xiōng* (Sichuan Lovage Rhizome; *Ligusticum chuanxiong*)\n*Fáng fēng* (Saposhnikovia Root; *Saposhnikovia divaricata*)\n*Guān guì* (Cinnamon Bark; *Cinnamomum cassia*)\n*Jié gěng* (Platycodon Root; *Platycodon grandiflorus*)\n*Bái zhǐ* (Angelica Root; *Angelica dahurica*)\n*Gān cǎo* (Licorice Root; *Glycyrrhiza uralensis*)\n*Guā lóu* (Trichosanthes Fruit; *Trichosanthes kirilowii*)\n*Jīn yín huā* (Honeysuckle Flower; *Lonicera japonica*) – equal parts each\n\nFor severe pain, add *dāng guī*, *sháo yào*, *rǔ xiāng*, and *mò yào*.\n\nGrind the above ingredients, take seven to eight *qián* per dose, decoct with two large cups of water until reduced to seven parts, add half a cup of good wine, strain, and consume warm. Take two to three doses daily. If black blood or sweat appears at the wound site, this indicates the efficacy of the medicine. Regardless of the severity of the condition, use one *liǎng* of the medicine, decoct with one large bowl of water, and consume with wine. If the abscess has not yet formed, it will disperse; if already formed, it will rupture.\n\n**Secret Sixteen-Ingredient Qi-Flowing Decoction** (also called **Internal-Nourishing Powder**): The first ten ingredients are the same as the **Internal-Supporting Powder**.\n\n*Rén shēn* (Ginseng; *Panax ginseng*) – remove the rhizome\n*Dāng guī* (Chinese Angelica Root; *Angelica sinensis*) – wine-washed\n*Guān guì* (Cinnamon Bark; *Cinnamomum cassia*) – remove the bark\n*Chuān xiōng* (Sichuan Lovage Rhizome; *Ligust\n\nFirst fumigate, then wait until the temperature cools before use. Wash the area thoroughly, then pat dry with silk cloth. Apply the **Flesh-Generating Pain-Relieving Powder**, mixed with clear oil to a stiff consistency, spreading it evenly. If the wound is wet, apply dry powder. Do not leave an opening if there is no pus; change the dressing once daily. If pus is present, leave an opening to drain toxins and remove pus. After applying the medicine, cover with black paper and bind tightly with silk strips, wrapping three to five turns. Change the outer dressing every three days, avoiding disturbance, and efficacy will soon manifest. If necrotic flesh must be removed: take one live centipede, place it in a bamboo tube filled with oil to drown, then calcine and grind into powder. Add a small amount to the previous application and apply for one full day. If pain persists, wash off this medicine and reapply the previous one; the pain will cease, and new flesh will grow.\n\nApply the medicine around the wound.

It also powerfully relieves pain. Taken internally, it warms and harmonizes, resolves toxins, and disperses blood stasis. For internal support, take a large piece of fresh ginger (with skin), pound it with the medicine in high-quality ash-free wine, and consume warm. For ailments in the upper body, take after meals; for those in the lower body, take before sleep. After one or two doses, the swelling will fully resolve.\n\n**Iron Tube Toxin-Extracting Plaster** punctures and resolves all sores and boils; if applied at the initial stage, the swelling will disperse immediately:\n*Shí huī* (High-quality lime) – uncalcined\n*Zào jiǎo* (Chinese Honeylocust; *Gleditsia sinensis*) – fumigated\n*Nuò mǐ* (Glutinous Rice; *Oryza sativa* var. *glutinosa*)\n*Nán xīng* (Jack-in-the-Pulpit Rhizome; *Arisaema erubescens*)\n*Dāng guī* (Chinese Angelica Root; *Angelica sinensis*)\n*Chì sháo* (Red Peony Root; *Paeonia lactiflora*) – stir-fried together\n*Náo shā* (Sal Ammoniac; *Ammonium chloride*) – add only to remove *dīng* (deep-rooted boils), omit otherwise\n*Shā gǔ niú* (Cow Bezoar)\n*Bān máo* (Mylabris; *Mylabris phalerata*)\nBoil the above with the following ashes in hot water, strain the liquid, and mix with the previous medicine for use:\n*Zhēn tàn huī* (Charcoal Ash)\n*Sāng chái huī* (Mulberry Wood Ash)\n*Zhī ma huī* (Sesame Ash)\n*Zào jiǎo* (Chinese Honeylocust) – 3–4 pieces\n*Liǔ chái huī* (Willow Wood Ash)\nSimmer the ash liquid in a pot over low heat until a white frost forms on the surface, then remove from heat. Store in a vessel and use to mix with the previous medicine. Apply sparingly three to five times; once the skin breaks and toxic qi is expelled, stop when fluid ceases.\n\n**Toxin-Sucking Bamboo Tube** for *fā bèi* (carbuncles of the back), *yōng jū* (deep-rooted abscesses), *dīng chuāng* (deep-rooted boils), and toxic swellings—use this to draw out pus, blood, and foul fluid:\n*Cāng zhú* (Atractylodes Rhizome; *Atractylodes lancea*) – equal parts\n*Bái liǎn* (Ampelopsis Root; *Ampelopsis japonica*)\n*Wū jiù pí* (Chinese Tallow Tree Bark; *Triadica sebifera*)\n*Hòu pò* (Magnolia Bark; *Magnolia officinalis*)\n*Ài yè* (Mugwort Leaf; *Artemisia argyi*)\n*Hǎo chá yá* (Fine Tea Buds)\n*Bái jí* (Bletilla Rhizome; *Bletilla striata*)\n*Bái jí lí* (Tribulus Fruit; *Tribulus terrestris*)\nPrepare by taking three, five, or seven bamboo tubes, each one *cùn* long, leaving a node at one end. Peel the green outer layer until as thin as paper, then use according to size. Boil the tubes with the above medicine for ten rounds until the medicine is fully absorbed.\n\nWhile the bamboo tubes are still hot, press them firmly onto the sore, tightly adhering to the wound. When filled with pus, blood, or fluid, they will naturally detach. If not, remove them by hand and replace with another tube. Repeat this three to five times until the toxin is fully drawn out, then apply flesh-generating medicine. Once the wound is filled internally, use a medicated plaster to achieve healing.\n\nThe *Immortal Formula Paper-Isolated Plaster* (also called *Divine Response Plaster*) is specially effective for treating *fā bèi* (deep-rooted back abscesses), *rǔ yōng* (breast abscesses), *wài lián* (lower leg ulcers), and all kinds of malignant toxic sores and boils.\n\n*Huáng lián* (Coptis Rhizome) – half *liǎng*\n*Hé shǒu wū* (Fleeceflower Root, peeled) – half *liǎng*\n*Cǎo wū* (Wild Aconite, peeled) – half *liǎng*\n*Dāng guī wěi* (Chinese Angelica Tail) – half *liǎng*\n*Bái zhǐ* (Dahurian Angelica Root) – half *liǎng*\n*Chuān wū* (Sichuan Aconite, peeled) – two and a half *qián*\n\nLater, add:\n*Huáng dān* (Lead Oxide) – one *liǎng* (two *liǎng* in summer)\n*Rǔ xiāng* (Frankincense) – half *liǎng*\n*Mò yào* (Myrrh) – half *liǎng*\n*Xuè xuě* (Dragon’s Blood) – half *liǎng*\n\nGrind all the above ingredients coarsely. Heat five *liǎng* of clear oil with the medicine in a pot over a gentle flame until the herbs turn black. Strain through cloth to remove the dregs, then return the medicated oil to the pot. Add *huáng dān* and stir continuously with a bundle of peach and willow twigs. When the mixture turns black again, add the finely ground *xuè xuě*, *rǔ xiāng*, and *mò yào*, stirring well. Briefly heat until the mixture forms beads in water that do not disperse. Transfer to an earthenware bowl and soak in cold water for a full day and night to remove the fire toxin. The result is divinely effective.\n\nThe *Great Unity Divine Response Plaster* (also called *Golden Thread Universal Plaster* or *Ten-Thousand Spirits Plaster*) is specially effective for treating *fā bèi* (deep-rooted back abscesses), *yōng jū* (deep-rooted boils), *zhàng chuāng* (flogging wounds), malignant sores, traumatic injuries, heart pain, leg qi, and lumbar pain—none it does not cure.\n\n*Chuān wū* (Sichuan Aconite) – one *qián*\n*Cǎo wū* (Wild Aconite) – half *qián*\n*Huáng lián* (Coptis Rhizome) – two *qián*\n*Huáng bǎi* (Phellodendron Bark) – one *qián*\n*Chì sháo yào* (Red Peony Root) – one *qián*\n*Bái sháo yào* (White Peony Root) – one *qián*\n*Xuán hú suǒ* (Corydalis Rhizome) – one *qián*\n*Guī wěi* (Chinese Angelica Tail) – one and a half *qián*\n*Liáng jiāng* (Galangal Rhizome) – half *qián*\n*Mù biē* (Momordica Seed, shelled) – half *qián*\n*Jiāng cán* (Silkworm, silk removed) – one *qián*\n*Luàn fà* (Human Hair, the size of a chicken egg, burned to ash, added later) – one *qián*\n*Zǐ kè pí* (Bark of *Citrus wilsonii*) – half *qián*\n*Dì lóng* (Earthworm) – half *qián*\n*Shí nán téng* (Pieris Vine) – half *qián*\n*Chuān shān jiǎ* (Pangolin Scales) – half *qián*\n*Bái zhǐ* (Dahurian Angelica Root) – half *qián*\n*Chuān xiōng* (Sichuan Lovage Rhizome) – half *qián*\n*Qiān niú* (Morning Glory Seed) – half *qián*\n*Huái huā* (Pagoda Tree Flower) – half *qián*\n*Wǔ bèi zǐ* (Chinese Gall) – half *qián*\n*Dì gǔ pí* (Wolfberry Root Bark) – half *qián*\n*Xìng rén* (Apricot Kernel) – half *qián*\n*Huā jiāo* (Sichuan Pepper) – half *qián*\n*Huí xiāng* (Fennel Seed) – half *qián*\n*Máo xiāng* (Vetiver Root) – half *qián*\n*Xuán shēn* (Figwort Root) – half *qián*\n*Cāng ěr cǎo* (Xanthium Herb) – half *qián*\n*Guì pí* (Cinnamon Bark) – half *qián*\n*Nán xīng* (Jack-in-the-Pulpit Rhizome) – half *qián*\n*Guā lóu* (Trichosanthes Fruit) – half *qián*\n*Kǔ shēn* (Sophora Root) – half *qián*\n*Cāng zhú* (Atractylodes Rhizome) – half *qián*\n*Wǔ jiā pí* (Acanthopanax Root Bark) – half *qián*\n*Fáng fēng* (Saposhnikovia Root) – one *qián*\n*Shú dì huáng* (Prepared Rehmannia Root) – one *qián*\n*Mì tuó sēng* (Litharge) – one *qián*\n*Dīng xiāng* (Clove) – one *qián*\n*Nèi xiāo* (Sal Ammoniac) – one *qián*\n*Yè běn* (Wild Angelica Root) – one *qián*\n*Shēng dì huáng* (Fresh Rehmannia Root) – two and a half *qián*\n* Hé shǒu wū* (Fleeceflower Root) – one and a half *qián*\n*Xì xīn* (Asarum Herb) – one and a half *qián*\n*Jiāng zǐ* (Croton Seed, shelled) – twenty-five seeds\n*Rén shēn* (Ginseng Root) – two and a half *qián*\n*Bì má zǐ* (Castor Bean, shelled) – twenty-five seeds\n*Hàn lián cǎo* (Eclipta Herb) – half *qián*\n*Huáng qí* (Astragalus Root) – one *qián*\n*Bǎi yào jiān* (Sumac Gallnut) – two and a half *qián*\n*Qiāng huó* (Notopterygium Root) – one *qián*\n*Nán mù xiāng* (Costus Root) – half *qián*\n*Gān cǎo jié* (Licorice Node) – one *qián*\n*Dì yú gēng* (Burnet Root) – one *qián*\n*Dà yān zhī* (Rouge) – one *qián*\n\nGrind the above ingredients coarsely. Soak in one *jīn* and four *liǎng* of clear oil for one or two nights, then heat in a pot over a gentle flame until the herbs turn black. Strain through cloth to remove the dregs, then return the medicated oil to the pot over a gentle flame. Gradually add the following finely ground powders:\n\n*Nán mù xiāng* (Costus Root) – two and a half *qián*\n*Ān xī xiāng* (Benzoin) – two *qián*\n*Hǔ pò* (Amber) – two and a half *qián*\n*Yún xiāng* (Clove) – one *qián*\n*Rǔ xiāng* (Frankincense) – half *liǎng*\n*Mò yào* (Myrrh) – half *liǎng*\n*Xuè xuě* (Dragon’s Blood) – half *liǎng*\n*Xiāng jié* (Resin of *Dalbergia odorifera*, or *Jiàng zhēn xiāng* knots) – half *liǎng*\n*Sháo fěn* (Lead Carbonate) – one *qián*\n*Zì rán tóng* (Pyrite, vinegar-quenched) – one and a half *qián*\n*Sāng bái pí* (Mulberry Root Bark) – five *qián*\n*Bái jí* (Bletilla Rhizome) – five *qián*\n*Bái liǎn* (Ampelopsis Root) – five *qián*\n*Xióng huáng* (Realgar) – five *qián* (dried over fire)\n*Huáng dān* (Lead Oxide) – six *liǎng* (add two *liǎng* in summer)\n\nFirst, add the medicated oil, then the *huáng dān*, stirring continuously with peach, willow, or pagoda tree twigs.\nNext, add *zì rán tóng*, *bái jí*, *sāng bái pí*, *bái liǎn*, and *sháo fěn*.\nThen add *mù xiāng*, *hǔ pò*, *ān xī xiāng*, *yún xiāng*, *rǔ xiāng*, *xuè xuě*, *mò yào*, and *xiāng jié*. When the mixture turns black and forms beads in water that do not disperse, pour it into an earthenware bowl. Soak in water for two or three days to remove the fire toxin, then leave it on the ground for another three to five days for best results. Apply as needed.\n\nTo make the *Golden Thread Plaster*, grind all the above medicines into fine powder. Melt one *jīn* of clear *sōng xiāng* (pine resin) in a pot, strain through palm fiber, then add four *liǎng* of clear oil and heat until cooked. Add one *liǎng* of *huáng dān* and continue heating until the mixture forms beads in water that do not disperse. Remove and soak in water, changing the water daily (every other day in winter).\n\nFor *fā bèi* (deep-rooted back abscesses) that appear black and painless, this indicates a *yīn* condition. Boil one *jīn* of *ài yè* (mugwort leaf) with half a *liǎng* each of *xióng huáng* (realgar) and *liú huáng* (sulfur) for half a day. Apply warm, then boil fresh mugwort and reapply ten or more times. If pain occurs, recovery is possible; if no pain and black blood appears, death is certain.\n\nFor *fā bèi* that spreads uncontrollably at onset, use this medicine to encircle the sore:\nBurn *bái yán méi* (salted plum) and *zào jiǎo* (Chinese honey locust) to ash, retaining their nature, and grind into fine powder. For cases without heat, mix with rice vinegar and apply around the sore to contain it; replace frequently to prevent spreading. Adding ginger juice to the vinegar enhances the effect. For cases with heat, mix with tea infusion and apply to encircle the sore—immediate efficacy.\n\nThis treatment is most divinely effective for *fā bèi* whether already ulcerated or not.\n\nMagnolia bark (processed with ginger) 2 *qián*; tangerine peel (white pith removed); roasted licorice node 2 *qián*; *cāng zhú* (soaked in rice-water wash) 5 *qián* in weight.

For ulcerated sores, apply dry; for unbroken sores, mix with clear oil and apply.\n\n*Internal Stabilizing Heart-Clearing Powder*: Treats virulent sores with intense heat, swelling, pain, thirst, and restlessness. This medicine resolves toxins with divine efficacy.\nCinnabar; *fú líng*; ginseng; white cardamom; realgar; mung beans; *pò xiāo*; licorice; borneol; musk; Chinese honey locust—equal parts.\nGrind all into fine powder. Take 1 *qián* per dose, mixed with honey water.\n\n*Pus-Penetrating Powder*: Treats all kinds of abscesses and bone-adhering sores that do not rupture. Without need for needles or blades, a single dose will cause spontaneous penetration within hours. Repeated use proves effective.\nSilkworm cocoons from which moths have emerged.\nBurn the cocoons to ash, mix with wine, and administer. The sore will immediately penetrate.\n**Caution**: Do not use two or three cocoons when burning. If one cocoon is used, only one sore opening will form; if two or three are used, multiple openings will appear. Do not take this lightly.\n\n*Compendium of Divine Transmissions in External Medicine, Scroll Eight* (conclusion)\n\n**1** *Treatises on Various Abscesses and Sores*: This heading was originally absent and has been added based on the text’s content.\n**2** *hé*: Likely should read *lì* (efficacy).\n**3** *mó*: Appears as *mù* in *Secret Transmissions in External Medicine*.\n**4** *mó*: Appears as *mù* in *Secret Transmissions in External Medicine*.\n**5** *mó*: Appears as *mù* in *Secret Transmissions in External Medicine*.\n**6** *máng xiāo*: Dosages for the thirteen ingredients from *chuān xiōng* upward are originally missing.\n**7** *xuè xiē*: Appears as *xuè jié* (dragon’s blood) in *Secret Transmissions in External Medicine*.\n**8** *le*: Originally *zǐ*; amended per manuscript.\n**9** *èr liǎng*: Likely missing the character *gè* (each) above.\n**10** *tí*: Likely should read *tí* (hoof).\n**11** *shā*: Likely a small-script annotation, to be read with the preceding character.\n**12** Dosage for *rǔ xiāng* (frankincense) originally missing.\n**13** *mò*: Manuscript includes the character *cài* below.\n**14** *dà*: Absent in manuscript.\n**15** *dà yān zhī*: Appears as *wǔ líng zhī* in manuscript.\n\n*Collected and Verified Divine Transmissions in External Medicine*\n**Title**: *Collected and Verified Divine Transmissions in External Medicine*\n**Alternate Title**: *Divine Transmissions in External Medicine: Secret Formulas*\nCompiled by Yáng Qīngsǒu of the Yuán dynasty; edited by Zhào Yízhēn of the Míng dynasty.\nEleven scrolls.\n**Source Text**: *Daoist Canon of the Zhèngtǒng Era*, *Tàipíng* Section.\n**Collated with**: Míng dynasty block-printed edition; Qīng dynasty manuscript held at the National Library of China (hereafter \"manuscript\"); block-printed *Secret Transmissions in External Medicine*.\n\n*Divine Transmissions in External Medicine: Secret Formulas, Scroll Nine*\nCollected by Zhào Yízhēn, the Yuányáng Master of Jùnyí.\n\n**On the Forms and Symptoms of Back Abscesses**\n\n**Abscess of the Back**\nAn abscess arising on the back may span a foot in width and penetrate a foot in depth. If it ulcerates to the bone but does not breach the membrane, the patient will not die. This condition stems from consuming contaminated food, whereby the toxin lodges between the spleen and abdomen. Urgent treatment must target the poison in the spleen and abdomen, attacking it both internally and externally. As the spleen readily putrefies, swift administration of medicine is essential. At onset, employ *Decoction for Pursuing the Nail and Seizing Life* to achieve internal resolution (the formula appears at the end). Use *Powder for Transforming Toxin, Dispersing Swelling, and Supporting the Interior* and *Powder for Internal Support Worth a Thousand Gold* to consolidate. During the intermediate stage, apply *Medicine for Resolving Toxin, Generating Flesh, and Alleviating Pain* to the center, and *Powder for Drawing Out Toxin* around the periphery. Conclude with *Ointment for Generating Flesh* to ensure efficacy.\n\n**Lotus-Seed Abscess**\nThis abscess arises on the right, where the toxin from the spleen may surge toward the heart. Given the intensity of heart fire, oral medicine must be used to disperse it, while topical applications intercept the toxin to prevent it from attacking the heart. If the entire back swells, it is incurable; only if the swelling subsides can it be treated.\n\nAll sores—whether painful or itchy—originate in the heart, for the heart governs the blood and circulates qi. For migratory painful sores, apply *Powder with Supreme Monarch* and administer fire needling three or four times at the site for optimal effect. Use the aforementioned *Powder for Transforming Toxin, Dispersing Swelling, and Supporting the Interior*, adding *arisaema*, *wild aconite*, *momordica*, *fritillaria*, *garlic*, and *fresh ginger*, mixed with rice vinegar. Apply while leaving an opening, and within two or three days, the swelling will fully resolve. Keep the area moistened with vinegar.\n\n**Honeycomb Abscess**\nThis abscess, with its head at the top, is most difficult to treat and constitutes a counterflow pattern. Careful medication is required, for it is called *Honeycomb Abscess*. Treatment relies on oral medicine to support the interior, generate flesh, alleviate pain, and disperse blood, lest the toxin attack the heart and penetrate the membrane, rendering it nearly incurable due to lingering heart fire.\n\n**Migratory Scrofula Abscess**\nCommonly misattributed to the \"turtle’s shadow\" in folk sayings, medical texts contain no such reference. The notion that a turtle’s offspring causes this on the back is unfounded; rather, the toxin rides wind-heat to migrate. This condition arises from excessive wind generating extreme heat, which in turn causes qi to scatter. Urgent dispersal of wind and settling of heat will naturally calm the qi. The medicine for this is akin to deploying troops to quell disorder. If the toxin flows to the hands, feet, or legs, death is certain.\n\n**Abscess of the Kidney Transport**\nThis condition results from dampness, pent-up anger, and consumption of hot liquor, injuring the internal kidneys and causing toxin to flow to the kidney transport points. Swift application of both oral and topical medicines is required to resolve the toxin within the kidneys, employing flesh-generating remedies in a dual internal-external assault. If the abscess arises in the yin aspect and damages the kidney membrane, it becomes difficult to treat. Strictly avoid anger and sexual activity; even minor transgressions will render it incurable. Exercise utmost caution.\n\n**Dual Abscess of the Kidney Transport and Spleen Abscess**\nThis condition manifests as dual abscesses below the kidney transport points, caused by consuming hot liquor, engaging in sexual activity, harboring anger, or contracting dampness. If it arises in the yang aspect externally, it is treatable. However, if phlegm or yin abscesses damage the kidney membrane, resulting in thin pus, this indicates deficiency and is nearly incurable, inevitably fatal.\n\nA spleen abscess arising between the left shoulder blades may be treated at onset by pricking with a lamp wick and inducing sweating with *Decoction for Pursuing the Nail*, which will disperse it.\n\n**Right Shoulder Abscess**\nThis abscess arises on the right shoulder bone. Though treatable, it is difficult to stabilize due to movement. If it spreads to the left shoulder, it becomes nearly incurable. Apply medicinal powders as directed in the *Left Shoulder Abscess* formula.\n\n**Left Shoulder Abscess**\nThis abscess arises on the left shoulder bone. Though treatable, it is difficult to stabilize due to movement. If it spreads to the right shoulder, it becomes nearly incurable. Use chicken yolk membrane or silk floss, baked dry and ground into powder. Apply dry if the area is moist, or mix with clear oil for application if dry.\n\n**Abscess Opposite the Heart**\nThis abscess arises directly opposite the heart due to exuberant heart fire and the convergence of heat qi in this region. The toxin grows increasingly virulent and migratory. Urgent use of medicine to course and discharge heart fire is required, followed by flesh-generating remedies to achieve resolution.\n\n**Honeycomb Abscess of the Chest**\nThis honeycomb abscess arises between the chest and breast due to exuberant heart fire. Treatment relies on the aforementioned medicine for coursing heart fire. Any delay risks the heat attacking the heart, resulting in certain death.\n\n**Honeycomb Abscess of the Occiput**\nThis abscess arises at the back of the head in a honeycomb pattern. Urgent treatment is required. If it presents with redness, swelling, and pain, it is easily cured; if phlegm is involved, it becomes nearly incurable. Prompt oral and topical treatment is essential. Should it spread to both shoulders, it is absolutely incurable.\n\n**Two-Headed Back Abscess**\nIf this abscess has two small heads with toxin spreading outward, it arises from dietary factors, where qi and food interact and combine due to deficiency. Qi deficiency causes dispersion, widening the opening. Urgent administration of medicine for internal resolution is required, along with yang supplementation.\n\n**Abscesses and Flat Abscesses of the Flanks**\nThese abscesses and flat abscesses form beneath the flanks due to deficiency and qi vacuity. Under no circumstances should yang-supplementing medicine be administered. Since they arise from vacuity, hot formulas must be avoided; if heat is introduced, vacuity will worsen, and the heat will readily damage the bone membrane. Exercise utmost caution.\n\n**Abscesses at the Hairline**\nThese abscesses arise at the hairline on either side of the nape. Urgent topical treatment is required. If they present as kernels, the root must be promptly excised. If they resemble brain-heart abscesses, heat qi ascends to attack the brain, causing redness, swelling, hardness, and pain around the ears and neck, accompanied by chills and fever. Without swift treatment, the toxin will enter the blood, causing flesh to rot and pus to form. If blood and qi emerge from the head, or if phlegm is involved, it is nearly incurable and fatal.\n\n**Occipital Abscess**\nThis condition, called *Heavenly Flat Abscess*, presents as large and purplish-black. Without urgent treatment, heat will penetrate the armpit, injure the Conception Vessel, and internally scorch the liver and lungs, leading to death within ten days.\n\nApply the previously mentioned *Dissolve Toxin and Reduce Swelling Supportive Powder* and *Internal Support Thousand Gold Powder*, along with *Promote Flesh Growth and Relieve Pain* remedies to achieve efficacy.\n\n**Postauricular Abscess**\nThis condition arises one *cun* and three *fen* behind the ear—a fatal location. If it develops, it is invariably fatal, hence termed *Acute Toxin* and left untreated. *Acute Toxin* presents as firm and sharply toxic, called *Mandibular Swelling*. When heat steams upward, connecting to the jaw and penetrating the mouth, it inevitably leads to throat perforation and death.\n\nPrescribed remedies follow.\n\n**Break Binding Powder**\nSpecifically treats *stone goiter*, *qi goiter*, *sinew goiter*, *blood goiter*, and similar conditions. Administer this remedy promptly, along with subsequent topical applications.\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Sargassum* (washed) – 3 *qian*\n- *Gentiana* – 3 *qian*\n- *Clam shell* – 3 *qian*\n- *Rice-paper plant pith* – 3 *qian*\n- *Fritillaria* (heart removed) – 3 *qian*\n- *Kelp* (washed) – 3 *qian*\n- *Alum* (calcined) – 3 *qian*\n- *Usnea* – 3 *qian*\n- *Wheat flour* – 1 *qian*\n- *Pinellia* – 1 *qian*\n\nGrind all into fine powder. Take half a *qian* per dose, mixed with warm southern wine. Avoid all toxic substances, licorice, chicken, fish, the five pungent vegetables, raw or cold fruits, and trees for efficacy.\n\n**Arisaema Paste**\nSpecifically treats skin growths and tumors on the neck and face, ranging from fist-sized to millet-sized, whether soft or hard, painless or indolent. Apply this remedy—do not rashly use acupuncture or moxibustion. Instead, carefully puncture to release qi, then apply the paste.\n*Ingredients:*\n- One large *Arisaema* (finely ground until dry; add quality vinegar to form a paste. If fresh is unavailable, dried may be used—grind into powder and mix with vinegar to form a paste).\n\nPuncture the growth slightly to allow qi to escape, then spread the paste on paper, cut to the size of the tumor, and apply. If itching occurs, do not scratch; reapply frequently for efficacy. When the paper dries, replace with a moistened application.\n\n**Chest Abscess**\nThis condition, called *Well Abscess*, arises on the chest, resembling a large bean, and develops within three to four days. Without early treatment, it descends into the abdomen. If it enters the abdomen and remains untreated, death occurs within ten days. Urgently administer *Internal Consolidation and Clear Heart Powder* (formula as previously noted). External manifestations are treatable; internal penetration injures the membranes and is undoubtedly fatal.\n\n**Nine Abscesses**\nThese include *lung abscess*, *heart abscess*, *liver abscess*, *kidney carbuncle*, *spleen abscess*, *stomach abscess*, *large intestine abscess*, *triple burner abscess*, and *small intestine carbuncle*. Examine the patient’s membranes, assess the abscess’s depth, determine the affected organ or bowel, and identify any prior consumption of mineral or stone medicines. Evaluate qi deficiency or excess—external perforation and drainage are treatable, while internal membrane injury with pus discharging through the stool is nearly incurable. Treat accordingly.\n\n**Breast Abscess in Women**\nFor *breast carbuncle*, if occurring postpartum, it is called *external blowing*; if during pregnancy, *internal blowing*. Initially, apply topical powders for urgent treatment. If pus forms, use *Promote Flesh Growth and Relieve Pain* remedies for efficacy.\n\n**Efficacy Powder**\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Angelica dahurica* – equal parts\n- *Fritillaria* (heart removed) – equal parts\n\nGrind into fine powder and take with southern wine. For blocked lactation, add *Rhaponticum* and decoct with wine for administration.\n\n**Topical Remedy for Initial Breast Abscess and Internal/External Blowing**\nUse one spoonful of yeast, mix with five *qian* of flour, stir-fry and grind until fermented dough resembles a beehive. Once fermentation turns the surface green, dry and grind into powder. Mix with well water and apply. If dry, moisten day and night. If unresolved, add *Angelica dahurica* and *Fritillaria* powder. For pain, add *Frankincense* and *Myrrh* powder for immediate efficacy.\n\nFor *breast carbuncle* and *breast abscess* with internal nodules that do not dissipate, urgently administer *Restore Origin and Unblock Qi Powder*, along with previously mentioned topical remedies, *Dissolve Toxin and Draw Out Toxin Powders*, and *Life-Saving Decoction* until sweating occurs.\n\n**Restore Origin and Unblock Qi Powder**\nTreats *breast abscess*, *breast carbuncle*, and all swelling toxins.\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Aucklandia* – equal parts\n- *Fennel* – equal parts\n- *Unripe tangerine peel* – equal parts\n- *Pangolin scales* (roasted until crisp) – equal parts\n- *Tangerine peel* – equal parts\n- *Angelica dahurica* – equal parts\n- *Licorice* – equal parts\n- *Fritillaria* (ginger-processed, heart removed) – equal parts\n- *Rhaponticum* – added\n\nGrind all into powder and take with southern wine. Alternatively, decoct with water and add wine for administration.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Unripe tangerine peel* – 1 *liang*\n- *Tangerine peel* – 1 *liang*\n- *Licorice* (raw and prepared) – 1 *liang*\n- *Pangolin scales* (roasted) – 3 *liang*\n- *Trichosanthes root* – 3 *liang*\n- *Forsythia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Honeysuckle* – 1 *liang*\n\nGrind all into powder and take with hot wine.\n\n**Breast Consumption**\nAvoid needling, as injury to the mammary ducts is fatal. Identify the condition: if the mouth opens wide, the breast is damaged and decayed. Urgently administer remedies and apply topical treatments. Failure to promote flesh growth is fatal and untreatable. Administer *Secret Transmission Flow Qi Decoction* and *Supportive Ten Proclamations Powder*, with *Dissolve Toxin, Promote Flesh Growth, and Relieve Pain Powder* applied centrally, and the previous *blowing breast* topical remedy applied around the perimeter.\n\nFor *flowering* or *pomegranate* breast abscesses, these conditions are untreatable. Those aged thirty-two or thirty-three may be treated; those over forty should seek early treatment with oral and topical remedies. Failure to promote flesh growth renders the condition untreatable and fatal.\n\n**Human Face Sore**\nThis condition arises from karmic retribution. Perform virtuous deeds to resolve it, with sincere repentance. Only then may remedies be applied. Administer *Flow Qi Decoction*; for chronic cases, take *Sophora Pill* to supplement kidney water. Apply *Dissolve Toxin, Promote Flesh Growth, and Relieve Pain Powder* for miraculous efficacy. Later, use plasters and flesh-promoting remedies to fill the sore.\n\n**Sophora Pill**\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Sophora* – 4 *liang*\n- *Saposhnikovia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Schizonepeta* – 1 *liang*\n- *Angelica dahurica* – 1 *liang*\n- *Sichuan aconite* (raw, skin removed) – 1 *liang*\n- *Red peony* – 1 *liang*\n- *Fleeceflower root* – 1 *liang*\n- *Ligusticum* – 1 *liang*\n- *Notopterygium* – 1 *liang*\n- *Gardenia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Gleditsia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Vitex* – 1 *liang*\n- *Poria* – 1 *liang*\n- *Dioscorea* – 1 *liang*\n- *Tribulus* – 3 *liang*\n- *Aconite* (stir-fried) – 3 *qian*\n- *Astragalus* – 1 *liang*\n- *Notopterygium* – 1 *liang*\n- *Typhonium* – 1 *liang* (these four ingredients are called *Four Fresh Powder*; only 3 *qian* of *Aconite* is used)\n\nGrind the above ingredients into a fine powder, mix with water and cooked wheat flour paste to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take thirty to fifty pills per dose, two or three times daily, on an empty stomach, swallowed with warm southern wine. For those who do not drink wine, substitute with good tea. This tonifies Kidney Water.\n\n**Chronic Outer Shin Sores**\nFor sores that persist for years without healing, this is often due to Kidney Water deficiency and downward collapse, or Spleen dampness overflowing. Take *Sophora Pill* to tonify Kidney Water, and apply *Toxin-Resolving, Flesh-Promoting, Pain-Relieving Powder*. Later, use *Interlayer Plaster*.\n\n**Secret Transmission: Interlayer Plaster**\nFor chronic, long-standing shin sores that do not heal:\n- *Old pine resin*\n- *Camphor*\n- *Milled lead* (stir-fried)\n- *Water dragon bone* (i.e., ship’s red lime)\n- *Calomel*\n\nIf unresolved, add:\n- *Angelica dahurica*\n- *Ligusticum*\n- *Mantis egg-case*\n\nGrind all into a fine powder. Melt the pine resin, add a small amount of clear oil, and mix. Prepare oil-paper bags according to the size of the sore, fill with the medicament, and bind over the wound after washing. Secure for two days; replace every four days.\n\nAlternatively, decoct *Angelica dahurica*, *Ligusticum*, and *mantis egg-case* alone to wash the sore—also effective.\n\n**Calf Abscess and Blood-Wind Sores**\nFor these two conditions:\n- If an abscess or deep-rooted sore arises on the calf, those near the genitals or anus are difficult to treat; those on fleshy areas are easier to resolve.\n- For men and women with *blood-wind sores* on the legs, if the condition flows downward, it is manageable; if it ascends to the hands, it is difficult to treat.\n\n**Dorsal Foot Sores**\nThis condition arises from *wasting-thirst* (diabetes). When it appears on the toes, it is called *gangrenous detachment*. If the sore turns red-black, it is fatal and untreatable; if not red-black, it may be treated. If treatment fails to improve it, amputate immediately—this may save the patient. Failure to amputate will lead to red-black necrosis and certain death.\n\nAt onset, it may be treated: administer *Qi-Coursing Beverage*, *Sophora Pill*, and *Toxin-Resolving, Flesh-Promoting Medicines* with urgency. Another specific remedy: boil *tung oil* and *litharge* to a boil, add a spoonful of *Sichuan pepper*, and cut *water bamboo leaves* to fit the sore. Steep for seven days, then apply the leaves alone to the sore—this will resolve it. For sores on the fingers, use the same treatment.\n\n**Kidney Yin Abscess**\nThis condition, called *suspended abscess*, manifests as swelling and pain on the scrotum. It arises when the Bladder and Kidney channels are affected by cold-damp *qi*, causing stagnation in the Yin meridians, blood and *qi* congealing, and cold-damp *qi* failing to disperse.\n\nAdminister the aforementioned *Supportive Wrapping Powder*, adding:\n- *Plantago seed*\n- *Akebia*\n- *Bland bamboo leaf*\n- *Morning glory*\n- *Fleeceflower root*\n- *Lotus stamen*\n\nAlso apply *Internal Dissipation Powder* and *Flesh-Promoting, Pain-Relieving Powder*, and cover with a plaster. Further, take the previously mentioned *Secret Transmission: Qi-Coursing Beverage*.\n\n**Lower Abscesses**\n*Secret Transmission: One-Ingredient Thousand-Gold Powder*—specifically for *scrofula*—works with miraculous efficacy. Use a single black spider (those that cross rivers are best), crush in a bowl, stir with hot southern wine, and consume in one draught. Lie on the side corresponding to the affected area. If unresolved, use another spider—this will be effective.\n\n**Topical Medicines**\nFirst, stir-fry scallion whites until hot and apply as a compress. If cooling occurs, reheat and apply three or four times. Then apply the medicine: use the aforementioned *Toxin-Transforming, Swelling-Reducing Medicine*, adding:\n- *Garlic*\n- *Momordica*\n- *Arisaema*\n- *Wild aconite*\n\nFor ruptured sores, use the aforementioned *Flesh-Promoting, Pain-Relieving Medicine*.

If unresolved, take one or two more doses.\n\nAnother formula: decoct *chestnut tree root* in southern wine—this works immediately.\n\n**Chancre Topical Medicine**\n- *Coptis*\n- *Phellodendron* (equal parts)\n\nFirst, soak the two ingredients in the juice of two pig gallbladders until moist. Then place on a tile or brick heated over fire to dry. Add:\n- *Frankincense*\n- *Myrrh*\n- *Mirabilite*\n- *Calcined alum*\n- *Litharge*\n- *Chinese sumac gallnut*\n- *Scorpion*\n- *Sophora*\n\nGrind into powder.

Each dose weighs five *qian*. For the first dose, add *lycopus leaf* and a small amount of *honeysuckle* (one *qian* each), along with one *liang* of fresh ginger. Pound together, then decoct with good wine and consume hot. For those who do not drink, decoct with water and a small amount of wine—this is also effective. Then decoct one and a half cups each of wine and water with ten slices of ginger, consume hot, and cover with clothing and bedding until sweating occurs. Once the condition improves, add two *qian* of *rhubarb* to the previous formula, decoct hot, and consume. Purging once or twice will eliminate residual toxins.\n\nThough the formula’s ingredients may seem incongruous, repeated use has proven its efficacy without fail. If other symptoms arise, adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nFor vexation and vomiting, add one *qian* of *licorice node* and take with fermented bean curd water (ingredients above ground separately into powder).\nFor retching and nausea, add *frankincense* and take with *licorice* decoction mixed with bean powder.

Upon consumption, a head will form; if painless, it will induce pain; if already formed, it will resolve immediately. This is the supreme treasure among remedies for malignant conditions—even in critical cases, it may be used without fail. Do not underestimate it.\n\n- *Toad venom* (two *qian*, dried; dissolve in aged wine)\n- *Dragon’s blood* (one *qian*)\n- *Frankincense* (two *qian*)\n- *Myrrh* (two *qian*)\n- *Realgar* (three *qian*)\n- *Calomel* (half a *qian*)\n- *Chalcanthite* (one *qian*)\n- *Musk* (half a *qian*)\n- *Verdigris* (two *qian*)\n- *Calcium sulfate* (one *qian*)\n- *Cinnabar* (two *qian*, for coating)\n- *Sea snails* (twenty-one, with shells)\n- *Centipede* (one, wine-fried until yellow; remove head, feet, and brain; half a *qian*; omit if unavailable)\n\nGrind all into fine powder, then grind the *sea snails* into a paste and mix with the previous ingredients to form pills the size of mung beans. If pills do not form, use wine-cooked flour paste. Each dose consists of only two pills. Have the patient chew three inches of *scallion white* until pulpy, then spit into the palm (left for men, right for women). Wrap the pills in the scallion and swallow with three to four cups of unfiltered hot wine. Rest in a draft-free area, covered with clothing and bedding. After the time it takes to walk five *li*, consume several more cups of hot wine to reinforce the medicine’s power. Profuse sweating is the desired effect. If sweating does not occur in severe cases, take two more pills. Sweating will then ensue, and the effect will be achieved. At the first sign of illness, two pills will resolve it; for severe cases of three to five days’ duration, take two more pills. If the *ding*-sore has *walked yellow* and reached the heart, it is difficult to treat. If cold sweats occur, the patient will die. If the patient cannot chew scallion, pound it and wrap the pills for swallowing with wine. For sores on the upper body, take after meals; for sores on the lower body, take before meals. After consumption, avoid cold water, cucumber, eggplant, oily noodles, pork, mutton, offal, fish, and all wind- and sore-provoking foods, as well as women’s laundry with fox odor. This remedy is infallible.\n\n**Back Sore Formula**\n- *Cephalonoplos* (one *liang*)\n- *Oxalis* (half a *liang*)\n- *Chinese angelica* (two and a half *qian*)\n- *Frankincense* (one and a quarter *qian*)\n- *Myrrh* (one and a quarter *qian*)\n\nDry by baking, grind into powder, and take seven *qian* per dose, mixed with hot wine.\n\nIf fresh herbs are available, grind them with wine and take warm, reserving the dregs to apply on the sore.\n\n**For Lumbar Pain:**\nStir-fry black soybeans until hot, wrap in silk or cloth, and bind around the waist. Grind ginger into hot wine and drink until intoxicated, inducing sweating. If no sweat appears, repeat the process two or three times for certain efficacy.\n\n**Cane Wound Formula:**\n- *Hydrargyrum chloratum* (one *liang*)\n- *Red halloysite* (one *qian*, raw)\n- *Mercury* (one *fen*, pre-melted)\n\nGrind the three ingredients with sesame oil into a paste, spread on umbrella paper, and apply to the wound, binding tightly. If the flesh is sunken, fill the cavity with this paste before applying for immediate effect. Also treats hemorrhoids and malignant tinea.\n\n**Hemorrhoid Formula:**\n- *Arsenic* (*xin*)\n- *Licorice*\n- *Alum* (raw)\n\nGrind each into powder. In a bowl, layer *arsenic* powder first, then *licorice* powder, followed by *alum* powder. Calcine over fire, then repeat the layering and calcining three times. Sweep the resulting powder into a container, mix with cold water, and apply to the sore. Some pain is unavoidable; drink wine until intoxicated. By the next day, the sore will slough off.\n\n**To Extract Boils:**\nFor any boil that does not emerge, use half a *Ba dou* kernel (shelled), grind with magnetite into powder, and mix with scallion saliva and honey into a paste. Apply to the sore, and the boil will emerge.\n\n**For All Swellings and Toxins:**\nUse ginger dough made from wheat flour and earth collected from the eastern side of a beam where it meets the ground. On a yang day, draw a circle (○) on the ground; on a yin day, draw a square (□). Dip ginger in fine rice vinegar and grind within the circle to collect earth. Place in a mortar, add *rhubarb* and *mirabilite* powder, and grind thoroughly with ginger. Apply to the toxic area, leaving the sore’s opening exposed; the toxin will discharge.\n\n**Decaying Sores (Zhu Gan):**\nMix *calomel* and *Sháo fěn* for application. Also treats mild tinea.\n\n**Scabies Formula:**\n- *Hydnocarpus*\n- *Coptis*\n- *Licorice*\n- *Oil walnut* (adjust quantity)\n- *Elm bark*\n- *Zanthoxylum*\n- *Calomel*\n- *Alum* (half raw, half calcined)\n- *Cnidium*\n- *Well-spring stone*\n\nGrind each into powder, mix with oil walnut, and pound into a paste the size of a bullet. Wrap in coarse cloth and rub: for itching areas, scrub; for painful areas, press. The remedy takes effect upon application.\n\n**Infantile Milk Tinea:**\nRub with *licorice powder*, then apply oil and soy paste.\n\n**Acute and Chronic Convulsions:**\nAdminister a mouthful of clear water from a cold latrine pit for immediate cure.\n\n*End of Scroll Nine of* **Immortal-Transmitted External Medicine Secret Formulas**\n\n*Scroll Ten of* **Immortal-Transmitted External Medicine Secret Formulas**\n*Compiled by Zhao Yizhen, the Yuanyang Master of Junyi*\n\n**Treatise on Miscellaneous Conditions**\n\n**Rescuing the Hanged:**\nFrom dawn to dusk, even if the body is already cold, life may still be restored. If the region below the heart retains the slightest warmth, even after a full day, revival is possible. Immediately embrace the deceased to loosen the noose, remove the rope—*never cut it*. Gently adjust the throat to its proper position, lay the body flat, and cover with a quilt. Urgently blow into both ears through bamboo tubes. Have one person firmly grasp the hair without releasing, while stepping on both shoulders with the feet. Another should massage the chest and flex the limbs, kneading and stretching them. If revived, administer thin congee. This method revives all without fail.\n\n**Rescuing the Drowned:**\nFirst, pry open the drowned person’s mouth with a knife and place a chopstick horizontally between the teeth to allow water to drain. Alternatively, invert a jar or steamer, lay the drowned person’s abdomen over it, letting the head hang downward to expel water. If no jar or steamer is available, a round log may be used. After water is expelled, have a strong man carry the deceased on his back, with the legs draped over the shoulders, walking to force out all remaining water. Then, take a clod of wall earth, place it on the ground, and lay the drowned person supine upon it, covering the body with more wall earth—leaving only the mouth and eyes exposed. Naturally, the water’s qi will be absorbed into the earth, and the person may revive. Immediately blow alternately into the mouth, ears, nose, navel, and anus through bamboo tubes to restore the flow of qi between upper and lower. Also, insufflate a small amount of *pinellia* powder into the nostrils. If slightly revived, administer thin congee.\n\nAnother method from Sun Simiao for rescuing the drowned: urgently loosen the deceased’s clothing and sash, then apply moxa to the navel to revive.\n\n**Rescuing Those Frozen in Winter After Falling into Water:**\nIf the limbs are cold, speech is lost, and only faint breath remains, do not immediately apply fire. Instead, fill a cloth bag with hot ashes and place it over the heart. Replace with fresh hot ashes as it cools. Once the eyes open, administer warm wine or rice broth.\n\n**Rescuing Those Who Have Collapsed from Summer Heat:**\nDo not expose to cold, for cold will cause death. Use warm water to continuously massage and wash the area between the heart and abdomen. If urgently needed on the road, place hot roadside earth over the abdomen and navel, and have someone urinate into the navel to revive.\n\n**Rescuing Those Who Have Collapsed from Heatstroke and Thirst:**\nMash equal parts of hot roadside earth and garlic, mix with water, strain, and administer the liquid to revive.\n\n**Rescuing Sudden Windstroke with Loss of Consciousness, Often Due to Phlegm Obstruction:**\nUse two *qian* of raw *alunite*, ground into powder, and mixed with fresh ginger juice. Pry open the mouth and administer to induce drooling, either by vomiting or dissolution, to restore consciousness.\n\n**Rescuing Sudden Collapse from Malevolent Qi with Loss of Consciousness:**\nGrind leeks into juice and pour into the nostrils.\n\n**Rescuing Those Who Appear Dead While Asleep:**\nDrip leek juice into the nostrils. In winter, use leeks with roots, pound into juice, and administer.\n\n**Treating Falls from Heights with Blood Stasis Attacking the Heart and Near-Death:**\nBoil one large cup of *fermented soybean* in two bowls of water for three boils, strain, and administer. If the person suddenly loses breath and speech before the medicine can be prepared, pry open the mouth and pour in warm urine.\n\n**For the Five Sudden Deaths—Crushed, Hanged, Drowned, Nightmare-Induced, or Postpartum Collapse:**\nUse *pinellia* ground into a powder the size of a soybean and insufflate into the nostrils to revive instantly.\n\n**Hua Tuo, the Divine Physician, said:**\nTen critical conditions strike as swiftly as wind and rain; thus, select these renowned formulas to rescue them.\n\n**First Critical Condition: Cholera with Vomiting and Diarrhea**\nCaused by cold drinks, exposure to cold, hunger, rage, or travel by cart or boat, which injures the stomach qi, leading to incessant vomiting and diarrhea, dizziness, blurred vision, muscle spasms, and cold limbs.\n*Formula:*\n- *Evodia* (half *liang*)\n- *Chaenomeles* (half *liang*)\n- *Fermented soybean* (half *liang*)\n\nStir-fry together until scorched.

First apply heated salt to the *Qihai* point below the navel, ensuring the warmth is retained.\n\n**Eighth Critical Condition: Ghostly Nightmare or Ghostly Assault**\nStruck by a ghost in the bedchamber, making sounds and crying out without awareness.\n*Formula:* Crush *zaoxintu* (hearth soil) into powder, take two *qian* per dose with freshly drawn water, and blow a half-fingernail’s pinch into the nostrils.

She should remain active and composed. If the infant is fully developed, it will emerge naturally when the qi is sufficient. Premature induction risks transverse or breech birth, leading to fatal complications—such self-inflicted harm is avoidable. Verified formulas follow.\n\n**Purple Perilla Drink**\nTreats all prenatal conditions in women. This formula both calms and induces labor, pacifying the fetus and regulating qi—its efficacy is profound and indescribable.\n*Ingredients:*\n- Purple perilla leaves, 1 *liang* (fire-dried)\n- Areca peel, washed and dried, stir-fried with fresh ginger juice\n- Ginseng, ½ *liang*\n- Aged tangerine peel, ½ *liang* (remove pith, stir-fried)\n- *Chuanxiong*, 8 *qian*\n- Licorice, ½ *liang* (honey-fried)\n- Northern white peony, 4 *qian* (lightly stir-fried)\n- *Chuandanggui*, 1 *liang* (lightly stir-fried)\n\n*Preparation:* Chop the ingredients.

Take once daily. At labor, decoct with downstream water.\n*When labor pains begin in waves:* Grind a piece of high-quality *ruxiang* (frankincense) the size of a little finger into a thick paste with 1 *ge* of water, administer warm, and wait until the waters break before taking labor-inducing drugs.\n\n**Labor-Inducing Formula**\n*Ingredients:* One handful of *zuosheng* branches (one *chi* long, thoroughly washed) and a five-inch piece of licorice, both chopped.\n*Preparation:* Decoct in seven bowls of water in an earthenware pot, seal tightly with paper, and simmer until reduced by half. When the mother’s labor pains intensify, administer one cup warm. No more than two doses are needed; a sensation of downward pressure signals imminent delivery.\n*This formula also treats transverse or breech birth, retained stillborn fetus with putrefaction, or prolonged retention. Repeatedly verified.*\n*Alternative Formula:* Mix equal parts *baicaoshuang* (soot from kitchen stoves) and *baizhi* into powder, knead with boy’s urine and a little vinegar into a paste, and administer with hot water.\n*Another Formula:* Burn the wooden shavings from an axe’s eye (where the handle fits) to ash, and administer with swiftly flowing water.\n*For retained placenta pressing against the heart:* Burn snake skin to ash, mix with a small amount of musk, grind finely, and administer with warm wine for immediate delivery.\n\n**Retained Placenta**\n*Formula:* Separate the whites from three eggs, mix with 1 *ge* of sour vinegar, and have the woman sip it to expel the placenta.\n*Alternative Method:* Have the woman hold the end of her own hair in her mouth to induce retching, prompting expulsion.\n*Another Formula:* Peel and grind fourteen castor beans, apply the paste to the soles of her feet, and the placenta will descend. Wash off immediately. If the uterus prolapses, apply the same paste to the crown of the head to retract it. This remedy is harmless if used repeatedly; wash off once the uterus returns.\n\n**Postpartum Blood Surge**\nWhen stagnant blood rushes upward, causing blood faint (resembling sudden death), decoct aged mugwort in water with vinegar and administer.\n\n**Uterine Flooding**\n*Formula:* Grind *huangqin* into powder, take 2 *qian* per dose with wine heated by a red-hot iron scale weight.\n*Alternative Formula:* Burn lotus seedpods to ash, take 2 *qian* per dose with wine.\n*Another Formula:* Burn cotton, palm fiber, and hair to ash, mix with *baicaoshuang*, grind into powder, and administer with ash-free wine.\n\n**Jiyin Elixir**\nTreats all women’s ailments.\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Xiangfuzhi* (nutgrass)\n- Black soybeans\n- Dried ginger\n- *Cangzhu* (atractylodes)\n\n*Preparation:* Weigh four *liang* of each.

If offered tea, wine, or food, stealthily pluck a single pubic hair with your left hand, place it on the plate, and return it to the host. Silently recite the incantation 3 times as before. If a poisoned plate is present, creatures will emerge—tie them with the hair to identify the afflicted host.\n\n*Alternative Formula: Filth Powder*\nHave the patient chew a piece of *baifan* (alum). If it tastes sweet, *gu* toxin is present.

Cease when heat penetrates the abdomen, regardless of the number of cones used. After moxibustion, wipe the area with a warm, damp cloth to remove toxins. This method has repeatedly saved lives.\n\n**Treating Malaria**\nTake 7 *qian* of *haochangshan* (dichroa root) and 3 *qian* of *binglang* (areca nut). Grind into fine powder, mix with egg white, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take 30 pills per dose with warm wine or vinegar decoction. Administer once the night before onset and again at dawn on the day of onset—highly effective. For chronic cases, increase dosage to achieve results.\n\nAnother method: Slice *changshan* (dichroa root), mix thoroughly with egg white, steam over rice three times, discard the egg white, dry the *changshan* in the sun, grind into powder, and form into pills with cooked rice. Take 20 pills before bed and at dawn with wine—cures without inducing vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nAnother remedy: *Qinghao* (sweet wormwood) and *bo gui* (thin cinnamon bark), each ground into powder. For predominantly cold malaria, use more cinnamon and less wormwood; for predominantly hot malaria, use more wormwood and less cinnamon. Pound 2 *liang* of fresh ginger (with skin) to extract juice, mix with hot wine, and consume. Cover with blankets and rest to recover.\n\nAnother method: Regardless of chronic or recent onset, highly effective. Take 1 *liang* of *changshan* (dichroa root), thin as chicken bones, chop, soak in good vinegar overnight, then cook in an earthenware vessel until dry. Grind into powder, take 2 *qian* per dose, decoct in 1 cup of water until reduced to half, strain, and cool. Administer at dawn—divinely effective without inducing vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nAnother remedy: Equal parts *zhimu* (anemarrhena), *beimu* (fritillaria), *changshan* (dichroa root), and *binglang* (areca nut). Chop, decoct in equal parts water and wine until reduced to half, strain, cover with silk, and expose to dew overnight. At dawn, consume cold while facing east. Effective for all types of malaria, even chronic cases unresponsive for years—relief after one dose. However, women must not prepare the decoction.\n\n**Treating Red and White Dysentery**\nTake 6 *hezi* (chebula fruit), roast 6 until cooked and use 6 raw. Remove pits, dry the flesh, and grind into powder. For red dysentery, take with a decoction of raw *gancao* (licorice); for white dysentery, take with a decoction of roasted *gancao*.

Divine efficacy beyond description.\n\n**Treating Aphthous Dysentery**\nThis condition may be cold, hot, or a mix of both. First disperse exterior and interior conditions. If palms are hot and eyes red, it is heat—use *Baidu San* (Antiphlogistic Powder) with *chenmi* (aged rice) decoction. If palms are cold and pure white dysentery occurs, it is cold—grind *lianrou* (lotus seed, with heart intact) into powder, mix with rice water, and take 3 *qian* per dose. Once able to eat, treat according to cold or heat symptoms.\n\nAnother remedy: Use *hongmujin* flowers (without stems), dry in shade, and grind into powder.

For *yin sha* (cold colic), the abdomen hurts and limbs are cold. Locate red spots on the body and burn them with an oil-dipped rush wick. For *yang sha* (hot colic), the abdomen hurts and limbs are warm. Prick the back of the fingers near the nails (about 1.5 *fen*) where the skin moves—bleeding brings relief. First, massage both arms downward to gather stagnant blood at the fingertips for bleeding.\n\nIf pain is unbearable and risks death (anciently called \"dry cholera\"), urgently dissolve 1 *liang* of salt in hot water and pour into the patient’s mouth—relief comes when salt reaches the abdomen.\n\nAnother remedy: Stir-fry stones until red, quench in cold water, and drink 1–2 *ge* of the clear liquid.\n\nAnother remedy: Equal parts *chenzhangmu* (aged camphor wood), *chenpi* (aged tangerine peel), and *chenbitutu* (aged wall earth).

Take on an empty stomach.\n\n**Moxibustion Method for Early-Stage Carbuncles and Back Boils (Repeatedly Tested and Verified)**\nAt the first sign of a carbuncle or back boil—whether already formed or not—if there is redness, heat, swelling, and pain, cover the area with damp paper and observe where it dries first; this marks the head of the boil. Slice a large garlic clove into pieces the thickness of a *dang* coin (approx. 3 *qian*), place one slice on the head, and apply moxibustion with three *zhuang* of mugwort. Replace the garlic slice and continue moxibustion: if painful, moxa until pain ceases; if painless, moxa until pain arises. Early detection and prompt moxibustion yield the best results. For boils present one or two days, ten moxibustions cure ten cases; for three or four days, six or seven cures; for five or six days, three or four cures. After seven days, moxibustion is no longer effective. If multiple heads cluster in one area, grind garlic into a paste, form a cake, place it over the boil heads, and burn mugwort atop it—this will also bring relief. If a red swelling on the back contains a yellow kernel like a millet grain, slice a single garlic clove and apply moxibustion as above; the next day, remove the scab, and the pus will have already discharged.\n\n**Bamboo Tube Suction Method for Toxins (Effective for All Malignant Sores)**\nSelect a section of bitter bamboo one to two *cun* long, preferably with a node at one end. Scrape the green outer layer until paper-thin, adjusting the tube’s size to match the sore. Best used at the onset of toxic sores.\n**Ingredients:**\n- *Baijili* (white caltrop) – 5 *qian*\n- *Cangzhu* (atractylodes) – 5 *qian*\n- *Wujupi* (Chinese tallow tree bark) – 5 *qian*\n- *Houpo* (magnolia bark) – 5 *qian*\n\nChop the four ingredients, decoct with the bamboo tube in one *diao* of water until the medicine is exhausted. While the tube is hot, press it onto the sore; soon, it will adhere on its own without manual pressure. Prepare another tube with the same proportions of medicine. When the first tube cools, remove it and replace it with a hot one, repeating the process. The pus will be drawn into the tube, and the sore will heal.\n\n**Tenfold Diffusion Powder for Carbuncles and Boils**\nAll carbuncles and boils arise from stagnation of qi and blood, obstruction by wind-toxins. This formula disperses wind-evil, promotes the flow of qi and blood, drains pus, relieves pain, generates flesh, and closes wounds. For unformed sores, it swiftly dissipates them; for formed sores, it hastens suppuration. Without testing the five toxins, one may still achieve efficacy.\nMaster Xu states: Once, a patient with a back sore failed to heal with various medicines. This formula was administered—five to six *qian* dissolved in one *sheng* of warm wine. Shortly after, the pain diminished by seventy percent. After several doses, the sore suppurated, and within half a month, the wound closed. Another case involved a woman with a bowl-sized swelling on her thigh, which resolved with this treatment. A patient with a cranial boil took the medicine, drank to intoxication, and slept; upon waking, the ailment was gone. The key lies in selecting high-quality ingredients and administering ample doses. Continue taking the medicine even after the wound closes to replenish prior depletion and prevent future recurrence. For those who do not drink, it may also be taken with a thick decoction of *muxiang* (costus root), though a small amount of wine is preferable.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- *Renshen* (ginseng, preferably from Silla) – remove the root head, finely chop, and dry-fry\n- *Danggui* (Chinese angelica, large Sichuan variety resembling a horse’s tail) – wash thoroughly, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Huangqi* (astragalus, silky variety, unbranched like an arrow shaft over a *chi* long) – wash, cut into *cun* sections, crush, split into strands, soak in saltwater until saturated, then gently roast until supple, and slice\n- *Chuanxiong* (Sichuan lovage, high-quality) – wash, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Fangfeng* (saposhnikovia, freshly fragrant) – wash, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Houpo* (magnolia bark, thick and purple) – remove coarse bark, soak in ginger juice overnight, then stir-fry and dry-fry\n- *Gancao* (licorice)\n- *Jiegeng* (platycodon, with a bitter-tasting core) – wash, remove root head, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Baizhi* (angelica dahurica)\n- *Rougui* (cinnamon, thinly rolled) – remove coarse bark, avoid fire exposure\n\nTake the first nine ingredients in their purest, driest form, weigh, and grind into powder. *Renshen*, *danggui*, and *huangqi* each use two *liang*; the remaining seven ingredients each use one *liang*. Add *rougui* and blend evenly. Dosage: three *qian*, increasing to five or six *qian*. Purchase ample *rougui*, remove impurities, and weigh the pure powder. With sincere preparation and generous dosing, efficacy is assured.\n\n**Yellow Wax Pill for Back Boils, Carbuncles, and All Malignant Sores**\nA patient with sores resembling snake heads covering the body also found relief with this remedy.\nUse any amount of raw *baifan* (alum), grind into powder, and for every *liang* of alum, melt seven *qian* of yellow wax (remove from heat before mixing). Combine evenly and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Dosage: ten to twenty or thirty pills, taken at any time with rice water or warm boiled water. For unruptured sores, it resolves them internally; for ruptured sores, it promotes closure. Typically, efficacy is achieved within ten or so doses. For sores caused by mineral or metal drug toxicity, this remedy is also suitable. Alternatively, take one to two spoonfuls of raw alum powder with warm water—equally effective. Use mountain wax, yellow in color, for best results. This formula does not disturb the viscera, relieves pain, and is safe for the elderly, weak, or infirm. It powerfully protects the membranes, rescues the heart, and prevents heat-toxin from attacking internally, averting critical danger. Its wonders are beyond description.\n\n**Oak Leaf Decoction for Back Boils and Carbuncles (Formed or Unformed)**\nSimple, inexpensive, and ideal for aiding the poor.\n**Ingredients:**\n- Dried oak leaves – 4 *liang*\n- Dried lotus leaf heart and stem – 1 *liang*\n- *Xuancaogen* (daylily root) – 1 *liang*\n- *Gancaojie* (licorice nodes) – 1 *liang*\n- *Diyu* (burnet) – 1 *liang*\n\nChop into a powder. Dosage: half a *liang* per serving, decoct in two bowls of water until reduced to half a bowl, and divide into two doses. Take morning and evening until the condition resolves. For formed sores, it promotes suppuration; for unformed sores, it induces resolution. Avoid all toxic foods.\n\n**Additional Remedy for Carbuncles and Boils**\nGrind *jilongying* leaves (from a chicken coop) into a paste, add a small amount of *guan* (salt), and apply, leaving the boil head exposed—immediately effective.\n\n**Treatment for Scrofula (Regardless of Ruptured or Unruptured)**\nPierce the top of a black chicken egg, stir the yolk and white evenly, then tie a *banmao* (blister beetle) with string—removing its head, wings, and legs—and insert it into the egg.

Soak in a latrine pit for one month, then transfer to flowing water for another month—never use stagnant water. Remove the palm fiber, dry in the sun (do not bake), and grind into fine powder. For each *liang* of *zaojiao* powder, add half a *qian* of *shexiang* (musk) and seven whole scorpions; grind finely and blend evenly. Take two *qian* per dose, mixed with warm wine or water as preferred. Recovery typically occurs after consuming no more than two to three *liang*.\n\n**Treatment for Nail-like Sores (Dingchuang)**\nFor unruptured *dingchuang* (nail-like sores), where the poison risks entering the intestines and stomach, use *chantui* (cicada moltings) ground into powder. Mix half a bowl with honey water and drink, and apply the powder mixed with saliva to the sore—its opening will naturally rupture.\n\n**Alternative Remedy**\nTake three or four *wumei* (dark plums), remove the flesh, mash, and bind tightly over the sore with silk. Then crush *juhua* (chrysanthemum) leaves, stems, and roots with wine and drink; for those who do not drink, use a decoction. By the following evening, remove the plum—the sore will have ruptured.\n\n**Another Remedy**\nGrind fresh honey with year-old scallions into a paste. First pierce the sore, then apply the paste, securing it with cloth. After the time it takes to walk five *li*, the *ding* (core) will emerge; wash it away with hot vinegar water.\n\n**Treatment for Chronic Leg Sores (Lianchuang)**\nGrind *xuexie* (dried lac insect resin) into powder and apply to the sore until dry.\n\n**Alternative Remedy**\nGrind *gudan* (realgar-processed lead) and *wumingyi* (pyrolusite) finely, mix with clear oil, and apply.

Mix with the prepared powder and apply.\n\n**Palm-Rubbing Powder (Hezhang San) for Various Scabies and Leprous Sores**\nGrind one and a half *liang* of *madouling* (birthwort fruit) into powder. Separately grind two and a half *qian* of *baifan* (alum) and three *qian* of *liuhuang* (sulfur).

The error lies in forcing food or broth, which hastens vomiting. The correct approach is to avoid forcing food or broth. First administer *Laifu Dan* (Return Again Elixir) for summerheat; if not a summerheat pattern, then use *Yangzheng Lingsha* (Spirit Sand to Nourish the Upright) and similar remedies. When hungry, dry-fry rice until fragrant and consume without any liquid. After three days, vomiting ceases, and normal eating resumes. **Prescription:** Pound seven *sheng* (1.4 liters) of sugarcane juice and one *sheng* (200 ml) of fresh ginger juice, mix, and divide into three doses. **Alternative Remedy:** Remove the pit from one *zaozi* (jujube), wrap one whole *banmao* (blister beetle) inside, and roast over gentle fire until done.

Take two *qian* per dose, mixed with warm wine. Another remedy: grind *beimu* (fritillaria) into powder, mix with cold wine, and drink as much as possible. Use aged wine, as it will cause clear fluid to flow from the wound. Once the fluid is fully discharged, apply the dregs of the medicine to the wound for healing.\n\nFor scalds and burns:\nGrind charcoal into a paste with water and apply, or grind *tuzhu* (cinnabar) and apply. Alternatively, apply pure tung oil. Another method: pound *baiye* (cypress leaves) into a paste and apply to the painful area, or pound *huangshukui* (yellow hollyhock) flowers and leaves and apply. For all scalds and burns, immediately warm the affected area by the fire. Though painful, endure it for the duration of a meal, and the pain will cease. Do not apply cold water or cold objects, as this will trap heat and cause the flesh to rot—guard against this.\n\nFor cuts and axe wounds with unstoppable bleeding and unbearable pain:\nStir-fry scallion whites in a wok until hot, then pound them into a paste. Apply while hot and bind securely—the pain and bleeding will stop immediately. Replace with fresh scallions when they cool. Alternatively, pound scallion leaves into a paste, stir-fry until hot, and apply. Another method: grind aged lime into a fine powder, mix with an equal amount of *dahuang* (rhubarb), and stir-fry until the mixture turns pink. Apply to the wound. Another remedy: calcine and grind *guodi mo* (soot from the bottom of a wok) and apply. Another method: grind *baiji* (bletilla) and calcined *shigao* (gypsum) together into powder and sprinkle on the wound to close it. Another remedy: apply *wumingyi* (no-name mineral) powder.\n\nFor sprains and strains causing pain in the hands and feet:\nPound fresh ginger into a paste, mix with flour, stir-fry until hot, and consume. Adding scallion whites enhances the effect.\n\nFor foreign objects lodged in the eye:\nGrind high-quality ink with clear water and apply a drop to the corner of the eye—the object will come out.\n\nFor ears discharging pus or fluid:\nBlow powdered raw *baifan* (alum) into the ear three times a day for immediate effect.\n\nFor needles, iron, bamboo, or wood splinters lodged in the flesh:\nGrind ten or more pieces of dried sheep droppings into powder, mix with water, and apply thickly to the affected area. The pain will cease, and the splinter will emerge on its own. Another method: chew the yellow part of a chestnut and apply. Another remedy for bamboo or wood splinters: grind black soybeans into a paste, mix with water, and apply. Another method: grind *bimazi* (castor bean) kernels into a paste. First place a piece of silk over the wound, then apply the medicine, checking frequently. When the splinter emerges, remove the medicine to avoid damaging healthy flesh. Adding *baimei* (dried plum) flesh and grinding together before application is also effective.\n\nFor chapped hands and feet in winter:\nMix *baiji* (bletilla) powder with water and fill the cracks. Avoid contact with water for three to five days.\n\nFor frostbite on the heels in cold weather:\nOn the fifth day of the fifth lunar month at noon, rub the affected area with ginger, scallions, and mugwort for about an hour—it will never recur.\n\nFor toothache:\nDecoct a handful of *qinghao* (sweet wormwood) in a bowl of water until half remains. Rinse the mouth with the warm liquid to stop the pain. Another remedy: grind *liangjiang* (galangal) and *caowu* (wild aconite) into powder and rub it on the teeth. Spit out any saliva—do not swallow. After spitting, rinse the mouth with salt water. Another remedy: for tooth decay or wind-induced toothache, take appropriate medicine based on whether the condition is yin, yang, deficient, or excess. In spring, use *Zhengqi San* (Rectify Qi Powder); in summer, add *dahuang* (rhubarb) and *zhiqiao* (bitter orange peel) to *Baidusan* (Antiphlogistic Powder); in autumn and winter, use *Wujisan* (Five Accumulations Powder) or *Xiaofeng San* (Eliminate Wind Powder). To eliminate parasitic accumulations: grind *binglang* (areca nut) into powder, mix with honey water, and take on an empty stomach. Have the patient eat lightly the day before, skip dinner, and take the medicine at dawn the next day.\n\nFor palm abscesses:\nPound fresh mulberry leaves into a paste and wrap the affected area for healing.\n\n*Xianchuan Waike Mifang*, Volume Ten, Concluded\n*Variant notes: #1 \"Gan\" (干) in the original is written as \"Qian\" (千) in the manuscript. #2 The character \"二\" is absent in the manuscript. #3 After \"染,\" the manuscript includes the character \"淀.\" #4 \"脓\" was originally written as \"浓,\" corrected per the manuscript. #5 \"筋\" is suspected to be a miswriting of \"箸.\" #6 \"汁\" in the manuscript is written as \"汗.\" #7 The missing character in the original is \"皆\" in the manuscript. #8 \"羊\" is suspected to be a miswriting of \"王.\"*\n\n*Xianchuan Waike Mifang*, Volume Eleven\nCompiled by Zhaoyi Yuanyangzi of Junyi\n\n**Treatise on Miscellaneous Disorders**\n\n**For Children’s Ailments**\n\nFor vexing heat in the five centers with thirst and desire to drink, boil black soybeans and feed them to the child to bring peace.\n\nFor chronic convulsions with lethargy and occasional spasms, grind *lindera root* (乌药) into water and administer warm.\n\nFor acute or chronic convulsions in children, grind together twenty grains of *Zhenling Dan* (震灵丹), ten grains of *Laifu Dan* (来复丹), and ten grains of *Bai Yuanzi* (白圆子). Form into pills the size of mung beans using glutinous rice paste. Administer five pills for older children and three for younger ones. For chronic convulsions, use a decoction of northern jujubes and tangerine peel to swallow the pills; for acute convulsions, use fresh ginger juice with boiling water.\n\n**Ten Types of Cinnabar Toxins in Children**\nMaster Xu states: These ten types of cinnabar toxins, if left untreated for three days, will invade the intestines and stomach, becoming incurable. Carefully distinguish each type and treat accordingly with these formulas—failure is rare.\n\n1. **Flying Hearth Cinnabar (飞灶丹)**: Swelling with a glossy appearance starting from the crown of the head. Pound scallion whites to extract their natural juice and apply.\n2. **Auspicious Hearth Cinnabar (吉灶丹)**: Red, swollen, and painful starting from the head. Apply a mixture of red adzuki bean powder and egg white.\n3. **Ghost Fire Cinnabar (鬼火丹)**: Red swelling starting from the face. Mix *heart of the hearth* soil (宠心土) with egg white and apply.\n4. **Heavenly Fire Cinnabar (天火丹)**: Red spots starting from the back.

Grind equal parts of these four ingredients into a fine powder. Mix with well water to an appropriate consistency, spread in a bowl, and place it atop two bricks with a gap beneath. Burn mugwort (*Ai*) to fumigate with its smoke until the mixture turns black and dry. Remove the medicine, grind it again into powder, and mix with clear oil for application. If worms are present, use boiled oil for application.\n\nAnother formula: Grind equal parts *Wu Bei Zi* and *Baizhi* into powder. For weeping sores, sprinkle the powder to absorb the pus. For dry sores, mix with clear oil and apply.\n\n**For Pox-Related Eye Afflictions in Children**\nGrind *Gujingcao* (谷精草) into powder and administer with white persimmon, pig liver, or malt sugar.\n\n**Shengxi Fuming San (生犀复明散)**, for various eye disorders:\n*Red peony root* (赤芍药) 2 liang, *Scutellaria* (黄芩) 1 liang, *Akebia stem* (木通) 2 liang, *Mulberry root bark* (桑白皮) 2 liang, *Gentian* (龙胆草) 2 liang, *Saposhnikovia* (防风) 2 liang, *Notopterygium* (羌活) 2 liang, *Tangkuei tails* (当归尾) 2 liang, *Rhubarb* (大黄) 8 qian, *Bitter orange peel* (枳壳, with the inner membrane removed) 6 qian.\nCrush the ingredients, and for each dose, take 5 qian with 1.5 cups of water. Add a small amount of fresh mulberry root bark and decoct to 80% of the original volume. Administer after meals. For red eyes with thick obstructions, add raw clam powder; for painful swelling, add raw rehmannia for efficacy.\n\n**Eye Drops**\nWash *Huanglian* (宣黄连) thoroughly, chop, and decoct in a ceramic vessel until reduced by half. Strain the liquid, place it in a ceramic bowl over a steamer, and evaporate until the liquid is minimal. Add a small amount of borneol, store in a clean container or horn tube, and apply to the eyes. It is also effective for festering canthi. When preparing the medicine, strain through fine silk to ensure no dust or debris remains.\n\n**For Sudden Redness and Festering Canthi**\n*Huanglian* (黄连) 5 qian, *Tangkuei tails* (当归尾) 3 qian, *Mirabilite* (朴消) 3 qian, *Apricot kernel* (板杏) 2 qian, *Huangbai* (黄柏) 2 qian, *Teasel root* (川续断) 1 qian.\nCrush the ingredients, place in a bowl over a steamer, and steam thoroughly. While hot, dip and apply the juice to the eyes.\n\nAnother method for red eyes and dim, painful vision: Keep the eyes tightly closed, scoop hot water with the hands, and pour it over the eyes. Stop when the water cools. Repeat frequently—relief lies in keeping the eyes closed.\n\n**For Obstructions and Films in the Eyes**\nDissolve 10 liang of pure *Mirabilite* (朴消) in hot water, strain through a bamboo basket lined with fine paper, and collect in a ceramic bowl. Heat over charcoal until dry, then place on the ground overnight. Add 2 liang of processed *Yellow Lead* (黄丹) and half a qian of musk, grind finely, sift through silk, and add borneol. Apply to the eyes.\n\n**Fumigation for Sudden Red Eyes**\nDecoct *Bohe* (薄荷), *Jingjie* (荆芥), and *Fangfeng* (防风) in a ceramic pot. Fumigate the eyes with the hot vapor, then wash with the hands.\n\n**Huangu Dan (换骨丹)**, for wind-dampness, lumbar, and leg disorders:\nGrind 6 liang of *Cao Wu* (草乌, slightly removing the skin and tips) into powder. Mix with 2 liang of fresh tofu to form cakes, boil in water until they float, then remove. The boiling must be precise—overcooking weakens the medicine, while undercooking makes it too potent. Soak 3 liang of *Cang Zhu* (苍术) in rice-washed water, dry over a fire, and add 1 liang of pure *Tianma* (天麻) and half a liang of washed and lightly fried *Quan Xie* (全蝎). Grind these with the *Cao Wu* cakes into powder, form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds using rice paste. In the evening, avoid eating; before bed, chew *Mugua* (木瓜) and take twenty pills with warm wine. When the medicine permeates the body and feet by midnight, a numbing sensation indicates its efficacy.\n\n**Shujin San (舒筋散)**, for blood stasis, muscle spasms, joint pain, and difficulty walking—this is the foremost formula for invigorating blood and transforming qi:\n*Corydalis* (玄胡索), *Tangkuei* (当归), *Cinnamon bark* (官桂).\nGrind equal parts into powder. Take 2 qian per dose with warm wine on an empty stomach.\n\n**Huoluo Dan (活络丹)**, for all ailments of the waist and legs:\nFour liang of *Huluba* (胡芦巴); two liang stir-fried with four liang of *Haijinsha* (海金沙) until the latter is spent, and two liang stir-fried with four liang of *Badou* (巴豆) until red. *Haijinsha* is commonly called \"bamboo garden dung\"; gather it in the eighth or ninth month, wrap it in paper-lined baskets, dry in the sun, then tap with bamboo to dislodge the seeds, discarding the leaves. (Beware of counterfeits sold by merchants—use only whole *Badou*, shelled.) Four liang of *Cang’ercao* (苍耳草), dried over fire (commonly called \"wild eggplant leaf\"; in the *Bencao*, it is *Xi’er*). Four liang of *Zuochanteng* (左缠藤), leaves and all, dried over fire.\nGrind the three ingredients into powder, form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds using a paste of fine wine and wheat flour. Swallow thirty to forty pills with unheated wine. For waist ailments, take while half-hungry; for knee and leg ailments, take on an empty stomach.\n\n**Plaster Formula for All Sores:**\nBoil one jin of clear oil with two liang of human hair until melted. Add, as desired, half a liang each of *Gancao* nodes (甘草节), *Danggui* tails (当归尾), *Huanglian* (黄连), *Badou* (巴豆), *Bimazi* (蓖麻子), *Huangualou* (黄瓜篓), and *Mubiezi* (木鳖子). Boil twice, strain, then add five liang of *shuifen* (水粉). Boil again until bubbling, then add seven liang of *Huangdan* (黄丹). Boil once more until bubbling, then add one liang of *Ruxiang* powder (乳香末). Stir constantly with peach and willow twigs until droplets form pearls in water and do not stick to the hand—then the plaster is ready.\n\n**Alternative Plaster Formula:**\nBoil five liang of sesame oil with twenty-eight *Badou* (巴豆) and twenty-eight cun of willow twigs until the *Badou* turns black. Strain, then gradually add two liang of *Gudan* (谷丹), stirring constantly with willow twigs. When droplets form unbroken beads in water and do not stick to the hand, remove from heat. Blend in one qian of *Ruxiang* powder, store in a ceramic vessel, and apply once cooled.\n\n**Shen Shou Xiang Su San (神授香苏散)**, for seasonal epidemics:\nAs the formula’s preface states: Once, during a great plague in the city, a white-haired elder taught a wealthy household to prepare and distribute this remedy, curing all the afflicted. Later, plague ghosts questioned the household, and when told the truth, they exclaimed, \"This elder has saved three cities!\"—then bowed and departed. Those who take this medicine must abstain from meat, fish, wine, and rich foods; none will fail to recover.\n\nDuring the former Yuan dynasty, a severe epidemic struck Taihe County in Jian, Jiangxi. A physician returning from house calls late at night suddenly encountered a divine figure on horseback with an entourage. Sensing the figure was no mortal, the physician prostrated himself. The deity halted and demanded, \"Who are you?\" The physician replied, \"I am a physician.\" The deity asked, \"What medicines do you use to treat illness?\" The physician answered, \"I adjust formulas based on the patient’s cold, heat, and severity.\" The deity said, \"That is not so. For all cases, *Xiang Su San* is best.\" The physician returned home and, the next day, followed the deity’s instructions—all were cured. His medical practice flourished, bringing him lifelong fortune and reverence for the deity. This account is recorded here.\n\n*Xiangfuzi* (香附子), stir-fried to remove fuzz—four liang\n*Purple perilla leaves* (紫苏叶)—four liang\n*Chenpi* (陈皮)—one liang\n*Gancao* (甘草), roasted—one liang\nChop coarsely, grind into powder. For each dose, steep three qian in one cup of water, decoct to seven parts, strain, and take warm at any time, three times daily.\n\n**Xian Fang San Bu Wan (仙方三补丸)**, a supreme supplement for all deficiencies and debilities, effective for young and old alike:\nTwo liang of *Poguzhi* (破故纸), stir-fried between paper until fragrant and cooked\nOne liang of *Baifuling* (白茯苓), peeled\nOne liang of *Moyao* (没药), steeped in ash-free wine\nWhen the wine has dissolved the *Moyao* to a syrup-like consistency, grind the first two ingredients into powder, form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds using the medicated wine paste. Take twenty to thirty pills on an empty stomach with warm water.\n\nThe *Xian Fang* states: Once, a man who took this medicine retained a youthful appearance into old age. *Poguzhi* supplements the kidneys, *Fuling* nourishes the heart, and *Moyao* nourishes the blood. When these three are robust, the body naturally thrives.\n\n**For Jaundice from Wine (酒疸脾黄):**\nGrind *Mubiezi* (木鳖子) with vinegar and take one or two cups—relief will follow.\n\n**For Unstoppable Night Sweats:**\nFill the navel with *Wubeizi* (五倍子) powder mixed with saliva, bind with a cloth, and leave overnight—sweating will cease.\n\n**For Genital Sweating:**\nWash *Huangqi* (绵黄芪), slice thinly, place in a pot, and stir-fry with wine until dry and brittle. Grind into powder and take with boiled pig’s heart—marvelously effective.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nGrind equal parts *Shechuangzi* (蛇床子) and *Shichangpu* (石菖蒲) into powder and apply two or three times daily.\n\n**For Acne (痤疿):**\nCut a fresh cucumber and rub the affected area, or bathe with a decoction of jujube leaves.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nMix four liang of *Yuyingfen* (玉英粉) and *Zhenbangfen* (真蚌粉) with one liang of *Huashi* (滑石) and two liang of *Lüdoufen* (绿豆粉), then apply the powder dry.\n\n**For □□ (gagging):**\nUse *Bimazi* (蓖麻子) as needed—remove the coarse shells, stir-fry until cooked. Eat the sweet ones; spit out the bitter ones. Eating more brings quicker results.\n\n**For Sudden Tongue Swelling Protruding from the Mouth (due to centipede venom):**\nCut the comb of a rooster, collect the blood in a ceramic dish, and immerse the tongue in it—swallowing will cause the tongue to retract.\n\n**For Delirium, Seeing Ghosts, or Madness:**\nAdd *Chensha* powder (辰砂末) to *Pingwei San* (平胃散) and take with jujube decoction.\n\n**For Chronic \"Pig Cold Wind\" Syndrome (猪寒风证), *Rusheng San* (如圣散) is effective for men and women of any age:**\nEqual parts of:\n*Weilingxian* (威灵仙)\n*Fangfeng* (防风)\n*Jingjie* (荆芥)\n*Fangji* (防己)\n*Mahuang* (麻黄)\n*Xingren* (杏仁)\n*Xixin* (细辛)\n*Chuanxiong* (川芎)\n*Baizhi* (白芷)\nChop, then decoct with three slices of ginger in fine wine and take warm at the onset of symptoms. Later, roast a large *Huangjingchai* (黄荆柴) over fire, collect the liquid from both ends, mix with aged wine, and swallow *Jinbo Zhenxin Wan* (金箔镇心丸). Avoid foods that provoke wind or toxins.\n\n**On Great Wind (大风):**\n*Xiaoranzi’s* Treatise on Great Wind\nGreat Wind manifests in myriad ways, often arising from excessive desires and the depletion of blood and qi...\n\nOr from pent-up rage, sorrow, fright, or repressed emotions that cannot be released; or from bodily weakness and porous skin; or from drinking wine while exposed to wind; or from stripping off clothes while sweating, then entering water; or from bathing and immediately facing wind; or from drunkenly sleeping in the open; or from wounds on hands or feet that admit wind-toxins; or from sudden storms, cold water, or damp obstructions that invade the flesh—if one is afflicted in the moment, it may lead to the suffering of Great Wind. The disease’s causes spread through the channels and network vessels, transmit to the viscera and bowels, emerge in the four limbs, and steam both internally and externally, forming blistering ringworm.\n\nThe origins of this illness comprise three syndromes and five mortal stages. The first syndrome is Water Wind; the second, Transmission and Transformation; the third, self-neglect through lack of regulation. The five mortal stages are: first, Skin Death—numbness and loss of sensation; second, Flesh Death—insensitivity to cutting; third, Blood Death—festering and suppuration; fourth, Sinew Death—shedding of hands and feet; fifth, Bone Death—collapse of the nasal bridge, loss of eyes, eversion of lips, leading to loss of voice, beyond all remedy.\n\nThe Five Winds are: first, Wind afflicting the Lung Channel, where the eyebrows fall first; second, Wind afflicting the Liver Channel, where the face erupts in purple blisters; third, Wind afflicting the Kidney Channel, where the soles of the feet perforate first; fourth, Wind afflicting the Spleen Channel, where the entire body becomes scaly like ringworm; fifth, Wind afflicting the Heart Channel, where the eyes are first damaged.\n\nSome cases arise from ancestral gravesites or residences, transmitted in succession among parents, spouses, or household members. Others stem from carelessness outside—latrines, bedchambers, bedding, clothing, or resting beneath bridges or trees—where fate aligns with baleful stars, and one contracts this vile malady, mired in its filth. The manifestations vary, the suffering unbearable, and those who seek treatment often find no relief. Some die within a year or half a year.\n\nIn all cases of this affliction, early intervention is essential for ease of cure. One must carefully examine and distinguish the conditions, for if treatment errs even slightly, the consequences may be as vast as the difference between a hair’s breadth and a thousand miles. Alas, even skilled physicians and learned scholars often recoil from its repulsiveness and pay it little heed.\n\nSome unlearned individuals recklessly pass down their techniques, wielding blades and needles to draw blood at will, burning arsenic or moxa to fumigate and induce salivation, or applying toxic herbs steeped in oil to the body. Those who submit to such treatments find no efficacy in a hundred cases. Even if there is slight temporary relief, the affliction recurs over time, and without encountering a superior formula or wondrous medicine, the patient may ultimately die of the disease.\n\nWhen seeking medical treatment, one must first reside in a quiet chamber, abstain from alcohol and sexual activity, purify the mind and cleanse the heart, and sincerely repent before the divine physician. Additionally, one must avoid exposure to wind and the stirring of qi, as well as refrain from consuming meat, fish, salt, fermented sauces, raw or cold foods. Patience and composure are essential. Only then may one take various medicines, adjusting dosages as needed, preparing pills and powders, and administering them according to the prescribed method—thereby ensuring a cure without fail.\n\nFirst, administer purgative pills to expel foul blood. If pus or festering sores are present, use medicinal washes for fumigation and cleansing. Within ten days, healthy flesh will emerge. Old sores will gradually recede and cease to erupt, the ears and nose will regain their openness, the skin will feel refreshed, eyebrows and beard will regrow, the complexion will become radiant, and the five viscera will be harmonized. The efficacy of these treatments defies full description.\n\nThe formulas are as follows:\n\n**Disperse Wind Powder (Day 1)**\n*Fragrant Angelica (1 tael), Scorpion (1 tael, tips removed), Ginseng (1 tael)*\nGrind into powder. Take two mace each dose at noon, consuming only congee. Avoid ginger, pepper, and all heating substances. Refrain from eating supper. The next morning, take the powder on an empty stomach, mixed with warm wine, and delay breakfast. Mild dryness of the skin is desirable.\n\n**Expel Wind Powder (Purgative for Blood, Day 2)**\n*Rhubarb (6 taels), Sichuan Curcuma (1.8 taels, smaller roots preferred), Gleditsia Thorn (1 tael)*\nGrind into powder. Begin with a dose of six, seven, or five mace, adding two and a half mace of *Da Feng* oil, a small amount of refined mirabilite, and mix with a bowl of well-brewed wine (not hot, but lukewarm). Do not eat congee in the evening. Wait until the *Xu* hour (7–9 p.m.), place a bowl of warm water in a basin on the table, and add a small amount of sugar or honey decoction to a plate—ensuring the patient does not see the medicine beforehand. After taking the medicine, have the patient rinse their mouth with water, then sweeten it with the honey decoction. They must not lie down; instead, have someone accompany them while sitting for a long while. Severe abdominal pain is most desirable, and purging ten or more times is unproblematic. Afterward, consume thin congee to restore strength.\n\nThis purgative is generally unsuitable for the elderly or weak; those under fifty may be treated. For the robust, administer three doses within ten days: on the first day, *Disperse Wind Powder*; the second day, *Expel Wind Powder*; the third day, *Grind Wind Pill*; the fourth day, *Disperse Wind Powder* again; the fifth day, *Expel Wind Powder*; and the sixth day, *Grind Wind Pill*. For the frail, administer one dose within ten days. Once some improvement is seen, follow the regimen for the robust, taking one dose every ten days after two months. Carefully note the days.\n\n**Grind Wind Pill (Day 3, two doses daily)**\n*Sichuan Angelica, Notopterygium, Pubescent Angelica, Sichuan Lovage (smaller roots), Gastrodia, Asarum, Saposhnikovia, Schizonepeta, Clematis, Ephedra (nodes removed), Fleeceflower Root, Tribulus, Arctium, Toad Leaf, Cocklebur, Ground Pine*\nSixteen ingredients, each one tael.

Take thirty pills per dose, before or after meals, twice daily.\n\n**Wash Formula**\n*Lycium Bark, Schizonepeta, Sophora, Asarum (3 taels each)*\nChop and mix evenly. Use two taels per wash, decocted in river water. Fumigate and wash the entire body; bleeding indicates efficacy.

Eyebrows will naturally regrow.\n\n**Moxibustion Method for Radical Cure**\nAt the crease between the tendon and bone of the big toe, and at the joints of the fingers—approximately half an inch in length—moxa each point three times to expel toxic qi.\n\n*End of Scroll Eleven, Esoteric Formulas of the Immortal’s External Medicine*\n\n**Appendix: The Power of Convenience in Action**\nIn this world, convenience is paramount; when strength permits, act without delay, for missed opportunities are to be regretted. Those with wealth and power wield immense influence over others’ fortunes. In all matters, let convenience guide your heart: grant one measure of leniency, and others receive one measure of blessing. Go further—perform good deeds of every kind without pause. Emulate the sages who sought to benefit all under heaven; no greater merit exists.\n\n**First among great conveniences is the equitable sale of grain.**\nThe Celestial Master Zhang of Han taught that the foremost merit lies in saving lives. Those with means should, at harvest time, purchase grain in abundance—or store their own surplus—and release it at the original price during shortages. This costs them nothing yet brings immense benefit to others. The late Huang Chengshi of Chengdu practiced this and was honored by the Purple Palace Perfected Lord Zhang; he ascended to immortality, and his family enjoyed prosperity for generations. Even better is to sell grain at a reduced price during times of scarcity.\n\n**Second is the relief of illness—a great convenience.**\nThose who devoutly prepare and distribute the *Ruyi Elixir* of Perfected Lord Xu can cure myriad diseases, especially epidemics. Other efficacious remedies are also commendable, as is the printing and distribution of proven formulas.\n\n**Third, in summer, provide cool water; in winter, offer clothing to the elderly and infirm.**\nCare for widows, orphans, the childless, and the solitary. Foster abandoned children. Provide coffins for the unburied. Aid those in sudden distress or dire need as circumstances allow.\n\n**Fourth, deliverance of the departed is a small effort with vast merit.**\nMaster Ge ascended through this practice, and Perfected Lady Sa likewise attained immortality. All past immortals and masters prioritized this; those who regularly perform sacrificial refinement bring blessings to the departed. Even offering a single meal confers no small benefit.\n\n**Enlightened individuals and upright scholars** delve deeply, seeking to comprehend the illusory nature of life and destiny and to master the alchemy of water and fire. They not only transcend the mundane but also deliver the departed. Merit and virtue begin here, but one must seek a teacher’s guidance to avoid squandering the opportunity.\n\n**Fifth, all living beings share the capacity for suffering.**\nWhere possible, refrain from killing. Treat insects, birds, and beasts with the same compassion. Daoist scriptures prescribe fasting and releasing life on the Three Officials’ festivals, for on the Three Primes, fasting is judged by one’s abstention from taking life.\n\n**Sixth, build bridges, repair roads, dig wells, clear channels, promote benefit, eliminate harm, encourage virtue, resolve doubts, mediate disputes, and end conflicts—all are acts of convenience.**\nFor the wealthy and powerful, such deeds reach many, ensuring abundant rewards, augmented fortune and longevity, and blessings for descendants. For Daoist practitioners, they fulfill both merit and practice, naturally attracting a teacher and achieving enlightenment. Even those of modest means who act thus perform a difficult task.\n\nAs the Reclusive Perfected One once said: \"Of old, those who performed meritorious deeds could save a ruined world. The wealthy find it easy to do good, while the poor struggle to follow suit. Yet those who act from a place of difficulty earn merit a hundredfold greater than the wealthy.\"\n\n**Mirror for Preserving Life in Newly Recovered Cases of Febrile Disease and Heat-Induced Convulsions**\n*Recorded by the Preserver of Vitality, Daoist of Ningchuan*\n\n**Taboos for Epidemics**\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* asks: \"After recovering from febrile disease, why do some suffer relapses?\"\nQibo replies: \"Eating meat causes recurrence; overeating leads to lingering illness. Lingering illness arises when, despite intense heat, one forces food, allowing heat to lodge within. When grain qi interacts with it, the two heats combine, causing relapse—termed *food relapse*.\"\nWang Qixuan explains: \"When residual heat remains, it spreads throughout the body. *Recurrence* means the illness returns.\"\nAfter recovering from heat disease, if blood and qi have not stabilized and residual heat persists, premature exertion causes *overstrain relapse*.\n\nZhang Zhongjing’s *Treatise on Cold Damage* and Cheng Wuji’s commentary state: \"If a man has recently recovered but not fully, and a woman lies with him, it is called *yang exchange*. If a woman has recently recovered but not fully, and a man lies with her, it is called *yin exchange*. The interaction of yin and yang stirs residual toxins, which infect like an exchange.\"\n*Sexual relapse* refers to self-induced arousal; it is also called *female overstrain relapse*. Internal depletion of true qi and external stirring of pathogenic heat leave true qi deficient and evil qi flourishing—rendering it incurable. The late Gu Zixian, though recovered, did not heed Hua Tuo’s warnings. On his deathbed, his tongue protruded several inches—a cautionary tale.\n\n**External Causes of Overstrain Relapse**\n- Combing hair too early invites head wind.\n- Washing the face too early causes head heat.\n- Washing the feet too early leads to foot numbness.\n- Bathing too early induces fever and dizziness.\n- Anger breeds stagnation.\n- Long journeys weaken the legs, causing flaccid wind.\n- Overexertion leads to hemiplegia.\n- Anxiety depletes qi.\n- Rising too early or straining the mind and body risks relapse.\n\n**Internal Causes of Food Relapse**\n- Eating mutton causes wheezing, suffocation, and death.\n- Eating sheep’s heart or lungs risks fatal relapse.\n- Eating sheep’s blood or liver causes severe diarrhea.\n- Eating beef leads to intractable dysentery.\n- Eating sheep or pig intestines causes chronic illness.\n- Eating horse meat is lethal.\n- Eating poultry too soon is lethal.\n\n**Internal Causes of Food Relapse (Continued)**\n- Eating beef liver causes unceasing bloody diarrhea.\n- Eating dog meat induces jaundice and certain death.\n- Eating roasted meat leads to wasting-thirst.\n- Consuming bone broth causes fever and bone steaming.\n- Eating rabbit meat harms the heart.\n- Eating yellow cattle meat forms intractable abdominal masses.\n- Eating chicken meat breeds parasitic illnesses.\n- Eating carp risks relapse.\n- Eating eel induces vomiting and dysentery.\n- Eating fish preserved in brine causes jaundice.\n- Eating goose meat triggers cholera.\n- Eating blood clams is lethal.\n- Eating damp noodles induces tidal fever.\n- Eating cucumbers or snake gourds risks fatal relapse.\n- Eating eggplant causes malaria.\n- Eating white hyacinth beans obstructs the chest with cold qi.\n- Eating mallow harms the eyes.\n- Eating raw vegetables aggravates heart illness, leading to death and irreversible pallor.\n\n**Other Causes of Relapse**\n- Drinking wine too soon induces manic delirium.\n- Drinking clear liquor causes edema.\n- After recovering from an epidemic with a recent sweat, drinking cold water damages the pericardium, leaving one debilitated and unrecovered.\n\n**Sun Zhenren’s Prescriptions and Discourse:**\nAfter recovering from a febrile illness or major ailment, consuming pork, sheep’s blood, fatty fish, or greasy foods will invariably cause severe diarrhea—an affliction beyond medical remedy, leading to certain death. If one eats pastries, glutinous millet, raw fish, roasted meats, malt sugar, preserved crabs, dried meats, jujubes, chestnuts, or other fruits such as peaches, apricots, plums, and cherries—along with any hard, indigestible foods—the weakened stomach qi will fail to digest them. Purgative medicines must then be administered, but excessive diarrhea will be uncontrollable; without purgation, death is inevitable. Even if purged, recovery remains precarious, and all cases are difficult to save.\n\nWithin a hundred days of convalescence, when qi and strength have not yet fully returned, engaging in sexual activity is fatal. Even the robust must abstain for sixty days. After recovery, one should only consume thin rice porridge or gruel, eating sparingly to maintain slight hunger. Avoid satiety, and refrain from all other foods—even if cravings arise, do not indulge them.\n\nFor post-illness thirst, *Tianshui Powder* is recommended. Watermelon and Asian pears may quench thirst and dispel residual heat.\n\nHaving practiced medicine for over forty years and treated countless patients, I invariably provide these prohibitions and dietary restrictions to those recovering from febrile illnesses, thereby preventing relapse.\n\nNow I observe that among the vulgar and ignorant, some rely on their innate robust constitution, while others suffer only mild afflictions. Though they may fortuitously recover without relapse, they take this as the norm and are misled by the masses. Little do they know that one’s endowment of qi waxes and wanes, and the severity of illness varies—yet they recklessly generalize, and thus countless perish needlessly. There are also mothers who dote on their children, or wives who cherish their husbands, and when they beg for food, these women secretly indulge them. They disregard the gravity of life and death, valuing only the fleeting pleasure of the palate—only to bring harm upon those they love.\n\nAlas, such truths may be shared with the discerning, but are difficult to convey to the common folk. Thus, the wise must exercise utmost caution. Having distilled the wisdom of sages and worthies from their collected works, I have compiled these prohibitions and dietary laws, entitling them *The Mirror for Preserving Life*.\n\nFor infants with smallpox or measles, the following ten perils must also be avoided during the \"silkworm month\":\n- The foul odor of armpit fox-musk\n- The noxious vapors of ditches and filthy drains\n- The turbid, lustful qi of the bedchamber (especially after recent intercourse)\n- The menstrual qi of women, along with all manner of bloody, rank odors\n- The fumes of alcohol and the stench of meat or fish (inhaling the breath of a drunkard may drive pox toxins inward; if the child drinks wine, the toxins will erupt outward)\n- The fumes of sulfur-based mosquito repellents and other toxic substances (if one with red eyes is exposed, the pain will be severe and recovery difficult)\n- The restless, impure qi of musk (inhaling musk may draw pox toxins inward)\n- The steam and dampness of epidemic sweat (keep coriander nearby on all sides to counteract its effects)\n- The acrid smoke of burning hair, fish bones, or other foul odors, as well as wood smoke entering the mouth and nose\n- The pungent vapors of onions, garlic, leeks, and chives, along with the greasy fumes of frying oil\n\nThe above prohibitions are drawn from *The Complete Collection for Infant Care*; none may be violated, lest complications arise—this I have witnessed firsthand.\n\nSome may argue that rural children, left to their natural state, suffer no ill effects from such transgressions. Yet this overlooks the distinction between noble and base, and the differences in innate endowment.\n\n**Coriander Wine** is used to promote the eruption of smallpox in children. Take three liang of finely chopped coriander, steep it in two large cups of wine, and bring to a boil. Immediately cover to trap the vapors, then allow to cool. Strain and lightly spray the child’s nape, back, chest, abdomen, and feet—avoiding the head and face. Place the leftover coriander in a pouch and hang it in the bed canopy. The remaining wine may be consumed by the wet nurse.\n\n*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: There are six conditions under which illness cannot be cured. The first is arrogance and self-indulgence, refusing to heed reason.\n\nThe six conditions under which illness cannot be cured are as follows: The second is valuing wealth over life; the third is failing to regulate clothing and diet; the fourth is when both yin and yang are depleted and the visceral qi is insufficient; the fifth is when the body is too weak to take medicine; the sixth is trusting shamans over physicians.\n\n**Liu Hejian’s Poem on Nursing Infants**\nTo raise the young requires care and vigilance,\nNever indulge or neglect their needs.\nToo much milk will harm the stomach,\nExcess food will clog the spleen.\nThick quilts bring no benefit,\nLight clothing is just right.\nLet them see the sun often, free from drafts,\nAnd follow the seasons in warmth and chill.\n\n**Prescriptions for Eye Ailments**\n*General Formula for Dispersing, Deficiency, and Excess*\nFor detoxification, add:\n- Mulberry bark (*Sangshu*): 2 liang\n- Cimicifuga (*Shengma*): 2 liang\n- Red peony (*Chishaoyao*): 3 liang\n- Sichuan lovage (*Chuanxiong*): 2 liang\n- Bupleurum (*Chaihu*): 3 liang (remove the nodes)\n- Kudzu (*Gange*): 3 liang\n- Scrophularia (*Xuanshen*): 1 liang (remove the galls)\n- Ligusticum (*Fuxiong*): 1 liang\n- Scutellaria (*Huangqin*): ½ liang\n- Schizonepeta (*Jingjie*): ½ liang\n- Licorice (*Gancao*): 1 liang\n- White atractylodes (*Baizhu*): ½ liang\n- Gardenia (*Shanzhizi*): ½ liang\n- Red poria (*Chifuling*): 1 liang\n- Cassia seed (*Jumingshi*): use sparingly\nBoil in plain water and take.\n\n*Qianghuo Powder for Heat*\n- Ledebouriella (*Fangfeng*): 2 liang\n- Notopterygium (*Qianghuo*): 1 liang\n- Red peony (*Chishaoyao*): 3 liang\n- Angelica (*Baizhi*): 1 liang\n- Sichuan lovage (*Chuanxiong*): 2 liang\n- Bupleurum (*Chaihu*): 1 liang\n- Alisma (*Zexie*): ½ liang\n- Stephania (*Fangji*): ½ liang\n- Licorice (*Gancao*): 1 liang\n- Schizonepeta (*Jingjie*): 1 liang\n- White poria (*Baifuling*): 2 liang\n- Chrysanthemum (*Juhua*): 1 liang\n- Asarum (*Xixin*): ½ liang (remove the leaves)\n- White atractylodes (*Baizhu*): 1 liang\n\n*Purgative Formula*\n- Red peony (*Chishaoyao*)\n- Scutellaria (*Huangqin*)\n- Bitter orange (*Zhike*)\n- Schizonepeta (*Jingjie*)\nBoil equal parts until done, then steep with rhubarb (*Dahuang*) and mirabilite (*Poxia*).

If the condition fails to resolve over time, add raw Sichuan aconite (*Sheng Chuanwu*).\n\n*To grind away long-standing obstructions in the aged and weak:*\n- Cicada slough (*Chantui*): 2 *qian*\n- Sichuan lovage (*Chuanxiong*): 2 *qian*\n- Antelope horn (*Lingyangjiao*): ½ *liang*\n- White hibiscus (*Bai Hanhua*), thorns removed and stir-fried: 2 *qian*\n- Licorice (*Gancao*), stir-fried: ½ *qian*\n- Chinese angelica (*Danggui*): 2 *qian*\n- Prepared rehmannia (*Shu Dihuang*): ½ *qian*\n- Scouring rush (*Muzei*), nodes removed: 1 *qian*\n- Selfheal (*Xiakucao*): ½ *qian*\n- Abalone shell (*Shijueming*), calcined: 2 *qian*\n- Gypsum (*Shigao*), calcined: 1 *qian*\n- Scrophularia (*Xuanshen*): ½ *qian*\n- *Qingxiangzi*: 1 *qian*\n\nGrind the above into powder, refine with honey into pills the size of a bullet.

Take thirty pills per dose.\n\nGenerally, the liver governs the eyes; the liver receives blood and thus enables vision. If blood is weak, the liver’s *qi* lacks nourishment, and if the liver’s *qi* is not flourishing, the gallbladder’s fluid cannot ascend. This leads to blurred vision, weak eyesight, and unclear perception in children. This formula greatly supplements liver blood, enriches gallbladder fluid, and resolves hidden obstructions in the eyes.\n\nTake on an empty stomach with salted water to guide the formula downward. At midday, take with tea to clear the head and eyes. Before sleep, take with wine to nourish liver blood. For those who do not drink, take with a decoction of ginseng and Chinese angelica. Prolonged use yields excellent results.\n\n**For All Kinds of Red Eyes and Head-Wind with Redness, Swelling, and Inability to Open the Eyes**\nFor pain from blows to the temples, this application is most effective.\n- Pig tusk *zaojiao* (Gleditsia sinensis)\n- Phellodendron (*Huangbo*)\n- Turmeric (*Jianghuang*)\n- Arisaema (*Nanxing*)\n- Wild aconite (*Cao Wu*)\n- Coptis (*Huangliang*)\n\nGrind into powder, mix with natural ginger juice, and apply to the temples.

Applying mashed onion is also effective.\n\n**Washing Formula for Various Eye Conditions**\n- Coptis (*Huangliang*)\n- Chinese angelica (*Danggui*)\n- Red peony (*Chishaoyao*)\n- Talcum (*Huashi*)\n\nGrind into powder, steep in hot water, and let settle.

For traumatic blood attacking the pupil, disperses blood and expels wind. Pregnant women should not take this.\n- *Baimu* (white atractylodes)\n- Poria (*Fuling*)\n- Licorice (*Gancao*)\n- Fennel (*Huixiang*)\n- Cinnamon (*Rougui*)\n- Corydalis (*Yuanhusuo*)\n- Fresh rehmannia (*Shengdihuang*)\n- Ligusticum (*Chuanxiong*)\n- Peony (*Shaoyao*)\n- Cattail pollen (*Puhuang*)\n- Costus (*Muxiang*)\n- Angelica (*Baizhi*)\n- Chinese angelica (*Danggui*)\n\nGrind into powder and take with wine.\n\n**For Pterygium**\nIn the twelfth lunar month, use a male pig’s gallbladder, fill with *mayaxiao* (sodium sulfate), and dry in the wind.

Daily, use a duck feather to brush the mirabilite from the outside of the gallbladder until exhausted. Store in an earthenware jar. Use as usual for application.\n\n**For Smallpox in Children**\nDo not purge residual toxin. Only use mung bean skin and *gujingcao* (pipewort) in formulas. Avoid all other foods; regularly eating snails is beneficial.\n\n**For Smallpox Affecting the Eyes**\nTake white persimmon.\n\n**For Children’s Measles or Smallpox Affecting the Eyes and Causing Corneal Opacities**\n- Cassia seed (*Caojueming*)\n- Trichosanthes root (*Tianhuafen*)\n- Licorice (*Gancao*)\n- Red peony (*Chishaoyao*): each #4 *qian*\n\nGrind into powder.

Remove and grind finely; use a dose the size of a millet grain to apply to the eye.\n\n**Frequent Eye-Washing Formula**\nFor all types of wind-heat, heart-heat, wind-toxin erosion, redness, roughness, itching, pain, obstructions, nebulae, and blood-wind conditions in women.\n- *Wubeizi* (gallnut), sifted to remove impurities\n- *Manjingzi* (vitex fruit), remove white skin, wash with hot water\n\nGrind into powder. For each dose of 2 *qian*, place in a sand pot with half a cup of water and 30–50 copper coins.

Adding crushed scallions enhances the effect.\n\n*End of Scroll Eleven of the Immortal’s Transmitted External Medicine Secret Formulas*\n\n**Appendix: On Exerting Effort to Practice Convenience**\n\nIn this world, convenience is foremost; where strength suffices, act without delay—regret follows hesitation.\n\nFor those of wealth, nobility, and power, the sway of fortune and misfortune over others is effortless. When facing matters, let convenience guide the heart: granting one measure of leniency bestows one measure of blessing upon others. Further, exert oneself in good deeds, practicing every form of convenience without pause. People will revere such virtue as that of sages who benefit all under heaven—no merit surpasses this.\n\n**1. Selling Grain at Fair Prices is the Greatest Convenience.**\nThe Celestial Master Han Ancestor taught that the foremost merit lies in saving others. Those with wealth, upon harvest, should broadly purchase and store grain, or if possessing fields, accumulate reserves. When scarcity arises, sell at the original price—no loss to oneself, yet immense benefit to others. Formerly, Huang Chengshi of Chengdu practiced this and was honored by the Purple Mansion Perfected Lord, Minister Zhang. He ascended to the immortal registers and enjoyed prosperity for generations. Alternatively, selling at a reduced price during lean times is even more commendable.\n\n**2. Relieving Illness is a Great Convenience.**\nIf one can devoutly prepare and distribute the *Ruyi Elixir* of the Perfected Lord Xu, it cures myriad ailments, especially swift in treating epidemics. Other efficacious medicines for distribution are also excellent, as is printing and disseminating proven remedies.\n\n**3. In summer, distribute water; in winter, provide clothing for the elderly and infirm. Show compassion to widows, orphans, the childless, and the solitary. Foster abandoned children. Supply coffins to the unburied. Relieve those in urgent distress or poverty as circumstances allow.**\n\n**4. Deliverance of the Deceased is of Small Cost but Great Merit.**\nMaster Ge the Immortal and Perfected Lord Sa attained transcendence through this, and all past immortals and masters have emphasized it. If one consistently performs sacrificial refinement, blessings extend to the departed. Even occasional fasting and food offerings confer no small benefit.\n\nEnlightened individuals and upright scholars, through exhaustive study and inquiry, awaken to the illusory nature of life and destiny and master the Dao of reversing water and fire. Not only do they transcend the mundane, but they also deliver the departed from the netherworld. The accumulation of deeds and merits begins here—one must seek a master’s guidance to avoid squandering effort.\n\n**5. The Suffering of Living Beings is Shared with Humans.**\nWhere possible, refrain from killing. Treat insects, birds, and beasts with equal compassion. The scriptures prescribe fasting and releasing life on the Three Officials’ days, for the Three Primes’ assessments deem all fasting as abstention from taking life.\n\n**6. Repairing bridges, mending roads, digging wells, clearing channels, promoting benefit, eliminating harm, exhorting goodness, resolving doubts, mediating disputes—all are acts of convenience.**\n\nFor the wealthy who practice such conveniences, their reach is vast, and their recompense abundant. Blessings and longevity increase, and their families enjoy lasting felicity. For Dao cultivators, this ensures both merit and practice are fulfilled, naturally encountering masters and attaining the Dao. For those of modest means, such deeds are especially difficult. As the Pure Nourishment Perfected One once said: *\"Of old, those who performed meritorious deeds could succor the world’s destitute. The wealthy find it easy to act, while the poor find it hard to emulate. Yet those who act where emulation is difficult achieve merit a hundredfold greater than the wealthy.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Mirror for Preserving Life in Newly Recovered Cases of Cold Damage, Febrile Diseases, and Convulsions**\n*Recorded by Ningchuan, the Daoist of Preserving Nurturance*\n\n**Epidemics share the same prohibitions.** The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* asks: *\"After recovering from cold damage or febrile illness, why do some symptoms linger?\"*\nQibo replied: *\"Eating meat causes relapse; overeating causes lingering illness. Lingering occurs when, despite intense heat, one forces food, allowing heat to hide and combine with grain qi. The two heats merge, causing residual symptoms—termed *food relapse*.\"*\nWang Qixuan explained: *\"When heat qi is not fully expelled, it lingers and afflicts the body. Relapse means falling ill again.\"*\n\n**Labor Relapse**\nAfter recent recovery from febrile illness, blood and qi are not yet restored, and residual heat remains. Premature exertion causes *labor relapse*.\n\n**Zhang Zhongjing’s Discussion on Yin-Yang Exchange in Cold Damage (Annotated by Cheng Wuji):**\nIf a man recently recovered but not fully restored engages in intercourse with a woman, the illness is called *yang exchange*. If a woman in the same state engages with a man, it is called *yin exchange*. The mutual stimulation of yin and yang, along with residual toxin transmission, resembles an exchange.\n\n**Sexual Relapse**\nThis refers to self-induced lust, also called *female labor relapse*. It depletes true qi internally and stirs pathogenic heat externally. With genuine deficiency and pathogenic excess, it becomes untreatable. Formerly, Gu Zixian, though recovered, did not heed Hua Fu’s cautions. Before death, his tongue protruded several inches—a warning not to be ignored.\n\n**External Injuries from Labor Relapse**\n- Combing hair too early inevitably causes head wind.\n- Washing the face too early leads to head dampness and heat.\n- Washing the feet too early results in foot numbness.\n- Bathing too early induces fever and stupor.\n- Agitation and anger cause abdominal masses.\n- Long journeys lead to weak, flaccid legs.\n- Overexertion causes hemiplegia.\n- Anxiety depletes qi.\n- Rising too early or straining the mind and body risks relapse.\n\n**Internal Injuries from Food Relapse**\n- Eating mutton causes relapse with fatal wheezing.\n- Eating sheep’s heart or lungs risks fatal relapse.\n- Eating sheep’s blood or liver causes severe diarrhea.\n- Eating beef leads to intractable dysentery.\n- Eating sheep or pig intestines causes chronic illness.\n- Eating horse meat is lethal.\n- Eating poultry too soon is lethal.\n- Eating beef liver causes unstoppable bloody diarrhea.\n- Eating dog meat induces fatal jaundice.\n- Eating roasted meat causes wasting-thirst.\n- Eating bone broth induces fever and bone steaming.\n- Eating rabbit meat causes heart disease.\n- Eating yellow beef causes unbreakable abdominal masses.\n- Eating chicken causes parasitic diseases.\n- Eating carp causes relapse.\n- Eating eel induces vomiting and dysentery.\n- Eating preserved fish causes jaundice.\n- Eating goose meat causes cholera.\n\nEating ark clams is lethal. Eating damp noodles induces damp-heat. Eating cucumbers or angled luffa causes fatal relapse. Eating eggplant induces malaria. Eating white hyacinth beans obstructs cold qi in the chest. Eating mallow causes blindness. Eating raw vegetables leads to fatal heart disease and irreversible complexion. Drinking wine too soon induces manic agitation. Drinking white liquor causes edema.\n\nDuring epidemic outbreaks, after sweating resolves the illness, drinking cold water harms the pericardium, leaving one debilitated and unrecovered. Master Sun’s *Treatise on Formulas* states: After recovering from febrile diseases or major illnesses, eating pork, sheep’s blood, fatty fish, or greasy foods will inevitably cause severe diarrhea, which physicians cannot cure and is fatal. Consuming pastries, glutinous millet, raw fish, roasted meats, malt sugar, crab, dried meats, preserved fruits, jujubes, chestnuts, peaches, apricots, plums, or other hard-to-digest foods—while the stomach qi remains weak and unable to transform them—will necessitate purgative medicine. Uncontrollable diarrhea may follow, and without purgation, death is certain. Even with purgation, recovery is perilous and difficult to save.\n\nBefore one hundred days have passed after recovery, when qi and strength have not yet returned, engaging in sexual activity is lethal; even the robust must abstain for sixty days. After recovery, one should only consume thin rice porridge, eating sparingly to maintain hunger and carefully avoiding satiety. No other foods should be eaten, even if craved. For thirst after sourness, one may take *Tianshui Powder*, or consume watermelon or water pears to quench thirst and dispel residual heat.\n\nHaving practiced medicine for over forty years and treated many patients, I invariably provide these prohibitions and dietary rules to those recovering from febrile illnesses, to prevent relapse.\n\nHerein I observe the ignorant and base among the common folk, who, relying on their innate robust constitutions or having suffered only mild afflictions, deem themselves fortunate to escape relapse and thus take such peril lightly, swayed by the misguided counsel of the multitude. They fail to grasp that one’s endowment of qi may wax or wane, that the severity of illness varies, and that reckless disregard—treating all cases alike—has led countless to their deaths.\n\nSome mothers, out of love for their children, or wives for their husbands, secretly indulge their cravings for food, valuing fleeting gustatory pleasure over life itself, thereby unwittingly hastening harm. Alas, such truths are fit to share with the discerning, yet difficult to impress upon the vulgar—thus must the wise exercise utmost caution.\n\nHaving distilled the wisdom of sages and worthies from their collected works, I have compiled these prohibitions and dietary rules, entitling them *The Mirror for Preserving Life*. The following must also be strictly avoided in cases of infantile pox and eruptive rashes, as well as during the ten perilous months of pregnancy:\n\n- The foul odor of fox-like armpit secretions\n- The noxious vapors of ditches and filthy channels\n- The turbid, lascivious qi of the bedchamber (especially after recent intercourse)\n- The menstrual qi and all manner of bloody, rank odors\n- The fumes of alcohol and the stench of meat or fish (inhaling the breath of a drunkard may drive pox toxin inward; if the child drinks wine, the toxin erupts outward)\n- The acrid vapors of sulfur-based mosquito repellents and other toxic substances (contact with these may cause red, painful eyes that resist healing)\n- The restless, impure qi of musk (inhaling it may draw pox toxin inward)\n- The steam and dampness of epidemic sweat (keep coriander nearby to counteract its miasma)\n- The stench of singed hair, fish bones, or other foul odors, as well as woodsmoke entering the mouth or nose\n- The pungent qi of onions, garlic, and leeks\n- The greasy fumes of frying oil\n\nThe above prohibitions are drawn from *The Complete Compendium for Infants* and must not be violated, lest complications arise—this I have witnessed firsthand.\n\nSome argue that peasant children, left to nature’s course, suffer no ill effects from such transgressions, attributing this to differences in social station and innate endowment. Yet this is not so.\n\nFor infantile pox desiring outward expression, prepare *Coriander Wine*: finely chop three liang of coriander, steep in two large cups of wine, and bring to a boil. Cover tightly to trap the vapors, then cool and strain. Lightly spray the child’s nape, back, chest, abdomen, and feet, avoiding the face and head. Place the lees in a pouch and hang it within the bed-curtains; the nursing mother may consume the remaining decoction.\n\nThe *Records of the Historian* states: \"There are six conditions that render illness incurable. The first is arrogance and self-indulgence, refusing to heed reason...\"\n\nThose who value wealth over life are the second incurable case; those unable to regulate clothing and diet are the third; those with concurrent depletion of yin and yang and visceral qi are the fourth; those too frail to take medicine are the fifth; and those who trust shamans but not physicians are the sixth.\n\n*Liu Hejian’s Poem on Nursing Infants*\nTo raise the young requires care and protection,\nAttend to them without indulgence or neglect.\nExcess milk will harm the stomach,\nStagnant food will injure the spleen.\nThick quilts bring no benefit,\nLight clothing is most suitable.\nExpose them often to sunlight, free from drafts,\nAnd follow the seasons in cold and heat.\n\n*Various Remedies for Eye Diseases*\n**General Formula for Dispersing, Deficiency, and Excess**\nFor detoxification, add:\n- 2 liang of *Sanguisorba* (Sang tree) *shengma*\n- 3 liang of *Paeonia lactiflora* *chishaoyao*\n- 2 liang of *Ligusticum chuanxiong*\n- 3 liang of *Bupleurum* *chaihu* (remove the nodes)\n- 3 liang of *Pueraria* *gan’ge*\n- 1 liang of *Scrophularia* *xuanshen* (remove the galls)\n- 1 liang of *Ligusticum sinense* *fuxiong*\n- ½ liang of *Scutellaria* *huangqin*\n- ½ liang of *Schizonepeta* *jingjie*\n- 1 liang of *Glycyrrhiza* *gancao*\n- ½ liang of *Atractylodes* *baizhu*\n- ½ liang of *Gardenia* *shanzhizi*\n- 1 liang of *Poria* *fuling*\n- A small amount of *Cassia obtusifolia* *caojue ming*\nBoil in plain water and take.\n\n**Qianghuo Powder for Heat**\n- 2 liang of *Saposhnikovia* *fangfeng*\n- 1 liang of *Notopterygium* *qianghuo*\n- 3 liang of *Paeonia lactiflora* *chishaoyao*\n- 1 liang of *Angelica dahurica* *baizhi*\n- 2 liang of *Ligusticum chuanxiong*\n- 1 liang of *Bupleurum* *chaihu*\n- ½ liang of *Alisma* *zexie*\n- ½ liang of *Stephania tetrandra* *fangji*\n- 1 liang of *Glycyrrhiza* *gancao*\n- 1 liang of *Schizonepeta* *jingjie*\n- 2 liang of *Poria* *fuling*\n- 1 liang of *Chrysanthemum* *juhua*\n- ½ liang of *Asarum* *xixin* (remove the leaves)\n- 1 liang of *Atractylodes* *baizhu*\n\n**Purgative Formula**\n- *Paeonia lactiflora* *chishaoyao*\n- *Scutellaria* *huangqin*\n- *Aurantium* *zhiqiao*\n- *Schizonepeta* *jingjie*\nBoil the above in equal parts, then steep *Rheum palmatum* *dahuang* and *Mirabilite* *poxiao* in the decoction.

Take at midday with tea to clear the head and eyes. Take before bed with wine to nourish liver blood.

Use the clear liquid to wash various types of corneal obstructions. Add *shigao* (*gypsum*), *ruxiang* (*frankincense*), and *qinpi* (*Fraxinus*) for festering wind.

Grind into powder, add *naozi* (*borneol*) and *shexiang* (*musk*), and apply.\n\n**Processed Xuanning Powder**\nExcellent for hot eyes and red eyes.\nTake one yellow ox gallbladder, fill with 2 *qian* of pure *poxiao* (*Mirabilite*) and 1 *qian* of *huanglian* (*Coptis*), and hang in the wind.

When I saw the sick, it was as if I myself were afflicted, and I frequently prepared medicines to distribute.\n\nOne day, my late father admonished me: \"Giving medicine to others is not as good as giving them formulas, for then the aid you provide will be far-reaching.\" Thereafter, whenever I obtained a verified formula, I shared it with those of benevolent intent.\n\nLater, I retreated into reclusion beyond the worldly realm, abandoning my former studies. Moreover, after enduring the dust and calamities of countless kalpas, all was reduced to ashes, leaving nothing behind. Only the *Collection of Verified External Medicine Formulas*—compiled by Yang Qingsou of Hechuan and transmitted to Wu Ningji, whose son Youzhang passed it to Master Li Shanguan of Xiping, who in turn entrusted it to me—remained. Its formulas are concise and essential, yet regrettably, it has never been printed. Thus, I preserved it alone.\n\nRecently, while traveling through the sacred land of Jinjing, I passed through Yudu. My disciple Xiao Tianni of Fenggang, a scion of a prominent family from Xichang, had studied the Dao at Ziyang Abbey for twenty years. He had previously accompanied me in my travels and was capable of summoning wind and rain to relieve droughts and floods—a testament to his deep karmic affinity with the Dao and his steadfast practice.\n\nHis fellow disciple, Liu Zhirou of Shunchuan, had suffered for years from sores and boils covering his body. He had taken *Jing Huang Tang*, *Bai Du San*, and other medicines, all to no avail. I therefore entrusted him with an external medicine formula, and after taking *Fan Hun Tang* for less than a full course, he was cured. Delighted, Tianni donated his own funds to have the text block-printed and distributed, so that its beneficent intent might circulate widely. In this, his response to prayers for rain or sunshine was indeed fitting.\n\nNevertheless, I recall an old friend who suffered from *guzhui* wind, enduring alternating chills and fever for months, bedridden and beyond the help of many physicians. Finally, a doctor examined him and said: \"Though this is a chronic ailment, there remains an exogenous pathogen in the Shaoyang channel that has not been resolved. If he has taken *Wu Ji San*, it would have been a mistake.\" Upon inquiry, this proved to be the case. The doctor then administered several doses of *Xiao Chai Hu Tang*, which promptly dispelled the chills and fever. He subsequently used this specialty’s *Zhui Feng Wan* and other medicines to address the wind disorder, leading to a full recovery.\n\nMiscellaneous illnesses have their formulas, and febrile disorders have their methods. Only when a physician masters both can they be deemed truly skilled. If one specializes solely in major formulas or external medicine, there is a risk of unknowingly making errors, which would hardly be perfect.\n\nThough the discussions of syndromes and prescriptions in this external medicine text are profoundly reasoned and superior to other formulas, those of discerning judgment must still exercise careful consideration when applying them in practice.\n\nWritten on the first day of the ninth month of the *wuwu* year of the Hongwu era,\nby Zhao Yizhen, Yuanyangzi of Junyi.\n\n---\n\nMedicine has long been esteemed as an art. Since the Divine Farmer Shennong first tasted the hundred herbs, distinguishing their warm, cool, cold, and hot natures to save the people from premature death, his merit has been unparalleled. Later, Bian Que and Hua Tuo mastered its techniques most exquisitely, their treatments and cures verging on the divine. Yet their arts were not fully transmitted. Today’s external medicine is but a remnant of their legacy.\n\nAmong external disorders, carbuncles and abscesses are the most severe. Abscesses differ in their yin-yang and deficiency-excess patterns; a slight error in medication can immediately lead to danger. Other conditions, such as nail-like sores and throat afflictions, are even more lethal. Though there are no shortage of external medicine practitioners in the world, few achieve true mastery.\n\nThe alchemist Zhao Yuanyang of Junyi, renowned for his erudition, inherited the teachings of the Laozi school. His Daoist practice was lofty and pure, surpassing his peers, and his heart was deeply committed to aiding others. He compiled rare and extraordinary medical texts into volumes, but most were lost in the chaos of war and fire. Only the external medicine formulas survived.\n\nIn the autumn of the *wuwu* year, he traveled with his book to Jinjing, lodging at Ziyang Abbey in Yudu—a place where, twenty years earlier, he had transmitted Daoist methods to the abbey’s adept, Xiao Fenggang. Upon his return, he cured Fenggang’s disciple Liu Shunchuan of a chronic, untreatable skin ailment. Fenggang then resolved to have the text printed to broaden its life-saving intent. However, Yudu’s remote valleys made it difficult to find craftsmen, and the project was delayed until the fifth month of the *rentu* year, when Yuanyang ascended as an immortal. Before his passing, he entrusted his disciples with the task of fulfilling his wish, compiling the secret formulas he had received into a single volume.\n\nYuanyang’s own preface, along with Fenggang’s donation for printing, reveals their utmost sincerity and benevolence. The circulation of this book will rescue those in peril and aid in emergencies, ensuring that all who are children may possess it and avoid the sin of filial impiety, and that all who are physicians may possess it and avoid the failing of heartlessness. Herein lies the heart of the benevolent and the filial.\n\nThus, I write this preface, that the diligence of its compilation may not be in vain.\n\nWritten in the *yangfu* month of the Hongwu era,\nby Wu Youren, Youlanfu of Luling.\n\n---\n\n**Immortal-Transmitted Secret External Medicine Formulas**\n*Volume One*\nCompiled by Zhao Yizhen, Yuanyangzi of Junyi.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface and Discourse on Abscesses, Carbuncles, and Dorsal Boils**\n*Section One*\n\nIn external medicine, abscesses and carbuncles are placed before all other ailments because their transformations occur in an instant, and life hangs by a thread.\n\nThough abscesses and carbuncles bear over twenty names, their essence reduces to two: the *yin* and *yang* patterns. Those arising from *yang* are called *yong* (abscesses), characterized by heat and excess; those from *yin* are called *ju* (carbuncles), marked by cold and deficiency.\n\nWhen *yang* erupts, the skin is thin, the color red, the swelling elevated, and often dotted with dozens of pinhole-like openings that cause pain. When *yin* erupts, the skin is thick, the color pale, the swelling hard—like the hide of an ox’s neck—and painless.\n\nThere are also *yin* within *yang*: seeming heat that is not true heat, swelling that is outwardly firm but inwardly deficient, redness without dryness, a desire to ache yet no pus, swelling that rises then subsides, and external fullness with internal flesh decay. And *yang* within *yin*: seeming cold that is not true cold, no swelling yet internal excess, faint redness with dryness, pus with pain, and though the exterior appears unremarkable, the interior is vexed and stifled.\n\nThose with *yin* within *yang* tend to be plump, their flesh taut but their interiors deficient. Those with *yang* within *yin* tend to be lean, their flesh slack but their interiors replete.\n\nMoreover, *yang* may transform into *yin* due to the misapplication of cooling herbs by inept physicians, while *yin* may shift to *yang* through the abrupt use of potent warming formulas. Yet when *yang* turns to *yin*, the condition is more common, and recovery—return to *yang*—remains possible, so survival is frequent. When *yin* turns to *yang*, the condition is rarer, and once lost, *yang* cannot be restored, so death is common. The rare survivors owe their lives to physicians who, by chance, apply the correct method—one in a hundred.\n\nThe term *eruption* refers to what accumulates within and manifests without. Generally, the entire human body is rooted in the five *zang*-organs, and the *qi* of the five *zang* all derive from the stomach’s *qi*. The stomach is the foundation of the five *zang*; it receives grain, and the spleen transforms it to generate *qi*. The spleen governs flesh and muscle, while the stomach’s *qi* transmits to the five *zang*, propelling blood and vessels to circulate through the channels and collaterals, completing a full cycle day and night.\n\nThough abscesses and carbuncles vary in deficiency, excess, cold, and heat, all arise from *qi* stagnation. Their causes are three: internal, external, and neither internal nor external.\n\nInternal causes are assessed at *renying* (the inch pulse on the left wrist, one *fen* before the bar). External causes are assessed at *qikou* (the inch pulse on the right wrist, one *fen* before the bar). If the pulses at *renying* and *qikou* are harmonious, the cause is neither internal nor external.\n\nTheir origins are five:\n1. Epidemic seasonal *qi*,\n2. Internal stagnation of the seven emotions,\n3. Constitutional deficiency with external contraction,\n4. Body heat contending with wind-cold,\n5. Consumption of roasted meats, strong wine, or alchemical minerals—all sources of heat toxin.\n\nFrom these five, pathogenic *qi* stagnates in the stomach. If the stomach’s *qi* is robust and the body replete, the pathogen contends with it, flowing into the channels and collaterals, obstructing where blood and vessels are sluggish, converging and congealing into abscesses. If the stomach’s *qi* is weak and the body deficient, the pathogen prevails, lodging in the channels and collaterals, coagulating and accumulating, causing blood and vessels to stagnate, leading to internal decay and carbuncles.\n\nThus it is said:\n- Outwardly like a millet grain, yet within it may hold a measure of grain;\n- Outwardly like a coin, yet within it may cradle a fist;\n- Vile toxin and pus-filled tracts, an inch long and deeply replete;\n- Pus and blood both withered—treatable with medicine;\n- Foul rot without strands, blood decayed and *qi* depleted;\n- Intestines severed, *yin* exuberant—even immortals cannot heal.\n\nIn treatment, the physician must gauge the patient’s deficiency or excess, discern the cold or heat of the illness, trace its cause, investigate its origin, and only then administer care. Internal and external must correspond; one cannot generalize.\n\nIf the illness erupts from *yang* with extreme heat, one should first regulate the *qi* and harmonize the blood. When *qi* is regulated, toxic *qi* disperses and does not stagnate; when blood is harmonized, vessels flow and the swelling naturally scatters. For *qi* is *yang*, blood is *yin*; when *yin* and *yang* are balanced, the patient is at ease.\n\nExternally, apply cooling medicines to stimulate it. If heat is severe, blood cools and scatters more readily. If it does not scatter, the heat will have abated, yet blood will congeal from the cold—this is the gradual shift from *yang* to *yin*, the root of putrefaction. One must swiftly return to cooling treatment, resolving the external attack on the surrounding blood pathways, draining the already-formed pus and toxin within, and then proceed according to method to achieve success.\n\nIf the illness erupts from *yin* with extreme cold, internally use balanced tonics to diffuse the *qi*, nourish the blood, and support the original *yang*, following the spleen and stomach. Wait until appetite returns and vitality revives, then regulate *qi* and harmonize blood as usual.\n\nExternally, apply warming medicines to mobilize the *qi* and blood throughout the body, revive dead flesh, and draw out toxic *qi*, then use mild warming medicines to disperse it. In cases of extreme cold, or those misled by cold medicines, one may resort to the *Three Revivers* to restore *yang*. The illness will then erupt laterally and recur—this is auspicious, a sign of *yin* transforming into *yang* and renewed life. If internal *yang* does not return and external signs do not appear, this is solitary *yang* severed from *yin*—beyond remedy.\n\nFor *yang* is *qi*, and *yin* is blood. When *yang* moves, *yin* follows; when *qi* circulates, blood flows. If *qi* does not circulate, blood dies; if blood dies, flesh dies; if flesh dies, the illness is fatal.\n\nIn cold patterns, warming medicines are used simply to move *qi* and blood. For blood and *qi* move when warmed and halt when cooled.\n\nThough the skillful use of cooling and warming medicines is essential, one must first administer frankincense and mung bean powder to rescue the heart and protect the membrane. The heart governs the entire body, and the membrane encases the five *zang*. At the onset of illness, toxin invariably attacks the pericardium. Thus, some first experience retching, then abscesses or carbuncles; others first develop abscesses or carbuncles, then retching—because the pericardium’s root lies in the heart.",

      "translated_text": "If treatment is delayed, the *pericardium*—the heart’s sovereign—suffers from toxin, and the spirit has no refuge; the primordial *qi* then falls into darkness. At the onset of illness, toxin invariably corrodes the flesh at the periphery. If treatment is delayed, the toxic *qi* penetrates the membrane; once the membrane is breached, the primordial *qi* leaks away, the *zang-fu* lose their nourishment, the spirit withers, and the pulse collapses entirely.\n\nThus, those who survive even severe illness are those in whom the five *zang* remain visible and the membrane intact. Yet some die from seemingly minor afflictions—where the flesh has not yet ulcerated but the membrane has already been breached. This is why rescuing the heart and protecting the membrane is the foremost principle.\n\nThis formula was secretly transmitted by immortals, its divine and ingenious workings beyond full description—far beyond the reach of ordinary physicians who rely on mere herbs, needles, or blades.

Prepare as a decoction with water and wine, adjusting the ratio according to the pattern. For *liu-zhu* (migratory abscesses), add *Du Huo*.\n\n**Dosage:** Four *qian* per dose. For illnesses in the upper body, take after meals; for those in the lower body, take before meals.\n\nThis single remedy is indispensable for *liu-zhu*, *yong-ju* (deep-rooted abscesses), *fa-bei* (back carbuncles), and traumatic fractures. It alone can rescue moribund conditions, revive dead flesh, quell crises before they arise, and eradicate roots after recovery. Its sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy ingredients interact like the four seasons and five phases, waxing and waning in succession—truly an immortal’s miraculous formula. With appropriate modifications, its efficacy is boundless.\n\nWhy? Because this medicine powerfully harmonizes *qi* and regulates blood. *Qi* is *yang*; blood is *yin*. When *yang* moves, *yin* follows; when *qi* circulates, blood flows. If *yang* stagnates, *yin* congeals; if *qi* weakens, blood dies. When blood dies, flesh dies; when flesh dies, the illness is invariably fatal. Thus, one must regulate *yang* and harmonize *yin*—neither can be neglected.\n\nIf only *yang* is regulated without harmonizing *yin*, *qi* dissipates and blood congeals, leaving the flesh lifeless—like the *Wu-Xiang Lian-Qiao* formulas. If only *yin* is harmonized without regulating *yang*, blood flourishes while *qi* weakens, and the illness will recur—like the *Nei-Bu Shi-Xuan* formulas. Yet these two approaches may also be used in combination; rigidity yields no miracles. This formula fortifies the stomach’s root, spares the primordial *qi*, and scours away pathogenic filth, naturally restoring smooth circulation without giving rise to complications—truly an immortal’s elixir.\n\n**Applications and Modifications:**\n\n1. **For long-standing *fa-bei* (back carbuncles) that fail to heal:**\n   This is due to prior excessive use of cooling medicines, which internally injure the spleen and externally freeze the blood. The spleen governs flesh; when it is damaged, appetite wanes, complexion withers, and flesh fails to regenerate. Blood fills the vessels; when it is frozen, *qi* loses its vigor, and flesh putrefies. Thus, the spleen must be regulated—once it is strong, flesh will regenerate. In this formula, remove *Mu Tong*, reduce *Dang Gui*, and double the amounts of *Hou Po* and *Chen Pi*. For severe cases, use the family’s *Dui-Jin Yin-Zi*; for even graver cases, add *Bai Dou-Kou* and the like.\n\n2. **For *liu-zhu* (migratory abscesses):**\n   Add *Du Huo*. *Liu-zhu* arises from *qi* and blood stagnation; when *qi* flows and stagnates, blood pools and congeals. This herb can invigorate the entire body’s blood vessels—once the vessels move, how can *liu-zhu* persist?\n\n3. **For *liu-zhu* arising from *shang-han* (cold damage):**\n   If the exterior has not fully resolved, residual toxin flows into the four limbs’ channels and collaterals, lodging where it stagnates and forming *liu-zhu*.\n   - If the illness still presents tidal fever, the interior retains unresolved cold evil. To this formula, add *Sheng Ma* and *Su Ye*.\n   - If fever persists after taking this, add *Gan Ge*.\n   - If headache is present, add *Chuan Xiong* and decoct with ginger water.\n   - If no tidal fever is present, decoct with equal parts water and wine, as wine powerfully moves blood and generates *qi*. When *qi* is generated and blood flows, recovery is assured.\n\n   Why must *liu-zhu* be treated with exterior-resolving methods? To trace the cause, investigate the source, and not forget the illness’s root. Once cold evil is fully expelled, over-releasing the exterior may lead to *cold liu-zhu*, which is even more difficult to treat. Thus, mild exterior resolution is optimal.\n\n   After releasing the exterior, the second stage calls for warm, neutral medicines—such as *Shi-Xuan* or *Nei-Bu*. If ineffective, the third stage may require adding *Fu-Zi* or administering several doses of *Si-Zhu San*. However, warming medicines must not be overused, lest they exacerbate suffering and prevent pus and blood from drying.\n\n   The fourth stage returns to the original formula to achieve resolution.\n\n   If the exterior is not fully resolved, residual toxin may attach to the bone, forming *gu-yong* (bone abscess). *Liu-zhu* is the remnant toxin of *shang-han*; *gu-yong* is the deteriorated pattern of *liu-zhu*. *Liu-zhu* is not the fault of *shang-han*, but of the physician’s incomplete exterior resolution. *Gu-yong* is not the fault of *liu-zhu*, but of the quack’s excessive use of cooling medicines.\n\n   Quacks, blind in mind and deaf in intent, falsely claim clairvoyance. Even when they recognize *gu-yong*, their treatments lack method. They recklessly administer cooling medicines and apply caustic blades, causing toxic *qi* to stagnate. Cooling medicines and metal instruments drive the toxin deeper into the bone, making it incurable.\n\n   Otherwise, how could human bones develop abscesses? Once bone becomes abscessed, no medicine can cure it—hence the names *fu-gu-ju* (bone-attaching carbuncle) and *bai-hu-fei-shi* (white tiger flying corpse). It lingers for years, shifting and turning, until the cold toxin and decayed bone are fully expelled before healing occurs.",
      "overlap_context": "\n\nThough the skillful use of cooling and warming medicines is essential, one must first administer frankincense and mung bean powder to rescue the heart and protect the membrane. The heart governs the entire body, and the membrane encases the five *zang*. At the onset of illness, toxin invariably attacks the pericardium. Thus, some first experience retching, then abscesses or carbuncles; others first develop abscesses or carbuncles, then retching—because the pericardium’s root lies in the heart.",

      "translated_text": "Those that do not heal may persist for a lifetime—all due to initial mismanagement. When the bone decays, if it is an accessory bone, recovery is still possible; but if it is a primary bone, the condition becomes a lifelong disability.\n\nWhen the pus is white and thin, the fragmented bone has just begun to detach, and probing the flesh to retrieve it is difficult. When the pus is yellow and thick, the fragmented bone is about to emerge, and the flesh is shallow enough for retrieval—this should be done with a sharp blade. Details are provided in later chapters. This, however, is but a general outline of treating *gu-yong*.\n\nThere are also cases where the illness has persisted for months, injured by blades, leaving the patient emaciated, limbs contracted, coughing up pus and blood, with decayed flesh and yin putrefaction. This arises from extreme cold, yang weakness, and yin excess—it must not be mistaken for heat due to blood in the sputum. It should be treated with modified formulas containing high-quality *fuzi*.\n\nOther cases begin with toxin arising in the hands, feet, head, or face, causing pain throughout the body, ascending to the neck. Where the meridians converge, the sores resemble strings of pearls—this is a condition of wind-dampness and *qi* stagnation. It should be treated with modified *Xiao Xuming Tang* and *Du Huo Jisheng Tang*, used in conjunction with this formula.\n\nThere are also cases where pain begins in both knees and spreads to all joints, resembling \"blood wind\" in women and \"soft wind\" in men—this is called *fengshi bi* (wind-damp impediment) or *li-jie* (pervasive node). It should be treated with modified *Fuzi Ba Wu Tang*.\n\nWhen abscesses form in the neck, armpits, beside the breasts, or in the soft flesh of the hips, they are called *chenjing yong* (cold abscesses). These are cold conditions without heat and should be treated with *Nei Bu Shi Xuan San*, used in conjunction with this formula. For children, *fuzi* must not be used lightly, lest it provoke fright seizures. Under no circumstances should needles or blades be applied. With thin blood and no pus, the flesh is reluctant to knit—apply warming, damp-dispersing medicines to resolve it internally. If needles or blades are mistakenly used, causing proud flesh to form, this same medicine will still achieve results. Should mild pain or slight seizures occur during treatment, use modified *Quan Xie Guanyin San*. Once the fright subsides, resume the original prescription.\n\nThere are also children with long-standing phlegm misdirected by illness, manifesting abscesses on the neck, arms, chest, or back—this is extreme cold, and success depends entirely on the application of warming medicines. Leaving an opening is preferable, as the condition may require further intervention; treatment methods follow later.\n\nThere is also *liuzhu* as large as a gourd or an overturned bowl appearing on the chest or back. Its symptoms resemble *fa* (effusion) but are far more severe. After administering medicine, if the form and momentum show even the slightest movement, it is no longer *fa*. It should be treated with *Nei Bu Shi Xuan* in conjunction with this formula, adjusted according to the condition, to resolve it internally.\n\nGenerally, all such conditions originate from cold. Where there is pain, it is bone pain—bone being the surplus of the kidney. When the kidney is deficient, the bone becomes cold, and cold bone is the cause of pain. The term *gu-ju* (bone carbuncle) arises from the kidney because its root lies there. Thus, to tonify the kidney, only large doses of *fuzi* can be effective. When the kidney is replete, the bone regains its vitality, and carbuncles will not attach to the bone.\n\nIn administering medicine, one must not be rigid but adaptable. Generally, when *yong* (abscesses) and *ju* (carbuncles) first emerge, they form from *qi* and blood stagnation. Over time, blood accumulates at the site of stagnation, eventually erupting. In patients with abundant *qi* and blood, *danggui* should be reduced in this formula, for excess generates blood, which may cause abscesses to form elsewhere, leading to endless recurrence. This is a secret transmission, rarely known to physicians.\n\nThere are two types of phlegm associated with *yong* and *ju*:\n1. Stomach cold generating phlegm—add *banxia* to this formula to fortify the spleen and transform phlegm.\n2. Heat constraint forming wind-phlegm—add *jiegeng* to this formula to dissolve phlegm in the throat and diaphragm, and decoct with fresh ginger in a mixture of water and wine.\n\nFor *nao-fa* (brain effusion) or *bei-fa* (back effusion) occurring above, remove *mutong* from this formula, lest it drain the lower *yuan*, complicating treatment for conditions of upper excess and lower deficiency. The elderly and weak should especially avoid it.\n\nIf the patient has diarrhea, this formula must not be used immediately. First, administer an antidiarrheal: dissolve raw *baifan* into powder, mix with melted yellow wax to form pills, and take thirty with rice water. Only after the diarrhea ceases should this medicine be used. The human body relies on *qi* and blood as its foundation. In those with abscesses, *qi* and blood surge to one place to form pus. If the viscera are not secure, *yuan-qi* will leak, and the blood will grow colder, making recovery difficult. This formula strongly regulates *qi*.\n\nGenerally, when *qi* flows smoothly, blood circulates; when *qi* is depleted, blood turns cold; when *qi* is cold, blood dies; and when blood dies, flesh does not regenerate. Applying warming medicines may fail to generate flesh if *yuan-qi* is insufficient to sustain it, only adding to suffering. Applying cooling medicines is entirely misguided.\n\nThough this formula was divinely transmitted, its efficacy depends on proper use—otherwise, one risks the folly of \"marking the boat to find the sword.\" As for *liuzhu*, it cannot be treated uniformly. If cooling medicines deplete and scatter *yuan-qi*, some cases may respond to *San Jian*, for such illnesses often stem from cold. One must carefully examine the pulse and differentiate the condition, confirming its cold origin before using such medicines—yet even then, excess is harmful. When the yang pulse revives, the swollen area turns red and lively, and the bone regains vitality, cold *qi* will no longer attach to form carbuncles. At that point, credit the original formula for its success—this is the infallible method.\n\nThis medicine may be prepared as a decoction, powder, or pill, with water or wine as the vehicle, chosen as circumstances dictate. For the affluent, coat it with *muxiang*. If the patient has heat-phlegm and cough, the wealthy may take it with *chenxiang*, the poor with *suye* decoction. For pills, use honey as the binder.\n\nThis formula is not only for treating *yong*, *ju*, *fa-bei* (effusion of the back), and fractures—it is also effective for men and women with *shan-qi* (hernia) or blood *qi* conditions, with repeated success. There was a woman who suffered from a *qi* illness for five years. When it flared, she experienced only lump pain, retching, and an inability to keep down water or food. Each episode brought her near death. She took this medicine as pills with *muxiang* decoction...",

      "translated_text": "A single dose stops the retching; a second dose harmonizes phlegm and qi, and she was cured.\n\nAll cases of fractures and injuries invariably rely on this formula, though adjustments in additions and subtractions vary—details are found in the section on fractures and injuries. For common bruises, breaks, or damage, including injury to the pericardium, it treats all. If the injury is on the head, remove *mutong* and *zhike*, and add *chuanxiong* and *chenpi*. Routinely adding *dingpi* and *suye* activates blood; adding *poguzhi* and *wulingshi* breaks up static blood. Boil the decoction thoroughly, then steep it in a cup of strong wine. When it boils again, add *dahuang* powder and take it on an empty stomach. If the bowels move smoothly, only four doses are needed: the first two include *dahuang* powder, while the latter two omit it, merely promoting descent. If the bowels do not move, use *zhike* decoction to stimulate them continuously. If still no movement occurs, the condition is untreatable. One must not sit idly by while a person dies without knowing why. Consider formulas like *Buxue Shixuan San* and others.\n\nFor all fractures and injuries, this formula may omit *mutong* and be called *Heshouwu San*, as *heshouwu* supports blood. For blade wounds with tidal fever, facial swelling, and panting—signs of *poshangfeng* (tetanus)—take *Suoxue San* and *Gegen Tang* for several doses, or decoct *jiang* and *cong* for dispersing, or take *Baidusan* three or four times. Externally, apply topical medicines according to method; none will fail to heal.\n\nFor chronic lumbar pain, add *caobixie* and *xuanhusuo*, and decoct with wine. For *jiaoqi* (leg qi), add *binglang*, *mugua*, and *chuanshanjia*, and decoct with water.\n\nPhlegm that has lost its proper path is not only unrecognized by others but, since its transmission from the immortals, only my lineage has known of it. Phlegm lubricates the entire body like a fish’s slime. When phlegm resides in the stomach and remains still, there is no illness; when it stirs, a hundred diseases arise—wheezing, coughing, retching, dizziness, headaches, eye pain, generalized stiffness, and painful joints are all caused by newly accumulated phlegm, formed from the败浊 congealing of blood and qi. Why? When the qi of the viscera and bowels rebels and stagnates, phlegm is born; when sweat should be released but is not, phlegm accumulates; when food and drink are overconsumed, fluids fail to move and gather into phlegm. Normally, phlegm travels from the stomach cavity to the lung tract and exits. When it loses its path, it scatters from the stomach cavity into the cold flesh, muscles, and skin. The spleen governs muscles, and the lungs govern skin and hair, so phlegm may lodge in the chest, back, head, neck, armpits, hips, waist, legs, hands, or feet, forming hard lumps—painful or painless—with no flush of blood upon pressure. Even if slightly red, the color is pale and cool, hard as stone. When broken, there is no pus, only thin blood, clear fluid, or milky liquid; sometimes, spoiled flesh resembles torn cotton, or like scrofula nestled in the skin and flesh, resembling a parrot’s egg floating in water—movable, soft, and not hard. When pierced, no pus or blood emerges, and the wound gapes with protruding flesh. The only sensation is phlegm obstructing the throat, with alternating chills and fever—these are its signs. Urgently add *nanxing* and *banxia* to this formula to treat internally, and externally apply *Yulong* hot medicine to draw out the toxin, allowing it to form pus and rupture for the best outcome. In milder cases without pus, it will resolve internally. If heat is extreme and phlegm congested, use *Kongxian Dan*—equal parts *zidaji*, *gansui*, and *baijiezi*—ground into powder and made into pills with rice paste.\n\nIf hard lumps the size of cups or bowls appear in critical areas like the throat or neck, the condition is especially difficult to treat. When blood and qi flow harmoniously, no other illness arises; when qi flows improperly, blood transforms into phlegm. If phlegm further loses its path, blood and qi decline and fail to form pus, only producing swelling and hardness—this is inevitable. This syndrome involves more yin than yang, so treat according to the pattern: restore yang, generate qi, supplement blood, and expel phlegm. Externally, use subsequent methods to rouse the body’s qi and blood and disperse cold lumps. If swelling does not subside, causes no pain, generates no heat, the body’s qi is robust, and no other symptoms appear, yet the flesh lump is indistinguishable from healthy tissue—this is another condition. Under no circumstances should one rashly use needles or blades to harm oneself. If a quack has already used needles, moxibustion, or corrosive medicines to rot the flesh, causing alternating chills and high fever, the proper approach is to harmonize and unblock qi and blood. Add *shengma* to this formula to dispel cold evil, and use wound-closing, scab-forming medicines to stabilize it, reducing it to a mere wart or growth. If the disease itself festers and rots, unavoidably requiring a blade, there is a marvelous preparation that can replace the knife—do not casually reveal it: mix *baifan* and *kupohua* into powder and apply it.\n\nFor intestinal abscesses within the abdomen, take *Shixuan San* alternately with this formula, adding *rendongteng*, which is most effective for internal abscesses. One must carefully assess deficiency and excess—whether to unblock or supplement. For supplementation, use *fuzi*; for unblocking, use *dahuang*. If deficiency and excess are unclear, this formula naturally harmonizes and unblocks, while *Shixuan* inherently supplements internally, preventing other complications.\n\nFor lung abscesses, the first signs are difficulty eating and slight pain in the chest and diaphragm—this is the condition. Immediately examine the pulse and assess deficiency or excess. If deficient, use this formula with *fuzi*, adjusting as needed. If the condition worsens slightly, use *Shixuan San* to supplement internally, and it will resolve. If excess, use this formula with *dahuang* to slightly unblock, allowing the toxic qi to descend—this is optimal. The lung and large intestine are exterior-interior related. If an internal abscess has already formed, combine *Haishang Fang* with this formula, adjusting as needed.\n\nWheezing, coughing, and expectorating pus and blood indicate a lung abscess. If pus exits through the navel in the stool, it is an abdominal abscess.",

The Ming-dynasty printed edition omits this.\n2. The Ming edition reads \"方\" (*formula*).\n3. The Ming edition reads \"尖\" (*tip*).\n\n---\n\n**Volume Two of the Immortal-Transmitted Secret External Medicine Formulas**\n*Compiled by Zhao Yizhen, the Original Yang Master of Junyi*\n\n**Category: Warm Medicinal Formulas for Application**\n\n**#3: Harmonizing Immortal Paste (also called Yellow Cloud Paste or Immortal Paste)**\n*Used for conditions where cold and heat are indistinct; may be mixed with tea or wine according to the syndrome.*\n\n- **Sichuan red-barked catalpa** (*chuan zi ke pi*), 5 *liang* in weight, stir-fried (also called *red flesh*)\n  - *Also called* \"internal disperser\"\n- **Red peony root** (*chi shao yao*), 2 *liang*, stir-fried\n- **Pubescent angelica root** (*du huo*), 3 *liang*, stir-fried (do not use the nodes)\n- **Dahurian angelica root** (*bai zhi*), 1 *liang* (do not expose to fire)\n- **Wood wax** (*mu la*), also called *wang jian xiao* or *yang chun xue* (adjust according to need), stir-fried (this is *shi chang pu*, *Acorus tatarinowii*)\n\nGrind the above five ingredients into a fine powder; detailed instructions for use follow.\n\nAll abscesses, deep-rooted ulcers, *liuzhu* (migratory abscesses), and miscellaneous diseases arise from stagnation of *qi* and blood. When exposed to warmth, they live; when exposed to cold, they die. Living, they disperse; dying, they congeal. This formula is warm and balanced.\n\n- **Red-barked catalpa** is the essence of wood; it breaks *qi*, dispels blood, and resolves swelling.\n- **Pubescent angelica root** is the essence of earth; it arrests wind, mobilizes blood, draws out bone toxins, dispels numbness and dampness, and, together with wood wax, breaks stony hardness.\n- **Red peony root** is the essence of fire; it mildly generates blood, relieves pain, and dispels wind.\n- **Wood wax** is the essence of water; it generates blood, relieves pain, resolves swelling, breaks wind, and disperses blood.\n- **Dahurian angelica root** is the essence of metal; it dispels wind, generates flesh, and relieves pain.\n\nWhen blood is generated, it does not die; when blood moves, it flows freely. When flesh is generated, it does not rot; when pain ceases, it does not fester. When wind departs, blood naturally disperses; when *qi* is broken, hardness dissolves, and toxins scatter. With these five agents working in concert, how could the disease fail to be cured?\n\n---\n\nAll diseases manifest in three syndromes, and treatment employs three methods.\n\n- If the disease is extremely hot, double the amounts of red-barked catalpa and wood wax in this formula, and slightly reduce the other three ingredients. It will still disperse, though more slowly.\n- If the disease is extremely cold, slightly increase red peony root and pubescent angelica root; this will activate blood and disperse the condition, though the effect will be somewhat delayed without harming the disease.\n\n---\n\n- If the disease’s heat is overwhelming, do not use wine to mix the medicine. Instead, steep scallions in hot water to prepare a decoction, then mix the medicine and apply it warm. Scallions also disperse *qi*, and blood flows when warmed—hence the use of warm application.\n- Once the disease has slightly abated, return to using wine to mix the medicine. Wine generates blood, and when warmed, blood is further generated. Wine also mobilizes blood, and when warmed, blood flows more freely.\n\n---\n\n- If the sore surface develops blood blisters or small sores, do not use wood wax, as its drying nature may cause discomfort when the medicine is applied. First apply the other four ingredients, then cover with wood wax to encircle and cut off the attacking blood pathways.\n- When applying medicine, always apply it warm. If it dries, moisten it again with the original decoction to keep the medicinal properties damp and steaming, allowing the disease to recede.\n\n---\n\n- If, when using the standard formula, the black halo around the sore does not recede and the sore’s opening lacks blood color, it indicates the patient has previously used excessive cold medicine. Do not immediately apply *Yulong* (Jade Dragon), as the flesh is not yet dead, and the strong medicinal force may increase suffering. Instead, add cinnamon bark (*rou gui*) and Chinese angelica (*dang gui*) to this formula to revive the dead blood. The black halo will naturally recede, and efficacy will appear. Once the blood returns, discontinue the additions and use only the standard formula to achieve results.\n\n---\n\n- If pain persists when using the standard formula, dissolve frankincense (*ru xiang*) and myrrh (*mo yao*) in wine over a fire, then mix this wine with the medicine and apply it warm to relieve pain.\n\n---\n\n- For *liuzhu* (migratory abscesses) where the sinews fail to extend, add frankincense to this formula and apply it; its nature promotes sinew extension.\n\n---\n\n- If the sore’s opening develops protruding red flesh, there are three possible causes: (1) exposure to water, (2) exposure to wind, or (3) inversion of the wound edges after a knife incision.\n  - Add a small amount of *arisaema* (*nan xing*) to dispel wind, and mix the medicine with ginger juice and wine.\n  - If it does not resolve, the condition likely arose because an unskilled physician pressed out the pus core too forcefully and then applied cold medicine to the skin, causing this outcome. If hot medicine is applied, it will further rot the flesh. There is a secret method for this: apply a powder of alum (*bai fan*) and dried ginger (*ku po xiao*), then dust with sulfur (*liu huang*). Internally, administer *Rong Wei Jia Dui Jin Yin* (Nourishing and Defending Decoction with Paired Metal), and externally apply *Chong He* (Harmonizing Immortal Paste).\n\n---\n\n- If the disease’s heat is severe, do not immediately use cold medicine. Excessive heat causes *qi* and blood to congest, and extreme cold causes blood to retreat incompletely, congealing due to cold. Thus, use a balanced combination of warm and cool. Add *Dui Ting Hong Bao Dan* (Balanced Treasure Elixir) to this formula, mix with scallion decoction, and apply.\n\n---\n\nThis formula is the foremost medicine for *fabei* (carbuncles of the back) and *liuzhu* (migratory abscesses). Scholars should master its flexible application, aligning internal and external treatments so that the disease remains within their grasp.\n\nHowever, severe *fabei* is a matter of life and death, and only this formula offers the most stable and reliable efficacy from beginning to end, with no risk of deterioration. In mild cases, even folk healers may achieve results, though complications and harmful consequences may arise. This is because *fabei* arising from *yin* cannot be treated by folk healers. How could any other formula compare to this one, which treats both *yin* and *yang* conditions and seizes the divine power of creation?\n\nAs for *liuzhu*, though it is not fatal, nine out of ten cases result in disability. Prolonged disability leads to death, and even if a physician can cure it, recovery typically takes half a year to a full year.",

If excess, use this formula with *dahuang* to slightly unblock, allowing the toxic qi to descend—this is optimal. The lung and large intestine are exterior-interior related.

      "translated_text": "This occurs in but one out of a hundred cases—yet the body remains feeble and impaired. Only the immortal formulas of our lineage, with their extraordinary and swift efficacy, never fail even once, possessing the power to snatch life from the jaws of death—effects beyond full description in words.\n\nNow, *liuzhu* arises from residual toxins of *shanghan*. When the exterior has not fully resolved, these toxins lodge in the channels and network vessels. If qi and blood become uneven, they transform into *heat-liuzhu*. Those cases physicians can cure are the heat type. Heat diseases rarely involve excessive exterior dispersion, but when qi and blood are depleted, residual toxins flow into the interstices—whether loose or tight—and become *cold-liuzhu*. These are the cases physicians find difficult to cure.\n\nCold diseases are far more common. Thus, when *shanghan*’s exterior has not fully resolved, it is not merely a heat pattern; its residual toxins often manifest as cold patterns, leading to cold paralysis. When rooted in kidney deficiency, it produces *guju*. Cold causes qi to stagnate further and blood to congeal, resulting only in swelling without suppuration. If a physician administers cold formulas, they \"cool what is already cold,\" and *yin* dies within *yin*, leading only to putrefying flesh, bone-bound toxins, and *guying*—ultimately, disability. Thus, *guying* is the failed outcome of *liuzhu*.\n\nYet it is said: *guying* is not the fault of *liuzhu*, but the error of physicians who prescribe cooling remedies.

      "translated_text": "When qi flows and stagnates, blood congeals where it settles. Qi is yang; blood is yin. When yang moves, yin follows; when qi circulates, blood flows. The reason we can shift *liuzhu* to another location and disperse it lies precisely in its capacity for movement. Where movement occurs, displacement follows—once yang has moved and stirred, how can yin remain stagnant and not follow? Thus, we employ *duhuo* to guide it, for its nature is to stir and agitate both qi and blood. Once guided into motion, yin and yang harmonize, preventing suppuration and dispersing the condition at the new site—an inevitable outcome.\n\nWhen *liuzhu* arises in critical areas such as the back, shoulders, waist, or legs, apply this formula thickly to the affected site. Then, use *duhuo* powder alone, mixed with wine and applied hot along a single path, leading to its endpoint where *yulong* is applied—this is the method of displacement. It directs the blood and qi to another location, causing them to gather and suppurate in a non-critical area. Alternatively, it may be resolved entirely. If pus has already formed, displacement is no longer possible; instead, apply this medicine urgently to draw out the toxins and prevent the development of *guying*. When incompetent physicians use cooling remedies or improperly employ needles and blades, *guying* forms—a condition not curable by medicine, requiring only that the decayed bone be expelled before healing can occur. If one hesitates to use needles or blades to extract it, apply *yulong*; the treatment method follows later. If the primary bone is expelled, no remedy exists; if a secondary bone is expelled, recovery is possible.\n\nOne formula uses *baizhi* and *zijinpi*, mixed with wine, to internally resolve early-stage abscesses—named *Yisheng Gao*. Another formula employs *chishaoyao*, *mola*, and *zishengpi* as a binding medicine—named *Sansheng Gao*. Another method treats adults or children who have accidentally severed their tongues with a blade, where the tongue hangs but remains partially attached: wrap the tongue in the soft inner membrane of a chicken egg, apply *Poxue Dan* mixed with honey to the root of the tongue to stanch bleeding, then blend honey and wax to an appropriate consistency, incorporating this primary formula. Apply it to the chicken membrane, as its softness and thinness allow the medicine to penetrate. If the tongue remains in the mouth, frequently reapply the melted mixture. After three days, the tongue will reattach, at which point the chicken membrane may be removed, and only the honey-wax mixture with the medicine need be applied diligently. Full recovery occurs within seven days. Those who study this will understand the marvelous applications of adaptable methods, which do not rely solely on the transmission of a teacher. If rapid results are not achieved, combine with *jinchuang* remedies for even greater efficacy.\n\nFor abscesses that have not yet formed pus, do not immediately apply *Hongbao Dan* to the head of the swelling, lest the cold medicine freeze the blood, preventing resolution and suppuration while causing flesh to rot. Instead, apply this formula. If the swelling does not resolve and suppuration is desired, apply *yulong* to the head of the abscess to dry it. Then, place this primary formula beneath the *yulong*, encircling the abscess with *Hongbao Dan* to block the influx of fresh blood. If the condition has not been excessively chilled by cooling medicines, there is no need to apply this formula beneath the *yulong*; simply encircle the abscess with *Hongbao Dan*.\n\nWhen treating severe or deteriorating conditions, if *yulong* cannot yet be applied, use this formula alone for stability and to spare the patient distress. For nascent *fabei* that has not yet formed, apply *zijinpi* powder mixed with wine as a binding agent to naturally constrict and prevent spreading. Internally, administer *Zuomu Yinzi*—an excellent remedy for the impoverished.\n\nAdding two-thirds parts *nanxing* and *caowu* to this formula, mixed with hot wine and applied, can cause any abscess to suppurate painlessly. Using *yulong* alone requires *Hongbao Dan* to encircle it, but this method is superior. For rabid dog bites, apply *zijiao* mixed with brown sugar, leaving the wound open. Use *jindan* to reduce swelling, and place chewed apricot kernels in the wound to draw out toxins.\n\nAnother method combines equal parts *nanxing* and *caowu* with this formula, mixed with hot wine and applied, to treat long-standing injuries—most effective. For soft nodules in children, add *junjiang* to this formula, mixed with wine and applied. If applied at the onset, this formula alone, mixed with wine, will suffice until pus forms. At the initial stage, applying *zijinpi* and *mola* mixed with wine can ensure resolution; under no circumstances should *Hongbao Dan* be used.\n\n*Biaoju* arises from heart-fire and heat toxins, manifesting in the five centers with unbearable pain. Its appearance resembles blistering sores with red blood, and though its external form is small, the internal heat toxin is severe. If located in the heart or diaphragm, it is difficult to treat; if in the palms or soles, it may be cured. However, treatment must be prompt—delay or localization in the heart or diaphragm leads to putrefied, pulverized flesh, beyond even the aid of immortals. For this condition in the palm, apply *Hongbao Dan* in a ring around the palm to block the blood, then use *Zhonghe* at the center, leaving an opening to complete the treatment. For the sole, apply *Hongbao* along the foot’s meridian at the *jiaogu* bone, encircling an area one to two *cun* in length, then use *Chonghe* as before to conclude. *Xianchuan Waike Mifang*, Scroll Two, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Scroll Three of *Xianchuan Waike Mifang*\nCompiled by Zhao Yizhen of Junyi Yuanchang**\n\n**Section Four: Topical Applications of Heating Medicines**\n\n**Huanyang Yulong Ointment (Yang-Returning Jade Dragon Ointment), Hot in Nature**\n- *Cao Wu* (wild aconite), 3 *liang*, stir-fried\n- *Nan Xing* (arisaema), 1 *liang*, roasted\n- *Jun Jiang* (ginger), 2 *liang*, roasted\n- *Bai Zhi* (angelica), 1 *liang*, unheated\n- *Chi Shao Yao* (red peony), 1 *liang*, stir-fried\n- *Rou Gui* (cassia bark), ½ *liang*, unheated\n\nThis formula treats yin-type *fabei* (back carbuncles), cold *liuzhu* (flowing phlegm), *guzhui* wind (drumstick wind), chronic traumatic pain, cold impediment with wind-damp, all cases of cold leg qi with swelling but no redness, cold pain without swelling, numbness of the feet, and cold blood wind in women—it is the foremost medicine for all yin patterns.\n\n**Usage** is detailed below; apply mixed with warm wine.\n\nThough miscellaneous diseases manifest in the skin, hands, or feet, their root necessarily lies in the five viscera and six bowels. The blood vessels and meridians of the viscera and bowels circulate throughout the body day and night, completing their cycle without cease. When one viscus is afflicted, the disease must appear where its pulse and qi traverse, corresponding to the yin-yang divisions of the hands and feet. Diseases may be cold or hot: hot ones are easily treated, while cold ones are difficult to cure. Cold necessarily arises from deficiency of original yang in the viscera and bowels, allowing wind evil to exploit the gap and enter. When qi and blood become uneven, the evil travels from the meridians to lodge in the skin, obstructing the smooth flow of the vessels. The more cold congeals, the more it accumulates without dispersing. If incompetent physicians then apply freezing agents, attacking both internally and externally, the condition rarely fails to become critical. The scholar must observe the external signs while examining their internal correspondences; when exterior and interior align, not a single case will be missed.\n\nThis medicine contains *Jun Jiang* and *Rou Gui*, sufficient to warm the blood and generate blood. Yet once generated and warmed, if it cannot disperse, it may instead cause harm. Thus, *Cao Wu* and *Nan Xing* are included to break evil qi, expel wind toxin, enliven dead flesh, relieve bone pain, dissolve lumps, and summon yang qi. *Chi Shao* and *Bai Zhi* further disperse stagnant blood, alleviate suffering, and regenerate flesh. Combined with wine to circulate the medicine’s nature and disperse qi and blood, even the most severe cold patterns will be cured—like kindling flame from cold ashes or reviving spring in withered wood.\n\nGenerally, cold diseases cause yin decay of flesh, rendering it insensate to pain or itching. If pain is present, it often clings to the bone; left untreated, the cold root penetrates the marrow, beyond the reach of ordinary medicines. Only this formula can thoroughly expel yin toxin, restore yang qi, relieve bone pain, and halt diseases of the flesh and skin—this much is evident. However, its use must be measured; excess should be avoided to achieve perfection. Variations in treatment are outlined below.\n\n1. **Yin-type *fabei* (back carbuncle)**, or cases misdiagnosed with cold medicines, or originally yang-type *fabei* mistakenly treated with cold medicines—where yang transforms into yin, the entire back blackens and decays. Apply *Hongbao Dan* around the healthy flesh at the edges to contain the blood, then apply this ointment to the center. After one night, yang qi will return, and blackened areas will turn red. Once redness and vitality are observed, discontinue this medicine and use *Chonghe* to complete the treatment. If ineffective and suppuration begins, add *Nan Xing* and *Cao Wu* to *Chonghe* for use. If yang has returned and blackness has turned red, but a single blackened, decayed spot remains that refuses to redden—this indicates dead blood. Apply *Pu Xiao* (mirabilite) and *Ming Fan* (alum), or alternatively, *Bai Dingxiang* (sparrow droppings), *Peng Sha* (borax), and *Ru Xiang* (frankincense), mixed with saliva. Draw a circle at the junction of black and red, then cover with *Chonghe*. By the next morning, the blackened flesh will detach as if cut away. Wash the area, apply flesh-generating medicine, and close the wound to complete treatment.\n\n2. **Cold *liuzhu* (flowing phlegm)** often clings to the bone, with hardened flesh that does not resolve, cold bone pain, and contracted sinews that cannot extend. Light use of the knife or needle yields no pus or blood—only thin, watery discharge or static blood. Apply this ointment. If slightly delayed, mix equal parts *Jun Jiang*, *Bai Zhi*, *Rou Gui*, and *Cao Wu* with warm wine for application. Once bone cold is dispelled and pain ceases, qi will warm and harmonize, sinews will naturally extend, and hardened flesh will resolve. However, treating *liuzhu* cannot omit *Mu La* (litsea), as its nature excels at breaking stagnant qi and dispersing hard swellings. Yet it must not be used in excess, for it can neutralize the medicine’s nature—this pattern fundamentally relies on warming medicines.\n\n3. **Guzhui wind (drumstick wind)** arises from internal dampness, residual toxin from cold damage, complications of *liuzhu*, or wind-damp vacuity impediment. This condition has three presentations:\n   - The knees knock together when walking, with trembling steps and slight swelling along the knee’s *jinggu* bone.\n   - The junction of the knee’s *jinggu* bone swells to the size of a mallet, the thigh flesh wastes away, and the skin contracts around the bone.\n   - The upper leg swells while the lower leg cools and wastes.\n\n   The feet and knees pertain to the liver. When the liver meridian is invaded by wind, cold, and damp qi, blood and vessels fail to flow, giving rise to this condition. The knees become cold and obstructed, congealing and stagnating. The lower leg’s vessels have outflow but no return, growing ever thinner, colder, and more contracted. The upper leg’s vessels accumulate without dispersion, swelling while the flesh wastes and grows hotter. If originating from *liuzhu*, the flesh may become numb and decay; decay leads to cold toxin corroding the bone. Once the bone rots and emerges, even immortals have no remedy.",
      "overlap_context": "lization in the heart or diaphragm leads to putrefied, pulverized flesh, beyond even the aid of immortals. For this condition in the palm, apply *Hongbao Dan* in a ring around the palm to block the blood, then use *Zhonghe* at the center, leaving an opening to complete the treatment. For the sole, apply *Hongbao* along the foot’s meridian at the *jiaogu* bone, encircling an area one to two *cun* in length, then use *Chonghe* as before to conclude. *Xianchuan Waike Mifang*, Scroll Two, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "Before ulceration occurs and the flesh has not yet necrosed, promptly apply this medicinal paste—mixed with hot wine—to the upper leg at the knee and *jinggu* bone to arrest bone pain and restore yang qi. Then apply *Chonghe* ointment to the cold lower leg to guide the blood and qi, promoting downward flow and unblocking the vessels. Apply this formula again to the junction of the meridian and bone to connect the guided vessels and disperse the accumulated yin qi. Internally, administer *Zhuifeng* pills with double the usual dose of frankincense to relax the sinews, following the prescribed method—none will fail to recover.\n\nIf the patient wishes to go out, one may use *Wuji* powder with added ginger, cinnamon, angelica, and *bai zhi*, further augmented with large Sichuan aconite, *niu xi*, areca nut, and chaenomeles, mixed with tea or wine. For men or women suffering long from cold impediment, blood wind, numbness, or inability to move the limbs, fill a cotton pouch with this medicine and bind it lengthwise around the painful area, securing it with a silk bag. This medicine relieves bone pain; when applied to the flesh, the skin will feel as if ants are crawling—this signals its efficacy. For impediment, add equal parts *ding pi*, evodia fruit, myrrh, and large Sichuan aconite, then combine with *Zhuifeng* pills for simultaneous internal and external treatment—its curative power is divine.\n\nFor unbearable wind-leg pain, take *Zhuifeng* pills internally and apply this formula externally, mixed with raw flour and ginger juice as a hot poultice. For immediate relief, add frankincense and myrrh, dissolving them in wine for application—this is most effective.\n\nFor long-standing injuries penetrating the bone—caused by falls, blows, or fractures where blood was not properly circulated—stagnant blood lingers at the site of injury. Over time, it adheres like chicken lungs to ribs, or in milder cases, like moss clinging to stone. In youth, when blood and qi are warm and harmonious, one may scarcely notice; but in old age, when blood declines, exposure to wind, cold, rain, or dampness triggers the ailment. Apply this formula mixed with hot wine, and internally administer *Sousun Xuntong* pills—combined internal and external treatment is most effective. However, in those with deficient blood and qi, if the illness resides between the chest, ribs, waist, or back, it is called \"unremoved grime,\" which may transform into consumptive blood stasis. Regardless of age or duration—whether affecting the entire body or just a fist or elbow—the treatment is the same. Such conditions are deeply rooted; they cannot be cured with a single dose but require months or years to stabilize. Those not yet consumptive are easily healed; once consumptive, they are difficult.\n\nOne method uses *nan xing* and *cao wu* with a small amount of cinnamon to dispel blackened necrosis and purulent decay—this is called *Xiao Yulong*. For *shi yong* (stone-like carbuncles), apply this formula mixed with hot wine, then encircle the area with *Hongbao* paste to await suppuration and rupture.\n\nFor women with breast abscesses: these often arise after weaning when milk fails to recede; or when milk is abundant but the infant nurses little, causing stagnation and clumping; or when menstruation is irregular and flows counter to its proper course; or when pathogenic qi becomes internally constrained, later forming swollen abscesses. At the initial onset, *do not* use cooling medicines to freeze it. The breast is formed from transformed blood; if it cannot drain, it hardens into swollen lumps. Its nature is inherently cold—if chilled by cold medicines, it congeals and fails to disperse. Over time, external blood unable to transform into milk generates heat and pain, steaming the breast lumps into pus. The suffering is extraordinary, and the abscess will not cease until it rots completely. Thus, those who recover from breast abscesses lose their milk. The breast’s nature is most cold; when further obstructed by cooling agents, yin putrefaction is inevitable. However, cooling medicines are not entirely without use—they are beneficial *after* ulceration. At the initial onset, apply this formula with *nan xing*, mixed evenly with equal parts ginger juice and wine, as a hot poultice to dissolve it internally. For faster results, add *cao wu*—its potent nature can break up malignant masses, expel cold and heat, dissolve when cold, and suppurate when hot. If an abscess has already formed, use *Chonghe* as usual, or add *cao wu* and *nan xing*. After rupture, observe the cause: if from cold, use *Chonghe* to complete the cure; if from heat, use *Hongbao* to generate flesh. Additionally, apply frankincense and myrrh to relieve pain and reduce suffering. For internal medicine, use *Gualou* powder, adjusting for deficiency or excess with *Tongshun* powder or *Shixuan* decoction in alternation.\n\nFor multiple openings, it is called *ru fa* (breast effusion); for hardened breast lumps, *ru shi* (breast stone); for swelling at the nipple, *chui ru* (blown breast); for abscesses below the breast pouch, *ru lou* (breast fistula)—the latter is difficult to treat due to the pendulous flesh where blood readily pools. A single opening is *ru yong* (breast abscess); for those over fifty, there is no treatment. However, *laoren ru jie* (elderly breast nodes) may still be treated, as abscesses form on the pendulous flesh, while nodes appear near the armpit.\n\nFor chronic phlegm deviating from its path, causing swollen abscesses without pus, apply this medicine to induce a response—the illness will discharge laterally, allowing for a better outcome. Otherwise, if original yang is depleted, this becomes a critical condition. For such critical depletion of original yang, urgently apply *Quanti Yulong* to draw out pus, and take *Tongshun* powder with added platycodon, pinellia, tangkuei, and cinnamon. If the illness is red, lively, and rapidly heating, *Danggui Chonghe* is best—*never* mistakenly administer freezing agents. This formula only draws toxins to form pus; discontinue once the illness recedes, and do not overuse. Combining it with *Daomai Shenji* is even more effective, as recorded in *Waike Jingyao*.\n\nFor abdominal abscesses, nine out of ten cases are fatal. The stomach pertains to yin, and external cold envelops internal heat. When qi and blood converge, they seek heat and avoid cold, often forming internal abscesses that cannot manifest externally. Occasionally, a faint shadow may appear, but if touched by cold medicines or cooling agents, even immortals cannot apply their skill—how can physicians not be cautious?",

      "translated_text": "For any case presenting these symptoms, if at the onset there is abdominal pain and, upon pressing with the hand, the pain shifts and moves, this indicates a *qi* mass. If the root remains fixed and there is slight redness and swelling externally, it signifies an internal abscess. Immediately apply this formula to draw out the toxic *qi* and transform it into an external abscess, then complete the treatment with *Chonghe*. Internally, administer *Tongshun* powder with added *rendongteng*, following the method described previously. If the abscess naturally manifests externally, there is no need for this formula—simply use *Chonghe*, and avoid reckless use of needles or blades. Should the abscess be incised with metal instruments, causing the wound to gape, apply *Yulong* to the head of the abscess and encircle the edges with *Chonghe*, allowing it to rupture naturally. If the pus does not drain swiftly, mix three parts *Hongbao* with seven parts ginger juice and tea, then apply to facilitate complete drainage. Internally, use *Shixuan* to nourish and regenerate flesh, while externally, continue with *Chonghe* to conclude the treatment. This condition involves excess yin and deficient yang, inflicting severe harm upon the patient. As recovery nears, double the dosage of internal tonics to restore *qi* and blood, thereby promoting easier healing; otherwise, the abscess may recede only to swell again, and the wound may fail to close. Even after stabilization, it is advisable to take internal tonics with added *fuzi* to prevent *qi* deficiency from impeding recovery.\n\nIn cold-type cases, it is especially important to administer *fuzi* before the abscess ruptures; however, after rupture, avoid hasty astringent or wound-sealing medicines, lest residual toxins remain trapped. With proper medicinal treatment, the wound will close naturally. If the internal abscess has already formed and cannot be drawn outward, apply *Chonghe* externally to warm and promote suppuration, allowing the pus to discharge from the viscera rather than causing internal putrefaction. Life and death hinge entirely on the efficacy of the medicinal treatment—refer to the methods outlined earlier. Most critically, avoid toxic foods, as their consumption will provoke recurrence, making the condition refractory and difficult to cure.\n\nFor pregnant women afflicted with this condition, the approach differs: internally, administer *Zisu* decoction to calm the fetus, and avoid other medicines unless absolutely necessary. If the condition arises near term, the child and pus will descend together; if the pregnancy is still distant, the pus will discharge through the large intestine. If detected early, medicinal treatment alone may resolve it. Should the abscess manifest externally, the condition will necessarily involve heat, and *Chonghe* alone should be used to conclude the treatment—though its application must be carefully weighed against the severity of the case to avoid error.\n\n*Concluding Volume Three of the Immortal’s Transmitted External and Secret Formulas*\n*Beginning Volume Four of the Immortal’s Transmitted External and Secret Formulas*",

      "translated_text": "**Hongbao Elixir (also known as Golden Elixir, Inch of Gold, Four Yellows Powder, One Yellow Powder, Blood-Breaking Elixir, or Yellow Medicine)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- *Tianhuafen* (Trichosanthes root) – 3 *liang*\n- *Jianghuang* (turmeric) – 1 *liang*\n- *Baizhi* (angelica root) – 1 *liang*\n- *Chishaoyao* (red peony root) – 2 *liang*\n\nGrind into a fine powder. Use tea, wine, or water as a vehicle, applying topically for all heat-type abscesses, swellings, and metal-inflicted wounds.\n\nThis medicine is purely cooling. It can transform blood into water yet also cause blood stasis; it cools the flesh and promotes flesh regeneration while removing dead or rotting tissue. It breaks up blood and reduces swelling, yet may also cause qi to stagnate and rise. It can stop pain or induce it, close pus or expel it—its effects are contradictory. The formula’s nature is simple: its efficacy is slight when applied to cold conditions but pronounced when used for heat. Thus, it must not be used lightly for non-severe yang patterns, lest it congeal cold and complicate treatment.\n\nFor metal-inflicted wounds with bleeding, nothing surpasses this remedy—it is the foremost medicine. In other cases, it serves merely as an auxiliary to the two preceding formulas. Discernment is paramount.\n\nGenerally, these three medicines may:\n- Combine forces for a shared effect,\n- Operate independently with specialized authority,\n- Divide duties in coordinated roles,\n- Encircle and attack in concert,\n- Lend mutual reinforcement,\n- Engage in stalwart resistance,\n- Serve as the vanguard with orthodox tactics or achieve victory through unorthodox means,\n- Or lead with unorthodox tactics and secure triumph with orthodox methods.\n\nTheir ingenuity and precision mirror the art of warfare. Yet as troops follow the seal and generals obey commands, success hinges on the practitioner. Without one who understands principles and adapts to change, what can be said of mastery?\n\n**Methods of Application:**\n\n1. For severe heat in the condition, mix with hot tea and apply.\n   For milder heat, use wine as the vehicle.\n   To draw out pus, blend with three parts ginger juice and seven parts tea. Why? This medicine is profoundly cooling and causes blood to recede, while ginger juice, being warm, draws blood forward. Thus, blood retreats and is then propelled, creating a dynamic tension that matures the pus and prompts its discharge.\n\n2. If the wound’s edges harden and fail to resolve, the area has been assailed by wind. Add *duhuo* (angelica pubescens) to this formula and mix with hot wine. If improvement remains elusive, the wind-toxin has penetrated deeply, and the flesh has hardened. Add *zijingpi* (bark of the redbud tree), and resolution is assured.\n\n3. This formula excels at treating metal wounds and heat-type red swellings, staunching the root of bleeding to prevent redness and protrusion. However, it must not be used lightly for carbuncles or deep abscesses, lest the toxin fail to disperse and instead penetrate inward. If it lodges in the bone, it may form a bone abscess; in the throat, it may gather as toxic qi; in the chest or back, it may rot the viscera; in the abdomen, it may become an internal abscess—leading to irreversible harm. One must exercise utmost caution. For such cases, *Chonghe* and *Yulong* should be used according to the method and symptoms.\n\n4. For the young with robust blood or the elderly with debilitated blood, if bleeding cannot be stopped, the patient may perish as blood is exhausted. If the wound is on the limbs, apply the medicine mixed with tea to the area a *chi* above and below the injury. If on the chest, back, waist, or abdomen, cover the entire body to block the blood’s path. Then administer *Duanxue* powder (fivefold the usual dose) or the *Divine Military Formula* (see later) to the wound, and healing will follow.\n\n5. For severe metal wounds where sinews are severed, pulses cut off, and blood lost to the point of death, to staunch bleeding, first bind the arm with a cord or silk sash. Then apply this formula mixed with tea to the arm to block the blood’s path. Next, use the *Duanxue* medicine on the wound. Avoid internal tonics such as *Siwu* decoction, as they may induce vomiting or, in severe cases, cause facial distortion, restlessness, fever, and tetanus. Instead, administer the *Duijin* drink with *Chuanxiong* and *Baizhi*, decocted with ginger and jujube, to stabilize the condition, followed by gradual blood supplementation. If tetanus develops, use tetanus-specific medicines such as *Gegen* decoction (see later). For the wound, apply the *Military Formula* with nine-lobed turtle shell (stir-fried with suet and ground).\n\n6. For metal wounds on the head or face where bleeding does not cease, urgently apply this formula mixed with tea in a circular band around the neck to block the blood. Also apply it to the wound’s edges, and use the *Military Formula* on the wound itself. Severe cases will resolve in ten days; mild ones in three.\n\n7. For metal wounds exposed to water, where the flesh turns white and blooms like a flower, mix this formula with scallion juice and apply to both sides of the wound, then warm gently with fire. Alternatively, fumigate with smoke from early-season rice stalks. If water exudes from the wound, healing will follow. If no water appears, wind has invaded—apply *nanxing* (arisaema) mixed with tea, and the condition will resolve. Then use the *Military Formula* on the wound.\n\n8. For women postpartum or during menopause with reversed blood flow, where the heart cannot govern and blood is vomited, or epistaxis or tongue bleeding occurs, apply this formula mixed with well-water or fresh mugwort juice to the neck. The bleeding will cease immediately, after which internal medicine should be given to address the root. For tongue bleeding, if blood blisters form and refill upon bursting, tie a thread around the base of the tongue (do not remove it). Apply the medicine to the neck to block the blood, and internally administer heart-cooling medicines such as *Huangqin* and *Jingjie*. For the tongue, use honey-mixed wound-sealing medicine. Once the blister is lanced and the thread removed, the bleeding will not recur. Follow with heart-cooling medicines: *Siwu* decoction with *Jingjie*, *Bohe*, and *Zhusha*.\n\n9. When applying this formula to hot toxins, if the area dries and pain persists with redness and swelling, mix with egg white for application. This method is wondrous for stubborn heat toxins.",
      "overlap_context": "rough the large intestine. If detected early, medicinal treatment alone may resolve it. Should the abscess manifest externally, the condition will necessarily involve heat, and *Chonghe* alone should be used to conclude the treatment—though its application must be carefully weighed against the severity of the case to avoid error.\n\n*Concluding Volume Three of the Immortal’s Transmitted External and Secret Formulas*\n*Beginning Volume Four of the Immortal’s Transmitted External and Secret Formulas*",

This is invariably due to cold weather freezing the blood after administering *Dahuang* and similar medicines, causing the blood to congeal and stagnate. In such cases, mix *Junjiang* powder with hot wine and administer it. Within moments, the blood will flow freely, and the patient will revive. This method relies on the heat of the wine to activate stagnant blood, allowing the previous medicines to take effect.\n\n**Formulas to be Used Together, Section Six**\n\n**Huangfan Pill (also called Humo Powder)**\n- *Mingfan* (raw alum), one *liang*, ground to powder\n- Yellow beeswax\n\nMelt the beeswax over a fire, then remove it and allow it to cool to ninety percent.

This is an excellent formula for the poor.\n- Dried *zhamu* leaves, four *liang*\n- Dried lotus leaf hearts and stems\n- *Xuancaogen*\n- *Gancao* nodes\n- *Diyu*, each one *liang*\n\nGrind into a powder. For each dose, take half a *liang*, decoct in two bowls of water until one bowl remains, and divide into two servings. Take one in the morning and one in the evening, then decoct the dregs again.

For each dose, take five *qian*, decoct in one cup of water with three slices of ginger until half remains. Strain through cloth or silk, add a small amount of honey, and administer. Gradually increase to one *liang*, taking three doses per day to ensure smooth urination. If diarrhea occurs, omit *Poxiao* and *Dahuang*. The *Eight-Ingredient Pill* from *Waike Jingyao* also treats this condition.\n\n**Gualou Powder**\nTreats carbuncles and deep-rooted boils.\n- *Gualou* (new or old), stir-fried with Sichuan peppercorns\n- Sichuan peppercorns, twenty grains\n- *Gancao*, three to five *cun*, sliced\n- *Ruxiang*, five grains, the size of *zaojiao* seeds\n\nDecoct in three bowls of weak wine until one bowl remains.

If the sore has not yet formed, it will rupture; if already formed, pus will discharge without manual intervention.\n\n**Haishang Formula**\nTreats internal abscesses with pus, where putrid blood emits a foul stench, leading to cold pain in the navel and abdomen. This is caused by putrid pus, and this formula expels it.\n- *Baizhi*, one *liang*\n- *Baishaoyao*, half a *liang*\n- *Baifan* (calcined), half a *liang*\n- Single-leaf red *shukui* root, two *liang*\n\nGrind into a powder, melt beeswax and alum, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds.

      "translated_text": "**Proven Remedies for All Types of Nail-like Sores**\n\nWhen a nail-like sore (*ding*) first appears, if it does not change color, causes no pain, remains immobile when pressed, has a sunken center, and is accompanied by chills and fever, this confirms the sore. Types include *qi ding*, *water-fire ding*, *snake-eye ding*, *stone ding*, *male-female ding*, *rotten ding*, *blood ding*, *axe ding*, *red-thread*, *fish-eye*, *purple-inkstone*, and *hemp-seed ding*. Immediately apply *Circle Yellow Medicine*: take one gallbladder from a male pig slaughtered in the twelfth lunar month, add realgar, Beijing ink, and ginger juice, grind into powder, and place inside the gallbladder. Apply this medicine around the sore to prevent *walking yellow* (systemic infection).\n\nOnce the *original ding* emerges, insert a needle until pain is felt, then stop. Bleeding is harmless. Apply *Immortal Toad Extract* to draw out toxins, then insert *Yellow Medicine* into the sore and cover with *Water-Sinking Plaster* or *Divine Response Plaster*. When the yellow (pus) recedes, the sore will redden and swell. Around the swollen area, use needles to drain toxic yellow fluid.\n\nIf *walking yellow* occurs, observe where the blood vessels lead and use a fire needle to sever them, halting further spread. If the yellow toxin travels and forms a lump, this confirms the infection. Insert thirty to fifty needles into the lump to drain blood and toxins, then apply *Topical Yellow Medicine* to expel the poison.\n\nIf the yellow toxin crosses from left to right or right to left, the condition is difficult to treat and likely fatal. If no blood emerges when needling the yellow area, or if the blood is dark purple or black, the condition is also critical and fatal.\n\nWhen needling to extract yellow toxin, avoid iron needles—use only gold, silver, or copper needles.\n\nAt the first sign of eruption, urgently administer *Pain-Pursuing Life-Snatching Decoction* to dissolve the swelling internally, yielding immediate results. *Flying Dragon Life-Snatching Elixir* may also be used. Later, administer *Toxin-Transforming Swelling-Resolving Supporting Decoction*. All subsequent medicines should induce profuse sweating for efficacy.\n\n**Method for Extracting Toad Venom (*Chan Su*)**\nTake a live toad with scabies, press its brow ridge onto oil paper or fresh mulberry leaves, and collect the secreted *chan su* with a bamboo strip. Scrape it onto the strip and store in a shaded place overnight until dry, then collect for use.\n\n**Toxin-Pursuing Elixir**\nRemoves the head of the *ding*, draws out pus and toxins, and yields immediate results.\n- *Chan su* (dried), 1 *qian* (dissolve in aged wine)\n- Croton seeds, 7 pieces (remove shells, retain oil)\n- Sparrow droppings (*baidingxiang*), 1 *qian* (if unavailable, add croton seeds)\n- Centipede (wine-soaked, baked until yellow)\n- Sal ammoniac, 1 *qian*\n- Realgar, 2 *qian*\n- Calomel, 1 *qian*\n- Cinnabar, 2 *qian* (for coating; yellow lead may substitute)\n\nGrind all into fine powder, mix with wheat flour and water to form pills. If pills do not hold, add wine and flour paste. Shape into wheat-sized pills with pointed ends. Insert into the needle-opened sore, then cover with *Water-Sinking Plaster*. Later, apply plasters and flesh-generating medicines to expel pus, blood, and toxins.\n\nFor black, sunken, or leaking sores with dead or decayed flesh that impedes healing, this medicine also expels toxins, removes necrotic tissue, and promotes new flesh growth, leading to recovery. Use one pill for small sores; increase for larger ones.\n\nFor mild cases, needles are unnecessary. Scratch the sore’s center with a fingernail, place the medicine, and cover with *Water-Sinking Plaster*. The sore will redden and swell, indicating efficacy. Removing decayed flesh is optimal. This method is divinely effective and yields immediate results.\n\n**Water-Sinking Plaster**\nPlace *bletilla* powder in a dish, add water to submerge it, then cover with paper. When applying this plaster, do not use flesh-generating medicines (formulas provided earlier).\n\n**Topical Yellow Medicine**\n- Cicada slough\n- Silkworm (*jiangcan*)\n\n**Alternative Formulas**\n- Loofah leaves with tendrils, scallion whites, Chinese chives\n- Cocklebur roots and shoots (burned to ash), white salt, plum ash, indigo (most effective)\n\nGrind all into fine powder, mix with vinegar, and apply around the sore, leaving the center open to drain toxins. If the medicine dries, reapply vinegar to keep it moist. If the condition does not improve, add the aforementioned *Toxin-Transforming Blood-Dispersing Toxin-Extracting Powder* for immediate results.\n\nFor *ding* sores with sunken centers or persistent pus, use *iron rust* (quantity as needed), grind into fine powder, mix with vinegar, and apply to the sore. The toxin will naturally protrude, and pus will dry immediately, yielding swift results.\n\n**Pain-Pursuing Life-Snatching Decoction (Secret Formula, Rapid Efficacy)**\nDissolves swelling internally.\n- Notopterygium (*qianghuo*)\n- Pubescent angelica (*duhuo*)\n- Green tangerine peel (use more)\n- Saposhnikovia (*fangfeng*) (use more)\n- Coptis (*huanglian*)\n- Red peony (*chishaoyao*)\n- Asarum (*xixin*)\n- Licorice nodes (*gancaojie*)\n- Cicada slough (*chantui*)\n- Silkworm (*jiangcan*)\n- Coptis rhizome (*jiaolian*) (equal parts)\n\nAdd human placenta (*heche*), *ze lan*, and honeysuckle. For pus, add fleeceflower root (*shouwu*), angelica (*baizhi*) (for smooth flow), *qingmuxiang*, rhubarb (*dahuang*), gardenia (*zhizi*), and morning glory seeds (*qianniu*).\n\nFor leg sores, add chaenomeles (*mugua*).\n\nSlice the ingredients. For each dose of 5 *qian*, first take one dose and add a small amount of *ze lan* leaves, 1 *tael* each of honeysuckle and fresh ginger. Pound together, steep in good wine, and administer warm. For those who do not drink, decoct in water.\n\nThen use 1.5 cups each of wine and water, 10 slices of fresh ginger, and decoct until warm. Administer until sweating occurs. As the condition improves, reduce the dosage, then add 2 *qian* of rhubarb and decoct warm. Finally, induce a bowel movement to expel residual toxins.\n\nThough the ingredients may seem unremarkable, this formula is divinely effective and infallible, with repeated proven results. If other symptoms arise, adjust the treatment accordingly for rapid efficacy.\n\nFor vexation and vomiting, add 1 *qian* of licorice nodes and administer with fermented soybean water.",

For such malignant sores, one dose will bring a head to headless swellings, induce pain in painless ones, and immediately cure those already formed. This is the supreme treasure among remedies for critical conditions—one dose can save a life in peril, with infallible results.

Wrap the pills in the *cong bai* pulp and swallow with 3–4 cups of unadulterated hot wine. Have the patient rest in a wind-free place, covered with clothing. After the time it takes to walk five *li*, administer several more cups of hot wine to reinforce the medicine’s power. The treatment is complete when profuse sweating occurs. For mild cases, two pills will suffice; if no sweat appears, take two more. For severe cases lasting three to five days, take two more pills to cure. If a *ding* sore has spread to the heart (*zou huang*), it is difficult to treat; if cold sweat appears, the patient will die.

      "translated_text": "For the treatment of scrofula (*luǒlì*), regardless of its chronicity, first apply a constrictive bandage to encircle the sore. Then, use moxa fire to cauterize from the lower part upward—once a blister forms, proceed sequentially until reaching the \"mother\" lesion, where the treatment ceases. For each blister, place a slice of garlic and apply five to seven cones of moxa. After cauterizing each lesion, immediately apply a medicated plaster, changing it daily for immediate efficacy.\n\n**Secret-Transmitted Medicated Plaster**\n- *Zhen lǜ fěn* (true chlorite schist): 2.5 *liǎng*, stir-fried in a copper pan until yellow and desiccated\n- *Rǔ xiāng* (frankincense): 0.5 *liǎng*\n- *Tán xiāng* (sandalwood): 0.5 *liǎng*, baked dry\n- *Xiāng jié* (or *xiāng jié*, dragon’s blood resin): 0.5 *liǎng*\n- *Mò yào* (myrrh): 0.5 *liǎng* (used for pain)\n- *Dǎn fán* (true chalcanthite): 0.5 *liǎng* (discontinue after toxin extraction and tissue regeneration)\n- *Qīng fěn* (calomel): a small amount\n- *Nán shé dǎn* (cobra gall, optional)\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk, usable if broken): omit initially\n\nGrind each into fine powder. For every 0.5 *liǎng* of the above ingredients, use 5 *liǎng* of mung bean powder, mixing with rice vinegar to form a paste. Spread on oil paper and apply. If tissue fails to regenerate, add tissue-regenerating agents to achieve healing.\n\n**Five Fragrances Forsythia Powder**\nTreats all accumulations of heat, scrofula with nodules, abscesses, malignant sores, and boils.\n- *Chén xiāng* (aloeswood)\n- *Lián qiào* (forsythia, stems removed)\n- *Rǔ xiāng* (frankincense)\n- *Shēng má* (black cohosh)\n- *Dà huáng* (rhubarb, steamed for purgation or used raw)\n- *Sāng jì shēng* (mistletoe, or substitute *shēng má*)\n- *Dīng xiāng* (clove, twigs removed)\n- *Shè gān* (belamcanda)\n- *Dú huó* (angelica)\n- *Mù tōng* (akebia)\n- *Qiāng huó* (notopterygium)\n- *Gān cǎo* (licorice)\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk, usable if broken)\n- *Qīng mù xiāng* (costusroot), equal portions\n\nChop the ingredients. For each dose, use 4 *qián* with 2 cups of water, decocting to 80% volume. Take warm after meals until malignant toxins are purged. An alternate formula adds raw *huáng qí* (astragalus).\n\nThis decoction may include bamboo sap and *máng xiāo* (mirabilite), adjusting quantities based on heat severity for optimal efficacy. Use the dregs to prepare a wash for immediate healing of sores.\n\n**Instant-Efficacy Powder for Scrofula** (also called Six-One Powder or Beneficial Origin Powder)\nFor early-stage scrofula, this remedy brings immediate relief.\n- *Huá shí* (talc): 1 *liǎng*\n- *Gān cǎo* (licorice): 2 *qián*\n\nFirst, take 1.5 *qián* of the powder per dose, mixed with rice water. Administer one dose before sleep and another at midnight.\n\n**Alternate Formula**\n- *Jīng jiè suì* (schizonepeta spikes): 4 *qián*\n- *Jiāng cán* (silkworm): 4 *qián*\n- *Hēi qiān niú* (black cowherb): 4 *qián*\n- *Bān máo* (blister beetles): 28, heads, legs, and wings removed, stir-fried with glutinous rice until golden (discard beetles, retain rice)\n\nGrind all into fine powder. Take 1 *qián* per dose at dawn with warm wine, expelling malignant toxins via urine. If no toxins appear, take another dose the next day; if still ineffective, on the third day at dawn, first consume thin glutinous rice porridge, then take another dose, followed by 1 *qián* of *hǔ pò* (amber) powder mixed with rush pith decoction. Success is marked by the expulsion of toxins in urine, ensuring no recurrence. For unrelenting abdominal pain or excessive toxin discharge, consume cold tea. If pain persists, grind *fáng fēng* (saposhnikovia) in water to relieve it. Do not overuse the preceding remedies.\n\n**Arctium Pill**\nTreats wind-toxin nodules, persistent scrofula, and unrelenting swelling and pain.\n- *Niú bàng zǐ* (arctium): 1 *liǎng*, lightly stir-fried\n- *Hé shǒu wū* (fleeceflower root): 1 *liǎng*\n- *Gān bò hé* (dried mint): 2 *liǎng*\n- *Xióng huáng* (realgar): 2 *liǎng*\n- *Niú huáng* (cow bezoar): 2 *qián*\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk): 2 *qián*\n- *Zào jiǎo* (honey locust bark): 7 pieces, pounded in 2 *shēng* of water, decocted into a paste\n\nGrind the above into powder, mixing with the honey locust paste to form pills the size of *wú tóng* seeds.

Take 2 *qián* per dose with rice water.\n\n**Proven Remedies for Throat Conditions**\nThe throat serves as the body’s vital passage, connecting to the stomach and facilitating breath. If heat toxins accumulate in the chest and diaphragm, generating wind-phlegm that stagnates and fails to disperse, it manifests as throat diseases—sores within the throat, resembling rotting flesh, causing swelling, pain, obstruction, and difficulty swallowing. Severe cases may produce a \"double tongue.\" Treatment should first dispel wind-phlegm to unblock the throat, then resolve heat toxins; delay risks irrecoverable consequences. Heat toxins attacking the upper palate may cause sores called \"suspended abscesses,\" while visceral cold can also impair swallowing. Carefully examine symptoms to apply appropriate treatments.\n\n**Toxin-Transforming Supportive Powder**\nTreats acute throat closure due to wind-heat attack, swollen and painful cheeks, as well as double and single *é* (tonsillitis), *jié hóu* (throat constriction), *chóng shé* (double tongue), and *mù shé* (wooden tongue), providing relief upon purgation.\n- *Xuán shēn* (figwort)\n- *Mù tōng* (akebia)\n- *Dà huáng* (rhubarb, raw)\n- *Dàn zhú yè* (bland bamboo leaf)\n- *Shān zhī zǐ* (gardenia)\n- *Shēng dì huáng* (raw rehmannia)\n- *Dēng cǎo* (rush pith)\n\nChop the ingredients, decoct in water, and take warm.\n\n**Emergency Gargle for Choking**\nMix *zào jiǎo* (honey locust) powder with water and sesame oil, or swallow *bǎi cǎo shuāng* (soot) for immediate relief.\n\n**Mountain Bean Root Decoction**\nTreats swollen, closed, and painful throat, gargled to expel phlegm. Holding the decoction in the mouth and swallowing brings immediate healing.\n- *Shān dòu gēn* (mountain bean root, detoxifying)\n- *Líng xiāo gēn* (trumpet creeper root, tissue-regenerating)\n- *Shān zhī zǐ* (gardenia)\n- *Dàn zhú yè* (bland bamboo leaf)\n- *Ài yè* (mugwort)\n- *Dēng cǎo* (rush pith)\n\nChop the ingredients. For drinkers, decoct with wine; for non-drinkers, use water. Pregnant women should avoid this remedy. Consuming five to six doses after throat sores heal prevents recurrence.\n\n**Throat-Blowing Wind-Dispelling Powder**\nTreats throat sores, swelling, and pain; *chán hóu fēng* (throat-constricting wind), single and double *é* (tonsillitis), *jié hóu* (throat constriction), acute throat wind, *fēi sī rù hóu* (ingested flying filaments), *chóng shé* (double tongue), and *mù shé* (wooden tongue).",

Apply a small amount by blowing into the throat—if the sore has not yet formed, it will disperse swiftly; if already formed, it will rupture immediately, yielding instant healing. For severe cases, blow the powder into the nostrils. If phlegm is copious, urgently prepare a solution by grinding fresh mugwort leaves with rice vinegar, then hold in the mouth and rinse to expel phlegm, achieving immediate healing.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\nTake a pig’s gallbladder from the twelfth lunar month, fill it with *míng fán* (alum) powder, and hang it in the wind to dry. Remove the alum, grind it into powder, and blow it into the throat for instant efficacy. For those who suffer annual recurrences, moxibustion can prevent future outbreaks.\n\n**For Lockjaw**\nUse *jiǔ lóng chuān* (also called *jīn chāi cǎo*, \"golden hairpin herb\"), preferably a single-stemmed specimen. Peel the root, crush it, wrap in silk, and bind it to the end of a chopstick. Apply to the teeth five or six times to open the jaw, then apply similarly to the throat to expel phlegm and drool. Later, roast the herb, grind it into powder, and wrap it in silk with the powder to apply to the throat five or six times for healing. If symptoms recur after eating, crush fresh ginger, roast *zào jiǎo* (soap bean) until charred, and grind into powder. Wrap the ginger with salt and the powdered soap bean in silk, and apply to the throat five or six times for healing.\n\n**For Acute Throat-Constricting Wind**\nGrind fresh ginger with rice vinegar and administer as a rinse—throat sores will rupture immediately, yielding marvelous results.\n\n**Drumstick Herb and Local Ox-Knee**\nAdd *wū yào* (lindera root) for enhanced efficacy. Grind the two fresh herbs together, extract the juice, and administer with vinegar. For severe cases, pour into the nostrils to induce phlegm expulsion and healing. If using dried herbs, grind into powder and decoct with rice vinegar.\n\n**Divine Powder**\nTreats acute seasonal *chán hóu fēng* (throat-constricting wind) with progressive throat obstruction, inability to swallow food or water, lockjaw, and loss of consciousness.\n- *Xióng huáng* (realgar)\n- *Huá lú shēng* (raw veratrum)\n- *Bái fán* (alum)\n- *Yá zào* (soap bean, skin removed and roasted yellow)\n- Add *jié xiāo* (mantis egg-case, seven pieces)\n\nGrind all into a fine powder. Administer a \"one-character\" dose by blowing into the nostrils to induce the expulsion of stubborn phlegm for healing.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\nDecoct *bái yào* (white medicine) and *shān dòu gēn* (mountain bean root) together, hold in the mouth to rinse and expel phlegm, then swallow one or two mouthfuls.\n\n**Proven Remedy for Rabid Dog Bites**\nIf bitten by a rabid dog, immediately consume half a cup of pure oil to clear the heart. Urgently prepare *xióng huáng* (realgar) and stir-fried *bān máo* (blister beetle, with head, wings, and legs removed), grinding them into fine powder. Take one dose daily. Additionally, mix *xióng huáng* with wine and consume forty-nine doses over forty-nine days. Cold water with a small amount of pure oil may also be used, with the expulsion of foul toxins via urine as the benchmark. If urine does not flow, take an additional dose. After urination, if abdominal pain occurs, urgently mix *qīng diàn* (indigo) with cold water and consume to relieve symptoms; a decoction of *huáng lián* (coptis) may also be used. After taking the medicine, avoid consuming hot foods to ensure complete healing. Do not wait for the wound to heal—if it does not rupture, apply moxibustion to break it and release the toxic qi to prevent recurrence. If blood appears in the urine, the condition is incurable and will prove fatal. If the victim dies shortly after being bitten, urgently treat them. If symptoms appear within a year or a hundred days, and the victim is dead but the heart remains warm, they can still be saved. Urgently decoct one *jīn* (catty) of *huái huā* (pagoda tree flower) with two large bowls of water and wine, reducing it to one and a half bowls. Warm the decoction and use an implement to pry open the mouth, pouring it into the throat. After a short while, the victim will revive. One hour later, feed them warm, clear congee, and they will recover. If not, administer the dregs of the decoction. Avoid cold water and wind-inducing foods like mutton—strictly observe these prohibitions.\n\n**Another Proven Formula**\nFor recurrent cases with no other remedy, this method is highly effective.\n- *Míng xióng huáng* (clear realgar), five *qián* (mace)\n- *Shè xiāng* (musk), five *qián*\n\nGrind each into fine powder and mix evenly. Dissolve in two cups of wine and administer. If the patient refuses, pinch their nose and pour it down. After taking the medicine, the patient will inevitably sleep—do not disturb them. Allow them to sleep until they naturally revive, then administer the previous medicine again upon the expulsion of foul matter to achieve healing.\n\n**Another Proven Remedy**\nGrind *xìng rén* (apricot kernel, skin and tips removed) with *mǎ lán gēn* (horse orchid root) into a fine paste. First, wash the wound with a decoction of scallions, then apply the paste. Alternatively, use *xìng rén* alone (skin and tips removed).\n\n**Another Formula**\nUse fifty *bì má zǐ* (castor beans), remove the shells, and grind into a paste with well water. First, wash the wound with lye water, then apply the paste.\n\n**Another Formula**\nApply *hǔ gǔ yóu* (tiger bone oil) for instant efficacy.\n\n*Immortal-Transmitted External Medicine Secret Formulas, Scroll Seven*\n*Immortal-Transmitted External Medicine Secret Formulas, Scroll Eight*\n*Compiled by Zhao Yizhen of Junyi, the Original Yang Master*",

      "translated_text": "**On Various Abscess and Sore Formulas**\n\nThe physician’s use of medicine is like a general’s use of troops. As the saying goes: \"A thousand soldiers are easily found, but a single good general is hard to seek.\" Victory is decided by a skilled general; efficacy is decided by a skilled physician. Knowing whether troops will triumph or fall lies in the general’s command; knowing whether a patient will live or die lies in the physician’s diagnosis. Though an army may be vast, without a skilled general, the troops cannot prevail. Though a thousand formulas exist, without a skilled physician, the medicines cannot take effect. For a skilled general must have troops to command, just as a skilled physician must have medicines to prescribe. The general’s might lies in deploying unconventional tactics to defeat the enemy; the physician’s merit lies in using extraordinary remedies to cure illness. In warfare and medicine alike, one must first seek out skilled generals and physicians—without the right person, neither troops nor medicines can succeed. To preserve one’s health and avoid illness, one must follow the wise counsel of a skilled physician.\n\n*The Sagely Benefit Formulas* states: The *Neijing* asks, how does one distinguish between abscesses and sores? When the five viscera are disharmonious, abscesses arise. Those with long-standing wasting-thirst disorders often develop abscesses and sores. Immoderate eating and drinking, erratic joy and anger, insufficient yin qi, and excess yang qi disrupt the harmony of the constructive and defensive energies, causing blood to stagnate and fail to circulate. When blood stagnates, defensive qi cannot flow, and heat accumulates, giving rise to abscesses and sores, which generate intense heat. In severe cases, the flesh putrefies into pus, yet the condition does not penetrate the muscles and skin to the bones and marrow, nor does it scorch the marrow or damage the five viscera. However, if the muscles, skin, bones, and marrow become scorched, extending inward to the five viscera, and the blood and qi are exhausted, the disease may erode the sinews and bones, leaving no healthy flesh. Abscesses and sores may arise internally or externally: internally, they form between the chest, abdomen, and viscera; externally, they manifest on the surface of the skin, flesh, muscles, and bones. Though these two poisons arise without fixed locations, they bear consistent names.\n\nThe root of abscesses lies in stagnant blood that fails to induce sweating, internal stasis that does not shed impurities, and pent-up qi that cannot disperse outward, accumulating into heat. The formation of abscesses and sores with pus and fluid is neither heaven-sent nor earth-born—it is the result of accumulation. To safeguard life, one must exhaust all medical means to prevent harm, guard against incipient signs, and address disorders before they take shape—this is the principle of \"treating in the evening what is perceived in the morning.\" Yet illnesses arise in myriad forms, with varied triggers: as sores, boils, clove sores, abscesses, or deep-rooted sores. Though their initial signs may differ slightly, one must regard them with grave concern. Many dismiss them lightly, leading to countless deaths.\n\nWhen abscesses and sores first appear, their symptoms are subtle, and most people do not take them seriously—they should be treated promptly. Heat emerging between the skin layers causes superficial swelling with small roots, growing no larger than one or two *cun*—this is an abscess. When heat from the great fu-organs surges outward, it erupts violently, producing glossy, soft swelling that spreads widely—this is an abscess or deep-rooted sore. Some cases are deficient, others excessive: deficient conditions require supplementation; excessive conditions require drainage. Those with excess heat are easier to cure; those with deficient cold and pathogenic heat are harder to treat. Swelling that is firm and yields thick pus is excessive; swelling that is soft and yields thin pus is deficient. Most treatments lack method and order, and in the moment of urgency, how can one discern the depth of the illness? This is why so many perish.\n\nTreating abscesses and sores is like addressing a sudden collapse—where there is injury, there is suffering. Yet abscesses and sores demand urgent care. Those arising on the throat, tongue, face, brain, nape, shoulders, upper back, chest, diaphragm, or breasts—if located in perilous areas—are critical. They must be treated the same day they are detected, and recovery may still be possible. Without a skilled physician, or if one fails to grasp the analogy, even if a common doctor achieves a cure, it is mere luck. Most people do not regard these conditions as urgent, yet they truly require immediate treatment. Delay risks irreversible progression, and such cases often end in fatality. Treating these illnesses is like extinguishing a fire, rescuing the drowning, or pursuing fleeing bandits—delay invites disaster.\n\nAbscesses and sores manifest in three types: swelling that is elevated and soft arises from the blood vessels; swelling that is sunken and firm arises from the bones and flesh; swelling with unchanged skin color arises from the bone marrow. Shallow sores favor thin areas; deep sores favor thick areas. In abscesses and sores, pressing firmly elicits pain if the pus is deep; light pressure causes pain if the pus is shallow. If the pressed area does not rebound, there is no pus—it is water. If it rebounds, pus is present. Swelling that is entirely soft is a blood tumor, not an abscess. Swelling that gradually enlarges without excessive heat, with intermittent pulling pain, is a qi tumor. These are caused by knotted accumulations that do not dissipate over time, eventually developing into abscesses, deep-rooted sores, or clove sores—all due to cold qi. When cold lingers and accumulates, extreme yin generates yang, transforming cold into heat, leading to ulceration. Such ulcers invariably become fistulas.\n\nYet illnesses have shifting symptoms, and diseases wax and wane. To comprehend them fully requires more than fleeting insight—medicine is an art of intention, adapting to the moment’s demands.\n\n*The Sagely Benefit* states: Abscesses, deep-rooted sores, clove sores, breast abscesses, and boils exhibit the five favorable and seven adverse signs—these must not be overlooked. Restlessness with coughing, or abdominal pain with thirst, progressing to uncontrolled diarrhea, or urination resembling strangury—this is the first adverse sign. Copious pus and blood, severe swelling and inflammation, foul pus, and unrelenting pain—this is the second adverse sign. Labored breathing, shortness of breath, disorientation, and lethargy—this is the third adverse sign.",

How could such subtleties be grasped by ordinary minds? If all five favorable signs converge, the condition is most auspicious. If all seven adverse signs manifest together, the crisis is severe.\n\nHerein are recorded the diagnostic signs, supplemented with acupoint observations for clarity. If pain arises subtly in the region of *mó* over the viscera, it is *fèi jū* (lung flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *fèi yōng* (lung abscess). If dull pain arises at *Jùquè*, it is *xīn jū* (heart flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *xīn yōng* (heart abscess). If dull pain arises at *Qīmén*, it is *gān jū* (liver flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *gān yōng* (liver abscess). If dull pain arises at *Zhāngmén*, it is *pí jū* (spleen flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *pí yōng* (spleen abscess). If dull pain arises at *Zhōngwǎn*, it is *wèi jū* (stomach flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *wèi yōng* (stomach abscess). If dull pain arises at *Jīngmén*, it is *shèn jū* (kidney flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *shèn yōng* (kidney abscess). If dull pain arises at *Tiānshū*, it is *dà cháng jū* (large intestine flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *dà cháng yōng* (large intestine abscess). If dull pain arises at *Dāntián*, it is *sān jiāo jū* (triple burner flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *sān jiāo yōng* (triple burner abscess). If dull pain arises at *Guānyuán*, it is *xiǎo cháng jū* (small intestine flat-abscess); if slight swelling appears above, it is *xiǎo cháng yōng* (small intestine abscess). Examine the affected *mó* in the patient and, based on these signs, determine the depth of the abscess or flat-abscess. Identify which organ the disease originates from, what mineral or stone medicines the patient has previously consumed, assess the strength or weakness of their qi, and treat accordingly after careful consideration.\n\n*The Thousand Gold Pieces* states: Whenever an abscess or flat-abscess first appears—whether a large boil, small boil, large abscess, or small abscess—observe it closely. At the slightest abnormality, act with urgency and treat it immediately. Cease all consumption of toxic substances to allow healthy flesh to regenerate swiftly, and abstain from sexual activity for three months. Guard against cold winds and overexertion until the sinews, blood, and vessels fully recover; only then may one act freely. If precautions are not strictly observed, new flesh may be easily damaged, and severe injury may lead to further ulceration. If the condition recurs, disaster will follow—be vigilant, be vigilant.\n\nFor all abscesses and flat-abscesses at onset, administer *Zhuīdīng Duómìng Tāng* promptly to resolve internally, or use *Huàdú Xiāozhǒng Tuōguǒ Sǎn*, *Mìchuán Nèituō Qiānjīn Sǎn*, or *Shíliù Wèi Liúqì Yǐn*. For those with pronounced yin patterns, use *Nèihán Sǎn*. During treatment, apply *Jiědú Shēngjī Sǎn* topically, along with *Huàdú Sǎn* and *Xuè Bá dú Sǎn*. After applying *Huàdú Shēngjī* ointment, use an iron tube with *Bádu Gāo* to draw out toxins. For all such eruptions, if the condition does not stabilize, apply the treatment in a ring around the lesion until the skin breaks, at which point it will cease. At the initial stage, this will cause dispersal. If pus is present, use this method to rupture the lesion and drain the pus. If drainage is incomplete, use a medicinally boiled suction tube to extract the pus, toxic fluids, and blood, and recovery will follow.\n\nSwelling with a root spanning one to three *cùn* is a boil; two to five *cùn* is an abscess; five *cùn* to one *chǐ* is a flat-abscess; one to three *chǐ* is termed \"whole-body.\" Lesions the size of a bean are called *páozi*. When a flat-abscess forms pus and drains from all nine orifices, and once the pus is fully expelled, use tweezers to remove necrotic flesh until the root of the pus is eliminated, then apply flesh-generating and pain-relieving medicine. Once the flesh is replenished, use a paper-shielded medicinal plaster.\n\nIt is further stated: When qi stagnates in the channels and collaterals, causing both blood and qi to congeal and fail to circulate, abscesses and flat-abscesses form. Though not initially attributed to heat, the subsequent development of abscesses arises from yang qi converging, where cold transforms into heat. When heat prevails, flesh putrefies into pus. This occurs when the body harbors heat, which is then constrained by cold, causing the vessels to congeal and stagnate, leading to the formation of abscesses and flat-abscesses.\n\nDeep pressure eliciting pain indicates a deep-seated condition; light pressure eliciting pain indicates a shallow condition. If the pressed area does not rebound, there is no pus; if it rebounds, pus is present. If it does not rebound, the condition may still resolve. If pressing causes overall tension, pus has not yet formed. If the area is partially soft upon pressing, pus is present. If the area feels cool to the touch, there is no pus; if it is markedly hot, pus is present. Upon detecting pus, it should be drained immediately. If there is only qi-induced swelling without pus but with blood, exercise extreme caution—do not lance it. Instead, apply *Qiānjīn Bádu Gāo* to contain it.\n\nIf the periphery is firm but the center is soft, pus is certainly present; if one side is soft, pus may also be present. If the entire area is firm, it is a malignant nodule, possibly due to qi stagnation. If the entire area is soft, it is a blood mass—a blood tumor. Carefully assess firmness, softness, deficiency, and excess, as these are critical.\n\nFor long-standing firm flat-abscesses that later develop heat and localized softening, the softened area must not be lanced. For soft flat-abscesses, keep the patient warmly clothed and covered—if lanced or needled, they cannot be cured. For abscesses with pus, do not hesitate due to thick skin; drain them promptly. In cases of bone abscesses, where the skin color remains unchanged, administer *Huàdú Xiāozhǒng Tuōguǒ Sǎn* and *Zǒumǎ Sǎn* urgently, and apply *Huàdú Bádu Sǎn* topically to draw out toxins and remove stagnant blood. If no pus forms, the condition will resolve.",

If pus is to be drained, do not pierce directly at the apex; instead, incise from the lower edge to ensure proper drainage. Once the pus is fully expelled, new flesh will grow. Apply a flesh-generating topical powder, followed by a medicated plaster, and healing will follow.\n\nIt is further stated: When an abscess arises on the neck, it is called *yāo jū* (\"heavenly carbuncle\"). Its appearance is large, red, and black. If not treated promptly, the heat-qi will descend into the *yuān yè* region, damaging the *Rèn mài* (Conception Vessel), and internally scorching the liver and lungs, leading to death within ten days. As the classics say: \"The front of the neck is called the *xiàng*.\"\n\nAccording to the *Wèijì Bǎoshū* (\"Treasured Book of Guarding and Saving\"): One *cùn* and three *fēn* behind the ear lies the \"gate of life\"; an abscess here is fatal, and thus *ruì dú* (\"sharp toxin\") is incurable. *Ruì dú* refers to the virulence of the toxin, also called *fā yí* (\"swollen jaw\"). When heat-qi steams upward, affecting the forehead and mouth, it may pierce the throat, causing instant death.\n\nWhen a *nǎo jū* (\"brain carbuncle\") develops, heat-qi attacks the brain, emerging through the skin as a head lesion. Initially, it resembles a millet grain, with redness, swelling, and hardness spreading to the ears and neck, accompanied by chills, fever, and pain. If not treated urgently, the toxin will penetrate the flesh and blood, causing putrefaction and the discharge of pus and fluid from the head. As the blood and qi are internally depleted, death is inevitable.\n\nThe *Wàitái* (\"Outer Platform\") states: Any abscess arising in the throat is called *měng jū* (\"fierce carbuncle\"). If not treated promptly, blood will turn to pus, and if not drained, it will obstruct the throat, leading to death. If blood transforms into pus within half a day and the pus is not expelled, the patient will be unable to eat and will perish in three days. Another text says: Without food, *yáng* qi surges violently, consuming the brain and scorching the carbuncle, and the complexion will be joyless. Alternatively, if there is neck pain as if pierced by a needle, with heart vexation, death is certain, and it cannot be treated. One must also assess the deficiency or excess of qi and deliberate carefully in treatment.\n\nIt is further stated: When an abscess arises on the chest, it is called *jǐng jū* (\"well carbuncle\"). It resembles a soybean in size and will develop over three to four days. If not treated early, it will descend into the abdomen, and if it enters the abdomen without treatment, death will occur in ten days. Persistent chills and fever also lead to death.\n\nIt is also said: When an abscess arises on a toe, it is called *tuō jū* (\"shedding carbuncle\"). If it appears red and black without fluid, it is fatal and untreatable. If it is not red and black but contains fluid, it may be treated. If treatment fails to improve the condition, the toe must be promptly amputated to save the patient’s life; otherwise, death will follow.\n\nThe *Shènghuì* (\"Sagely Benefit\") states: If pus and fluid continue to discharge from a wound and the wound opening closes prematurely, though it may appear healed, the wind-toxin remains unresolved. When foul fluid recurs and discharges rapidly, it will transform into a fistula. This warning must be heeded and guarded against carefully.

      "translated_text": "**On the Forms and Symptoms of Back Abscesses**\n\n**Abscess of the Back**\nAn abscess arising on the back may span a foot in width and penetrate a foot in depth. If it ulcerates to the bone but does not breach the membrane, the patient will not die. This condition stems from consuming contaminated food, whereby the toxin lodges between the spleen and abdomen. Urgent treatment must target the poison in the spleen and abdomen, attacking it both internally and externally. As the spleen readily putrefies, swift administration of medicine is essential. At onset, employ *Decoction for Pursuing the Nail and Seizing Life* to achieve internal resolution (the formula appears at the end). Use *Powder for Transforming Toxin, Dispersing Swelling, and Supporting the Interior* and *Powder for Internal Support Worth a Thousand Gold* to consolidate. During the intermediate stage, apply *Medicine for Resolving Toxin, Generating Flesh, and Alleviating Pain* to the center, and *Powder for Drawing Out Toxin* around the periphery. Conclude with *Ointment for Generating Flesh* to ensure efficacy.\n\n**Lotus-Seed Abscess**\nThis abscess arises on the right, where the toxin from the spleen may surge toward the heart. Given the intensity of heart fire, oral medicine must be used to disperse it, while topical applications intercept the toxin to prevent it from attacking the heart. If the entire back swells, it is incurable; only if the swelling subsides can it be treated.\n\nAll sores—whether painful or itchy—originate in the heart, for the heart governs the blood and circulates qi. For migratory painful sores, apply *Powder with Supreme Monarch* and administer fire needling three or four times at the site for optimal effect. Use the aforementioned *Powder for Transforming Toxin, Dispersing Swelling, and Supporting the Interior*, adding *arisaema*, *wild aconite*, *momordica*, *fritillaria*, *garlic*, and *fresh ginger*, mixed with rice vinegar. Apply while leaving an opening, and within two or three days, the swelling will fully resolve. Keep the area moistened with vinegar.\n\n**Honeycomb Abscess**\nThis abscess, with its head at the top, is most difficult to treat and constitutes a counterflow pattern. Careful medication is required, for it is called *Honeycomb Abscess*. Treatment relies on oral medicine to support the interior, generate flesh, alleviate pain, and disperse blood, lest the toxin attack the heart and penetrate the membrane, rendering it nearly incurable due to lingering heart fire.\n\n**Migratory Scrofula Abscess**\nCommonly misattributed to the \"turtle’s shadow\" in folk sayings, medical texts contain no such reference. The notion that a turtle’s offspring causes this on the back is unfounded; rather, the toxin rides wind-heat to migrate. This condition arises from excessive wind generating extreme heat, which in turn causes qi to scatter. Urgent dispersal of wind and settling of heat will naturally calm the qi. The medicine for this is akin to deploying troops to quell disorder. If the toxin flows to the hands, feet, or legs, death is certain.\n\n**Abscess of the Kidney Transport**\nThis condition results from dampness, pent-up anger, and consumption of hot liquor, injuring the internal kidneys and causing toxin to flow to the kidney transport points. Swift application of both oral and topical medicines is required to resolve the toxin within the kidneys, employing flesh-generating remedies in a dual internal-external assault. If the abscess arises in the yin aspect and damages the kidney membrane, it becomes difficult to treat. Strictly avoid anger and sexual activity; even minor transgressions will render it incurable. Exercise utmost caution.\n\n**Dual Abscess of the Kidney Transport and Spleen Abscess**\nThis condition manifests as dual abscesses below the kidney transport points, caused by consuming hot liquor, engaging in sexual activity, harboring anger, or contracting dampness. If it arises in the yang aspect externally, it is treatable. However, if phlegm or yin abscesses damage the kidney membrane, resulting in thin pus, this indicates deficiency and is nearly incurable, inevitably fatal.\n\nA spleen abscess arising between the left shoulder blades may be treated at onset by pricking with a lamp wick and inducing sweating with *Decoction for Pursuing the Nail*, which will disperse it.\n\n**Right Shoulder Abscess**\nThis abscess arises on the right shoulder bone. Though treatable, it is difficult to stabilize due to movement. If it spreads to the left shoulder, it becomes nearly incurable. Apply medicinal powders as directed in the *Left Shoulder Abscess* formula.\n\n**Left Shoulder Abscess**\nThis abscess arises on the left shoulder bone. Though treatable, it is difficult to stabilize due to movement. If it spreads to the right shoulder, it becomes nearly incurable. Use chicken yolk membrane or silk floss, baked dry and ground into powder. Apply dry if the area is moist, or mix with clear oil for application if dry.\n\n**Abscess Opposite the Heart**\nThis abscess arises directly opposite the heart due to exuberant heart fire and the convergence of heat qi in this region. The toxin grows increasingly virulent and migratory. Urgent use of medicine to course and discharge heart fire is required, followed by flesh-generating remedies to achieve resolution.\n\n**Honeycomb Abscess of the Chest**\nThis honeycomb abscess arises between the chest and breast due to exuberant heart fire. Treatment relies on the aforementioned medicine for coursing heart fire. Any delay risks the heat attacking the heart, resulting in certain death.\n\n**Honeycomb Abscess of the Occiput**\nThis abscess arises at the back of the head in a honeycomb pattern. Urgent treatment is required. If it presents with redness, swelling, and pain, it is easily cured; if phlegm is involved, it becomes nearly incurable. Prompt oral and topical treatment is essential. Should it spread to both shoulders, it is absolutely incurable.\n\n**Two-Headed Back Abscess**\nIf this abscess has two small heads with toxin spreading outward, it arises from dietary factors, where qi and food interact and combine due to deficiency. Qi deficiency causes dispersion, widening the opening. Urgent administration of medicine for internal resolution is required, along with yang supplementation.\n\n**Abscesses and Flat Abscesses of the Flanks**\nThese abscesses and flat abscesses form beneath the flanks due to deficiency and qi vacuity. Under no circumstances should yang-supplementing medicine be administered. Since they arise from vacuity, hot formulas must be avoided; if heat is introduced, vacuity will worsen, and the heat will readily damage the bone membrane. Exercise utmost caution.\n\n**Abscesses at the Hairline**\nThese abscesses arise at the hairline on either side of the nape. Urgent topical treatment is required. If they present as kernels, the root must be promptly excised. If they resemble brain-heart abscesses, heat qi ascends to attack the brain, causing redness, swelling, hardness, and pain around the ears and neck, accompanied by chills and fever. Without swift treatment, the toxin will enter the blood, causing flesh to rot and pus to form. If blood and qi emerge from the head, or if phlegm is involved, it is nearly incurable and fatal.\n\n**Occipital Abscess**\nThis condition, called *Heavenly Flat Abscess*, presents as large and purplish-black. Without urgent treatment, heat will penetrate the armpit, injure the Conception Vessel, and internally scorch the liver and lungs, leading to death within ten days.",

      "translated_text": "Apply the previously mentioned *Dissolve Toxin and Reduce Swelling Supportive Powder* and *Internal Support Thousand Gold Powder*, along with *Promote Flesh Growth and Relieve Pain* remedies to achieve efficacy.\n\n**Postauricular Abscess**\nThis condition arises one *cun* and three *fen* behind the ear—a fatal location. If it develops, it is invariably fatal, hence termed *Acute Toxin* and left untreated. *Acute Toxin* presents as firm and sharply toxic, called *Mandibular Swelling*. When heat steams upward, connecting to the jaw and penetrating the mouth, it inevitably leads to throat perforation and death.\n\nPrescribed remedies follow.\n\n**Break Binding Powder**\nSpecifically treats *stone goiter*, *qi goiter*, *sinew goiter*, *blood goiter*, and similar conditions. Administer this remedy promptly, along with subsequent topical applications.\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Sargassum* (washed) – 3 *qian*\n- *Gentiana* – 3 *qian*\n- *Clam shell* – 3 *qian*\n- *Rice-paper plant pith* – 3 *qian*\n- *Fritillaria* (heart removed) – 3 *qian*\n- *Kelp* (washed) – 3 *qian*\n- *Alum* (calcined) – 3 *qian*\n- *Usnea* – 3 *qian*\n- *Wheat flour* – 1 *qian*\n- *Pinellia* – 1 *qian*\n\nGrind all into fine powder. Take half a *qian* per dose, mixed with warm southern wine. Avoid all toxic substances, licorice, chicken, fish, the five pungent vegetables, raw or cold fruits, and trees for efficacy.\n\n**Arisaema Paste**\nSpecifically treats skin growths and tumors on the neck and face, ranging from fist-sized to millet-sized, whether soft or hard, painless or indolent. Apply this remedy—do not rashly use acupuncture or moxibustion. Instead, carefully puncture to release qi, then apply the paste.\n*Ingredients:*\n- One large *Arisaema* (finely ground until dry; add quality vinegar to form a paste. If fresh is unavailable, dried may be used—grind into powder and mix with vinegar to form a paste).\n\nPuncture the growth slightly to allow qi to escape, then spread the paste on paper, cut to the size of the tumor, and apply. If itching occurs, do not scratch; reapply frequently for efficacy. When the paper dries, replace with a moistened application.\n\n**Chest Abscess**\nThis condition, called *Well Abscess*, arises on the chest, resembling a large bean, and develops within three to four days. Without early treatment, it descends into the abdomen. If it enters the abdomen and remains untreated, death occurs within ten days. Urgently administer *Internal Consolidation and Clear Heart Powder* (formula as previously noted). External manifestations are treatable; internal penetration injures the membranes and is undoubtedly fatal.\n\n**Nine Abscesses**\nThese include *lung abscess*, *heart abscess*, *liver abscess*, *kidney carbuncle*, *spleen abscess*, *stomach abscess*, *large intestine abscess*, *triple burner abscess*, and *small intestine carbuncle*. Examine the patient’s membranes, assess the abscess’s depth, determine the affected organ or bowel, and identify any prior consumption of mineral or stone medicines. Evaluate qi deficiency or excess—external perforation and drainage are treatable, while internal membrane injury with pus discharging through the stool is nearly incurable. Treat accordingly.\n\n**Breast Abscess in Women**\nFor *breast carbuncle*, if occurring postpartum, it is called *external blowing*; if during pregnancy, *internal blowing*. Initially, apply topical powders for urgent treatment. If pus forms, use *Promote Flesh Growth and Relieve Pain* remedies for efficacy.\n\n**Efficacy Powder**\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Angelica dahurica* – equal parts\n- *Fritillaria* (heart removed) – equal parts\n\nGrind into fine powder and take with southern wine. For blocked lactation, add *Rhaponticum* and decoct with wine for administration.\n\n**Topical Remedy for Initial Breast Abscess and Internal/External Blowing**\nUse one spoonful of yeast, mix with five *qian* of flour, stir-fry and grind until fermented dough resembles a beehive. Once fermentation turns the surface green, dry and grind into powder. Mix with well water and apply. If dry, moisten day and night. If unresolved, add *Angelica dahurica* and *Fritillaria* powder. For pain, add *Frankincense* and *Myrrh* powder for immediate efficacy.\n\nFor *breast carbuncle* and *breast abscess* with internal nodules that do not dissipate, urgently administer *Restore Origin and Unblock Qi Powder*, along with previously mentioned topical remedies, *Dissolve Toxin and Draw Out Toxin Powders*, and *Life-Saving Decoction* until sweating occurs.\n\n**Restore Origin and Unblock Qi Powder**\nTreats *breast abscess*, *breast carbuncle*, and all swelling toxins.\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Aucklandia* – equal parts\n- *Fennel* – equal parts\n- *Unripe tangerine peel* – equal parts\n- *Pangolin scales* (roasted until crisp) – equal parts\n- *Tangerine peel* – equal parts\n- *Angelica dahurica* – equal parts\n- *Licorice* – equal parts\n- *Fritillaria* (ginger-processed, heart removed) – equal parts\n- *Rhaponticum* – added\n\nGrind all into powder and take with southern wine. Alternatively, decoct with water and add wine for administration.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Unripe tangerine peel* – 1 *liang*\n- *Tangerine peel* – 1 *liang*\n- *Licorice* (raw and prepared) – 1 *liang*\n- *Pangolin scales* (roasted) – 3 *liang*\n- *Trichosanthes root* – 3 *liang*\n- *Forsythia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Honeysuckle* – 1 *liang*\n\nGrind all into powder and take with hot wine.\n\n**Breast Consumption**\nAvoid needling, as injury to the mammary ducts is fatal. Identify the condition: if the mouth opens wide, the breast is damaged and decayed. Urgently administer remedies and apply topical treatments. Failure to promote flesh growth is fatal and untreatable. Administer *Secret Transmission Flow Qi Decoction* and *Supportive Ten Proclamations Powder*, with *Dissolve Toxin, Promote Flesh Growth, and Relieve Pain Powder* applied centrally, and the previous *blowing breast* topical remedy applied around the perimeter.\n\nFor *flowering* or *pomegranate* breast abscesses, these conditions are untreatable. Those aged thirty-two or thirty-three may be treated; those over forty should seek early treatment with oral and topical remedies. Failure to promote flesh growth renders the condition untreatable and fatal.\n\n**Human Face Sore**\nThis condition arises from karmic retribution. Perform virtuous deeds to resolve it, with sincere repentance. Only then may remedies be applied. Administer *Flow Qi Decoction*; for chronic cases, take *Sophora Pill* to supplement kidney water. Apply *Dissolve Toxin, Promote Flesh Growth, and Relieve Pain Powder* for miraculous efficacy. Later, use plasters and flesh-promoting remedies to fill the sore.\n\n**Sophora Pill**\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Sophora* – 4 *liang*\n- *Saposhnikovia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Schizonepeta* – 1 *liang*\n- *Angelica dahurica* – 1 *liang*\n- *Sichuan aconite* (raw, skin removed) – 1 *liang*\n- *Red peony* – 1 *liang*\n- *Fleeceflower root* – 1 *liang*\n- *Ligusticum* – 1 *liang*\n- *Notopterygium* – 1 *liang*\n- *Gardenia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Gleditsia* – 1 *liang*\n- *Vitex* – 1 *liang*\n- *Poria* – 1 *liang*\n- *Dioscorea* – 1 *liang*\n- *Tribulus* – 3 *liang*\n- *Aconite* (stir-fried) – 3 *qian*\n- *Astragalus* – 1 *liang*\n- *Notopterygium* – 1 *liang*\n- *Typhonium* – 1 *liang* (these four ingredients are called *Four Fresh Powder*; only 3 *qian* of *Aconite* is used)",

      "translated_text": "Grind the above ingredients into a fine powder, mix with water and cooked wheat flour paste to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take thirty to fifty pills per dose, two or three times daily, on an empty stomach, swallowed with warm southern wine. For those who do not drink wine, substitute with good tea. This tonifies Kidney Water.\n\n**Chronic Outer Shin Sores**\nFor sores that persist for years without healing, this is often due to Kidney Water deficiency and downward collapse, or Spleen dampness overflowing. Take *Sophora Pill* to tonify Kidney Water, and apply *Toxin-Resolving, Flesh-Promoting, Pain-Relieving Powder*. Later, use *Interlayer Plaster*.\n\n**Secret Transmission: Interlayer Plaster**\nFor chronic, long-standing shin sores that do not heal:\n- *Old pine resin*\n- *Camphor*\n- *Milled lead* (stir-fried)\n- *Water dragon bone* (i.e., ship’s red lime)\n- *Calomel*\n\nIf unresolved, add:\n- *Angelica dahurica*\n- *Ligusticum*\n- *Mantis egg-case*\n\nGrind all into a fine powder. Melt the pine resin, add a small amount of clear oil, and mix. Prepare oil-paper bags according to the size of the sore, fill with the medicament, and bind over the wound after washing. Secure for two days; replace every four days.\n\nAlternatively, decoct *Angelica dahurica*, *Ligusticum*, and *mantis egg-case* alone to wash the sore—also effective.\n\n**Calf Abscess and Blood-Wind Sores**\nFor these two conditions:\n- If an abscess or deep-rooted sore arises on the calf, those near the genitals or anus are difficult to treat; those on fleshy areas are easier to resolve.\n- For men and women with *blood-wind sores* on the legs, if the condition flows downward, it is manageable; if it ascends to the hands, it is difficult to treat.\n\n**Dorsal Foot Sores**\nThis condition arises from *wasting-thirst* (diabetes). When it appears on the toes, it is called *gangrenous detachment*. If the sore turns red-black, it is fatal and untreatable; if not red-black, it may be treated. If treatment fails to improve it, amputate immediately—this may save the patient. Failure to amputate will lead to red-black necrosis and certain death.\n\nAt onset, it may be treated: administer *Qi-Coursing Beverage*, *Sophora Pill*, and *Toxin-Resolving, Flesh-Promoting Medicines* with urgency. Another specific remedy: boil *tung oil* and *litharge* to a boil, add a spoonful of *Sichuan pepper*, and cut *water bamboo leaves* to fit the sore. Steep for seven days, then apply the leaves alone to the sore—this will resolve it. For sores on the fingers, use the same treatment.\n\n**Kidney Yin Abscess**\nThis condition, called *suspended abscess*, manifests as swelling and pain on the scrotum. It arises when the Bladder and Kidney channels are affected by cold-damp *qi*, causing stagnation in the Yin meridians, blood and *qi* congealing, and cold-damp *qi* failing to disperse.\n\nAdminister the aforementioned *Supportive Wrapping Powder*, adding:\n- *Plantago seed*\n- *Akebia*\n- *Bland bamboo leaf*\n- *Morning glory*\n- *Fleeceflower root*\n- *Lotus stamen*\n\nAlso apply *Internal Dissipation Powder* and *Flesh-Promoting, Pain-Relieving Powder*, and cover with a plaster. Further, take the previously mentioned *Secret Transmission: Qi-Coursing Beverage*.\n\n**Lower Abscesses**\n*Secret Transmission: One-Ingredient Thousand-Gold Powder*—specifically for *scrofula*—works with miraculous efficacy. Use a single black spider (those that cross rivers are best), crush in a bowl, stir with hot southern wine, and consume in one draught. Lie on the side corresponding to the affected area. If unresolved, use another spider—this will be effective.\n\n**Topical Medicines**\nFirst, stir-fry scallion whites until hot and apply as a compress. If cooling occurs, reheat and apply three or four times. Then apply the medicine: use the aforementioned *Toxin-Transforming, Swelling-Reducing Medicine*, adding:\n- *Garlic*\n- *Momordica*\n- *Arisaema*\n- *Wild aconite*\n\nFor ruptured sores, use the aforementioned *Flesh-Promoting, Pain-Relieving Medicine*. Apply *Unblocking Medicine* three to five times as needed.\n\n**Unblocking Medicine**\n- *Morning glory*\n- *Realgar*\n- *Toosendan*\n- *Rhubarb*\n- *Licorice node*\n- *Trichosanthes root*\n- *Bitter orange*\n- *Fritillaria* (equal parts)\n\nGrind into powder. Take on an empty stomach with southern wine; discontinue once pus is discharged.\n\n**Alternative Formula**\n- *Asarum*\n- *Coptis*\n- *Pangolin scales*\n- *Frankincense*\n- *Myrrh*\n- *Forsythia*\n- *Tangkuei tail*\n- *Rhubarb*\n- *Gardenia*\n- *Honeysuckle*\n- *Oyster shell*\n- *Plantago seed*\n- *Saposhnikovia*\n- *Licorice*\n- *Oil walnut*\n\nChop, decoct in water until done, add southern wine, and take warm at dawn. For *unilateral Kidney qi*, this works with divine efficacy. First, take *Five-Ingredient Powder with Poria*, adding:\n- *Virgate wormwood*\n- *Rush pith*\n- *Akebia*\n- *White atractylodes*\n- *Red poria*\n- *Alisma*\n- *Cinnamon*\n\nChop, decoct in water, and take on an empty stomach. Then apply moxibustion as described below for best results.\n\nLater, take *Aucklandia Pill*: toast one dose with a large *blister beetle*, remove the beetle, and take with hot southern wine. If unresolved, take one or two more doses.\n\nAnother formula: decoct *chestnut tree root* in southern wine—this works immediately.\n\n**Chancre Topical Medicine**\n- *Coptis*\n- *Phellodendron* (equal parts)\n\nFirst, soak the two ingredients in the juice of two pig gallbladders until moist. Then place on a tile or brick heated over fire to dry. Add:\n- *Frankincense*\n- *Myrrh*\n- *Mirabilite*\n- *Calcined alum*\n- *Litharge*\n- *Chinese sumac gallnut*\n- *Scorpion*\n- *Sophora*\n\nGrind into powder.

Each dose weighs five *qian*. For the first dose, add *lycopus leaf* and a small amount of *honeysuckle* (one *qian* each), along with one *liang* of fresh ginger. Pound together, then decoct with good wine and consume hot. For those who do not drink, decoct with water and a small amount of wine—this is also effective. Then decoct one and a half cups each of wine and water with ten slices of ginger, consume hot, and cover with clothing and bedding until sweating occurs. Once the condition improves, add two *qian* of *rhubarb* to the previous formula, decoct hot, and consume. Purging once or twice will eliminate residual toxins.\n\nThough the formula’s ingredients may seem incongruous, repeated use has proven its efficacy without fail. If other symptoms arise, adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nFor vexation and vomiting, add one *qian* of *licorice node* and take with fermented bean curd water (ingredients above ground separately into powder).\nFor retching and nausea, add *frankincense* and take with *licorice* decoction mixed with bean powder. Alternatively, grind *purple lotus placenta* and old ginger with a mouthful of rice vinegar and consume.\nFor vexation and vomiting due to latent summerheat, use *Cinnabar Five-Ingredient Powder*.\nFor persistent retching, add *clove* and *lotus seed* to the previous decoction. If unresolved, use *Unchanging Metal Qi-Righting Powder* with *ginseng* and *costus root*.\nFor unceasing retching with cold limbs (termed \"water-drinking\"), take *Coptis and Elsholtzia Powder* with *Summerheat-Dispersing Pill*.\nFor cold hands and feet, use *chaenomeles* and *morning glory seed*.\nFor vexation, add *ophiopogon*, *red peony*, *gardenia*, and *rush pith*.\nFor tidal fever, add *bupleurum*, *scutellaria*, *bamboo leaf*, and *imperata root*.\nFor dim vision, add a small amount of *cinnabar*, *realgar*, and *musk*.\nFor abdominal distension, add *coix seed* and *calcium sulfate*.\nFor spontaneous diarrhea, add *white atractylodes*, *poria*, *nutmeg*, and *poppy husk*.\nFor unceasing abdominal pain, add *costus root* and *frankincense*.\nFor panting and cough, add *anemarrhena*, *fritillaria*, and a small amount of *rock sugar*.\nFor headache, add *ligusticum*, *angelica dahurica*, and *scallion white*.\nFor unceasing pain, pound *radish seed*, *ligusticum*, and *scallion white* and apply to the temples.\nFor copious phlegm and drool, pound fresh *mugwort* leaf tips with rice vinegar, extract the juice, and gargle to expel phlegm.\nFor sore throat, decoct *menispermum*, *mirabilite root*, *gardenia*, *bamboo leaf*, *mugwort*, and *rush pith* and gargle.\nFor constipation, use *red peony* (ginger-processed), *areca husk* (bran-fried), and *areca peel*.\nFor urinary retention, use *red peony*, *red poria*, *akebia*, *plantago seed*, and *rush pith*.\nFor bloody urine, use *rehmannia* and *plantago seed*.\nFor nosebleed, use *safflower*, *rehmannia*, *lotus rhizome node*, and *ginger peel* (fresh).\nIf the sore is painless and fails to rise, apply three cones of moxa.

Wrap the pills in the scallion and swallow with three to four cups of unfiltered hot wine. Rest in a draft-free area, covered with clothing and bedding. After the time it takes to walk five *li*, consume several more cups of hot wine to reinforce the medicine’s power. Profuse sweating is the desired effect. If sweating does not occur in severe cases, take two more pills. Sweating will then ensue, and the effect will be achieved. At the first sign of illness, two pills will resolve it; for severe cases of three to five days’ duration, take two more pills. If the *ding*-sore has *walked yellow* and reached the heart, it is difficult to treat. If cold sweats occur, the patient will die. If the patient cannot chew scallion, pound it and wrap the pills for swallowing with wine. For sores on the upper body, take after meals; for sores on the lower body, take before meals. After consumption, avoid cold water, cucumber, eggplant, oily noodles, pork, mutton, offal, fish, and all wind- and sore-provoking foods, as well as women’s laundry with fox odor.

      "translated_text": "**Treatise on Miscellaneous Conditions**\n\n**Rescuing the Hanged:**\nFrom dawn to dusk, even if the body is already cold, life may still be restored. If the region below the heart retains the slightest warmth, even after a full day, revival is possible. Immediately embrace the deceased to loosen the noose, remove the rope—*never cut it*. Gently adjust the throat to its proper position, lay the body flat, and cover with a quilt. Urgently blow into both ears through bamboo tubes. Have one person firmly grasp the hair without releasing, while stepping on both shoulders with the feet. Another should massage the chest and flex the limbs, kneading and stretching them. If revived, administer thin congee. This method revives all without fail.\n\n**Rescuing the Drowned:**\nFirst, pry open the drowned person’s mouth with a knife and place a chopstick horizontally between the teeth to allow water to drain. Alternatively, invert a jar or steamer, lay the drowned person’s abdomen over it, letting the head hang downward to expel water. If no jar or steamer is available, a round log may be used. After water is expelled, have a strong man carry the deceased on his back, with the legs draped over the shoulders, walking to force out all remaining water. Then, take a clod of wall earth, place it on the ground, and lay the drowned person supine upon it, covering the body with more wall earth—leaving only the mouth and eyes exposed. Naturally, the water’s qi will be absorbed into the earth, and the person may revive. Immediately blow alternately into the mouth, ears, nose, navel, and anus through bamboo tubes to restore the flow of qi between upper and lower. Also, insufflate a small amount of *pinellia* powder into the nostrils. If slightly revived, administer thin congee.\n\nAnother method from Sun Simiao for rescuing the drowned: urgently loosen the deceased’s clothing and sash, then apply moxa to the navel to revive.\n\n**Rescuing Those Frozen in Winter After Falling into Water:**\nIf the limbs are cold, speech is lost, and only faint breath remains, do not immediately apply fire. Instead, fill a cloth bag with hot ashes and place it over the heart. Replace with fresh hot ashes as it cools. Once the eyes open, administer warm wine or rice broth.\n\n**Rescuing Those Who Have Collapsed from Summer Heat:**\nDo not expose to cold, for cold will cause death. Use warm water to continuously massage and wash the area between the heart and abdomen. If urgently needed on the road, place hot roadside earth over the abdomen and navel, and have someone urinate into the navel to revive.\n\n**Rescuing Those Who Have Collapsed from Heatstroke and Thirst:**\nMash equal parts of hot roadside earth and garlic, mix with water, strain, and administer the liquid to revive.\n\n**Rescuing Sudden Windstroke with Loss of Consciousness, Often Due to Phlegm Obstruction:**\nUse two *qian* of raw *alunite*, ground into powder, and mixed with fresh ginger juice.

Take two *qian* per dose with seven-boiling water.\n*[Note: \"触衣\" refers to inner garments.]*\n\n**Seventh Critical Condition: Yang Collapse**\nAcute pain in the lower abdomen, retracted testicles, blackened complexion, panting, and spontaneous cold sweating.\n*Formula:* Pound three stalks of scallion (with roots intact) in a stone mortar, decoct with five *sheng* of wine until reduced to two *sheng*, and administer in two doses. First apply heated salt to the *Qihai* point below the navel, ensuring the warmth is retained.\n\n**Eighth Critical Condition: Ghostly Nightmare or Ghostly Assault**\nStruck by a ghost in the bedchamber, making sounds and crying out without awareness.\n*Formula:* Crush *zaoxintu* (hearth soil) into powder, take two *qian* per dose with freshly drawn water, and blow a half-fingernail’s pinch into the nostrils. Also moxibust the *Jumao* point between the big toes for twenty-one cones.\n*Alternative Formula:* Decoct three seven-inch branches each of peach and willow (east-facing growth) in three bowls of water, and administer warm.\n\n**Ninth Critical Condition: Breech Birth**\n*Formula:* Grind seven *Sophora* seeds finely and administer with freshly drawn downstream water.\n*Alternative Formula:* Burn one shed snake skin, fourteen cicada molts, and a lock of hair into ash, take in three doses with warm wine, and lie supine for a moment to facilitate delivery.\n*Another Formula:* Prick the soles of the infant’s feet three to five times with a fine needle, then apply salt to the punctures to prompt proper delivery.\n\n**Tenth Critical Condition: Retained Placenta**\nStagnant blood surging upward, causing delirium, with the placenta ascending.\n*Formula:* Stir-fry one *sheng* of red adzuki beans, decoct in three *sheng* of water until reduced to two *sheng*, strain, and administer the liquid warm for immediate expulsion.\n*Alternative Method:* Burn the woman’s own fingernails and toenails into ash, take with wine in one dose, then have a strong woman lift her while using a bamboo tube to press downward over the heart for efficacy.\n\n**Prescriptions for Childbirth**\nWhen a woman nears labor with lumbar and abdominal pain, do not hastily administer labor-inducing charms or drugs, nor allow her to squat prematurely. She should remain active and composed. If the infant is fully developed, it will emerge naturally when the qi is sufficient. Premature induction risks transverse or breech birth, leading to fatal complications—such self-inflicted harm is avoidable. Verified formulas follow.\n\n**Purple Perilla Drink**\nTreats all prenatal conditions in women. This formula both calms and induces labor, pacifying the fetus and regulating qi—its efficacy is profound and indescribable.\n*Ingredients:*\n- Purple perilla leaves, 1 *liang* (fire-dried)\n- Areca peel, washed and dried, stir-fried with fresh ginger juice\n- Ginseng, ½ *liang*\n- Aged tangerine peel, ½ *liang* (remove pith, stir-fried)\n- *Chuanxiong*, 8 *qian*\n- Licorice, ½ *liang* (honey-fried)\n- Northern white peony, 4 *qian* (lightly stir-fried)\n- *Chuandanggui*, 1 *liang* (lightly stir-fried)\n\n*Preparation:* Chop the ingredients. For each dose, decoct 3 *qian* with three slices of fresh ginger and a three-inch scallion stalk, and take on an empty stomach.\n*For the seventh or eighth month of pregnancy:* Add ½ *liang* of *zhike* (soaked in rice water, stir-fried after removing the pith) and 3 *qian* of cardamom (stir-fried). Take once daily. At labor, decoct with downstream water.\n*When labor pains begin in waves:* Grind a piece of high-quality *ruxiang* (frankincense) the size of a little finger into a thick paste with 1 *ge* of water, administer warm, and wait until the waters break before taking labor-inducing drugs.\n\n**Labor-Inducing Formula**\n*Ingredients:* One handful of *zuosheng* branches (one *chi* long, thoroughly washed) and a five-inch piece of licorice, both chopped.\n*Preparation:* Decoct in seven bowls of water in an earthenware pot, seal tightly with paper, and simmer until reduced by half. When the mother’s labor pains intensify, administer one cup warm. No more than two doses are needed; a sensation of downward pressure signals imminent delivery.\n*This formula also treats transverse or breech birth, retained stillborn fetus with putrefaction, or prolonged retention. Repeatedly verified.*\n*Alternative Formula:* Mix equal parts *baicaoshuang* (soot from kitchen stoves) and *baizhi* into powder, knead with boy’s urine and a little vinegar into a paste, and administer with hot water.\n*Another Formula:* Burn the wooden shavings from an axe’s eye (where the handle fits) to ash, and administer with swiftly flowing water.\n*For retained placenta pressing against the heart:* Burn snake skin to ash, mix with a small amount of musk, grind finely, and administer with warm wine for immediate delivery.\n\n**Retained Placenta**\n*Formula:* Separate the whites from three eggs, mix with 1 *ge* of sour vinegar, and have the woman sip it to expel the placenta.\n*Alternative Method:* Have the woman hold the end of her own hair in her mouth to induce retching, prompting expulsion.\n*Another Formula:* Peel and grind fourteen castor beans, apply the paste to the soles of her feet, and the placenta will descend. Wash off immediately. If the uterus prolapses, apply the same paste to the crown of the head to retract it. This remedy is harmless if used repeatedly; wash off once the uterus returns.\n\n**Postpartum Blood Surge**\nWhen stagnant blood rushes upward, causing blood faint (resembling sudden death), decoct aged mugwort in water with vinegar and administer.\n\n**Uterine Flooding**\n*Formula:* Grind *huangqin* into powder, take 2 *qian* per dose with wine heated by a red-hot iron scale weight.\n*Alternative Formula:* Burn lotus seedpods to ash, take 2 *qian* per dose with wine.\n*Another Formula:* Burn cotton, palm fiber, and hair to ash, mix with *baicaoshuang*, grind into powder, and administer with ash-free wine.\n\n**Jiyin Elixir**\nTreats all women’s ailments.\n*Ingredients:*\n- *Xiangfuzhi* (nutgrass)\n- Black soybeans\n- Dried ginger\n- *Cangzhu* (atractylodes)\n\n*Preparation:* Weigh four *liang* of each.

      "translated_text": "Grind the above into powder, mix with saliva to form a small cake, place in the navel, and apply moxa cones atop it. Cease when heat penetrates the abdomen, regardless of the number of cones used. After moxibustion, wipe the area with a warm, damp cloth to remove toxins. This method has repeatedly saved lives.\n\n**Treating Malaria**\nTake 7 *qian* of *haochangshan* (dichroa root) and 3 *qian* of *binglang* (areca nut). Grind into fine powder, mix with egg white, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take 30 pills per dose with warm wine or vinegar decoction. Administer once the night before onset and again at dawn on the day of onset—highly effective. For chronic cases, increase dosage to achieve results.\n\nAnother method: Slice *changshan* (dichroa root), mix thoroughly with egg white, steam over rice three times, discard the egg white, dry the *changshan* in the sun, grind into powder, and form into pills with cooked rice. Take 20 pills before bed and at dawn with wine—cures without inducing vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nAnother remedy: *Qinghao* (sweet wormwood) and *bo gui* (thin cinnamon bark), each ground into powder. For predominantly cold malaria, use more cinnamon and less wormwood; for predominantly hot malaria, use more wormwood and less cinnamon. Pound 2 *liang* of fresh ginger (with skin) to extract juice, mix with hot wine, and consume. Cover with blankets and rest to recover.\n\nAnother method: Regardless of chronic or recent onset, highly effective. Take 1 *liang* of *changshan* (dichroa root), thin as chicken bones, chop, soak in good vinegar overnight, then cook in an earthenware vessel until dry. Grind into powder, take 2 *qian* per dose, decoct in 1 cup of water until reduced to half, strain, and cool. Administer at dawn—divinely effective without inducing vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nAnother remedy: Equal parts *zhimu* (anemarrhena), *beimu* (fritillaria), *changshan* (dichroa root), and *binglang* (areca nut). Chop, decoct in equal parts water and wine until reduced to half, strain, cover with silk, and expose to dew overnight. At dawn, consume cold while facing east. Effective for all types of malaria, even chronic cases unresponsive for years—relief after one dose. However, women must not prepare the decoction.\n\n**Treating Red and White Dysentery**\nTake 6 *hezi* (chebula fruit), roast 6 until cooked and use 6 raw. Remove pits, dry the flesh, and grind into powder. For red dysentery, take with a decoction of raw *gancao* (licorice); for white dysentery, take with a decoction of roasted *gancao*. Administer on an empty stomach—severe cases require no more than two doses.\n\n**Dysentery Pills**\nTake 2 large *banxia* (pinellia), 7 shelled *badou* (croton seeds), 1 *qian* of *baicaoshuang* (soot from burned herbs), and 1 piece of *jingmo* (ink stick) the size of *banxia*. Grind all into powder, mix with 3 *qian* of yellow wax and a small amount of clear oil, and form into pills the size of mung beans. Take 7 pills per dose: for red dysentery, with *gancao* (licorice) decoction; for white dysentery, with *ganjiang* (dried ginger) decoction; for tenesmus, with *zhiqiao* (bitter orange) decoction; for food stagnation and cold-induced diarrhea, take cold with *ganjiang* decoction; for summer heat diarrhea, take with cold boiled water. Divine efficacy beyond description.\n\n**Treating Aphthous Dysentery**\nThis condition may be cold, hot, or a mix of both. First disperse exterior and interior conditions. If palms are hot and eyes red, it is heat—use *Baidu San* (Antiphlogistic Powder) with *chenmi* (aged rice) decoction. If palms are cold and pure white dysentery occurs, it is cold—grind *lianrou* (lotus seed, with heart intact) into powder, mix with rice water, and take 3 *qian* per dose. Once able to eat, treat according to cold or heat symptoms.\n\nAnother remedy: Use *hongmujin* flowers (without stems), dry in shade, and grind into powder. Prepare two wheat flour pancakes, sprinkle the flower powder on top, and consume. Before eating, force the mouth open with water to administer the powder.\n\nAnother remedy for heat dysentery: Equal parts *chaihu* (bupleurum) and *huangqin* (scutellaria). Decoct in half water and half wine until reduced to 70%, cool, and take on an empty stomach or in the morning. For bloody dysentery, increase *huangqin*.\n\nAnother remedy: Remove the pit from 1 *wumei* (mume fruit), mix with fine spring tea powder, and take with vinegar decoction.\n\n**Treating Cramping Diarrhea**\nDecoct *chen’ai* (aged mugwort) and *mugua* (chaenomeles) in water, add a small amount of vinegar, and take a pinch.\n\nAnother method: Decoct 3 *qian* of *wuzhuyu* (evodia) with mugwort in 1½ cups of water, divide into three doses—immediately effective.\n\nIf herbs are unavailable, simply decoct *aiye* (mugwort) and fresh ginger together and take hot.\n\n**Treating Intestinal Colic (Sha Syndrome)**\nOnset causes unbearable abdominal pain. For *yin sha* (cold colic), the abdomen hurts and limbs are cold. Locate red spots on the body and burn them with an oil-dipped rush wick. For *yang sha* (hot colic), the abdomen hurts and limbs are warm. Prick the back of the fingers near the nails (about 1.5 *fen*) where the skin moves—bleeding brings relief. First, massage both arms downward to gather stagnant blood at the fingertips for bleeding.\n\nIf pain is unbearable and risks death (anciently called \"dry cholera\"), urgently dissolve 1 *liang* of salt in hot water and pour into the patient’s mouth—relief comes when salt reaches the abdomen.\n\nAnother remedy: Stir-fry stones until red, quench in cold water, and drink 1–2 *ge* of the clear liquid.\n\nAnother remedy: Equal parts *chenzhangmu* (aged camphor wood), *chenpi* (aged tangerine peel), and *chenbitutu* (aged wall earth). Decoct thickly, strain, and take 3–4 consecutive doses for relief.\n\n**Treating Cholera with Vomiting and Diarrhea (Unresponsive to Other Medicines)**\nGrind 49 *lüdou* (mung beans) and 49 *hujiao* (black peppercorns) into powder, decoct in water, and take. For severe thirst, grind into fine powder and take with fresh well water—divinely effective.\n\n**Treating Uncontrollable Cholera Diarrhea**\nDecoct 1 handful of fresh *ai* (mugwort) in 2 cups of water until reduced to 1 cup, and take all at once. If fresh mugwort is unavailable, use a thick decoction of aged mugwort leaves.\n\nAnother remedy: 1 *liang* of *mugua* (chaenomeles), ½ *liang* of *zhuyu* (evodia, soaked in hot water seven times), 2 *qian* of *huixiang* (fennel), and 2 *qian* of *gancao* (licorice). Chop, take 4 *qian* per dose, decoct in 1½ cups of water with 3 slices of ginger and 10 *zisu* (perilla) leaves. Take on an empty stomach.",
      "overlap_context": " (angelica)\n\nGrind equal parts into powder. Take 3 *qian* per dose, decoct in 1½ cups of water with 3 slices of fresh ginger until reduced to 80%. Administer two consecutive doses.\nFor headache, add 3 stalks of *cong* (scallion) with roots.\nFor qi stagnation and abdominal fullness, add *zhiqiao* (bitter orange).\nSafe for postpartum women, infants, and the elderly, with divine efficacy.\n\n**Treating Febrile Chest Bind**\nUse 7 inches of *dahuanglian* (rhubarb) and 14 shelled *badou* (croton seeds).",

      "translated_text": "**Moxibustion Method for Early-Stage Carbuncles and Back Boils (Repeatedly Tested and Verified)**\nAt the first sign of a carbuncle or back boil—whether already formed or not—if there is redness, heat, swelling, and pain, cover the area with damp paper and observe where it dries first; this marks the head of the boil. Slice a large garlic clove into pieces the thickness of a *dang* coin (approx. 3 *qian*), place one slice on the head, and apply moxibustion with three *zhuang* of mugwort. Replace the garlic slice and continue moxibustion: if painful, moxa until pain ceases; if painless, moxa until pain arises. Early detection and prompt moxibustion yield the best results. For boils present one or two days, ten moxibustions cure ten cases; for three or four days, six or seven cures; for five or six days, three or four cures. After seven days, moxibustion is no longer effective. If multiple heads cluster in one area, grind garlic into a paste, form a cake, place it over the boil heads, and burn mugwort atop it—this will also bring relief. If a red swelling on the back contains a yellow kernel like a millet grain, slice a single garlic clove and apply moxibustion as above; the next day, remove the scab, and the pus will have already discharged.\n\n**Bamboo Tube Suction Method for Toxins (Effective for All Malignant Sores)**\nSelect a section of bitter bamboo one to two *cun* long, preferably with a node at one end. Scrape the green outer layer until paper-thin, adjusting the tube’s size to match the sore. Best used at the onset of toxic sores.\n**Ingredients:**\n- *Baijili* (white caltrop) – 5 *qian*\n- *Cangzhu* (atractylodes) – 5 *qian*\n- *Wujupi* (Chinese tallow tree bark) – 5 *qian*\n- *Houpo* (magnolia bark) – 5 *qian*\n\nChop the four ingredients, decoct with the bamboo tube in one *diao* of water until the medicine is exhausted. While the tube is hot, press it onto the sore; soon, it will adhere on its own without manual pressure. Prepare another tube with the same proportions of medicine. When the first tube cools, remove it and replace it with a hot one, repeating the process. The pus will be drawn into the tube, and the sore will heal.\n\n**Tenfold Diffusion Powder for Carbuncles and Boils**\nAll carbuncles and boils arise from stagnation of qi and blood, obstruction by wind-toxins. This formula disperses wind-evil, promotes the flow of qi and blood, drains pus, relieves pain, generates flesh, and closes wounds. For unformed sores, it swiftly dissipates them; for formed sores, it hastens suppuration. Without testing the five toxins, one may still achieve efficacy.\nMaster Xu states: Once, a patient with a back sore failed to heal with various medicines. This formula was administered—five to six *qian* dissolved in one *sheng* of warm wine. Shortly after, the pain diminished by seventy percent. After several doses, the sore suppurated, and within half a month, the wound closed. Another case involved a woman with a bowl-sized swelling on her thigh, which resolved with this treatment. A patient with a cranial boil took the medicine, drank to intoxication, and slept; upon waking, the ailment was gone. The key lies in selecting high-quality ingredients and administering ample doses. Continue taking the medicine even after the wound closes to replenish prior depletion and prevent future recurrence. For those who do not drink, it may also be taken with a thick decoction of *muxiang* (costus root), though a small amount of wine is preferable.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- *Renshen* (ginseng, preferably from Silla) – remove the root head, finely chop, and dry-fry\n- *Danggui* (Chinese angelica, large Sichuan variety resembling a horse’s tail) – wash thoroughly, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Huangqi* (astragalus, silky variety, unbranched like an arrow shaft over a *chi* long) – wash, cut into *cun* sections, crush, split into strands, soak in saltwater until saturated, then gently roast until supple, and slice\n- *Chuanxiong* (Sichuan lovage, high-quality) – wash, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Fangfeng* (saposhnikovia, freshly fragrant) – wash, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Houpo* (magnolia bark, thick and purple) – remove coarse bark, soak in ginger juice overnight, then stir-fry and dry-fry\n- *Gancao* (licorice)\n- *Jiegeng* (platycodon, with a bitter-tasting core) – wash, remove root head, slice, and dry-fry\n- *Baizhi* (angelica dahurica)\n- *Rougui* (cinnamon, thinly rolled) – remove coarse bark, avoid fire exposure\n\nTake the first nine ingredients in their purest, driest form, weigh, and grind into powder. *Renshen*, *danggui*, and *huangqi* each use two *liang*; the remaining seven ingredients each use one *liang*. Add *rougui* and blend evenly. Dosage: three *qian*, increasing to five or six *qian*. Purchase ample *rougui*, remove impurities, and weigh the pure powder. With sincere preparation and generous dosing, efficacy is assured.\n\n**Yellow Wax Pill for Back Boils, Carbuncles, and All Malignant Sores**\nA patient with sores resembling snake heads covering the body also found relief with this remedy.\nUse any amount of raw *baifan* (alum), grind into powder, and for every *liang* of alum, melt seven *qian* of yellow wax (remove from heat before mixing). Combine evenly and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Dosage: ten to twenty or thirty pills, taken at any time with rice water or warm boiled water. For unruptured sores, it resolves them internally; for ruptured sores, it promotes closure. Typically, efficacy is achieved within ten or so doses. For sores caused by mineral or metal drug toxicity, this remedy is also suitable. Alternatively, take one to two spoonfuls of raw alum powder with warm water—equally effective. Use mountain wax, yellow in color, for best results. This formula does not disturb the viscera, relieves pain, and is safe for the elderly, weak, or infirm. It powerfully protects the membranes, rescues the heart, and prevents heat-toxin from attacking internally, averting critical danger. Its wonders are beyond description.\n\n**Oak Leaf Decoction for Back Boils and Carbuncles (Formed or Unformed)**\nSimple, inexpensive, and ideal for aiding the poor.\n**Ingredients:**\n- Dried oak leaves – 4 *liang*\n- Dried lotus leaf heart and stem – 1 *liang*\n- *Xuancaogen* (daylily root) – 1 *liang*\n- *Gancaojie* (licorice nodes) – 1 *liang*\n- *Diyu* (burnet) – 1 *liang*\n\nChop into a powder. Dosage: half a *liang* per serving, decoct in two bowls of water until reduced to half a bowl, and divide into two doses. Take morning and evening until the condition resolves. For formed sores, it promotes suppuration; for unformed sores, it induces resolution. Avoid all toxic foods.\n\n**Additional Remedy for Carbuncles and Boils**\nGrind *jilongying* leaves (from a chicken coop) into a paste, add a small amount of *guan* (salt), and apply, leaving the boil head exposed—immediately effective.\n\n**Treatment for Scrofula (Regardless of Ruptured or Unruptured)**\nPierce the top of a black chicken egg, stir the yolk and white evenly, then tie a *banmao* (blister beetle) with string—removing its head, wings, and legs—and insert it into the egg. Seal with paper, steam over rice, peel the shell, remove the beetle, and consume the egg on an empty stomach, one per day, until healed.",

Then crush *juhua* (chrysanthemum) leaves, stems, and roots with wine and drink; for those who do not drink, use a decoction. By the following evening, remove the plum—the sore will have ruptured.\n\n**Another Remedy**\nGrind fresh honey with year-old scallions into a paste.

Mix with clear oil, place in oiled silk, and apply to the sore, securing it with cloth. Even if the sore itches, do not disturb it with the hands. Leave in place for several tens of days until the sore heals, then remove.\n\n**Treatment for Stubborn Sores and Scabies**\nGrind equal parts *xionghuang* (realgar), *liuhuang* (sulfur), *huanglian* (coptis), *shechuangzi* (cnidium seed), and *jiandaocao* (sheargrass), then dry-bake. Fry seven *badou* (croton seeds) in sesame oil until black, discard the seeds, and once the oil cools, add high-quality *qingfen*. Mix with the prepared powder and apply.\n\n**Palm-Rubbing Powder (Hezhang San) for Various Scabies and Leprous Sores**\nGrind one and a half *liang* of *madouling* (birthwort fruit) into powder. Separately grind two and a half *qian* of *baifan* (alum) and three *qian* of *liuhuang* (sulfur).

For ruptured abscesses, apply the powder with fresh oil.\n\n**Alternative Remedy**\nBurn *zaojiao* (Chinese honey locust pods) to ash, blend with *bengfen* (clam shell powder), and take with wine, massaging the breast to disperse the swelling.\n\n**Alternative Remedy**\nBurn *zongzhu* (reed leaves used for wrapping zongzi) collected on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month to ash, mix with wine, and drink—repeatedly effective.\n\n**Another Remedy**\nCrush *mabiancao* (verbena) with wine, stir-fry until brittle, and add a piece of ginger. Drink one or two bowls while hot, then apply the dregs to the affected area.\n\n**Treatment for Water-Damp Sores (Shuihengchuang)**\nRemove the kernel from one *zhizi* (gardenia fruit), insert a piece of *baifan* (alum), and roast in fire. Grind the entire mixture (including the shell) into powder and apply to the sore. First wash the sore with water before applying the powder.\n\n**Treatment for Gan Sores (Ganchuang)**\nCalcine *lugaoshi* (calamine) with fire, quench in vinegar, and grind into powder. Mix with oil and apply; adding *xiangcha* (fragrant tea) or *hai’erni* (child’s clay) enhances the effect.\n\n**Alternative Remedy**\nCrush fresh *yinxing* (ginkgo nuts) and apply. Also effective for pubic lice.\n\n**Alternative Remedy**\nMix *huangbo* (phellodendron bark) with egg white, stir-fry three to five times, grind into powder, and blend with clear oil. For damp sores, dust the powder directly.\n\n**Another Remedy**\nBurn one whole *ganlan* (olive) to ash, mix with oil, and apply.",
      "overlap_context": "nto a paste, add a small amount of *guan* (salt), and apply, leaving the boil head exposed—immediately effective.\n\n**Treatment for Scrofula (Regardless of Ruptured or Unruptured)**\nPierce the top of a black chicken egg, stir the yolk and white evenly, then tie a *banmao* (blister beetle) with string—removing its head, wings, and legs—and insert it into the egg.

It should be taken at dawn on an empty stomach.\n\nFor swelling in the feet and knees, after taking the medicine, lie down with both legs raised to allow the water to flow toward the feet, discharging through urination and defecation, which will naturally reduce the swelling. On the day of administration, no other medicines should be taken. **Avoid licorice entirely**, and abstain from salt for half a year to prevent recurrence.\n\nThis medicine should not be taken in excess, nor should it be taken daily. If a single dose fails to expel all the water, administer it once every three days. On the remaining two days, take a decoction of *Shengliao Wuling San* and *Jiahe San* combined, prepared with ginger and jujube, to regulate the spleen, stimulate appetite, and promote diuresis, thereby resolving the swelling.\n\n**For bloody stool:**\n- Burn *wumei* (mume fruit) to preserve its properties, then form into pills with vinegar-cooked rice paste, to be taken with either hot water or wine.\n- Alternatively, dry-fry *huanglian* (coptis) and *baizhi* (cypress leaf), grind into powder, and take on an empty stomach with wine.\n- Another method: Grind *jingjiesui* (schizonepeta spike) and *sharen* (amomum fruit) into powder.

      "translated_text": "For fish bones lodged in the throat, place a fish bone atop the crown of the head—the bone will descend. Another formula: regardless of whether the bone is from chicken or fish, grind *poxiao* (mirabilite) finely, mix with *jisu* (catnip), and form into pills the size of a marble.

Coat with *qingdai* (indigo), thread with string, and hang in a windy place. For each dose, dissolve one pill in cold water and administer.\n\nFor venomous snakebites, promptly drink one or two bowls of good vinegar to prevent the poison from spreading with the blood, or consume one or two cups of clear oil as an alternative. Then apply medicine, or first bind the wound tightly with a headband at both ends. Next, take *baizhi* (angelica root) powder, mix with plain water, and consume about half a *liang*—soon after, yellow fluid will drain from the bite, the swelling will subside, and the skin will close. Another formula: apply *xionghuang* (realgar) powder topically. Another: dissolve and consume it in water. Another formula: grind equal parts *baifan* (alum), *xionghuang* (realgar), and *huangla* (yellow wax) into powder, form into pills the size of a fingertip, and melt one on a spoon over heat when treating a bite. Drip the melted liquid onto the wound, or use a bamboo tube to direct it inward—the poison will not spread, which is especially effective.\n\nFor insects entering the ear, pound leek juice with vinegar and pour into the ear. Another method: warm peach leaves over fire and plug the ear—the insect will emerge immediately. Another: pour clear oil into the ear, and the insect will exit.

      "translated_text": "For long-term deafness with no hearing:\nTake a piece of *cishi* (magnetite) the size of a soybean, and a pinch of *shexiang* (musk). Seal them in a bamboo tube with *tuohe* oil (camel-goose oil). Wrap in fresh cotton and insert into the affected ear, while holding a small piece of raw iron in the mouth. When a sound like wind or rain is felt inside the ear, the condition will be cured. Repeat three to five times for full effect.\n\nFor bites from venomous insects:\nMake a large paper wick, dip it in sesame oil, and light it as a lamp. Hold the flame near the wound to fumigate it—the poison will be drawn into the lamp’s smoke.\n\nFor abdominal pain caused by accidentally swallowing a leech:\nForm clay into pills and swallow them with water. The leech will be expelled with the clay in the stool.\n\nFor spider sores:\nApply sheep’s milk to the affected area, or rub with clear oil to soothe it.\n\nFor rabid dog bites:\nPound scallion roots to extract the juice and consume a large amount. Alternatively, decoct *taobaipi* (white bark of the peach tree) and drink the liquid, or apply moxibustion to the wound three to five times. Another method: grind *zhen danfan* (true chalcanthite) into powder and apply it to the wound for immediate healing.\n\nFor centipede bites:\nChew *zhuyu* (evodia fruit) and rub it on the bite. Alternatively, apply chicken droppings, or mix ginger juice with *bangfen* (freshwater clam powder) and apply. Another method: cut into mulberry tree bark to extract the sap and apply it for immediate healing. If the pain is unbearable, apply moxibustion to the wound three to five times. Another remedy: light a lamp with clear oil and rush pith, then use the smoke to fumigate the bite—this will stop the pain. This method is also effective for other venomous insect bites and is highly reliable.\n\nFor wasp stings:\nWash the sting with warm wine for immediate relief, or apply clear oil.\n\nFor tiger wounds:\nFirst drink a bowl of clear oil, then wash the wound with oil. Alternatively, decoct *gan’ge* (kudzu root) in water and use it to wash the wound. Another method: mix brown sugar with water and apply it to the wound, while also drinking one or two bowls of brown sugar water.\n\nFor snakebite remedies:\nGrind the following into powder:\n- *Xixin* (asarum) – five *qian*\n- *Baizhi* (angelica) – five *qian*\n- *Xionghuang* (realgar) – two and a half *qian*\n\nAdd a small amount of *shexiang* (musk). Take two *qian* per dose, mixed with warm wine. Another remedy: grind *beimu* (fritillaria) into powder, mix with cold wine, and drink as much as possible. Use aged wine, as it will cause clear fluid to flow from the wound. Once the fluid is fully discharged, apply the dregs of the medicine to the wound for healing.\n\nFor scalds and burns:\nGrind charcoal into a paste with water and apply, or grind *tuzhu* (cinnabar) and apply. Alternatively, apply pure tung oil. Another method: pound *baiye* (cypress leaves) into a paste and apply to the painful area, or pound *huangshukui* (yellow hollyhock) flowers and leaves and apply. For all scalds and burns, immediately warm the affected area by the fire. Though painful, endure it for the duration of a meal, and the pain will cease. Do not apply cold water or cold objects, as this will trap heat and cause the flesh to rot—guard against this.\n\nFor cuts and axe wounds with unstoppable bleeding and unbearable pain:\nStir-fry scallion whites in a wok until hot, then pound them into a paste. Apply while hot and bind securely—the pain and bleeding will stop immediately. Replace with fresh scallions when they cool. Alternatively, pound scallion leaves into a paste, stir-fry until hot, and apply. Another method: grind aged lime into a fine powder, mix with an equal amount of *dahuang* (rhubarb), and stir-fry until the mixture turns pink. Apply to the wound. Another remedy: calcine and grind *guodi mo* (soot from the bottom of a wok) and apply. Another method: grind *baiji* (bletilla) and calcined *shigao* (gypsum) together into powder and sprinkle on the wound to close it. Another remedy: apply *wumingyi* (no-name mineral) powder.\n\nFor sprains and strains causing pain in the hands and feet:\nPound fresh ginger into a paste, mix with flour, stir-fry until hot, and consume. Adding scallion whites enhances the effect.\n\nFor foreign objects lodged in the eye:\nGrind high-quality ink with clear water and apply a drop to the corner of the eye—the object will come out.\n\nFor ears discharging pus or fluid:\nBlow powdered raw *baifan* (alum) into the ear three times a day for immediate effect.\n\nFor needles, iron, bamboo, or wood splinters lodged in the flesh:\nGrind ten or more pieces of dried sheep droppings into powder, mix with water, and apply thickly to the affected area. The pain will cease, and the splinter will emerge on its own. Another method: chew the yellow part of a chestnut and apply. Another remedy for bamboo or wood splinters: grind black soybeans into a paste, mix with water, and apply. Another method: grind *bimazi* (castor bean) kernels into a paste. First place a piece of silk over the wound, then apply the medicine, checking frequently. When the splinter emerges, remove the medicine to avoid damaging healthy flesh. Adding *baimei* (dried plum) flesh and grinding together before application is also effective.\n\nFor chapped hands and feet in winter:\nMix *baiji* (bletilla) powder with water and fill the cracks. Avoid contact with water for three to five days.\n\nFor frostbite on the heels in cold weather:\nOn the fifth day of the fifth lunar month at noon, rub the affected area with ginger, scallions, and mugwort for about an hour—it will never recur.\n\nFor toothache:\nDecoct a handful of *qinghao* (sweet wormwood) in a bowl of water until half remains. Rinse the mouth with the warm liquid to stop the pain. Another remedy: grind *liangjiang* (galangal) and *caowu* (wild aconite) into powder and rub it on the teeth. Spit out any saliva—do not swallow. After spitting, rinse the mouth with salt water. Another remedy: for tooth decay or wind-induced toothache, take appropriate medicine based on whether the condition is yin, yang, deficient, or excess. In spring, use *Zhengqi San* (Rectify Qi Powder); in summer, add *dahuang* (rhubarb) and *zhiqiao* (bitter orange peel) to *Baidusan* (Antiphlogistic Powder); in autumn and winter, use *Wujisan* (Five Accumulations Powder) or *Xiaofeng San* (Eliminate Wind Powder). To eliminate parasitic accumulations: grind *binglang* (areca nut) into powder, mix with honey water, and take on an empty stomach. Have the patient eat lightly the day before, skip dinner, and take the medicine at dawn the next day.\n\nFor palm abscesses:\nPound fresh mulberry leaves into a paste and wrap the affected area for healing.\n\n*Xianchuan Waike Mifang*, Volume Ten, Concluded\n*Variant notes: #1 \"Gan\" (干) in the original is written as \"Qian\" (千) in the manuscript. #2 The character \"二\" is absent in the manuscript. #3 After \"染,\" the manuscript includes the character \"淀.\" #4 \"脓\" was originally written as \"浓,\" corrected per the manuscript. #5 \"筋\" is suspected to be a miswriting of \"箸.\" #6 \"汁\" in the manuscript is written as \"汗.\" #7 The missing character in the original is \"皆\" in the manuscript. #8 \"羊\" is suspected to be a miswriting of \"王.\"*\n\n*Xianchuan Waike Mifang*, Volume Eleven\nCompiled by Zhaoyi Yuanyangzi of Junyi",

For dry sores, mix with clear oil and apply.\n\n**For Pox-Related Eye Afflictions in Children**\nGrind *Gujingcao* (谷精草) into powder and administer with white persimmon, pig liver, or malt sugar.\n\n**Shengxi Fuming San (生犀复明散)**, for various eye disorders:\n*Red peony root* (赤芍药) 2 liang, *Scutellaria* (黄芩) 1 liang, *Akebia stem* (木通) 2 liang, *Mulberry root bark* (桑白皮) 2 liang, *Gentian* (龙胆草) 2 liang, *Saposhnikovia* (防风) 2 liang, *Notopterygium* (羌活) 2 liang, *Tangkuei tails* (当归尾) 2 liang, *Rhubarb* (大黄) 8 qian, *Bitter orange peel* (枳壳, with the inner membrane removed) 6 qian.\nCrush the ingredients, and for each dose, take 5 qian with 1.5 cups of water. Add a small amount of fresh mulberry root bark and decoct to 80% of the original volume. Administer after meals. For red eyes with thick obstructions, add raw clam powder; for painful swelling, add raw rehmannia for efficacy.\n\n**Eye Drops**\nWash *Huanglian* (宣黄连) thoroughly, chop, and decoct in a ceramic vessel until reduced by half. Strain the liquid, place it in a ceramic bowl over a steamer, and evaporate until the liquid is minimal. Add a small amount of borneol, store in a clean container or horn tube, and apply to the eyes. It is also effective for festering canthi. When preparing the medicine, strain through fine silk to ensure no dust or debris remains.\n\n**For Sudden Redness and Festering Canthi**\n*Huanglian* (黄连) 5 qian, *Tangkuei tails* (当归尾) 3 qian, *Mirabilite* (朴消) 3 qian, *Apricot kernel* (板杏) 2 qian, *Huangbai* (黄柏) 2 qian, *Teasel root* (川续断) 1 qian.\nCrush the ingredients, place in a bowl over a steamer, and steam thoroughly. While hot, dip and apply the juice to the eyes.\n\nAnother method for red eyes and dim, painful vision: Keep the eyes tightly closed, scoop hot water with the hands, and pour it over the eyes. Stop when the water cools. Repeat frequently—relief lies in keeping the eyes closed.\n\n**For Obstructions and Films in the Eyes**\nDissolve 10 liang of pure *Mirabilite* (朴消) in hot water, strain through a bamboo basket lined with fine paper, and collect in a ceramic bowl. Heat over charcoal until dry, then place on the ground overnight. Add 2 liang of processed *Yellow Lead* (黄丹) and half a qian of musk, grind finely, sift through silk, and add borneol. Apply to the eyes.\n\n**Fumigation for Sudden Red Eyes**\nDecoct *Bohe* (薄荷), *Jingjie* (荆芥), and *Fangfeng* (防风) in a ceramic pot. Fumigate the eyes with the hot vapor, then wash with the hands.\n\n**Huangu Dan (换骨丹)**, for wind-dampness, lumbar, and leg disorders:\nGrind 6 liang of *Cao Wu* (草乌, slightly removing the skin and tips) into powder. Mix with 2 liang of fresh tofu to form cakes, boil in water until they float, then remove. The boiling must be precise—overcooking weakens the medicine, while undercooking makes it too potent. Soak 3 liang of *Cang Zhu* (苍术) in rice-washed water, dry over a fire, and add 1 liang of pure *Tianma* (天麻) and half a liang of washed and lightly fried *Quan Xie* (全蝎). Grind these with the *Cao Wu* cakes into powder, form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds using rice paste. In the evening, avoid eating; before bed, chew *Mugua* (木瓜) and take twenty pills with warm wine. When the medicine permeates the body and feet by midnight, a numbing sensation indicates its efficacy.\n\n**Shujin San (舒筋散)**, for blood stasis, muscle spasms, joint pain, and difficulty walking—this is the foremost formula for invigorating blood and transforming qi:\n*Corydalis* (玄胡索), *Tangkuei* (当归), *Cinnamon bark* (官桂).\nGrind equal parts into powder. Take 2 qian per dose with warm wine on an empty stomach.",

      "translated_text": "**Huoluo Dan (活络丹)**, for all ailments of the waist and legs:\nFour liang of *Huluba* (胡芦巴); two liang stir-fried with four liang of *Haijinsha* (海金沙) until the latter is spent, and two liang stir-fried with four liang of *Badou* (巴豆) until red. *Haijinsha* is commonly called \"bamboo garden dung\"; gather it in the eighth or ninth month, wrap it in paper-lined baskets, dry in the sun, then tap with bamboo to dislodge the seeds, discarding the leaves. (Beware of counterfeits sold by merchants—use only whole *Badou*, shelled.) Four liang of *Cang’ercao* (苍耳草), dried over fire (commonly called \"wild eggplant leaf\"; in the *Bencao*, it is *Xi’er*). Four liang of *Zuochanteng* (左缠藤), leaves and all, dried over fire.\nGrind the three ingredients into powder, form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds using a paste of fine wine and wheat flour. Swallow thirty to forty pills with unheated wine. For waist ailments, take while half-hungry; for knee and leg ailments, take on an empty stomach.\n\n**Plaster Formula for All Sores:**\nBoil one jin of clear oil with two liang of human hair until melted. Add, as desired, half a liang each of *Gancao* nodes (甘草节), *Danggui* tails (当归尾), *Huanglian* (黄连), *Badou* (巴豆), *Bimazi* (蓖麻子), *Huangualou* (黄瓜篓), and *Mubiezi* (木鳖子). Boil twice, strain, then add five liang of *shuifen* (水粉). Boil again until bubbling, then add seven liang of *Huangdan* (黄丹). Boil once more until bubbling, then add one liang of *Ruxiang* powder (乳香末). Stir constantly with peach and willow twigs until droplets form pearls in water and do not stick to the hand—then the plaster is ready.\n\n**Alternative Plaster Formula:**\nBoil five liang of sesame oil with twenty-eight *Badou* (巴豆) and twenty-eight cun of willow twigs until the *Badou* turns black. Strain, then gradually add two liang of *Gudan* (谷丹), stirring constantly with willow twigs. When droplets form unbroken beads in water and do not stick to the hand, remove from heat. Blend in one qian of *Ruxiang* powder, store in a ceramic vessel, and apply once cooled.\n\n**Shen Shou Xiang Su San (神授香苏散)**, for seasonal epidemics:\nAs the formula’s preface states: Once, during a great plague in the city, a white-haired elder taught a wealthy household to prepare and distribute this remedy, curing all the afflicted. Later, plague ghosts questioned the household, and when told the truth, they exclaimed, \"This elder has saved three cities!\"—then bowed and departed. Those who take this medicine must abstain from meat, fish, wine, and rich foods; none will fail to recover.\n\nDuring the former Yuan dynasty, a severe epidemic struck Taihe County in Jian, Jiangxi. A physician returning from house calls late at night suddenly encountered a divine figure on horseback with an entourage. Sensing the figure was no mortal, the physician prostrated himself. The deity halted and demanded, \"Who are you?\" The physician replied, \"I am a physician.\" The deity asked, \"What medicines do you use to treat illness?\" The physician answered, \"I adjust formulas based on the patient’s cold, heat, and severity.\" The deity said, \"That is not so. For all cases, *Xiang Su San* is best.\" The physician returned home and, the next day, followed the deity’s instructions—all were cured. His medical practice flourished, bringing him lifelong fortune and reverence for the deity. This account is recorded here.\n\n*Xiangfuzi* (香附子), stir-fried to remove fuzz—four liang\n*Purple perilla leaves* (紫苏叶)—four liang\n*Chenpi* (陈皮)—one liang\n*Gancao* (甘草), roasted—one liang\nChop coarsely, grind into powder. For each dose, steep three qian in one cup of water, decoct to seven parts, strain, and take warm at any time, three times daily.\n\n**Xian Fang San Bu Wan (仙方三补丸)**, a supreme supplement for all deficiencies and debilities, effective for young and old alike:\nTwo liang of *Poguzhi* (破故纸), stir-fried between paper until fragrant and cooked\nOne liang of *Baifuling* (白茯苓), peeled\nOne liang of *Moyao* (没药), steeped in ash-free wine\nWhen the wine has dissolved the *Moyao* to a syrup-like consistency, grind the first two ingredients into powder, form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds using the medicated wine paste. Take twenty to thirty pills on an empty stomach with warm water.\n\nThe *Xian Fang* states: Once, a man who took this medicine retained a youthful appearance into old age. *Poguzhi* supplements the kidneys, *Fuling* nourishes the heart, and *Moyao* nourishes the blood. When these three are robust, the body naturally thrives.\n\n**For Jaundice from Wine (酒疸脾黄):**\nGrind *Mubiezi* (木鳖子) with vinegar and take one or two cups—relief will follow.\n\n**For Unstoppable Night Sweats:**\nFill the navel with *Wubeizi* (五倍子) powder mixed with saliva, bind with a cloth, and leave overnight—sweating will cease.\n\n**For Genital Sweating:**\nWash *Huangqi* (绵黄芪), slice thinly, place in a pot, and stir-fry with wine until dry and brittle. Grind into powder and take with boiled pig’s heart—marvelously effective.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nGrind equal parts *Shechuangzi* (蛇床子) and *Shichangpu* (石菖蒲) into powder and apply two or three times daily.\n\n**For Acne (痤疿):**\nCut a fresh cucumber and rub the affected area, or bathe with a decoction of jujube leaves.\n\n**Alternative Formula:**\nMix four liang of *Yuyingfen* (玉英粉) and *Zhenbangfen* (真蚌粉) with one liang of *Huashi* (滑石) and two liang of *Lüdoufen* (绿豆粉), then apply the powder dry.\n\n**For □□ (gagging):**\nUse *Bimazi* (蓖麻子) as needed—remove the coarse shells, stir-fry until cooked. Eat the sweet ones; spit out the bitter ones. Eating more brings quicker results.\n\n**For Sudden Tongue Swelling Protruding from the Mouth (due to centipede venom):**\nCut the comb of a rooster, collect the blood in a ceramic dish, and immerse the tongue in it—swallowing will cause the tongue to retract.\n\n**For Delirium, Seeing Ghosts, or Madness:**\nAdd *Chensha* powder (辰砂末) to *Pingwei San* (平胃散) and take with jujube decoction.\n\n**For Chronic \"Pig Cold Wind\" Syndrome (猪寒风证), *Rusheng San* (如圣散) is effective for men and women of any age:**\nEqual parts of:\n*Weilingxian* (威灵仙)\n*Fangfeng* (防风)\n*Jingjie* (荆芥)\n*Fangji* (防己)\n*Mahuang* (麻黄)\n*Xingren* (杏仁)\n*Xixin* (细辛)\n*Chuanxiong* (川芎)\n*Baizhi* (白芷)\nChop, then decoct with three slices of ginger in fine wine and take warm at the onset of symptoms.

The disease’s causes spread through the channels and network vessels, transmit to the viscera and bowels, emerge in the four limbs, and steam both internally and externally, forming blistering ringworm.\n\nThe origins of this illness comprise three syndromes and five mortal stages. The first syndrome is Water Wind; the second, Transmission and Transformation; the third, self-neglect through lack of regulation. The five mortal stages are: first, Skin Death—numbness and loss of sensation; second, Flesh Death—insensitivity to cutting; third, Blood Death—festering and suppuration; fourth, Sinew Death—shedding of hands and feet; fifth, Bone Death—collapse of the nasal bridge, loss of eyes, eversion of lips, leading to loss of voice, beyond all remedy.\n\nThe Five Winds are: first, Wind afflicting the Lung Channel, where the eyebrows fall first; second, Wind afflicting the Liver Channel, where the face erupts in purple blisters; third, Wind afflicting the Kidney Channel, where the soles of the feet perforate first; fourth, Wind afflicting the Spleen Channel, where the entire body becomes scaly like ringworm; fifth, Wind afflicting the Heart Channel, where the eyes are first damaged.\n\nSome cases arise from ancestral gravesites or residences, transmitted in succession among parents, spouses, or household members. Others stem from carelessness outside—latrines, bedchambers, bedding, clothing, or resting beneath bridges or trees—where fate aligns with baleful stars, and one contracts this vile malady, mired in its filth. The manifestations vary, the suffering unbearable, and those who seek treatment often find no relief. Some die within a year or half a year.\n\nIn all cases of this affliction, early intervention is essential for ease of cure. One must carefully examine and distinguish the conditions, for if treatment errs even slightly, the consequences may be as vast as the difference between a hair’s breadth and a thousand miles. Alas, even skilled physicians and learned scholars often recoil from its repulsiveness and pay it little heed.",

      "translated_text": "Some unlearned individuals recklessly pass down their techniques, wielding blades and needles to draw blood at will, burning arsenic or moxa to fumigate and induce salivation, or applying toxic herbs steeped in oil to the body. Those who submit to such treatments find no efficacy in a hundred cases. Even if there is slight temporary relief, the affliction recurs over time, and without encountering a superior formula or wondrous medicine, the patient may ultimately die of the disease.\n\nWhen seeking medical treatment, one must first reside in a quiet chamber, abstain from alcohol and sexual activity, purify the mind and cleanse the heart, and sincerely repent before the divine physician. Additionally, one must avoid exposure to wind and the stirring of qi, as well as refrain from consuming meat, fish, salt, fermented sauces, raw or cold foods. Patience and composure are essential. Only then may one take various medicines, adjusting dosages as needed, preparing pills and powders, and administering them according to the prescribed method—thereby ensuring a cure without fail.\n\nFirst, administer purgative pills to expel foul blood. If pus or festering sores are present, use medicinal washes for fumigation and cleansing. Within ten days, healthy flesh will emerge. Old sores will gradually recede and cease to erupt, the ears and nose will regain their openness, the skin will feel refreshed, eyebrows and beard will regrow, the complexion will become radiant, and the five viscera will be harmonized. The efficacy of these treatments defies full description.\n\nThe formulas are as follows:\n\n**Disperse Wind Powder (Day 1)**\n*Fragrant Angelica (1 tael), Scorpion (1 tael, tips removed), Ginseng (1 tael)*\nGrind into powder. Take two mace each dose at noon, consuming only congee. Avoid ginger, pepper, and all heating substances. Refrain from eating supper. The next morning, take the powder on an empty stomach, mixed with warm wine, and delay breakfast. Mild dryness of the skin is desirable.\n\n**Expel Wind Powder (Purgative for Blood, Day 2)**\n*Rhubarb (6 taels), Sichuan Curcuma (1.8 taels, smaller roots preferred), Gleditsia Thorn (1 tael)*\nGrind into powder. Begin with a dose of six, seven, or five mace, adding two and a half mace of *Da Feng* oil, a small amount of refined mirabilite, and mix with a bowl of well-brewed wine (not hot, but lukewarm). Do not eat congee in the evening. Wait until the *Xu* hour (7–9 p.m.), place a bowl of warm water in a basin on the table, and add a small amount of sugar or honey decoction to a plate—ensuring the patient does not see the medicine beforehand. After taking the medicine, have the patient rinse their mouth with water, then sweeten it with the honey decoction. They must not lie down; instead, have someone accompany them while sitting for a long while. Severe abdominal pain is most desirable, and purging ten or more times is unproblematic. Afterward, consume thin congee to restore strength.\n\nThis purgative is generally unsuitable for the elderly or weak; those under fifty may be treated. For the robust, administer three doses within ten days: on the first day, *Disperse Wind Powder*; the second day, *Expel Wind Powder*; the third day, *Grind Wind Pill*; the fourth day, *Disperse Wind Powder* again; the fifth day, *Expel Wind Powder*; and the sixth day, *Grind Wind Pill*. For the frail, administer one dose within ten days. Once some improvement is seen, follow the regimen for the robust, taking one dose every ten days after two months. Carefully note the days.\n\n**Grind Wind Pill (Day 3, two doses daily)**\n*Sichuan Angelica, Notopterygium, Pubescent Angelica, Sichuan Lovage (smaller roots), Gastrodia, Asarum, Saposhnikovia, Schizonepeta, Clematis, Ephedra (nodes removed), Fleeceflower Root, Tribulus, Arctium, Toad Leaf, Cocklebur, Ground Pine*\nSixteen ingredients, each one tael. Dry in the sun, grind into powder (avoid fire), and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds using wine-cooked rice paste. Take thirty pills per dose, before or after meals, twice daily.\n\n**Wash Formula**\n*Lycium Bark, Schizonepeta, Sophora, Asarum (3 taels each)*\nChop and mix evenly. Use two taels per wash, decocted in river water. Fumigate and wash the entire body; bleeding indicates efficacy. For washing, use a large tub or vat with ample water to fully immerse the body for an extended period.\n\n**Topical Application (Day 4, for severe festering sores)**\n*Eucommia (2 taels, firm), Sulfur (6 mace), Calcined Alum (2 taels), Cnidium (4 taels), Calcite (2 taels), a small amount of Mirabilite*\nGrind into fine powder and mix with lard or sesame oil for application. If sores are not festering, washing is unnecessary.\n\n**Supplementary Formula (from alternate texts) for all wind afflictions, numbness of flesh, itchy skin, scabies, leprosy, ringworm, various sores, rashes, facial wind resembling crawling insects, purple or white patches, or kidney wind attacking the legs and feet causing sores—all may be treated with this.**\n*Shiny Dark Plant (2 taels), Angelica (1 tael), Fleeceflower Root (3 taels), Angelica (2 taels), Sophora (2 taels), Clematis (2 taels, rhizomes removed), Tribulus (1.5 taels), Pubescent Angelica (1 tael), Lovage (1 tael), Saposhnikovia (2 taels), Schizonepeta (2 taels), Notopterygium (1 tael), Red Peony (1 tael), Tribulus (1 tael, stir-fried), Earthworm (3 taels, soil removed), Typhonium (1 tael), Gardenia (1 tael), Black-Striped Snake (1, soaked in good wine, steamed until dry, bones removed, flesh dried or baked)*\nGrind the above into powder, then add:\n*Sesame (2 taels, stir-fried), Chaulmoogra (3 taels, shelled)*\nGrind these two together, mix with the previous powder, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds using wine-cooked rice paste. Take thirty to forty pills per dose, with tea or wine.\n\n**Additional Formula**\n*Clematis, Fleeceflower Root, Ground Pine, Saposhnikovia, Tribulus, Schizonepeta, Toad Leaf, Asarum, Arctium, Gleditsia Thorn, Angelica, Cocklebur, Gastrodia, Licorice (honey-fried), Notopterygium, Pubescent Angelica, Ephedra (nodes removed), Bugleweed, Sichuan Lovage, Sophora*",

Take forty to fifty pills per dose, with tea or wine as preferred.\n\n**Additional Formula for Regrowing Eyebrows**\nRoast Gleditsia Thorn until dry and char Deer Antler to preserve its nature, each in equal parts.

Eyebrows will naturally regrow.\n\n**Moxibustion Method for Radical Cure**\nAt the crease between the tendon and bone of the big toe, and at the joints of the fingers—approximately half an inch in length—moxa each point three times to expel toxic qi.\n\n*End of Scroll Eleven, Esoteric Formulas of the Immortal’s External Medicine*\n\n**Appendix: The Power of Convenience in Action**\nIn this world, convenience is paramount; when strength permits, act without delay, for missed opportunities are to be regretted. Those with wealth and power wield immense influence over others’ fortunes. In all matters, let convenience guide your heart: grant one measure of leniency, and others receive one measure of blessing. Go further—perform good deeds of every kind without pause. Emulate the sages who sought to benefit all under heaven; no greater merit exists.\n\n**First among great conveniences is the equitable sale of grain.**\nThe Celestial Master Zhang of Han taught that the foremost merit lies in saving lives. Those with means should, at harvest time, purchase grain in abundance—or store their own surplus—and release it at the original price during shortages. This costs them nothing yet brings immense benefit to others. The late Huang Chengshi of Chengdu practiced this and was honored by the Purple Palace Perfected Lord Zhang; he ascended to immortality, and his family enjoyed prosperity for generations. Even better is to sell grain at a reduced price during times of scarcity.\n\n**Second is the relief of illness—a great convenience.**\nThose who devoutly prepare and distribute the *Ruyi Elixir* of Perfected Lord Xu can cure myriad diseases, especially epidemics. Other efficacious remedies are also commendable, as is the printing and distribution of proven formulas.\n\n**Third, in summer, provide cool water; in winter, offer clothing to the elderly and infirm.**\nCare for widows, orphans, the childless, and the solitary. Foster abandoned children. Provide coffins for the unburied. Aid those in sudden distress or dire need as circumstances allow.\n\n**Fourth, deliverance of the departed is a small effort with vast merit.**\nMaster Ge ascended through this practice, and Perfected Lady Sa likewise attained immortality. All past immortals and masters prioritized this; those who regularly perform sacrificial refinement bring blessings to the departed. Even offering a single meal confers no small benefit.\n\n**Enlightened individuals and upright scholars** delve deeply, seeking to comprehend the illusory nature of life and destiny and to master the alchemy of water and fire. They not only transcend the mundane but also deliver the departed. Merit and virtue begin here, but one must seek a teacher’s guidance to avoid squandering the opportunity.\n\n**Fifth, all living beings share the capacity for suffering.**\nWhere possible, refrain from killing. Treat insects, birds, and beasts with the same compassion. Daoist scriptures prescribe fasting and releasing life on the Three Officials’ festivals, for on the Three Primes, fasting is judged by one’s abstention from taking life.\n\n**Sixth, build bridges, repair roads, dig wells, clear channels, promote benefit, eliminate harm, encourage virtue, resolve doubts, mediate disputes, and end conflicts—all are acts of convenience.**\nFor the wealthy and powerful, such deeds reach many, ensuring abundant rewards, augmented fortune and longevity, and blessings for descendants. For Daoist practitioners, they fulfill both merit and practice, naturally attracting a teacher and achieving enlightenment. Even those of modest means who act thus perform a difficult task.\n\nAs the Reclusive Perfected One once said: \"Of old, those who performed meritorious deeds could save a ruined world. The wealthy find it easy to do good, while the poor struggle to follow suit. Yet those who act from a place of difficulty earn merit a hundredfold greater than the wealthy.\"\n\n**Mirror for Preserving Life in Newly Recovered Cases of Febrile Disease and Heat-Induced Convulsions**\n*Recorded by the Preserver of Vitality, Daoist of Ningchuan*\n\n**Taboos for Epidemics**\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* asks: \"After recovering from febrile disease, why do some suffer relapses?\"\nQibo replies: \"Eating meat causes recurrence; overeating leads to lingering illness. Lingering illness arises when, despite intense heat, one forces food, allowing heat to lodge within. When grain qi interacts with it, the two heats combine, causing relapse—termed *food relapse*.\"\nWang Qixuan explains: \"When residual heat remains, it spreads throughout the body. *Recurrence* means the illness returns.\"\nAfter recovering from heat disease, if blood and qi have not stabilized and residual heat persists, premature exertion causes *overstrain relapse*.\n\nZhang Zhongjing’s *Treatise on Cold Damage* and Cheng Wuji’s commentary state: \"If a man has recently recovered but not fully, and a woman lies with him, it is called *yang exchange*. If a woman has recently recovered but not fully, and a man lies with her, it is called *yin exchange*. The interaction of yin and yang stirs residual toxins, which infect like an exchange.\"\n*Sexual relapse* refers to self-induced arousal; it is also called *female overstrain relapse*. Internal depletion of true qi and external stirring of pathogenic heat leave true qi deficient and evil qi flourishing—rendering it incurable. The late Gu Zixian, though recovered, did not heed Hua Tuo’s warnings. On his deathbed, his tongue protruded several inches—a cautionary tale.\n\n**External Causes of Overstrain Relapse**\n- Combing hair too early invites head wind.\n- Washing the face too early causes head heat.\n- Washing the feet too early leads to foot numbness.\n- Bathing too early induces fever and dizziness.\n- Anger breeds stagnation.\n- Long journeys weaken the legs, causing flaccid wind.\n- Overexertion leads to hemiplegia.\n- Anxiety depletes qi.\n- Rising too early or straining the mind and body risks relapse.\n\n**Internal Causes of Food Relapse**\n- Eating mutton causes wheezing, suffocation, and death.\n- Eating sheep’s heart or lungs risks fatal relapse.\n- Eating sheep’s blood or liver causes severe diarrhea.\n- Eating beef leads to intractable dysentery.\n- Eating sheep or pig intestines causes chronic illness.\n- Eating horse meat is lethal.\n- Eating poultry too soon is lethal.",

Purgative medicines must then be administered, but excessive diarrhea will be uncontrollable; without purgation, death is inevitable. Even if purged, recovery remains precarious, and all cases are difficult to save.\n\nWithin a hundred days of convalescence, when qi and strength have not yet fully returned, engaging in sexual activity is fatal.

Avoid satiety, and refrain from all other foods—even if cravings arise, do not indulge them.\n\nFor post-illness thirst, *Tianshui Powder* is recommended.

      "translated_text": "Now I observe that among the vulgar and ignorant, some rely on their innate robust constitution, while others suffer only mild afflictions. Though they may fortuitously recover without relapse, they take this as the norm and are misled by the masses. Little do they know that one’s endowment of qi waxes and wanes, and the severity of illness varies—yet they recklessly generalize, and thus countless perish needlessly. There are also mothers who dote on their children, or wives who cherish their husbands, and when they beg for food, these women secretly indulge them. They disregard the gravity of life and death, valuing only the fleeting pleasure of the palate—only to bring harm upon those they love.\n\nAlas, such truths may be shared with the discerning, but are difficult to convey to the common folk. Thus, the wise must exercise utmost caution. Having distilled the wisdom of sages and worthies from their collected works, I have compiled these prohibitions and dietary laws, entitling them *The Mirror for Preserving Life*.\n\nFor infants with smallpox or measles, the following ten perils must also be avoided during the \"silkworm month\":\n- The foul odor of armpit fox-musk\n- The noxious vapors of ditches and filthy drains\n- The turbid, lustful qi of the bedchamber (especially after recent intercourse)\n- The menstrual qi of women, along with all manner of bloody, rank odors\n- The fumes of alcohol and the stench of meat or fish (inhaling the breath of a drunkard may drive pox toxins inward; if the child drinks wine, the toxins will erupt outward)\n- The fumes of sulfur-based mosquito repellents and other toxic substances (if one with red eyes is exposed, the pain will be severe and recovery difficult)\n- The restless, impure qi of musk (inhaling musk may draw pox toxins inward)\n- The steam and dampness of epidemic sweat (keep coriander nearby on all sides to counteract its effects)\n- The acrid smoke of burning hair, fish bones, or other foul odors, as well as wood smoke entering the mouth and nose\n- The pungent vapors of onions, garlic, leeks, and chives, along with the greasy fumes of frying oil\n\nThe above prohibitions are drawn from *The Complete Collection for Infant Care*; none may be violated, lest complications arise—this I have witnessed firsthand.\n\nSome may argue that rural children, left to their natural state, suffer no ill effects from such transgressions. Yet this overlooks the distinction between noble and base, and the differences in innate endowment.\n\n**Coriander Wine** is used to promote the eruption of smallpox in children. Take three liang of finely chopped coriander, steep it in two large cups of wine, and bring to a boil. Immediately cover to trap the vapors, then allow to cool. Strain and lightly spray the child’s nape, back, chest, abdomen, and feet—avoiding the head and face. Place the leftover coriander in a pouch and hang it in the bed canopy. The remaining wine may be consumed by the wet nurse.\n\n*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: There are six conditions under which illness cannot be cured. The first is arrogance and self-indulgence, refusing to heed reason.",

Mix with natural onion juice and apply to the temples and above the eyebrows. Avoid contact with the eyes. After application, avoid wind. Apply only to the areas of headache.\n\n**Supplementing the Liver and Enhancing Clarity Pill**\n- Antelope horn (*Lingyangjiao*): 1 *liang*\n- Fresh rehmannia (*Shengdihuang*): 1 *liang*\n- Prepared rehmannia (*Shudihuang*): 1 *liang*\n- Cistanche (*Roucongrong*): 1 *liang*\n- Lycium fruit (*Gouqizi*): 1 *liang*\n- Ledebouriella (*Fangfeng*): 1 *liang*\n- Cassia seed (*Caojueming*): 1 *liang*\n- Paper mulberry fruit (*Chushizi*): 0.5 *liang*\n- Chrysanthemum (*Ganjuhua*): 1 *liang*\n- Notopterygium (*Qianghuo*): 1 *liang*\n- Chinese angelica (*Danggui*): 1 *liang*\n- Sheep liver (*Yangzigan*): 4 *liang* (boiled and dried)\n\nGrind into powder, form into honey pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take thirty pills per dose.\n\nGenerally, the liver governs the eyes; the liver receives blood and thus enables vision. If blood is weak, the liver’s *qi* lacks nourishment, and if the liver’s *qi* is not flourishing, the gallbladder’s fluid cannot ascend. This leads to blurred vision, weak eyesight, and unclear perception in children. This formula greatly supplements liver blood, enriches gallbladder fluid, and resolves hidden obstructions in the eyes.\n\nTake on an empty stomach with salted water to guide the formula downward. At midday, take with tea to clear the head and eyes. Before sleep, take with wine to nourish liver blood. For those who do not drink, take with a decoction of ginseng and Chinese angelica. Prolonged use yields excellent results.\n\n**For All Kinds of Red Eyes and Head-Wind with Redness, Swelling, and Inability to Open the Eyes**\nFor pain from blows to the temples, this application is most effective.\n- Pig tusk *zaojiao* (Gleditsia sinensis)\n- Phellodendron (*Huangbo*)\n- Turmeric (*Jianghuang*)\n- Arisaema (*Nanxing*)\n- Wild aconite (*Cao Wu*)\n- Coptis (*Huangliang*)\n\nGrind into powder, mix with natural ginger juice, and apply to the temples. Pain ceases after one or two applications. For red obstructions, this application is also suitable. For traumatic injury with redness, swelling, and inability to open the eyes, add *furong* (hibiscus) and mung bean powder, then apply. Applying mashed onion is also effective.\n\n**Washing Formula for Various Eye Conditions**\n- Coptis (*Huangliang*)\n- Chinese angelica (*Danggui*)\n- Red peony (*Chishaoyao*)\n- Talcum (*Huashi*)\n\nGrind into powder, steep in hot water, and let settle. Use the clear liquid to wash all kinds of corneal obstructions. Add gypsum (*Shigao*), frankincense (*Ruxiang*), and *Qinpi* (ash bark).

      "translated_text": "**Appendix: On Exerting Effort to Practice Convenience**\n\nIn this world, convenience is foremost; where strength suffices, act without delay—regret follows hesitation.\n\nFor those of wealth, nobility, and power, the sway of fortune and misfortune over others is effortless. When facing matters, let convenience guide the heart: granting one measure of leniency bestows one measure of blessing upon others. Further, exert oneself in good deeds, practicing every form of convenience without pause. People will revere such virtue as that of sages who benefit all under heaven—no merit surpasses this.\n\n**1. Selling Grain at Fair Prices is the Greatest Convenience.**\nThe Celestial Master Han Ancestor taught that the foremost merit lies in saving others. Those with wealth, upon harvest, should broadly purchase and store grain, or if possessing fields, accumulate reserves. When scarcity arises, sell at the original price—no loss to oneself, yet immense benefit to others. Formerly, Huang Chengshi of Chengdu practiced this and was honored by the Purple Mansion Perfected Lord, Minister Zhang. He ascended to the immortal registers and enjoyed prosperity for generations. Alternatively, selling at a reduced price during lean times is even more commendable.\n\n**2. Relieving Illness is a Great Convenience.**\nIf one can devoutly prepare and distribute the *Ruyi Elixir* of the Perfected Lord Xu, it cures myriad ailments, especially swift in treating epidemics. Other efficacious medicines for distribution are also excellent, as is printing and disseminating proven remedies.\n\n**3. In summer, distribute water; in winter, provide clothing for the elderly and infirm. Show compassion to widows, orphans, the childless, and the solitary. Foster abandoned children. Supply coffins to the unburied. Relieve those in urgent distress or poverty as circumstances allow.**\n\n**4. Deliverance of the Deceased is of Small Cost but Great Merit.**\nMaster Ge the Immortal and Perfected Lord Sa attained transcendence through this, and all past immortals and masters have emphasized it. If one consistently performs sacrificial refinement, blessings extend to the departed. Even occasional fasting and food offerings confer no small benefit.\n\nEnlightened individuals and upright scholars, through exhaustive study and inquiry, awaken to the illusory nature of life and destiny and master the Dao of reversing water and fire. Not only do they transcend the mundane, but they also deliver the departed from the netherworld. The accumulation of deeds and merits begins here—one must seek a master’s guidance to avoid squandering effort.\n\n**5. The Suffering of Living Beings is Shared with Humans.**\nWhere possible, refrain from killing. Treat insects, birds, and beasts with equal compassion. The scriptures prescribe fasting and releasing life on the Three Officials’ days, for the Three Primes’ assessments deem all fasting as abstention from taking life.\n\n**6. Repairing bridges, mending roads, digging wells, clearing channels, promoting benefit, eliminating harm, exhorting goodness, resolving doubts, mediating disputes—all are acts of convenience.**\n\nFor the wealthy who practice such conveniences, their reach is vast, and their recompense abundant. Blessings and longevity increase, and their families enjoy lasting felicity. For Dao cultivators, this ensures both merit and practice are fulfilled, naturally encountering masters and attaining the Dao. For those of modest means, such deeds are especially difficult. As the Pure Nourishment Perfected One once said: *\"Of old, those who performed meritorious deeds could succor the world’s destitute. The wealthy find it easy to act, while the poor find it hard to emulate. Yet those who act where emulation is difficult achieve merit a hundredfold greater than the wealthy.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Mirror for Preserving Life in Newly Recovered Cases of Cold Damage, Febrile Diseases, and Convulsions**\n*Recorded by Ningchuan, the Daoist of Preserving Nurturance*\n\n**Epidemics share the same prohibitions.** The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* asks: *\"After recovering from cold damage or febrile illness, why do some symptoms linger?\"*\nQibo replied: *\"Eating meat causes relapse; overeating causes lingering illness. Lingering occurs when, despite intense heat, one forces food, allowing heat to hide and combine with grain qi. The two heats merge, causing residual symptoms—termed *food relapse*.\"*\nWang Qixuan explained: *\"When heat qi is not fully expelled, it lingers and afflicts the body. Relapse means falling ill again.\"*\n\n**Labor Relapse**\nAfter recent recovery from febrile illness, blood and qi are not yet restored, and residual heat remains. Premature exertion causes *labor relapse*.\n\n**Zhang Zhongjing’s Discussion on Yin-Yang Exchange in Cold Damage (Annotated by Cheng Wuji):**\nIf a man recently recovered but not fully restored engages in intercourse with a woman, the illness is called *yang exchange*. If a woman in the same state engages with a man, it is called *yin exchange*. The mutual stimulation of yin and yang, along with residual toxin transmission, resembles an exchange.\n\n**Sexual Relapse**\nThis refers to self-induced lust, also called *female labor relapse*. It depletes true qi internally and stirs pathogenic heat externally. With genuine deficiency and pathogenic excess, it becomes untreatable. Formerly, Gu Zixian, though recovered, did not heed Hua Fu’s cautions.

Eating white hyacinth beans obstructs cold qi in the chest. Eating mallow causes blindness. Eating raw vegetables leads to fatal heart disease and irreversible complexion. Drinking wine too soon induces manic agitation. Drinking white liquor causes edema.\n\nDuring epidemic outbreaks, after sweating resolves the illness, drinking cold water harms the pericardium, leaving one debilitated and unrecovered. Master Sun’s *Treatise on Formulas* states: After recovering from febrile diseases or major illnesses, eating pork, sheep’s blood, fatty fish, or greasy foods will inevitably cause severe diarrhea, which physicians cannot cure and is fatal. Consuming pastries, glutinous millet, raw fish, roasted meats, malt sugar, crab, dried meats, preserved fruits, jujubes, chestnuts, peaches, apricots, plums, or other hard-to-digest foods—while the stomach qi remains weak and unable to transform them—will necessitate purgative medicine. Uncontrollable diarrhea may follow, and without purgation, death is certain. Even with purgation, recovery is perilous and difficult to save.\n\nBefore one hundred days have passed after recovery, when qi and strength have not yet returned, engaging in sexual activity is lethal; even the robust must abstain for sixty days. After recovery, one should only consume thin rice porridge, eating sparingly to maintain hunger and carefully avoiding satiety. No other foods should be eaten, even if craved. For thirst after sourness, one may take *Tianshui Powder*, or consume watermelon or water pears to quench thirst and dispel residual heat.\n\nHaving practiced medicine for over forty years and treated many patients, I invariably provide these prohibitions and dietary rules to those recovering from febrile illnesses, to prevent relapse.",

      "translated_text": "Herein I observe the ignorant and base among the common folk, who, relying on their innate robust constitutions or having suffered only mild afflictions, deem themselves fortunate to escape relapse and thus take such peril lightly, swayed by the misguided counsel of the multitude. They fail to grasp that one’s endowment of qi may wax or wane, that the severity of illness varies, and that reckless disregard—treating all cases alike—has led countless to their deaths.\n\nSome mothers, out of love for their children, or wives for their husbands, secretly indulge their cravings for food, valuing fleeting gustatory pleasure over life itself, thereby unwittingly hastening harm. Alas, such truths are fit to share with the discerning, yet difficult to impress upon the vulgar—thus must the wise exercise utmost caution.\n\nHaving distilled the wisdom of sages and worthies from their collected works, I have compiled these prohibitions and dietary rules, entitling them *The Mirror for Preserving Life*. The following must also be strictly avoided in cases of infantile pox and eruptive rashes, as well as during the ten perilous months of pregnancy:\n\n- The foul odor of fox-like armpit secretions\n- The noxious vapors of ditches and filthy channels\n- The turbid, lascivious qi of the bedchamber (especially after recent intercourse)\n- The menstrual qi and all manner of bloody, rank odors\n- The fumes of alcohol and the stench of meat or fish (inhaling the breath of a drunkard may drive pox toxin inward; if the child drinks wine, the toxin erupts outward)\n- The acrid vapors of sulfur-based mosquito repellents and other toxic substances (contact with these may cause red, painful eyes that resist healing)\n- The restless, impure qi of musk (inhaling it may draw pox toxin inward)\n- The steam and dampness of epidemic sweat (keep coriander nearby to counteract its miasma)\n- The stench of singed hair, fish bones, or other foul odors, as well as woodsmoke entering the mouth or nose\n- The pungent qi of onions, garlic, and leeks\n- The greasy fumes of frying oil\n\nThe above prohibitions are drawn from *The Complete Compendium for Infants* and must not be violated, lest complications arise—this I have witnessed firsthand.\n\nSome argue that peasant children, left to nature’s course, suffer no ill effects from such transgressions, attributing this to differences in social station and innate endowment. Yet this is not so.\n\nFor infantile pox desiring outward expression, prepare *Coriander Wine*: finely chop three liang of coriander, steep in two large cups of wine, and bring to a boil. Cover tightly to trap the vapors, then cool and strain. Lightly spray the child’s nape, back, chest, abdomen, and feet, avoiding the face and head. Place the lees in a pouch and hang it within the bed-curtains; the nursing mother may consume the remaining decoction.\n\nThe *Records of the Historian* states: \"There are six conditions that render illness incurable. The first is arrogance and self-indulgence, refusing to heed reason...\"",

Take at midday with tea to clear the head and eyes. Take before bed with wine to nourish liver blood.
