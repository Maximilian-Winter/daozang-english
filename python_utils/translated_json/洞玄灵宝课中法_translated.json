From the mortal to the sagely, from beginning to end, one must first receive the register of precepts. Thus, when first ascending to the realm of the perfected, all matters exist in duality, and in duality there is no principle that does not penetrate.\n\nThe register is also called the \"register,\" the wondrous *qi* of the Three Heavens, the names and titles of the divine officials of the ten directions and the immortals, bestowed upon those who practice the Dao. As the scriptures say: \"Those who live without a Daoist rank become lowly ghosts in death.\" Among worldly scholars and eminent persons who aspire to the Dao but cannot yet relinquish worldly glory and emolument, one cannot receive the register all at once at the outset. They may first receive the third or fifth rank, and if their cultivation bears merit, they may then advance to higher ranks.\n\nThe perfected of antiquity, consulting the scriptural records, would receive only one or two ranks for their practice and thereby ascend to the position of the highest perfected. If one receives many ranks but does not cultivate, fails to comprehend the ultimate principle, or does not understand the reasons for practice, it will not benefit the Dao. One must apply the mind with sincerity and align practice with the true Way—then the Dao will unfailingly respond, and its response will be as if divine.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity register was first transmitted into the world in twenty-four ranks, corresponding to the twenty-four vital breaths of life. Here, we briefly elucidate one or two ranks to clarify the origin of Orthodox Unity.\n\nThe register of the One Hundred Fifty Generals of Orthodox Unity’s Three-Five ranks has two levels: the upper is called \"Upper Immortal,\" and the lower is called \"Upper Spirit.\" Both are the true deities of the Two Modes within the human body.\n\nWe further explain the origin of the Orthodox Unity Three-Five Primal Mandate Perfected Person’s Vermilion Register. \"Orthodox Unity\" is the sovereign of all methods, subduing deceit and falsehood to return all to the true Dao. \"Primal Chaos\" refers to the moment when my body first received *qi* at birth, akin to the initial chaos of heaven and earth. \"Primal Mandate\" is the original mandate of my body; one who knows the Dao and cultivates this mandate may become a perfected person. The principles of the Primal Mandate are vast and enduring, and their details are too numerous to record here. At the altar during the transmission of the method, the master must clearly instruct the disciple, enabling them to understand the origin of the Primal Mandate. The principles of the remaining ranks are all elucidated through the body.\n\nAll methods exist in both inner and outer duality. In the heavens, the method of Orthodox Unity’s Alliance of Might is situated within the Celestial Han and Dipper Palace. If we turn inward to the body, the Three Elixir Fields become the Three *Qi*, and the true deities transform into one thousand two hundred forms and ten thousand two thousand radiant spirits. Thus it is said: \"Obtaining the Three *Qi* and knowing the origin of the Six Numbers, the yang *qi* transforms into a dragon chariot, and the yin *qi* becomes a jade maiden, soaring without bound and wheeling through the void above.\"\n\nIt is also said: \"Where *qi* resides, the spirit is born accordingly.\" When the spirit is present, *qi* coalesces; when the spirit departs, *qi* disperses. This *qi* is the true *qi* of the Twenty-Four Deities. *Qi* can become spirit, and spirit can become *qi*. When dispersed, *qi* becomes clouds and mist; when gathered, it forms shapes and shadows. Emerging, it becomes immortal transformation; entering, it becomes the True One. Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it functions as my body; in motion, it functions as my spirit. Thus, the accomplishments and functions of the Dao all reside within my body.\n\nFor those who cultivate and refine, yin *qi* naturally dissipates, and yang *qi* naturally descends. Without yin *qi*, there is naturally no yin above the Nine Heavens; without yang *qi*, there is naturally no yang below the Nine Earths. This is the meaning of Orthodox Unity’s principle, which lies herein.\n\nThe methods of the *Dongxuan Lingbao* liturgical manual are thus concluded.",

      "translated_text": "The register is that which disciplines the emotions and nature through precepts, blocks transgressions and wrongdoing, severs the roots of evil, and gives rise to the Daoist vocation. From the mortal to the sagely, from beginning to end, one must first receive the register of precepts. Thus, when first ascending to the realm of the perfected, all matters exist in duality, and in duality there is no principle that does not penetrate.\n\nThe register is also called the \"register,\" the wondrous *qi* of the Three Heavens, the names and titles of the divine officials of the ten directions and the immortals, bestowed upon those who practice the Dao. As the scriptures say: \"Those who live without a Daoist rank become lowly ghosts in death.\" Among worldly scholars and eminent persons who aspire to the Dao but cannot yet relinquish worldly glory and emolument, one cannot receive the register all at once at the outset. They may first receive the third or fifth rank, and if their cultivation bears merit, they may then advance to higher ranks.\n\nThe perfected of antiquity, consulting the scriptural records, would receive only one or two ranks for their practice and thereby ascend to the position of the highest perfected. If one receives many ranks but does not cultivate, fails to comprehend the ultimate principle, or does not understand the reasons for practice, it will not benefit the Dao. One must apply the mind with sincerity and align practice with the true Way—then the Dao will unfailingly respond, and its response will be as if divine.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity register was first transmitted into the world in twenty-four ranks, corresponding to the twenty-four vital breaths of life. Here, we briefly elucidate one or two ranks to clarify the origin of Orthodox Unity.\n\nThe register of the One Hundred Fifty Generals of Orthodox Unity’s Three-Five ranks has two levels: the upper is called \"Upper Immortal,\" and the lower is called \"Upper Spirit.\" Both are the true deities of the Two Modes within the human body.\n\nWe further explain the origin of the Orthodox Unity Three-Five Primal Mandate Perfected Person’s Vermilion Register. \"Orthodox Unity\" is the sovereign of all methods, subduing deceit and falsehood to return all to the true Dao. \"Primal Chaos\" refers to the moment when my body first received *qi* at birth, akin to the initial chaos of heaven and earth. \"Primal Mandate\" is the original mandate of my body; one who knows the Dao and cultivates this mandate may become a perfected person. The principles of the Primal Mandate are vast and enduring, and their details are too numerous to record here. At the altar during the transmission of the method, the master must clearly instruct the disciple, enabling them to understand the origin of the Primal Mandate. The principles of the remaining ranks are all elucidated through the body.\n\nAll methods exist in both inner and outer duality. In the heavens, the method of Orthodox Unity’s Alliance of Might is situated within the Celestial Han and Dipper Palace. If we turn inward to the body, the Three Elixir Fields become the Three *Qi*, and the true deities transform into one thousand two hundred forms and ten thousand two thousand radiant spirits. Thus it is said: \"Obtaining the Three *Qi* and knowing the origin of the Six Numbers, the yang *qi* transforms into a dragon chariot, and the yin *qi* becomes a jade maiden, soaring without bound and wheeling through the void above.\"\n\nIt is also said: \"Where *qi* resides, the spirit is born accordingly.\" When the spirit is present, *qi* coalesces; when the spirit departs, *qi* disperses. This *qi* is the true *qi* of the Twenty-Four Deities. *Qi* can become spirit, and spirit can become *qi*. When dispersed, *qi* becomes clouds and mist; when gathered, it forms shapes and shadows. Emerging, it becomes immortal transformation; entering, it becomes the True One. Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it functions as my body; in motion, it functions as my spirit. Thus, the accomplishments and functions of the Dao all reside within my body.\n\nFor those who cultivate and refine, yin *qi* naturally dissipates, and yang *qi* naturally descends. Without yin *qi*, there is naturally no yin above the Nine Heavens; without yang *qi*, there is naturally no yang below the Nine Earths. This is the meaning of Orthodox Unity’s principle, which lies herein.\n\nThe methods of the *Dongxuan Lingbao* liturgical manual are thus concluded.",
