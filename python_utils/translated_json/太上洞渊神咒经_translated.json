  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra*\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra*. Author unknown. Twenty scrolls. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavernous Mystery Division, *Benwen* Category.\n\n**Preface to *The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra***\nComposed by Du Guangting, Supreme Perfected of the Celestial Chariot Transmission, Heavenly Master with Special Advancement, Grand Mentor of the Heir Apparent, Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, Grand Academician of the Chongzhen Institute, Pillar of the State, Duke of the Cai Principality of Pengcheng Commandery, Grand Master of Vast Teachings, Feathered Guest of the Golden Gate, Literary Master in Attendance to the Imperial Compositions, Palace Attendant of the Inner Court, Master of the Three Teachings’ Discourses, and Broadly Accomplished Master, enfeoffed with five thousand households and granted an additional one thousand six hundred in true seal, bestowed with the Purple Robe.\n\nAt the close of the Western Jin, the Central Plains fell into chaos, famine pressed hard, and pestilence arose. Wang Zuan, a Daoist of Horse Hoof Mountain in Jintan, had long practiced hidden virtue to succor beings, his benevolence extending even to the lowest creatures. As poisonous miasmas spread at the time, many perished, villages lay desolate, and the dead filled the streets like bedding. In his quiet chamber, Zuan soared petitions to Heaven, weeping through three nights without cease.\n\nBy the third night, a radiance bright as daylight filled the courtyard, and auspicious winds with scenic clouds suffused the heavens. Suddenly, celestial fragrance and heavenly music descended into the courtyard, where over three thousand armored warriors, armed with golden armor and sharp weapons, arrayed themselves as if awaiting command. In but a moment, pearl-encrusted canopies and jeweled banners, rainbow streamers and crimson standards, red flags and embroidered pennants advanced in pairs to receive them, while white cranes soared in flight and vermilion phoenixes danced in unison. Two azure-clad attendants bore flowers and incense, and four jade maidens held aloft a jade table. The earth unfolded into brocade mats, a great screen stood before them, and on either side stood Dragon and Tiger Generals with over twenty attendants and officials, as if in solemn guard. Beyond the Dragon and Tiger Lords, dozens of golden-armored generals and great divine kings arrayed themselves in orderly ranks.\n\nPresently, pipes and flutes resounded through the sky, descending from the northwest, while five-colored lights blazed with dazzling brilliance. One bearing a tablet and girded with a sword stepped forward and announced to Zuan: \"The Supreme Dao Lord has arrived.\" Then a throne of a hundred treasures descended from the void, and there appeared the Dao Lord seated upon a five-colored flying dragon and lotus throne, hovering over ten feet above the ground, attended by two Perfected Ones and two Celestial Masters. Zuan bowed deeply, advancing with reverent steps to receive him.\n\nThe Dao Lord said: \"You have pitied the people, expressing it in your memorials, carving out your heart and weeping tears that have moved both the seen and unseen realms. The earthly officials have reported this, and I have taken note of you.\" Zuan prostrated himself in gratitude.\n\nThe Dao Lord continued: \"The interplay of yin and yang nurtures the myriad things, endowing them with the five phases for their use. Yet the five phases overcome one another, and all things wax and wane, ceaselessly succeeding one another without pause. Thus life begets life without end, qi follows qi in unbroken succession, and since kalpas immemorial, this has never once ceased. Those who attain life harmonize with pure yang, ascending to heaven as immortals. Those who meet death sink into utmost yin, becoming ghosts upon the earth. Among ghostly beings, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority, strength and weakness, firmness and softness, good and evil—no different from the world of men.\n\nThe Jade Emperor, fearing the wantonness of ghosts and spirits bringing calamity upon humanity, has commanded the Five Emperors and the Three Officials to enforce the laws and decrees that restrain and govern them, with punishments and statutes fully established. Yet in this degenerate age, deceitful people abound, the wellspring of purity has scattered, and malevolent qi sprouts forth. They are disloyal to their lords, unfilial to their parents, violating the teachings of the Three Bonds and Five Constants, casting themselves into death’s embrace. Thus the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens’ old qi, along with the defeated armies and dead generals of past ages, band together to harm the living, riding the winds and rains, seizing upon weakness and opportunity to spread manifold diseases, inflicting grievous harm. Many do not live out their allotted years, cut down in untimely deaths.\n\nLong ago in the Du Yang Palace, I revealed the *Divine Incantations Scripture* and entrusted it to the Perfected One Tang Ping, bidding him disseminate it to save humanity. Yet the ignorant and foolish of the world, seeing names like Wang Jian and Bai Qi, dismiss it as mere fabrication. These were once generals in life, leading armies in death as ghostly commanders. Those who accumulated merit were promoted to yin officials, while the cruel and violent remained bound to demonic ranks, riding the败 qi of the five phases to bring plague and pestilence. Yet they fear the might of yang and are subdued by divine incantations, which shall surely eradicate them.\n\nNow I bestow upon you the transformed scripture of divine incantations. Follow and practice it to protect and shelter the myriad people.\" Thereupon, he commanded an attendant to open the ninefold radiance and present the scripture along with the secrets of the Three and Five Great Fasts, saying: \"Strive to practice these hidden merits, and you may hope to fulfill the ranks of immortality.\" With these words, the Dao Lord and his retinue of Perfected Ones ascended toward the northwest.\n\nZuan then followed the scripture’s teachings and fasts, practicing them throughout the Jiangnan region. The people thrived in peace, and pestilence was dispelled. From the Jin dynasty to the present, those who have received its blessings are beyond count. This depends on purity, reverence, utmost sincerity, and diligence—clarity and sincerity evoke response as surely as echo answers sound. Should one grow lax, careless, or recklessly divulge these teachings, one will incur fault and guilt. Those who cultivate and uphold these practices must heed this warning.\n\nMoreover, this scripture is vast and profound, proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Primordial Emperor himself, its principles deep and abstruse. The Supreme’s subtle words and secret instructions, if recited with a devoted heart and unwavering intent, will kindle incense and summon the true spirits in an instant. Divine soldiers and celestial officers will sweep away evil like lightning, while fierce steeds and heavenly escorts will dispel pestilential miasmas wherever they go. Now, seeking skilled hands once more, we reopen this auspicious cause, exhausting the art of carving and the subtlety of ink, hoping its practice will not fade and its dissemination will know no bounds. May the imperial reign endure and surpass the Zhou’s divination, may the emperor’s years stretch far and exceed Yao’s longevity. May the realm’s chariots unite under one sky, its calendar extend to all lands. Praise the power and virtue of the Great Dao, aiding the imperial court’s benevolent nurturing. Boundless are the vast blessings and mysterious grace!\n\n*The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Scripture*, Scroll One\n*The Vow Against Demons* Chapter\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"Long ago, above the Three Heavens, I expounded the immeasurable scriptures to all men and women, teaching and transforming all beings. At that time, the Perfected One Wei Mingluo and four hundred ninety thousand heavenly hosts from the lower worlds arrived above the Three Heavens to hear the immeasurable great scriptures, bringing peace within and without. Mingluo and the others arose, bowing thrice to the Supreme, and inquired: 'Is the teaching and transformation of the Heavenly Worthy difficult?' They humbly expressed their sentiments.\n\nThe Supreme said: 'Have you come from Jambudvīpa?'\nMingluo and the others replied: 'Yes.'\nThe Supreme said: 'Among the people of the world, are there any who follow the Dao, uphold the scriptures, and study immortality?'\nMingluo and the others said: 'The people of the world accumulate evil and do not believe in the Dao or its methods.'\"\n\nAmidst these sounds, only the wails of mourning corpses are heard, never the melodies of immortals’ songs. The people are filthy and defiled, the Three Caverns blocked and obstructed. The calamities of the hundred and six disasters—blades, warfare, epidemics, and sickness—rage unchecked. Demon kings unleash their poisons, slaughtering the good and virtuous. Every household suffers misfortune, and cries of sorrow follow one after another. Beings devour one another, inflicting suffering upon themselves. Drawn into death together, they cling to ignorance and endure torment, utterly unaware of escape. How can such people be delivered?\n\nUpon hearing Mingluo and the others speak thus, the Supreme addressed the assembled gods and humans: “What do beings ponder? They know not the Dao or its methods, nor do they understand what they endure. They commit evil of their own accord, then slander one another. The Three Caverns’ teachings circulate widely, yet none receive and uphold them—like blind men wandering beneath the sun and moon. Are the sun and moon not bright? The blind cannot see. Though Dharma masters proclaim and transform, fools remain unmoved.”\n\nThen the Supreme, leading eighty million billion heavenly beings and jade maidens, descended to save them, passing through Jade Capital. Atop Jade Capital Mountain stood a peach tree, its height spanning three hundred ninety billion miles. Its eastern branch sheltered the eastern lands, its southern branch covered the southern realms, its western branch shaded the west, and its northern branch blanketed the north. Once every forty-nine billion years it bloomed, and once every eighty billion years it bore a single fruit. When ripe, the fruit was as large as a cartwheel; one who ate of it would hunger no more for three thousand years. Ghosts who beheld this peach tree would perish of their own accord. Each heavenly being took up a branch of this peach wood and descended to slay the plague ghosts, and all manner of auspicious signs arose.\n\nThe Dao declared: “From the years *xinsi* and *renwu* onward, ghostly soldiers have run rampant, and demon kings have spread their poisons, afflicting the people with toxic illnesses. I now dispatch forty-nine billion enforcers to seize the thirty-six heavenly demon kings and bring them down to swear an oath: ‘From this day forward, if the people of any land suffer unjust deaths, sudden illnesses, imprisonment, or bondage, it is because these demon kings have failed to restrain their underlings, allowing them to harm the seed of the people. Henceforth, by the golden decree of the Supreme, any who disobey shall cause the people of their lands to suffer epidemics, warfare, hardship, imprisonment, bondage, and deaths without reason. This will be the fault of the demon kings who first failed to restrain their underlings—thus they shall be slain without mercy.’”\n\nThereupon, the Supreme sent forth forty-nine myriad officials from the ten directions, along with thirty million heavenly maidens and the Great Brahmā King, to summon the thirty-six heavenly demon kings and eighty billion myriad lesser ghost kings, together with their wives, children, and retinues, to swear a solemn oath. The Queen Consorts of the Dark Maiden and Māhādevī, numbering thirty-six myriad, all came as well to assist the Supreme in reprimanding the demon kings. The demon kings prostrated themselves and each dispatched their demonic sons and warrior attendants to patrol the borders of the lands, protecting the people within, lest the Supreme execute them.\n\nThe Brahmā Sons of the Nine Heavens, the great demon kings, their kings and consorts, and their multicolored maidens all bowed thrice and submitted to the Supreme’s teachings.\n\nThe Dao declared: “From the time of Fuxi until the end of the Han, the people lived in great joy, yet most did not believe in the Dao. They all received the natural *qi* of heaven’s demonic influences, unaware of the Dao, unaware of the Dharma, unaware of the scriptures, serving only the natural order. Later, those who believed in the scriptures were few indeed. In the era of the Great Jin, as the world approached its end, the people lacked purity. Lineages arose to govern the people of the world, first enduring much suffering—oppressed from above and below—before gradually flourishing. Their prosperity lay in the lands east of the Yangzi, where heaven and humanity converged, and the *qi* of the Dao flourished.\n\nThe kalpa’s end draws near, yet within it, some will attain the Three Treasures, the immeasurable *Shangqing*, the *Huangting* records of immortality, the *Taisu*, and the *Lingbao* samādhi. These people all possess great blessings from past lives, their fortune flowing into future incarnations. Upon hearing and seeing these scriptures, they will escape the calamities of the Three Rivers’ great floods.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! You men and women—whether kings, emperors, lords, governors of two thousand households, or even the lowliest, including slaves and servants—if you can attain these scriptures and receive these covenants and registers, your names will enter the ranks of immortals, and you shall never suffer unjust deaths.”\n\nIn the Palace of Mystic Radiance, the Supreme expounded this divine incantation scripture. Eight hundred million myriad of the Nine Heavens’ great demons, rākṣasas, ghostly bandits, and the retinues of all the heavens gathered in attendance, listening to the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse. Each clasped their hands and prostrated themselves upon the ground. The Heavenly Worthy then expounded the great scripture of immortal records, and all who heard it felt their bodies undergo wondrous transformations.\n\nThe Dao declared: “Listen carefully, for I shall now speak to you of the kalpa’s end in the ages to come. Three thousand years after Fuxi, great floods overflowed, and half the people perished. For thirty-six years, the myriad clans rebelled, slaughtering one another. By the time of the Zhou and Qin’s fall, the people were nearly annihilated. By the end of the Han and Wei, the people were displaced, and half died. When the Liu clan’s fifth-generation descendants inherited their ancestors’ legacy, the four directions cried out in distress, the world teetered on the brink of ruin, and the people could not dwell in peace. Driven and oppressed by the Six Barbarians, they fled to the lands east of the Yangzi, while the gentry concealed their traces, also taking refuge along the Huai and the sea. In the year *jiawu*, the people returned to dwell in the Central Kingdom. Chang’an flourished, the Qin Plain rejoiced, the Six Barbarians submitted as vassals, and all dwelt in the mountains and marshes, not within the central plains. The Dao’s teachings prospered.\n\nYet the *Wooden Son with Bow Mouth* shall rise again.”\n\nThe Dao declared: “As the great kalpa nears its end, the ruling kings fail to govern, and the people sigh in despair. Winds and rains come untimely, the five grains do not ripen, and the hearts of the people turn wicked, rebelling and defying authority. Fathers and sons, brothers and kin plot against one another, leading to annihilation. Grievances and banditry spread, slaughtering the innocent. In such an age, epidemic *qi* abounds, and ninety kinds of illness afflict the world, killing the wicked. Among them is the Red-Headed Slayer Ghost, a ghost king a myriad leagues tall, leading thirty-six billion slayer ghosts.”\n\nEach ghost wields a crimson staff, roaming the world to seek out the living—awaiting them in the fourth month. Where blue *qi* appears, people die suddenly; where red *qi* appears, swelling diseases arise; where yellow *qi* appears, dysentery strikes; where white *qi* appears, cholera rages; where black *qi* appears, legal troubles befall. These ghosts carry such *qi* and spread it across the world, slaying the foolish. Only Daoist masters and dharma teachers who receive this divine incantation sutra are attended by ninety billion myriad great spirits, spontaneous warriors, celestial beings, and jade maidens, all coming to guard and protect. Those who uphold and venerate it will see all illnesses vanish and never suffer an untimely death. Should neighboring states send great bandits to invade, recite this sutra, and the bandits will retreat of their own accord.\n\nAs the men and women present heard the Most High expound this sutra, each rose in alarm and performed the threefold bow. The disciples then declared their wish to receive this sutra.\n\nThe Dao declared: “As the kalpa’s end draws near, the people grow ever more wicked. Yet among them, those who believe in the Dao and uphold the sutras are all celestial beings, not foolish worldly folk. The Great Sage, seeing the world’s corruption and chaos, dispatched celestial beings to descend and be born in the Middle Kingdom, aiding the times and transforming through teaching. Among the Son of Heaven’s ministers, dukes, governors, and military officers—even those of lowly station—if they wholeheartedly believe in the Dao, heed the sutra, and put it into practice, immortals will guide them. But those who hear this sutra and refuse to receive and uphold it—know that such people have come from the six kinds of livestock and share no karmic affinity with the sutra. Thus, when the great flood comes, they will be devoured by fish and turtles, swept away with the mud, and none will escape.”\n\nThe Dao declared: “From this day forth, whether man or woman, if one hears and receives this sutra—regardless of status, be they slave or free, public or private—those who copy, uphold, and venerate its scrolls will gain blessings in every life, rise in rank day by day, recover from illness, and see all wishes fulfilled. For those who uphold this sutra, the Great Demons of the Three Heavens, the Great Demons of the Nine Heavens, the thirty-six generations of demons, and the ten directions’ slayer ghosts—along with their kings, wives, children, and retinues—all swear a dark oath. The Queen of the Dark Maidens, the Lady of the Hemp Maiden, and thirty-six million royal consorts unite to serve as the Most High’s Demon-Subduing King. The demon kings all submit, each dispatching their demon offspring and warrior attendants to patrol the borders, shielding the people within the realm, fearing the Most High’s punishment. The Brahma Sons of the Nine Heavens, the Great Demon Kings of the Celestial Beings, their kings, consorts, and maidens—all perform the threefold bow and obey the Most High’s teachings.”\n\nThe Dao declared: “From Fuxi’s time to the end of the Han, the people lived in great joy, yet most did not believe in the Dao. They all received the spontaneous demonic *qi* of Heaven, unaware of the Dao, unaware of the dharma, unaware of the sutras, serving only the spontaneous. Later, those who believed in the sutras were few indeed. In the Great Jin’s era, as the world neared its end, the people lacked purity. Yet from the imperial line, a successor arose to govern the world’s people. At first, they endured much suffering—oppression from above, urgency from below—before gradually flourishing. Their prosperity lay in the lands east of the Yangtze, where celestial and mortal realms converged, and the *qi* of the Dao flourished. As the celestial kalpa’s end approaches, some will attain the Three Treasures, the immeasurable Upper Clarity, the *Huangting* Records of Immortals, the *Taisu* Scripture, and the *Lingbao* Samadhi. Such people all possess great blessings from past lives, their fortune flowing into future incarnations. Hearing this sutra, they will escape the calamity of the Three Rivers’ great flood.\n\n“Excellent indeed! Whether you are men or women—kings, emperors, regional lords, or governors of two thousand households; even the foolish, regardless of slaves—if you encounter this sutra, receive this covenant and register, your names will enter the ranks of immortals, and you will never suffer an unjust death.”\n\nThe Most High, in the Palace of Mystic Radiance, expounded this divine incantation sutra. The Great Demons of the Nine Heavens, rakshasa ghosts, bandits, and the retinues of all heavens—eight hundred million myriad beings—all gathered in attendance, listening to the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse. Each clasped their hands and prostrated themselves in reverence. The Heavenly Worthy then revealed the great sutra of immortal records. All who heard it felt a wondrous transformation within.\n\nThe Dao declared: “Listen carefully, for I shall now speak of the kalpa’s end in the age to come. From Fuxi’s time, after three thousand years, great floods overflowed, and half the people perished. For thirty-six years, the myriad clans rebelled, slaughtering one another. By the time of the Zhou and Qin’s fall, the people were nearly wiped out. By the end of the Han and Wei, the people were displaced, and half died. Then, the five generations of Liu’s descendants restored their ancestral foundation. At that time, the four directions cried out in distress, the world teetered on the brink, and the people could not live in peace. Driven by the six barbarians, they fled to the lands east of the Yangtze, while the gentry concealed their traces, also seeking refuge in the Huai and the sea. In the year of *jiawu*, the people returned to dwell in the Middle Kingdom. Chang’an opened its gates, the Qin River plains rejoiced, the six barbarians submitted as vassals, and all dwelt in the mountains and marshes, not within the central plains. The Dao’s teachings prospered.\n\nYet the *Wooden Son with Bow Mouth* shall rise again.”\n\nThe Dao declared: “As the great kalpa nears its end, the ruling kings fail to govern, and the people sigh in despair. Winds and rains come untimely, the five grains do not ripen, and the hearts of the people turn wicked, rebelling and defying authority. Fathers and sons, brothers and kin plot against one another, leading to annihilation. Grievances and banditry spread, slaughtering the innocent. In such an age, epidemic *qi* abounds, and ninety kinds of illness afflict the world, killing the wicked. Among them is the Red-Headed Slayer Ghost, a ghost king a myriad leagues tall, leading thirty-six billion slayer ghosts. Each ghost wields a crimson staff, roaming the world to seek out the living—awaiting them in the fourth month. Where blue *qi* appears, people die suddenly; where red *qi* appears, swelling diseases arise; where yellow *qi* appears, dysentery strikes; where white *qi* appears, cholera rages; where black *qi* appears, legal troubles befall. These ghosts carry such *qi* and spread it across the world, slaying the foolish. Only Daoist masters and dharma teachers who receive this divine incantation sutra are attended by ninety billion myriad great spirits, spontaneous warriors, celestial beings, and jade maidens, all coming to guard and protect.”\n\nShould any uphold and venerate this sutra, all maladies shall vanish of themselves, and none shall meet untimely death. Should neighboring states send great bandits to invade, recite this sutra in turn, and the bandits shall depart of their own accord.\n\nAt this, the men and women seated before the Most High, upon hearing this sutra expounded, each rose in astonishment and performed the threefold bow. The disciples then declared their wish to receive this sutra.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The kalpa’s end draws near, and the people grow ever more wicked. Yet among them, those who believe in the Dao and uphold this sutra are all heavenly beings, not the foolish of this world. The Great Sage, seeing the world mired in chaos, dispatched heavenly beings to descend and be born in the Middle Kingdom, to aid in the teaching and transformation of the age.\n\nAmong the Son of Heaven’s ministers, the dukes and princes, the magistrates and commanders, even those of lowly station—if they wholeheartedly believe in the Dao, hear this sutra, and put faith in its use, immortals shall guide them. But if one hears and sees this sutra yet refuses to receive and uphold it, know that such a person has come from among the six kinds of livestock and shares no karmic affinity with this sutra. Thus, when the great flood comes, they shall be devoured by fish and turtles, swept away with the mud, and ten thousand shall not escape.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, whether man or woman, should any hear and see this sutra and receive and uphold it—regardless of whether they be male or female, bondservant or free, public or private—those who receive it, copy it, and venerate its scrolls shall, in every life, reap benefit: their official ranks shall rise daily, illnesses shall be cured, and all wishes shall accord with their hearts. Should any receive and uphold this sutra, the great demons of the Three Heavens, the great demons of the Nine Heavens, the demons of thirty-six worlds, and the slayer ghosts of the ten directions shall be swept away, and the people shall perish utterly. Only the Daoists and those who receive this sutra shall be welcomed by nine dragons, and a hundred billion heavenly beings shall come to distinguish good from evil—you must believe this.\n\nIf one falls ill, first examine the affliction, then receive and uphold this sutra. If one faces legal troubles or imprisonment, or suffers constant misfortune, receive this sutra. If one is plagued by madness, slander, or myriad disputes, receive this sutra. For all that is inauspicious, receive this sutra. Those who receive this sutra shall not be harassed by demon kings.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In this age of the Five Turbidities, worldly officials oppress with severity, showing no mercy to those below. The people sigh in distress, and the myriad folk harbor resentment. The world drifts in chaos, the sun and moon lose their measure, the five grains fail to ripen, many become refugees, and great floods arise. The wise, upon seeing this sutra, should hasten to receive it, transcribe its scrolls, and store them in bamboo chests, baskets, or boxes, placing them upon a high seat. If not, they may also be kept in five-colored pouches. Those who recite it in turn shall see demonic soldiers scatter of themselves and legal troubles resolved. Should one in a household receive this sutra, it shall avert calamity from that entire household. Even if one is illiterate, merely receiving it and hiring another to copy it, then venerating it within the home, shall cause evil ghosts to submit, and none shall dare approach.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, wherever this sutra is recited, should there be illness, legal troubles, slander, or depletion within the household, hear this sutra’s admonition and recite the demon-subduing incantation. Should any ghost refuse to depart, falsely claiming to be a great spirit—whether a mountain or forest deity, a local earth god, a temple master, a fallen soldier or general, or a ghost freed from the registers—if they come to aid the demon kings, afflicting the people of the world and refusing the Great Dharma, the slayer gods of the ten directions shall seize and execute them. Should they return again, persisting in violence and inflicting cruel harm, the ghost kings shall slay them, and the demon kings shall rend their bodies into ten thousand pieces, granting no mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe Dao spoke: The world grows ever more hurried, and the people ever more wicked, while those who believe in the Dharma are few. The great flood draws near, and I fear many of you shall drown and perish, unaware of the time of deliverance. My compassion is deep, and so from the Ninefold Chamber of the Dark Radiance Palace, I build a bridge for all future sentient beings, open the path of the Dharma, point out the Way, and guide them with the Dharma, that they may escape the Three Calamities, dispel the Nine Perils, avoid the Eight Difficulties, be born among heavenly beings, and ascend to immortality, their blessings endless through countless lives. I move the demon kings to pacify the myriad folk, preemptively reciting this incantation to restrain and banish evil ghosts.\n\nFrom this day forward, wherever this sutra is received and upheld or recited in turn, all shall enjoy every kind of fortune and benefit. In future generations, should men or women receive this sutra and honor their masters, they too shall attain immortality.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The fifth-generation descendant, Liu Zi, shall assist in governing the realm, continuing the lineage of immortals. Among the people of the Great Han, many shall encounter the Three Treasures. Why is this? Because in this world, there are those of auspicious destiny who can awaken the mind of the Dao.\n\nCountless recluses dwell in mountains and forests. As the great kalpa nears its end, seven or eight out of ten have received this sutra. The three disasters loom over you all, yet only those destined for the Dao can believe and uphold it. For the sake of all beings, the Most High wept tears of the Five Phases. If you trust my words, the nine-dragon chariot shall come to welcome you. If you do not, the Three Rivers of Mengjin shall claim you.\n\nHere, three hundred million men and women have all come to receive this sutra.\n\nThe Dao spoke: You have received these twenty scrolls. Honor them, practice them, and maintain them in all actions. The myriad illnesses within your bodies shall heal of themselves. Officials shall rise in rank, and all wishes shall align with your hearts. You shall also behold the True Lord of the future. The True Lord is not far—when the disaster of the *jiashen* year arises, great chaos shall engulf the world. The world shall be swept clean, and heaven and earth shall be reborn. Then the True Lord shall appear.\n\nWhen the True Lord comes, sages, immortals, and all who have received this sutra shall gather to assist. Daoists from the east, west, south, and north shall serve as aides, and none shall be fools. You, the people of this world, need only receive this sutra to naturally behold the True Lord.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The True Lord shall be surnamed *Mu*, given name *Gongkou*, and shall rule the world. The world shall know great joy, with ninefold harvests and human lifespans extended by three thousand years. Heaven and earth shall be renewed, level and harmonious. The sun and moon shall shine brighter than before. Only those who received this sutra in past or present lives shall come to aid the True Lord.\n\nThus, wise Daoists must guide the ignorant, urging them to receive this sutra. All epidemics and illnesses shall be dispelled, demonic bandits shall scatter and flee, and every wish shall bear fruit, all aspirations fulfilled. Wherever this sutra is received and practiced, demon kings shall aid in its propagation, ensuring no evil befalls its bearers.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Male and female Daoists with the bone destiny for immortality shall encounter this sutra. Those whose lifespans align with the True Lord’s advent shall receive it. This sutra holds divine power, opening the hearts of men.\n\nWhen the True Lord appears, the world shall be governed without striving. There shall be no suffering from blades, weapons, or prisons. Under the rule of sages, the people shall prosper in joy, free from greed for wealth. There shall be no chickens, pigs, dogs, rats, oxen, or horses—no six livestock. Phoenixes and white cranes shall be as common as barnyard fowl, and qilin and lions shall be as tame as household beasts. The Dao and its methods shall be the sole concern, and Daoists shall be the great ministers. Men and women shall be chaste, free from lustful thoughts. The people shall grow tall, no longer resembling the Daoists of today. Unaware, their forms shall transform, becoming upright and grand. Humans shall stand thirteen feet tall, and the True Lord sixteen feet. Their faces shall glow with radiance, and among the people, none shall be ugly—all shall be pleasing to behold, their appearance never wearying the eye.\n\nHearing the Most High speak of the True Lord’s realm of great joy, the great assembly was overjoyed. Each rose of their own accord, bowing thrice in reverence. The disciples declared: We too shall uphold this sutra.\n\n*Thus concludes the first scroll of the* Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantation Sutra.\n*Here begins the second scroll of the* Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantation Sutra.\n\n**Chapter on Dispatching Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao spoke: While I resided in the Ninefold Palace of Mystic Capital, expounding the *Supreme Clarity Middle Mystery Sutra* to the great assembly, there arrived from the lower worlds the World-Transcending Divine Marshal, the Perceptive Knowledge-Sentence Lord’s Disciple, and eighty thousand perfected ones. Together they prostrated, bowing thrice before the Heavenly Worthy, and declared: “The people of the world are wicked, disbelieving in the utmost words. Though the Three Caverns’ scriptures have now emerged, none know to receive them. Plague ghosts and blade-wielding soldiers slaughter sentient beings, and when all beings perish, none seek deliverance. We disciples constantly witness this, and the suffering is unbearable to hear. In the lands today, those who govern are but walking corpses, devoid of those who embody the Dao and virtue. Lords and ministers slaughter one another; fathers and sons punish each other. When Daoists practice the Dao, fools mock them ceaselessly. They drag themselves into evil, neglecting the immortal ranks. The great kalpa draws near, yet they remain unaware. Pestilential qi and malignant epidemics will slaughter nearly all. Unable to endure this sight, we have come to earnestly implore.”\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy raised His gaze to heaven and sighed deeply: “Alas! Sentient beings fail to grasp the great purpose, neglecting to cultivate their minds, thus inviting calamity and the ravages of plague. I shall now dispatch eight hundred million celestial marshals and celestial infantry, eight hundred million celestial cavalry, four hundred thousand celestial censors, four hundred thousand celestial executioners, and forty-nine thousand celestial garrison guards to expel these ghosts for humanity. You shall carry this *Divine Incantation Sutra* and propagate it throughout the lands. Wherever people receive this sutra, plague ghosts will depart of their own accord.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From the years *gengchen*, *xinsi*, *renwu*, and *guiwei*, nearing the *jiashen* year, the world will suffer ninety-two kinds of epidemics, slaying the wicked. Without those who embody the Dao, none shall escape this plague. These epidemics will cause alternating chills and fever, headaches and dizziness, disharmony of the five viscera, piercing pain in the heart, nasal congestion, sore throat, coughing, abdominal distension, qi stabbing the heart, cramping of hands and feet, pain piercing the chest and back to the brain, deafness, jaundice, paralysis and swelling, red and black discoloration of the body, and five types of dysentery. There will also be cholera with vomiting of blood, nosebleeds, suppurating sores, shattering pain in the limbs, aching joints, feverish qi driving one to frenzy, sorrowful and disoriented thoughts, sleeplessness at midnight, tossing and turning, incoherent speech, hallucinations of gods and ghosts, swelling of the genitals and lower abdomen, paralysis of hands and feet, and sudden death with loss of consciousness. All such afflictions are the work of plague ghosts come to slay the wicked. If you uphold the teachings of the Three Caverns’ scriptures, I shall command celestial marshals to drive away these ghosts and spare you distress. The deluge is not far off—hasten, all you sentient beings, to cultivate good hearts, receive and transmit the scriptures, and only then shall you escape the great calamity.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, if there are Daoists whose hearts covet the immortal Dao, who seek no worldly glory, who devote themselves entirely to the teachings, who savor the Three Caverns’ scriptures, who follow their masters into the mountains, and who teach and transform others—such people shall have forty-nine billion celestial marshals and infantry dispatched to accompany and protect them. Wherever they go, ten thousand ghosts shall not oppose them. I now command the demon kings: from this day forward, strive for sentient beings and expel all plague ghosts.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “The *jiashen* year approaches, and the great flood is not far off. Plague ghosts now slaughter people, for the world is rife with evil and scarce in goodness. Sentient beings do not recognize the true words; though the Three Caverns’ scriptures have long been propagated, none seek to receive them, thus bringing suffering upon themselves. What more can be done? Sentient beings are pitiable. I shall now dispatch the eight divisions of celestial censors to drive away and slay plague ghosts, banishing them so that Daoists may transform people and lead them to uphold the Three Caverns’ teachings.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, those who receive and uphold this *Divine Incantation Sutra* shall have thirty thousand celestial generals with dark blades covering their bodies. You need only teach and transform all foolish people daily. Fools cling to delusion and mock those who practice goodness—heaven shall dispatch plague ghosts to drive away and slay such people. Their souls shall all enter the three evil destinies, with no hope of escape.”\n\nThe Dao of old said: “In the *xinsi* and *renwu* years, eighty million great ghosts shall come to annihilate the wicked. Those who slander the Dao and its teachings with double tongues, who utter the names of masters, who criticize the scriptures, who disbelieve in the Three Caverns, and who refuse to receive the Dao—such people shall be destroyed by the great ghost kings.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, where Daoists submit to the Three Caverns’ teachings and practice the Dao to save people, I shall dispatch ninety trillion celestial soldiers from the Nine Heavens to descend at once and protect you. If a single ghost remains, the marshals of the ten directions shall come to seize it.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, where Daoists transmit this sutra, heaven shall command four hundred ninety thousand marshals of the Three Caverns, eight hundred thousand marshals of the Six Heavens, and ninety billion celestial soldiers from the Thirty-Six Heavens to descend together and slay these plague ghosts. Those among the living who are afflicted with illness or entangled in official matters shall swiftly gain liberation, their ailments lightened and cured, their myriad spirits harmonized, and their families filled with joy. Domestic and external altars and stoves shall all be settled, sparing the living from unjust harassment. All ghosts not of ancestral worship shall be exorcised, banished forever to distant lands. If any ghost disobeys My command and refuses to depart, the demon kings shall each be beheaded without mercy. Beware, for the sage does not speak idly.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “This *Divine Incantation Sutra* names thirty-six celestial demon kings and seventy trillion lesser kings. Where Daoists transmit this sutra, the thirty-six celestial demon kings and the seventy-two lesser kings, including the Perceptive Knowledge-Sentence Lord’s Disciple, shall all submit. Thus, those who, at the end of the kalpa, receive and enshrine this *Divine Incantation Sutra* in their homes shall have all evil ghosts barred from reckless approach.”\n\n“Why is this so? All great demon kings dispatch divine warriors to guard this sutra. Heavenly beings, jade maidens, and immortals—hundreds of millions in number—also come to protect it, so that no ghostly soldiers dare approach recklessly.\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, wherever this sutra is transmitted, if any evil ghosts or malevolent spirits dare harbor ill intent toward the living or the Dharma masters, the ghost kings and the eight hundred million great demon kings shall swear to suffer the Three Beheadings, their heads shattered into thirty thousand pieces.”\n\nThe demon kings declared: “From this day forward, if Daoists heal the sick, transmit the sutras, or perform meritorious deeds, we shall ensure their every endeavor succeeds, their every wish fulfilled, with no desire left unanswered. Should we violate this oath, we, your disciples—including the Sentence Lord’s Disciple—shall each suffer ten thousand beheadings.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, as the Three Caverns’ teachings spread and perfected beings receive them, how much more so for the ignorant. Whoever upholds these Three Caverns’ sutras shall have ghostly soldiers aid them, their works accomplished, their deeds aligned, and the great demon kings protect them. You, Daoists, must diligently convert the ignorant. Those who receive these teachings shall become masters of the Three Caverns, traversing the world to deliver salvation. If one suffers a sudden illness, let the Daoist transmit the sutra and recite this divine incantation, and the thirty-six celestial demon kings shall summon all lesser ghost kings to lend their strength to the disciple.\n\nThe Dao spoke: “When Daoists receive this *Divine Incantation Sutra*, it must not be received alongside other sutras but separately. Why? Because the great demon kings within this sutra possess immense divine power, and thus it must not be mixed with others. It must be transcribed and stored in a separate case. Carry it with you, and ten thousand ghosts shall not draw near. When performing purification rites, employ boundless rituals.\n\nThe Dao spoke: “This *Divine Incantation Sutra* contains the names of all ghost kings, which is why the Most High esteems it. Wherever this sutra is transmitted, no evil ghosts may approach. Only the ancestral spirits, familial ghosts, and household deities of the living may remain; all others must not come recklessly. The great spirits within and beyond, all *wangliang* spirits, deities of life and death, auspicious male and female spirits, and tomb ghosts—from this day forward, banish them ten thousand *li* away. Should they disobey, you shall die ten thousand deaths, without mercy.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “In the world, there are eighty thousand drowning ghosts, each three feet and two inches tall, moving in countless swarms to kill people in the waters. Those who do not believe in the Dao shall not be protected by benevolent spirits and shall die in vain. There are further ninety-eight myriad kinds of water-borne illnesses, thirty-two types of black, white, red, green, and yellow diseases that cannot be cured, and thirty-six kinds of sudden deaths—all afflictions of the sinful. The people of the world do not practice the Dao and law, bringing chaos to the land. Thus, the heavens gather the wicked, who refuse to contemplate goodness, and dispatch divine warriors to punish them with ten thousand diseases. From this day forward, where Daoists perform meritorious deeds and establish purification rites to save people, the demon kings shall all assist these Dharma masters in healing illnesses. If the affliction does not abate, the demon king Gao Linzhi’s head shall be shattered into ninety pieces.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “You, all demon kings, from this day forward, if the men and women of the Middle Kingdom believe in the Dao, receive Our Three Caverns’ teachings, and propagate them across the ten thousand lands, healing the sick and transmitting the sutras wherever they go—you must convert the ignorant, assist in their meritorious works, turn back winds, and halt rains, preventing harm from approaching. Those who do so shall be elevated ten thousand ranks. Should you violate this oath, your heads shall be shattered into ninety pieces.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “All divine kings and all demon kings, you share the same primordial *qi* of Non-Action as I. Yet your conduct differs, and in a hundredfold comparison, you do not equal even one part of Me. Though you possess great divine transformations, you remain My disciples. Why? Because you have not cultivated the natural Dao *qi* and have long harbored malevolent hearts, dwelling within the cycle of birth and death. It is only due to the great blessings accumulated in your past lives that you have attained the ranks of divine kings and demon kings. I, however, reside above the Three Heavens, governing all spirits. From past kalpas, I have pitied all beings as if they were My own children. My laws can give life to the good, perfect the good, slay the malevolent, and eradicate the wicked—not only among livestock and beasts, but also among the virtuous. Now, the great teachings of the Three Caverns spread throughout the world, and the good people of the land often encounter these scriptures. Where Daoists heal the sick and save people, you, demon kings, must assist them in their meritorious works, ensuring their vows are preserved and their virtues unbroken. Should you violate this oath, you shall be beheaded without mercy.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “In the world, there are many great spirits and long-standing demon kings. You, too, share the same primordial *qi* of Non-Action as I. Yet your conduct differs, and in a hundredfold comparison, you do not equal even one part of Me. You have long submitted as My disciples, and your life and death rest in My hands. All people dwell within heaven and earth, yet many do not believe in the Dao. Now, the teachings of the Three Caverns spread throughout the world, and those who encounter these scriptures—where Daoists heal the sick and save people—you must assist them, ensuring their virtues are not broken. Should you violate this oath, you shall be beheaded without mercy.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “The eight hundred million great demon kings, along with eight hundred million lesser kings, shall each proclaim this decree: from this day forward, wherever the Three Caverns’ teachings spread and Daoists heal the sick or transmit the sutras, you must all assist them. Ensure their treatments succeed, their works are accomplished, and heavenly beings protect them. Let winds and rains come in their proper seasons, without causing harm.”\n\nShould any violate the precepts, showing disrespect for sacred words, and unleash their demonic soldiers to wrongfully kill good people or masters of the Three Caverns—causing unwarranted calamities, illnesses, or suffering, all contrary to their sworn oath—then the thirty-six demon kings, including Wuliuzi, shall be beheaded without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: “Many in the land do not believe in the Great Dao. Those who receive the Three Caverns’ teachings—you must assist them, ensuring their good hearts ever flourish and never wane. Protect them, and heavenly beings shall come to their aid. Since ancient times, the people have suffered myriad illnesses, not merely one kind, afflicted by a thousand ailments and ten thousand torments: headaches, bodily heaviness, limbs that cannot be lifted, disorientation, vomiting, bloody rashes, and qi disorders. I know well the names of your ghosts—Rishen You’ai Zi, Jiao’er Pingwang, Axin of the Three Karma—and the thousand and ten thousand ghosts. Quickly withdraw your lesser ghosts and let the sick recover. Should they not recover, your heads shall shatter into eighty pieces.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “In the *jiazi* cycle of years, seventy-two kinds of illness shall arise. The Xianbei in Chang’an shall slaughter the people wantonly. The south of Chu shall fall into ruin, its people scattered to other lands. Two barbarian hordes and the Three Hao shall unite to contend for it. Wise ministers in the lands east of the Yangtze shall once more aid the realm. The world shall know no joy; the people shall sigh in bitterness, and the lowly shall grieve. Wandering spirits shall come daily to claim lives, and the people shall perish utterly. Among them, if even one or two receive the teachings and practice the Dao, evil men shall mock them. Thus, immortals shall not appear, and the world shall know no immortals.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “In the *jiaxu* cycle of years, the people of the land shall flee together to the lands east of the Yangtze, swarming around Chang’an. In Shu and Han, thirty thousand red demons shall slaughter the people, for they do not believe in the Dao. I once sent Dong Xuanko and Yin Zhongkan to transform the foolish of the world, yet the foolish did not believe. What is to be done? Heaven shall now send one hundred and twenty kinds of illness to kill them. If there are masters of the Three Caverns’ scriptures who come to transmit these divine incantations, the dead shall live again. I hereby command all demon kings and lesser kings: wherever a master heals the sick, you must restrain the lesser ghosts and let the sick recover. If they recover, you shall be promoted. If they do not, you shall die.”\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the command of the Most High—so be it by law!\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiashen* cycle of years, the world shall see forty-nine myriad black ghosts slaughtering people, many meeting violent deaths. When the time of *zi* and *chou* arrives, the appointed day shall draw near, and a great slaughter of eighty myriad red soldiers shall come to claim the people—yet the people shall not know. In the years *renwu*, *guiwei*, and *jiashen*, great floods shall drown the land, and plague and war shall gather. The great ghost king Jiang Gongyan shall come with them to kill. From this day forth, if lesser ghosts dare to afflict the sick, they must flee a thousand *li* at once. Should they refuse to depart, the great demon kings shall shatter their heads into eighty fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiawu* cycle of years, thirty-six myriad Qiang and Hu ghosts of the Liao shall come to slay the people. Seventy myriad red crows shall fly across the heavens, and those who see them shall fall ill with plague, beyond all cure. For they do not believe in the sacred teachings, and thus they shall die of sickness. From this day forth, wherever in the land a single person receives the scriptures and transmits these divine incantations, the great demon kings and heavenly beings shall come to aid them, and the sick shall recover of themselves. If they recover, you shall be promoted ten thousandfold. Should they not recover, you, the great kings and lesser ghosts, shall be hewn into ten thousand pieces without mercy.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiachen* cycle of years, the world shall suffer ninety kinds of illness. Many shall die suddenly, and the six livestock shall be stricken with pestilence—for the people do not believe in the Great Dao. If one person receives the scriptures and practices the Dao, the foolish shall mock them. Therefore, Heaven shall dispatch thirty-nine thousand great ghosts to punish them, and the people shall fall ill as plague ghosts come to kill. If there are masters who transmit these divine incantations, eighty myriad billions of mighty heavenly warriors shall come to their aid. Should the sick not recover and die, the great demon kings shall first seize the lesser ghosts. Swiftly restrain your underlings, and do not harm the good people. This is proclaimed to all below—there shall be no pardon.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiayin* cycle of years, sixty kinds of illness shall strike, and nine out of ten shall die. Wang Jian shall lead them, bringing violent chaos upon the people, along with the red crow ghosts. From this day forth, wherever a Daoist transmits this scripture, the sick shall recover of themselves. Should they not recover and bring misfortune upon the people, the great ghost kings shall first seize the lesser ghosts and shatter their heads into forty-nine fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The world is filled with wicked people, unfit for the abode of the sacred. Yet when a Daoist establishes the teachings of the Three Caverns, heavenly beings shall all come to protect them. From this day forth, if there are those gravely ill and in peril, the great demon kings shall sever the lesser ghosts of their households, and the sick shall recover of themselves. If they recover, the great demon kings shall ascend. If they do not, you shall be hewn into ten thousand pieces. There are countless lesser ghosts in the world—depart at once, and do not let the living die. Should you disobey this teaching, I shall now dispatch forty-nine myriad millions of red *ding* envoys to slay the great demon kings—there shall be no mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the command of the Most High—so be it by law!\n\nThe Dao speaks: From the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh month in the *renwu* year to the third day of the tenth month in the *renchen* year, seventy-two myriad lesser ghost kings shall roam into people’s homes, spreading swift and grievous illness—all shall suffer. Li Xin and Li Ling, each leading forty myriad troops, shall come to claim lives. I now know your names—flee at once! Here, seventy-two myriad red slayer-warriors shall hew you. If you do not flee swiftly, your bodies shall be shattered into ten thousand fragments without mercy—depart ten thousand *li* at once!\n\nThe Dao speaks: The Daoist teachings take the Three Caverns as their foundation. Only by receiving these divine incantations may one enter the mountains or the world of men to slay all ghostly marauders. Without this text, ghosts shall not fear mortals. Now, thirty-six myriad violent ghosts come to kill—I know your names. Flee a thousand *li* at once!\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\n\n*Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Most High Cavern Abyss, Scroll the Second—Concluded*\n*Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Most High Cavern Abyss, Scroll the Third—Chapter on Binding Ghosts*\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this year of *wuyin* in the *guiwei* epoch, the great kalpic turn arrives. Wicked men disbelieve in the Daoist teachings, so Heaven dispatches plague ghosts to inflict seventy-two kinds of disease, slaying the evil. The world is vast, yet ghostly soldiers spread their poison—what is to be done? What is to be done?\n\nIf there be those who uphold the Three Caverns, I shall dispatch four hundred ninety myriad warrior-enforcers to bind the unjust and perverse ghosts for these Dharma masters. Wherever Daoists save lives and traverse the land, demon kings shall assist in binding these ghostly soldiers.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The Jade Women of the Three Heavens, together with the consort of the Great Brahmā Heavenly King—eighty myriad in all—descend to hear the scripture and swear an oath, saying: \"From this day forth, wherever people of the world have Three Caverns Dharma masters perform rites to save lives and recite this *Divine Incantation Scripture*, we shall protect them, preventing plague ghosts and all demonic spirits from harassing the Dharma masters. Should they refuse to depart, we shall be the first to suffer the consequences.\"\n\nAt that time, the Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens, along with eighty myriad Jade Women, all descend together and address the Most High, saying: \"From this day forth, wherever Daoists recite this scripture to save the sick, if any ghost comes to obstruct them and refuses to leave, we shall bind them together, ensuring the Dharma masters remain undisturbed and the sick recover. Those who recover do so by our power, and the multitude of sages rejoice.\" The demon kings each swear to bind the plague ghosts.\n\nThen the Most High recites a gāthā:\n*\"Now I proclaim the divine incantations,\nThe spirits of the spells shall all be destroyed.\nThose slain have their own masters,\nFor evil deeds, none shall be spared.\nYou have all sworn submission,\nCome together to hear my scripture.\nFrom this day, assist the Dao,\nEach and every one, lend your aid.\nDo not again conspire in malice,\nNor together plot wicked schemes.\nIf you plot wicked schemes,\nThe warrior-enforcers shall bind your spirits.\nBoiled in cauldrons, burned by fire,\nYou shall ascend and descend the Knife Mountain’s pavilion.\nIf you follow goodness,\nYou shall not suffer such torments.\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *renwu* year, thirty-nine thousand red ghosts shall come to slay the wicked. Those who encounter Three Caverns Dharma masters shall have plague ghosts driven a thousand *li* away. From this day forth, for those afflicted by imprisonment or illness, merely recite this scripture. This scripture commands eighty myriad great spirits, thirty myriad warrior-enforcers, forty myriad Jade Women, and thirty myriad youths—all shall come together to guard wherever the scripture is recited, and demon kings shall bind the plague ghosts.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Long ago, in the Dark Radiance Palace of the Five Marchmounts, I expounded the *Samādhi Scripture* for all sentient beings. At that time, seven heavenly demon kings, thirty myriad in number, descended as one and swore: \"From this day forth, wherever Dharma masters save the sick and recite this *Divine Incantation Scripture*, we shall clear the path, allowing no evil to approach. Evil ghosts shall flee far, and heavenly beings shall come to assist. Those who can be cured shall have their illnesses dispelled, and those imprisoned shall all be freed. If we fail to bring benefit, we shall willingly accept execution by waist severance, even in death having no regrets.\"\n\nThe Dao speaks: After the *renwu* year and the *xinsi* year, there shall surely come plague ghosts, eighty myriad in number, to slay the wicked. The wicked do not believe in the Dao. Thus, the Jade Women of the Three Heavens and the Great Brahmā Kings of the Nine Heavens—thirty-six myriad in all—descend together and address the Most High, saying: \"From this day forth, wherever Dharma masters traverse, we shall protect them, ensuring the sick recover and those entangled in official matters swiftly gain resolution. If plague ghosts again scheme to harm the good people, we shall bind them as well.\"\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this day forth, those who uphold the Three Caverns shall have seven hundred myriad celestial soldiers of the Nine Heavens and seven hundred myriad Great Demon Kings of the Thirty-Six Heavens, each coming to protect these Dharma masters. For households afflicted by illness or official matters, hasten to recite this scripture. This scripture possesses great spiritual power, naturally dispersing official troubles and curing the sick. Should any refuse to submit, the Demon Kings of the Three Heavens shall come to bind them. Plague ghosts and red soldiers shall perish utterly, and the malevolent spirits of calamity—both within and without—shall be driven ten thousand *li* away. Warrior-enforcers from the ten directions shall shield the Dharma masters.\n\nThen the Most High recites a gāthā:\n*\"The Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns,\nThe true principle declares itself.\nWithout eons of cultivation,\nNone may receive and hear it.\nRecite and save the suffering masses,\nDispelling the hordes of ghosts.\nHeavenly perfected ones surround and protect,\nDemonic spirits dare not approach.\nShould any violate the Dharma,\nTheir bodies shall be shattered into a hundred fragments.\"*\n\nAnother gāthā:\n*\"The Great Elephant is originally formless,\nThe scripture’s words become the Dao.\nAs the Dao turns within the formless,\nNo demon or devil shall not be swept away.\nPurity and turbidity each have their place,\nHeavenly officials come to examine.\nYou, who act with cruelty and treachery,\nCause me constant sorrow and vexation.\nBound in reverse, your heads shall be torn,\nEmbrace the Sword Trees—let this be your fate.\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: Now I observe the world—wicked men multiply, the Six Barbarians invade one another, and they mutually destroy. By the *renwu* year, the world shall be in turmoil, the people unsettled. Blade and soldier, plague and *qi*, shall slay the wicked. The wicked do not believe in the Great Dharma, thus they are made to die.\n\nFrom this day, those who uphold the scriptures of the Three Caverns shall attain transcendence as Upper Immortals. The people of the world are foolish and ignorant. They see Daoists die and the wicked die, yet fail to distinguish the difference, seeing only that both die, with no distinction. The wicked die to enter the Three Evil Paths. Daoists die to be reborn in heaven or among men, or to become great kings, or to ascend as immortals, never to be born in evil realms. Some ascend as immortals in broad daylight, having taken elixirs for a thousand years, first attaining youthful vigor. Those who uphold the Three Caverns, honor their teachers, receive the scriptures, endure hardship in practicing the Dao, and attain this immortality shall never die, even after ten thousand kalpas.\n\nFrom this day forward, wherever Daoist priests save people, demon kings and their kind shall gather to seize and bind ghostly spirits.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In former times, I was among thirty thousand Chinese immortals, including Dongyue Zhilianzi, each holding the implements of faith to receive the scriptures. We ascended the mountains to build altars and pay homage to the Five Emperors of the Five Directions. To pledge our faith, we broke a silver ring, dividing it as a contract. We drank the cinnabar elixir with our masters and swore an oath, saying: \"Today we drink the elixir, receive the scriptures, and make offerings, vowing never to transgress for life. For those afflicted by illness, urgent calamities, misfortune in their homes, disputes and lawsuits, or prisoners in jail, we shall recite the scriptures and perform fasts. All shall follow the purifying rites of the fast, and Daoist priests shall make this their constant practice.\" The immortals, having received and transmitted the scriptures, spread transformation throughout the land, curing the illnesses of the myriad people. All ghost kings then concealed themselves in hiding.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Many in the world do not believe in the Dao. When one person receives the scriptures, the multitude laughs at them, saying: \"These demonic beings do not wish to live; they flee into the mountains to avoid people and do not seek official rank.\" They do not know that such a person was born from heaven, seeing the world’s defilement and filth, and seeks the Dao of immortality to deliver all people. Yet people, failing to recognize the truth, instead mock them. Alas, alas! Such people shall later incur grave sins, their transgressions plunging them into the scorching fires and boiling waters of the Red-Linked Hell, where they shall remain for three thousand billion kalpas without hope of release. Once their punishment is complete and they are reborn as humans, they shall possess human form but lack human sentiment. Some shall be foolish, deaf, mute, or unable to comprehend human affairs. Others shall be reborn as the six kinds of livestock, eating grass and drinking water, their flesh offered to humans. From birth, they shall endure hardship and suffering, with no one to whom they may appeal. Such is the cycle of these sinners, without end. Reflect upon my words, disciples.\n\nAt that time, the Most High then spoke a verse:\nObstinate and ignorant of the Dharma,\nThey see the world’s accumulators of sin.\nNot only do they themselves refuse to believe,\nBut they mock those who cultivate the truth.\nUnknowing that they came from heaven,\nSoon they shall lie in the grass of men.\nDisciples, you recognize nothing,\nYet together you pass judgment.\nWords uttered, calamity enters,\nEcho and response in but a moment.\nIn death, they receive the torment of poison,\nTheir sins bound in the Red-Linked Hell.\nTurning through the Five Sufferings,\nThey face judgment for billions of kalpas.\nBorn without human sentiment,\nEnsnared by the six afflictions.\nTheir bodies take the forms of livestock,\nHow could they again know form and spirit?\nTheir sins are not from cultivating the Great Vehicle—\nHow then could they escape bodily ruin?\nThus are the causes and conditions;\nReflect upon my words, disciples.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Many in the world harbor malicious intent and do not believe in true words. Heaven dispatches the generals of wanton slaughter—eighty million strong—to roam the world and seize these wicked people. Now, those who uphold the Three Caverns are protected by thirty thousand demon kings, who follow and shield them, aiding their deliverance. When they wish to perform a fast, on the day of its assembly, the skies shall be clear and bright, free from wind and rain, as heavenly beings assist them. Wherever Daoist priests go, people shall see and cherish them, their Dao-qi overflowing, warding off illness and pain. But those who curse and humiliate Daoist priests, bringing them disputes, lawsuits, or official deceit, shall have their souls and spirits seized and slain, to manifest the divine efficacy of the Great Dao. Hasten, hasten, as in the statutes and decrees!\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the world, there is the Ghost King Wuhuan, seven or eight feet tall, each commanding ninety million red-armored soldiers. Every month, they descend to take the qi and lives of people, causing unjust deaths throughout the land. During the *jiaxu* and *jiawu* ten-day periods, they descend to claim lives, spreading thirty-nine thousand kinds of disease that kill men, women, and children. From this day forward, wherever Daoist priests recite this scripture, you shall withdraw your soldiers and banish them ten thousand miles away. If you refuse, you shall be beheaded. Will the three hundred million soldiers of Wuhuan dare disobey?\n\nThe Dao speaks: During the *jiachen* ten-day period, the great demon kings of the Eight Thousand Nine Heavens, led by Weidu, descend with countless followers. Each month, they afflict people with nine thousand incurable diseases, joining forces with the death-generals and ghost-soldiers of the lower realms to slay humanity. From this day forward, restrain your ghostly soldiers and do not wrong the good people. Wherever male or female Daoist officials practice the Dao, you shall assist them. If you do not follow the Five Teachings, your heads shall be shattered into eighty fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the years *xinsi* and *renwu*, people shall die unjustly, the world shall be in turmoil, and the dead shall be many. The Ghost King Wuhuan and the red-qi of the underworld shall kill people, spreading widespread pestilence. In every household, three or four out of ten shall perish. Alas, alas! Only by holding grand purifying fasts in every village, paying homage to the gods of the Five Emperors, and protecting one’s household shall the heavenly gods take notice. Then the Ghost King Wuhuan shall submit and no longer kill.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From the moment one receives this scripture and the master provides guidance, if there is illness, perform a fast. For lawsuits, prisoners, homes haunted by many ghosts, stagnant official careers, or failed harvests of fields and silkworms, perform this fast. When this fast is held, heavenly beings shall come to protect you, and all your wishes shall be fulfilled without a single misfortune. Those who uphold this scripture shall cause ghost kings to submit. From this day forward, wherever the Dharma Masters of the Three Caverns practice, ghost kings shall protect them. If any Daoist priest falls ill, your heads, O ghost kings, shall be shattered into eighty fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the year *gengchen*, the ruler must be vigilant, and his ministers must assist him, so that the world shall be vast and all shall stand in awe. Yet petty men shall oppress one another, and the noble shall lack the Dao. Ninety kinds of disease shall afflict the world, killing the wicked. The Ghost King named Tanzhi shall lead thirty-six ghost kings, while the Great Demon King of the Seven Heavens, the Luminous Lord, shall descend to spread myriad diseases, all incurable. At that time, the wicked shall be many, and most shall not believe in the Dao.\n\nThose who receive the scriptures—if they receive the Three Caverns—shall be protected by the Great Demon Kings and their forty-nine hundred million followers, who shall descend to assist these Dharma Masters.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When these Three Caverns Dharma Masters enter the gates and dwellings of the people, the myriad ghosts shall flee from them. They shall heal the sick and save the people, and none shall fail to recover. It is because the wicked are many that ghosts are permitted to kill. The Most High, in great compassion, pities all sentient beings and thus gazes upon these ghost kings, commanding them to restrain the myriad poisons.\n\nFrom this day forward, if any Daoist priest encounters misfortune or falls ill, the heads of these ghost kings shall be shattered into eighty fragments.\n\nAt that time, the Most High spoke this verse:\nThe Dao’s law is true within the true,\nWithin the true, there is numinous power.\nWhen the Three Caverns enter a person’s gate,\nThe myriad ghosts all vanish without form.\nDemonic and false, turbid and impure,\nThe nature of the Dao is originally pure.\nSaving and protecting all people,\nUniversally aiding all sentient beings.\nThe Most High extends great compassion,\nDispelling the armies of heavenly demons.\nThe myriad poisons restrain their qi,\nUnable to expend your essence.\nHeads shattered into eighty fragments,\nDelivered to the Heavenly Soldiers.\nThe Heavenly Soldiers shall sever and cut,\nFor crimes incurred, there is no pardon.\nThe Most High has no self or other,\nDistinctions make the Dharma clear.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The world is full of foolish people, for the sages do not instruct them. From this day forward, great floods shall come, approaching the misfortune of warfare. Within the realm, those who do not believe in the Dao shall wrongfully disturb the myriad people. The myriad people, distressed and suffering, not diligent and unaware, shall only appeal to the Most High. Fearing that ghost kings shall wrongfully kill and that the world’s good people shall perish, the Three Caverns scriptures are expounded to transform the world.\n\nFrom this day forward, if any Daoist priest encounters wrongful misfortune, I shall assist them, ensuring that Daoist priests suffer no legal punishments, slander, or illness. Should they one day fail to act according to the law, the Great Demon King shall seize the people, and the ghost kings Wuhuan and their million followers shall have their heads shattered into twelve fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From the year *renwu* onward, those in the world who received the Dao numbered thirty-nine thousand. In Qingzhou and Qinchuan, men and women who attained immortality included Wang Fang, Zhang Xuan, Du Gui, Shu Han, Luo Dao’an, Fei Touran, Li Ying, Zhang Shi, Sun Hongmei, Hou Jin, and Yuan Dao. In the year *jiashen*, they attained immortality. Each ghost king shall protect and assist these followers of the Three Caverns, ensuring they suffer no illness.\n\nIf any person harbors anger toward a Dharma Master, curses, humiliates, strikes, schemes to kill, or plots harm against them, such persons shall be utterly destroyed, their households extinguished. For seven kalpas, they shall have no form, drifting with the wind, clinging to rain, depending on dust, and attaching to grass. Only after ten thousand kalpas shall they regain human form.\n\nThe ghost kings shall protect and assist these Three Caverns Dharma Masters. If any do not believe my words, the Great Demon King Fudan and Wuhuan shall have their heads shattered into ninety fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The thirty-six great demon kings and their ghosts, when the people of the realm do not believe, shall descend from heaven to protect those who uphold the Three Caverns. The Great Demon King and all ghost children shall guard them. If Daoist priests perform rituals to heal the people, you shall dispel evil qi, allowing the Daoist priests to cure illnesses swiftly.\n\nFrom this day forward, those who do not submit shall have the heads of the great ghost kings Wuhuan and their followers shattered into eighty-nine fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The ghost of gates and doors is named Chengbo; the ghost of opening and closing is named Alunran; the ghost of wells and stoves is named Zhenlianzi; the ghost of the four fences is named Shibogong; the ghost of the road is named Wuziding; the ghost of houses and dwellings is named Xuanzidu. Together, they descend, encircling people’s homes and dwellings ten thousandfold, not for the sake of one, but to harm the myriad people for a long time.\n\nFrom this day forward, they shall be banished ten thousand miles away. If they seek to afflict people with illness, the heads of these ghost kings shall be shattered into twelve fragments.\n\nAt that time, the Most High spoke this verse:\nI warn you, ghosts of gates and doors,\nAnd you, spirits of wells and stoves.\nYou who wander the fences,\nDo not harm the good people.\nIf you wish to do evil,\nThe wind’s power shall dissolve your bodies.\nYou should only assist the Dao’s transformation,\nBanishing the lords of evil ghosts.\nDo not again reveal your malevolent hearts,\nSummoning the hordes of corpse-demons.\nIf you submit to the oath,\nYou shall be favored from time to time.\nIf you do not obey the command,\nYour bodies and heads shall be sundered.\n\nAnother verse says:\n\nThe Dao’s natural law rewards the good and punishes the rebellious.\nWhen the rebellious are punished, rebellion dissolves—\ndo not let them be severed from the Way.\nThough you may wish to do evil,\nthe true Dharma will surely impose its reckoning.\nWielding authority, it commands the heavenly hosts,\nexterminating all perverse and deviant forces.\nIf you depart of your own accord,\nyou may yet escape this calamity.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the world there are one hundred thousand Red-Linked Ghosts,\neach three feet and six inches tall, numbering one million.\nThere are three hundred thousand Long-Headed Ghosts,\neach brandishing a red staff, staff-slaying the myriad people.\nFrom the ren-wu year to the ren-chen year, they kill humans—\nthen the great floods shall come.\nIf kings do not govern, the people will die violently;\nin the jia-shen disaster, all shall perish utterly.\nAlas, what is to be done?\n\nDaoists transform the foolish,\nguiding them to receive the Three Caverns—\nonly thus may they escape the nine calamities.\n\nThe Dao declares: The world is in chaos, the people perish utterly,\nmostly slain by the ghost kings.\nThe good do not die; the wicked enter the Three Wretched Realms.\nFrom this day forward, those who die unjustly—\nHeaven too shall aid them.\n\nFrom this day forward, those who become Daoist masters of the Three Caverns Dharma\nshall be protected by the Great Demon Kings.\nIf any Daoist suffers peril, distress, or illness,\nthe ghost kings shall bear the guilt,\ntheir heads shattered into eighty fragments.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward,\nghost kings must not unjustly kill the myriad people.\nWhere Daoists travel to perform scriptures and heal the sick,\nyou must assist in their cure—do not let them remain unwell.\nIf they do not recover, it is because you ignored my words,\nunjustly killing the good.\nYour heads shall be shattered into one hundred and twenty fragments.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Most High’s command,\ndissolve disaster and protect the people—such is the ordinance.\n\n*Thus concludes the third scroll of the* Most High Dongyuan Divine Incantations Sutra.\n*Here begins the fourth scroll of the* Most High Dongyuan Divine Incantations Sutra.\n\n**Chapter on Slaying Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao declares: Since the time of Fuxi, those who perished in ruined armies and defeated battalions, whose forms were maimed in battle, who died by the stench of blades and weapons—countless in their multitudes—have become wandering spirits. Some lie as exposed corpses, their bones disjointed, heads severed from bodies. Some drift or soar, their spirits unable to gather. Some have bodies without heads, feet without hands, mouths without eyes. By the thousands and tens of thousands, they roam and linger, clinging to themselves. They dwell by mountains and lean on trees, seizing the years of human lives. Unaware of their presence, people are plagued by strange disturbances, their hearts unsettled. These ghosts seek to wreak havoc, draining silkworms and fields, bringing every misfortune. They vex households, spawn strange omens, and afflict the living with illness—young and old alike—causing livestock to die suddenly, disputes and legal troubles to arise, and fires and floods to strike repeatedly, rendering all inauspicious. These are none other than the ghosts of those who died untimely in the mortal world, along with Li Ziao of the Clouds, who drift between the heavens and the shores of the sea, riding winds and mounting sparrows, snatching chickens and dogs. Birds and beasts act as portents, cutting short human lives to demand blood offerings. Folk diviners, through their divinations, terrify the living, claiming that deceased kin conspire in these calamities, thus giving rise to vulgar superstitions. When you lesser ghosts hear this, you seize the opportunity to hurl stones with reckless force, ensuring none remain unharmed, heaping misfortune upon misfortune, bringing ruin to the people. You boast: \"Since your time, half of humanity has died unjustly.\"\n\nFrom this day forward, the Great Demon Kings—forty-eight billion in number, each ruling over eight billion lesser kings—shall issue their decrees to gather all the lesser ghosts of the world. When a host falls gravely ill, teetering on the brink of death, you must swiftly seize the ghost afflicting them and banish it a thousand *li* away. Should you disobey, I shall dispatch the Great Slayer Generals—nine hundred million strong—to pursue and slay you without mercy. The Demon Kings shall hasten to apprehend you.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, if any ghost spreads slander among the living, the officials of the Great Yin—one hundred forty thousand strong—shall slay you, the *tuo* ghosts. If any ghost brings legal troubles, imprisonment, or shackles, the Venerable Lord shall send seventy-two thousand to execute you, the ghosts bound by wooden fetters and cangues. If any ghost stirs the *qi* of water or fire, I shall command Song Xianwen to lead the Generals of Wind and Water—two hundred eighty thousand strong—to annihilate you. Thus shall the *dingling* ghosts of shattered tiles, the *shantu muzi* ghosts of ominous trees, the *dayang zousi* ghosts of great calamity, the ghosts of livestock in human form, the *wumu baimei* ghosts of a hundred demonic woods, the *manyidi liao* ghosts of barbarian tribes, the *beidi qianglu* ghosts of northern savages, the ghosts of mountains, the ghosts of valleys, the ghosts of water, the ghosts of fire, the *shegong* ghosts of ten thousand kinds, the ghosts of twelve chaotic illnesses, the ghosts of livestock and servants, the ghosts of self-inflicted death, and all other great and small ghostly minions be driven a thousand *chi* into the earth. Never again shall you afflict the living with illness or legal strife; your ghostly *qi* shall disperse of its own accord. Should you refuse to depart, you shall be slain without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, when Daoists treat the sick and the patient’s family comes to summon you, first craft talismans to place upon the twelve earthly branches, doors, wells, and hearths, each inscribed in cinnabar and hung in its proper place. Then prepare twenty-one talismans for ingestion, to be taken by the patient thrice daily, including three times at night. Thrice daily, the Daoist shall face north in the central courtyard, recite the oral scripture, and perform the *zhuanjing xingdao* ritual, pacing the void in three intervals. If unable to conduct a grand fast, simply follow the Daoist in pacing the void thrice daily. If a grand fast can be held, all must proceed according to the proper method, including the recitation of almsgiving. Almsgiving allows celestial spirits to benefit humanity. Without almsgiving, the spirits of the scriptures will not protect, and the sick shall not recover.\n\n**Sixteen Talismans**\nInscribe in cinnabar on white silk, and affix them according to their respective directions.\n\n**First and second talismans** are to be affixed to the main gate. **Third** on the door. **Fourth** at *mao* (east). **Fifth** at *xun* (southeast). **Sixth** at *wu* (south). **Seventh** at *kun* (southwest). **Eighth** at *you* (west). **Ninth** at *qian* (northwest). **Tenth** at *zi* (north). **Eleventh** at *gen* (northeast). **Twelfth** in the central courtyard. **Thirteenth** above the hearth. **Fourteenth** above the privy. **Fifteenth** in water, to be ingested by the patient. **Sixteenth** should be inscribed as twenty-one talismans, to be taken thrice daily.\n\nThe Dao declares: Now there are the Great Masters of the Three Caverns, the most exalted of all masters. Among the Three Realms, if there are Daoist men or women who receive this, the Ghost Kings shall protect them. They shall cure all illnesses, and neither humans nor ghosts shall suffer harm. From this day forward, if there are Daoists who recite this scripture yet illnesses remain uncured, official ranks unchanged, or legal entanglements unresolved, the Ghost Kings, the Azure Perfected, and the Great Demon Kings shall shatter their heads into twelve pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: All ghosts of the ten directions, every true or false spirit, the eighteen thousand *qi* of the Dao, and the thirty-six myriad red ghosts—from this day forward, each of you must gather your subordinate soldiers and pierce them through. Drive them away ten thousand *li*, lest they afflict the people with illness, including the local earth spirits. Where Daoists recite the scriptures, illnesses shall spontaneously heal, and all wishes shall be fulfilled. If even for a day they do not act according to the method, you great Ghost Kings shall shatter your heads into thirty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: The illnesses of people in this world are caused by Lianzi and his followers, for Heaven has dispatched twelve kinds of mighty warriors to seize them. From this day forward, when the Masters of the Supreme Three Caverns and Daoist priests save the sick by reciting scriptures and pacing the Dao, if the households of men and women holding fasts do not assist the Daoists, causing the sick to remain uncured, they shall be executed without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: Lianzi and his eighty million followers specialize in spreading toxic *qi*, afflicting people with severe pestilential illnesses. Now, three hundred sixty thousand Lianzi followers descend to cause eye diseases. From this day forward, gather your subordinates and sever them. If they do not depart, the Ghost Kings shall shatter their heads into sixty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: There are no truly good people in the world; good people descend from Heaven. Kings who greatly believe in the Dao also come from Heaven. Those who now uphold the Three Caverns must have profound karmic connections from past lives, which is why they now hear and see this. From this day forward, wherever Daoists propagate the teachings, the Ghost Kings shall pursue and assist them, curing the sick and preventing death. If even for a day they do not act according to the method, they shall be executed without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: People in the world do not believe in the Great Law, which is why there are so many sinners. Sinners enter hell, where ghostly soldiers run amok, unable to distinguish good from evil. Now, those who receive the Dao shall have the Great Demon Kings—Zizhen, Konglun, Marshal Mayan, and Chongqi Yuan—each assist and empower them, strengthening their resolve in the Dao. Kings shall uphold it, enlightening the foolish. Where Daoists treat illness, demonic *qi* shall withdraw of its own accord, driven away a thousand *li*. Those who do not submit shall be executed by the Demon Kings without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: The ghosts of the ten directions are all under the command of the Demon Kings. From this day forward, they must not unjustly kill the good or righteous, nor hide by day and move by night to abduct men and women. Where Daoists practice, the Ghost Kings shall assist, preventing evil people and malevolent ghosts from offending the Daoists. If any ghosts or humans harbor ill intentions toward Daoists, they shall all be executed, causing both humans and ghosts to perish, thereby manifesting the resolve of the Dao. These are the supreme words of the Most High—heed them well. If even for a day they are not obeyed, they shall be executed without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: Among the sinners of the world, there are eighty-nine kinds of killing ghosts. The great ghosts of mountains, forests, water, fire, wind, and earth—three thousand nine hundred in number—are led by the Great King of Harmonious Ghosts, who inflict ten thousand kinds of illnesses. The thirty-six kinds of ghosts of the six domestic animals are led by the Ghost King named Dunu, commanding eighty myriad lesser ghosts to spread malignant sores and bloody flux. There are also three thousand crow ghosts, led by the Ghost King named Wenqingzi, who spread red illnesses and white leprosy—diseases that cannot be cured. Those who commit evil, act rebelliously, and do not believe in the essentials of the Three Caverns shall all encounter these malevolent crows, which descend to inflict these diseases, rendering recovery impossible. From this day forward, wherever Daoists save the sick, illnesses shall be eradicated and cured, all wishes fulfilled, and the Ghost Kings shall be elevated to the rank of ten thousand merits.\n\nThe Dao declares: Within the Middle Kingdom, thirty-nine million people are destined for immortality. In the regions of Qin Chuan, Han Shu, and the Three Wu, among them are Sun Daoliu, Wang Zining, Tang Wansheng, Jiao Shizi, Liu Guang, Ma Chengqing, Xun Taichu, Sima Ping, Guo Xiu, Ding Tailun, Yue Fahu, Xie Ying, An Feihou, Wang Zilin, Yuan Boren, Yuan Sunzhi, and Daolin—three thousand in total—who followed Du Lanxiang to gather herbs and all arrived at the Wudang Palace. Now, Daoists who wholeheartedly receive the Three Caverns’ Law shall also encounter these immortals. Daoists must strive to save all people in distress, ensuring their safety. Wherever you recite scriptures and pace the Dao, the Demon Kings shall submit of their own accord. If they do not submit, they shall be executed without mercy, time and again.\n\nThe Dao declares: The essentials of the Three Caverns’ Law lie in divine incantations. Why is this so? This scripture subdues all great Demon Kings, who dare not disturb it. From this day forward, wherever Daoists recite and practice the scriptures, the forty-nine Demon Kings—including Wuchuan, Lianzi, Wenjixiu, Fenglinzi—and their three thousand six hundred lesser kings shall each protect these Daoists, preventing any offense against them.\n\nShould you act accordingly, you shall be elevated to ascend as immortals in the realm of non-action. If you fail to aid these Daoists, assist in evil, and disrupt the true Dharma, preventing Daoists from healing and leaving their work unfulfilled—should even a single day pass with such transgressions—the Demon Kings shall all be seated and executed without mercy. Each and every decree follows the oral command of the Most High, swiftly as law and ordinance.\n\nThe Dao declares: Throughout the world, there are four hundred ninety thousand malevolent ghosts who bring lingering death upon people, spreading ten thousand kinds of pernicious qi that slay the living. Yet when Daoists recite the scriptures, their afflictions cease. Kings, too, shall come to believe in the Dao, reverently receiving the Three Caverns’ Law, and their descendants shall inherit nobility.\n\nThe Great Demon King’s prince, Wuchun Linqi, with his eight thousand myriad followers, in the years of *renwu* and *guihai*, leads ten thousand ghosts to kill. Now that they know your names, from this day forward, they must not unjustly slay the innocent. Should any among the Great Demon Kings, lesser ghosts, Huixin, or Fen Yang’s followers act thus, they shall each be executed without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *renchen* year within the Middle Kingdom, a True Lord shall appear in the world, with thirty million followers, yet only one shall preside. In that era, many men and women shall suffer illness. In the *renwu* year, he shall enter the mountains to exhort the foolish. Yet the foolish shall not believe in the Dao’s Law, nor receive the Three Caverns. Floods shall drown and slaughter, blades shall clash in war. Alas, what is to be done? Only those Daoists who receive the scriptures shall be protected by the Demon Kings, never meeting untimely death. They shall be tasked with healing the sick, and no illness shall remain uncured. Should they violate the Law even once, the Demon Kings’ heads shall shatter into eighteen pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: Many in the world are wicked, unaware of the Dao, and those who witness it do not follow—thus, many perish. Now, the Three Caverns’ Dharma Masters are revered by both humans and ghosts. From this day forward, wherever Daoists recite scriptures and pace the Dao, the Demon Kings must not disturb them. Should they disobey even once, the Ghost Kings shall be hewn by the Heavenly Axe without mercy. Swiftly, swiftly, as the oral command of the Most High, the law and ordinance decree.\n\nThe Dao declares: Let this be proclaimed to all—thirty-six Heavenly Demon Kings, the Demon Kings’ sons, and all others—reverently receive and uphold it.\n\n*The Wondrous Spell Scripture of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss, Scroll Four* concludes.\n*The Wondrous Spell Scripture of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss, Scroll Five* begins.\n\n**Chapter on the Prohibition of Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao declares: While I was in the Du Yang Palace, expounding the *Great Expulsion Scripture* to the royal daughters and guiding all beings, a Perfected One from the Central Kingdom, Tang Ping, came forth and reported: \"Of late, deaths have been rampant and disorderly, their causes unclear. From this day forward, in which year shall the plague abate?\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"From this day forward until the year *wuyin* and the year *renwu*, plague ghosts shall slay the wicked. Only by the year *jiawu* shall it cease. By the year *guiwei*, pestilential *qi* shall spread, and within the kingdom, blades and warfare shall arise—fathers and sons, rulers and ministers shall harm one another. The people shall grow ever more wicked, disbelieving in the Great Dharma. Those who receive and uphold the Three Caverns are all descended from Heaven, not born of this world.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"From this day forward, if any Daoist receives these Three Caverns scriptures, diligently practices the Way, seeks the Dao, reveres the Three Honored Ones, and saves the foolish, I shall dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers of the Ten Directions and the Thirty-Six Heavenly Mighty Ones to shield and protect them. Wherever the Dharma Master presides shall be forbidden ground. If plague ghosts do not depart, the Mighty Ones shall strike them down one after another.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"From this day forward, if any man or woman afflicted by plague hears this Dharma Master reciting the scriptures and listens with a single mind, their entire household reverently believing, then all misfortunes within and without—every malevolent spirit, mountain and forest sacrifices, cold hearths and hot hearths, and the ten thousand calamities of the household—shall be subdued of their own accord. If there are those who do not recover, disturbing and disrupting the households of the living, the Heavenly Soldiers, Mighty Ones, and the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings shall come together to execute them. I now command the Demon Kings to restrain the plague ghosts and their offspring, bidding them only to transform people and uphold this scripture. The year *jiashen* draws near, and great disaster is not far off. Daoists must strive to save the common folk.\"\n\nThe Three Great Demon Kings of the Three Heavens descend as one and swear an oath: \"From this day forward, wherever Daoists save people and perform the scriptures, if plague ghosts dare to harbor malicious intent, causing sudden illness and suffering, or bringing hardship and strife to the people and officials, I vow that my head shall shatter into eighteen pieces. Where Daoists transform people, I shall assist them; where there is illness, I shall aid in its cure. If there are disputes or legal troubles, I shall resolve them.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"From this day until the year *xinsi*, plague ghosts shall surely harm the people, and the people shall perish entirely. Alas, alas! The people of the world do not believe in the Dao and its laws. The wondrous scriptures of the Three Caverns, when their Dharma spreads, shall elevate blessings to Heaven, and the Heavenly Ones shall come to their aid—thus shall they be spared. Yet the foolish, stubborn of heart, refuse to receive them. When the disasters of *jia* and *jia* arrive, floods shall drown them. After death, their regret shall be too late. The wicked grow ever more numerous, and Heaven shall send eight hundred million Red Slayer Great Ghosts to spread pestilence and execute them. By the year *renwu*, the world shall be engulfed in great waves, and ghostly soldiers shall come to slay the wicked. Daoists shall save them, and the Heavenly Ones shall protect them, forbidding the hundred ghosts.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"During the *jiazi* decade, eight thousand Red Plague Ghosts and thirty-nine thousand more shall come to kill people. Those who know this and receive the Three Caverns from an enlightened Daoist, who recites the scriptures for them, shall naturally banish the plague ghosts. The name of the Ghost King is You Lian. His body stands thirty-seven feet tall, and in his hand he wields a red rope. Entering people’s homes, he incites quarrels and strife. From this day forward, wherever Dharma Masters perform the scriptures, he shall be forbidden.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"In the year *jiaxu*, thirty-two kinds of illness shall afflict and kill the wicked. From this day forward, wherever Dharma Masters recite the scriptures, the Three Great Demon Kings of the Three Heavens shall come to forbid them, preventing them from killing people. In the year *jiashen*, seven hundred thousand malevolent ghosts shall come to kill people. If Dharma Masters are present to save them, the Heavenly Ones shall all come to assist the Daoists in restraining the plague ghosts.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"In the year *jiawu*, eighty kinds of plague ghosts shall come to kill the wicked. The wicked do not believe in the Great Dharma and harm my Daoists, whom the Daoists cannot transform. In the years *jiachen* and *jiayin*, three hundred sixty thousand plague ghosts shall come to kill the wicked, for the wicked are many. Heaven shall dispatch Mighty Ones to descend and execute them. Daoists must swiftly transform the foolish. Yet the foolish do not believe—this is great delusion, and the deluded do not awaken. Alas! From this day forward, wherever there is plague or legal strife, I shall send the Three Great Demon Kings and the Masters of the Ten Directions to descend and execute them. Wherever this scripture of the Three Caverns is recited, wherever healing and salvation are sought, the ghosts shall be driven out and forbidden.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"The Middle Mystery: Here, the Most High expounded the scriptures, already seated in the Ninefold Chamber of the Eightfold Radiance Palace, contemplating in stillness. Which kingdom suffers or prospers? How near or far is the kalpa’s end? The multitude of beings drift aimlessly—where do they turn? The Three Calamities loom, yet the foolish remain unaware, deceiving one another, wantonly slandering, rejecting true words, and scorning the virtuous. Seeing others do good, they mock them instead. They shall enter hell, where fire chariots and sword trees await—this agony is unbearable. How can they submit? They have brought this upon themselves; no one can take their place. I now perceive all transformations and see everything—how can they not obey?\"\n\nThen, for the sake of all beings, the Great Dharma Masters, the Daoist adepts of the Three Caverns, the Immortals of the Ten Directions, the divine officials of the heavens, the great demons of the eight quarters, and the male and female demon kings of the precepts and incantations were assembled—lest the people of the world suffer unjust death. The great flood approaches, yet none know of it. The demon kings were commanded to cease their unjust harm upon the myriad families, to instruct and transform the foolish, and to cause them to receive this scripture. This scripture, the sovereign of all scriptures, contains divine transformations and divine incantations in four scrolls. The Most High expounded it for the turbid and chaotic ages to come. If, in this world, there are those with karmic affinity who encounter this scripture, it will dispel their disasters. Those who receive it shall not be among the afflicted; heavenly beings shall come to welcome them, and they shall behold the True Lord.\n\nThe Dao declares: \"The Supreme Clarity’s Immeasurable Samadhi enables one to ascend as an immortal. The divine transformations and divine incantations subdue all demons. When Daoists receive them, they shall fear no exorcism, whether in the mountains or among men. Receiving these twenty scrolls, one need not rely on other scriptures, for this scripture swiftly grants immortality.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the men and women in attendance rejoiced greatly. Each sought to receive the scripture, rising together to ask: \"We do not yet understand—how should one receive this scripture? What offerings and rituals are required? We only wish for the Heavenly Worthy to instruct us fully. We shall uphold it faithfully, and if we come to know its ways, we shall prepare the proper offerings accordingly.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"This scripture subdues demons and eliminates all disasters. Those who receive it shall not be harassed by demonic forces and shall naturally dwell in peace. If one is entangled in official matters, stricken by illness, or long mired in suffering, with no relief for months, upon hearing or seeing this scripture, their afflictions shall dissolve of themselves, and all calamities shall vanish. Those who receive it shall have immortals attend them. They shall revere their masters as the sun and moon, and cherish the scripture as pearls and jade. First, they must sacrifice to the Five Emperors of the Primordial Beginning, then break the covenant to receive it. Only afterward shall they transmit it in accordance with the teachings. In households afflicted by illness, Daoists shall perform the scripture’s recitation. When reciting, they shall first inscribe the eight talismans and place them upon the eight gates of the household. Then, for the family conducting the recitation and the Way’s practices, all inner demons and outer [obstructions] shall scatter and perish upon hearing these divine incantations. Benevolent spirits shall aid them, and myriad blessings shall gather upon their bodies. The guardian warriors of the scripture shall naturally protect them.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"The great kalpa draws near, waters shall rise to ninety thousand [leagues], and at the convergence of the Three Calamities, demonic forces shall drive the people to their deaths. The world’s people shall perish entirely. Now, I ride the Azure Dragon, leading four hundred eighty thousand heavenly warriors and celestial soldiers to intercept the plague demons, cast down the demon kings, and descend into the world to transform and deliver the foolish, causing them to receive this scripture. Those who receive it shall have their names recorded by immortals in the Jade Register, escaping the nine perils of the water’s calamity. From this day forth, all who hear, receive, and uphold this scripture shall have forty billion heavenly soldiers and celestial warriors constantly follow them.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"Now, the people of the Middle Kingdom receive these twenty scrolls of the Divine Incantation Scripture, which shall circulate everywhere. Daoists who receive this scripture shall all ascend as immortals. Even the Hu lands shall uphold it. From this day forth, if any man or woman receives and upholds this scripture, the great armies of the ten directions shall guard it, and eight hundred million warriors shall protect the scripture’s masters and recipients, ensuring they do not suffer unjust death, and that evil spirits dare not approach.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"In this turbid and chaotic age, the people are largely wicked and do not believe in the Dao and its methods. Yet if even one person hears of this, rejoices, receives, upholds, and makes offerings to it, I shall dispatch armored soldiers, celestial warriors, and forty-nine billion red cavalry from the ten directions to constantly follow them, granting them wisdom, fulfilling their heart’s desires, elevating their official ranks, and bestowing a hundred blessings naturally, delivering them from the Three Calamities and nine perils.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"The three revolutions draw near, demonic forces run rampant, and the great waters surge—do you not know this? The Most High grieves that all beings shall be ensnared within them. How can this not be sorrowful? Alas, alas! The world is turbid, its people false. Each must guide and transform, exhorting all beings to escape the three destinies. You Daoists—if you receive this scripture but do not instruct others, you shall perish. My words are not empty. The wise shall receive it and urge others to know it. From this day forth, those who receive and uphold it shall have heavenly beings protect and assist them, celestial warriors guard their gates, and the hundred evils and plague *qi* shall not disturb them.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"From this day forth, if any receive these four scrolls of the Divine Transformation and Divine Incantation Scripture, I shall dispatch armored soldiers from the ten directions, merit-recording messengers, immortal maidens, and red chariot warriors to constantly follow those who receive the scripture, ensuring no evil befalls them. When the great calamity arrives, dragons shall rise to welcome them. Those who receive this scripture shall not suffer unjust death. If one is gravely ill, they shall receive this scripture. If entangled in official matters, they shall receive this scripture. If men or women are unwell, they shall receive this scripture. If a household suffers misfortune, they shall receive this scripture. This scripture is like medicine, capable of curing all ailments. You Daoists, believe in and receive it. If you heed my words, what further concern shall I have?\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"Now, I command the demon kings of the ten directions: from this day forth, when those in illness, distress, or peril are saved by Daoists reciting this scripture, you shall protect them and not allow unjust harm. I sternly instruct the Registrar of Life and Death: where this scripture is recited, if the sick are fated to die, you shall grant them life. If their names are inscribed in the Stone Coffin or their death registers are sealed, you shall expunge them. For long illnesses or official entanglements, you shall examine and absolve them in accordance with my teachings. If any disobey my words and harm the innocent, the demon kings shall sever them into ten thousand pieces, cleaving their bodies into a thousand fragments without mercy. Beware, beware!\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"In the final revolution of the kalpa, the world shall be brief and its people wicked, with many disbelieving in the Dao. Those who receive this scripture shall escape great calamities, and immortals and jade maidens shall attend them.\"\n\nWhen the waters come in their fury, dragons shall rise to welcome them. Their ascent shall span eighty-four thousand *li* in breadth and length, and such ascents shall number four hundred and ninety thousand. As they rise to receive the people, those who are destined shall ascend without awareness of their own ascent. The world shall be vast with water, nowhere untouched—only those who have received this scripture shall escape.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year *jiāxū*, men and women of the Central Kingdom who believe in the Dao and receive this scripture, entering the mountains to refine their essence in meditation, shall be beyond count. The great assembly, hearing the scripture, rejoiced and all sought to receive it. Three hundred thousand arose as one, circumambulating the Most High seven times and bowing thrice, saying: \"We wish to receive this covenant.\" The Most High replied: \"Excellent, excellent! I shall bestow it upon you.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: In this age of the Five Turbidities, people die unjustly in great numbers, and none believe in the Dao. Ghostly soldiers drive them away, and great disasters draw near, yet the foolish remain unaware. If you can receive and venerate these twenty scrolls of scripture, when the great flood comes, immortals shall come to welcome you, and you shall have no fear of death. If you trust my words, what cause have I for worry?\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, those who receive my scriptural covenant shall have divine spirits assist them. Their households shall be naturally protected, and no evil shall befall them. You, the Daoist priests, must believe this and exhort all, that even the foolish may escape the Three Disasters. If any receive and uphold this scripture yet fail to cross the Three Rivers, I shall not be called a sage, nor shall I remain in this world to transform it.\n\nI solemnly command the great deities of the ten directions, all malevolent ghosts, demon kings, and evil spirits: From this day forward, wherever this scripture is recited, all illnesses shall be cured, and official entanglements resolved. Those who receive this scripture shall have their ten thousand wishes fulfilled.\n\nThe great assembly, hearing the scripture, rejoiced, and each received the covenant to practice it.\n\nThe Dao declares: You, the Daoist priests, need only receive these twenty scrolls of the *Divine Incantation Scripture*, and you too shall attain immortality. Why? Because this scripture subdues all demon kings, and benevolent spirits guard it. Those who receive this scripture—if they possess the immortal bones of past lives, descended from heaven—are no ordinary mortals. Among the men and women of the Central Kingdom and the six barbarian tribes of later generations, there shall be those who submit to its transformation. In the land of Wu and Shu, many believe in the Dao. The wise of the four directions, scattered and displaced, shall enter the mountains. In the years *jiǎshēn* and *rénchén*, the inauspicious fate shall be known. Daoist priests, diligently exhort one another and transform all beings. Those who personally receive this scripture shall have the protection of heavenly beings and shall never die unjustly.\n\nThe Dao declares: Even if you have received the *Wondrous Treasure Scripture of the Infinite Samadhi of Highest Clarity*, without receiving this scripture, you shall not attain immortality. Without receiving this scripture, you shall not be called a Daoist priest, nor shall you be able to cure the ten thousand illnesses. But if you receive this scripture and venerate it in your home, all ghosts shall submit, and in life and death, you shall receive grace. The Dao does not speak falsely—believe this.\n\nThe great and small in the assembly each sought to receive it. The Most High, moved by compassion for all, bestowed the precepts upon them. You who receive this scripture must not slight your teachers, nor disdain the scripture. Uphold it throughout your life, contemplate the spirits, and meditate upon the Dao. Thereafter, you shall ascend as immortals, welcomed by nine dragons.\n\nHearing this, the great assembly leapt with joy in their hearts, each rising in astonishment to bow thrice. The Dao declares: When you receive this scripture, you must copy its scrolls and set a date to recite it in a quiet chamber or empty dwelling, seated in a high place. On the first and fifteenth days of the month, burn incense and pay homage to the ten directions, as well as to your teacher. If the teacher has departed, bow four times in the direction of their departure. If the teacher resides with you, go and pay homage.\n\nThe assembly, having received the teaching, each bowed thrice and pledged to practice it.\n\n*The Fifth Scroll of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantation Scripture*\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantation Scripture*\n*The Vow [Chapter]*\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward until the years *jiǎxū* and *rénwǔ*, people will face widespread suffering, hardship, and death, wandering the lower realms, while the Dao’s *qi* daily grows in power. Its flourishing will center in the lands south of the Yangtze and within Han and Shu, where the Three Caverns’ teachings spread, and the six barbarian tribes perish entirely. Ghostly soldiers will run rampant, poisoning and harming the people, spreading pestilence to kill—no single region spared.\n\nFrom this day forward, those who uphold this scripture shall be protected by Heaven, and even malevolent spirits that bring omens shall be bound by my vow. All demonic essences, I shall swear against. From now on, wherever a Dharma Master saves a person, legal disputes shall be resolved, and the sick shall recover. Should they not recover, the Most High shall dispatch three hundred forty-nine thousand Heavenly Valiant Warriors to seize and banish all malevolent ghosts—male and female—beyond a thousand *li*. Where Daoists administer healing, none shall fail to recover, for the great deities of the ten directions shall aid these Dharma Masters in curing illness.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, wherever those afflicted by illness encounter a Master of the Three Caverns reciting this scripture, all plague spirits shall flee ten thousand *li*, forbidden from causing disturbance. Legal cases and imprisoned convicts shall naturally dissolve. Should any refuse to depart, I shall send a thousand myriad Heavenly Valiant Warriors and Celestial Soldiers to descend and slay you.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years *xīnsì*, *rénwǔ*, and *guǐwèi*, seventy-two kinds of disease shall ravage the world, killing the wicked. The wicked, for their disbelief in the Dao and its laws, shall be slain. From this day forward, wherever in the Middle Kingdom a Dharma Master saves the afflicted, I shall dispatch the Lords of the Nine Heavens to enforce this vow, banishing all malevolent ghosts beyond distant lands, forbidding them from harming those under the Dharma Master’s care. Swiftly, as the Most High’s decree from the Central Heaven commands! Should any disobey, the Heavenly Valiant Warriors shall descend to execute you, slaying without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, wherever a Daoist recites this scripture and practices the Dao for others, that place becomes the Most High’s Mystic Hall, where heavenly beings reside. All afflicted by legal troubles or pestilence shall recover, disputes shall cease, and prisoners shall be freed. Why? Because these are the Most High’s wondrous words, spoken from the Golden Mouth, and thus the Heavenly Valiant Warriors of the Three Heavens shall execute the plague spirits.\n\nThe Dao declares: Now, there are Dharma Masters who forsake worldly office, seeking the Three Caverns’ teachings and devoting themselves to the world. Witnessing its perils, they heal and relieve with single-minded devotion, aiding those entangled in legal troubles or illness. Such persons possess great blessings from past lives, their fortune flowing through the Middle Kingdom, destined to be reborn as teachers of all beings. Wherever I see such Dharma Masters healing and saving, I shall swear against all plague spirits—they shall not return.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, the world shall face great floods, and ghostly soldiers shall roam. In the years *jiǎxū* and *rénwǔ*, many Red Accumulation Ghosts shall spread across the Nine Provinces, twelve hundred commanderies, eighteen thousand counties, and three hundred million villages, slaughtering the good and virtuous, inflicting swift and grievous illness, causing the Most High’s true people to die unjustly. From now until the years *jiǎzǐ* and *rénchén*, calamity shall surge like ten-thousand-*zhang* waves. All these are your demonic ghosts—ancient dead generals, rulers, great ministers, lowly officials, lingering *qi*, worldly bandits, male and female [spirits of]... disasters of water, fire, blades, and warfare... wandering ghosts. When people fall into decline, these spirits vie to possess them, scheming to harm the people, seizing their reputations, craving their blood and offerings. Countless billions infest homes, manifesting strange lights, inciting disputes and legal troubles.\n\nFrom this day forward, should any refuse my words and linger in these dwellings, the Great Generals of the Ten Directions’ Slaying Ghosts—three hundred thousand strong—shall slay you, permitting no delay. Swiftly, as the Most High’s oral command! Should any refuse to depart, the Demon Kings’ *Jūliúzǐ* and their two hundred thousand followers shall shatter your heads into twelve pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: The Twelve Demon Kings of the Three Heavens’ *Jùpóqiāng*, one hundred twenty thousand strong, shall descend to the world. From this day forward, if any Red *Dīng* Fire Ghosts, each leading seventy-eight myriad followers, spread pestilence and wrongfully kill the good, the *Jiànhé* Official Soldiers—thirty-six thousand strong—shall seize and bind them, delivering them to the Nine Heavens’ prisons. Thus shall the world’s good people recover from illness, their households know peace, legal cases cease, all matters resolve, and disputes vanish. Those who seek shall attain the boundless bestowal of the Great Dao. Should you disregard my words, the Hundred-*Zhang* Ghost King shall behead you. Swiftly, as the Most High’s oral command and statutes! Should you disobey, you ghosts who harm the people, the Seven Heavenly Demon Kings shall shatter your heads into twenty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years *jiǎxū* and *rénwǔ*, there shall appear Black-Foot Ghosts, their bodies thirty-six *chǐ* tall, their eyes red and yellow. Some transform into red crows, called *Zúrì*. They spread myriad diseases, flying in flocks to alight upon roofs, inflicting swift illness. The afflicted suffer yellowing bodies, alternating chills and fever, dripping discharge, red-and-black dysentery, scorched and ashen faces. They come and go unpredictably, refusing food and drink, vomiting when they try, blood and urine flowing together. Their eyes redden, their heads ache, their sinews spasm, their hands and feet convulse—all these are the work of Black-Foot Ghosts. This ghost king is named *Dàtóulú*, leading a horde of eighty million brothers. I know your names—depart a thousand *li* at once! Should you refuse, you shall be slain without mercy. Swiftly, as the statutes command!\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, in the year *jiǎchén*, forty-nine myriad Black-Faced Ghost Kings named *Zhāngcháng* shall descend among the people, along with forty-six myriad billion followers, roaming the world to spread dysentery.\n\nShould some suffer pain in chest, back, or waist, with water flowing from their eyes, or find their food and drink obstructed—these ghosts bring poverty to households, tongues tied in want. Ghostly soldiers encircle dwellings, cling to doorways, lurk in the four directions and eight corners, snatching the young, the old, and the frail. Corpses lie scattered in ruin—all the work of these ghosts. From this day forward, should you refuse to depart, the Wrathful Spirits shall slay you, and the Ghost Kings shall not spare you: your heads shall shatter into eighty-six pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: Furthermore, two hundred thousand Red-Cord Ghosts shall come, led by a Ghost King commanding forty-nine myriad female ghosts. In spring, they seize men; in autumn, they take women; in winter, they claim the young; in summer, they harvest the old. By day, they lurk in waters; by dusk, they lie in wait near homes. They may seize livestock—oxen and horses—spreading their baleful poison, bringing poverty and incurable illness, claiming lives each day. From this day forward, flee swiftly. Should you refuse, your heads shall shatter into twelve pieces, and the Ghost Kings shall be executed.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎzǐ* decade, thirty thousand White-Bottom Ghosts shall descend, their Ghost King named *Chìdū*, roaming the world to spread seventy-eight kinds of disease—all beyond cure. They drive men to raving madness, bloody dysentery, and festering swellings; blood pours from their mouths as they die, their breath restless and unsteady. When crows and magpies circle a home, these are the ghosts. They cause sudden, violent deaths across the land, untimely and unjust, afflicting men and women with grave illness. From this day forward, you Ghost Kings, gather your ghostly troops and depart. Should you refuse, you shall die, your heads shattering into thirty-eight pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year *jiǎxū*, the Red-Cliff Ghosts shall come, their bodies eighty *zhàng* tall, forty-nine billion strong in a single horde. They transform into great fish, seven *zhàng*, two *chǐ*, and three *cùn* in length, then shift into a million flying crows, descending upon the world to spread the *qi* of sudden death. They incite warfare, fill prisons with the condemned, bring reckless slander and strife, and inflict pain upon every household. This is the vengeance of the Ghost King *Yuànzhū*—swiftly gather your troops! From this day forth, be banished ten thousand *li* away.\n\nShould you refuse to depart, your heads shall shatter into thirty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎwǔ* decade of the year, there shall come the Yellow Ox Ghosts, their Ghost King named *Chìshí*. When they gallop forth, they become red-headed crows, ninety million strong. They enter the homes of men, seizing the young, the old. They spread ten thousand kinds of illness, their *qi* of disease thick and heavy. These are the harms wrought by the Earth Lord, who calls himself *Lǐ Zǐ’áo*. *Zǐ’áo* and his brothers, a thousand thousand myriad strong, conspire to slay men, killing without reason. From this day forward, flee swiftly to other lands. Should you refuse, bringing sickness and death to men, strife to households, and blight to fields and silkworms, you shall die. Ghost King *Chìshí*, your head shall shatter into ten thousand pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎshēn* decade of the year, there shall come the Ghost Kings *Méng Tián* and *Wáng Jiǎn*, each leading thirty thousand red ghosts to traverse the world. They incite men to quarrelsome *qi*, afflict them with foul dysentery, swollen faces and eyes, fullness in the chest, vomiting, and restlessness. They cause infants to cry in terror, bring official disputes and slander, cast men into prisons, and spread a thousand illnesses and ten thousand afflictions—poverty, distress, and hardship, children who do not survive, fields and silkworms that yield no harvest, and ten thousand unfulfilled wishes. All these are the works of the Ghost Kings *Wáng Jiǎn* and his kind. From this day forth, should *Méng Tián*, *Wáng Jiǎn*, and the others fail to gather their ghostly troops, their underling ghosts shall perish utterly, and the heads of the Ghost Kings shall shatter into eighty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎxū* decade of the year, there shall come five nations of Ghost Kings, their ghostly troops the dead generals of *Sòng*, *Zhào*, *Yān*, *Wèi*, and *Lǔ*. Each king leads thirty-six thousand ghosts, roaming the lands of *Shǔ* and *Hàn*, seizing women, children, and old men from all under heaven, spreading forty-six kinds of illness to kill men. From this day forth, we know your names: Ghost King *Huáinánzǐ* has returned, along with *Bái Gōng*, *Hán Shè*, *Sòng Xiàn*, and *Wáng Shàn*. From this day forth, should you stir your underling ghosts to continue killing men, your heads shall shatter into seventy-eight pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎyín* year and decade, there shall come thirty-nine thousand ghosts, their Ghost King named *Jùliúbù*, each leading eight hundred thousand ghosts to descend and spread sixteen thousand kinds of illness, maladies beyond cure. They cause kings to falsely accuse their people, oppressing the myriad folk, leaving none whole. Neighboring states send raiders, evil ghosts enter homes, rendering dwellings uninhabitable—all these are the works of such ghosts. From this day forth, you Ghost Kings and your underling ghosts, gather your ghostly troops. Should you refuse to depart, the radiant might of the Heavenly Capital shall slay you without mercy. You must not allow the people of the world to suffer unjust death and illness—swiftly gather your ghostly legions!\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Dao declares: Should the world descend into great chaos, with floods soon to come, the people shall toil in hardship. Receive the Dao to enlighten the foolish. Ghost Kings, upon seeing you receive the scriptures of the Three Caverns, follow the teachings of the Daoist masters, and come to guard and protect, they shall not dare to encroach upon you. Daoists, strive diligently: receive the *Tàiqīng Zhōngxuán*, and a hundred ghosts shall not draw near to men. Those who receive the *Sānmèi* shall naturally attain immortality; those who receive the *Dǎohuà* shall see demon kings submit; those who receive the *Dàqū Jīng* shall be aided by heavenly beings; those who receive the *Wúliàng Pǐn* shall behold the True Lords face to face; those who receive the records of immortality shall be protected by immortals; those who receive the *Huángtíng* shall have the Most High come to them. These are the true essentials of the Three Caverns.\n\nDaoists, both men and women of worth, who receive these scriptures and practice them wherever they go, healing the illnesses of the people, shall find none that do not recover, and Ghost Kings shall submit of their own accord. Should they refuse, the Mighty Ones and *Huáng Yīng* shall strike them down one after another.\n\nThe Dao declares: The world is filled with evil men, and thus there are these evil ghosts who violently slay men. From this day forth, men and women who receive the teachings of the Three Caverns shall be revered by Ghost Kings, who shall not dare to offend them, and all people shall make offerings to them. Those who violate these Three Caverns Dharma Masters—whether by speaking ill, deceiving, reviling, scheming, striking, or plundering—shall have their bodies tormented, their descendants extinguished, and their seven generations of ancestors consigned to eternal darkness. By the oral command of the Most High:\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, those who suffer illness are your doing, you thirty-two Demon Kings, *Wūjiū* and the rest. You and your underling troops shall not spread poison to kill men. Should you refuse to depart, eight hundred million red-clad minor officials and the true riders of the Nine Heavens shall be dispatched to slay you. Swiftly gather your underling ghosts, make your ghostly troops submit, that the living may be at peace and the world be at ease. Why do you not depart? Demon Kings, your heads shall shatter into ninety pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: There are nine hundred fifty thousand minor ghosts who come to kill men. Yet those of great fortune, Daoists who receive the incantations of the Three Caverns and come to recite them, shall be aided by the Ghost Kings. The Mighty Ones shall issue commands to repel these minor ghostly bandits, reconcile the ghosts of the household, the lords of wells and hearths, the ghosts of kinship, and all others. The lingering dead within homes, ghosts from other lands, and those in households who receive no offerings—each shall be gathered and delivered to the Northern Prison of *Tiānyī* to be slain. Should you fail to heed my words, your great Demon Kings’ heads shall shatter into eighty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, should even a single person fall ill, it is entirely the work of your minor Ghost Kings. From this day forth, should a man or woman fall ill, and a Daoist come to recite scriptures and provide healing, you must swiftly depart ten thousand *li*, allowing the living to recover, and I shall promote you on high. Should they not recover, I shall hack you into ten thousand pieces without mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the oral command of the Most High, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, should even a single person fall ill, it is entirely the work of plague ghosts. The great Demon Kings have failed to exercise due care, allowing minor ghosts to kill men.\n\nFrom this day forth, the great Demon Kings and lesser kings must swiftly aid the celestial beings. Wherever Daoists recite this scripture, let the living recover from illness, and let disputes of speech and official matters dissolve of themselves. Should they not recover, the Ghost Kings shall be hacked into ten thousand pieces without mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the oral command of the Most High, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Dao declares: The world is filled with wicked men. In the year of *renwu*, when Daoists entered the mountains, they were met with mockery. Great floods came, and death arrived unknowing. Alas, alas! The Sage foresaw what was yet unseen, and thus first composed the essentials of the Three Caverns to instruct the myriad families. Those who do not use, accept, or uphold them shall flow away like mud. How grievous, how grievous! The Most High, in great compassion, acts for the sake of all beings in the ten directions.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, those who die suddenly from illness, official matters, or disputes of speech are all slain by the ghosts of Deng Hou and Liu Douwu, who also come to kill the myriad people. Heaven has dispatched the Red Thunder Generals, two hundred and eighty thousand strong, to lead the host in slaying them. From this day forth, great Demon Kings, swiftly restrain your lesser ghosts and drive them ten thousand *li* away. Should they not depart and the living remain unhealed, you shall die.\n\nSwiftly depart, swiftly, by the oral command of the Most High, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, eight hundred thousand lesser ghosts kill men. Should even one among them receive this divine incantation scripture, and a Daoist come to save them, you, lesser kings and great Demon Kings, must all come to assist, driving the lesser ghosts away in haste so that the sick may recover. Should they not recover and the illness worsen, the lesser ghosts shall die.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the oral command of the Most High, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, there are four hundred and ninety thousand wicked men. These wicked men do not recognize the Dao and its laws; hearing them, they do not believe. Now, three hundred thousand Red Slayer Ghosts shall execute them. Should even one among them have faith, celestial beings shall come to transform them. When eight thousand plague ghosts enter a dwelling to take a life, and a Daoist comes to save them, the lesser ghosts shall perish.\n\nThe Dao declares: Wicked men do not believe in the Dao and its laws; thus, the world is filled with fools. Yet when there are those who believe in the scriptures and receive the Three Caverns, they come from Heaven above. From this day forth, should the sick not recover, the great Demon Kings shall be held accountable first. From this day forth, swiftly restrain your lesser ghosts.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the oral command of the Most High, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, Daoists who uphold the Three Caverns shall first receive this divine incantation for the sake of all beings. Where there is illness and sentient beings in distress, should the celestial beings and Demon Kings not assist, you shall die.\n\nThe Dao declares: The people of the world are harassed by plague ghosts, beset by peril and distress, their lives hanging by a thread. From this day forth, wherever Daoists save lives, the great Demon Kings must swiftly ensure recovery. Should they recover, you shall be promoted on high. Should they not recover, you shall die.\n\nThe Dao declares: You Daoists, for the sake of all those in distress, hasten to go forth and save them. I shall dispatch thirty thousand celestial warriors to assist you. From this day forth, wherever Daoists save lives, celestial warriors shall protect and aid them, allowing the sick to recover. Should they recover, the celestial beings and Demon Kings shall be promoted on high. Should they not recover, you shall die.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the oral command of the Most High, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\n*Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Most High Cavern Abyss, Scroll Six* concludes.\n*Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Most High Cavern Abyss, Scroll Seven: The Chapter on Beheading Ghosts* begins.\n\nThe Dao declares: From the third to the ninth month of this renyear, the year of *renwu*, plague ghosts shall slaughter the people, taking three in every ten—a time of blade and warfare. The Six Barbarians shall perish, the Dharma of the Śramaṇas shall transform, and the qi of the Dao shall daily flourish, as the Three Caverns spread throughout the Middle Kingdom. The vast sun and moon shall lose their measure, the people shall toil in suffering, and the dead shall fill every household. If there are those who uphold the Three Caverns, converting and instructing the people to receive them, and if the sick recite the scriptures, the spirits of the scriptures shall save them, and their illness may be cured. From this day forth, wherever this scripture is recited, I shall dispatch the mighty warriors of the ten directions to transform and admonish the plague ghosts and all evil spirits, compelling them to seize these ghosts. The sick shall be spared, their illnesses cured, and no further harm shall befall them. Those imprisoned or sentenced to penal servitude shall be naturally released. Should they not receive this grace, the Demon Kings shall be the first to face judgment, and they shall be beheaded without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: After the year of *jiayin*, there shall appear thirty-six myriad and three three-legged ghosts, each nine *zhang* in height, wielding red staffs. They shall enter the homes of the people, inflicting sixty-two kinds of illness, sickening and killing the wicked. Their name is *Quyin*, and each commands three hundred and sixty vertical-eyed ghosts, their eyes all red. Some ride the winds and clouds, seizing lives wantonly, slaughtering livestock in an instant. There shall be one thousand two hundred green plague ghosts, and the plague ghosts’ brethren shall number eighty million. Male and female ghosts, nine hundred million strong, shall enter the homes of the people, lying in wait for the young, causing sudden death. There shall also be two-headed ghosts, named *Dangjin*. *Dangjin* is violent and cruel, constantly terrorizing the common folk, afflicting them with illness. These ghosts falsely devour the people’s pigs and chickens, deceitfully posing as great spirits to delude the foolish. The foolish believe them, slaughtering livestock to offer sacrifices to these ghosts. The ghosts seize the opportunity, turning it into custom. If they do not receive offerings, they cause illness and pain. From this day forth, wherever there are those who uphold this scripture, I shall dispatch thirty-nine thousand celestial soldiers to harmonize and admonish these ghosts, driving them a thousand *li* away. Should they not depart, the Great Demon Kings of the Three Heavens and the lords of the ten directions shall hack them into ten thousand pieces, and there shall be no pardon.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *renwu*, there shall already be thirty-six kinds of great ghosts, named *Black-Headed Blazing*, also called *Red Canopy*, and *Aju* as their third name. Each shall lead thirty-nine thousand followers, all wielding white staffs and ghost-slaying blades seven *chi* long. They shall enter the homes of the people, seizing lives wantonly, inflicting one hundred and twenty kinds of illness, sickening and killing the wicked. Sixty kinds of malign qi shall enter the bodies of the people, causing sudden death. From this day forth, wherever those afflicted with such illnesses find masters of the Three Caverns reciting scriptures and performing the Dao, they shall all be cured. Should the ghosts still refuse to yield, causing the people’s illnesses to persist and official matters to remain unresolved, the Great Brahmā Heavenly Kings and the lords of the ten directions shall behead them without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *renwu*, there shall already be thirty-seven thousand red crows, spreading thirty-nine thousand kinds of illness to sicken and kill the wicked. There shall also be eighty-two kinds of illness, bringing misfortune to the wicked. When afflicted by these illnesses, if there are masters of the Three Caverns reciting scriptures and performing the Dao, they may be cured. Wherever scriptures are recited and the Dao is performed, the thirty-six Brahmā Heavenly Kings shall come to assist and protect you. The armies of plague ghosts shall naturally disperse. Should they not depart, I shall dispatch the warriors of the Three Heavens and one hundred thousand *Red Ruin* soldiers to seize and behead them. Daoists who uphold the Three Caverns must swiftly convert all people to the Dao, for the celestial beings shall rejoice. Should you corrupt even one person’s good heart, the celestial beings shall punish you, and you shall not attain human form—how then could you become an immortal? From this day forth, wherever there are those who heal the sick, celestial beings shall come of their own accord to assist and protect you.\n\nThree celestial maidens, numbering five thousand myriad, shall descend together, accompanying *Magu* to roam *Duyang Mountain*, traversing the Five Marchmounts. They shall witness the people of the world suffering from illness and death, not merely a few. The Mysterious Woman exclaims in alarm: “Alas! Celestial calamity! The people shall perish entirely—how can they be saved?” Grieving together, they come to the *Mystic Capital* and report fully to the Most High. The Most High says: “Go among the people of the world and convert them all, instructing them to uphold the Three Caverns. The scriptures of the Three Caverns can deliver sentient beings from all hardships. If you all go to the lands and convert the people to the scriptures, they shall come to revere and believe. When they fall ill or face official troubles, recite the scriptures for them. After one night of recitation, the dead shall revive, and official matters shall resolve themselves. From this day forth, wherever there are masters saving the people, I shall dispatch celestial beings to transform and admonish them, and the plague ghosts shall naturally depart.”\n\nThe Dao declares: These three maidens were greatly blessed in their former lives and have now become holy women, teaching and converting all people. They are the most revered in the ten directions. They transform a hundred times in a single day, and none can match them. From now on, if people of later generations hear the names of these three maidens, these women shall also come to save them. Should they suffer from illness or official troubles, recite this scripture, and the great spirits of the ten directions shall come to their aid, preventing any misfortune. If you have the merit of converting others, Heaven shall know of it.\n\nThe Dao declares: From the year of *gengchen*, there shall already be ninety hundred million black slaying ghosts, each six *zhang* in height. Each shall lead eighty-four thousand lesser ghosts and red-headed plague ghosts to lie in wait for the people. Their name is *Yingnü*, their eyes all red. They shall roam the ten directions, entering the homes of the people to seize the young, inflicting one hundred kinds of illness to kill them. From this day forth, wherever there are masters reciting this scripture to treat illness, the plague ghosts shall swiftly depart a thousand *li* away. Should they not depart, the great spirits of the Three Heavens shall admonish them. Should they still refuse to leave, the warriors shall bind them, and there shall be no further pardon.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *renwu*, during the third and tenth months, there shall be one hundred twenty thousand red-skied plague ghosts, each leading thirty-nine thousand warrior soldiers. There shall also be seven million black-tailed ghosts, named *She She*. Each shall command eighty-six thousand, descending from above to slay the wicked. From this day forth, wherever there is dire illness, should Daoist masters perform scriptural rites to save the afflicted, these ghosts shall seize and bind them. Should they refuse to depart, the warriors of the Three Heavens shall surely behead them. In an instant, the warriors of the Nine Heavens shall also execute them, with no further pardon.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, there shall be eight hundred thousand three-legged ghosts and twelve-headed plague ghosts, coming to kill the people and inflict seventy-nine kinds of illness. Wherever there are masters of the Three Caverns performing the Dao to save others, these ghosts shall naturally be seized by the heavenly beings. Should they refuse to depart, the warriors of the Three Heavens shall surely behead them, with no pardon whatsoever.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the ninth month of the year *xinsi*, there shall be thirty million red-eyed ghosts, named *Jiaozi*, each leading forty-nine hundred million lesser ghosts to kill the people. Those afflicted by this plague must swiftly seek masters of the Three Caverns, who upon entering the home shall cause the ghosts to depart of their own accord. Should they not depart, nine hundred thousand *Tianding* warriors and celestial soldiers shall successively behead them, with no pardon whatsoever.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *jiawu*, there shall be eighty million *Xiaoling* ghosts, named *Red-Head*, each leading eight hundred thousand to descend and inflict ninety kinds of illness, afflicting the wicked with swelling, sores, and carbuncles. From this day forth, wherever there are masters treating illness, these ghosts shall submit and swiftly flee ten thousand *li* away. Should they refuse to depart, the warriors of the Three Heavens shall execute them without exception. The Daoist masters shall transform the people, causing these ghosts to depart of their own accord.\n\nThe Dao declares: From the year of *gengchen* to the ninth and tenth months of the year *renwu*, many people shall fall ill. There shall be nine million three hundred thousand yellow-bodied ghosts, named *Bai Long*, each commanding twelve thousand kings to descend and afflict the people. From this day forth, wherever masters recite the scriptures, these ghosts shall depart of their own accord. Should they refuse to leave, the *Tianding*, celestial warriors, and the great armies of the Three Heavens shall join to behead them, and the Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens shall punish them.\n\nThe Dao declares: From the years *xinsi* and *renwu* onward, there shall be ninety-six kinds of slaying ghosts coming to kill the people. In every village, there shall be four hundred sixty thousand yellow-plague ghosts entering the settlements, causing people to vomit blood, suffer from dysentery and cholera, sudden heart pain, jaundice, throat obstructions, and even death. Wherever there are masters performing scriptural rites to save the afflicted, the great spirits of the Three Heavens shall harmonize and admonish these ghosts, banishing them to distant lands ten thousand *li* away. Should any refuse to depart, their heads shall be shattered into sixteen pieces. The great armies of the Three Heavens and the warriors of the Nine Heavens shall never spare them. The Daoist masters shall transform the people and admonish the ghosts.\n\nThe Dao declares: Since the end of the Great Han, there have been five great *wutong* ghosts, named Wang Jian, Bai Qi, Han Zhang, Le Yang, and Chu Kuang. There are also Hao Jing, Nü Wa, and Zhu Rong, thirty-nine thousand in number, each commanding eight hundred million. These ghosts, since the time of Fu Xi, have overseen emperors, ministers, and generals, with this great ghost host commanding twelve thousand. The lesser ghosts of the world rely on them for sustenance, serving as soldiers for their ghost kings to harass and disturb the people, bringing them suffering. They lurk in households, seizing men and women, causing illness, sudden misfortune, slander, legal troubles, fires, and floods. Countless in number, they wrong the good people, killing the innocent, deceiving and driving away family, hastening the Stove Lord, disturbing the household spirits, obstructing every matter, and inflicting myriad illnesses, swift and severe. Riding the wind and mounting sparrows, they recklessly create strange lights and omens. Since recent times, their offenses have been beyond count. Now, the *Zhengyi Gongcao*, the *Daming* Envoys, and the *Yanshen* Envoys, each leading nine hundred million iron-faced cavalry officers wielding great halberds and ghost-slaying implements, shall descend together with the forty-nine thousand mighty warriors of the Most High. They shall capture and execute the dead generals of this land, all demons and evil spirits, the millions of specters, and all inauspicious omens that come to harm the households of the living. Each shall be seized, bound, and slain, purging the households of slaying ghosts. The ghost kings shall all exert their strength to successively bind them. Should any ghost refuse to depart, the ghost kings shall execute them a thousand times without pardon. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the land, there are great ghost lords such as Deng Ai, Zhong Shiji, Zhao Shan, Wang Mang, Li Ao, Du Zhou, Liu Douwu, Wang Li, Xiahou Ying, Jiang Gongyan, Ye Gongli of Nanyang, Xia Tanzhi, Xiao He, Shentu Bo, Han Xin, Tian Jin, Liang Hong, Gao Pei, Sun Wen, Sima Jiong, and Liu Yuanda. These great ghosts command the people of the world. Some have temples dedicated to Emperor Wu and King Wen, with continuous offerings and unceasing sacrifices. Each commands armies to haunt the people of the world, afflicting them with illness and death, year after year, month after month, inflicting thousands of kinds of illness. Some cause heaviness in the limbs, alternating chills and fever, dysentery, swelling, watery distension, blackened diseases, pain in the head and eyes, burning heat in the chest and back. Some bring jaundice, coughing, and throat obstructions. All manner of illnesses kill people without measure.\n\nThe Dao declares: These individuals were all once great generals and officials who, after their deaths, had temples built and were continuously worshipped.\n\nNow a hundred ghosts cling to them, amassing into vast hordes, ever lying in wait for the chance to seize a human form and slaughter the common folk. They bring upon people disasters of water and fire, strife of words and tongues, and ten thousand misfortunes of official entanglements. When calamity strikes, it swiftly kills, and many lives are lost—this has occurred time and again.\n\nNow the Red Cinnabar Great Prohibiting Soldiers are dispatched, their bodies ten thousand *zhang* tall, eight hundred thousand in number, each leading three hundred million troops, descending to capture these ghost-kings. Once seized, they are beheaded without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: Wherever the Three Caverns’ Dharma Masters recite scriptures to save people, ninety trillion divine soldiers shall be commanded to guard the households of the living, protecting every member within. Should there be illness, official disputes, or imprisonment, each shall be resolved and freed, their ailments cured without further harm. On the day they recover, the ghost-kings shall ascend. If they do not recover and remain in peril, the Great Demon Kings Mao Di and others shall have their heads shattered into ninety fragments.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, when there are the sick or where this divine incantation scripture is recited, forty thousand Valiant Harmonious Force Soldiers and three hundred sixty thousand Hundred-Tongued Officers shall be dispatched to the homes of the afflicted and the imprisoned. They shall mediate and reconcile the sufferer’s kin, their great-grandparents, and all internal and external misfortunes—whether those who have made offerings or those who have not—distinguishing and resolving each matter clearly.\n\nMoreover, the ghosts of prisons and punishments—Gaoyao, the Lords of Wooden Shackles, the Twelve Commanding Officers, eight hundred ninety thousand generals, all the Long-Hou officials, the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers, the high and low ministers, and the overseers of the ten directions—shall swiftly open the gates of the prisons, release the incarcerated, and transform their fates through reconciliation, bringing joy to the rulers of the age. Freed, they shall depart, and the deceased shall ascend, escaping the Three Wretched Paths to join the ranks of Daoist ghosts, roaming freely and without care, aiding and benefiting the living. Illnesses shall be cured, and all matters resolved.\n\nFrom this day forth, We have rendered judgment with the ghost-kings: should any remain unhealed, the Great Demon Kings Li Hong and others shall have their heads shattered into three thousand five hundred fragments.\n\nThe Dao declares: I address the Great Demon King Fu Ren: Now there are the living, afflicted by illness and suffering. Their four limbs and eight bodily parts are stricken, their mouths and throats obstructed. Their heads ache, their eyes blur, and their chests and backs burn with pain.\n\nTheir limbs grow stiff and unyielding, their five viscera scorched. Qi assails the heart in sorrow, leaving them listless and joyless, their eyes unable to open. They refuse food and drink, only retching in nausea. Their dreams and waking hours are restless, as if pursued by the dead. Both within and without, from the greatest to the smallest, all fear their lives may not be preserved. The hour of death approaches swiftly, drawing near without delay.\n\nNow, with sincere devotion and pitiable sorrow, We dispatch the Great Slayer, the Marquis-Kings, and their vast armies—eighty million strong—to summon the ghostly legions of the underworld. For those afflicted by illness in the homes of the living: what ghosts are these? If they be the great-grandparents of the living, they ought not to haunt them. If they are not among those properly worshipped, they are bound by their own attachments. If they be earth or hearth spirits, their sacrifices are observed in due season. If they be household ghosts, they ought not to harm the living. In this age of clarity and fortune, ghosts may not come wantonly.\n\nIf there be lingering qi of old misfortune in the dwelling, or calamities from the four directions, all malevolent ghosts—those of mountains, forests, marshes, and pools—shall be seized and delivered to the Three Heavenly Hells. There, the *Ghost Laws* and the *Nüqing Ordinance* shall judge them, ensuring they may not afflict the good with sudden illness.\n\nFrom this day forth, swiftly gather your ghostly minions. Should the living remain unhealed or their legal troubles unresolved, the Great Demon Kings shall execute them with a thousand cuts, showing no mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎzǐ* decade of years, eight hundred thousand red-sickness ghosts slay the living. Thirty-six myriad black ghosts and ghost-kings, each leading one hundred twenty thousand barbarian ghosts, invade the homes of men, bringing chills and fevers, swelling of the limbs, and burning heat. They cause infants and women in childbirth to die suddenly.\n\nThe Three Dukes shall punish themselves; the realm shall fall into chaos, with floods and droughts unbalanced. Cruel ghosts shall come only to seize men. The sovereign shall fall ill, seated amid unjust oppression, while the people wail to heaven. Heaven, enraged, shall dispatch thirty thousand black-faced lesser ghosts to slay the living.\n\nIf you wish to escape this ghostly suffering, receive the Three Caverns’ true scriptures. Should one accept the register of a single general, ghosts shall not dare to kill wantonly.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the home of the afflicted, if there be those ensnared in prisons, fearing death, first establish this fast. Let the officiants—whether three, five, ten, or eight—prepare fine registers and accounts. In a purified chamber, arrange the Three Treasures, incense, lamps, and offerings, ensuring all is clean and complete. Summon the masters of the Three Caverns.\n\nAmong the masters, choose one of keen and lucid understanding to serve as the officiating priest, chanting the Dao with the host. Set up two high thrones, where one shall intone the sacred titles on behalf of the host. The remaining Daoists shall circumambulate in order. The master upon the high throne shall hold the *Step of Emptiness*, chanting in harmony, while those below move slowly in procession. Gaze upward to the heavens, listening for the wild cries in the clouds. If you hear a clear, ringing resonance, it shall resemble the songs of the Heavenly People in the Palaces of Dark Radiance.\n\nThe Dao declares: Where this scripture is recited in the home of the afflicted, all Great Demon Kings and lesser ghost-kings shall swear: From this day forth, should any perform the fast and conduct the rites to heal the sick—even those in grave peril, beset by legal strife, imprisonment, or torture—summon the myriad ghosts before them. Which ghost is responsible? Drive them swiftly away, that the afflicted may naturally recover, their legal troubles resolved, and all their wishes fulfilled.\n\nFrom this day forward, should legal troubles remain unresolved or illnesses persist, the Great Demon Kings and lesser ghost-kings shall execute them without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎxū* decade of years, three thousand nine hundred white crows shall descend, spreading sickness and slaying the wicked. Throughout the land, men and women shall die suddenly, struck by eighty kinds of pestilential qi. The ancient dead generals Meng Da, Ma Yuan, Li Qing, Wang Feng, Yan Zhen, Zuo Qiu, thieves, fishermen, Hua Yuanji, Cheng Hong, and others—each leading a thousand myriad—shall descend to spread red dysentery, sapping the strength of the living and unsettling their homes. They shall lurk at doors and thresholds, seizing the young.\n\nShould the kin of a household take fright, and their kin in turn fear them, then official ranks shall not advance, households shall suffer depletion, groundless quarrels shall arise, every encounter shall turn inauspicious, legal troubles shall follow one after another, imprisonment shall drag on, fields and silkworms shall yield nothing, and ten thousand wishes shall come to naught. All this stems from these ghost-kings failing to restrain their underlings, allowing them to torment the living thus.\n\nFrom this day forward, each of you shall keep your ghostly troops in check and forbid their cruelty. Let the living see their legal troubles resolved and their illnesses ease. On the day their illnesses ease, you shall ascend. Should they fail to recover even for a day, you shall be executed ten thousand times over, your heads shattered into eighty-six pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎshēn* decade of years, great disasters shall arise. Waters from the northwest shall surge forth, and of ten stricken by illness, eight or nine shall die. Thirty-nine myriad red ghosts shall descend, spreading sickness among the people. Those afflicted shall turn sallow, and women and children shall be especially unfit to bear it. Yet should the ruler of the land believe in the Dao, uphold the scriptures, and receive them, they shall be spared. Pestilential qi shall billow forth, and thirty-nine myriad kinds of illness shall slay the people. Those who flee into the mountains shall number thousands upon thousands. The people shall know no peace, cut down by blades, plagues, and ghostly slaughter—killed without reason.\n\nHeaven shall dispatch seven hundred thousand red-clad soldiers, each wielding a bronze halberd, to slay the wayward ghosts and gather all the world’s calamities. Should the Three Heavens’ Great Demon Kings wrongfully execute any, each of those demon kings—Wūwán and the rest—shall be executed without mercy. Begone ten thousand leagues hence!\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in statute and command!\n\nThe Dao declares: The world teems with wicked men, and Heaven dispatches warriors to execute them, first inquiring into their good and evil. How could the vast hosts of Heaven’s soldiers be resisted? Yet should Daoist priests recite scriptures to save them, let them live, and cease the slaughter.\n\nFrom this day forward, should any in the world suffer illness or imprisonment, wherever Daoist priests perform petitions and recite scriptures to heal them, the Great Demon Kings and lesser ghost-kings shall aid in their recovery, resolving all matters. Should any fail to recover or be released, and quarrels persist unbroken, the great ghost Yìzhēn and his kind shall hack them into ten thousand pieces, without exception or mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the Most High’s oral command and statute!\n\nThe Dao declares: The great gate’s ghostly officer, Lord Dàzhēn; the small gate’s ghostly officer, Lord Xiǎozhēn; the chamber’s guardian, Yī Wén; the rear guardian, Wàn Lún; the hearth’s guardian, Yán Jǐng; the road’s guardian, Shī Gòng; the great ghosts within and without; the household’s calamities; the male and female guests who perished; those slain by water, fire, metal, or wood—each shall restrain themselves. What ghost now comes to sicken the living? The people are in peril.\n\nThe Most High dispatches a hundred million red-clad soldiers, warriors who bind ghosts and beat them to death with bronze cudgels, then deliver them to the Warding Off Evil?—handing them over to the Heavenly One’s Northern Prison. Fearing wrongful harm, He commands that all the people be instructed: should any household suffer illness, swiftly release the afflicted. Let them be treated according to the Dao, that the living may recover and neither people nor ghosts come to harm. Should any ghost refuse to depart, the sick shall not recover. The Great Demon Kings and lesser ghost-kings shall be hacked into a hundred pieces, without mercy.\n\nAll as in the Most High’s oral command—no delay permitted!\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in statute and command!\n\nThe Dao declares: Nowadays, the world’s people die wretchedly from pestilence. From this day forward, We swear with the demon kings Xià Yín, Wūwán, Wū Yán, Chì Bō, Hóng Qiū, and others: In this age, sickness abounds, and sinners die unaware, ignorant of their own salvation. We now command the Three Caverns’ Dharma Masters to enlighten the foolish. Among the foolish, there shall be those who believe—men and women of office. Should they hold to these incantations, observe fasts and lectures in their villages, practice the Six Periods’ rituals, perform the Dao, give alms, and meditate, then in such places, you ghost-kings shall aid in enlightening the foolish. Do not let them fall ill; should they fall ill, let them recover swiftly, and permit no hundred evils to assail them.\n\nAll as We have spoken—you may ascend. Should you defy Our teaching, your heads shall be shattered into ten pieces, without mercy.\n\nAll as in the Most High’s oral command and statute!\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiǎ-wǔ* decade of years, the six barbarian tribes—Dī, Liáo, Qiāng, and Hú—shall unleash their ghosts to roam, spreading sixteen thousand kinds of disease to sicken and slay the wicked. Great disasters shall bring unrest; the people shall face peril and plague, and many women shall die. The ghost-king Dèng Ài and Liú Dǒu-Wū shall come, spreading twelve kinds of dysentery. The Earth Lord shall kill men, and the divine dragons shall ascend to heaven. Great floods shall rise, and the Five Phases shall cease their motion. Ghostly bandits shall harm the people, causing many to die violently, perishing without reason.\n\nFrom this day forth, the Most High and the Great Demon Kings—thirty-six kings, including Xún Gǔ, and one hundred twenty thousand ghost-lords—shall decree: If any household, man or woman, falls ill, you shall drive away the affliction, dissolve official disputes, and restore peace to the people. Should you fail even once to act according to the law, you shall be beheaded first, your bodies shattered into ten thousand pieces without mercy.\n\nAll as in the oral command and statute of the *Nǚ Qīng Sháo Shū*.\n\nThe Dao speaks: As the great celestial cycles converge, demonic soldiers shall run rampant. From this day forth, for all under heaven—men and women whose illnesses linger and deepen, all evil ghosts and household spirits who fail to protect them, and those harmed by the hundred evils of mountains and forests—you shall ensure their swift recovery and spare them unjust death. If, from this day forth, any cause unjust death or untimely demise, the Great Demon King and lesser ghost-kings shall sever your heads into ten thousand pieces to atone for these wrongs.\n\nAs the Most High has orally commanded, there shall be no mercy. All shall be as the *Ghost Statutes* decree: seize them and deliver them to the Northern Prison of Heaven One for punishment. Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this day forth, eight hundred thousand three-legged ghosts and twelve-headed plague ghosts shall come to kill, spreading seventy-nine kinds of disease. If the afflicted receive the rites of the Three Caverns’ Dharma Masters, these ghosts shall be seized by the heavenly beings and taken away. Should they refuse to depart, the celestial enforcers of the Three Heavens shall surely behead them.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Within the Three Realms, the Great Demon King commands thirty-six lesser kings, each ruling forty-eight billion lesser kings, who in turn command countless great soldiers. They roam the world under Our oath: to govern the common folk justly, never to wrongfully harm the innocent, nor bring misfortune through malevolent haunting. From this day forth, wherever there is urgent illness, official peril, or distress, you shall attend to them, lend your power to their fortune, resolve disputes, and ensure that rulers, ministers, and all evil ghosts are made joyful. Let illness be cured, official matters resolved, clans harmonious, the realm at peace, the Five Grains abundant, rulers and people rejoicing, demonic soldiers subdued, and all free from sickness and pain, with every wish fulfilled.\n\nShould you achieve this, the ghost-kings shall ascend, and all heavenly beings shall rejoice. But if you allow untimely winds and rains, failed harvests, unrest among the people, tyranny from rulers, unresolved disputes, or unhealed illness, then you, the Great Demon Kings and their consorts, along with the hundred billion ghost-kings, shall all be beheaded.\n\nThus concludes *Scroll Seven of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra*.\n*Scroll Eight of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra* begins.\n\n**Summoning Ghosts Chapter**\n\nThe Dao spoke: Within the Three Realms, those who believe in the sutras are rare indeed. Thus, worthy persons are not born, and many evil people gather and multiply. When there are those who believe in the Dharma and uphold the sutras, they come from Heaven above. The calamity of *jiashen* brings Heaven’s welcome to the Daoists. It does not welcome sinners, for sinners do not believe in the Dharma and are thus not received.\n\nIn the years *renwu* and *gengchen*, plague ghosts and weapons will slaughter people, leaving few alive in the world. During times of illness, if a Master of the Three Caverns performs the turning of sutras and the Daoist rites, the Heavenly Worthy will summon the great deities of the ten directions, causing sickness to be cured and official matters to resolve themselves. Should they disobey this command, the ghost-kings shall be the first to be punished.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the year *xinsi*, there will be a ghost named *Duluna*, standing three *zhang* tall, with eyes slanting and mouth askew, ears six *cun* long, wielding an iron staff. It will roam among people, striking down the wicked. Plagues, epidemics, and official troubles will be accompanied by sixty-nine thousand ghosts. Some will take the form of great crows; where these crows pass, people will all fall ill and die, beyond cure. By the year *renchen*, the people will be greatly afflicted, and by *jiashen*, they will perish entirely. If the kingdom’s Dharma Masters can govern this, performing the turning of sutras and Daoist rites, the great armies of the Three Heavens will come to protect them, sparing them from harm.\n\nDaoists transform people, causing them to receive the Three Caverns’ sutras. The Dao spoke: As *jiashen* approaches, ghostly soldiers will slaughter people, and forty-nine thousand *Wuxuan* warriors will traverse the realm. Wherever a Master of the Three Caverns turns the sutras and practices the rites of the Three and Five, each will be guarded, preventing evil ghosts from drawing near. Evil ghosts will flee far away, aiding the Daoist in enlightening the foolish. If kings, emperors, regional lords, officials of two thousand *shi*, magistrates, nobles, or common folk uphold the Three Caverns, they shall later obtain great blessings, their fortune extending to their descendants for generations without end. They will be born among heavenly beings and humans, always encountering sages, never becoming the poor, and never forsaken by emperors, ever assisting the sovereign.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the world’s wicked places, good people are not born. If there are now noble and virtuous people, they come from Heaven above. Why is this? Evil people do not believe in the Great Dharma, nor do they understand the sutras’ words. Though they may have been born human, their past lives held little fortune, and now, though they are nobles with wealth, they do not recognize the Dharma’s canon, having no affinity with it. These are sinners indeed. I know this well: worldly official glory is like morning dew—when the sun rises, it dries up. Glory does not last long; in an instant, one dies. It is better to study immortality, which stands firm for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Daoists transform people, causing them to uphold the Three Caverns, and soon they will ascend. If there are illnesses or official troubles, turning the sutras brings great fortune. Wherever this is done, plague ghosts will die of themselves. Exert yourselves to encourage one another.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Since the year *wuyin*, there has been a great ghost with a red nose, named *Fuzi*, nine *chi* tall, with three faces and one eye. There is also a ghost with two heads and one body, three *chi* tall, each with red eyes. Another ghost, named *Daye*, has three heads and one body, seven *chi* tall. Countless in number, they wield white blades, roaming the world to seize children. They travel among the clouds, their bloated forms emitting red *qi*, causing people to suffer chills and fever, vomiting blood, heart distension, and broken *qi* in the ribs. At such times, if a Master of the Three Caverns comes to turn the sutras, the sick will recover, and official matters will resolve themselves. If they do not recover, the ghost-kings shall be the first to be punished.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From now until the year *gengchen*, there will be thirty-six thousand evil ghosts named *Tianchi*, accompanied by thirty thousand followers, roaming the world and wrongfully killing the good. By the year *renwu*, another three thousand nine hundred red-headed ghosts, named *Datou*, will descend to slaughter people. Weapons will clash throughout the world—it cannot be endured for long. Disasters and rebellions will arise in all directions, and the Six Barbarians will perish entirely. The Daoist Dharma will flourish, while the secular world will decline. In the year *jiashen*, the people will die out.\n\nTo know how to survive these calamities, only those who uphold the Three Caverns, revere their masters, and honor the sutras will be protected by heavenly deities and thus ascend to Heaven, where heavenly beings will welcome them.\n\nThe Dao spoke: By the year *renwu*, the world will be in turmoil. The common people will suffer hardship, and the Six Barbarians will invade one another. The people will be restless, and men and women will flee in chaos. The lands of Shu and Han will be vast, and the people will suddenly perish. Daoists will enter the mountains to cultivate the Three Caverns and meet the Perfected Lords. The Perfected Lords are not far off—this will occur between *renchen* and *renwu*.\n\nFrom now on, Heaven will slay the foolish, but Daoists will save them, preserving their lives. The Dao spoke: In the year *renwu*, there will be eighty thousand lowly ghosts named *Dadan*, each three *chi* and six *cun* tall, accompanied by thirty-nine billion companions. They will wield red staffs, roaming among people to kill the wicked. There will also be white crows, as large as cartwheels, flying in the millions. They will enter people’s homes and kill their children. If people see them, or if large fish die in the water and people eat them, they will die. If deer die in the wilderness and people eat them, they too will die. Daoists who uphold this sutra and teach others will prevent heavenly beings from violating these prohibitions.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The world’s fate is nearing its end, and the waters will soon rise. Men and women will all perish, except for those who uphold the Three Caverns—they alone will be preserved. From now on, wherever Daoists save people from official troubles and illnesses, four hundred thousand heavenly maidens will descend to assist, sparing them from misfortune. Daoists, diligently transform the people.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The great kalpa is approaching, and the people are mostly foolish, unaware of the coming disasters. Daoists who first see this text must urgently transform the people, causing them to enter the Three Caverns.\n\nThe followers of the Three Caverns will be welcomed by heavenly beings—this sacred teaching does not speak in vain.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The great kalpa draws near, and the people will undergo transformation. Heaven and earth were established, and Daoists transform the people. Those who do not believe differ not from the six livestock. The Most High pities you, moved by compassion. Alas, alas! Sentient beings, deluded and attached, do not seek liberation on their own; clinging to ignorance until death, what can be done for them? Summon the great deities of the ten directions and the Daoists of the Three Caverns to transform the foolish, that they may know the scriptural Dharma—such merit is boundless.\n\nIf Daoists enter the mountains to still their minds but do not transform others, this is without merit. The Dao spoke: If Daoists wish to deliver themselves, they should enter the renowned mountains. Those who wish to deliver all people should remain among the foolish, that they may be liberated. If Daoists enter the mountains, the mountain paths are profoundly remote, and worldly people will not see them, left without refuge. Though their original intention remains, there is no means to deliver others. Thus, wise Daoists need not remain in the mountains.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Unless one is a Dharma Master of the Three Caverns, one must not recklessly recite this sutra. Why is this so?\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\nWithin this sutra are recorded the names of all great demon kings who slay ghosts and govern the people. Those who receive this scriptural Dharma shall themselves attain deliverance, each storing it in a single casket. Should any suffer official disputes, imprisonment, grave illness, or prolonged affliction, perform a one-day-and-night purification rite, and I shall summon the hundred ghosts to interrogate them, that the sick may recover before they are released.\n\nYou Daoists, diligently transform the myriad people. Wherever a Daoist who has received the scriptures treats illness, the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings shall assist in healing. When the sick recover, you shall ascend in rank, and I shall never fail my word. From this day forward, I make this covenant with you, the great demon kings.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this jiǎchén year onward, three hundred sixty thousand black ghosts shall spread dysentery and bloody flux, and ghostly children shall come by night to slay men. The ghosts of the Six Barbarians, numbering in the millions, often take the forms of women or elders, entering homes to seize infants and causing livestock to die suddenly. The state neglects its people, and the populace scatters. High ministers and petty officials wrongfully take lives. In such times, ghostly soldiers bring chaos and disease.\n\nYou Daoists, simply perform the rites and recite the scriptures for one day and one night. I shall dispatch three hundred sixty thousand celestial soldiers from the Three Heavens to summon the ghosts of the ten directions and question them. Which ghosts afflict the people? Each shall be examined, and good and evil separated. The celestial soldiers shall execute them, exterminating their kindred, and show no mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The mountain and forest ghosts, named Xuánzǐdū, command twenty-nine million ghosts. They commonly cause sudden death, slaying infants and elders, entering homes to frighten chickens, dogs, and children. There are also thirty-nine thousand red-turbaned ghosts who enter homes to seize livestock. Further, eighty thousand green insect ghosts—each three feet six inches tall—constantly wield heavenly fire to burn homes, bringing official disputes and slander upon the inhabitants. There are also the great moving green ghosts, forty-nine thousand in number, each three *zhàng* tall, who wield red staffs to bludgeon the people to death.\n\nThose who are virtuous and faithful to the Dharma shall not be harmed. But the wicked—those who lack righteousness, kill living beings, defy the Dao, neglect their parents, deceive Daoists, or revile masters and disciples—shall be executed without mercy and consigned to hell. Some shall suffer incurable illness, myriad calamities converging upon them, their agony beyond words. If Daoists do not intervene, their aid shall be of no avail.\n\nThe Dao spoke: These wicked ones disrespect their masters, defy the Dharma, slander Daoists, seclude themselves to revile their teachers, and utter their masters’ names. Their sins are grave; they shall be dragged into the Red Sand Hell, where they shall remain for ten thousand kalpas. Upon release, they shall become field-protecting crows, ever dwelling in water to guard ten thousand *qǐng* of fields. Or, before death, they shall suffer illness and torment, pain clinging to their bodies, their fields and silkworms failing, their endeavors unfulfilled, and all shall mock them. These afflictions are the retribution for their past lives’ revilement of masters and disciples.\n\nFrom this day forward, should such people exist, the great demon kings shall swiftly punish them. Those who disrespect masters and disciples or do not uphold the Three Caverns shall be bound and executed without mercy by the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings.\n\nThe Dao spoke: You Daoists, in serving your masters, must be single-minded. If your hearts remain unchanged, you bring suffering upon yourselves. To slight or revile your masters is to commit the five rebellions and be unfilial, to slander the common folk, forcibly seize their wealth, teach others to do evil, or incite litigation and murder. Such people shall be seized by the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings of the Three Caverns’ scriptures and bound in the Three Heavenly Prisons. Their three *hún* and seven *pò* shall be tormented—women’s fourteen *pò* likewise—so they endure every suffering, desiring death yet unable to attain it.\n\nYou Daoists, both men and women, must deeply guard yourselves.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the jiǎyín decade, thirty-nine thousand people shall be executed in the great purge for disrespecting their masters, wrongfully taking lives, slandering Daoists, or pointing out their masters’ names. Such people shall fall into the great purgation of blade, flood, and fire.\n\nYou Daoists and all worldly people must wholeheartedly honor masters and disciples, receive the Three Caverns’ scriptures, transform all beings, and heal the afflicted. In households where illness persists, recite the scriptures to treat them. I shall summon the great ghosts of the ten directions and all deities to question them. If they remain defiant, causing households to suffer incurable illness, unresolved official disputes, or death, the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings shall hack your bodies into ten thousand pieces without mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Daoists serving their masters must revere them as heaven, visiting at the four seasons and eight solar terms to inquire after their well-being. When worldly people face matters, they must act in accordance with the Dharma. If they no longer follow their masters, and their masters no longer attend them, the spirits shall not abide with them. Among people, none are greater than masters; masters are supreme and must be honored as parents. Those who slight them shall be punished by heaven and men, and the demon kings shall not save such sinners.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Daoists who defy their masters shall be examined by celestial soldiers, and their descendants shall likewise fall among the ranks of common ghosts. In the gēngshēn and rénwǔ years, Daoists who slight their masters shall be executed by three hundred sixty thousand ghostly soldiers. Further, in the yǐsì year, forty-nine thousand red-nosed ghosts shall slay three hundred ninety thousand wicked people across the land. By the guǐsì year and rényín epoch, those who do not believe in the Dao or receive its scriptures shall fall into the eighteen purgations.\n\nThe wrongfully dead number thirty-nine thousand each day, yet the Most High distinguishes their fates accordingly. Should pestilence strike the land in any given year, Daoists who heal the afflicted shall see them recover. If they do not recover, the demon kings Nalü and their ilk shall rend such Daoists limb from limb, showing no mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forth, male and female Daoists must diligently convert the foolish of the world, urging them to receive the great scriptures of the Three Caverns. Let every person receive talismans and registers, wear their name-contracts upon their bodies, and be recorded in the Jade Calendar. Masters and disciples shall transmit the teachings in succession, allowing no disrespect. Should any violate this covenant, celestial soldiers shall execute them, annihilating their households and consigning them to plague and pestilence, where regret shall come too late.\n\nI now dispatch thirty-six thousand crimson riders, each wielding an iron staff, to traverse the land and seize the unrighteous and the five-fold traitors. If the sick are treated by Daoists, the ghost kings shall pardon them. Should they refuse, these ghost kings shall be demoted and punished without leniency.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the rénxū and guǐhài years, eight thousand punishing ghosts shall slay those who fail to honor the Great Dao. By the guǐwèi and jiǎchén years, one hundred twenty thousand red ghosts shall slaughter with blades and warfare—half for mocking those who receive the Dao, disturbing the hearts of others, assaulting Daoists, denying the power of the Dao, speaking falsely while harboring deceit, and slandering masters and disciples. Such sinners shall be cast into the Boiling Ash Hell, the Knife Mountain and Sword Tree, with no hope of release.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the jǐmǎo, bǐngyín, and dīnghài years, eight thousand shall die unjustly. This befalls those who disobey the Dao’s laws, withhold celestial taxes, break vows without repayment, make empty promises, deceive ghosts and spirits to seize others’ wealth, perform no meritorious deeds, and neglect fasting and purification. Though they be Daoists, they kindle no incense, attend no rites, ignore others’ distress, and act greedily without aid. When preparing meals for their masters, they offer impure or inadequate food, or withhold it entirely. Such people shall be cast into the Great Purgation’s Water Prison, trapped for ten thousand kalpas. Even if reborn, their six senses shall be incomplete, repelling others, reduced to the level of livestock. The Great Purgation shall execute them, and the demon kings shall offer no salvation.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Great Patriarchal Masters traverse the world, witnessing the multitude’s ignorance, and thus expound the great scriptures of Samādhi. These scriptures comprise twenty scrolls, transmitted by the Most High. Those who receive them shall behold the Most High face-to-face. Without receiving the divine incantations, none may enter the mountains, nor be called true Daoists, nor heal the sick.\n\nFrom this day forth, masters must first receive these scriptures, for they subdue all great demon kings, lesser ghost kings, and their wives and descendants—all aiding Daoists in converting people and healing the sick. Why? Because all demon kings, too, assist the Most High in transforming the myriad families. Let the wise and virtuous ponder my words.\n\nThe Dao spoke: You people of later generations, failing to honor the Great Dao, instead follow vulgar masters who beat drums to sacrifice to spirits, slaughtering pigs, dogs, and chickens, offering the three pure animals and grass upon the waters, summoning a hundred ghosts, and worshipping wild deities. Such practices breed chaos and evil; the spirits shall not protect you. Your kin shall be struck down, condemned by the Three Officials, subjected to myriad tortures. The dead shall not rest, returning to claim the living, causing deaths great and small, and ultimately annihilating your households. Do not blame the Dao.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Households that honor the Dao must do so with wholehearted devotion. In all endeavors, direct your thoughts single-mindedly toward the Dao. Conduct rites, burn incense, and perform the ten thousand offerings, guided by your master’s fasting and understanding. Do not invite vulgar masters or those who practice heterodox sacrifices into your homes, lest chaos arise, household spirits grow restless, and the living be punished. Such people shall grow wicked, and their families shall be destroyed. This, too, is the Dao’s teaching, awakening those who comprehend.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The world is filled with fools who see no good, recognize no law, and thus perish in great numbers. From this day forth, when someone embraces the Dao and falls gravely ill, summon these Patriarchal Masters and all Daoists to perform rites, set up altars, make offerings, and heal the afflicted. In cases of legal disputes, heaven shall dispatch celestial warriors, the Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, and the great immortals of the ten directions to assist the Daoists, swiftly curing the sick, resolving legal matters, and fulfilling the host’s every desire. Those who act thus shall be elevated through countless ranks, and my golden words shall not be in vain.\n\nShould the sick not recover, the Daoists’ efforts shall be in vain, and the host shall invite disaster, drawing misfortune upon themselves. The demon kings, their wives, children, and descendants, along with the ghost kings, shall execute without mercy all who fail to heal the afflicted.\n\nThe Dao spoke: All demon kings and those afflicted in this world—where Daoists heal them—shall turn and convert the host’s kin, their great ancestors, and all thirty-six generations of forebears, delivering them all. Let the host’s illness be cured, legal troubles dissolved, and every wish fulfilled. I shall summon the hundred ghosts to interrogate the spirits afflicting the sick. Each shall be reported, questioned by the Three Officials, and persuaded to relent. If they do not, they shall be seized and executed without mercy.\n\n\"Proclaim this with utmost urgency, as the oral command of the Most High, by law and decree.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, for all who suffer illness, dispatch the Great Halberd General to lead thirty-nine hundred million red-armored cavalry, each wielding a crimson staff, to patrol the mortal realm, lying in wait for the petty ghosts of pestilence—those who falsely claim the titles of the Three Dukes and Five Emperors—and slay them on sight. Should any petty ghost refuse to depart, the Demon Kings of the Three Heavens and their descendants shall be executed without mercy.\n\nFrom this day forward, should any among you fail to heed my incantation, your heads shall shatter into seven pieces.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, should any within the realm fall ill, it is the work of petty ghosts and minor malevolent spirits. You must swiftly withdraw your legions and disperse them, that the living may suffer no further harm—this is the command of the Demon Kings, a thousandfold and ten thousandfold. Should illness persist and the living perish, all great ghosts, both within and without, shall be slain without mercy.\n\nThe Great Demon King of the Pecked Head, the Great King Wu Yan, the Great King of the Long Nose, the Great King Zhong Xiang, the Great King of Small Eyes, the Great King of the White Face, the Great King of the Red Face, and their four hundred ninety thousand followers—each shall be interrogated, along with their descendants. Summon the petty ghosts at once and command them to cure the afflicted. If they do not, I shall have you and your petty ghosts executed without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, should any within the realm suffer illness, or face legal disputes, slander, imprisonment, or bondage under the Three Officials, unable to find relief—it is because you, the great Demon Kings, have failed in your duty. From this day on, command the petty ghosts: do not harm my people. Swiftly recall your legions and issue the writs, that the sick may recover, legal troubles dissolve, and disputes cease. With utmost urgency, as the oral command of the Most High, by law and decree.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the world, there are sixty-nine kinds of great ghostly afflictions, long-bearded and short-haired, mourning for the rivers and mountains. The rivers and mountains harbor evil ghosts, causing the people of the realm to fall ill and die. Now they come to wreak havoc upon the world, bringing sickness and stirring all manner of pestilential qi. The Yellow Slave and his seven sons conspire to kill. I have learned your names, petty ghosts—from this day forward, depart a thousand li. With utmost urgency, by law and decree.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, the thirty-six Demon Kings of the Three Heavens above and the Three Heavens shall descend and kowtow seventy times, beseeching the capture of the lesser ghosts. Since the decree of the Most High was issued, no petty ghost shall dare return to the mortal realm to take the people. Should illness persist, the Demon Kings shall suffer ten thousand executions.\n\nThe Dao spoke: My good and peaceful people dwell within the realm, yet some do not believe in the Daoist teachings. Now, if even one person receives the Dao and wears the Three Caverns, and another falls ill, when the Dharma Master performs rituals for the afflicted, you Demon Kings must assist the Daoist and ensure their recovery—then you shall ascend. Should they not recover, I shall execute your petty ghosts without mercy.\n\nAs the Most High proclaimed this merit, all the great Demon Kings descended, each bowing their heads and declaring: From this day forward, we swear never again to indulge the petty ghosts. Should even one person in the world remain stricken with illness, our heads shall shatter into forty-nine pieces.\"\n\nHere ends Scroll Eight of the *Most High Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra*.\nHere begins Scroll Nine of the *Most High Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra*.\n\n**Chapter on Slaying Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the years of *gengchen* and *renwu*, there shall come Great Thunder Ghosts, one named Nine Prosperities, leading eighty thousand lesser ghosts. Wielding crimson staves, they shall come to slay the wicked, inflicting thirty-six kinds of illness to kill evildoers. There shall also be thirty-nine million Sorrow-Simple Ghosts, spreading red swellings. Eighty-six million nine hundred thousand ghosts shall bring dysentery. Twelve million Red-Eyed Ghosts shall cause vomiting and flux. Ninety million ghosts shall afflict the eyes with pain. Forty-nine million ghosts shall bring chills and fever, sickening and killing the wicked.\n\nAt such time, where a Dharma Master recites the sutras, these ghosts shall perish of themselves. Eighty million trillion Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, together with thirty-nine thousand maidens of the Ten Directions, shall descend as one, bowing their heads to the Most High and declaring: From this day forward, if there be households troubled by illness or official misfortune, and they invite a Dharma Master to recite the sutras, should plague ghosts still linger, we swear to drive them away, banishing them ten thousand leagues, that the living may recover and official entanglements be resolved. Should they not depart, the Enforcers of the Nine Heavens shall slay them without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Many in the world do not believe in the Dao. If even one receives the scriptures, men and women mock them. A Daoist who feels no shame at the scorn of fools is no true Daoist—the Dao treasures even mockery. The great flood draws near; the year *jiashen* approaches. In *renwu* and *guiwei*, the Great Crows shall slay men. Heaven shall dispatch plague ghosts to spread *qi*, sickening and killing the wicked. Blades and weapons shall clash, and the people shall perish. Insects, snakes, tigers, wolves, water, fire, and poisonous *qi*—all shall be capable of killing men. Yet men remain ignorant, their hearts foolish, slandering the worthy, reviling Daoists, defaming scriptures, and measuring sacred texts. Such sinners shall die suddenly, choking on blood, their throats sealed, their bodies swollen, their voices lost. Heaven and its hosts shall punish them, and none shall be saved.\n\nDaoists, discipline yourselves: guard your speech and restrain your hearts.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this *renchen* year onward, the True Lord shall surely come—the True Lord is not far. Daoists who believe, take heed and study diligently, converting others to receive the scriptures, and immortals shall come to welcome you. In the *renwu* year, plague ghosts shall slaughter men, and the people shall perish utterly. The Most High, moved by compassion, shall dispatch Great Perfected Ones—Cheng Zao, Yan Ping, Wang Jinfang, She Zhou, Zhuang Xuan, Tang Jun, and others—to go among the world and convert men. Those with immortal bones from past lives shall encounter these Perfected Ones. All these Perfected Ones are men of the world, with descendants among the living, and thus the Most High sends them.\n\nThe Dao spoke: By the *renwu* year, great calamity shall come, with waters rising a thousand myriad fathoms. Daoists who enter the mountains shall escape this disaster. From the third to the ninth month of the *renwu* year, the people shall perish utterly. Thirty-seven thousand plague ghosts, heads bent on slaughter, shall come—those who do not believe shall be the first to perish. They shall inflict ninety kinds of illness to kill men. The True Lord shall soon appear, but the wicked shall not see him. Heaven shall send slaying ghosts to punish them, sweeping clean heaven and earth, remaking sun and moon, rearranging the stars, and altering the cosmic order. Divine beings shall govern the law, with immortals as their aides. For five directions and ten thousand kalpas, there shall be no death, no weapons of war. The earth shall be adorned with the seven treasures, clothing and food shall arise spontaneously, no six livestock shall remain, men and women shall all be sages, and the race of wicked men shall cease to exist.\n\nThe Dao spoke: As the great flood approaches, those who know should receive the Three Caverns. Men and women who believe in the Dharma and practice the Dao with single-minded devotion—I shall send one hundred thousand Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens to protect them. When a Daoist converts others to receive the scriptures, converting even one, the hosts of heaven shall proclaim their virtue. But if one’s heart is corrupted and they refuse conversion, the hosts of heaven shall punish them. You all have immortal destiny from past lives, and thus you encounter this sutra. This sutra is profound and wondrous, revered by the heavens above. Honor it, make offerings, and keep it in your homes—plague ghosts shall be driven away, and no evil ghosts shall dare approach.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, if there be disputes, official troubles, imprisonment, illness, peril, or the uncertainty of life and death in the world, you must swiftly recite this *Divine Incantations Sutra*. The sutra commands thirty-nine billion great spirits, who shall come to save men, and plague ghosts shall depart of themselves. The Crimson Soldiers of the Ten Directions, the Four Heavenly Demon Kings, and the maidens shall all descend to aid you, ensuring no evil befalls. Where a Daoist recites the sutras, should plague ghosts not depart, the Enforcers of the Three Heavens shall slay them without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From the *renwu* year onward, the people shall suffer many illnesses, and ghostly soldiers shall roam in bands of thousands and ten thousands, seeking to kill the wicked. When illness strikes, if a Dharma Master comes to save them, I shall also dispatch forty-nine million trillion Good Spirits and Directors of Destiny to drive away the plague ghosts, banishing them ten thousand leagues. Should they not depart, they shall be slain without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the *renwu* year, a hundred million Great Crows shall spread *qi*-borne illness, sickening and killing the wicked. The wicked do not believe—what can be done when they die? The Perfected Ones shall rise again, sweeping clean heaven and earth, and plague ghosts shall come to slaughter men. If the people wish to escape disaster, they may, in the ninth and tenth months, establish this fast, pay homage to the Five Emperors, hold a great assembly for one day and two nights, and make repentance. Bow nine times toward the east, three times toward the south, seven times toward the west, five times toward the north. Toward *qian*, *kun*, *gen*, and *xun*, bow twelve times each. Toward the upper direction, bow thirty-two times; toward the lower, twelve times. The heavenly hosts shall descend, record your merits, and inscribe your name in the Jade Register. Alternatively, face east and bow thirty-six times in single devotion—only sincerity matters, and the blessings shall be boundless.\n\nBy the *guiwei* year, plague ghosts shall spread seventy kinds of disease to slay men. Should one seek to live, let every household establish this fast, pay homage to the Five Emperors, and bow thirty times toward the south—then shall the plague ghosts flee ten thousand *li* away.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years of *jiazi*, *jiaxu*, and *jiashen*, there shall be eight hundred thousand red-tailed ghosts, named *Duo’a*, each with one head and three tails, their bodies nine *chi* in length. In their hands they hold water, bringing chills and fever to men, spreading ninety kinds of disease to afflict and kill the wicked. Daoists must swiftly convert the people, establishing a quiet abode by the water’s edge beside the Way. Hold a great assembly for one day, offering rites to the Five Emperors and the Controller of Fate, and bow thirty-six times toward the west. The heavenly hosts shall surely descend, recording the names and households of your kin in the Jade Register, sparing them from the rolls of death. Their names shall be inscribed at the Gate of Heaven, their lifespans extended by the Controller of Fate, and they shall never suffer an untimely end.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years of *jiawu* and *jiachen*, black *qi* shall bring disease to slay men. Eighty-nine myriad plague ghosts shall spread throat obstructions and dysentery to kill. Should Daoists convert the people, receiving the talismans of the Three Caverns, let them hold a great assembly upon the waters in the first, second, and third months—one day and two nights, five watches—gathering to offer rites to the Five Emperors and the Twelve Spirits. Bow twenty-five times toward the north, and the heavenly hosts shall naturally record their names.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *jiayin*, there shall be great-eyed ghosts, three *cun* in length, gathering in the thousands and myriads, accompanied by a million red crows, descending into households to slay men. Those who know this must swiftly assemble, fast, and hold rites upon the waters for one day and two nights, five watches of repentance. Bow thirty-six times toward the east, and the heavenly hosts shall surely come to record your name. The plague ghosts shall flee of their own accord, daring not draw near to men. Daoists must swiftly convert the people.\n\nThe Dao declares: The reason for disasters in the *renwu* year is that the gates of the mountains shall close—three before and two behind. Thus, in the years of *xinsi*, *renwu*, and *guiwei*, there shall surely be floods, and the regional lords, the Three Dukes, and the two-thousand-*shi* officials must swiftly turn toward goodness. In this year, plague ghosts shall certainly spread, slaying and eliminating the wicked, and those who do not believe shall perish. Daoists need only convert the foolish, and the heavenly hosts shall record their sincerity.\n\nThe Dao declares: The people of the world do not believe in the Dao and its methods, so Heaven commands plague ghosts to punish them. From this time forth, those of discernment who believe and practice shall be regarded by the heavenly hosts, who shall never allow them to suffer wrong. Wise scholars must propagate this, establishing merit and virtue—take heed!\n\nThe Dao declares: From the *renwu* year onward, thirty-six kinds of plant ghosts shall slay men. When people gather herbs from the wild to eat, the roots, stems, and leaves of these hundred plants contain ghostly toxins, named *Shengru*. *Shengru* and his brothers, a hundred myriad strong, can spread *qi*-borne diseases. On the tenth day of the month, they enter the four limbs and hundred joints of men, turning their bodies yellow and red. These ghosts are three *cun* and seven *fen* in length. In the mountains, a female ghost named *Luoweng* has one consort and two daughters, leading twenty myriad female ghosts. They lurk in the mountains, forests, and waters, lying in wait for men. There is also a female ghost named *Jiangnü*, who once had boundless merit and was destined for immortality, but for her disrespect toward the Three Heavenly Worthies and her failure to honor the Three Masters. When she sees Daoists entering the mountains, her heart harbors no goodwill. Her form is most hideous: her body stands a *zhang* tall, her face black, her eyes vertical, her entire being a sickly yellow-red, her form filthy and foul. Men do not wish to see her; those who do flee far to avoid her. For her disrespect of the Three Matters, she is taught to receive the scriptures and revere her masters, forbidden to slander the Dharma-teachers, to serve with diligence, and not to engage in frivolous conduct or associate with common folk. Those who do not follow this shall be held accountable by the heavenly hosts and condemned to dwell in the mountains for three thousand nine hundred *yi* kalpas—thus she remains trapped. Daoists who receive the secret talismans of the Three Caverns, the true essentials of the Most High, lay the foundation for their future. Yet in an instant, all may be lost. How much better to study immortality and never die through ten thousand kalpas!\n\nThe Dao declares: When Daoists receive the scriptures and find an enlightened master, possessing the fullness of the Three Caverns, they are like the wealthy of the world. Why is this? The greatly wealthy possess vast fields and estates, thousands of servants and slaves, and wealth sufficient for all needs. The poor of the world all labor for them, their desires fulfilled without want or lack. When they go forth, they ride fine steeds, their retinues at ease. When they give alms or make offerings, all is as they wish, for they are greatly wealthy. The great Dharma-teachers of the Dao, inwardly and outwardly accomplished, understand all worldly documents and letters. They are versed in healing, medicine, acupuncture, and moxibustion, and as they move among the people, the myriad folk revere and love them. The great scriptures of the Three Caverns are all complete within them, and the people honor them as they would a Heavenly King or a man of great wealth.\n\nThe Dao declares: Wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness—all are but human conditions. All receive but a single fate; what difference is there? Yet the distinctions between wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, arise from the causes of past lives. Some, having practiced the Dao in former lives, are born in the Central Kingdom with clothing and food naturally provided. Others, having established merit and virtue in past lives, now enjoy great wealth and nobility, their blessings flowing to their descendants. Some, destined for immortality in past lives but not yet ascending, now enjoy great wealth and nobility for that reason. Daoists who are poor yet delight in the Dao—this is because they have studied for long in past lives but failed to convert others, thus they are made greatly impoverished. Those who die without property or livestock have committed grave sins in past lives, failing to perform merit and virtue, disbelieving in the scriptures and the Dao. They come from among the six kinds of livestock, or from the ranks of servants and slaves. Noble Daoists all come from Heaven. Without accumulating goodness in past lives, one shall never become a noble Daoist.\n\nThe Dao declares: In this world, there are many wicked people who do not believe in the Dao. Some receive the scriptures, yet fools mock them, their laughter filling the roads. They slander the worthy, calling the Dao mad and deluded, asking, “What do they seek in the mountains?”\n\nSome claim them to be demonic spirits, feigning virtuous conduct, yet knowing nothing of all things. Man cannot long preserve himself; wealth and honor are fleeting, and cannot be held forever. The young grow old, and the old must inevitably die—three thieves within the body drag one away, yet death comes unperceived. Worldly people know only to covet wealth and cherish wives and children, preferring to commit sins rather than receive the scriptures, seek the Dao of immortality, or attend to their own burdens. Their days pass idly, yet they would do better to study the Dao, for then they would never die through ten thousand kalpas, and might wander together with the heavenly immortals.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year *renshen*, pestilential *qi* shall spread widely, bringing twenty-three kinds of disease to afflict and slay the wicked. Only those who have received the scriptures, revered the Three Masters, and healed all manner of illnesses shall be noted by the heavenly beings. When the land embraces the Dao and receives the Three Caverns, teaching and transforming the people, then the emperors and kings of the Middle Kingdom shall remain unaware of the myriad evils summoned by the common folk—evils that arise from below without cause or origin, as a hundred ghosts vie to descend. At that time, male and female Daoists must unite in their efforts to remedy this. I shall dispatch thirty-nine hundred million Great Expelling Generals from the ten directions to aid the Daoists in driving them away.\n\nThe Dao declares: Within the Three Realms, fools who do not believe in the Dao and its methods die and enter the ranks of evil ghosts. Thus, these men and women, with their countless ghostly soldiers, come to slay the wicked. From this time forward, when one, two, or three households fall ill with affliction and distress, invite a great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns to recite the scriptures for one day and two nights, performing the five watches, practicing the Way of Nine Ones and the *qi* of Three Fives, and invoking the positions of the ten directions. In every direction, ghosts shall be slain, and even the ghost kings shall not dare to resist. Now, I myself shall send four hundred thousand Red Bow Soldiers and thirty-nine thousand Strongmen of the Nine Provinces to assist the Daoists, driving away all great ghosts, mountain and forest demons, *qi* of the ten directions, and ghostly bandits—all shall be cut down.\n\nThe Great Demon King and lesser kings, following my teachings, shall command the lesser ghosts to aid the Daoists in curing the host’s illness and resolving urgent official matters. Should they fail to comply with the law, the Demon Kings *Weirui* and others shall be slain without mercy. The Dao declares: All Daoists come from Heaven. Though worldly people may be base, ugly, or lowly, if their hearts believe in the Three Caverns, they too come from Heaven. The good are not necessarily fair of form; each has their own karmic causes. Those of upright appearance come from thoughts of goodness. The greatly wealthy come from past lives of almsgiving to the poor. The greatly noble come from building merit and worshiping the Three Treasures. Daoist Dharma Masters come from accumulated study. Thus, those who yearn for the Great Vehicle do so on the foundation of past lives—it is not suddenly attained in this one. If a Daoist aspires to the mountains and marshes, renouncing official life and severing all ties to enter the mountains and cultivate the Dao, such a one is not far from immortality. When such Daoists wander the world, healing the sick, the Demon Kings shall aid them.\n\nThe Dao declares: The world is full of those who drift heedlessly, unaware of the day of their death—these are but walking corpses. Daoists who seek immortality, receiving the essentials of the Three Caverns, should exhort others to do the same. Whether dwelling in the mountains or among people, they transform all fools. Yet fools, bound by desire, refuse to accept the Dao. When floods come, they shall perish; when blades strike, they shall be slain, flowing with the mud, and only then will they regret in vain. When the great expulsion and annihilation occurs, ghostly soldiers shall rage unchecked, causing evil ghosts to slay people throughout the land. But where Daoists practice the scriptures and save others through their recitations, all the great and lesser Demon Kings, male and female heavenly beings, shall come together with the Daoists to heal the sick, resolve official matters, and grant all wishes as the heart desires. Should any defiant ghostly *qi* arise to harm the living, the Demon Kings *Yunzhou* and others shall shatter their heads into sixteen pieces—none shall be spared.\n\nAll is as decreed by the Most High. The Dao declares: From this time forward, evil ghosts shall slay people, including the ghost named Red Eyebrow *Wuran* and his forty-eight thousand followers, who shall rampage across the land to slay the wicked. When Daoists and female Daoist priests come to save a host, the lesser ghost kings shall swiftly report to the Great Demon King, who shall command the Strongmen to aid the Daoists in transforming people, dispelling illness and *qi*, and resolving all matters. On the day of no other recourse, we shall ascend a thousandfold, ten thousandfold, never betraying the Golden Mouth. Those who do not believe shall be hewn into ten thousand pieces by the Demon Kings and lesser ghost kings—none shall be spared.\n\nHere ends Scroll Nine of *The Most High Scripture of the Wondrous Spells of the Cavern Abyss*.\nHere begins Scroll Ten of *The Most High Scripture of the Wondrous Spells of the Cavern Abyss*.\n\n**Chapter on Slaying Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao spoke: On Mount Xuandu, I expounded the *Great Scripture of Expulsion* to all demon kings. At that time, the Three Heavenly Princes sought the *Scriptures of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials*. Ten Perfected Ones from the ten lands also requested the *Scripture of Samādhi, the Boundless Primal Essence*. Furthermore, immortals from the ten directions sought the *Scriptures of the Yellow Court’s Inner and Outer Two Sceneries of Daoic Transformation*. From the four quarters of Jambudvīpa, thirty thousand Perfected Ones gathered to hear the scripture.\n\nBefore the exposition was complete, they all descended from their seats and said: \"The people of the world do not comprehend the Dao and its methods. Epidemic ghosts slay them, blades and violence oppress them, and the people suffer bitterly. Death fills every household, and none possess the Three Caverns to deliver themselves. We beseech this Dharma Master to disseminate these teachings throughout the world. May the Heavenly Worthy incline toward the transformation of the Dao.\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"Excellent, excellent! Now I shall dispatch thirty thousand Perfected Ones to carry the scriptures and propagate the Dao across the world.\" There was also the Perfected One Nihe, who led thirty-nine thousand followers, bearing the scriptures to spread the teachings throughout the land. The people of the Middle Kingdom all received them. For households afflicted by sudden illness or official troubles, they would transmit the scriptures. Practicing the Dao thrice a day and night, official matters would be resolved, and the sick would recover. Epidemic ghosts lingering without departure would be slain one by one—none would be spared.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"These Perfected Ones share profound karmic ties with the people of this land, and thus they are sent to transmit the scriptures. Those who receive the Three Cavern scriptures all possess prior blessings and karmic conditions, destined for transcendence, and only then do they encounter such teachers. From this day forward, if there are those who uphold and wear these scriptures, I and the heavenly beings shall protect them, and no evil shall befall them.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the *renwu* year, great calamities shall arise. The people will be restless, the six barbarian tribes unsettled, and epidemic ghosts will slay them. One may craft spirit talismans and, according to the method, place them within homes for peace. Three, five, ten, or a hundred households may gather by the water. On a single day, hold a grand assembly, constructing an earthen altar eight feet wide and six feet high. Facing east, perform thirty-six prostrations, paying homage to the Five Emperors. Submit a memorial to the heavenly beings, and they shall surely record your sincere devotion.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the sixth month of the *xinsi* year, the ninth month of the *renwu* year, and the seventh month of the *guiwei* year, eighty thousand epidemic ghosts shall descend to slay the people. The ghost named Wutu Lunna stands seventy *zhang* tall, and they gather in the thousands and tens of thousands. There shall also be great crimson crows, their forms like cartwheels, flying to devour people. If one upholds the Three Cavern scriptures and practices them among the people, these plague crows shall perish. Let the Daoists bear witness to this truth.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The great kalpa draws near, and rulers grow greedy and cruel. They neglect the common folk, who fall into destitution. Corvée labor is unjust, and the people suffer hardship. Wails fill the roads, and corpses cover the fields. Men and women lose their proper seasons, forsaking the Dao and its methods, fleeing in panic. The six barbarian tribes stir in chaos, and great bandits run rampant. They contend with *qi*, fathers and sons grow suspicious of one another. Heaven sends epidemic ghosts to execute these sinners. Their crimes are grave, and they shall face the great flood. The waters shall come soon, yet they remain unaware. Daoist masters and priests, in households where transformation is underway, the Three Heavenly Kings, all immortals, and jade maidens from the ten directions shall come to assist. They shall strengthen the Daoists, and the households they save shall be protected by heavenly beings. Illness and official troubles shall swiftly be resolved, ghostly *qi* shall dissipate, and the sick shall recover. If even a single ghost lingers, it shall be slain—no mercy shall be granted.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The Lords of the Ten Directions declare: 'In this degenerate age, people are mostly wicked, and few believe in the Dao. The world remains untransformed. In the *renwu* year, eighty million epidemic ghosts shall be dispatched, spreading seventy kinds of diseases to slay the people. Those who are aware should establish this fast in every household, bowing to the Five Emperors by the great waters. Face the northwest in prostration, and craft a great talisman to hang above the main gate. Epidemic ghosts shall not dare approach. For households without talismans or those that do not hang this charm, the epidemic ghosts shall harm them. This talisman is guarded by eighty million mighty warriors.'\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"By the *jiaxu* and *renwu* years, there shall be eight thousand nine hundred red-faced ghosts named Mingzhen. Each shall lead thirty-nine thousand lesser ghosts, all wielding crimson staves to bludgeon the wicked. The wicked are many, for they do not believe in the flood or the Dao and its methods, and thus they shall fall into the Three Wretched Realms and Five Tribulations. The Most High, in profound vision, pities all beings and thus delivers them.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the *renwu* year, for all who hold fasts and transmit the *Scripture of Boundless Samādhi*, epidemic ghosts shall not dare approach. Daoists who have received the Three Cavern teachings and propagate them shall be aided by the Heavenly Emperor and shall never fall into evil destinies.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"From the *guiwei* to the *jiashen* years, three hundred ninety thousand *qi*-crows shall fly over the central rivers, spreading poison into households and afflicting people with water-borne illnesses, which cannot be cured. If one wears talismans and scriptures, and five or ten households build a healing abode by the water, making offerings to the Three Treasures with morning and evening incense and lamps, performing repentance and prostrations, and paying homage to the Five Emperors for one, two, or seven days, the heavenly beings shall surely record your name, and it shall enter the Jade Register.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The great calamity draws near, and the flood shall come soon. Foolish people remain oblivious, idly passing their days. One hundred twenty thousand celestial maidens shall descend to transform them, yet the people shall not perceive it. If in the *xinsi* year one encounters these maidens’ transformation, you shall attain transcendence.\"\n\nIf one suffers from illness, legal troubles, or slander, let the Dharma masters and Daoist priests perform rituals to transform their fate. The celestial maidens shall also come to assist you, ensuring the household avoids misfortune.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"By the *guiwei* year, the Dao’s qi shall flourish daily, and the Three Caverns shall spread across the four seas and nine provinces, where all shall believe and rejoice. If Daoist hearts remain upright, the ruler shall uphold the Way. Sweep and purify every palace hall, erecting scripture altars within. Light lamps morning and evening, burn incense, and perform prostrations. Plague demons shall flee, the sick shall recover, and legal troubles shall dissolve. The armies of the Three Heavens shall shield the Dharma masters; wherever they walk, ghosts and bandits shall be driven a thousand miles away, and heavenly beings shall descend to aid the Daoists.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the *jiashen* year, great dragons shall ascend to heaven in flocks of ninety thousand. Whoever witnesses this shall know the great flood draws near. Daoists who enter the mountains may preserve their lives. Yet worldly people, steeped in wickedness, indulge in lust, covet wealth, and kill without restraint. Their cruel hearts never change; they scorn the Great Dao, refuse to cultivate immortal practices, and when they see others receive the scriptures, they mock them instead. Such people shall enter the endless hells, where each day they endure seven deaths and seven rebirths before being revived again. This torment shall last forty-two kalpas before they are released. Even then, as humans, they shall be maimed—deaf, mute, or dumb, afflicted with goiters, missing limbs, blind, cleft-lipped, hunchbacked, or crippled, their faces like deer, their feet like roebucks, without hands or feet. No one shall wish to see them; those who do shall retch in disgust. Such is the retribution for their past deeds.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"Where the virtuous are born, they surpass others in wisdom, for this comes from past lives of study. Those born with deformities bear the weight of grave sins from former existences. If such a person remains untransformed, it is because they have never witnessed goodness. Daoists must still strive to convert them, for the heavenly beings shall record your resolve. To fail in this is to betray the sincere devotion of those who came before, and it is not the way of the Great Beings who deliver all beings.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"By the *renwu* year, thirty thousand white-headed ghosts shall appear, each named *Thousand Transformations*, their bodies thirty feet tall, their faces emanating qi, their heads white, gathering in the millions. They shall unleash thirty-nine thousand kinds of diseases to slay the wicked. Those who scorn the Dao and its teachings, slander Daoist priests, or criticize the scriptures—who argue over right and wrong, claim the scriptures lack power, and fail to grasp the Dao’s profound depth, as boundless as the heavens and as immeasurable as the sea—shall face their judgment.\"\n\nThus do the foolish-hearted expound the wondrous scriptures. They scorn Daoist priests, claiming the world holds no numinous power. Their minds waver between two paths, corrupting the true heart. Such sinners deserve ten thousand deaths, to be cast upside-down into the hells. There they shall stand inverted for thirty kalpas, and only when the kalpa ends shall they emerge—reborn as the six kinds of livestock.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The people of the world are mostly foolish, and so Heaven commands the myriad spirits to slay them with baleful qi. The reason for their slaughter is their slander of Daoist priests and the murder of good people. Now, those who disbelieve in the Great Dao, disrespect the Three Treasures, and refuse to receive the scriptures—Heaven’s soldiers shall execute them. Today, three thousand and sixty kinds of diseases slay people; there are thirty thousand flesh-ghosts, one hundred thousand stone-ghosts, twenty thousand wood-ghosts, thirty-six million water-ghosts, six hundred thousand earth-ghosts, and one hundred sixty-six thousand insect-ghosts, all capable of killing. The reason they can kill is that the ghosts attach themselves to these things to slay people: entering water, one drowns; entering mountains, one is crushed by stones; felling trees, one is killed by wood; eating meat, one dies by its qi; digging earth, one is buried by soil; entering grass, one is harmed by insects—all these are the qi of unlawful forces.\n\nFrom this day forward, Daoist priests must diligently convert the myriad families, teaching foolish men and women to all devote themselves to the Dao, so that ghosts will not draw near. If they refuse to believe, on the day of the great expulsion, I fear the ghostly soldiers will come to execute you.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the *renwu* year, the lord of the Six Barbarians shall all submit to the Great Dao, and the Three Caverns’ teachings shall spread far and wide. Those who enter the mountains shall be found everywhere. You who receive the dharma and uphold the scriptures—whether great or small, old or young, man or woman—only those with the heart to devote themselves shall have their lifespans extended by the heavenly beings, never meeting an untimely death, and naturally attaining the ranks of immortality.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"From this day forward, if there are Daoist priests, male or female officials, who diligently convert the myriad people, traveling through the lands to heal the hundred diseases, then you, demon kings, heavenly beings, and lesser ghost kings, must all assist the Daoist priests in treating illnesses, preventing the living from suffering misfortune, cutting short their lifespans, slaying ghosts, and pacifying people.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"From this day forward, I command all ghost kings to follow Daoist priests and pacify people, curing the myriad diseases so that none remain unhealed. If any disease is not cured, they shall be hacked into ten thousand pieces. Now I dispatch the divine generals of the five directions and the great soldiers of the nine heavens—thirty-nine million in all—to descend as one. They shall assist the households where Daoist priests treat illnesses, resolving all afflictions and official matters at once. Those who disobey shall be seized first by the ghost kings. All shall follow the oral decree of the Most High, without delay or violation of the statutes. Hasten, as the law commands!\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The people of the world do not believe in the Dao, nor do they receive the scriptures. Born into worldly customs, they bring upon themselves the root of sin. Seeing others do good, they mock those who practice the Dao; they disrespect the Three Treasures, and the heavenly beings shall execute them. Suddenly they depart, and though they may regret it, what use is remorse? Now I dispatch thirty million vajra-warriors from the ten directions to descend as one and assist these Daoist priests wherever they go, pacifying people and severing evil. If any insult, curse, strike, scheme against, or steal from Daoist priests, their souls shall be seized one by one and handed over to the local hells for punishment, so they may know their guilt and understand Heaven’s decree. Ghost kings, take these words of mine and execute such evil people for these Daoist priests. If you do not slay them, the heavenly beings will be displeased, and the Great Dao will lose its numinous power.\"\n\nAll demon kings replied: \"So be it! We shall each follow the command and now slay such people.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"From this day forward, wherever Daoist priests travel to convert others at the borders of foreign lands, seeking out the sick, they must perform rites and recite scriptures for each one. I shall dispatch eight hundred thousand great soldiers from the ten directions to assist you in your work. I command all great demon kings to ensure that no evil winds blow across the land, that rain does not fall in torrents, that people and ghosts live in harmony, that the common folk rejoice, and that kings believe in the Dao. If the common people receive the scriptures for seven days, they may enter the mountains and ascend as immortals. If this is not so, I shall no longer be called the Great Dao, nor shall I convert people again.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"When great dharma masters treat illnesses, they need only recite the oral talismans, not write them on paper, and cure them in silence. When reciting scriptures and performing the Dao, none shall remain uncured. If a patient is gravely ill, the oral talismans may also be recited aloud to repent past transgressions, untangle karmic nets, and absolve sins and retributions. Daoist masters of the Three Caverns need only enter a quiet chamber to commune with like-minded souls. When Daoist priests practice the qi of the Nine Ones or the qi of the Three Fives, all heavenly vajra-warriors and divine kings shall descend without fail. This is the art of the celestial perfected, the heavenly beings, and the divine maidens; all heavenly beings shall descend to assist your heart, and official matters and illnesses shall be cured without exception.\n\nFrom this day forward, in the households where Daoist priests perform the Dao, great demon kings and lesser ghost kings shall all follow and assist, ensuring the sick are cured. If they are not cured, the lesser kings and the great demon kings, along with Wei Zhen, shall have their heads shattered into eighty pieces. All shall follow the oral decree of the Most High, and none shall be spared.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"Daoist priests who uphold the Three Caverns must not travel together with those who practice the Yellow and Red Ways. Daoist priests who uphold the scriptures and masters of the Three Caverns should enter the mountains to distance themselves from the impure world. If they remain among people, male and female Daoist priests of the Yellow and Red Ways must establish separate lodgings. If they wish to meet, they must choose auspicious days: *gengshen*, *jiazi*, *dingmao*, *jimao*, the 8th, 12th, 22nd, 9th, 1st, and 18th days—these are the proper days.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"All demon kings, from this day forward, wherever Daoist priests go to save people, ensure that the suffering of the living is cured and their official matters resolved.\"\n\n\"Should any person commit evil deeds, suppress them all—then a hundred blessings shall gather upon their body, bringing peace to people and slaying demons. If illness is cured, they shall ascend into the Great Dao. Should any fail to aid Daoist priests and cause the death of the living, you shall each rend them into ten thousand pieces, showing no mercy. Execute every command as if spoken by the Most High’s own lips—swiftly, as the law decrees.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Now there are eighty thousand black-bodied ghosts, each six inches tall, riding upon crows in flight to dwell in the waters. When wind and rain arise, they cling to human bodies, and those afflicted shall die. There are also thirty-nine thousand sand-dwelling Hu ghosts, each three inches tall, their forms red and white. When waters surge, they attach themselves to people. Further, there are eight hundred thousand great damp ghosts, named Heaven’s Head, whose masters delight in violence and chaos. Each commands thirty thousand ghostly brigands to enter human dwellings, causing fires that cannot be extinguished. Such ghosts, in the era of great floods, will incite rulers to cruel governance, leading to the slaughter of the people. Yet those Daoist priests who receive the scriptures and devote themselves to the mountains, refusing worldly office—such persons, along with the male and female practitioners of the Yellow and Red Ways—shall not be harmed.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forth, there shall be a great ghost named Collapsing Zhou. Ten thousand great ghosts, named Li Zi, Shi Er, and Peach Ginger, shall in the *renwu* year each lead one hundred twenty thousand to slay the wicked—only true persons and Daoist priests shall they dare not offend. From this moment until the *jiaxu* year and beyond, ten million ghostly soldiers shall come to kill the evil. Should any foolish ones have Daoist priests recite scriptures and perform rites to save them, heaven’s people shall aid them, and the ghost kings shall take pity, coming to protect them.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day until the *renwu* year through the *renchen* year and the *zi* and *chou* years, great ghosts shall slay people. Of those who survive, barely three or four in ten shall remain—so numerous are the wicked. Thus heaven punishes them with blades, weapons, and drowning. Alas, alas! Only those who receive the scriptures as Daoist priests shall be welcomed by heaven’s people. As the great kalpa nears its end, they shall swiftly come. Ghosts shall rise in competition, and people shall die of pestilence. Should any have a master of the Three Caverns perform the Dao for them, all great ghost kings and demon kings shall protect and assist, curing their illnesses at once. They shall subdue the wayward ghosts of the world, both inner and outer, driving them a thousand feet into the earth. If the afflicted do not recover, death shall spread like carrion, official matters unresolved, fields and silkworms barren, careers stagnant, and all shall be as they wish it not. The officials and soldiers shall be the first to answer, and the great demon kings and lesser ghostlings shall rend them into a thousand pieces, showing no mercy. Proclaim every decree as if uttered by the Most High’s golden lips—swiftly, as the law decrees.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Now there are eighty-nine thousand black-faced great ghosts, named Red Beard, each seven *zhang* tall. In groups of four hundred ninety thousand, they falsely claim to be the Yellow Emperor, terrorizing the households of the living. Leading all manner of unregistered ghosts, the *wangliang* of the world, and the male and female *□*, they command Luo Ding Le Zhang, Nan Yang Ye Gong, Stone Mother’s Prince, Yun Zhong Li Zi Ao, and the ghosts of the Three Heavens Without Attachment—countless in number, they invade homes to seize infants, the elderly, men, and women, causing illness and death throughout the land, present in every place, death at every door. Ghostly soldiers shall gather, occupying the lanes and paths of the people, seizing their livestock and beasts, while birds and animals manifest omens of misfortune. People shall suffer official disputes, unjust imprisonment, and wrongful punishment; their fields and silkworms shall fail, and every endeavor shall bring misfortune. From this day forth, you demon kings, lesser ghosts, and all ghost kings must swiftly assist Daoist priests in aiding the living—resolving their official matters and curing their illnesses. Should you disobey, each of you demon kings shall be rent into ten thousand pieces. Execute every command as the Most High’s oral decree and the law demand.\"\n\n**The Tenth Scroll of the *Supreme Scripture of the Wondrous Abyss and Divine Spells* concludes.**\n**The Eleventh Scroll of the *Supreme Scripture of the Wondrous Abyss and Divine Spells* begins.**\n**Chapter on the Samādhi King’s Summons of Ghosts and Spirits**\n\nIn the second year of the Highest August’s reign, during the *chen* month of the establishment of spring, at noon on the eighth day, within the Supreme Yang’s Upper Palace, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the *Scripture of the Wondrous Cavern, Numinous Treasure, Great Possession, Utmost Perfection, and Natural Wisdom of Pure Sincerity* to the Great Brahmā Heavenly Emperor of the Great Luo, the Lofty Perfected of the Four Poles, the Primordial Kings of the Nine Heavens, and the True August Ones of the Three Heavens. When the Dharma rites were complete, he further summoned the Heavenly Lords of the Three Qi, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Perfected Immortals of the Nine Palaces, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors of the Four Boundless Directions, the Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Nine Lands, and the officials of the Three Realms. Surrounded by the Great Demons of the Divine Empyrean, they soared through the vast sky, returning their chariots to descend upon the Azure Sea’s shore in the Wànlì Heaven, within the Jade Pool’s Chamber of the Wondrous Abyss. Seated upon a five-colored flying dragon lotus throne, he was about to expound the essential Dharma to save and deliver all sentient beings of the Three Realms and Five Paths. Radiating his majestic light, he illuminated the dragon palaces of the one hundred eighty seas in the ten directions, the courts of the Fengdu and Yánggǔ Water Assemblies, the palaces of the Earthly Sovereigns of the Nine Lands and Thirty-Six Earths in the Windy Marsh, the registries of the Perfected Immortals and Great Sages, and the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens—each possessing its own sun, moon, and stars, its officials, people, livestock, birds, beasts, insects, and fish, all deeming themselves secure and joyful. Those without divine Dao, the common folk—husbands and wives, men and women, old and young, high and low—all trace their lineages, bearing manifold names and forms. The Five Agents, yin and yang, fortune and misfortune, suffering and joy, poverty and wealth, nobility and baseness—all are as in this world, with no difference. There are also those who study the Dao and seek immortality, dwelling in mountains and valleys to realize the Dao and attain sagehood. Yet without cultivating the Six Penetrations and Six Awakenings, they cannot be called Daoist priests, but are termed other scholars, for they lack such matters—even unto the boundless worlds of the uppermost heavens.\n\nAll realms where sages and beings dwell, the karmic retribution of suffering and joy—pray, let the nine murky springs of the netherworld and the grotto-heavens of the Five Marchmounts be revealed, that all in the great assembly may witness the retribution of good and evil, life and death: the ceaseless toil through cycles of filth and flame, drifting through the Eight Gates, self-born and self-perishing, a sight most piteous and grievous.\n\nWithin the great assembly, among the ranks of heavenly beings and earthbound immortals, some possess minor knowledge and insight, soaring through the Five Marchmounts, practicing corpse-liberation, ingesting elixirs, and refining the body. Yet those who do not aspire to the vast wisdom-source of the Numinous Treasure, who have not attained the true quiescence and spontaneous nature of past lives, find their minds unsteady, deluded by falsehoods, swayed by the Six Passions. At times, clinging to their attachments, their four views drift and scatter, above in the heavens or below on earth, where, according to the weight of their evil, they receive their retribution. With no self-exhortation, they endure manifold torments, all filled with dread. Their five spirits mourn in dismay, yet they know not where to turn, each desiring to flee but unable to depart. Gazing at one another, they say: \"Today we have encountered the Sacred Venerable—why must we witness such dire retribution?\" Their bodies and minds tremble in terror, unable to find peace. They can only pray to the Heavenly Venerable, beseeching mercy and deliverance, to expound the primordial origin and restore their original minds.\n\nThereupon, from among the assembly, the Flying Heavenly King of the Nine Heavens, named Samādhi Majestic Virtue, arose from his seat. Radiant with wisdom and adorned with auspicious marks, he possessed the power to subdue all demons. Heavenly spirits, dragons, and ghosts all revered his luminous incantations and skillful expedient means, which brought timely benefit. Leading the perfected ones, the Radiant Net King, and the thirty-six lesser kings of the heavens, including King Gulou, they adjusted their robes and crowns, rose together, and prostrated themselves, knocking their heads to the ground in reverence. Kneeling, they bowed deeply and addressed the Dao Lord:\n\n\"We, having accumulated profound merit, have been graced by the presence of the Great Sage, following the perfected immortals and the lofty and mysterious adepts. Overwhelmed by undeserved favor, we hold our royal positions, each governing the various heavens, our joy and awe intermingled. Today, beholding your compassionate radiance, you have further opened the great amnesty. We have all come, having once received your teachings and decrees, traversing the Three Realms, the thirty-two heavens, and the lands of the ten directions—mountains, forests, sacred peaks, and the dragon palaces beneath the seas, as well as the grotto-heavens and blessed lands. At times we roam the world, at others we enter the human realm, adapting to the customs of the multitudes, sharing in their labors, experiencing the ranks of noble and base, rich and poor. Some dwell in secluded mountains, engaging in cultivation, while others endure the hardships of livestock, insects, water, and fire—there is nowhere we do not enter.\n\nWe have witnessed the common folk, whether learned or unlearned, heedless of past lives, disregarding scriptural teachings. Their judgments are confused, their four views deluded, their Six Passions stained, their minds uncentered. When committing evil, they feel no fear; at times, seized by terror, they cry out to gods and ghosts, seeking deliverance. Some invoke the Three Luminaries, their seven ancestors, or the departed as oaths, racing against one another without end. Families turn against one another, killing without principle. In times of war and famine, relying on brute force, they gather mobs to slaughter the innocent. All beings—humans, ghosts, birds, and beasts—when facing the end of life, cling to their homes, cherish their bodies, their hearts gripped by urgency and longing. Some harbor evil thoughts, others utter wicked vows. Following their original oaths, wherever they reside, wherever blood and flesh adhere, wherever qi is exhaled or eyes gaze, they generate evil karmic causes. Their ethereal souls become habituated, their retribution endless. Having not entered the natural precepts of the Numinous Treasure’s wisdom, how can they escape?\n\nSome believe their refined spirits and subtle mind-and-form are stirred by light, sound, and qi, thus riding the qi of the Six Heavens, the Five Yous, the hundred spirits, the Nine Uglies, the Eight Winds, and the waxing and waning of the Five Agents. They attract calamities: pestilence, plagues, and a hundred diseases arise. Creditors and enemies, slander and defamation—many suffer such encounters. In cities and government dwellings, villages and mountain marshes, wails follow one another, malevolent spirits grow fiercer, and human hearts tremble with fear, giving rise to chills and fevers. From within, cold and heat arise; from without, illness is born. Some pray to shrines and temples, invoking the impure qi of old ghosts who seek blood offerings, falsely predicting fortune and misfortune. Unaware of the true Dao, ignorant of their return, blind to scriptural teachings, they fail to recognize their original nature. Entangled with the hundred spirits, they accumulate sins before the Three Officials, sinking into the Five Paths, self-born and self-perishing, forever without escape.\n\nAt times, the Five Dipper star-officials announce calamities and disasters: floods, droughts, winds, and rains that disrupt the four seasons; blades, wars, and epidemics that bring inauspicious qi. Rulers grow anxious, the people suffer in filth and flame, with no deliverance. Today, by the power of the Sacred Venerable, we have been entrusted as divine kings. Having witnessed all this, we pray for peace and nurturance, to repay your compassion. We shall lead our hosts—the thirty-six lesser kings of the heavens and eighty million beings—to traverse the ten directions, healing the sick, protecting nations, nurturing all life, and spreading the true Dharma. Is this not our shared duty?\"\n\nThereupon, the perfected Radiant Net King led forty-nine billion perfected immortals and their retinues. With them were the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings; the thirty-six Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens, numbering thirty-six billion; the divine kings of great spiritual penetrations and wisdom, the Sentence-People and Divine Youths, totaling eight billion; the Heavenly Prohibition Great Executioners and their soldiers, four hundred thousand; the Heavenly Execution Great Soldiers, four hundred thousand; the Upper Three Heavenly Marshals of the Dark Blade, thirty thousand; the Great Soldiers of the Nine Heavens, ninety billion; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Demon Kings, including King Gupenzi, and seventy-two lesser kings; the Demon King Wulinzi and the Great Demon King Wuliuzi, totaling thirty-six million; the Three Heavenly Jade Maidens and the Great Brahma Maidens, eighty million; the Seven Heavenly Demon Kings, three hundred thousand; the Generals of Rampant Slaughter, eighty million; the Great Demon Kings of Azure Perfection—Zizhen, Konglun, Wuyanshuai, and Chongquan—and thirty-nine kings, including Wuchuan, Lianzi, Wenjixiu, and Fenglianzi, totaling three billion six hundred million; the Three Heavenly Valiant Soldiers, three hundred thousand; and the Great Execution Generals of the Ten Directions, three hundred thousand, who govern the plague demons, dispel disasters and mists, and sweep away defilements.\n\nMoreover, there are the Thirty-Six Heavenly Demon Kings, including Jupoqiang, numbering one hundred twenty thousand; the forty-two Demon Kings of the Radiant Heavenly Capital, such as Wumingjiu, who slay ghosts and cure diseases; the Valiant Soldiers of the Three Heavens and the Crimson Armies of the Ten Directions; and the Three Heavenly Jade Maidens and the Generals of Urgent Advance, fifty million in total, who ever dwell upon the Five Peaks to gather all plague demons.\n\nThere are also the Demon Kings of Beaked Heads, the Great King Wuyan, the Great King of Long Noses, the Great King of the Central [Realm], the Great King of Small Eyes, the Great King of White Faces, and the Great King of Red Faces, each wielding their divine transformations, sovereign might, and boundless power. Before the Most High, they prostrate themselves with utmost reverence, jointly vowing with the King of Samādhi Divine Mantras to traverse the Three Realms, the earth above and below, and the sacred mountains, rivers, and grotto-heavens. They pledge to eradicate the Six Heavenly and Nine Ugly [Demons], the perverse *qi* of the Five Pestilences and rebellious forces, the harms inflicted upon the people, and all monstrous anomalies, as well as the outbreaks of warfare. \"We possess the power to crush and annihilate them, to transform their hearts, and to sever all demonic *qi*. We only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to show mercy upon us and all our retinues, elevating us to the ranks of the Dao, that we may never regress.\"\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One Weiming declared to the King of Samādhi Divine Mantras: \"We, who now gather and extinguish perverse *qi*, capture ghosts, and cure diseases, must reveal the names of the plague-spreading demons, so that people may recite and invoke them. When these plague-spreading demons hear their own names, they will feel momentary shame and fear. Amidst the assembly before the Three Treasures, they will be humiliated by their own evil and dare not cause harm. Now, by the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion and majestic command, the luminous might of the Three Heavens and Five *Qi*, and the rectifying deities who scrutinize the myriad spirits, we shall disclose their names. I shall instruct the Direct Supervisors and Recorders to itemize and inscribe them, making them known to all devout men and women under heaven.\"\n\nThereupon, the King of Samādhi Divine Mantras universally proclaimed to the Three Realms, the Five Paths, the Six Deng, the Nine Dark Springs, and the curved abodes of all ghostly kings, the Dragon Kings of Water and Earth, the Avian Kings, and all spirits—whether those who neither ascend to heaven nor dwell upon the earth, who roam the world, ride the Eight Winds, mount the *qi* of the Nine Uglies, rely on trees as dwellings, or absorb human essence and pursue blood offerings to incite disasters—commanding them all to reveal their names and dare not conceal themselves.\n\nThereupon, the Ancient Spirits of the Five Directions and the Five Harmful Ghostly Thieves conferred among themselves: \"We are of lowly status in the mortal world, our virtue and power meager, our strength insufficient. We know not where to flee. If we do not submit our names, we shall be reduced to ashes, our retinues plunged into suffering. Beset by calamities before and behind, we can only beg for great compassion, that you grant us leniency. We wish to exhort one another to abandon the mundane, return to the Dao, submit to your teachings, and never again cause harm.\"\n\nThereupon, the Three Heavenly Wicked Kings led four hundred eighty thousand, while the Six Heavenly Wicked Kings and the Three Heavenly Great Wicked Kings numbered nine hundred million.\n\nMoreover, there are eighty thousand one-footed ghosts, each three feet tall, forming bands that dwell in waters to spread *qi*-induced illnesses. There are also Shenyou Aizi, Jiao’er Pingwang, Axin Sanye, and thirty thousand Red Ghosts who spread the plague of warfare.

There are three hundred thousand Long-Headed Ghosts, each wielding a crimson staff to violently beat and kill people. There are the ghosts of those who died by the sword in battle, such as Li Ziao of the Cloudy Realm, who wander the seashores of the four directions, riding winds and mounting sparrows to create anomalies and spread plagues.\n\nThere are the ghosts of Gaoyao’s wooden fetters, who practice punishments and executions, turning all implements of harm into ghostly spirits. There are the Lianzi Ghosts who spread malaria and sores. There is the Ghost King named Youlian, three *zhang* and seven *chi* tall, wielding a crimson rope to incite quarrels and agitate human hearts.

There are twenty thousand Red-Rope Ghost Kings named Baishou, leading thirty-nine thousand female ghosts to spread diseases. There are the Crimson Capital Ghosts who spread seventy-eight kinds of illness, sometimes transforming into crows and magpies to circle human dwellings, exhaling *qi* to spread disease.\n\nAgain there are the Crimson-Cliff Ghosts, eighty *zhang* tall, sometimes transforming into flying crows to spread disease, or into dead fish, crows, beasts, or wild fruits—whoever consumes them contracts poisonous illnesses. There is the Yellow-Ox Ghost King named Red-Stone, leading red-headed crows to spread toxic diseases. There are Li Ziao’s brothers, numbering a thousand billion ghosts, who band together to kill humans. There are the three Jūliúnà Ghosts, each leading eight million ghosts to spread various toxic illnesses. There are the ghosts of Deng Hou and Liu Douwu, who also come to spread disease and harm the people. There are the Three-Legged Ghosts, three *zhang* tall, with human bodies that move sideways. There are the three hundred sixty Quyin Ghosts, the Cross-Eyed Ghosts, the Fillet-Headed Ghosts, and the Dangjin Ghosts, all spreading pestilential diseases.

There are one hundred twenty kinds of hunting ghosts in the clouds, seventy-two kings, the Hook-Star Ghosts, the Wu-Huo Ghosts, the Night-Walking Ghosts, and the Flying-Running Ghosts, who roam the world spreading madness and deviance. There are the Nine-Ugly Ghosts, the Di-Star Mad-Clouds, the myriad demonic gallopers, the bell-horses and shadow-shouters, nine brothers in all. There are Liu Yuanda, Zhang Yuanbo, Zhao Gongming, Li Gongzhong, Shi Wenye, Zhong Shiji, and Shaodu Fu, each leading two hundred fifty thousand plague-spirit ghosts to spread pestilential diseases.\n\nThese ghost kings, upon hearing the names of the Three-Modes Divine Mantra Heavenly Kings, the Radiant-Net Realized Ones, the Many-Heard Heavenly Women, and the Great Demonic Kings of the Three Heavens and Six Heavens—all emanations of malevolent *qi*, thieving spirits, and harming essences—were greatly alarmed and terrified.\n\nFurther, the Hunting Hook-Star Nine-*Qi* Ghosts cried out in unison: “We and our kin have, since ancient times, relied upon our bodies, speech, and lives for sustenance, feeding only on human essence-*qi* and the blood and flesh of the six livestock, using them to sustain ourselves and driving ghostly souls as our servants. If we now uphold the precepts and cannot roam freely, seeking to preserve others while facing our own deaths—even if we do not die, our bodies will waste away, neither large nor small remaining. Our kin will be filled with sorrow, weeping in distress. We beseech the Great Kings and peerless divine lords to grant us life.”\n\nThen the Three-Modes Divine Mantra King addressed the ghost kings: “You all, from the past until now, have not believed in the supreme Dao, nor followed the true and correct. Instead, you harm and kill one another, cycling through karmic retribution, your kalpas exhausted, your evil karma not yet spent. Now, in the Nine Dark Realms, you suffer great retribution. If any among your kin could take your place, would that be just? There is no such principle. I, following the Heavenly Worthy, traverse the Three Realms, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the lands of the ten directions, the Five Paths and Eight Gates, witnessing all good and evil as clearly as an echo responds to sound, with no escape. If you now can universally instruct your kin not to harm the people, I will command the people of the world to prepare, according to their means, rare delicacies and fine foods, whether by day or night, in their cities, villages, hamlets, or tranquil dwellings, to set out offerings for you, ensuring you are sated and forever free from hunger and thirst. They will also provide you with clothing, money, and silk, for your use. Without incurring deep enmity, you will receive food and sustenance, your lives fully provided for. Is this not joyous?”\n\nThereupon, the plague-spreading ghost kings and all their kin rejoiced, bowing their heads to the Dao Lord and the Three-Modes Divine Mantra King: “We will follow your teachings and obey your commands.”\n\nAt that time, the Realized One Wei Mingluo and the Three-Modes Heavenly King, bearing the mandate of the Most High, addressed the Five Marchmounts’ Chief Administrators, the Four Seas’ Wardens, and the Village Community Deities: “You must now universally proclaim to all in the world: when the Three Calamities are about to arise and pestilence is set to spread, at the beginnings of the four seasons or in places afflicted by illness, the people—good men and good women, in cities, villages, hamlets, or noble and humble dwellings—should unite in mind and recite together, inviting Daoist masters. They should also have men and women wear talismans and amulets, bathe in fragrant waters, abstain from alcohol, meat, pungent and raw foods, and maintain purity while setting up vegetarian feasts. They should perform prostrations, chant praises, and high-ranking Dharma masters should contemplate the true, donning reverent attire, hanging silk banners and canopies, burning incense and scattering flowers, lighting lamps, and offering thanks. Some may play pure music to summon the hidden and manifest, setting out pure vegetarian delicacies to offer to the Three Worthies and the thirty-six heavens’ spontaneous deities, ensuring all are sated. According to their wealth or poverty and local resources, whether abundant or modest, they should express their sincere devotion, burning incense while circumambulating or sitting upright, silently contemplating, sounding drums, practicing breath control, reciting the names of the ghosts, and invoking the names of our divine kings. They should focus their minds in prostration to the Three-*Qi* Three Heavens’ Sovereign Deities, the Primordial Four Directions, the Thirty-Six Heavens’ Nine Palaces, the Five Marchmounts’ True Officials, and the Correct Deities—spontaneous, perfectly true, the source of great wisdom, responding to circumstances and seizing opportunities, wielding boundless divine power and majesty. They will swiftly arrive, entering the ritual space to receive the offerings and fulfill the vows, bringing harmony and joy, so that humans and ghosts rejoice together, neither harming the other.”\n\nHaving heard the Dharma-sound and beheld the Heavenly Writings of the Three Sovereigns and the Jade Texts in Five Scrolls—all imbued with numinous *qi*—each is content in their lot, embodying the Dao in its spontaneity. The four seasons harmonize, the world attains Great Peace, and both the sovereign and the people receive the Dao of Non-Action, ascending in name to the Jade Purity. The divine and the perfected commune in unity, and all is tranquil.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Maiden, the Great Brahmā King, the thirty-six heavens’ lesser kings, the boundless flying deities of the Three Realms, the Five Marchmounts’ Chief Administrators, the sons of Brahmā, the Heavenly Maiden of Many Hearings, and all demon-kings pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthy.\n\nThey further hear the Heavenly Kings of the Samādhi Divine Mantras, who entreat the essential teachings to deliver and uplift sentient beings, granting blessings in life and death. Heaven-dwellers and humans rejoice, praising what they have never before heard or seen. The *Dongyuan* Divine Mantras, majestic in power, defy description. As one, they rise, bow their heads in reverence, prostrate themselves, and kneel in devotion, vowing to cultivate the Way, each awakening gradually to the Perfect Truth.\n\nThen the Heavenly King of the Samādhi Divine Mantras commands the thirty-six heavens’ flying deities and other divine kings to each strike the celestial instruments, the great music of cloud-like *fangtian* chimes, in praise of the Dao Lord.\n\nThereupon, the Radiant Perfected One of the Azure Net offers a hymn, singing:\nThe Perfect Truth’s essence is formless,\nWhat name could it ever possess?\nAdapting to things, it takes shape,\nMajestic, foremost among all.\nTaking refuge, transgressions dissolve,\nDisasters gathered—no fault but one’s own.\nNon-being is not the absence of non-being,\nBeing is not the presence of being.\n\nThe Heavenly Maiden of Many Hearings also offers a hymn, singing:\nProfound grace, ever serene,\nSupreme among the exalted.\nUniversally bestowing the medicine of non-birth,\nIt heals all undying souls.\nCalled a mantra, yet still a mantra,\nIts vehicle races, its body too flees.\nForever transcending the Five Sufferings’ abode,\nIt ultimately enters the Gate of Spontaneity.\n\nThe Divine King Juliu offers a hymn, singing:\nThe Crimson Chaos of the Great Non-Being’s Origin,\nThe numinous treasure’s divine name.\nThe myriad existences are Non-Action,\nThe spontaneous, true, unified Dao.\nGood arises not from another,\nEvil is born from self-examination.\nMastering the Four Delusions’ confusion,\nWhy sever the Three Afflictions?\n\nThe Divine King Jumin’s son offers a hymn, singing:\nThe Perfect Truth, formless in name,\nForcibly called the Dharma King.\nIts responsive bodies follow the myriad existences,\nDeliverance is truly without limit.\nWith a sincere heart, uphold the divine mantra,\nEvil ghosts transform into goodness.\nThe Six Sensations free from attachment—\nWhat worry that life will not be long?\n\nThe Flying Celestial Brahmā-son offers a hymn, singing:\nExcellent is the land of the Square Cauldron,\nFortune and blessings descend from the celestial perfected.\nPitiful are those who race in competition,\nValuing others while demeaning themselves.\nNot knowing true knowledge, they seek illusory gods,\nWandering in delusion, chasing external spirits.\nReturn to the land of the True Unity,\nPreserve the people of spontaneity.\n\nAll the immortals, perfected beings, and celestial multitudes rejoice, praising what they have never before heard or seen. They bow twice, prostrate themselves, and chant their assent, vowing to uphold and practice.\n\nThus concludes *The Supreme Dongyuan Divine Mantras Sutra*, Scroll Eleven.\n*The Supreme Dongyuan Divine Mantras Sutra*, Scroll Twelve.\n\nThe Chapter on the Host of Sages Protecting the Body and Dispelling Disasters\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Five Venerable Lords of the Five Directions, the Nine Celestial Divine Kings, the Perfected Beings of the Ten Directions, and the assembly of divine immortals and sages, saying: \"I have often observed that within the Three Realms and the myriad existences, across the Five Paths and Eight Gates, whether celestial beings or humans, men or women, all sentient beings possessing consciousness and nature—whether in the heavens or hells—experience suffering and joy as cause and effect, like echo answering sound, interdependent and endless. Sinking into the cycles of death and rebirth, they cannot liberate themselves. Yet when reflection arises in the heart, the Dao transforms and awakens, guiding those who turn toward it into the source of the Way.\n\nSince time immemorial, I have acted as a compassionate father and mother to you, the beings of the Three Realms and Five Paths, and all living creatures, teaching and guiding you across kalpas through karmic conditions. At times, I manifest in various forms—bodies, names, titles, voices, and speech—responding to the needs of beings, harmoniously expounding the teachings. The Dharma-voices of the Three Caverns, the ten divisions of wondrous scriptures, and the Dharma-boats I have established universally ferry all beings. I open the celestial vehicle of the Dao, gathering those with aspiration, delivering the multitude from the net of craving, shattering deluded views, and transcending the dualities of emptiness and existence.\n\nYet all sentient beings, lifetime after lifetime, bind themselves through habitual karmic conditions, deluded by false perceptions. Their natures drift, their emotions wander, and in their ignorance and confusion, they obscure their own minds. The Three Corpses and Nine Worms cannot be cast aside; karmic retributions for evil deeds follow them, causing self-inflicted birth and death, chronic illness, prolonged misfortune, bodily and mental afflictions, and the torment of demonic qi and malevolent spirits, which seize upon transgressions and sink them into entanglement.\n\nIf one wishes to dispel these, one must contemplate one’s own body, observing the root of arising and ceasing, the advance and retreat of good and evil. Extinguish thoughts and still the void; contemplate the Three Treasures, cultivate kindness, frugality, and yielding, and turn toward the Seven Perfected. Embrace the Void and the Utmost Real—the Dao within the Dao.\n\nNoble lords and ladies, Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, by your divine names and titles, the Eight Purities of the Great Simplicity, and the Nine Qi Primordial Ladies—arouse the mind, visualize, and adorn your appearance and attire. Follow the flourishing of qi, practice exhalation and inhalation, recite and chant, keeping the mind undistracted. Receive and uphold the precious scriptures and talismanic contracts, hang banners and erect floral offerings, burn incense and light lamps. With tranquil intention, focus the mind and voice to make vows, repenting and atoning for the sins of past lives and the deceased, the karmic roots of transgressions, the retributions of misfortune, and the consequences of past deeds. Gradually, these will be dissolved.\n\nIf a Daoist cultivating immortality recites this scripture, wisdom will open and the six senses will become clear. For chronic or stubborn illnesses, reciting this scripture will fill one with true qi, restoring health. When tormented by demonic or malevolent spirits, recite this scripture while sounding the drum of command, striking bells and chimes. Malevolent entities will vanish, and the hun and shen will stabilize. In hunger, thirst, cold, or heat, or when lodging alone in the mountains or wilderness, recite this scripture, practice exhalation and inhalation, and swallow saliva. Divine medicines will descend, warming the cold and sating hunger. When heaven and earth undergo transformation, the Five Phases announce disasters, the stars and constellations manifest omens, or strange signs appear in the hidden or manifest realms, recite this scripture, and malevolent intentions will submit. In times of war, pestilence, or the spread of death and disease, recite this scripture, and blades will blunt, demonic spirits will perish.\n\nYou, the perfected immortals, entrusted with governance, should proclaim these secret essentials to save the multitude of beings. Let those with aspiration transcend all obstacles and afflictions, attain peace in this life, and later achieve the perfection of the Dao. Extinguish thoughts and forget them; practice benevolence, filial piety, and respect. Put others before oneself, promote goodness and transform evil. Sail the great Dharma-boat into the sea of wisdom, unstained by the Three Bonds, guarding the True Unity. Return the two halves to their original state, merging obscurely with spontaneity.\"\n\nThereupon, the Five Venerable Lords of the Five Directions, the flying celestials of the Ten Directions, and the Seven Sage Immortals all rose, bowed, circumambulated three times, knelt before the Dao, and each presented what they had received in the past—the essentials of the Dao, divine mantras, talismanic recitations, and true instructions. After the Three Dragons, they saved myriad beings. For faithful men and women who, with sincere devotion, humility, and perseverance, have yearned for years with unwavering resolve, spurning wealth to honor the Dao, and those of single-minded sincerity, they should follow the Bright Regulations of the Four Poles and the ancient canons of the Three Primes, purifying themselves for three months. If royal duties intervene, complete one seven-day period or three seven-day periods. Transcribe and secretly transmit these teachings; careless disclosure or disrespect will bring the wind-blade to examine the body. How can one not be cautious?\n\n**The Meaning of the Divine Mantra and Talisman for Protecting the Body by the Mysterious Perfected**\n\nThe Seven Perfected said: \"We have expounded that all the celestial sages who have attained the Dao, from countless eons past, have transmitted and received these teachings. Daoist men and women, regardless of status or age, who uphold, remember, and recite them—when ill, recite; when in disaster, recite; when facing misfortune, recite; when in peril, recite; when in distress, recite; when in sorrow, recite; when in joy, recite.\n\nLong ago, with the Mysterious Perfected, we expounded the scriptures of the Three Treasures, which have already been fully recorded. Those who uphold them to save the world treasure them in their hearts, preserving the body and nurturing nature to attain the Dao of non-action. May the Heavenly Perfected save me, the Orthodox Perfected sustain me, the Utmost Perfected guard me, the Mysterious Perfected protect me, the Wondrous Perfected remember me, the Jade Perfected shield me, the Golden Perfected aid me, the Seven Perfected deliver me, the Nine Perfected preserve me. May the Dharma-mirror illuminate me, the Mysterious Spirit shade me, the Flowing Gold radiate me, the Dharma-vehicle transport me, the Dharma-power defend me, the Dharma-merit perfect me. May the morning lamp shine upon me, its brilliance dazzling me. May the misty qi hasten me, the light of compassion crown me, the cloud encampment cover me. May the Mysterious Sages comfort me, the Dharma King receive me. May the celestial spirits dispel disasters for me, the myriad spirits deliver me from peril, the earth deities ward off evil for me, the myriad emperors eliminate misfortune for me, the host of sages avert calamity for me. May the Seven Perfected grant me bodily peace, the Nine Perfected ensure my longevity.\"\n\n**The Hymn of the Mysterious Perfected for Dispelling Disasters and Averting Misfortune**\n\nThe Golden Perfected descends through empty space,\nDivine tigers inspect the cloud encampment.\nThe Jade Emperor dons green mist,\nThe myriad heavens command divine soldiers.\nThe Nine Stars turn their celestial chariots,\nThe ten thousand demons bind their demonic forms.\nThe Nine Subtleties swiftly send forth mist,\nDivine generals seize malevolent spirits.\nThe Nine Primes open the cloud paths,\nDivine might summons all spirits.\nFlowing Gold hurls its keen blades,\nAll evils dissolve and vanish.\n\n**Divine radiance illumines the celestial lodges,**\n**Eradicating the demon kings’ armies.**\n**The Five Symbols unleash wind and fire,**\n**Vanquishing poison as the Golden Horse appears.**\n**Should any calamities dare encroach,**\n**The Northern Emperor records your name.**\n**The sagely Dao is vast and unobstructed,**\n**Divine might slays demonic essences.**\n**Dragon-riders arrive from the ten directions,**\n**Divine clouds encircle the demon city.**\n**The sages teach me to recite,**\n**Flying talismans ascend through the heavens’ expanse.**\n**The ten directions safeguard the kalpa’s fate,**\n**Granting me smoothness, prosperity, and integrity.**\n\n**The Hymn of the Mysterious Perfected for Dispelling Malevolent Spirits and Demons of the Five Directions**\n\n**Dharma drums shake heaven and earth,**\n**Divine smoke subdues the Nine Perfected.**\n**Flowing Gold scatters and falls,**\n**The Great Image follows lightning’s birth.**\n**Demon winds cannot reverse fate,**\n**Cloud Lords gleam with fire-bells.**\n**Resplendent, divine power seizes,**\n**Celestial lodges remain unwaning.**\n**Swift wheels and fire-armor surge,**\n**Divine lightning slays demonic forms.**\n**Purple radiance guards against poisonous dragons,**\n**Banishing demons to the northern frontier.**\n**Divine winds rage through the Nine Gorges,**\n**The Eight Paths naturally brighten.**\n**Suddenly, the Nine Heavens open,**\n**Demons wail and collapse.**\n**Thousands upon thousands come bound,**\n**Myriad upon myriad do not linger.**\n**This talisman is bestowed upon heaven’s people—**\n**Recite it to safeguard ten thousand ages.**\n**Above, celebrate the eternal absence of kalpas,**\n**Compassionate hearts bring great peace.**\n**Observe purity in silent stillness,**\n**Countless eons shall flourish.**\n**Circulate it swiftly as lightning,**\n**The myriad heavens benefit your name.**\n**Let each person recite it once,**\n**To protect their children with eternal prosperity.**\n\n**The Hymn of the Seven Perfected Commanding the Ten Heavenly Emperors to Seize the Six Heavens’ Demon Soldiers**\n\n**I command the Ten Heavenly Emperors,**\n**Vast and mighty, to display their might.**\n**Divine generals traverse the earthly paths,**\n**Seizing the Six Heavens’ demonic hordes.**\n**Smoke and flames arise in the void,**\n**Brocade clouds brush the divine winds.**\n**Above, protect the heavens’ blessings—**\n**How could the mysterious signs ever end?**\n**At the center, secure the emperors’ foundations,**\n**Spiritual transformations dance with divine bells.**\n**Below, save heaven, earth, and humanity,**\n**Flying riders subdue demon lords.**\n**The Seven Luminaries hurl divine light,**\n**No evil can bring misfortune.**\n**The Ten Heavens dispatch the talisman,**\n**The myriad emperors respond like cloud-dragons.**\n**Gently passing through the Eight Perils,**\n**The Five Paths are all cleansed.**\n**The Five Emperors issue their decrees,**\n**Swift as water, fire, and wind.**\n**Guard against the Three Calamities,**\n**The ten directions rejoice in abundance.**\n**Universal celestial jubilation,**\n**Boundless protection and grace.**\n\n**The Seven Perfected say:**\n**Should heavenly beings take refuge, receive, and uphold this talisman, inscribing it once and reciting its incantations, it shall accompany them at life’s end, ensuring their souls avoid the Ten Sufferings, Eight Perils, Three Realms, Five Paths, and Six Destinies. In death and life, they shall be guided, the talisman escorting their spirits to the Ten Directions’ Hall of Non-Action and Blessing. Recite it nine times for divine peace, ten times for clarity, a hundred times to dispel calamities, a thousand times to avert afflictions. Whether worn or recited, the myriad spirits shall pay homage, day and night ever guarding, the four limbs wholly at peace. Constant recitation brings bodily ease, preserving form through ten thousand kalpas, crushing all evils. The myriad heavens heed, the demon kings of the ten directions dare not ignore its sound.**\n\n**The Seven Perfected say:**\n**Now, this Dharma is eternally transmitted to future generations, safeguarding and delivering boundless heavenly beings through endless kalpas.**\n\n**At that time, among the assembly were Heavenly Soldiers, Divine Warriors, and the Sentient Sons, who together rose, bowed, and knelt, focusing their minds to address the Heavenly Worthy:**\n**\"We reflect upon our karmic fortunes through countless kalpas, having the fortune to behold your august countenance and partake in this joyous gathering. Witnessing the Great Kings expound the essential Dharma, we rejoice beyond measure at their vow to save all beings, deliver them from suffering, and guide them into the Dao’s gate.**\n\n**\"Formerly, in the land of Sudarśana, we received divine incantations from the Nine Heavens’ Perfected. Though we received their teachings, our minds remained confused and uncomprehending. Only through long devotion, strictly adhering to the oral instructions—bowing, reciting, and meditating without cease—did our spirits accumulate resonance, and the Dao’s qi gradually flow. Gradually, we attained awakening, though our minds’ understanding remained incomplete. Observing our own bodies and minds, we saw only illusory emptiness, growing ever more alarmed and terrified, with nowhere to turn. We then sought the True Sovereign, beseeching compassionate aid.**\n\n**The True Sovereign gazed at us for a long while, eyes smiling, and said:**\n**\"You demon kings, since ancient times, have followed qi’s ebb and flow, transforming at will, believing yourselves eternal. Yet your minds drift and wander, falsely distinguishing right from wrong, arising and ceasing in karmic bonds. Deluded and racing, you seek to harm others, yet only harm yourselves, lingering in the Five Paths, bound at the Eight Gates. How could you ever escape?**\n\n**\"If you can cease the Six Passions, follow the Two Existences, cultivate the true Dao’s reality, and refrain from generating thoughts of approach or aversion, then you may enter the Dao. Yet even this ‘entering’ is but a name—only by harmonizing with all dharmas and aligning with nature can you be free from fear.**\n\n**\"Your bodies and minds are but temporary constructs of the Two Existences, fundamentally unreal. How could deluded minds give rise to terror?\"**\n\n**The Sentient Sons said:**\n**\"Now, by the Heavenly Worthy’s grace, you have shown us the path of non-arising, the Dharma of non-mind, granting us the fearless mantra. We shall cultivate with true resolve, free from attachment to approach or aversion, practicing skillfully without defilement, harmonizing our endeavors to guide others into the Dao’s source.**\n\n**\"Now, we proclaim this divine incantation, universally bestowing it upon heavenly beings. Those who aspire with devoted hearts shall attain peace.\"**\n\n**And they spoke the incantation:**\n**Primordial Great Unity,**\n**Nine qi transform and give birth.**\n**Radiant essence surges and shines,**\n**Flowing Gold and fire-bells.**\n**Vibrant and resplendent,**\n**Embracing the moon and spitting stars.**\n**Poisonous dragons hurl fire,**\n**Raven-Mother holds the vase.**\n**Summon and seize the Six Feng,**\n**Behead and slay demonic forms.**\n**Ānā sounds the drum,**\n**Divine clouds erect the bells.**\n**Search the heavens with axes,**\n**Long fangs array tassels.**\n**Bind wind and fire,**\n**Hunt and capture demonic essences.**\n**Gather and record radiance,**\n**No names are spared.**\n**The Six Heavens’ old qi—**\n**What rebellion remains unquelled?**\n**The Five Emperors’ talismanic decree,**\n**Golden Horses speed the message.**\n**Hasten! As the Most High’s Law commands!**\n\n**The Three Heavenly True Kings’ Incantation for Dispelling Epidemics and Transforming Celestial Lodges**\n\n**Radiant essence’s central king,**\n**Might shakes the Nine Heavens.**\n**Golden tigers obscure the sun,**\n**Flying dragons encircle the heavens.**\n**Yellow spirits wield halberds,**\n**Green-teethed ones brandish whips.**\n**The Jade Balance and Five Ladles,**\n**Harmonizing the Seven Primes.**\n\n**Seize and capture the Nine Shameful Ones,**\n**Slay and extinguish the Six Heavens.**\n**Hands grasp the Three Radiances,**\n**Feet tread the Nine Mysteries.**\n**Eight Mighties spew poison,**\n**Heavenly Soldiers lead the way.**\n**Hunt and examine demonic essences,**\n**Consign them to the Nine Springs.**\n**The Ten Heavens guard the realm,**\n**All things secure in peace.**\n\nThe Three Heavenly True Ones declare:\nIn future kalpas, those who study the Dao and seek truth—devout men and women—whether dwelling in official rank, secluded in mountains and forests, or hidden in court and marketplace, when they encounter the *yang jiu bai liu* (the baleful cycle of nine and six), the juncture of adversity and prosperity, when their destined term arrives and karmic misfortunes converge—blade and warfare, flood and fire, epidemics and famine—when myriad disasters arise, they should steady their minds, guard their resolve, and disengage from worldly affairs. Purify themselves in fasting rites, burn incense and light lamps, or practice visualization and breath regulation, sounding drums and striking bells and chimes. With every four words, bow once; inner and outer spirits unite. From the crown, nine lights emerge, illuminating the Three Realms. The head bears the Seven Stars, the *qi* of the Northern Dipper surging before them. The kingly *qi* and cloudy radiance issue from the Five Viscera, enveloping the body, filling the Eight Extremities, transforming into dragons, tigers, lions, and demon-quelling beasts. They charge before and behind, each conforming to its directional color, exhaling their kingly *qi*, streaming forth golden fire and ringing bells, dispelling calamities.\n\nThereupon, the celestial hosts—supreme sages and perfected immortals—universally descend. The Five Emperors escort them, delivering them from pestilence and disaster, guiding them into the source of the Dao. A universal proclamation is made to future generations: devout men and women who turn their hearts toward this path shall surely attain peace. Cultivate non-action, nurture the spirit, and naturally return. Hold fast to my Three Treasures, focus the mind without distraction. For one seven-day period, two seven-day periods, or even three months, burn incense and bow in worship to the Most High Jade Emperor, the Eight Pure Dao Lords, the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Boundless Heavenly Worthies, the Nine Palaces’ Four Poles’ Supreme Clarity Divine Officials, and the host of perfected saints. Invoke their names, chant and recite their praises. With the three karmas established in goodness, ascend to the mysterious and profound. With sincere intent, one’s self evokes response—**the Dao does not forsake humanity.**\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy extols the Three Worthies in verse, saying:\n**The Great Dao has no coming or going,**\n**Things naturally follow and welcome it.**\n**Silent, it cannot be named,**\n**Yet breath and utterance are its names.**\n**Eternally abiding, without end or extinction,**\n**How could its responsive movement have a beginning?**\n**Now I bow my head in reverence,**\n**Pledging my life to the Jade Emperor’s court.**\n\n**Resplendent with dragon and phoenix script,**\n**Majestic radiance illumines the Ten Heavens.**\n**When resonance departs, it hides in golden registers;**\n**When mechanism arrives, it unfolds jade chapters.**\n**Empty sounds swell in splendid echoes,**\n**Manifesting and concealing as steps and pipes.**\n**Chanting and reciting, singing of nature and destiny,**\n**Harmonizing and flowing into the mysterious and profound.**\n\n**Majestic and towering, the Dao’s honored one,**\n**Whose merit and conduct are already complete and equal.**\n**Descending to receive me,**\n**Masters and guardians escort me side by side.**\n**With compassion, bestowing the Dharma-water of wisdom,**\n**To wash away delusion and confusion.**\n**Forever crossing to the Three Clarities’ shore,**\n**Ever parting from the Five Turbidities’ mire.**\n\nThe Perfected Sovereign then extols the Three Worthies, having uttered his vows, saying:\nToday, for the sake of future kalpas, I employ the Orthodox Dharma to nurture and protect all beings. Adapting to worldly customs, I teach and transform, practicing the Great Vehicle’s Dao, entering all directions in accord with their affairs. Through karmic conditions and retributions, I offer skillful means and benefits. Establishing fasting rites and practicing the Dao, I enable the cultivation of vows and mindfulness. The Four Great Elements unite in virtue, merging into a single source.\n\n**First vow:** May the Great Dao’s profound profundity, the true source’s emptiness and stillness, remain undiminished in wisdom though realms rise and fall.\n**Second vow:** May the Nine Heavens be clear and bright, the Seven Luminaries lofty and luminous. May primordial essence harmonize and descend, nourishing all beings.\n**Third vow:** May the Nine Earths be tranquil, mountains and rivers fertile. May myriad plants ever flourish, sweet springs increase, and all sentient and formed beings receive sustenance and nurturance.\n**Fourth vow:** May the Heavenly Sovereign govern with sagely assistance, the unseen and manifest realms receiving grace. May all things—moving and still—thrive in harmony, preserving the great foundation in abundance and peace.\n**Fifth vow:** May the Three Masters and Dao companions universally attain the Six Penetrations. May virtue fill them, wisdom and eloquence enlighten the ignorant. In hidden or manifest worldly paths, may all things harmonize. May minds remain unstained, bodies soar in the Great Void.\n**Sixth vow:** May the Eight Gates and Five Paths’ karmic retributions be dissolved. May evil destinies be forever severed, good fortunes eternally abide. May souls don crowns and sashes, clothed and fed from the celestial kitchens.\n**Seventh vow:** May crawling, flying, wriggling, and moving beings—born or unborn—be nourished by primordial essence, preserving their natures in peace. May all enjoy joy and prosperity, receiving delight and glory.\n**Eighth vow:** May all be universally uplifted, ascending together to Jade Clarity. With minds fixed on the mysterious and tranquil, may people attain perfection through the Dao. May all return to blessed fruits, the Dao’s *qi* prolonging life.\n\n**The Five Elder Thearchs’ Divine Incantation for Protecting the Realm and Dispelling Disasters for Immortal Aspirants**\n\nAt that time, the Five Elder Thearchs rose together, bowed again, adjusted their robes, composed their countenances, and knelt before the honored one, addressing him thus:\nFor kalpas uncounted, we have followed the cycles, manifesting and concealing, receiving the Numinous Treasure and constantly employing skillful means to deliver and cross over sentient beings, guiding them into the Orthodox Dharma of non-action and spontaneity. We clarify the worldly path’s origins, ends, conditions, and karmic retributions. Formerly, we received the true scriptures, incantations, and oral transmissions, treasuring them in mind and mouth, never daring to lightly disclose or leak their texts. Now, obeying your edict, we dare not conceal them. There is a divine incantation for protection and pacification, the wondrous root of the Three Caverns, the primordial essence of the Nine *Qi*, blending with the hundred spirits. Its inner name is hidden, its merits, wisdom, and radiance complete and luminous. Though mentioned in other scriptures, when practiced and recited, it inwardly mirrors body and mind, outwardly dispelling disasters. Only the lofty perfected sages can fully comprehend its profound principles, which are not revealed to lesser immortals. Later learners and ordinary deluded ones may transmit it only with sincere faith, closing their minds to practice it. Through pure fasting, silent meditation, visualizing the spirit-*qi*, sounding drums, regulating breath, focusing the mind in recitation, the true numina will swiftly descend, immediately enabling ascent to immortality. How much more so for minor calamities and dangers—how could they not be averted? With single-minded sincerity, one’s self evokes response—**the Dao does not forsake humanity.**\n\nNow reverently recited:\n\nThe primordial essence blends in chaos,\nAzure *qi* scatters and divides.\nTwelve divine youths guard and stabilize\nThe liver’s *hun*-soul, its root secure.\nTwo sevens, four fives—transforming cloud encampments,\nNine hearths, nine altars, ancient trees unyielding.\nThe divine tiger spews venom,\nSword cast, fire burns.\nSweeping away azure afflictions,\nDispersing ominous vapors of light and shadow.\nMind unshaken by delusion,\nSecurely safeguards the Imperial Lord.\n\nCrimson radiance unfolds the chart,\nFiery essence fans the whirlwind.\nThree youths in one dwelling,\nResplendent, floating and soaring.\nOverseeing gains and losses,\nMyriad emperors pay homage to the宗.\nThe vermilion phoenix breathes fire,\nMetal and stone melt away.\nFlying bells, flashing lightning,\nSlaying crimson demons in their domain.\nBinding the Nine Uglies,\nAsh covers, fire burns.\nPurifying the imperial reign,\nThe Dao and virtue wander free.\n\nGolden essence awakens once,\nVenus divides sevenfold.\nThe Imperial Lord’s numinous palace,\nDrifting with pale clouds.\nSummoning dragons to bear water,\nQuenching the blazing smoke.\nLong-fanged, colossal beasts,\nHunt and capture the malevolent horde.\nThe hundred spirits pacified,\nI attain spontaneity.\n\nMysterious radiance vast and clear,\nFive *qi* flow and circulate.\nBefore the twin gates of the Emperor,\nMyriad spirits transform and arise.\nCalm the will, guard wisdom,\nGaze upon and consume fiery essence.\nThe azure dragon spits lightning,\nShattering the yellow troops.\nBrilliant and crystalline, brandishing swords,\nFire sparks fly in pursuit.\nThe mighty warriors of the Three Heavens\nSeize and extinguish the ten thousand spirits.\nProtecting households, pacifying the realm,\nThe Dao governs, ascends to peace.\n\nChaos, the primordial One,\nYellow images rush in profusion.\nMoved by the True Elder’s grace,\nTransforming into the infant.\nNurturing the nine *qi*,\nGiving birth to the Two Modes.\nSun and moon ascend,\nStars and constellations descend.\nWind and fire clash,\nBlades and swords race in chaos.\nThe Six Heavens, Nine Uglies—\nScattering the heart’s disunion.\nThe Most High’s talismanic command,\nHow dare one not follow?\n\nAll beings dwell in peace,\nEntering the Dao’s non-action.\nAt this time, the Perfected One, Weiming Luo, by the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, addressed the great assembly, saying: “All perfected immortals and transcendents! If in future ages you universally succor the multitude of immortals, rescue the distressed, cure illnesses, establish fasts, perform the Dao, recite incantations, and offer reverent worship, you must also prepare cinnabar and vermilion, plain paper and ink, to inscribe and paint divine talismans. Hang them for protection, wear them on your person, present memorials, and summon the divine officials, soldiers, and encampments of the Great Clarity and Great Ultimate to decisively punish malevolent spirits and demonic thieves.\n\nYet the celestial writings are profoundly wondrous—all are the precise forms of the nine *qi* and the names of the hundred spirits, their shifting appearances and signs, the intricate patterns of their script, the hidden rhymes of their inner names. Established by the majesty and power of their numinous efficacy, they can extinguish calamities and anomalies, preserve and nourish primordial harmony, and guard the twelve double-hours, gates and doors, wells and hearths, latrines and cesspits.\n\nThe reason is this: when ordinary people dwell in the world, they may become confused and lost, not yet having entered the Orthodox Unity’s covenant of awe-inspiring might, the numinous treasure’s fountain of grace. Their natures and emotions drift and taint, their minds unsettled, deludedly giving rise to fear. The Six Heavens and Nine Uglies, perceiving their hearts in motion, thereby generate disasters and harms. Thus, one must employ divine talismans for protection, true *qi* for defense, aligning with spontaneity to attain stability.\n\nFor those suffering illness, they should also swallow the talismans, cultivate visualization, recite the incantations, perform the Dao thrice daily, face north in the courtyard, invoke the divine soldiers, present memorials and petitions, burn incense and light lamps, hang silk banners and floral streamers, circumambulate while singing hymns. The majestic rites of the Dharma-realm should fully accord with the Three Records, the Four Poles’ Luminous Perfection, the precepts, statutes, and laws. To lightly divulge or negligently profane them brings calamity extending to the nine generations.”\n\nWeiming Luo, the Perfected King, stepped before the great assembly, bowed twice, and knelt. Raising a jade table, he opened a golden casket, burned a hundred precious incenses, sounded the drum, and held his breath, demonstrating the ritual norms to the assembly. He unfolded the jade tablet and inscribed it to transmit the announcement.\n\nThereupon, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords of Julou and others all rose, bowed twice, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “From former times until now, we have received the essential incantations of the Dharma’s savor and truth, all of which we have expounded. Now, may the great assembly of heavenly beings, humans, and divine immortals, each in their own lands, rescue and deliver those in suffering, exalt the sagely Dao, protect the state and pacify the people, broadly propagate the great Dharma, and universally deliver the boundless.\n\nWe clearly proclaim to the men and women of future generations and the latter age: those who can turn toward and single-mindedly believe should receive the command, silk, cinnabar, and pigments, establish vows and fasts, and report as the statutes of the Luminous Perfected prescribe. Also offer precious, fine, and sweet fruits—the flavors we present—to the Five Emperors, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords, and the venerable divine lords of spontaneity, to seek their desired blessings.”\n\nThe various Perfected Kings, unable to contain their joy, with different bodies but one mind, sang in praise:\n\nWisdom’s abyss, deep and clear as the sea,\nDharma-water ever brimming full.\nSilent, no one calls its name,\nYet when moved, it bears merit’s fame.\nThe nature of form stirs the divine incantations,\nRevealing the *Dongyuan* scriptures’ depths.\nHarming none, aiding all beings,\nThus moved, the Worthy manifests form.\nDescending to transform the lands of Fangzhu,\nAscending in flight to the Jade Capital’s Dao.\nNeither coming nor going,\nNeither perishing nor arising.\nResplendent with dragon-phoenix script,\nSeparating and uniting, tracing divine talismans.\nWorldly sentiments distinguish noble and base,\nBut the Dao makes no distinction between wise and foolish.\nWith sincere heart, blessings arise,\nThrough divulgence and negligence, fortune departs.\nGood and evil are not others’ opposites,\nRising and sinking accompany the self.\nIn the end, all return to our Three Treasures.\nDark grace may yet support.\nHard to encounter, now we attain it—\nThe sagely Dao’s incantations and talismans.\nA lifetime’s joy and fortune,\nTen thousand kalpas’ finest affinity.\nSentient beings receive as they feel,\nUnmoved hearts do not meet transmission.\nThe Eight Gates sever karmic retribution,\nNine generations together ascend.\nDispersing and gathering, rejoicing in song,\nBowing before the Imperial Lord.\n\nAt the Dharma assembly’s conclusion, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Five Elders to harness their chariots to the ten directions. The divine immortals all rose and bowed twice. Transforming into Eight Radiance bodies, cloud carriages flying like wheels, resplendent and dazzling, the celestial harmony resounded. Heavenly perfected ones led the procession, riding the void, ascending to the Jade Clarity.\n\nThus concludes the twelfth scroll of the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Incantations of the Abyssal Cavern*.\nBeginning the thirteenth scroll of the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Incantations of the Abyssal Cavern*.\n\n**Chapter of the Dragon Kings**\n\nThe Dao spoke: Long ago, upon the Three Heavens, I observed the world below. I beheld the myriad heavens and earths, where pestilential qi spread unchecked. People suffered from illness, lands endured scorching droughts, and the five grains failed to yield. In twos and threes, none knew what to do.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy rode upon a five-colored cloud, descending upon the lands. Manifesting great divine power, he radiated luminous brilliance, accompanied by over seven thousand two hundred Dragon Kings, immortal youths, and jade maidens. Proclaiming the true Dharma, he universally delivered all beings. A great deluge poured forth, timely and sweetly moistening the earth.\n\nYou must not harbor disbelief, lest calamity sink nine generations of ancestors, their suffering souls bound within the offices of ghostly officials, never to escape for a hundred kalpas or a thousand rebirths. But if you diligently cultivate the heart, receive, uphold, recite, and chant, the merit will be profound and far-reaching. The people will know no disaster, each extending their years in longevity, free from harm.\n\nThe Dao spoke: When a kingdom faces peril, weapons clash, people devour one another, heaven and earth quake, and the sun and moon lose their light—then in the auspicious direction of blessings and virtue, within palace gardens or where springs and pools reside, establish the positions of the Nine Dragons and the forms of the Five Sages. Turn your thoughts to this sutra, and pay homage to the August Emperor of the Void to pacify the realm. The Heavenly Dragons will respond: demonic vapors will vanish of themselves, warfare will cease, ruler and ministers will follow the Dao, dragon virtue will aid them, and the world will know great peace, ever abiding in prosperity.\n\nAt that time, the assembly of immortals, hearing this exposition, all received benefit and universal grace. All sentient beings bowed in reverence, each vowing to receive and uphold it.\n\n**The Supreme Abyssal Summons of the Myriad Heavenly Dragon Kings, Most Wondrous Chapter**\n\nEast: Azure Emperor, Azure Dragon King\nSouth: Vermilion Emperor, Vermilion Dragon King\nWest: White Emperor, White Dragon King\nNorth: Black Emperor, Black Dragon King\nCenter: Yellow Emperor, Yellow Dragon King\nSun and Moon Dragon Kings\nConstellation Dragon Kings\nHeavenly Palace Dragon King\nDragon Palace Dragon King\nHeavenly Gate Dragon King\nYama Dragon King\nHell Dragon King\nHeavenly Virtue Dragon King\nEarthly Virtue Dragon King\nHeavenly Being Dragon King\nFlying Being Dragon King\nLotus Dragon King\nFlower Grove Dragon King\nFive Marchmounts Dragon King\nMountains and Rivers Dragon King\nAdditionally:\nDemon-Slaying Dragon King\n*Kāla* Ghost-Swallowing Dragon King\nLesser Auspicious Dragon King\nGreater Auspicious Dragon King\nGolden Radiance Dragon King\nGolden Hue Dragon King\nYang Qi Dragon King\nYin Qi Dragon King\nMedicinal Dragon King\nLion Dragon King\nRealm-Preserving Dragon King\nDwelling-Preserving Dragon King\nWealth Dragon King\nWell and Hearth Dragon King\nGold and Silver Dragon King\nTreasure Dragon King\nStorehouse Dragon King\nProsperity Dragon King\nFive Ridges Dragon King\nFive Grains Dragon King\nGolden-Headed Dragon King\nClothing and Sustenance Dragon King\nOfficial Rank Dragon King\nOfficial Emolument Dragon King\nRiver and Sea Dragon King\nCloud Sea Dragon King\nHuai Sea Dragon King\nMountain Sea Dragon King\nAbyssal Sea Dragon King\nLand Dragon King\nPrefecture and County Dragon King\nCity Dragon King\nSpirit Altar Dragon King\nWind Earl Dragon King\nVibrating Dragon King\nCloud and Rain Dragon King\nGreat Rain Dragon King\nScattering Water Dragon King\nHeavenly Rain Dragon King\n\nThe Dao spoke: I declare to all beings—when reciting the divine incantations and wondrous sutras of the Heavenly Dragon Kings I have expounded, you must burn incense and chant for three days and three nights, universally summoning the Heavenly Dragons. In times of drought, rain will fall. Though thunder and lightning arise, no harm will come. The dragons will descend, fulfilling every wish. Whether seeking blessings, virtue, longevity, official rank for sons or daughters, healing for the people’s illnesses, protection for dwellings in peril, resolution of all enmities, or legal disputes—none will fail to prosper.\n\nAs for you, demon kings and all wayward ghosts: if you hear this sutra and do not depart, your heads will shatter into seven pieces, your roots utterly severed. Those this sutra subdues will submit; those it dispels will retreat.\n\nIf lands, cities, towns, or villages frequently suffer from heavenly fires, let every household first inscribe the names of the Four Seas’ Dragon Kings and place them at the four corners of their dwellings. Then, burn incense and uphold the recitation, and the Water Dragons will come to guard. The Eastern Sea Dragon King of the East, the Southern Sea Dragon King of the South, the Western Sea Dragon King of the West, and the Northern Sea Dragon King of the North—each will soar through the void, manifesting divine transformations. In an instant, they will spew ten thousand *shi* of water. The fire spirits, upon seeing it, will plunge a thousand feet into the earth. There is also the Great Water Dragon King, who presides over the center, guarding and pacifying each direction, sweeping away inauspiciousness.\n\nThe Dao spoke: For households of good men and good women who serve the Dragon Kings—if you inscribe the name of the Ever-Peaceful Dragon and place it within your storehouses, offering pure water and fresh fruits in timely devotion, or on the days of the new and full moon when dragons are worshipped, recite this sutra and invoke the Dragon Kings—your home will prosper in wealth, free from loss, your storehouses overflowing. The efficacy of this sutra is beyond measure.\n\nAt that time, the fourfold assembly, hearing this exposition, rejoiced immeasurably. Eighty-four thousand Dragon Kings leapt forth as one, heaven and earth trembled, divine dragons gathered, and a great deluge poured forth, universally delivering all beings. All heavenly and human beings simultaneously praised it, bowing their heads in reverence and vowing to uphold it.\n\nThe Dao spoke: By decree of Wang Lu and Li Zhong, the Daoist priestesses and female officials of Nanhai and Hailing, along with all Daoist followers, are to be universally informed. Since my transformation began fifty-three years ago, I have been sent by the Most High to traverse the Five Marchmounts, converting the ten directions, circling the world without fail, desiring to inaugurate a reign of Great Peace under a non-acting emperor. Yet the hearts of people today are shallow: the good are few, the wicked many.\n\nFrom this time forth until the *renwu* year, I shall dispatch seventy-two disciples to roam the world, teaching and transforming all beings, bestowing upon them the Dao’s qi.\n\nFor these people, greedy for wealth and sensual pleasures, falsely claim to be sages and worthies, deceiving and misleading the common folk—though they speak a thousand words or ten thousand, not one response shall they receive. Since the *jiazi* year, I have eliminated them by the Law, and of the remaining thirty-six, I now bestow upon them the Dao’s *qi*, that they may protect and sustain the ruler and the people. Exhort them to goodness—revere this, revere this!\n\nAt that time, the world’s fate pressed close, and evil men abounded. In the *jisi* year, on the third day of the third month, I dispatched ghostly soldiers from the ten directions to drive out the wicked, beginning at Huayin’s Western Marchmount. Now they have reached Mount Heng’s Southern Marchmount, erasing all traces, leaving not one in ten, their corpses strewn by the myriad, unburied and unhidden. Do you yet know this?\n\nFrom this time forth, every third day of the third month, I shall send a million ghostly soldiers from Mount Song, driving out the wicked between the lands of Nan, Ji, Ding, Guo, Huang, Bao, and Han, erasing all traces, leaving not one in ten. Now, with Mount Heng’s Northern Marchmount, I fear all shall be swept away. I tell you now: of foolish scholars, fewer than a hundred can see, and fewer than a thousand can act—yet they claim to know the distant past. How pitiable are the deaf and blind among the common folk!\n\nFrom Qing and Qi southward, to Yangzhou and north to Yan, these are lands of fortune. You must diligently perform purification rites, sweep and purify the altars—do not treat this as ordinary. In the *jiashen* year, I shall unleash a great flood to scour away the bones of the wicked. At that time, the myriad people shall be swept away. I now speak this especially to you, the faithful, that you may each know and instruct the Daoist followers, teaching and admonishing the disciples of the Law. Apply yourselves earnestly—do not treat this as ordinary.\n\nI see into your hearts: you have taken the incense and lamp offerings to feed your families and sustain yourselves, not as those of true devotion. I admonish you now—each of you must reform your hearts, diligently bestow charity upon the poor and needy, and never use wealth gained by unrighteous means. Waste nothing without reason. Poverty is not due to lack of fortune, nor is wealth the result of cunning—all is by my power, descending the Dao’s *qi*, my numinous might overshadowing, bringing it to pass.\n\nI come from the void, formed of accumulated *qi*, my movements leaving no trace, my presence casting no shadow, my hearing producing no sound, my sight taking no form. At times, I rise three feet from the heavens, or hover three feet above the earth; at others, I float three feet above men’s heads, witnessing all within the great earth below—what is there I do not see? How could you know whether my spirit is near or far? I do not reach the heavens above nor touch the earth below, drifting beside the Gate of Heaven and the Starry River. What do I seek? What do I desire? Only this: the myriad people are forlorn, the great flood approaches, a thousand calamities converge, driving out the wicked factions—ten thousand deaths, no life spared.\n\nWhen Great Peace emerges, heed my drum’s call. I shall instruct you, the Daoist priests and priestesses, and all of good heart among the various peoples. I know the celestial tribulation draws near, its time appointed. The year’s fate presses close—each of you must apply yourselves earnestly; do not treat this as ordinary. In the *renshen* year, I shall send forth a hundred diseases to purge the wicked.\n\nI speak now to those of good heart, that all may know. In the *guiyou* year, I shall dispatch three disciples, bearing a million talismans of divine truth, to traverse the Five Marchmounts. Those who receive these talismans shall be untouched by the myriad disasters, and no hundred ghosts shall draw near. In the *jiaxu* year, there shall appear a kind of yellow-robed messenger, indistinguishable from the wicked. You must tend to your incense and lamps diligently—do not be deluded by those who share your practice, mimicking this form. Before the incense and lamps, you shall witness Great Peace.\n\nI proclaim to the Daoist priests and priestesses within the Five Marchmounts and the Nine Provinces: at the end of the nine calamities, when the hundred-and-six count is exhausted, men and ghosts shall contend, the evil age shall be hard to endure. Teach one another, that all may turn to goodness. On the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth days, diligently perform purification rites, sweep and purify the altars—let nothing be lacking.\n\nOn the first day of the first month, I shall dispatch a million ghostly soldiers to drive out the wicked factions. Thirty thousand ghostly soldiers, each wielding a red staff, shall slay the evil upon the roads. Another fifty thousand ghostly soldiers, each bearing yellow medicine, shall inflict heart pains and epidemics, killing only those of wicked hearts. Seven thousand ghostly soldiers, each holding yellow medicine, shall spread plague—those afflicted shall find their limbs withered, unable to stretch. Six thousand ghostly soldiers, each bearing green medicine, shall roam the world—those stricken shall choke, their mouths sealed, unable to speak, until their lives end. Ten thousand ghostly soldiers, each holding white medicine, shall wander the world—those who contract this sickness shall suffer dizziness and deafness, dying upside-down. Twenty thousand ghostly soldiers, each bearing black medicine, shall roam the world—those afflicted shall burn with fever, rave in madness, and die without sleep. Five thousand ghostly soldiers, each holding red powder, shall traverse the world—those who fall ill shall die suddenly, unable to speak.\n\nA million child-spirits, each wielding thunder chariots and lightning bolts, shall I dispatch every third day of the third month to slay the unrighteous. Do you, the people of the world, know how many I command to be killed in a single day? When the hundred disasters converge and deceptions arise, if you wish to survive these calamities, then before the incense and lamps, do not trust those who deceive. I send forth thirty-six disciples to roam the Nine Provinces and Five Marchmounts, teaching and transforming all people. I bestow upon them the Dao’s *qi*—my disciples’ heads shall bear a sign: not yellow but red, not green but white. If you see their light, revere my gate with a single heart.\n\nAfter Great Peace, a non-acting emperor shall govern the realm. Then shall there be thirty-six thousand who become immortals.\n\nMoreover, there shall be one thousand white youths, who shall erect fifty-eight thousand banners, each banner three feet in length, its head adorned with a coiling dragon. These shall command fifty-eight thousand stalwart men, each bearing such a banner. They shall also lead one thousand one hundred female officials, each holding an incense burner, and all shall proceed in three ranks clad in yellow robes. At such a time, joy shall be unceasing, the world overflowing with abundance, and the sagely transformation so vast that the myriad people shall harbor no grievance.\n\nI inaugurate the beginning of Great Peace, first arising upon Mount Meng; thereafter, governance shall return to simplicity. How could you know the reason for this? My great cycle is fixed, my great covenant abides. Each of you must apply your heart and never grow remiss.\n\nI charge you, Daoist priests and nuns who follow the Dao’s stream: do not adhere to ordinary intentions. Each year, I thrice traverse the world to observe your cultivation. How could you know this? Sometimes I appear as a wandering scholar, sometimes as an urgent imperial messenger, sometimes as a destitute old man, sometimes as a forlorn orphan. Who can discern the true from the false?\n\nI customarily tread upon your altars on the first day of the first month, drifting north and south, or east and west. How could you fathom which altars I do not ascend, which chambers I do not enter? Within the fasting altars, I dwell in every place.\n\nI take pity on you, fearing you may not attain the highest good. Thus, I traverse the world, passing through every place, lest you abandon the true for the false, lead the multitude into wrongdoing. When Great Peace is revealed, yellow-robed followers shall appear in succession. The good shall receive fortune, the wicked shall wither of themselves. Punishment shall extend to the three clans—whom then shall you blame?\n\nI reside upon the Nine Heavens, at times riding cloud-cranes, driving crimson dragons, bearing extraordinary scriptures. The grotto-heavens of the Five Marchmounts and the renowned mountains under heaven—sometimes I wander among the common folk, concealed within the dust, refining conduct and cultivating essence. How could the foolish or wise know me? Sometimes I appear as an infant child, sometimes as a white-haired elder. By day I conceal myself, by night I roam, yet the hearts of the myriad people do not follow.\n\nBefore Great Peace is fully revealed, the sea’s treasury shall open the great flood. Xiangzhou shall shake with the sound of bronze drums, and the world shall tremble with dread. The impoverished shall lead the Daoists to restore my original palace. Lotus blossoms shall canopy the nine chambers, white deer shall graze upon the verdant pines. Phoenixes shall perch upon their sunny slopes, and qilin shall come to pay homage. Banners and flowers shall gleam like the sun and moon—who among those who see them would not follow?\n\nIf you wish to behold my form, devote your heart to emptiness. I dwell upon the Nine Heavens, briefly wandering the Five Marchmounts. When the multitude of worthies gathers to discourse, the ford of Meng shall be leveled, and the ditches of Lu made smooth. Blood shall flow to form rivers, and white bones shall pile into hills. The regions of Qing and Qi shall rise in great floods, while Ji and Ding shall become torrents. Between Dunhuang and the Baohan, the myriad people shall drift and float.\n\nOf old, there were ten great trials, through which my body was tempered a hundredfold. Reflecting thus, why should I bear grudges from former days? The sea’s treasury shall open the great wilderness, and in one stroke, the Nine Provinces shall be pacified. The Eastern Sea shall become mulberry fields, and Yuzhou shall rise with green towers. Those who witness Great Peace shall rejoice without sorrow.\n\nThe eternal mountains—Hua, Heng, and Song—I first traversed long ago. If you wish to know the vast and boundless, seek only among the fords and ditches. Jade maidens weave by the river, standing at their looms to craft brocade. If you do not believe this, go and ask Zhang Qian. Trust also in Dongfang Shuo, whose heart and intent are ever proclaimed.\n\nHeaven and Earth shall unite in harmony, and gatherings shall form karmic bonds. Ghostly soldiers, numberless as the infinite, shall carry stones to fill Kunlun. What mountain could rise higher than this? I alone shall stand with Heaven. Linked and joined, I shall cleave the Great Void, erecting altars of gold and silver. White jade shall guard the four corners, and immortal palaces and temples shall line the way.\n\nThe August Elder shall ascend the altar, and the good shall return to Chang’an. At that time, the Most High expounded this scripture and incantation, causing all sentient beings to turn their hearts toward goodness.\n\nHere ends Scroll Thirteen of the *Most High’s Scripture of the Wondrous Spells of the Abyssal Grotto*.\nHere begins Scroll Fourteen of the *Most High’s Scripture of the Wondrous Spells of the Abyssal Grotto*.\n\n**Chapter on the Hymn of the Ghost-Slaying Steps**\n\nThe Dao spoke, saying to the Perfected One of Luminous Net: \"From this day forward, if any person of good heart suffers misfortune or plague, they should invite a Daoist of the Three Caverns to recite the scriptures on their behalf. They must abstain from meat and pungent foods, forsake carnal desires, purify body and mind, and focus their thoughts in silent recitation, allowing no stray thoughts. They must constantly visualize the Five August Emperors, the spirit officials, the generals and attendants, and the guards on either side. The sponsor of the fast must devote themselves wholeheartedly, prostrating with reverence. The Dharma Master must summon the Perfected Immortals and Heavenly Worthies to descend and deliver the people from their afflictions. If their hearts are not sincere, their offerings of silk and treasure will be wasted, and the immortals and sages will not protect them. But if they follow my decree, they shall forever remain free from harm.\n\n\"Upon reciting this precious scripture once, the Heavenly Soldiers shall descend, and the Demon Kings shall be bound. If they do not heed my words, the Demon King Wulinzi shall have his head shattered into three hundred pieces.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Luminous Net entreated the Five Emperors and the divine immortals with their armies to descend into the ritual arena and search out and capture the demonic thieves.\n\nThe Azure Emperor of the East, Lord of the Nine Yi, with the Azure Spirit General and his host of eighty-one times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the eastern realm, all descended together to seize the azure plague spirits of wood in the east.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor of the South, Lord of the Eight Man, with the Vermilion Spirit General and his host of sixty-four times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the southern realm, all descended together to seize the vermilion plague spirits of fire in the south.\n\nThe White Emperor of the West, Lord of the Six Rong, with the White Spirit General and his host of thirty-six times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the western realm, all descended together to seize the white plague spirits of metal in the west.\n\nThe Black Emperor of the North, Lord of the Five Di, with the Black Spirit General and his host of twenty-five times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the northern realm, all descended together to seize the black plague spirits of water in the north.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor of the Center, Lord of the Three Qin, with the Yellow Spirit General and his host of nine times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the central realm, all descended together to seize the yellow plague spirits of earth in the center.\n\nAll shall be swept away and utterly destroyed, so that the afflicted may recover from their illnesses and the people enjoy peace and health.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High, let the Five Directions’ divine generals slay the ghosts and pacify the people. Such is the law.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The common folk and officials, the gate wardens and household guardians, the left and right pavilion chiefs, all the high and low ministers and grandees, the thirty myriad spirits within the home, the Three Generals who guard the dwelling, and the Broad Han upon the roof—let the master of the household, together with all its members, be freed from all misfortune: the nightmares and disorienting dreams, the frequent apparitions of malevolent spirits, which have persisted for so long without respite.\n\n\"Moreover, it is feared that the ancestors of the household—those who have passed before or after, the seven generations of forebears and the nine lineages of descendants—may have encountered inauspicious days or ill-fated hours, transgressed against Heaven and Earth, or offended the Three Luminaries, the great deities of the ten directions, and the Perfected Sages of the eight extremities. Thus, the household suffers from illnesses great and small, calamities arising in due season, curses and schemes, locusts and drought, epidemics among the six livestock. Therefore, the scriptures are recited, memorials presented, and offerings made to dissolve disasters and resolve all matters.\n\n\"From thirty-six generations past, the demonic thieves of the mountain forests and earth altars, the malevolent spirits of household shrines and temples, the thousand ghosts and ten thousand specters, the inner and outer kin of the family—all shall receive the merit of the scriptures, their calamities dissolved and resolved. From this day forward, after the recitation of the scriptures, they shall receive ten thousandfold blessings. Their wishes shall be fulfilled, their careers advanced, their desires granted. The sick shall recover, dreams shall be auspicious, legal entanglements resolved, plagues and banditry shall not arise, ghostly *qi* shall vanish, and evil spirits shall be extinguished.\n\n\"If you, demon kings, do not follow my teachings, your heads shall be shattered into one hundred and twenty pieces.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"From this day forth, as the Three Caverns spread their transformative influence, if any Daoist can establish a fast and recite the scriptures for the afflicted, present memorials, and perform offerings, wherever the Dharma Master conducts the ritual, evil ghosts shall hear of it and flee of their own accord. Young and old alike must devote themselves sincerely, prostrating toward the north to listen to the Dharma Master’s chanting of the hymns. When demonic spirits hear it, they shall naturally retreat far away, driven off for ten thousand leagues, never daring to return.\n\n\"Children, be earnest and reverent, and listen with respect:\n\nThe Azure Emperor of the East,\nGoumang, how vast and green!\nPeople grow like a hundred grasses,\nFragrant by nature as the seasons turn.\nThe good ascend to Heaven,\nThe wicked fall into boiling cauldrons.\nLike seeks like by its *qi*,\nUnlike cannot long endure.\nOutward discord brings no harmony,\nBut accord is like the mandarin ducks.\nDisdain leads one far from the Dao,\nReverence ascends to Heaven’s halls.\nHonor the master as sun and moon,\nFilial piety moves the ten directions.\nThose who disbelieve the Three Caverns’ law\nShall tread blades of frost for ten thousand kalpas.\nSeven generations sink into the Nine Darks,\nEndless night stretches on.\nAlas for the foolish mortal—\nDeath brings calamity to descendants.\nThose who slander the Dao of immortals and sages\nShall suffer hardship for ages unending.\nDo not believe? Then know this:\nThe unrighteous find no peace.\nPractice goodness, ascend to Heaven’s halls,\nReceive the registers, join the ranks of immortals,\nAnd behold the August Most High.\nChronic illness breeds evil ghosts—\nInvoke the sacred hymns.\nSeven generations of ancestors shall be freed,\nGazing upon the light of sun and moon.\nEstablish fasts, aid the poor,\nDrink the jade pool’s nectar.\nHeavenly spirits all descend,\nCommanding every king:\nEach must restrain their ghosts,\nLest they act with reckless force.\nSeize the venomous, capture the myriad ghosts,\nCrush the wicked and conceal them.\nToday, slay the evil ghosts,\nSubmit to the Azure Vastness.\nPlagues flee ten thousand leagues,\nGhosts depart, people thrive.\nRebellion and compliance each take their place,\nBlessings bring eternal prosperity.\nDivine soldiers heal the sick,\nDisciples pay homage to the East.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor of the South,\nYandi, how deep and distant!\nThe jade consorts of the Three Heavens,\nPerfected immortals descend to wander.\nHeaven and Earth endure long,\nHuman life is brief as morning dew.\nThe mysterious transforms the bright world,\nYet fools do not cultivate.\nThe deluded do not know the Dao,\nAnd the Dao cannot save them.\"\n\nThe wise scorn glory and wealth,\nThe foolish crave riches untold.\nThe wise ever tremble in fear,\nThe foolish know not sorrow’s hold.\nWhen waters rise nine myriad leagues,\nPestilence and ghostly hosts flow.\nIf the Dao’s assembly is spurned in the heart,\nOne departs for ten thousand kalpas—no return.\n\nIllness

source of their sins.\n\n**The Hymn of the Ten Heavenly Perfected:**\nI see all the foolish,\nWhose hearts know not their own selves.\nIn poverty, they commit the ten evils,\nSeeing goodness as if unheard.\nCoveting petty wealth,\nThey incur great transgressions.\nThe source of sins accumulates day and night,\nWith guilt piled high—what repentance can be spoken?\nThus they suffer myriad

Five Emperors summon demon kings,\nBinding evil and restraining ghostly bones.\nShould any dare to test this,\nHeavenly soldiers will slay their ghostly forms.\nJade maidens chant to the ten directions,\nGhosts die, and people live anew.\nAll gods hear the wondrous Dharma,\nSeven ancestors ascend to the heavenly court.\nAll attain liberation,\nTogether roaming the Purple Phoenix City.\n\nThose who uphold the Dao and meet the immortals,\nKeep their hearts upright.\nContemplating goodness, they ride dragons in flight,\nWhile the faithless fall into darkest night.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, they dwell in gloom,\nGone forever, never to be reborn.\nIf you revere the passage through the three calamities,\nReceive the wondrous scriptures from your master.\nThe Great Dao is most profound,\nRevere your master as the sun and moon,\nFilial piety moves the heavenly spirits.\nThose who disbelieve the Three Caverns’ scriptures,\nFor ten thousand kalpas tread upon blades and frost.\nSeven ancestors enter the dark realm,\nEndless night, how vast and boundless!\nAlas, the pain is unbearable—\nBody perishes, descendants die.\nSpeak no slander, and mouths remain blameless;\nSteal nothing, and ascend to heaven’s halls.\nServe your master to join the ranks of immortals,\nBeholding the Most High Lord.\nDisciples bow thrice,\nEverlasting fortune and prosperity.\n\nThe Dao declares: In all fasts, rituals, and scripture recitations, in setting up altars, chanting incantations, presenting memorials, burning incense, and visualizing spirits, meditate upon the perfected—\nSupplicating the Most High.\nThe mysterious, profound, and abyssal,\nThe samadhi divine incantations,\nThe treasure trove of great scriptures,\nThe numinous texts of the Upper Prime,\nThe Void and Empty Cavern,\nThe Three Heavens’ Perfected,\nThe Exalted Jade Emperor,\nThe Perfected of the Mysterious Center,\nThe Boundless Great Dao,\nThe responsive and perceptive of the ten directions—\nThe Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Emperor,\nThe Lord of Life who commands the myriad Daoist saints,\nThe twenty-four venerable worthies,\nThe divine soldiers of heaven and earth,\nThe thirty-six perfected,\nThe immortals of the Five Emperors,\nThose already perfected and those yet to be,\nAll lords of the mysterious and profound,\nEvery heavenly being—\nUniversally descend,\nWitnessing and affirming our sincere devotion.\nWith united hearts and combined strength,\nEncircle the homes of the fast’s patrons,\nA thousand times, a hundredfold,\nBows drawn, arrows nocked,\nGuarding and securing the four directions.\nFor every *zhang*, a general;\nFor every *chi*, a soldier.\nSearch within a hundred *li* of the patrons’ dwellings,\nIn every inch and span,\nSeizing the five pestilential plagues and malevolent ghosts,\nSlaying them upon capture.\nPity and pardon the disciples’ households,\nEnsuring peace in all four seasons,\nDissolving ten thousand misfortunes like melting ice.\nOfficial disputes and slanderous tongues shall never trouble them,\nNo floods or droughts shall arise,\nLivestock shall flourish,\nGraves and homes shall prosper,\nFamilies shall thrive in health.\nAll intentions and endeavors,\nShall meet with success.\nGhosts and demons shall flee afar,\nEvil spirits shall hide in flight.\nShould any ghost or malefactor refuse to depart,\nWe dispatch the thirty-six heavenly immortals and divine soldiers,\nTo descend, seize, and bind them,\nSlaying them one by one,\nAllowing none to escape.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Most High’s oral decree commands.\n\nFurther, in accordance with the *Nüqing Veritable Writ* and the statutes of the divine ordinances:\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, in all lands under heaven, should any suffer from plagues year after year, it is the demon kings—Wumingjiu and their legions—who bring calamities, roaming the world to afflict the people, accompanying the wandering souls of seven generations of ancestors to spread pestilence and slaughter the populace. If any of virtuous heart, moved to preserve and protect, invite masters of the Three Caverns to establish ritual altars, recite scriptures, chant incantations, present memorials according to the Dharma, and hold fasts and offerings, praying to the Five Emperors and the immortals, their merit shall be boundless. They shall dispel plagues and bestow blessings, their merit unmatched. The wandering souls of seven generations shall ascend to the azure heavens, the nine lineages of ancestors shall be liberated in the Vermilion Mound. They shall transcend the three realms, attaining freedom in the six voids. The people shall enjoy peace and prosperity, the old and young shall live in tranquility. Their lifespans shall be extended, and they shall attain immortality and transcend the world. Fields shall yield double harvests, silkworms shall spin eightfold threads. Graves and homes shall be harmonious, livestock shall multiply. Public and private affairs shall be serene, disasters and pestilence shall vanish. The lord and king of the realm shall surpass Yao and Shun in virtue. The golden branches shall flourish, the jade leaves shall remain evergreen. The world shall know great peace, weapons shall be stilled. Governors and magistrates shall rule with the Dao, bringing peace to the people. No calamities shall arise, no rebellions shall occur. The four serpents shall withdraw their venom, the six thieves shall cease their depredations. We now transmit this scripture to dissolve your disasters and avert your sufferings—why not receive it with reverence? Those who receive it devoutly shall gain boundless blessings. But those who deceive their masters, betray the Dao, disobey the scriptures’ words, commit the five rebellious acts, are unfilial, kill the innocent, exploit the orphaned and poor, or harm the good and virtuous—such sins shall pile high as mountains and seas. Whether in past lives or present, for men and women, old and young, high and low, from the age of seven onward, none shall escape these grievous sins.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense to make universal repentance, beseeching that all sins be swept away and no punishments be meted out. From this moment after the turning of the scriptures, you ghostly multitudes, together with the demon kings and their legions, and all spirits and specters, shall follow the directives of this true scripture. Should any fierce or overbearing ghostly brigands defy our edict, the Ten Heavenly Divine Generals shall be dispatched to cut them down at once, leaving no descendants.\n\n*Recite urgently as per the* **Taishang’s Oral Command to Slay Ghosts and Pacify the People.**\n\n**The Fourteenth Scroll of the** *Taishang Dongyuan Divine Incantations Sutra* **concludes.**\n\n**The Fifteenth Scroll of the** *Taishang Dongyuan Divine Incantations Sutra*\n**The Step of Lu: The Release from Torment**\n\nThe Dao speaks: We cannot bear to witness you, the people of the world, so shallow in fortune and virtue. From the moment you emerged from the womb into this world, from the age of seven when you learned to speak, every gesture, every word, every thought has been tainted by the five poisons, while the six thieves vie for dominance. Never have you shown kindness; only evil arises, and you delight in killing. Thus, the Three Corpses record your deeds, and the Seven Ghosts inscribe your names. On every *jiazi* and *gengshen* day, they report to the Heavenly Courts, where your sins accumulate to three thousand. The celestial ledgers issue decrees to the Central Dipper’s bureau, commanding the star officials of your fate to seize your three hun and seven po souls and consign them to the Earth Prison of Mount Tai. From there, your case falls into the Register of Life and Death, and your grave offenses are transferred to Fengdu, plunging you into the Twenty-Four Hells. Even if your sins are not compounded, you shall remain in the Eighteen Hells of Mount Tai, lashed day and night, tormented without cease. Once your confessions are fixed and your records made clear, the hell wardens raise their forks, and the clerks drag you forward. The Great King Yama rages, for your crimes admit no pardon. Each is measured by its statute, and you must repay your karmic debts. Some shall be reborn in the heavenly realms, some in the earthly, some among humans, some as ghosts, some as beasts. Some shall live, some fall ill; some shall die, some linger in death’s threshold. Some shall be sated to death, some starved; some scorched, some frozen; some drowned, some burned; some crushed by earth, maimed by wood, or slain by metal blades. Some shall perish from snakebites, tiger maulings, or the jaws of dragons and turtles; some from the goring of oxen, the trampling of horses, or the bites of dogs. Some shall die by blades, cudgels, or warfare; some by lightning, hail, or tempest. Some, though not yet dead, shall suffer every manner of foul disease: the five-colored swellings of *qi*, emaciation, madness, epilepsy, scabies, leprosy, ulcers, sores, scars, consumption, malaria, blindness, deafness, muteness, stuttering, throat closures, nasal obstructions, vertigo, hunchbacks, protruding chests, twisted limbs, swollen bellies, heart pain, vomiting, and retching. These myriad afflictions, too numerous to name, are the retribution for your past sins, which you have failed to recognize.\n\nWe, now entrusted with the salvation of the people, cannot bear to see you endure such suffering and perpetual calamity. Thus, we specially dispatch the Radiant Net Realized One to carry this scripture through the world, delivering all beings from the five sufferings, dissolving disasters, averting misfortunes, rescuing the imperiled, healing the sick, and eradicating the roots of all woes. Should any among the people—whether commoners or officials—suffer from these afflictions, or be entangled in lawsuits and imprisoned for years, or face droughts, floods, locusts, warfare, or epidemics that no physician can cure, let them invite a high-ranking master of the Three Caverns to purify and establish a sacred altar. Let them turn the scriptures, recite the incantations, submit memorials, set up fasts, and perform rites to thank the Five Emperors. Let the immortals pace the void, chanting praises and circling the altar. By the spontaneous power of the Most High, the assembly of the Venerable One shall gather. The merit of the heavenly soldiers is boundless; all sins shall disperse, demonic legions perish, epidemics vanish, households prosper, families thrive, states and courts know peace, droughts and floods cease, fields and silkworms yield double, and livestock flourish. We now chant for you to gather poisons and withdraw pestilence—listen with reverence.\n\nThe Daoist assembly intones:\n**The Venerable Lord of the Eastern Azure,** named the Numinous Goumang,\nThe

follow.\nFlying immortals roam the Three Realms;\nPerfected Ones chant amidst the clouds.\nSaints utter no sound,\nWho can know this heart?\nThe True and Upright Great Unity transforms,\nWithout sign,

thousand years like a single spring.\nCountless ages are but an evening,\nHow could worldly names suffice for discussion?\nIf one possesses the bones of immortals,\nOnly then does this heart respond.\n\nThe Three Caverns flow to the ten directions,\nThe Luminous Teachings must be propagated by men.\nLoyalty and faith uphold the scriptures and precepts,\nJust as the Five Peaks are sacred.\nWithout the bones to soar aloft,\nHow could one ascend and fly?\nFix the heart beyond the Three Realms,\nLet thoughts drift to the Jade Capital.\nPerfected Ones chant in the void,\nJade maidens glide through the emptiness.\nToday, we pay homage to the Heavenly Venerable,\nBowing our heads to the Jade Emperor.\n\n---\n\nAt the time of purification, three hymns:\nThe Most High is profoundly mysterious,\nThe supreme principle leaves no trace.\nWondrous enlightenment is sung in the void,\nImmortals chant amidst the emptiness.\nIf not a scholar of the Yellow Forest,\nWho could propagate this merit?\nAscending through the clouds in reverence,\nThe distant heavenly beings appear.\nMouths recite the true secret formulas,\nEight dragons ascend to the Purple Court.\nIf not a guest of the highest realms,\nHow could one embody this scripture?\nThe supreme principle transcends distant shores,\nWhere there is existence, there is no unraveling.\nThe Mystic Artisan illumines the Three Luminaries,\nPerfected Ones receive the model and standard.\nImmortals bow to the flowing cinnabar,\nNone fail to prostrate in reverence.\n\n---\n\nEstablishing the Great Purification Rite for three nights:\nWondrous are the Three Cavern Scriptures,\nDivinely guarded, welcomed by nine dragons.\nEstablishing the rite dispels anxious hearts,\nAllowing one to wander the Purple Phoenix City.\nMeritorious resolve accumulates over ten thousand kalpas,\nHow dare demons disobey?\nClear and resonant, the eight tones resound,\nThe capital of the Most High in the ten directions.\nThe Three Caverns are best studied with wholehearted devotion,\nTo guide and transform, delivering sentient beings.\nWhen the scripture is expounded,\nThree bows are made while listening to the teachings.\nBeyond the distant Three Realms,\nVast and boundless, profoundly obscure.\nNow we establish the great purification rite,\nLighting lamps to illuminate the mysterious stars.\nSuddenly, a young phoenix exhales,\nSummoning the divine to muster demonic troops.\n\nThe Dao speaks: \"I reside above the Three Heavens,\nUnable to bear seeing the multitudes of your world bring calamity upon themselves.\nSickness, death, and ruin are rampant,\nAll of your own making.\nFrom the age of seven,\nThe six thieves and ten evils arise in competition.\nBody and mind are constantly recorded by the Three Corpses for their transgressions,\nReported to the celestial bureaus to determine the length of your lives,\nBefore they are ordered to pursue and seize you.\nThus, the celestial bureaus issue decrees,\nAnd demon kings spread plagues and diseases.\nAll because of the sins committed by your body, heart, mouth, and hands.\nNow, for the sake of you and all beings,\nI broadly proclaim repentance.\nLet each demon king and ghostly lord\nHear these scriptural words,\nNaturally generating shame and remorse,\nWithdrawing their poisons and diseases.\n\nYou, the people of this world,\nListen with a tranquil heart\nAs I recount the origins of your sins.\"\n\nThe Dao speaks: \"Now I tell you, sentient beings,\nFrom the age of seven,\nYou have incurred the retribution of scolding wind and cursing rain.\nYou have incurred the retribution of disrespecting Heaven and Earth.\nOr disrespecting the sun, moon, and stars.\nOr cursing and reviling the gods of Heaven and Earth.\nOr exposing your form to the Three Luminaries.\nOr resenting and cursing ghosts and spirits.\nOr invoking and summoning taboo names of underworld deities.\nOr failing to revere the precepts, defiling and disdaining the wondrous.\nOr disrespecting parents and teachers.\nOr facing the Three Luminaries to urinate or defecate.\nOr disrespecting scriptures and teachings, leaking secret texts.\nOr slandering the loyal, good, and wise.\nOr using youth to bully elders, lacking harmony and obedience.\nOr using light scales and small measures when giving to others.\nOr using heavy scales and large measures when taking for oneself.\nOr abandoning the Dao to embrace heterodoxy.\nOr acting unlawfully.\nOr encouraging others to do evil, forsaking their good roots.\nOr disrespecting the teachings, sabotaging others’ success.\nOr persistently acting with malice, concealing good and promoting evil.\nOr acting as a false master, lacking spiritual efficacy, deceitfully speaking as a god, ruining others’ hearts and affairs.\nOr violating graves and disturbing tombs, startling the spirits.\nOr offending household gods, defiling wells and hearths.\nOr casting filth into water and fire.\nOr defiling and disdaining the earth and soil.\nOr polluting gold, silver, copper, and iron.\nOr borrowing without repayment, speaking falsely with the heart.\nOr mocking others for doing good, desiring them to do evil.\nOr resenting others’ good deeds, delighting in unlawfulness.\nOr seeing others cultivate merit and establish virtue, begrudging and refusing to bestow.\nOr praying for blessings and making vows without reverence.\nOr buying and selling Daoist and Buddhist scriptures, images, and sacred objects.\nOr cursing the innocent, implicating ordinary people.\nOr bullying and scheming to seize others’ property.\nOr drinking wine and eating meat, pretending drunkenness to invoke gods and ghosts.\nOr indulging in lust and desire, disregarding kinship.\nOr conducting purification rites and offering rituals without following the proper procedures.\nOr failing to rescue in times of urgency, refusing to assist in danger, desiring others’ downfall.\nOr making vows to cultivate and construct merit, yet failing to complete them.\nOr receiving treatment from masters when ill, yet not understanding the texts and petitions.\nOr relying on alcohol to act wildly, offending elders and superiors, destroying everything.\nOr seeing others’ wives and women, harboring lustful thoughts.\nOr keeping purification vows yet breaking precepts, arrogantly disdaining the immortals.\nOr killing living beings, trampling insects and ants.\nOr being greedy, never knowing contentment.\nOr giving free rein to jealousy, beating and scolding subordinates, refusing to provide clothing.\nOr maliciously altering contracts, seizing others’ fields.\nOr when drunk, or in times of urgency, making solemn vows, then breaking them with deceitful hearts.\"\n\nOr harboring scheming intentions, all manner of wicked and malevolent offenses.\nOr enjoying abundant clothing and food, with all desires fulfilled, yet failing to feel shame for heaven’s gifts.\nSuch offenses are too numerous to recount in full.\nNow, in the midst of this recitation, confessing past transgressions and making vows, may all sins be swept away and mercy granted at once.\nMay sins sink into the nine depths of earth, and blessings arise from the ten directions.\nIn life after life, may one always encounter the Great Dao, faithfully receive and uphold it.\n\n*The Fifteenth Scroll of the Supreme Cavernous Divine Incantations Sutra* concludes.\n\n*The Sixteenth Scroll of the Supreme Cavernous Divine Incantations Sutra*\n*The Chapter on Commanding Ghosts*\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the ten directions of the world, among the common people—men and women—if afflicted by ghosts and spirits, falling ill or dying;\nOr suffering from madness, running wildly, speaking alone in delirium;\nOr struck by cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, with unceasing muscle spasms;\nOr plagued by epidemic fevers, jaundice, toxic heat diseases, swelling, and distension;\nOr harmed by fire, water, bandits, or theft, losing wealth and livestock, facing slander and lawsuits, unjust imprisonment, attacks by birds and beasts, chickens and dogs, bloodshed and strange omens, miscarriages, deaths of men and women, unfulfilled vows, all manner of misfortune, restless graves and homes, and depletion of livelihood—\nFor all such afflictions and hardships, the impoverished and unlucky should seek a wise master, receive my precepts and registers, revere and honor them, and refrain from all evil.\nOn days of calamity, bathe, don proper attire, burn incense, pay homage to the sutras, sit upright with a calm mind, compose the spirit and quiet the thoughts, hold incense, and knock the teeth thirty-six times.\nRecite the incantation:\n*Crowned with the Vermilion Sparrow, treading the Dark Warrior beneath the feet,\nSupported by the Azure Dragon on the left, seated upon the White Tiger on the right,\nWith the Verdant Essence Sword and halberds before me, and the Golden Hammer and Iron Axe behind,\nHeavenly Ding warriors guard my front and rear.\nA hundred Yellow Slaves—all malevolent ghosts and thieves—flee a thousand miles away.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the world, there are countless ghosts that harm the people; I now know all your names.\nThe Red-Headed Ghost King of Slaughter, standing two *zhang* tall, commands thirty-six trillion slaughter ghosts, each wielding a red staff, roaming the world to claim lives.\nThere are also the Three Heavenly Great Demons, the Nine Heavenly Great Demons, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Great Demons, the Ten Directions’ Slaughter Ghosts, the Ghost-Commanding Great Kings, and thirty-eight myriad beings.\nFurther, the Eastern Divine Spirit, the Western Divine Spirit, the Southern Divine Spirit, and the Northern Divine Spirit, each leading three hundred million attendants, afflict men and women, depleting their resources.\nI know all your names—flee a thousand miles away!\nIf you do not depart, I will dispatch the Eight Divisions of Enforcing Soldiers to strike you down.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\nThe Dao speaks: Great Demon Kings Xia Yin, Wu Yan Chi, Bo Hong Gong, and others, along with the Thirty-Nine Myriad Great Expulsion Generals, twelve myriad great soldiers, four hundred thousand Red Bow Great Troops, nineteen thousand Regional Strongmen, forty-nine myriad Life-Commanding Officers, and eight hundred ten thousand Heavenly Slaughter Marquis Great Soldiers—\nAll shall heed my command, gather the thousand spirits and myriad demons for all good men and women, drive them beyond the borders, and spare the innocent.\nI further summon the thirty-six Heavenly Great Kings with seven myriad soldiers, the ninety myriad great soldiers of the Nine Heavens, eighty myriad Heavenly Spirits who never depart, thirty myriad Heavenly Ding warriors, four hundred thousand Incense-Transmitting Jade Maidens, four hundred thousand Incense-Attending Golden Chapters, thirty-six Brahma Kings, and nine thousand myriad Righteous Soldiers.\nUpon hearing this sutra, you must come to protect the person [named], causing ghosts and demons to retreat and all illnesses to be cured.\nI further summon four hundred thousand Harmonious Might Warriors, thirty-six myriad Hundred-Tongued Official Soldiers, and others.\nWherever this sutra is recited and incantations are proclaimed, you must reconcile the person’s family and relatives, ensuring internal and external harmony, peace for kin, and stability for the household.\nGuard the person, expel all external ghosts and demonic spirits, and drive them away.\nThose who protect diligently shall be rewarded according to the statutes; those who defy me shall incur the punishment of the Three Officials.\nBeware, beware!\nKnock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times.\n\nThe Dao speaks: If devout men and women, rulers, officials, commoners, monks, minor immortals, officials of all ranks, mountain sages, courageous scholars, the noble and the lowly—upon hearing this sutra—can believe and accept it,\nKnow that such a person has, for countless kalpas, been an immortal, born from the heavens.\nThough briefly in the world, they will soon ascend as immortals.\nSome may achieve liberation through simulated death, or feign extinction, ascending to the heavens never to die again.\nFor this reason, I briefly expound this sutra.\nYet many in the world do not believe in the Dao; people’s hearts are wicked. Upon hearing this sutra, they scorn it, mock the divine incantations, disbelieve the sacred words, dismiss it as sorcery, disrespect the true sutra, deceive their masters, and belittle the Dao, refusing to believe.\nSuch people come from the Three Evil Realms, harboring malice and venom, their dark sins unresolved, their karmic obstacles heavy—this is why they are so.\nIn this life, they suffer afflictions: greed, ignorance, and delusion bind them like silkworms in a cocoon, with no hope of escape.\nOr they contract severe illnesses, their bodies ravaged by jaundice and epidemics, haunted by plague ghosts that never leave their side, their livelihoods failing, their endeavors thwarted. Even if they attain high office, they soon fall from grace.\nOr they face mutilation, swiftly reduced to lowly status; temporary wealth and nobility give way to poverty. If struck by grave illness, their families perish without cause.\nOr their bodies fester with malignant sores, leprosy, oozing pus and blood, or they suffer from scabies, syphilitic sores, edema, *qi* diseases, carbuncles, silkworm-like ulcers, and boils—plague diseases spread by ghosts, infecting neighbors.\nIf they seek shamans, their suffering worsens; even with good medicine, they cannot be cured. Their lives end, leaving lingering misfortune—this is the heavenly punishment for scorning this sutra.\n\nSuch persons shall again be cast into the Avīci Hell, confined within its dark prisons and barred cells, for kalpas uncounted without reprieve. Only after this shall they emerge, reborn as birds and beasts, the six kinds of livestock—despised and abhorred by humankind, their names unwelcome to the ear. They shall feed on filth and foulness, even mingled with excrement. Their desires shall never be sated; they shall bear heavy burdens in toil and suffering, lashed by whips and cudgels. Once they lose the human form, ten thousand kalpas shall pass before they regain it. Such is the retribution for mocking this sutra.\n\nNow I look upon the beings of the lower realms, and see their suffering and joy, their lifespans long or short, their stations noble or base, their deeds unequal. Thus do I pity all those tormented by suffering, as a mother pities her infant child. I exhort the foolish and ignorant to revere and believe, that all may be liberated and ascend to the heavens, spared the afflictions of the womb, ever possessing bodies pure and free. They shall wander with me, and I proclaim this verse:\n\n*The samādhi spreads far and wide;*\n*Those with karmic affinity may hear it.*\n*The wise at once believe and receive;*\n*For kalpas they shall be noble ones.*\n*Though briefly born in the world of men,*\n*Soon they shall ascend as immortals.*\n*To deliver all beings, I come to this cause.*\n\nI dispatch the devas and humans, the true immortals of countless kalpas, to teach and transform the benighted. Yet the wicked refuse to believe, and further mock this sutra, declaring its teachings devoid of spiritual efficacy. They show no reverence or love, and in this life they suffer retribution: afflicted by disease, plagued by pestilence ghosts and demon kings who come to destroy their households, their kin and wives and children all perish, their deaths still insufficient. Their souls descend into hell, where for ten thousand kalpas there is no release, cast into the darkness of *qi*. Imprisoned in heavy fetters, they endure torment most grievous. Through the long night of darkness, they emerge at last as birds and beasts, feeding on foulness, or reborn as livestock. Scorned by humankind, they bear heavy loads beneath the whip. Such is the punishment for those who slight this sutra.\n\nYet those who believe and receive it shall gain blessings and ascend to heaven. Those with the bones of immortals shall uphold the *Samādhi Sutra*. You who cultivate the Middle Way shall behold the True Lord.\n\nWhen the Most High had spoken this verse, the Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens, the thirty-six Heavenly Demon Kings, the celestial maidens, the devas, Brahmā kings, demon kings, and their retinues, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s hymn, rejoiced in their hearts. As one, they rose, prostrated themselves, and bowed twice, saying: “We, the Great Brahmā and Demon Kings, together with our followers, shall ever guard and protect, traversing the world. For those who uphold this sutra, we shall ensure freedom from disease, capturing and slaying the pestilence ghosts, malevolent spirits, and demonic plagues that bring calamity, that their illnesses may swiftly be cured. May all their wishes be fulfilled, their legal troubles resolved, their endeavors successful. If any evil demons, perverse spirits, or wicked ghosts disobey the Most High’s command, we shall seize and rend them into ten thousand pieces, grinding them to dust, and show no mercy. We, the Demon Kings, now swear together: we shall not commit evil, but pray to transform our demonic forms, ever walking the immortal path, drawing near to the Great Sage.”\n\nAt that time, the Perfected Ones—Weiming, Luotong, Zhishi, Zhang, and Junminzi—and the assembled devas, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s wondrous verse, rejoiced greatly. Each prostrated themselves thrice, believing, receiving, and vowing to practice it.\n\n*The Sixteenth Scroll of the* Most High Cavernous Divine Incantations Sutra *concludes.*\n*The Seventeenth Scroll of the* Most High Cavernous Divine Incantations Sutra *begins.*\n\n**Chapter on Summoning the Celestial Deities and Dragon Spirits to Pacify Tombs and Dwellings**\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord, prior to the Radiant Dawn of the Great Beginning, accompanied the assembly of celestial deities, immortals, and the ten supreme Divine Kings of the Great Sages. Together they proceeded to the ruins of Yang Valley beneath the Long Sang Grove, circumambulating thrice to the left in ritual procession. With one heart, they bowed in reverence and addressed the Primordial Heavenly Worthy:\n\n“Your servant observes that when the parents or kin of ordinary people pass away, they are interred upon the hills, tombs erected to secure their rest for ten thousand years, in hope of safeguarding descendants and ensuring prosperity for their children. Yet those who remain at home suffer misfortune year after year, enduring constant hardship, annual calamities, and the dissipation of wealth and grain. Misfortunes befall them without cause, entangling them in official lawsuits and imprisonment for years. Their livestock fails to multiply, their fields and silkworms lose vitality, their fortunes falter, and their plans go awry.\n\n“By virtue of past karma, they now enjoy blessings in this life and, on this day, have been granted the sight of the Most High and Supreme Worthy. I humbly beseech You to dispel my ignorance and grant Your compassionate mercy. Should You deign to instruct me, even the decayed bones of the departed shall be revived, and they shall receive Your boundless grace—a debt impossible to repay for the gift of life.”\n\nThereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy snapped His fingers and furrowed His brow, addressing the Most High Dao Lord:\n\n“What you have described regarding the causes of misfortune is indeed a profound means to relieve suffering. To deliver those sunk in delusion and guide them to the shore of fortune, you may now be seated.”\n\nWith utmost reverence, the Dao Lord gazed upon the sacred countenance, his heart earnest and intent, listening with unwavering focus and sincere devotion.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then asked the Most High Dao Lord:\n\n“Have you observed those who enjoy abundance and warmth, as well as those who suffer hunger and cold?”\n\nThe Dao Lord replied:\n\n“I have seen them often, yet I do not fully understand the root of their conditions. I humbly beseech Your sacred grace to bestow Your guidance.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\n\n“Those who receive such good fortune may owe it to the blessings they cultivated in past lives, now ripening in this one. Or they may inherit the residual virtue of their ancestors, which extends to their descendants. If, in addition to enjoying such abundance, they aid the poor and relieve the suffering, restore ancient sacred sites and immortal dwellings, and diligently build and maintain them, they shall reap blessings in this very life, not merely in the hereafter.\n\n“As for those who endure hunger, cold, and poverty, their suffering may stem from past lives in which they plundered and harmed the virtuous. Or they may have stolen materials meant for construction, failed to rescue those in peril, or refused to assist those in distress. Perhaps they exploited many laborers, hoarded grain in granaries, amassed wealth in their households, or relied upon their riches in silver and gold. They may have complained of their dwellings being too cramped or their halls too low, disregarding the dangers of harming life or the signs of declining fortune and severed destiny. Acting recklessly, they violated the Two Black Stars and Five Yellow Stars, inviting the doom of dwindling households and failed enterprises. Or, when burying their kin, they feared only the ominous cries of women and the killing of children, neglecting to choose auspicious years and months for the benefit of the deceased when constructing the tomb. Such actions invoke the Five Ghosts and Three Calamities of the dead, bringing misfortune upon the living and causing their households to suffer violence. They may associate with wicked companions, bully the weak, offend their elders, curse their fathers, or deceive their mothers, leading to injuries from wood and stone, harm from snakes and tigers, or death by lightning, fire, plague, warfare, or imprisonment. Year after year, they face lawsuits, lose wealth without cause, fail in their endeavors, and struggle to achieve their goals. Their fields and silkworms languish, their households fall into discord, their livestock fails to thrive, and they wander in perpetual hardship, year after year of misfortune, with no path to peace.\n\n“Those of high practice who comprehend the scriptures, along with the Daoist priests, shall follow the natural codes of the *Numinous Treasure*. They may conduct rites day and night, offering incense, ascending the altar, and submitting petitions. Thrice daily, they shall perform the ritual circumambulation and recite the scriptures, summoning the celestial deities, earthly spirits, dragon kings, and sacred assemblies to absolve past transgressions and future errors, repenting for former sins and seeking forgiveness for deep offenses. They shall pray for the descent of boundless grace to deliver them.\n\n“The altar shall stand two *zhang* and four *cun* in height, exceeding one *zhang* and two *chi* in width. It shall be adorned with twenty-four stalks of *zuan*, encircled thrice to the left by a cord. The Gate of Heaven and the Door of Earth shall be opened, along with the Human Gate and the Ghost Gate. Within the altar, arrange eleven incense altars or five incense tables for the directions. Adorn the ritual space with banners and canopies.\n\n“With utmost reverence, they shall invoke the Nameless and Natural Great Dao, the Jade Purity Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Highest Purity Jade Dawn Dao Lord, the Supreme Purity Mysterious Origin Venerable Lord, the Most High Great One of the Empty Cavern Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and the Five Elder Emperor Lords of the Great Beginning, the Three Primordial Venerable Saints, the Sovereigns of the Sun and Moon, the Five Planetary Sages, the Seven Primordial Perfected Lords, the Divine Perfected of the Five Celestial Granaries, and the officials of the Three Terraces.\n\n“With solemn respect, they shall state the purpose of their prayer, purifying body and mind. Then they shall unfurl the scriptures and recite the names and titles of the dragon spirits.\n\n“They shall invoke:\nThe Azure Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the East,\nThe Vermilion Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the South,\nThe White Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the West,\nThe Black Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the North,\nThe Yellow Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the Center.\n\nThe Dragon King of the Eastern Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Southern Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Western Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Northern Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Central Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of Auspicious Cultivation in the East,\nThe Dragon King of Abundant Goodness in the South,\nThe Dragon King of Sweet Thoughts in the West,\nThe Dragon King of Flowing Waves in the North,\nThe Dragon King of the Black Dragon in the Center.\n\nThe Celestial Deity Dragon King,\nThe Earthly Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Dragon King of the Nation,\nThe Dragon King of the Prefecture,\nThe Dragon King of the Deep Forest,\nThe Dragon King of Blossoming Flowers,\nThe Dragon King of Auspicious Joy,\nThe Dragon King of Thoughtful Celebration,\nThe Dragon King of Palaces,\nThe Dragon King of Halls,\nThe Dragon King of Houses,\nThe Dragon King of Chambers,\nThe Dragon King of Kitchens and Hearths,\nThe Dragon King of Estates and Fields,\nThe Dragon King of Silkworms and Mulberries,\nThe Dragon King of Silk and Cotton,\nThe Dragon King of Fine Silk,\nThe Dragon King of Brocade and Fine Fabrics—”\n\nThe Dragon King of Fine Silks and Gauzes,\nThe Dragon King of Gold and Silver,\nThe Dragon King of Pearls and Jade,\nThe Dragon King of Copper and Iron,\nThe Dragon King of Granaries and Storehouses,\nThe Dragon King of the Eight Grains,\nThe Dragon King of the Son of Heaven,\nThe Dragon King of the Feudal Lords,\nThe Dragon King of the Commandery Lords,\nThe Dragon King of the County Magistrates,\nThe Dragon King of the Household Heads,\nThe Dragon King of Descendants,\nThe Dragon King of Hills and Mountains,\nThe Dragon King of Tombs and Dwellings,\nThe Dragon King of Yin Abodes,\nThe Dragon King of Yang Abodes,\nThe Dragon King of National Protection,\nThe Dragon King of Prefecture Pacification,\nThe Dragon King of Household Safeguarding,\nThe Dragon King of Ghost-Driving,\nThe Dragon King of Ghost-Slaying,\nThe Dragon King of the Six Livestock,\nThe Dragon King of Wealth and Money,\nThe Dragon King of Wealth-Attraction,\nThe Dragon King of Clothing and Headgear,\nThe Dragon King of Benevolence and Righteousness,\nThe Dragon King of Loyalty and Filial Piety,\nThe Dragon King of Rain and Dew,\nThe Dragon King of Springs and Marshes.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy proclaimed that these myriad celestial dragon kings, each with ninety thousand hosts, if there be faithful and devout male and female disciples who, having endured years of misfortune in their households, invite accomplished and enlightened Daoist masters to establish a ritual arena at home—whether by arranging an altar and setting up a register, submitting memorials at the hours of *zi* and *wu*, or considering the scale of the people’s prayers—may resolve disasters and transcend calamities solely through the recitation of scriptures, submitting petitions at the three periods, or performing the Dao at the six hours. Upon the conclusion of the fast and the dispersal of the altar, a grand *jiao* offering to summon the dragons should be held, ensuring the protection and stability of the household, the nation, the king, and the common folk. All shall attain peace, free from disasters, with misfortunes dissolved, blessings and protection universally bestowed, bandits and thieves vanishing without trace, and the divine dragons shielding and dispelling calamities, swiftly banishing them a myriad miles beyond the borders. The people shall rejoice in their livelihoods, and a single planting shall yield ninefold harvests.\n\nBy the edict of the Most High, the myriad celestial dragon kings and the divine soldiers and warriors of the ten directions shall each receive their commands and descend to guard the nation, the prefectures, the ancestral tombs, and the households. At this time, the sovereigns, ministers, and officials of the nation and prefectures, along with the common people, shall wholeheartedly embrace the Dao, each vowing to receive the *Marvelous Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Divine Footsteps*, allowing the Dharma to spread and flourish. The celestial dragon deities, the great sage divine kings, the warriors, the perfected immortals, and the divine soldiers shall all come to safeguard them. The faithful male and female disciples who uphold the scriptural Dharma shall each be blessed with longevity, perpetually occupying positions of emolument. The lands shall enjoy eternal peace, the people shall thrive in prosperity, the eight grains shall ripen abundantly, and the world shall be at great peace. The Three Luminaries shall shine with true radiance, ever adhering to the proper measures of time; the Five Movements shall not err, and the Four Seasons shall follow their course. The Three Calamities shall be forever eradicated, and the scourge of war shall vanish without trace.\n\nHasten, hasten, in accordance with the Most High’s edict, as the divine dragon’s great decree to pacify the people!\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy further addressed the people of the Lower Realm: From this day forward, if there be any nation or prefecture in turmoil, its people in distress, the Three Calamities arising in competition, the Five Poisons spreading unchecked, bandits and thieves encroaching upon the people, villages and hamlets reduced to ashes, the people losing their livelihoods, prefectures and commanderies laid to waste, the populace starving and enslaved, kin and kindred estranged, and flesh and blood sundered—these are the works of demonic soldiers and rampant disasters, bringing bitter suffering to humanity. If there be a sovereign, prefectural lord, or regional governor who can lead the multitudes—whether ten households or five—uniting their hearts and strength to procure incense and oil, establish a ritual arena, and sincerely invite accomplished Daoist masters well-versed in the scriptures and precepts to recite the *Sacred Canon of Dragon-Summoning* and the *Northern Dipper’s Abyssal Secret Texts*, with unified devotion and purified intent, together venerating the true image of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the august forms of the Five Venerable Sovereigns, and the true visages of all the immortals and sages, presenting their supplications with utmost sincerity—then I shall dispatch the summoned hosts of sacred perfected dragon deities to descend upon the ritual arena, heeding the people’s wishes. They shall deploy their soldiers to capture and subdue the malevolent demons causing harm, extinguishing the Five Poisons and the Three Calamities. They shall bestow vast grace and great blessings, protecting and sheltering the devoted common folk, who shall forever receive the profound favor of the Dao, perpetually bathing in its compassion. Their plans shall unfold as desired, their endeavors shall succeed, their undertakings shall all come to fruition, their families shall flourish, and their gates shall prosper with noble lineages.\n\nAfter peace is restored, they shall devote themselves even more sincerely to revering the Three Luminaries and honoring all the numinous deities, naturally and eternally enjoying tranquility and prosperity.\n\nHasten, hasten, in accordance with the Most High’s edict to deliver the people from disaster and invoke blessings!\n\nThus concludes the seventeenth scroll of the *Most High Abyssal Divine Incantations Scripture*.\nThe eighteenth scroll of the *Most High Abyssal Divine Incantations Scripture*:\n**Determining the Fortunes and Misfortunes within the Six Jia Cycles and Invoking Blessings**\n\nThe Dao proclaimed: In the *Longhan* era of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, together with the Five Venerable Sovereigns, the Two Palaces of Yin and Yang, the Five Perfected Stars of the Upper Realms, the Seven Perfected Lords of the Primal Origins, and the officials of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, they roamed the Three Heavens, determining the fortunes and misfortunes of the mortal realm. Later, in the first year of the *Shanghuang* era, the year of *jiawu*, they descended upon the Central Lands of *Zhendan*, observing the various nations of this world. Blessings and auspices were rare, pestilence and miasmas raged fiercely, the people suffered widespread displacement, and the lands were afflicted by alternating floods and droughts, causing the Five Grains to fail in their ripening.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy sighed in lamentation, moved by the suffering of the multitudes. Thereupon, he manifested his divine power, revealing the might of the Dao, his majestic radiance universally illuminating and inspecting the lands and nations. He summoned the celestial immortals and sages, the myriad celestial dragon kings, the jade maidens and immortal youths of the dragon palaces—seven thousand two hundred in number—as well as the spirits and deities governing the mountains, rivers, pools, and caves within their domains, all assembling at the sacred gathering to gaze upon his august countenance and listen to the proclamation of the true Dharma. Then, winds howled and thunder roared, sweet rains poured down in torrents, the sagely grace flowed like mist, washing away all inauspiciousness, and the lands rejoiced in peace and prosperity.\n\nAt that time, among the assembly, there was a lofty Daoist master named *Mingluo*, who stepped forward from the crowd, prostrated himself, and paid homage, saying: \"By virtue of past blessings, your servant has been privileged to attend upon your august presence. Through the great and lesser *yangjiu* calamities, I have been bathed in your grace, yet I remain ignorant. I humbly inquire: within the six *jia* cycles, from whence do the annual disasters arise? I implore your compassionate illumination and the bestowal of your boundless grace, that this withered wood may encounter the warmth of spring, and the dried fish may meet the life-giving spring rains.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy addressed him, saying: \"This principle is profound and distant; you should return to your place, and I shall reveal it to you. From the very inception of heaven and earth, I established the celestial *jiazi*, the terrestrial *jiazi*, and the human *jiazi*. The human *jiazi* is marked by the succession of the four seasons, the progression of yang through the pitch-pipes, and the movement of yin through the phases. Thus are divided the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan, each Yuan governing sixty years. Now I shall expound the prosperity, scarcity, fortune, and misfortune of each year within a Yuan. You should transcribe this as I speak, that it may be shown to later generations and the years of disaster and blessing be made manifest.\n\nWhen one encounters the first yang, let them adjust their conduct with sincerity and early supplicate for divine protection.\n\nThus is the ode recited:\n\n**Jiazi Year:** In autumn, the tillers bear bitter sorrow.\nThe grain sprouts fail to ripen, calamity harms the fields.\nBut mark the time after autumn’s onset—\nHigh fields cannot be preserved.\nToiling through winter and spring,\nFathers and sons flee their homes.\nBrothers become strangers on the

autumn merge with the vast rivers.\nChu and Lu suffer these calamities,\nWhile Wu and Yue receive grace.\nThat year brings abundant harvests,\nPlanting should all be done early.\n\n**Gengchen Year:** The people of Yan and Wei rise up.\nLivestock fare likewise,\nThe sprouts are devoured by pests.\nThe mountainsides are fit for labor,\nThe people of Wu rejoice in their toil.\nLowlands suffer flooding,\nBut mid and high fields are most bountiful.\n\n**Xinsi Year:** At the eaves’ end, fish play in the gutters.\nFish swim through the streets and lanes,\nThe rice sprouts flourish on the hills.\nPlanting should press forward,\nLabor should not lag behind.\nLowlands hold disaster,\nBut mid and high fields are most abundant.\n\n**Renwu Year:** In spring, flood and drought are not in harmony.\nWhere it is dry, a thousand *li* are troubled,\nWhere it is low, fish sport in play.\nNot only is there famine,\nBut also the frequent fear of war.\nPlague and miasma arise year after year,\nHunger and hardship are also manifold.\n\n**Guiwei Year:** Five households share a single well.\nSpring and summer meet with miasma,\nAutumn brings floods once more.\nBut mark the lands of Wu and Chu,\nAnd also those in Shandong.\nTo the west, famine arises—\nThe farmers should but labor on.\n\n**Jiashen Year:** Gathering, the fears are not long in coming.\nChariots roll through flooded lakes,\nHorses gallop at the Three Rivers’ mouth.\nThose who move their homes surely do not return—\nThis is the fault of calamity.\nRice emerges along the Five Lakes’ shores,\nPlanting the mountainsides is of no use.\n\n**You Year:** In shifting, spring drought must surely come.\"\n\nThree households share a single well,\nDisasters link from Wu’s grand meet.\nWhere livelihoods take root,\nAll yearn for the Five Lakes’ shore.\nNo need to till the mountain slopes—\nHigh ground lies barren as waste.\n\n**Bingxu Year:** Autumn brings dried-up wells and springs.\nThough summer’s

instead.\n\n**Yiwei Year:** Fields lie at the Three Rivers’ mouth.\nWu’s land feeds its people,\nYet Jingzhao bears disaster’s weight.\nNot only scorching blight—\nOminous ills vie to

Heavenly Worthy concluded his hymn of disaster and fortune. The Radiant Perfected Lord Ming Luo and the assembled immortals, each adjusting their dignified attire, advanced together to bow in reverence: \"We, by virtue of past karmic blessings, have been granted the fortune to encounter the Compassionate Worthy, who has proclaimed the cycles of fortune through kalpas, revealed the revolving numbers of disaster, opened the pearl-like eyes of understanding, and chiseled through the caves of ignorance, that those of the coming kalpa may prepare for inauspicious years. We cannot contain our joy and gratitude for the boundless grace of creation.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembled immortals: \"What I have just recited does not yet exhaust the origin. There remain two *jia* years in the cycle, still distant, which cannot be revealed all at once lest my celestial design be prematurely disclosed. Now, I shall impart to you a wondrous method, to be transmitted to those of faithful and righteous disposition. Take care that the vulgar and foolish do not learn of it. This secret method foretells a year’s abundance or famine, safety or peril, and the rise and fall of the five grains. You must carve it into your bones and remember it well, keeping it within your hearts alone. Do not reveal it to the reckless, the faithless, or the base.\"\n\nThen he intoned:\n*\"On New Year’s Day and the advent of spring,*\n*First meet the Tiger or Hare.*\n*If delayed to the third or fourth watch,*\n*Pass not the fifth day.*\n*Should this term be met,*\n*Grain will be cheap, the people free from suffering.*\n*If it falls within the seventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth,*\n*Rice will be dear, the year lean, and rain scarce.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke to the assembled immortals: \"I compose this hymn to be passed down eternally to my disciples, that they may foresee inauspicious years and lean seasons, and prepare by storing grain. Should disaster’s portion descend, then deploy my rites of exorcism and prayer. Choose a solitary peak or sheer cliff, or a place between water and mountain; failing that, an ancient sacred site or altar, or even a public courtyard or orchid-strewn wilds—anywhere pure and unsullied, far from filth and defilement. There, in accordance with the strict codes of the Three Caverns, establish an altar and set up the ritual implements.\n\nIf acting for the king, the chief minister, the prefect, or the magistrate, then array a three-tiered sacred altar, open twenty-four gates, and set out twenty-four incense feasts. With wholehearted devotion, invoke the Three Pure Dao, the Five Venerable Lords of the Great Beginning, the officials of the Three Primes, the immortals and divine officers of the forty-six grotto-heavens, and the spirits of famous mountains, great rivers, abysses, and marshes. Hold a fast for three days to disperse the altar, and conduct a grand offering, adjusting its scale to the abundance or scarcity of resources. Recite the scriptures for summoning dragons, and present memorials on yellow silk. Alternatively, compose a memorial in devotion to the Dao, spoken aloud with utmost sincerity. Do not treat the rites with negligence.\n\nThe vulgar and base, however, first slight the true sages of the heavens, and second, scorn officials and the common people. They mobilize the masses in vain, squander resources, and thus their prayers go unanswered, while incurring grave karmic retribution. Those who practice my teachings must proceed with awe and caution.\"\n\nThen the Radiant Perfected Lord Ming Luo and the assembled immortals, having received the Heavenly Worthy’s guidance on abundance and famine, disaster and fortune, and his instruction in the rites of exorcism and prayer, each adjusted their robes and crowns and bowed in reverent prostration.\n\nThe various Perfected Lords and High Ministers each mounted their phoenix carriages and dragon chariots, attending the Heavenly Worthy as they ascended back to the Jade Realm, where they were received with welcoming rites. The divine spirits and the assembly who had heard the Dharma all returned to their original stations.\n\n*Thus concludes Scroll Eighteen of the* Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra.\n*Scroll Nineteen of the* Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra: *The Decree to the Heavenly Demons*\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in the Land of Great Blessing’s Palace of Eternal Joy, sat upon a throne woven of seven-jeweled treasures alongside the Boundless Great Sage, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings. As he expounded the *Great Expulsion Sutra of the Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations*, he summoned the Ten Directions’ Kings of the Samadhi Divine Incantations and the Flying Transcendent Perfected Great Spirits of the Mysterious and Wondrous Heavens to gather before his seat.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: \"Have you heard that along the ten borders of the Land of Great Blessing in the Palace of Eternal Joy, demonic ghosts recklessly arise, harming the men and women of the multitude, so that the sound of sorrow and suffering is ever present?\"\n\nThe Dao Lord replied: \"This realm has been the World of Ultimate Bliss for seven billion five hundred million kalpas, and there has been no sound of lamentation. Since the era of Dragon Han, however, the men and women of the people have all been born with fierce and murderous natures, offering lewd prayers to the various demonic spirits, vainly seeking to sustain their lives. Since that time of awakening, for seven billion five hundred million kalpas, the people have suffered poverty and hardship, their forms withering with age and illness. Whether man or woman, all share the same intent, flattering and beseeching evil ghosts. The residual *qi* of the Six Heavens, bearing the nine-fold ugliness of the Wood Essence’s demonic illusions, enters their hearts, giving rise to violent rebellion. They kill the innocent without cause, and the power of evil spirits grows ever stronger.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Five Venerable Celestial Emperors to summon the Ten Great Demons of Heaven, the Lords of the Three Realms, and the Great Soldiers of the Supreme Perfected Divine Armies—countless myriads—to capture all the ghosts who had slipped from the registers of the world. He asked: \"Which of them harm the people, causing the lands to know no great peace, the people to bear many debts, and life and death to hold no tranquility?\"\n\nThe Perfected Kings of the Three Heavens, along with the Three Heavens’ Great Soldiers of the Ten Directions’ Divine Perfected, roamed the borders of the lands. For all people, they healed illness, aided the upright *qi* of Heaven, slew and extinguished evil essences, and rescued the lives of the multitude, all through the power of the Dao, preserving their heavenly destinies.\n\n\"From this day forward, if there are Daoist priests who submit to the Three Caverns, receive and uphold this sutra, and carry its Dharma to travel the world, healing the sick so that they may recover and know no premature death—should any ghost refuse to depart or dare to act wickedly against such a Daoist priest in the course of healing, I shall dispatch the Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens with their armies to bind and capture them, exterminating their factions and cutting off their influence in other lands.\"\n\nThe Dao declared: \"Within the Three Realms, from this day forward, in the perverse and doomed lands of the latter kalpas, where yin *qi* and turbid evil arise, change will swiftly come. Simplicity and purity having been lost, frivolity and competition will flourish. In the Four Heavens and Eight Directions below, those who style themselves as Demon Kings of the Divine will emerge, naming themselves the Heavenly Spirits of a turbid and evil age, spreading throughout the lower realms. Within the Four Heavens, the mountain and forest stone essences will possess living people, men and women alike imitating and learning from one another, calling themselves Heavenly Kings. Together with the residual *qi* ghosts of the Six Heavens and the ghosts who have slipped from the world’s registers, they will form factions, branching and dispersing, adopting names in accordance with the times, bringing calamity to the myriad people. They will cause people to pray and supplicate, flattering and beseeching for protection, turning their backs on the Dao to believe in evil, offering food and seeking blessings. These ghosts will grow ever more powerful, gnawing at people’s essence and *qi*, consuming their blood and vessels, cutting short their years. Unaware, people will allow them to enter their bodies, causing them to despise life and love death. Such ghosts, in numbers beyond count, will bewitch men and women alike.\n\nWherever a Daoist priest travels to heal such afflictions, I shall dispatch the Great Spirits of the Ten Directions and the Envoys of the Five Peaks—three hundred thousand in number—to assist the Daoist in healing illness. From this day forward, in the years of *jiashen* and *renchen*, great armies will arise in the world, and plague demons will kill people, nine out of every ten. The world will be vast and desolate, the people distressed and suffering, their rulers indifferent. Thirty kinds of illness will afflict the world, beyond all cure. If there are Daoist priests who submit to the *Three Caverns Divine Incantations Sutra*, I shall send down the Great Divine Soldiers of Heaven to assist them in healing illness. They shall invoke the Great Kings of the Samadhi Divine Incantations to lead a host of one hundred thousand red-armored soldiers and golden-armored warriors. They shall also summon the Generals of the Nine Heavens’ Punitive Campaigns—four hundred thousand strong. And the Green-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the Red-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the White-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the *Qi*-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the Yellow-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the Great Soldiers of Prohibitions and Slaughter—four hundred thousand. And the Great Officers of the Azure Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the Red Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the White Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the Black Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the Yellow Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. Each shall lead armies of countless myriads, wielding the triple-armored implements for slaying ghosts to assist the Daoist in healing illness. Should any ghost dare to act with malicious poison, or any evil person direct their malevolent intent toward this Daoist, they shall be slain one by one, leaving no trace of harm to people or ghosts, thereby manifesting the divine efficacy of the Great Dao.\"\n\nThe Dao declared: \"If a Daoist priest dwells in hidden mountain valleys or among the people, they should wholeheartedly rescue those in peril and dire distress, reciting the sutras and performing the Daoist rites thrice daily. After reciting the sutras and performing the rites for one to three days, they shall face north in the central courtyard and present the *Precious Chapter of the Great Expulsion* once. They shall also wear the Registers of the Great Talismans of the Nine Heavens, inscribed on silk, and don the divine talismans. Thus, the sick shall swiftly recover, and no harm shall come to people or ghosts—all shall be resolved clearly and completely. These ghostly spirits shall each gather pestilence and seize poisons for the Daoist, aiding them in healing the sick.\"\n\nThe Dao declared: \"From this day forward, if any Daoist priest practices the *Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Three Caverns* but does not wear the *Great Expulsion Scripture*, the hundred demons shall not submit, the spirits shall not aid them, and their healing of the sick shall not succeed. From this day forward, if any Daoist priest wholeheartedly embraces the Dao, their aspiration fixed upon the Three Caverns, and receives this *Great Expulsion Scripture of the Three Heavens* along with the Four Great Talismans of Pacification, they shall subdue all manner of ghosts. Wherever such a Daoist priest may go in the world, the ten thousand ghosts shall pay homage. Should any dare to cause harm, when the Daoist priest recites the scriptures and performs the rites, they shall command the people to refrain from clamor and foul speech. Then, the ninety myriad great soldiers of the Nine Heavens shall shield the Daoist priest, assisting in the healing of the sick, and none shall dare to transgress.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"From this day forward, if any Daoist priest recites the scriptures for a single night and expounds the great Dharma of the Three Caverns and the great *Expulsion Scripture*, demonic harms shall be stirred, malevolent spirits shall lose their essence, the thunder of the Dharma shall resound, heavenly soldiers shall array themselves, fire shall flow for ten thousand miles, fire bells and shooting stars shall rush forth, the Nine Uglies shall be slain, demonic spirits shall be beheaded, pestilence shall be swept away, and the sick shall recover from their afflictions. People and ghosts shall suffer no harm—you and all your myriad kinds shall be banished. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the *Great Expulsion* decrees!\"\n\nThe True Kings of the Three Heavens addressed the people, men and women alike: \"If any can wholeheartedly embrace the Dao, delighting in the Three Caverns, and receive and uphold this scripture, enshrining it in their home, then on the day of the Great Expulsion, when ghostly soldiers might wrongfully slaughter, and the calamity of the great kalpa draws near, neither people nor ghosts shall be able to distinguish themselves from one another. From this day forward, if any Daoist priest is single-minded, bearing the sun and moon upon their head, carrying the stars upon their shoulders, revering and delighting in the True Dao, and aiding the rectification of Heaven’s *qi*, they may present forty feet of white silk, a pair of golden rings, five feet of five-colored silk, and precious incense of descending truth. At a pure and numinous abode, in the mountains or marshes, they shall establish an altar and offer a grand jiao to the Five Emperors. With the Three Samadhi Divine Incantations, the Great Expulsion Talismans, the red and black *qi*, and the Four Great Talismans of Pacification, they shall seal the springs so that they dry up, seal the mountains so that they crumble, seal the rivers so that they run dry, seal fire so that it is extinguished, seal spirits so that they perish, and seal ghosts so that they are destroyed. The prohibitions of the Three Heavens shall subdue all hidden things.\n\nFrom this day forward, wherever a Daoist priest holds these Great Expulsion divine incantations and talismans, I shall assist them in healing the sick, capturing all ghosts who have escaped the registers, and delivering them to the prisons of the Three Heavens to be punished. Thus shall the divine efficacy of the Great Dao be made manifest. When healing the sick, the Daoist priest shall recite this scripture and perform the rites, revealing their practice at the six periods of the day. They shall inscribe the divine talismans and great registers upon red and black silk. These shall be given to the sick to wear for pacification, all in accordance with the scriptural regulations. When healing the sick, the Daoist priest must act with a single mind, rescuing those in dire peril, and must not demand recompense or harbor greed. Heaven shall diminish their Dao-power—what immortality could they attain?\n\nThis talisman commands the demonic soldiers and horses of the Five Emperors, along with the ninety myriad heavenly soldiers of the Three Caverns, to guard and protect it. If a Daoist priest does not receive this talisman, the hundred ghosts and thousand demons shall not fear them. But if they wear this talisman, the ten thousand demons shall pay homage, all ghosts shall praise its virtue, and the assembled multitudes shall bow their heads, each requesting to uphold it.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"The great kalpa is nigh, and the Three Calamities—blades, pestilence, water, and fire—draw near. Before the *ren-chen* year, waters shall surge ten thousand fathoms, ghostly soldiers shall slaughter people, and pestilence shall abound, sparing not a single region. I now lead the numinous consorts of the various heavens, the divine perfected of the ten directions, and the officials of the Three Realms to descend into the world and save all beings from illness. If any embrace the Dao and delight in the scriptures of the Three Caverns, receiving and upholding the divine incantations, the Three Samadhi, and the great talismans of expulsion, they shall dwell within the Nine Palaces, behind the Three Dragons, and be appointed as heavenly officials. In the Jade Registers, they shall be spared the Three Calamities and Nine Perils. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the *Great Expulsion* decrees!\"\n\nThe Dao declared: \"Within the Three Realms, there are many gods and demons. The demon kings possess abundant poisons and slaughter living beings, heedless of Heaven’s majesty. From this day forward, I command the vanguard Lu’s prohibition soldiers, numbering in the billions and myriads. There are also the Five Ding Envoys, ninety myriad strong. There are the prohibition soldiers of the Three Heavens, thirty myriad strong. And there are the Red Ding Clerical Soldiers, forty-nine myriad strong. Together, they shall descend to heal all illnesses of humankind.\"\n\nIf Daoist priests submit to the Three Caverns, perform the Dao, recite scriptures to save others, they must first establish a quiet chamber, paint the true portraits of the Five Thearchs and the supreme true visages of the Three Caverns, and erect a Three Caverns ritual arena. Therein, they shall broadly dispel misfortune and invoke blessings for the world, eliminating calamities and averting disasters. Should men or women bring incense to the ritual arena, beseeching treatment for illness, the priests shall, according to their wealth or poverty, prepare vegetarian feasts and offer prayers, invoking the gods of the Five Thearchs and bestowing upon them talismanic charms to wear. For those whose illnesses are cured, I shall banish you, myriad demonic spirits, in ranks of thousands. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the *Great Expulsion* decrees!\n\nThe celestial maidens of the Three Heavens and the multicolored maidens of the ten directions, along with the divine consorts of the heavens, each bearing the Ten Absolute Spirit Banners for summoning demons, jade staffs, and jeweled canopies, and riding upon dragon-phoenix carriages, shall descend for all living beings to disseminate the true *qi* of the Three Heavens. Thus, the people of the world shall all awaken to remorse, revere our Three Treasures, and turn toward the Great Dao. Passing beyond the *jiashen* year, they shall be recorded in the Jade Registers and spared the Three Calamities and Nine Perils. You, plague demons, shall cease your poisonous rampage and no longer kill; all beings shall attain safety, free from harm. From this day forward, if any Daoist priest arouses a heart of great compassion, cherishes all without distinction, and single-mindedly practices the Three Caverns to save others, I shall assist the priest in healing the sick. Wherever this scripture is recited, all ghosts and spirits shall flee in terror. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the *Great Expulsion* decrees!\n\nThe Dao declared: \"From this day forward, if any Daoist priest in the world upholds this scripture, turns toward the Seven Perfected, wears and serves the divine talismans, and saves all beings afflicted with illness, they shall be given talismans to wear and memorials to present, offering prayers to the gods of the Five Thearchs, so that their illnesses may be cured and they may pass beyond the Three Calamities and Nine Perils. If any Daoist priest renounces worldly burdens, single-mindedly devotes themselves to the Dharma, and resolves to practice the Three Caverns to heal the sick, reducing their own clothing and food, relinquishing wealth and silk, and distributing alms to the poor to aid all beings, then the gods of Heaven and Earth shall establish their merit, and they shall immediately perceive the true Dao. The lords of the Three Heavens shall assist the Daoist priest in practicing the Dao, and all ghosts and spirits shall tremble in fear. They shall no longer come to kill the people; I dispatch the demon kings of the *Great Expulsion* to execute them in succession. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the decrees!\"\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this day forward, if any Daoist priest, ruler, emperor, regional lord, or magistrate believes in the scriptures, upholds Our Three Caverns, and receives the wondrous qi, they shall enable others to ascend as immortals. Those who cultivate and uphold the Way among the upper immortals shall grow feathered wings and soar freely. Those among the middle immortals shall conceal themselves at will. Those among the lower immortals shall command ghosts and spirits. At that time, when the perfected of the Three Caverns ascend as immortals, their fame shall spread afar, and the thirsting multitudes of the ten directions shall gaze in reverence. Beneath the Four Heavens, all men and women shall burn incense, bow their heads, and lift their thoughts to Heaven, yearning for the Great Dao to descend upon the world. With compassionate radiance universally bestowed, ruler and minister shall employ the Dao, mutually supporting one another, bringing great peace to the realm and everlasting prosperity to their reigns.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this day forward, in the years of *jiǎ-shēn* and *rén-chén*, plague demons numbering nine hundred thousand shall descend and spread across the world, inflicting ten thousand kinds of illness, maladies beyond cure. If there are Daoist priests who uphold the Three Caverns, recite the scriptures, and practice the Dao, employing the qi of the Three and Five to ward off evil, they shall bind these demons, banish them to distant lands, and pacify the spirits of household elders, community altars, and sacred turtles, ensuring all remain unharmed. When illness strikes, if a Daoist priest of the Three Caverns recites the scriptures, practices the Dao, burns incense, lights lamps, hangs silken banners and canopies, scatters flowers, and chants praises in the six periods, then on the day the rites conclude, they shall perform offerings and supplications to the Five Emperors. The Five Marchmounts, Four Rivers, Nine Water Lords, Twelve Stream Sources, cavernous grottoes, dragon kings, and all officials of the heavens, the Three Realms, their divine retinues, down to the Six Paths, Four Births, and the dark underworld—all shall momentarily feel remorse and be banished to distant lands.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this day forward, if any Daoist priest submits to the Three Caverns and travels to a land where the sick reside to heal them, they shall summon the Celestial Prohibited Soldiers of the Three Heavens, the Chief Scribes, the Perfected Divine Lords of the Ten Directions, the Twelve Karma Officers, the Nine Heavens’ Demon-Seizing Envoys, the Ghost-Capturing Officers, the Treachery-Seizing Officers, the Great Demon-Expelling Kings, the Crimson Capital Envoys, and the Heavenly Might Warriors, leading their retinues of four hundred eighty thousand to descend and assist this Daoist priest in healing the sick.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Upon hearing the recitation of this scripture nearing its end, all these perfected immortals—heavenly men and women, divine consorts, and immortal youths—shall bow their heads in reverence, believing, receiving, and upholding it.\n\nThe *Divine Talisman for Beheading Ghosts in the Prisons of Hell* shall be written in black ink, placed in a crimson pouch, and worn upon the head.\nThe *Talisman for Dispelling All Myriad Evils* shall be written in black ink on white silk and worn upon the head.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Daoist priests shall inscribe divine talismans and cast them into springs to suppress and seal the hundred demons of the world, regardless of their size. When reciting the scriptures and practicing the Dao, they shall present the *Precious Chapter of the Great Expulsion and Execution* and orally summon the officers and soldiers.\n\nThis talisman shall be written in vermilion.\n\nThe nineteenth scroll of the *Supreme Pervasive Divine Incantations Scripture* concludes here.\nThe twentieth scroll of the *Supreme Pervasive Divine Incantations Scripture* begins.\n\n**Chapter on Dispelling Ghosts Through the Long Night**\n\nThe Dao speaks: Long ago, I traveled with Wen Shi and Red Pine Master, leading seventy thousand Brahma Kings, roaming the outskirts of the Five Ridges in the world. We saw those who had died by the blade—not merely one or two. The Most High, moved by compassion, dispatched transformed Daoist priests to ask them: *\"What crimes have you committed to suffer such torment?\"* Each answered: *\"We endure this cruel agony, yet know not its cause. We only beseech the Great Compassion to bestow its decree upon the transformed ones.\"*\n\nThe Dao said: *\"Hark! Do you not know? The great kalpa draws near, and the waters shall soon rise. All the people of the world shall become as mud. Such as you are not few. Why do you not cultivate the Dao and thus endure forever? You covet wealth and rank, fleeting as a moment, and so fail to attain transcendence through ten thousand kalpas. You see no good roots, and thus remain obscured by heaven and earth, bound to calamity as your fate. The world is impure, and the Five Thieves lead men astray, drawing them into evil destinies. They drain men’s spirit-qi and cast them into the abyss. One misstep, and regret comes too late.\"*\n\nAs the Most High spoke these words, thirty-nine thousand in the assembly, one hundred thousand heavenly maidens, two hundred thirty thousand transformed ones beneath the earth, and four hundred ninety thousand Daoist priests and demon kings—men and women alike—all rose in astonishment, seeking to receive this scripture. From this day forth, they vowed to uphold this Dharma, to teach and transform the foolish, that they might no longer crave official rank or royal station. Each swore: *\"Today, we have heard the Celestial Worthy’s words and shall act upon them, daring not to disobey.\"* They removed their garments to receive the scripture.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the world’s latter age, thirty-nine thousand people shall attain the rank of Upper Immortal, ascending upon the Most High’s nine dragons. Three hundred million heavenly beings shall traverse the lands, welcoming Daoist priests of immortal bone. In that era, great floods shall arise, and ghostly armies shall clash. Countless men and women shall perish. Now, I specially dispatch transformed ones to journey across the Four Seas, commanding all to prepare the scriptures and receive the *Precious Chapter of the Great Expulsion*, donning its protective signs. Among them, those with faith shall hear and rejoice, seeking the transformed ones to receive it. But those who disbelieve shall hear yet remain unmoved, drifting aimlessly into the nine rivers and three streams until all perish. Alas!\n\nThe Most High, riding upon five-colored clouds in the void, gazed down in great compassion, lamenting the foolishness of these beings. *\"Alas, alas! How shall I save them?\"* Then, mounting a dragon, He led the heavenly hosts, all the sage-kings, and a hundred million immortals of the Five Peaks into the midst of the great flood to rescue those of steadfast faith, granting them fearlessness. Great ravens bore them aloft to the Nine Heavens. The dragon-borne ascents spanned ten thousand leagues in breadth, some two thousand nine hundred leagues, others one thousand two hundred leagues. There were eighty million such ascents, each capable of carrying three hundred million people. Yet those who did not receive the scriptures, who heard not the Dharma, who kept no fasts, who knew not the Dharma-realm—none could board these ascents.\n\nThough the transformed ones sought to rescue them as the great waters rose, the Beam Spirits and Controller Officials would slay them, seizing the sinners and casting them back into the waters. Yet the Most High, the Perfect Sage, could still save them, and the flying immortals—men and women—assisted in delivering the people. Countless great ravens arrived as one, bearing away those of virtuous conduct.\n\n*\"You Daoist priests, having now seen this* Great Expulsion Scripture *and heard the Most High, and beheld His form and image—you shall indeed encounter the dragon-borne ascents in future lives. The words of the sages are not empty!\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: These immortals and jade maidens were born before heaven and earth, enduring many kalpas. Now, they join Me in teaching and transforming the foolish. Only those with immortal bone may behold their forms. You, in turn, must each transmit this teaching to later generations—men and women alike—who, if they receive it together, shall not die untimely deaths. When the great flood comes, they shall not be among the drowned.\n\nThe great assembly, hearing the Celestial Worthy’s words, wept in sorrow and sought to receive and uphold them. Moved by compassion, the Most High commanded the transformed ones to enter the mountains and erect an altar, where eighty million men and women from the multitude received the scripture. The demon kings and their followers, unable to attend, pledged their faith and came to the mountains to receive it.\n\nThe Dao speaks: *\"You who receive this* Precious Scripture of the Great Expulsion *—its essentials shall make you immortals. Diligently transform and deliver others, passing it on to the foolish. The foolish, with their inverted views, are pitiable indeed. In the coming age, the great flood shall engulf them. The sages see the foolish living heedlessly, like men observing worms in a privy—unaware of when they might emerge. You Daoist priests who fail to transform them shall remain forever mired in birth and death.\"*\n\nThe great assembly—immortals of the Five Peaks, all four divisions, heavenly beings, men and women—all sighed in unison: *\"Excellent! We too shall uphold this!\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: Beyond the Northern Sea lies the land of the Yilin Kingdom, comprising forty-eight thousand households. They do not believe in the Dao or its laws, killing living beings for their own use. Their land is in turmoil, and the people rebel, slaughtering three hundred each day. The Most High, seeing the great flood approaching and the foolish unaware, committing sins that cast them into evil destinies—when would they ever escape?—entered the Dark Mountain and observed all beings drifting aimlessly. Whither were they bound? Then, He released the light from within His body, illuminating the ten directions. He dispatched transformed ones from the ten directions to fly through the void to the land of Yilin.\n\nThe kings, seeing them, were greatly alarmed: *\"These beings ride the empty air—what are they? Are they not demonic spirits?\"* They immediately sent thirty thousand men to shoot arrows upward. Yet the arrows turned back and struck their own people dead—who then revived.\n\nThe officials could not kill them and reported to the king. Enraged, the king dispatched thirty thousand soldiers to slay them, yet still they could not be killed. The flying immortals descended, filling the entire kingdom. The land overflowed with them, transforming in an instant into women, children, and elders—countless millions of forms. The king, seized with terror, prostrated himself before the flying immortals and said: *\"We are sinners, unaware that a great sage had descended. From this day forth, we take the immortals as our masters. We humbly beg your acceptance.\"*\n\nThe immortals replied: *\"We are not worthy to be your masters. We too have our own original master, known as the Heavenly Worthy. If you truly possess such devotion, we shall take you to report to Him.\"* They then led the king and his retinue to the transformed ones of the Most High. At once, the king and all within the kingdom vanished, leaving the land eerily empty.\n\nThe king and his ministers declared: *\"These immortals are great sages. We must transform our hearts and serve them.\"* The transformed ones, perceiving their sincerity, converted all the people of the kingdom, each receiving the Dao, along with talismans, scriptures, and covenants, and they performed the rites of purification. From that time, beyond the Northern Sea, the Dao flourished.\n\nThe king and his minister Ma Xuan asked: *\"How ought one who receives these scriptures honor their master?\"* The transformed ones replied: *\"One who receives these scriptures must revere their master as the sun and moon, and honor the scriptures as pearls and jade. Never slight the scriptures, never belittle the master. The master is like heaven, the scriptures like the sun—heaven cannot be destroyed, the sun cannot be touched. Ascension to immortality and deliverance from the world depend entirely upon the master. Without a master, one cannot obtain these scriptures; without the scriptures, one cannot ascend to immortality.*\n\n*You who serve a master must never harbor resentment, nor speak their name in vain even after a single night. The Dao does not tolerate dual loyalties—reverence must come from the heart without deceit. If you disobey, your head shall shatter into seven pieces.\"*\n\nThe Dao spoke: When the great flood comes, in the Middle Kingdom there shall be the immortals Tang Ping, Yu Guang, and Ma Qi, leading eighty thousand heavenly beings. These immortals shall ride iron boats to receive Daoists who possess the scriptures—you must await them. When these immortals arrive, above them will be five-colored clouds, a circular canopy stretching three million *li*. Within it, one hundred thousand jade maidens shall shine with radiant red and white light, shimmering brilliantly—this is the coming of the immortals. You must await them.\n\nA Daoist of the Eastern Grove asked: *\"We do not know which scriptures one must receive to behold the immortals and escape the Three Calamities.\"*\n\nThe Most High replied: *\"The* Upper Clarity Numinous Treasure Samādhi of Infinite Wonders *will suffice. Yet if a Daoist does not receive the* Great Expulsion Scripture*, they shall not cross the three great rivers nor escape the calamities of the kalpa. Why is this? The* Great Expulsion Scripture *is the foremost among scriptures, the king of the thirty-six divisions of scriptures—none surpass it. It is the grand regulator of all scriptures; to receive it is to complete the scriptures. Daoist men and women, unless their former lives bore the bones of immortality, may not receive this scripture. It shares the same womb as the* Infinite Wonders Scripture*—in practice and application, it is identical to the methods of the* Infinite Wonders.* If one seeks immortal ascension, one must study the* Infinite Treasure Scripture*. A Daoist who does not receive the* Infinite Great Expulsion Scripture *is no Daoist at all.\"*\n\nAmong the eighty-four thousand present, all heard the Most High’s words. Each bowed thrice and sought to receive it, vowing to uphold it. The disciples, from this day forth, shall carry this scripture to transform all people under heaven. Those who fully receive it shall be transformed in every way.\n\nThe Dao spoke: *\"Humans possess three hun-souls and seven po-souls. At death, they scatter and are driven into the Five Shades. Thus, the dead may meet fortune or misfortune. Those who die in the third month of spring are slain by the emissaries of the Great Yang, ruled by the Lord of the Nine Yi. Ninety myriad great spirits select them, their might like boiling broth. The stars above shall dim, and their fate shall be severed. If one performs rituals and enters samādhi, refining the corpse ten times, the seven po-souls shall attain non-action. They shall avoid the Five Sufferings, ascend to the Mud Pill Palace, and abide by the Primordial Method. Protected by heavenly beings, their good and evil shall be distinguished. If, after death, someone recites this scripture for them, eight hundred million great spirits shall deliver their departed souls, restoring them to rebirth in heaven. If reborn among humans, they shall become lords and elders, their clothing and sustenance naturally provided, sparing them from suffering. Wherever this ritual is performed, eight hundred million heavenly beings and jade maidens shall descend to witness it. The merit of the Daoist shall bring blessings to the living and ascension to the dead—all through the power of the commemorative ritual.\"*\n\nThe Dao spoke: *\"Those who die in the third month of summer are slain by the Great Yin Controller of Destiny of the Vast Forest, ruled by the Lord of the Eight Man. Eighty myriad spirits select them, and the stars above shall dim, their fate forever severed. From this day forth, if someone dies and this scripture is recited for them, the departed shall not be displaced. If they cannot ascend to heaven or be reborn among humans, I shall dispatch the Radiant Immortal Great Yu, Immortal Qian Zhi, and Immortal Fang Sheng, each leading thirty-nine thousand heavenly soldiers and one hundred thousand mighty warriors, to smite the demon kings, selection officials, and the ten refining spirits, preventing them from ascending. They shall remain as lowly ghosts, forever barred from immortality. This is the decree from the golden mouth of the Most High—once issued, there shall be no pardon. As the Most High commands, so shall it be. If you, lesser demon kings, heed this edict, you may yet ascend. If you enforce it without deviation, but fail to carry out the decree, ninety myriad great spirits wielding crimson staves shall bludgeon the evil ghosts to death. The officials of the Five Paths and the selection spirits of the ten directions must act in their own interest, ensuring the dead are not reported above. If word reaches the heavens, you shall be the first to face judgment—the golden mouth of the Most High shall show no mercy. All shall follow the words of the Most High Perfected. Those who disobey shall see the heads of demon kings and ghost kings shattered into sixteen pieces.\"*\n\nThe Dao spoke: *\"Those who die in the third month of autumn are slain by the Six Harms—great epidemics, water, fire, and misfortunes—ruled by the Lord of the Six Rong. Sixty billion selection spirits shall judge them, their names self-generated. The stars above shall dim, and their fate shall be forever severed. From this day forth, those who die and have this scripture recited for them shall have their spirits refined by the officials of the Five Paths. Those who cannot ascend to heaven are guilty of double-tongued slander, wicked speech, harming or killing others, the Five Inverse Acts, unfilial conduct, deceiving their masters, cursing their fathers, or striking their elders. Whether brother, sister, aunt, uncle, or any kin—all shall enter hell for ninety-one kalpas and never ascend to heaven. The heavenly officials shall not tolerate them. Even if this scripture is recited for them, it shall be of no benefit. Their sin is equal to that of slanderers. Daoists must cultivate goodness, transform others, receive the Three Caverns, revere the scriptures, and practice the Dao. If the dead have this scripture recited for them, the spirits shall issue the decree, and the departed shall ascend directly to heaven. From the years *guiwei* and *xinsi* onward, Daoists who transform and deliver others may escape the great flood of the *jiashen* calamity.\"*\n\nThe Dao spoke: *\"Those who die in the third month of winter are slain by the emissaries of the Luminous Decree for failing to practice the Dao, mocking those who do good, and ridiculing the common folk. They are not human in their three hun-souls and seven po-souls, ruled by the Lord of the Five Di. Fifty myriad selection officials shall distinguish their good and evil, and the stars above shall dim, their fate forever severed. From this day forth, the dead shall have their spirits refined. The Lord of Spirit Refinement commands eight hundred million spirits to ensure the departed ascend to heaven, where heavenly maidens shall welcome them. Though they may not attain flying immortality, they shall be reborn as humans.\"*\n\n\"Through ten refinements, the corpse is quickened; from the ten directions, guests arrive. The world selects together—none may descend to rebirth. Should they fall into the Three Wretched Realms, the fault lies with the demon kings. The Registrar of Mount Tai, the Lords of the Five Paths, and the immortal officials of the sacred mountains—if they fail to attend with care and cause the departed to suffer trials, you shall be the first to bear punishment. The Supreme August One’s oral decree is never empty.\n\nWhen Daoists transform others, fortune and misfortune depend on the fast; the gods of the fast shall guard their bodies.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Those who die in penal servitude are governed by the Civil Scribes. Those who die of cold or heat are governed by the Luminous Kings. Those who die from falling from cliffs or trees are governed by the Fiery Ram Lords. Those who die by blade or weapon are governed by the Sacrificial Officers. Those who die by hanging are governed by the Lady of Creeping Vines. Those who drown are governed by the Dark Lady. Those who die in fire are governed by the Heavenly Aides. Those who die in forests are governed by King He. Those who die of starvation are governed by Meng Ying. Those who die of swellings are governed by Ji Ying. Those who die from needles are governed by the Dragon Kings. Those who die in dreams are governed by Lin Xuan. Those who die of suffocation are governed by Scribe Liu. Those who die of grievous injustice are governed by Zuo Ren. Those who die in madness are governed by Ding Gou. Those who die by self-stabbing are governed by Commander Zhu. Those who drown themselves are governed by Hu Chun. Those who die of chronic illness are governed by Qiao Qiu.\n\nFrom this day forth, if one falls under the jurisdiction of these eighteen death-officials, simply transfer this text to the governing officers. When others recite the scriptures, the gods within the scriptures shall themselves distinguish and cause the living to ascend, while the dead shall be reborn among humans.\n\nFrom the *renwu* and *xinsi* years onward, fortune and misfortune shall all depend on the recitation of this scripture.\n\nThe Dao speaks: All living beings belong to the lunar lodges—Horn, Neck, Root, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, Woman, Emptiness, Danger, House, Wall, Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, and Chariot. If a star has a name, it naturally has a retinue of ten thousand myriad attendants, pacing the roads and paths.\n\nThe Supreme August One, pitying sentient beings, has revealed all the great demon kings. From this day forth, if any household performs great merit by reciting this scripture, swiftly distinguish the departed, causing them to be reborn in heaven, where clothing and food arise spontaneously. If they remain in the Three Wretched Realms, rescue them and lead them out. If their stars have not crossed, cause them to cross. If their stars have not dimmed, cause them to dim. Should they still fail to ascend or remain severed from fate, the great demon kings shall first suffer an aeon of punishment. The Lords of the Five Paths and the Registrar of Mount Tai shall all incur guilt. Their offenses shall surely be met with penalties, and they shall not ascend as immortals.\n\nThe Dao speaks: For those who have died within twenty-one days, whether ten, five, or a hundred years have passed, merit may still be pursued on their behalf. Simply perform the ten refinements of goodness for the departed, practicing the two, five, seven, and nine virtues to establish merit and redress transgressions. If the deceased lacked a register, bestow one upon them. The *Heavenly Yellow Writ of the Mysterious* is this great scripture; to receive this single contract is to encompass all without exception.\n\nIf the living lack a great register, they may also receive the Ten Generals and reverently wear the *Heavenly Yellow Writ* contract, thereby gaining access to the Three Caverns. Bestow it upon those who come, regardless of high or low status. Why is this so?\"\n\nThe Dao is like the sea—how could the sea reject filth and foulness? The great Dharma knows no bounds, and the great person makes no distinctions. When Daoists transform others, take care not to envy one another. Those who envy will have their allotted years seized by the gods and immortals.\n\nThe Dao’s methods are myriad; only the wise expand their thoughts upon them.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this moment, in this place of refining the spirit, I command ninety million heavenly soldiers, eighty thousand warriors of the ten directions, one hundred twenty thousand immortal officials, and three thousand six hundred jade maidens—each wielding a crimson halberd—to strike down all evil ghosts under heaven, to slay those who speak wicked words, and to drive away corrupt officials and thieves. As for all those in white robes who scheme against Daoists, who seek to monopolize or encroach, who deceive these Dharma masters—each shall have their living souls seized and be executed without mercy.\n\nWhen Daoists diligently transform others, the Great Demon King, the Lords of Ghosts, all governing spirits, and the gods who select officials shall pursue the documents on behalf of the deceased. If the departed are confined in the Three Bureaus, condemned to places of suffering, they shall all be reported and released, allowing them to ascend to heaven. Should they fail to remove the deceased from the Three Paths, the officers and soldiers shall be held accountable.\n\nFrom this jiǎxū year onward, among the people of the world who hear the teachings of the Three Caverns, many men and women Daoists will encounter this text—all are those who have descended from heaven. Yet the foolish of the world shall not hear of it.\n\nThe Dao speaks: This *Scripture of Refining the Spirit* is the foremost among scriptures. How is this known? Within this scripture, a single character of the spirit encompasses thirty-six thousand spirits. When people perform purification rites, the spirits hear them. Forty-nine thousand spirits oversee the rites, along with eight thousand Jade Maidens of the Great Beginning and one hundred twenty thousand immortals of Mount Tai, who come to select the deceased. The deceased ascend, and the living gain blessings.\n\nFrom this day forward, Daoists who uphold this Dharma, receive the essentials of the Three Caverns, and teach others to receive them shall themselves enter the ranks of immortals. From the rényǔ year onward, kings, great ministers, regional lords, and officials of two thousand *shi* who receive this scripture—all have bones destined for immortality from past lives. Immortals come to transform them, thus allowing these people to generate faith on their own and encounter great Dharma masters. How fortunate are these men and women! They shall surely ascend as immortals and never fall into the abyss.\n\nThe Dao speaks: If, after a person’s death, the living perform merit on their behalf, the deceased shall regain human form. Once human form is restored, they may ascend to heaven. After ascending to heaven, they shall return to the human realm, where clothing and food come naturally. If they dwell in the world, they shall become teachers of humanity. If they become Daoists and study the Dao, kings shall revere them as masters, and they shall not remain ordinary people. If they become kings, regional lords, officials of two thousand *shi*, or magistrates, their hearts shall constantly dwell on goodness, exhorting others to practice the Dao and personally upholding the Dharma. They shall honor the scriptures of the Three Caverns, revere their masters, and respect the gods, ever steadfast as the sun and moon. Such people shall attain great nobility in this life, passing it down through generations without end.\n\nThe upright appearance of you disciples in this life is also covered by the great Dao. Wealth and nobility, poverty and lowliness—all are decreed by the Dao. Even ugliness is but the qi of the Dao. Simply believe in the Dao with a single heart, for the Dao does not speak falsely.\n\nUpon hearing this Dharma, the countless jade maidens in attendance rejoiced greatly, each performing the three bows and transforming to receive and uphold it on behalf of others.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When people study the Dao, the qi of the Dao runs deep. Though they may not perceive it directly, they should trust the scriptural texts, for the scriptures reveal the Dao. Without scriptures, how could the people of the world know the Dao? The scriptures are the eyes of humanity. Eyes can see far, distinguishing blue from white, good from evil, great from small. Without eyes, nothing is known—so too are the scriptures.\n\nIn studying the Dao, Daoists must first cultivate faith, for only with faith do they gain scriptures. Next, they must serve their masters, for masters guide people. The sages are profoundly distant, hidden and unseen; only masters can be followed. Only those with a predestined affinity for the Dao encounter masters, and thus come to know the Way.\n\nWhen performing purification rites and practicing the Dao, recall your master in every detail. The gods, immortals, and jade maidens shall naturally assist your virtuous heart. The method of purification rites involves practicing the Dao in three periods over one day and two nights.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Long ago, there was a kingdom plagued by tigers and leopards that devoured people on the roads. At that time, a Daoist of the Three Caverns, an official of men and women, entered the mountains to gather herbs. On the way back, they encountered a traveler and asked if there were tigers on the road. The traveler, knowing tigers were present, deceived the Daoist, saying there were none. The Daoists proceeded, and the tiger transformed into a deer, showing no fear or malice toward them. The Daoists, hearing there were no tigers, rejoiced and hastened on their way. The gods protected them, knowing the traveler had deceived the Daoists. With a righteous heart, heaven naturally shielded and guarded them. Thus, the method of Daoists lies solely in establishing faith. Those who maintain faith shall naturally be supported.\n\nThere was Jiao Mai of the Southern Sea, who led eighty people into the mountains to seek immortality. They dwelled there for seven years, and each day a hundred thousand evil ghosts descended to test them. The Daoists and their assembly remained fearless, saying, “We uphold the contract of the Supreme and Boundless. How could you petty ghosts frighten us?” With unwavering faith, the ghosts departed of their own accord. The Daoists were transformed by heavenly maidens and later all ascended as immortals. Thus, Daoists need only maintain faith in their hearts.\n\nThis occurred during the reign of Empress Huì of the Western Jìn, when the Sima clan crossed the Yangtze to the south. In the jiǎzǐ year, the Six Barbarians invaded China. With no ruler in the Central Kingdom, the Sima clan moved to the land of Wú, establishing an emperor on the left bank of the Yangtze. Later, the brothers of the Golden Blade ruled as kings, bringing great joy to the realm. The people thrived, and the Four Barbarians were at peace. By the xīnsì year, the lesser Six Barbarians stirred unrest, which continued through the rényǔ and guǐwèi years, growing ever more chaotic.\n\nIn the jiǎshēn year, disaster struck—a flood rising forty *zhang*. Where no water came, great armies would instead descend, with barbarian raiders pressing southward yet causing no harm. The Nine Provinces remained untroubled.\n\nAs the era of the True Lord of the Golden Blade drew to its close, the emperor relocated his court to the land of Cháng’ān, though the earth itself rejected its people. When the time came to depart, the native-born fled first, while sojourners followed after—such was the natural course of heavenly *qi*, not the will of men.\n\nWithin the Daoist gates of the Mysterious Portal, the sovereign revered and upheld the teachings, and the Daoist arts flourished. Even the Six Barbarians submitted. With the advent of the Middle Prime, a radiant king governed, and none harbored the malice of war or blade. The displaced people gradually returned to the central capital, and the realm knew peace, gathering in perfect harmony.\n\nThese events, from the *Yǒngjiā* era of the Western Jìn to the early years of the Sòng, have now come to pass.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *rényǔ* and *xīnsì* years, some saw Daoists enter the mountains, cutting off grain to fast, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists spurn worldly glory, enduring hardship in pursuit of their masters, seeking the Dao of immortality. Still others saw Daoists forsake worldly ties, single-mindedly reciting scriptures, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists remain unwed, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists devote themselves to austerities, enduring toil and suffering, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists abstain from food, offering sustenance to their masters, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists spare no expense, commissioning vast numbers of scriptures and images, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists receive numerous registers and covenants, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists abandon their wives and refuse service to kings, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists daily exhorting others, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists constructing many oratories for purification, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists serve their masters without negligence, seeking the Dao of immortality. Still others saw Daoists refrain from deliberate action, seeking the Dao of immortality.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When people practice the Dao and serve their masters, some lounge or slouch before them, show no reverence upon seeing them, and deceive their masters and fellow disciples—ten such claims hold not a single truth. Such people waste your efforts, and both heaven and men will punish them, cutting short their allotted years. Serving a master should be like a minister before the Son of Heaven—how could one dare arrogance or disrespect? Even if a master appears ordinary, they are lords of spirits and gods. If you honor them, divine beings will draw near to you. If you disrespect your master, they will not await your reverence. Yet masters are protected by immortal guardian spirits, and when these spirits grow angry, they punish men. Thus, you Daoists must exercise the utmost caution.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this time until the *xīnsì* year, red people will appear. These red people stand three *chǐ* and seven *cùn* tall, numbering three hundred million. They dwell in the waters of the Eastern Sea, and among them are Daoists who study the Way. In the Southern Sea, eight hundred thousand people stand nine *chǐ* tall, and they too will come to China to receive the Dao—though some of the time may not recognize them.\n\nThe water-dwellers reside on Crooked Mountain in the sea, with both men and women living beneath the waves. They occasionally emerge onto the Nine Bends Mountain, and many of their Daoist practitioners are exceedingly fair, unmatched anywhere in the world. Their king has three hundred consorts, all of whom receive the Daoist arts, transformed by the immortal Celestial Women of Heaven. The Three Caverns’ great scriptures have spread to the Western Sea, where people stand seventeen *chǐ* tall. They too observe the ways of husband and wife, yet their practice of the Dao differs from that of the people of China.\n\nWáng Fāngpíng and Mágū visit them daily to instruct the people. In this land, too, there are water-dwellers, standing sixteen *chǐ* tall, with many women and few men. Their king stands twenty-nine *chǐ* tall, with three thousand consorts, each bearing thirty-six princely sons. They do not eat the five grains, and celestial beings descend to the waters to craft palaces of gold, jade, and the seven treasures. Their bodies are clad in garments of gold, jade, and the seven treasures. Even if people of China were to encounter them, they would not recognize them. When they travel, they ride the wind and command the rain, possessing the natural *qi* of the Dao.\n\nThese water-dwellers live beneath the waters, though the waters flow above them. The great beasts of the sea are beyond the knowledge of worldly men, and there are also colossal horses and oxen as large as horses, with countless varieties—ten thousand kinds, not to be compared to a single thing. There is nothing like them in the world.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Among the people of the world, there are thirty-six kinds. Ninety thousand *lǐ* beyond the Eastern Sea lies the Red Moon-Branch Mountain, towering nine hundred million *zhàng* high. At its summit dwell beings with three heads sharing a single body, serpentine in form. They do not eat the five grains but feed on humans, insects, deer, birds, and beasts. Their bodies can fly.\n\nThree hundred thousand *lǐ* beyond the Southern Sea stands Bamboo Mountain, rising seven hundred thousand *zhàng* high. Within it lives a one-horned person, six *zhàng* and seven *chǐ* tall, who eats insects, birds, grasses, and trees. Their speech is unintelligible.\n\nSeventy thousand *lǐ* beyond the Western Sea, people stand five *chǐ* tall and consume stones, sand, and water. Their language is incomprehensible.\n\nFifty thousand *lǐ* beyond the Northern Sea lies another mountain, two hundred *zhàng* high. Atop it dwell people with one body and three faces, nine *chǐ* tall. They cannot eat grain but subsist on grasses and seeds. They know nothing of human affairs yet possess the *qi* of yin and yang, husband and wife. Their offspring resemble humans, yet they run as swiftly as flying birds, and tigers and wolves fear them.\n\nThe Dao speaks: These water-dwellers live for three thousand years before dying, while the wild people of the mountains live for three hundred years. They know nothing of the Dao and lack rites and propriety. Only the people of China understand rites and propriety.\n\nChina spans fourteen thousand *lǐ* from east to west and north to south, and its people know the law and study the great Dao. Celestial beings naturally come and go among them. No other lands possess this. The ten directions contain boundless realms—these are the wondrous lands, not the lesser ones. Only the sagely dwell there, and unless one is a Perfected Immortal of the Primordial Truth, none may journey to those places.\n\nThe Perfected Immortal of the Primordial Truth said: \"What land is this, and how many *lǐ* does it span? It is second only to China.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy addressed the Most High, saying: \"This is Chang’an of China. From the eastern shores to the outskirts beyond Wu and Chu in the south, from Qubing in the west to the deserts in the north—all these are encompassed within the name of China. Yet among the people of today who practice rites and the Dao, only those of the Central Plains, Wu and Chu, Shu and Han, Jianye, and Luoyang truly do so. Men and women who believe in the law find their finest exemplars in the regions of Jingchu, Jiangxia, and Nanyang’s Zhou lands. In the western lands of Congling and Liangzhou, and in the northern commanderies of Xuantu, few study the path of immortality.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"Among all the palaces under heaven, Duyang Palace is supreme, with Mount Wudang ranking second. China contains ninety myriad myriad palaces, each with seventy myriad lesser palaces, and within them dwell thirty million people. Among the forty-nine mountains, the foremost is Mount Duyang. It stretches twelve hundred *lǐ* from east to west, its slopes broad and level, a place of repose where the sun’s valleys lie two hundred *lǐ* deep. In ancient times, a Dharma Master journeyed there to propagate the Dao and its teachings, and the Three Caverns spread forth. Within a decade, those who responded—such as Feixian, Ji Chao, Du Xuanzhi, Xing Tongfa, Li Majin, Zhang Nu, and Liu Shizi—all ascended as masters. Zhongshan holds the dwellings of ancients, now called Xiangchuan. The younger son of King Hui of Zhou attained immortality, and his palace remains there. Many among its people have achieved transcendence, and later generations of Daoists who encounter this Dharma Master’s Three Caverns scriptures shall all attain flight as immortals. The men and women of this land in later ages will also produce many Daoists who meet sagely beings. Why is this so? The ancient immortal Dong Xuanke dwelled there, having long attained the Dao. He would appear to teach the people, and those who believed in the Dao were instructed by these immortals.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In later ages, three thousand Daoists will come from the sea, their brows like a hundred phoenixes. Their palaces and halls lie in the northern mountains of the Western Regions—this was the dwelling of Fuxi’s younger brother. Fuxi originally resided on Mount Qiuchi, also in the Ox Mountain of the Western Regions. Mount Nüwa is another abode of ancient sages, located in Xiangchuan, where thirty thousand immortals dwelled during the Zhou era.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"Among the mountains—Yuntai, Minxuan, Mianzhu, Chishi, Longhe, and Ningshu—ancient immortals dwell in Shu, within the city of Chengdu. In the *renwu* and *xinsi* years, the Three Caverns are supreme on Fenyang Mountain, Bamin Mountain, and the Five Upper Mountains. In Baxi’s Mount Zitong, many ancient immortals reside in its forests and grottoes. Later generations of Daoists, in every lineage, are all transformations of the Jade Immortal of the Mysterious Woman, daily guided by the Dharma Masters who travel there. Traversing the ten directions, they emerge from Mount Fu, Mount Ba, and Mount Jianping, where seven hundred thousand immortals conceal themselves.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In households that uphold the Dao, on the days of the Three Assemblies, one must not fail to visit one’s master. Whenever attending the Three Assemblies, each must present a *shi* of celestial tribute—no shortfall of even a *sheng* is permitted. If the granary officials investigate and find fault, misfortune will befall the household: livestock will die suddenly, undertakings will fail, and pestilence will spread across the land. When attending the Three Assemblies, offering three *liang* of incense is the customary practice. Whenever inviting a master, proper ritual propriety must be observed—nothing may be done in vain. In cases of grave illness, exceptions are made, but one must honor the master as a father, without negligence. Even if one departs for a single night, one must bow to the master; where the master stays, one stays.\"\n\n\"Daoists who sit at the desk to administer their duties hold no distinction of rank. When seated together for inquiry, no future misfortune remains, for the assembled spirits are not resentful. If one has received many scriptures but holds a minor position, the one with more scriptures is deemed greater. To administer major affairs without scriptural foundation is but a minor governance.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"Households that receive the Dao and uphold its laws must reverently offer celestial tribute, annually delivering it to the administration themselves. They must attend to this diligently, lest the master be displeased. The celestial beings will punish you, and even a single *dou* shortfall will not suffice. If the master reports to the celestial courts, the household head will suffer calamity and retribution for failing to honor the master. The foolishness of worldly people leads them to resent the master instead, though the master bears no fault. Every report made above will bring misfortune upon your Daoist community. The same applies to receiving the Dao and its scriptures—one must not act falsely, for even if one cannot fulfill every requirement, one must not be insincere. Many worldly people are impoverished yet unwilling to exert themselves, hoping only for empty gains. When they hear that masters impose many regulations and legal codes, none can comply, and thus they deceive both themselves and others. Daoists who aspire to the Daoist gate must rouse themselves, seek trustworthy offerings, and prepare them with a sincere heart. Only then may the master absolve them—nothing is impossible.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"From this time forward, the celestial yellow writs and contracts, along with the scriptures, shall be supreme. Those who no longer receive them will now attain the Yellow, Red, and Purple Palaces of this world. Those who refuse will be examined by the *qi* near them. Why is this so? The spread of the Three Caverns allows those afflicted by sudden illness to summon a Three Caverns Daoist for treatment. Bowing, burning incense, and invoking the incense fire will naturally disperse all troubles—no memorial is needed, for the celestial courts will comply. In the *renwu* and *xinsi* years, one must not refuse memorials for others. If one composes memorials for worldly people, the household head will be punished by death, and the master will also bear guilt. For each memorial composed, gather the living person’s words according to the matter at hand. Whether three masters, eight masters, five masters, or one master, face east in the upper chamber, present the memorial, pace the void, chant and recite, and then cease. The ghostly soldiers will naturally disperse and rest. Offerings of cakes, fruits, and fine foods must accompany the memorial. From now on, after presenting a memorial, bow twice upon completing the rites.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"When one receives registers, talismans, or contracts, from the rank of general upward, all must be provided for. One must present pledges and tokens according to the law—no leniency is permitted.\"\n\nThe Yellow Writ of Heaven is to be consumed by eight persons. When conducting rites at the Capital of Scriptures, twelve practitioners are required, each partaking of this as the constant norm. Worldly people, unaware, often perform rites to no avail. When Daoists perform blessings, the sun and moon oversee them—fasting and lecturing take precedence, with reverence for the master held in the heart. Should one act improperly even for a day, showing disrespect to the master, the master’s neglect will not endure past the first day of the month. On the fifteenth day, when paying homage to the scriptures, one must bow to the ten directions and also to the master. To take even one false step incurs thirty-six trials per step, with each sin consigning one to the Inexhaustible Hell, from which escape is impossible, and ascension to the Dao forever forfeit.\n\nThe Dao states: \"From now on, in the years *xinsi* and *renwu*, the Three Caverns shall spread and disseminate throughout the world. The people of the world shall no longer submit memorials. Many men and women will uphold the scriptures and enter the mountains, with women often receiving the teachings—transformed by heavenly maidens. After the passing of *jiashen*, the Dao’s *qi* will flourish, the Six Barbarians will submit in faith, and all immortals will share the same dharma as one family. From the year *renwu* onward, Daoists shall don the three ritual garments: the cap, brown robe, skirt, mantle, staff, and sandals. They shall eat once daily, fasting past noon, abstaining from all meat and wine, and never tasting them. They shall instruct the laity, ensuring no transgressions of the law. Men and women may transmit the teachings, with the wise serving as masters. They shall not raise livestock, for the proper cultivation of life pertains to the self alone. The study of scriptures is their vocation. Those who enter the mountains shall observe monthly fasts, subsisting on vegetables alone. When ten, thirty, or a hundred enter the mountains together, they shall cultivate fields extensively, plant gardens, grow the five vegetables, and construct dwellings on all sides, along with fasting halls and pavilions. No one, two, or three shall dwell alone. Ghosts and spirits deceive the solitary—scriptural dharma cannot be practiced in isolation. In fasting halls with many people, three fasts shall be held monthly, and incense offered thrice daily to bow to the ten directions. Thus do the gods draw near to humanity. If one or two dwell alone in the mountains without establishing rites or building fasting halls, they are no different from beasts or deer in the wild. What distinction is there? One must follow an enlightened master, one rich in skills and scriptural knowledge, for the ascent of even one is auspicious—how much more so for many. Thus, fewer than ten should not reside together, let alone two or five. Such people do not submit to the mountain spirits; the mountain spirits deceive them, and they shall know no fortune.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"When one receives the Yellow Writ and scriptures, they endure long. If one does not follow the master’s transmission, trials will come daily. Illness will afflict them, silkworms and fields will wither, households will suffer misfortune, lifespans will not reach their term, and they will die prematurely. Moreover, one cannot return the master’s talismans and contracts, for the spirits have already entered the body’s organs, causing illness. If one follows the dharma and is transmitted by three masters, no harm shall befall. For Daoists, the mastery of scriptures is paramount—the foundation of ascension to immortality. Thus, among all masters, the scripture master is supreme. Immortals and jade maidens all revere the scripture master. Talismans and contracts are foremost. A Daoist who does not receive all talismans and contracts is no Daoist. One who does not uphold the Three Caverns is no Daoist. To receive only the inner and outer Yellow, Red, and Purple Registers is to be but a minor Daoist. One must receive the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*, the upper talismans, and all related matters to attain the rank of upper immortal.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"When Daoists enter the mountains, they shall honor their masters as they would in the world. If a master dies, they shall visit the grave, bury them with rites, and dress them with proper garments and sashes. They shall weep for seven days and then hold a fast. The fast shall be observed once every seven days for three weeks, then cease. If a disciple dies, the master shall likewise attend to them according to the dharma, without slaughtering animals for offerings—seasonal cakes and fruits suffice. For later generations of Daoists, follow the scriptures in all matters. Those who do not shall become heavenly beings, never to die. All other possessions may be given away.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In later ages, those who master the Three Caverns and encounter this *Scripture of Flying Immortals* shall behold the image of the Most High Lord. Those unable to enter the mountains may instead dwell in distant forests or hills, far from worldly people—ten or five *li* apart. They shall plant abundant vegetable gardens, orchards, and fields. Monthly fasts shall be observed without fail, converting and instructing the foolish to uphold the Three Treasures. Masters, regardless of rank, are honored as noble. Formerly, Luo He, at ninety-eight years, bowed thrice daily to his sixteen-year-old master, attending him with reverence and never showing disrespect. Worldly people, seeing this, sighed: ‘This old man, his temples graying, bows to this young boy!’ Yet the heavenly beings and jade maidens said: ‘This is the elder’s master from a past life. Though young, his wisdom runs deep.’\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"The bond between master and disciple is a profound connection from past lives, akin to that of father and son. All are drawn together from former existences, having sworn oaths across kalpas—this intimacy is not merely of the present. Those bound by evil karma are likewise entangled. If rulers, great ministers, governors, or officials of two thousand bushels now study immortality with these Daoists, it is due to good karma from past lives. Without such deep connections, they could not become masters, disciples, or spiritual kin. Today’s wisdom, love of scriptures, and devotion to study all stem from long practice in past lives. The master-disciple bond is the same, forged over countless ages. They swore to be master and friend, and upon encountering this scripture, now receive it. Those who receive it wisely do so because they studied it in past lives. Though unaware of worldly affairs, they are called wise—this is clear, for their devotion has endured long.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In later ages, epidemics and ghostly soldiers will multiply, slaying people.\"\n\nThe Daoist may instruct people to observe fasts on the eight seasonal days, with an entire village participating together—doing abundant good. These are: the days of *Lichun*, *Chunfen*, *Lixia*, *Xiazhi*, *Liqiu*, *Qiufen*, *Lidong*, and *Dongzhi*, as well as the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months—these are the great fast days. On these days, the Daoist conducts the fast according to the grand ritual. For those studying the Dao of immortality, reciting scriptures and performing the Daoist rites for three days and three nights brings boundless merit. In the Daoist method, unless they are master and disciple, the elder is called \"elder brother\" and the younger \"younger brother\"; they may not be addressed as □ or servant. Ghosts kill people—Daoists must be cautious of this.\n\nThose who wish to observe the eight seasonal fasts should choose a place by wild waters, on an island or islet, a pure and secluded site—this is the first offering to the *Xun* direction. The Dao states: \"From the *Renwu* year onward, memorials were submitted again, but the worldly *huangshu* contracts and decrees were no longer received; what the Heavenly Maidens received came without gate or barrier. From now until the *Guiwei* year, after *Jiashen* has passed, the *huangshu* contracts and decrees will no longer be consulted; only this world’s *huangshu* will remain. Those who formally receive the worldly *huangshu* will not ascend as immortals. If men or women have not previously held immortal registers, they may receive the *huangshu* contracts and decrees of the heavens by obtaining at least ten divine youths and one general. If three masters or even one master initiates them, they too become great Daoists and may receive the scriptures and contracts. The people of the world, unaware of the approaching great flood, refuse to accept the Dao—when the time of great disaster comes, they will suddenly perish. Alas, what can be done? If they cannot receive many texts, receiving the *Five Thousand Character Scripture* or the *Scripture of Transforming the Barbarians* is also good.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"From now until the *Renwu* and *Xinsi* years, there will be many women Daoists who receive the Three Caverns. Those entering the mountains will also be mostly female Daoists, while men will be few. The Mysterious Woman often descends, transforming into a young girl to receive disciples in the world. After *Jiashen*, all men and women aged thirteen and above will receive the ten generals, divine youths, and the heavenly *huangshu* contracts and decrees. Why? Because the world will increasingly believe in the Dao.\"\n\nMagu, Du Lanxiang, An Qisheng, and Tang Gongfang—all these transformed beings—have each received Daoist teachings, with every school possessing them. Scriptures are supreme, and rituals and lectures abound day and night. In the lands east of the Yangtze, Wu and Chu, as well as in the Shu commanderies of Han and Qin, many practice the Dao.\n\nThe Dao states: \"As the Three Caverns emerge into the world, immortals descend daily. Daoist men and women must diligently study scriptures and contracts, receive many talismans and registers, wholeheartedly believe in goodness, contemplate their masters’ virtues, and make offerings to Daoists. Daoists know no rank—when summoned to dispel misfortune, incense and fire must not be neglected even for a single day. Daoists have their own officers and soldiers for protection, and these must not be disobeyed even for a moment. The officers and soldiers report human transgressions, and heavenly envoys punish those who defy them. At night, the officers within one’s body depart and execute judgment upon the person, causing illness. Prolonged affliction weakens the body. All manner of inauspicious dreams are the work of these officers.\n\nOnce, a female official was summoned to dispel misfortune. She deceived the petitioner, saying, 'Today, the officers within me are in conflict; I cannot perform the rite or dispel your misfortune.' For this deception, two months later, the female official began to hemorrhage and suffered for three years without recovery. A diviner declared, 'You bear a great sin; the heavenly courts are punishing you.' The female official reflected and realized this must be the consequence of her deception. She invited Daoists to perform rituals and repented for a month before recovering.\n\nThe Dao states: 'From now on, admonish future generations: when you receive the Dao, husband and wife must do so together; neither may receive alone. When receiving the *Yellow Writs*, the Three Masters must transmit them, and the Dao must confer the *Yellow Contracts*. Those who fail this will suffer bodily punishment and will not regain human form in future lives—how much less attain immortality? Deceiving others is also forbidden. Those who follow the Dao but neglect incense and fire will surely face punishment, which will extend to their descendants.'\n\nOnce, two neighboring households both received the *Great Contracts of the Yellow Writs* for inner and outer realms. One household had the Three Masters transmit the teachings, practiced the Dao daily, and had Daoists dispel misfortune. Every matter proceeded favorably, never against their wishes. Husband and wife ascended as immortals, protected by heavenly beings. The other household, though they received the teachings, did not undergo transmission by the Three Masters. They copied texts themselves and ceased practicing the Dao. They did not live out their allotted years, and within two years, their entire clan was destroyed—heavenly beings executed them. Those who receive the Dao must follow every word of the scriptures.\n\nThe Dao states: 'People of the world are often foolish. When husband and wife together follow the Dao, jealousy disrupts their practice, preventing them from cultivating the Way. The qi of the Dao and its officers and soldiers grow angry. After death, they enter the *Fire Cart* and *Eight Winds* hells, where they die and are reborn three times a day for seventy thousand kalpas, never regaining human form. Even if they are reborn as humans, they will have human shape but lack human nature—deaf, mute, covered in sores, convulsing, hideous in appearance, their bodies foul and odorous. Others shun them. Daoists, with compassionate hearts, transform people to avoid such corruption. Daoists wear hempen robes and eat plain food, transcribe scriptures, study diligently, and serve their masters. Teach future generations—male and female Daoists—reflect deeply on this.'\n\nThe Dao states: 'The Dao’s teachings are hard to encounter; few do so. Those who encounter them in later ages must revere and uphold them, sparing no wealth. Daoists, as teachers to others, should not greedily take people’s property. Daoists who wish to wear talismans and aspire to immortality must not be stingy. They should forsake wives and children, and not covet livestock or horses. In the past, there were those who gave away wives and children or sold them to receive scriptures—more than one such person. From ancient times to now, only one or two have truly believed in the Dao.'\n\nThe Dao states: 'The *Great Scriptures of the Three Caverns* are the highest of scriptures, yet they do not surpass the *Scripture of Flying Immortals*. Why? The *Scripture of Flying Immortals* was expounded by the Supreme of the Ten Directions’ Great Dao and all immortals and jade maidens who roam and transform the world. It is guarded by countless divine beings, soldiers, and horses. Those who receive it are protected by immortals, and nothing is inauspicious. In the *Xinsi* and *Renwu* years to come, this scripture will spread throughout the world. People will lecture and recite it more than other scriptures. Daoists, through fasting and abstinence, will widely transmit this scripture, for it enables one to become a flying immortal. The Three Caverns allow for many paths—corpse-liberation immortals and earthbound immortals—but this scripture has only flying immortals. This scripture, in twenty scrolls, is revered by heavenly beings, jade maidens, and immortals of the ten directions.'\n\nThe Dao states: 'From now until the *Renwu* and *Xinsi* years, Daoists must urgently convert the world to receive the Dao. Great disasters are imminent; heaven will release epidemic qi, and pestilence will spread, killing many wicked people. Those who perform meritorious deeds will be spared by ghostly soldiers. When the time of the water disaster arrives in those years, Daoists should urge people to build shelters, receive and uphold the true scriptures of the Three Caverns. With the scriptures and contracts upon them, the officers and divine warriors will naturally ward off evil. The waters will come soon, in the *Jiashen* year. If not then, there will be disasters of blades and warfare, and the people will be in turmoil. After the *Jiashen* year, the great flood will sweep everything away. At that time, heaven and earth will be renewed—this world will be no more.\n\nThe Dao states: 'The world is full of wicked people, so the Three Caverns are not widely disseminated. Sentient beings are pitiable, flowing with the mud, and ghostly soldiers execute them. Alas, what can be done? For three days and nights, the Supreme and Wen Shi remained in the Mysterious Capital, contemplating how to deliver sentient beings from life and death. They entered the Golden Casket and retrieved the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Void* and the *Scripture of Flying Immortals* in twenty scrolls, entrusting them to the Grand Dharma Master to transmit to the people of the world.'\"\n\nThe Dao states: From this *Renwu* and *Xinsi* year onward, Daoist priests will frequently encounter these *Scriptures of Flying Immortals* and *Scriptures of the Great Void*. Shen Zhi of Shangdang, surnamed Chuwen, shall obtain these scriptures and ascend as an immortal of the highest rank. Among women, two hundred sixty thousand shall receive these scriptures and enter the mountains.\n\nThe Dao states: From this time forth, if one encounters such a master who imparts these scriptures, the flying immortals of the ten directions, the immortals of the Five Sacred Peaks, the Jade Maidens, the Boundless Venerable Ones, and all the Mysterious Women shall come together to protect those who receive the scriptures. Wherever this Dharma Master resides, the world shall be in great harmony, the five grains shall flourish, the people shall live in peace and joy, the emperor shall enjoy long life, and heavenly beings shall descend daily to instruct and assist the ruler in governing the realm.\n\nThe Dao states: Such are the merits of the Daoist priest. If the ruler, great ministers, regional lords, or officials of the two thousand *shi* ranks also uphold and receive these teachings, their positions shall be boundless, and heavenly beings shall naturally guard and protect them. Until the end of their days, they shall be kept from evil.\n\nAll those present who heard the Most High expound this scripture were overjoyed, each receiving the transformation. They bowed their heads in reverence, paid homage, and took refuge in the Three Treasures.\n\nHere ends the twentieth scroll of the *Most High Scripture of the Abyssal Divine Incantations*.",

      "translated_text": "By the third night, a radiance bright as daylight filled the courtyard, and auspicious winds with scenic clouds suffused the heavens. Suddenly, celestial fragrance and heavenly music descended into the courtyard, where over three thousand armored warriors, armed with golden armor and sharp weapons, arrayed themselves as if awaiting command. In but a moment, pearl-encrusted canopies and jeweled banners, rainbow streamers and crimson standards, red flags and embroidered pennants advanced in pairs to receive them, while white cranes soared in flight and vermilion phoenixes danced in unison. Two azure-clad attendants bore flowers and incense, and four jade maidens held aloft a jade table. The earth unfolded into brocade mats, a great screen stood before them, and on either side stood Dragon and Tiger Generals with over twenty attendants and officials, as if in solemn guard. Beyond the Dragon and Tiger Lords, dozens of golden-armored generals and great divine kings arrayed themselves in orderly ranks.\n\nPresently, pipes and flutes resounded through the sky, descending from the northwest, while five-colored lights blazed with dazzling brilliance. One bearing a tablet and girded with a sword stepped forward and announced to Zuan: \"The Supreme Dao Lord has arrived.\" Then a throne of a hundred treasures descended from the void, and there appeared the Dao Lord seated upon a five-colored flying dragon and lotus throne, hovering over ten feet above the ground, attended by two Perfected Ones and two Celestial Masters. Zuan bowed deeply, advancing with reverent steps to receive him.\n\nThe Dao Lord said: \"You have pitied the people, expressing it in your memorials, carving out your heart and weeping tears that have moved both the seen and unseen realms. The earthly officials have reported this, and I have taken note of you.\" Zuan prostrated himself in gratitude.\n\nThe Dao Lord continued: \"The interplay of yin and yang nurtures the myriad things, endowing them with the five phases for their use. Yet the five phases overcome one another, and all things wax and wane, ceaselessly succeeding one another without pause. Thus life begets life without end, qi follows qi in unbroken succession, and since kalpas immemorial, this has never once ceased. Those who attain life harmonize with pure yang, ascending to heaven as immortals. Those who meet death sink into utmost yin, becoming ghosts upon the earth. Among ghostly beings, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority, strength and weakness, firmness and softness, good and evil—no different from the world of men.\n\nThe Jade Emperor, fearing the wantonness of ghosts and spirits bringing calamity upon humanity, has commanded the Five Emperors and the Three Officials to enforce the laws and decrees that restrain and govern them, with punishments and statutes fully established. Yet in this degenerate age, deceitful people abound, the wellspring of purity has scattered, and malevolent qi sprouts forth. They are disloyal to their lords, unfilial to their parents, violating the teachings of the Three Bonds and Five Constants, casting themselves into death’s embrace. Thus the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens’ old qi, along with the defeated armies and dead generals of past ages, band together to harm the living, riding the winds and rains, seizing upon weakness and opportunity to spread manifold diseases, inflicting grievous harm. Many do not live out their allotted years, cut down in untimely deaths.\n\nLong ago in the Du Yang Palace, I revealed the *Divine Incantations Scripture* and entrusted it to the Perfected One Tang Ping, bidding him disseminate it to save humanity. Yet the ignorant and foolish of the world, seeing names like Wang Jian and Bai Qi, dismiss it as mere fabrication. These were once generals in life, leading armies in death as ghostly commanders. Those who accumulated merit were promoted to yin officials, while the cruel and violent remained bound to demonic ranks, riding the败 qi of the five phases to bring plague and pestilence. Yet they fear the might of yang and are subdued by divine incantations, which shall surely eradicate them.\n\nNow I bestow upon you the transformed scripture of divine incantations. Follow and practice it to protect and shelter the myriad people.\" Thereupon, he commanded an attendant to open the ninefold radiance and present the scripture along with the secrets of the Three and Five Great Fasts, saying: \"Strive to practice these hidden merits, and you may hope to fulfill the ranks of immortality.\" With these words, the Dao Lord and his retinue of Perfected Ones ascended toward the northwest.\n\nZuan then followed the scripture’s teachings and fasts, practicing them throughout the Jiangnan region. The people thrived in peace, and pestilence was dispelled. From the Jin dynasty to the present, those who have received its blessings are beyond count. This depends on purity, reverence, utmost sincerity, and diligence—clarity and sincerity evoke response as surely as echo answers sound. Should one grow lax, careless, or recklessly divulge these teachings, one will incur fault and guilt. Those who cultivate and uphold these practices must heed this warning.\n\nMoreover, this scripture is vast and profound, proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Primordial Emperor himself, its principles deep and abstruse. The Supreme’s subtle words and secret instructions, if recited with a devoted heart and unwavering intent, will kindle incense and summon the true spirits in an instant. Divine soldiers and celestial officers will sweep away evil like lightning, while fierce steeds and heavenly escorts will dispel pestilential miasmas wherever they go. Now, seeking skilled hands once more, we reopen this auspicious cause, exhausting the art of carving and the subtlety of ink, hoping its practice will not fade and its dissemination will know no bounds. May the imperial reign endure and surpass the Zhou’s divination, may the emperor’s years stretch far and exceed Yao’s longevity. May the realm’s chariots unite under one sky, its calendar extend to all lands. Praise the power and virtue of the Great Dao, aiding the imperial court’s benevolent nurturing. Boundless are the vast blessings and mysterious grace!\n\n*The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Scripture*, Scroll One\n*The Vow Against Demons* Chapter\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"Long ago, above the Three Heavens, I expounded the immeasurable scriptures to all men and women, teaching and transforming all beings. At that time, the Perfected One Wei Mingluo and four hundred ninety thousand heavenly hosts from the lower worlds arrived above the Three Heavens to hear the immeasurable great scriptures, bringing peace within and without. Mingluo and the others arose, bowing thrice to the Supreme, and inquired: 'Is the teaching and transformation of the Heavenly Worthy difficult?' They humbly expressed their sentiments.\n\nThe Supreme said: 'Have you come from Jambudvīpa?'\nMingluo and the others replied: 'Yes.'\nThe Supreme said: 'Among the people of the world, are there any who follow the Dao, uphold the scriptures, and study immortality?'\nMingluo and the others said: 'The people of the world accumulate evil and do not believe in the Dao or its methods.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Amidst these sounds, only the wails of mourning corpses are heard, never the melodies of immortals’ songs. The people are filthy and defiled, the Three Caverns blocked and obstructed. The calamities of the hundred and six disasters—blades, warfare, epidemics, and sickness—rage unchecked. Demon kings unleash their poisons, slaughtering the good and virtuous. Every household suffers misfortune, and cries of sorrow follow one after another. Beings devour one another, inflicting suffering upon themselves. Drawn into death together, they cling to ignorance and endure torment, utterly unaware of escape. How can such people be delivered?\n\nUpon hearing Mingluo and the others speak thus, the Supreme addressed the assembled gods and humans: “What do beings ponder? They know not the Dao or its methods, nor do they understand what they endure. They commit evil of their own accord, then slander one another. The Three Caverns’ teachings circulate widely, yet none receive and uphold them—like blind men wandering beneath the sun and moon. Are the sun and moon not bright? The blind cannot see. Though Dharma masters proclaim and transform, fools remain unmoved.”\n\nThen the Supreme, leading eighty million billion heavenly beings and jade maidens, descended to save them, passing through Jade Capital. Atop Jade Capital Mountain stood a peach tree, its height spanning three hundred ninety billion miles. Its eastern branch sheltered the eastern lands, its southern branch covered the southern realms, its western branch shaded the west, and its northern branch blanketed the north. Once every forty-nine billion years it bloomed, and once every eighty billion years it bore a single fruit. When ripe, the fruit was as large as a cartwheel; one who ate of it would hunger no more for three thousand years. Ghosts who beheld this peach tree would perish of their own accord. Each heavenly being took up a branch of this peach wood and descended to slay the plague ghosts, and all manner of auspicious signs arose.\n\nThe Dao declared: “From the years *xinsi* and *renwu* onward, ghostly soldiers have run rampant, and demon kings have spread their poisons, afflicting the people with toxic illnesses. I now dispatch forty-nine billion enforcers to seize the thirty-six heavenly demon kings and bring them down to swear an oath: ‘From this day forward, if the people of any land suffer unjust deaths, sudden illnesses, imprisonment, or bondage, it is because these demon kings have failed to restrain their underlings, allowing them to harm the seed of the people. Henceforth, by the golden decree of the Supreme, any who disobey shall cause the people of their lands to suffer epidemics, warfare, hardship, imprisonment, bondage, and deaths without reason. This will be the fault of the demon kings who first failed to restrain their underlings—thus they shall be slain without mercy.’”\n\nThereupon, the Supreme sent forth forty-nine myriad officials from the ten directions, along with thirty million heavenly maidens and the Great Brahmā King, to summon the thirty-six heavenly demon kings and eighty billion myriad lesser ghost kings, together with their wives, children, and retinues, to swear a solemn oath. The Queen Consorts of the Dark Maiden and Māhādevī, numbering thirty-six myriad, all came as well to assist the Supreme in reprimanding the demon kings. The demon kings prostrated themselves and each dispatched their demonic sons and warrior attendants to patrol the borders of the lands, protecting the people within, lest the Supreme execute them.\n\nThe Brahmā Sons of the Nine Heavens, the great demon kings, their kings and consorts, and their multicolored maidens all bowed thrice and submitted to the Supreme’s teachings.\n\nThe Dao declared: “From the time of Fuxi until the end of the Han, the people lived in great joy, yet most did not believe in the Dao. They all received the natural *qi* of heaven’s demonic influences, unaware of the Dao, unaware of the Dharma, unaware of the scriptures, serving only the natural order. Later, those who believed in the scriptures were few indeed. In the era of the Great Jin, as the world approached its end, the people lacked purity. Lineages arose to govern the people of the world, first enduring much suffering—oppressed from above and below—before gradually flourishing. Their prosperity lay in the lands east of the Yangzi, where heaven and humanity converged, and the *qi* of the Dao flourished.\n\nThe kalpa’s end draws near, yet within it, some will attain the Three Treasures, the immeasurable *Shangqing*, the *Huangting* records of immortality, the *Taisu*, and the *Lingbao* samādhi. These people all possess great blessings from past lives, their fortune flowing into future incarnations. Upon hearing and seeing these scriptures, they will escape the calamities of the Three Rivers’ great floods.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! You men and women—whether kings, emperors, lords, governors of two thousand households, or even the lowliest, including slaves and servants—if you can attain these scriptures and receive these covenants and registers, your names will enter the ranks of immortals, and you shall never suffer unjust deaths.”\n\nIn the Palace of Mystic Radiance, the Supreme expounded this divine incantation scripture. Eight hundred million myriad of the Nine Heavens’ great demons, rākṣasas, ghostly bandits, and the retinues of all the heavens gathered in attendance, listening to the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse. Each clasped their hands and prostrated themselves upon the ground. The Heavenly Worthy then expounded the great scripture of immortal records, and all who heard it felt their bodies undergo wondrous transformations.\n\nThe Dao declared: “Listen carefully, for I shall now speak to you of the kalpa’s end in the ages to come. Three thousand years after Fuxi, great floods overflowed, and half the people perished. For thirty-six years, the myriad clans rebelled, slaughtering one another. By the time of the Zhou and Qin’s fall, the people were nearly annihilated. By the end of the Han and Wei, the people were displaced, and half died. When the Liu clan’s fifth-generation descendants inherited their ancestors’ legacy, the four directions cried out in distress, the world teetered on the brink of ruin, and the people could not dwell in peace. Driven and oppressed by the Six Barbarians, they fled to the lands east of the Yangzi, while the gentry concealed their traces, also taking refuge along the Huai and the sea. In the year *jiawu*, the people returned to dwell in the Central Kingdom. Chang’an flourished, the Qin Plain rejoiced, the Six Barbarians submitted as vassals, and all dwelt in the mountains and marshes, not within the central plains. The Dao’s teachings prospered.\n\nYet the *Wooden Son with Bow Mouth* shall rise again.”\n\nThe Dao declared: “As the great kalpa nears its end, the ruling kings fail to govern, and the people sigh in despair. Winds and rains come untimely, the five grains do not ripen, and the hearts of the people turn wicked, rebelling and defying authority. Fathers and sons, brothers and kin plot against one another, leading to annihilation. Grievances and banditry spread, slaughtering the innocent. In such an age, epidemic *qi* abounds, and ninety kinds of illness afflict the world, killing the wicked. Among them is the Red-Headed Slayer Ghost, a ghost king a myriad leagues tall, leading thirty-six billion slayer ghosts.”",

These ghosts carry such *qi* and spread it across the world, slaying the foolish. Only Daoist masters and dharma teachers who receive this divine incantation sutra are attended by ninety billion myriad great spirits, spontaneous warriors, celestial beings, and jade maidens, all coming to guard and protect. Those who uphold and venerate it will see all illnesses vanish and never suffer an untimely death. Should neighboring states send great bandits to invade, recite this sutra, and the bandits will retreat of their own accord.\n\nAs the men and women present heard the Most High expound this sutra, each rose in alarm and performed the threefold bow. The disciples then declared their wish to receive this sutra.\n\nThe Dao declared: “As the kalpa’s end draws near, the people grow ever more wicked. Yet among them, those who believe in the Dao and uphold the sutras are all celestial beings, not foolish worldly folk. The Great Sage, seeing the world’s corruption and chaos, dispatched celestial beings to descend and be born in the Middle Kingdom, aiding the times and transforming through teaching. Among the Son of Heaven’s ministers, dukes, governors, and military officers—even those of lowly station—if they wholeheartedly believe in the Dao, heed the sutra, and put it into practice, immortals will guide them. But those who hear this sutra and refuse to receive and uphold it—know that such people have come from the six kinds of livestock and share no karmic affinity with the sutra. Thus, when the great flood comes, they will be devoured by fish and turtles, swept away with the mud, and none will escape.”\n\nThe Dao declared: “From this day forth, whether man or woman, if one hears and receives this sutra—regardless of status, be they slave or free, public or private—those who copy, uphold, and venerate its scrolls will gain blessings in every life, rise in rank day by day, recover from illness, and see all wishes fulfilled. For those who uphold this sutra, the Great Demons of the Three Heavens, the Great Demons of the Nine Heavens, the thirty-six generations of demons, and the ten directions’ slayer ghosts—along with their kings, wives, children, and retinues—all swear a dark oath. The Queen of the Dark Maidens, the Lady of the Hemp Maiden, and thirty-six million royal consorts unite to serve as the Most High’s Demon-Subduing King. The demon kings all submit, each dispatching their demon offspring and warrior attendants to patrol the borders, shielding the people within the realm, fearing the Most High’s punishment. The Brahma Sons of the Nine Heavens, the Great Demon Kings of the Celestial Beings, their kings, consorts, and maidens—all perform the threefold bow and obey the Most High’s teachings.”\n\nThe Dao declared: “From Fuxi’s time to the end of the Han, the people lived in great joy, yet most did not believe in the Dao. They all received the spontaneous demonic *qi* of Heaven, unaware of the Dao, unaware of the dharma, unaware of the sutras, serving only the spontaneous. Later, those who believed in the sutras were few indeed. In the Great Jin’s era, as the world neared its end, the people lacked purity. Yet from the imperial line, a successor arose to govern the world’s people. At first, they endured much suffering—oppression from above, urgency from below—before gradually flourishing. Their prosperity lay in the lands east of the Yangtze, where celestial and mortal realms converged, and the *qi* of the Dao flourished. As the celestial kalpa’s end approaches, some will attain the Three Treasures, the immeasurable Upper Clarity, the *Huangting* Records of Immortals, the *Taisu* Scripture, and the *Lingbao* Samadhi. Such people all possess great blessings from past lives, their fortune flowing into future incarnations. Hearing this sutra, they will escape the calamity of the Three Rivers’ great flood.\n\n“Excellent indeed! Whether you are men or women—kings, emperors, regional lords, or governors of two thousand households; even the foolish, regardless of slaves—if you encounter this sutra, receive this covenant and register, your names will enter the ranks of immortals, and you will never suffer an unjust death.”\n\nThe Most High, in the Palace of Mystic Radiance, expounded this divine incantation sutra.

In future generations, should men or women receive this sutra and honor their masters, they too shall attain immortality.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The fifth-generation descendant, Liu Zi, shall assist in governing the realm, continuing the lineage of immortals.

If you trust my words, the nine-dragon chariot shall come to welcome you.

Honor them, practice them, and maintain them in all actions. The myriad illnesses within your bodies shall heal of themselves.

The True Lord is not far—when the disaster of the *jiashen* year arises, great chaos shall engulf the world. The world shall be swept clean, and heaven and earth shall be reborn. Then the True Lord shall appear.\n\nWhen the True Lord comes, sages, immortals, and all who have received this sutra shall gather to assist. Daoists from the east, west, south, and north shall serve as aides, and none shall be fools.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Dispatching Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao spoke: While I resided in the Ninefold Palace of Mystic Capital, expounding the *Supreme Clarity Middle Mystery Sutra* to the great assembly, there arrived from the lower worlds the World-Transcending Divine Marshal, the Perceptive Knowledge-Sentence Lord’s Disciple, and eighty thousand perfected ones. Together they prostrated, bowing thrice before the Heavenly Worthy, and declared: “The people of the world are wicked, disbelieving in the utmost words. Though the Three Caverns’ scriptures have now emerged, none know to receive them. Plague ghosts and blade-wielding soldiers slaughter sentient beings, and when all beings perish, none seek deliverance. We disciples constantly witness this, and the suffering is unbearable to hear. In the lands today, those who govern are but walking corpses, devoid of those who embody the Dao and virtue. Lords and ministers slaughter one another; fathers and sons punish each other. When Daoists practice the Dao, fools mock them ceaselessly. They drag themselves into evil, neglecting the immortal ranks. The great kalpa draws near, yet they remain unaware. Pestilential qi and malignant epidemics will slaughter nearly all. Unable to endure this sight, we have come to earnestly implore.”\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy raised His gaze to heaven and sighed deeply: “Alas! Sentient beings fail to grasp the great purpose, neglecting to cultivate their minds, thus inviting calamity and the ravages of plague. I shall now dispatch eight hundred million celestial marshals and celestial infantry, eight hundred million celestial cavalry, four hundred thousand celestial censors, four hundred thousand celestial executioners, and forty-nine thousand celestial garrison guards to expel these ghosts for humanity. You shall carry this *Divine Incantation Sutra* and propagate it throughout the lands. Wherever people receive this sutra, plague ghosts will depart of their own accord.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From the years *gengchen*, *xinsi*, *renwu*, and *guiwei*, nearing the *jiashen* year, the world will suffer ninety-two kinds of epidemics, slaying the wicked. Without those who embody the Dao, none shall escape this plague. These epidemics will cause alternating chills and fever, headaches and dizziness, disharmony of the five viscera, piercing pain in the heart, nasal congestion, sore throat, coughing, abdominal distension, qi stabbing the heart, cramping of hands and feet, pain piercing the chest and back to the brain, deafness, jaundice, paralysis and swelling, red and black discoloration of the body, and five types of dysentery. There will also be cholera with vomiting of blood, nosebleeds, suppurating sores, shattering pain in the limbs, aching joints, feverish qi driving one to frenzy, sorrowful and disoriented thoughts, sleeplessness at midnight, tossing and turning, incoherent speech, hallucinations of gods and ghosts, swelling of the genitals and lower abdomen, paralysis of hands and feet, and sudden death with loss of consciousness. All such afflictions are the work of plague ghosts come to slay the wicked. If you uphold the teachings of the Three Caverns’ scriptures, I shall command celestial marshals to drive away these ghosts and spare you distress. The deluge is not far off—hasten, all you sentient beings, to cultivate good hearts, receive and transmit the scriptures, and only then shall you escape the great calamity.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, if there are Daoists whose hearts covet the immortal Dao, who seek no worldly glory, who devote themselves entirely to the teachings, who savor the Three Caverns’ scriptures, who follow their masters into the mountains, and who teach and transform others—such people shall have forty-nine billion celestial marshals and infantry dispatched to accompany and protect them. Wherever they go, ten thousand ghosts shall not oppose them. I now command the demon kings: from this day forward, strive for sentient beings and expel all plague ghosts.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “The *jiashen* year approaches, and the great flood is not far off. Plague ghosts now slaughter people, for the world is rife with evil and scarce in goodness. Sentient beings do not recognize the true words; though the Three Caverns’ scriptures have long been propagated, none seek to receive them, thus bringing suffering upon themselves. What more can be done? Sentient beings are pitiable. I shall now dispatch the eight divisions of celestial censors to drive away and slay plague ghosts, banishing them so that Daoists may transform people and lead them to uphold the Three Caverns’ teachings.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, those who receive and uphold this *Divine Incantation Sutra* shall have thirty thousand celestial generals with dark blades covering their bodies. You need only teach and transform all foolish people daily. Fools cling to delusion and mock those who practice goodness—heaven shall dispatch plague ghosts to drive away and slay such people. Their souls shall all enter the three evil destinies, with no hope of escape.”\n\nThe Dao of old said: “In the *xinsi* and *renwu* years, eighty million great ghosts shall come to annihilate the wicked. Those who slander the Dao and its teachings with double tongues, who utter the names of masters, who criticize the scriptures, who disbelieve in the Three Caverns, and who refuse to receive the Dao—such people shall be destroyed by the great ghost kings.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, where Daoists submit to the Three Caverns’ teachings and practice the Dao to save people, I shall dispatch ninety trillion celestial soldiers from the Nine Heavens to descend at once and protect you. If a single ghost remains, the marshals of the ten directions shall come to seize it.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, where Daoists transmit this sutra, heaven shall command four hundred ninety thousand marshals of the Three Caverns, eight hundred thousand marshals of the Six Heavens, and ninety billion celestial soldiers from the Thirty-Six Heavens to descend together and slay these plague ghosts. Those among the living who are afflicted with illness or entangled in official matters shall swiftly gain liberation, their ailments lightened and cured, their myriad spirits harmonized, and their families filled with joy. Domestic and external altars and stoves shall all be settled, sparing the living from unjust harassment. All ghosts not of ancestral worship shall be exorcised, banished forever to distant lands. If any ghost disobeys My command and refuses to depart, the demon kings shall each be beheaded without mercy. Beware, for the sage does not speak idly.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “This *Divine Incantation Sutra* names thirty-six celestial demon kings and seventy trillion lesser kings. Where Daoists transmit this sutra, the thirty-six celestial demon kings and the seventy-two lesser kings, including the Perceptive Knowledge-Sentence Lord’s Disciple, shall all submit. Thus, those who, at the end of the kalpa, receive and enshrine this *Divine Incantation Sutra* in their homes shall have all evil ghosts barred from reckless approach.”",

Heavenly beings, jade maidens, and immortals—hundreds of millions in number—also come to protect it, so that no ghostly soldiers dare approach recklessly.\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, wherever this sutra is transmitted, if any evil ghosts or malevolent spirits dare harbor ill intent toward the living or the Dharma masters, the ghost kings and the eight hundred million great demon kings shall swear to suffer the Three Beheadings, their heads shattered into thirty thousand pieces.”\n\nThe demon kings declared: “From this day forward, if Daoists heal the sick, transmit the sutras, or perform meritorious deeds, we shall ensure their every endeavor succeeds, their every wish fulfilled, with no desire left unanswered. Should we violate this oath, we, your disciples—including the Sentence Lord’s Disciple—shall each suffer ten thousand beheadings.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “From this day forward, as the Three Caverns’ teachings spread and perfected beings receive them, how much more so for the ignorant. Whoever upholds these Three Caverns’ sutras shall have ghostly soldiers aid them, their works accomplished, their deeds aligned, and the great demon kings protect them. You, Daoists, must diligently convert the ignorant. Those who receive these teachings shall become masters of the Three Caverns, traversing the world to deliver salvation. If one suffers a sudden illness, let the Daoist transmit the sutra and recite this divine incantation, and the thirty-six celestial demon kings shall summon all lesser ghost kings to lend their strength to the disciple.\n\nThe Dao spoke: “When Daoists receive this *Divine Incantation Sutra*, it must not be received alongside other sutras but separately. Why? Because the great demon kings within this sutra possess immense divine power, and thus it must not be mixed with others. It must be transcribed and stored in a separate case. Carry it with you, and ten thousand ghosts shall not draw near. When performing purification rites, employ boundless rituals.\n\nThe Dao spoke: “This *Divine Incantation Sutra* contains the names of all ghost kings, which is why the Most High esteems it. Wherever this sutra is transmitted, no evil ghosts may approach. Only the ancestral spirits, familial ghosts, and household deities of the living may remain; all others must not come recklessly. The great spirits within and beyond, all *wangliang* spirits, deities of life and death, auspicious male and female spirits, and tomb ghosts—from this day forward, banish them ten thousand *li* away. Should they disobey, you shall die ten thousand deaths, without mercy.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “In the world, there are eighty thousand drowning ghosts, each three feet and two inches tall, moving in countless swarms to kill people in the waters. Those who do not believe in the Dao shall not be protected by benevolent spirits and shall die in vain. There are further ninety-eight myriad kinds of water-borne illnesses, thirty-two types of black, white, red, green, and yellow diseases that cannot be cured, and thirty-six kinds of sudden deaths—all afflictions of the sinful. The people of the world do not practice the Dao and law, bringing chaos to the land. Thus, the heavens gather the wicked, who refuse to contemplate goodness, and dispatch divine warriors to punish them with ten thousand diseases. From this day forward, where Daoists perform meritorious deeds and establish purification rites to save people, the demon kings shall all assist these Dharma masters in healing illnesses. If the affliction does not abate, the demon king Gao Linzhi’s head shall be shattered into ninety pieces.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “You, all demon kings, from this day forward, if the men and women of the Middle Kingdom believe in the Dao, receive Our Three Caverns’ teachings, and propagate them across the ten thousand lands, healing the sick and transmitting the sutras wherever they go—you must convert the ignorant, assist in their meritorious works, turn back winds, and halt rains, preventing harm from approaching. Those who do so shall be elevated ten thousand ranks. Should you violate this oath, your heads shall be shattered into ninety pieces.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “All divine kings and all demon kings, you share the same primordial *qi* of Non-Action as I. Yet your conduct differs, and in a hundredfold comparison, you do not equal even one part of Me. Though you possess great divine transformations, you remain My disciples. Why? Because you have not cultivated the natural Dao *qi* and have long harbored malevolent hearts, dwelling within the cycle of birth and death. It is only due to the great blessings accumulated in your past lives that you have attained the ranks of divine kings and demon kings. I, however, reside above the Three Heavens, governing all spirits. From past kalpas, I have pitied all beings as if they were My own children. My laws can give life to the good, perfect the good, slay the malevolent, and eradicate the wicked—not only among livestock and beasts, but also among the virtuous. Now, the great teachings of the Three Caverns spread throughout the world, and the good people of the land often encounter these scriptures. Where Daoists heal the sick and save people, you, demon kings, must assist them in their meritorious works, ensuring their vows are preserved and their virtues unbroken. Should you violate this oath, you shall be beheaded without mercy.”\n\nThe Dao spoke: “In the world, there are many great spirits and long-standing demon kings. You, too, share the same primordial *qi* of Non-Action as I. Yet your conduct differs, and in a hundredfold comparison, you do not equal even one part of Me. You have long submitted as My disciples, and your life and death rest in My hands. All people dwell within heaven and earth, yet many do not believe in the Dao. Now, the teachings of the Three Caverns spread throughout the world, and those who encounter these scriptures—where Daoists heal the sick and save people—you must assist them, ensuring their virtues are not broken.

When the time of *zi* and *chou* arrives, the appointed day shall draw near, and a great slaughter of eighty myriad red soldiers shall come to claim the people—yet the people shall not know. In the years *renwu*, *guiwei*, and *jiashen*, great floods shall drown the land, and plague and war shall gather. The great ghost king Jiang Gongyan shall come with them to kill. From this day forth, if lesser ghosts dare to afflict the sick, they must flee a thousand *li* at once. Should they refuse to depart, the great demon kings shall shatter their heads into eighty fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiawu* cycle of years, thirty-six myriad Qiang and Hu ghosts of the Liao shall come to slay the people. Seventy myriad red crows shall fly across the heavens, and those who see them shall fall ill with plague, beyond all cure. For they do not believe in the sacred teachings, and thus they shall die of sickness. From this day forth, wherever in the land a single person receives the scriptures and transmits these divine incantations, the great demon kings and heavenly beings shall come to aid them, and the sick shall recover of themselves. If they recover, you shall be promoted ten thousandfold. Should they not recover, you, the great kings and lesser ghosts, shall be hewn into ten thousand pieces without mercy.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiachen* cycle of years, the world shall suffer ninety kinds of illness. Many shall die suddenly, and the six livestock shall be stricken with pestilence—for the people do not believe in the Great Dao. If one person receives the scriptures and practices the Dao, the foolish shall mock them. Therefore, Heaven shall dispatch thirty-nine thousand great ghosts to punish them, and the people shall fall ill as plague ghosts come to kill. If there are masters who transmit these divine incantations, eighty myriad billions of mighty heavenly warriors shall come to their aid. Should the sick not recover and die, the great demon kings shall first seize the lesser ghosts. Swiftly restrain your underlings, and do not harm the good people. This is proclaimed to all below—there shall be no pardon.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *jiayin* cycle of years, sixty kinds of illness shall strike, and nine out of ten shall die.

Should they not recover and bring misfortune upon the people, the great ghost kings shall first seize the lesser ghosts and shatter their heads into forty-nine fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The world is filled with wicked people, unfit for the abode of the sacred. Yet when a Daoist establishes the teachings of the Three Caverns, heavenly beings shall all come to protect them. From this day forth, if there are those gravely ill and in peril, the great demon kings shall sever the lesser ghosts of their households, and the sick shall recover of themselves. If they recover, the great demon kings shall ascend. If they do not, you shall be hewn into ten thousand pieces. There are countless lesser ghosts in the world—depart at once, and do not let the living die.

      "translated_text": "The Dao speaks: From this year of *wuyin* in the *guiwei* epoch, the great kalpic turn arrives. Wicked men disbelieve in the Daoist teachings, so Heaven dispatches plague ghosts to inflict seventy-two kinds of disease, slaying the evil. The world is vast, yet ghostly soldiers spread their poison—what is to be done? What is to be done?\n\nIf there be those who uphold the Three Caverns, I shall dispatch four hundred ninety myriad warrior-enforcers to bind the unjust and perverse ghosts for these Dharma masters. Wherever Daoists save lives and traverse the land, demon kings shall assist in binding these ghostly soldiers.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The Jade Women of the Three Heavens, together with the consort of the Great Brahmā Heavenly King—eighty myriad in all—descend to hear the scripture and swear an oath, saying: \"From this day forth, wherever people of the world have Three Caverns Dharma masters perform rites to save lives and recite this *Divine Incantation Scripture*, we shall protect them, preventing plague ghosts and all demonic spirits from harassing the Dharma masters. Should they refuse to depart, we shall be the first to suffer the consequences.\"\n\nAt that time, the Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens, along with eighty myriad Jade Women, all descend together and address the Most High, saying: \"From this day forth, wherever Daoists recite this scripture to save the sick, if any ghost comes to obstruct them and refuses to leave, we shall bind them together, ensuring the Dharma masters remain undisturbed and the sick recover. Those who recover do so by our power, and the multitude of sages rejoice.\" The demon kings each swear to bind the plague ghosts.\n\nThen the Most High recites a gāthā:\n*\"Now I proclaim the divine incantations,\nThe spirits of the spells shall all be destroyed.\nThose slain have their own masters,\nFor evil deeds, none shall be spared.\nYou have all sworn submission,\nCome together to hear my scripture.\nFrom this day, assist the Dao,\nEach and every one, lend your aid.\nDo not again conspire in malice,\nNor together plot wicked schemes.\nIf you plot wicked schemes,\nThe warrior-enforcers shall bind your spirits.\nBoiled in cauldrons, burned by fire,\nYou shall ascend and descend the Knife Mountain’s pavilion.\nIf you follow goodness,\nYou shall not suffer such torments.\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *renwu* year, thirty-nine thousand red ghosts shall come to slay the wicked. Those who encounter Three Caverns Dharma masters shall have plague ghosts driven a thousand *li* away. From this day forth, for those afflicted by imprisonment or illness, merely recite this scripture. This scripture commands eighty myriad great spirits, thirty myriad warrior-enforcers, forty myriad Jade Women, and thirty myriad youths—all shall come together to guard wherever the scripture is recited, and demon kings shall bind the plague ghosts.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Long ago, in the Dark Radiance Palace of the Five Marchmounts, I expounded the *Samādhi Scripture* for all sentient beings. At that time, seven heavenly demon kings, thirty myriad in number, descended as one and swore: \"From this day forth, wherever Dharma masters save the sick and recite this *Divine Incantation Scripture*, we shall clear the path, allowing no evil to approach. Evil ghosts shall flee far, and heavenly beings shall come to assist. Those who can be cured shall have their illnesses dispelled, and those imprisoned shall all be freed. If we fail to bring benefit, we shall willingly accept execution by waist severance, even in death having no regrets.\"\n\nThe Dao speaks: After the *renwu* year and the *xinsi* year, there shall surely come plague ghosts, eighty myriad in number, to slay the wicked. The wicked do not believe in the Dao. Thus, the Jade Women of the Three Heavens and the Great Brahmā Kings of the Nine Heavens—thirty-six myriad in all—descend together and address the Most High, saying: \"From this day forth, wherever Dharma masters traverse, we shall protect them, ensuring the sick recover and those entangled in official matters swiftly gain resolution. If plague ghosts again scheme to harm the good people, we shall bind them as well.\"\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this day forth, those who uphold the Three Caverns shall have seven hundred myriad celestial soldiers of the Nine Heavens and seven hundred myriad Great Demon Kings of the Thirty-Six Heavens, each coming to protect these Dharma masters. For households afflicted by illness or official matters, hasten to recite this scripture. This scripture possesses great spiritual power, naturally dispersing official troubles and curing the sick. Should any refuse to submit, the Demon Kings of the Three Heavens shall come to bind them. Plague ghosts and red soldiers shall perish utterly, and the malevolent spirits of calamity—both within and without—shall be driven ten thousand *li* away. Warrior-enforcers from the ten directions shall shield the Dharma masters.\n\nThen the Most High recites a gāthā:\n*\"The Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns,\nThe true principle declares itself.\nWithout eons of cultivation,\nNone may receive and hear it.\nRecite and save the suffering masses,\nDispelling the hordes of ghosts.\nHeavenly perfected ones surround and protect,\nDemonic spirits dare not approach.\nShould any violate the Dharma,\nTheir bodies shall be shattered into a hundred fragments.\"*\n\nAnother gāthā:\n*\"The Great Elephant is originally formless,\nThe scripture’s words become the Dao.\nAs the Dao turns within the formless,\nNo demon or devil shall not be swept away.\nPurity and turbidity each have their place,\nHeavenly officials come to examine.\nYou, who act with cruelty and treachery,\nCause me constant sorrow and vexation.\nBound in reverse, your heads shall be torn,\nEmbrace the Sword Trees—let this be your fate.\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: Now I observe the world—wicked men multiply, the Six Barbarians invade one another, and they mutually destroy. By the *renwu* year, the world shall be in turmoil, the people unsettled. Blade and soldier, plague and *qi*, shall slay the wicked. The wicked do not believe in the Great Dharma, thus they are made to die.\n\nFrom this day, those who uphold the scriptures of the Three Caverns shall attain transcendence as Upper Immortals. The people of the world are foolish and ignorant. They see Daoists die and the wicked die, yet fail to distinguish the difference, seeing only that both die, with no distinction. The wicked die to enter the Three Evil Paths. Daoists die to be reborn in heaven or among men, or to become great kings, or to ascend as immortals, never to be born in evil realms. Some ascend as immortals in broad daylight, having taken elixirs for a thousand years, first attaining youthful vigor. Those who uphold the Three Caverns, honor their teachers, receive the scriptures, endure hardship in practicing the Dao, and attain this immortality shall never die, even after ten thousand kalpas.",

      "translated_text": "From this day forward, wherever Daoist priests save people, demon kings and their kind shall gather to seize and bind ghostly spirits.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In former times, I was among thirty thousand Chinese immortals, including Dongyue Zhilianzi, each holding the implements of faith to receive the scriptures. We ascended the mountains to build altars and pay homage to the Five Emperors of the Five Directions. To pledge our faith, we broke a silver ring, dividing it as a contract. We drank the cinnabar elixir with our masters and swore an oath, saying: \"Today we drink the elixir, receive the scriptures, and make offerings, vowing never to transgress for life. For those afflicted by illness, urgent calamities, misfortune in their homes, disputes and lawsuits, or prisoners in jail, we shall recite the scriptures and perform fasts. All shall follow the purifying rites of the fast, and Daoist priests shall make this their constant practice.\" The immortals, having received and transmitted the scriptures, spread transformation throughout the land, curing the illnesses of the myriad people. All ghost kings then concealed themselves in hiding.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Many in the world do not believe in the Dao. When one person receives the scriptures, the multitude laughs at them, saying: \"These demonic beings do not wish to live; they flee into the mountains to avoid people and do not seek official rank.\" They do not know that such a person was born from heaven, seeing the world’s defilement and filth, and seeks the Dao of immortality to deliver all people. Yet people, failing to recognize the truth, instead mock them. Alas, alas! Such people shall later incur grave sins, their transgressions plunging them into the scorching fires and boiling waters of the Red-Linked Hell, where they shall remain for three thousand billion kalpas without hope of release. Once their punishment is complete and they are reborn as humans, they shall possess human form but lack human sentiment. Some shall be foolish, deaf, mute, or unable to comprehend human affairs. Others shall be reborn as the six kinds of livestock, eating grass and drinking water, their flesh offered to humans. From birth, they shall endure hardship and suffering, with no one to whom they may appeal. Such is the cycle of these sinners, without end. Reflect upon my words, disciples.\n\nAt that time, the Most High then spoke a verse:\nObstinate and ignorant of the Dharma,\nThey see the world’s accumulators of sin.\nNot only do they themselves refuse to believe,\nBut they mock those who cultivate the truth.\nUnknowing that they came from heaven,\nSoon they shall lie in the grass of men.\nDisciples, you recognize nothing,\nYet together you pass judgment.\nWords uttered, calamity enters,\nEcho and response in but a moment.\nIn death, they receive the torment of poison,\nTheir sins bound in the Red-Linked Hell.\nTurning through the Five Sufferings,\nThey face judgment for billions of kalpas.\nBorn without human sentiment,\nEnsnared by the six afflictions.\nTheir bodies take the forms of livestock,\nHow could they again know form and spirit?\nTheir sins are not from cultivating the Great Vehicle—\nHow then could they escape bodily ruin?\nThus are the causes and conditions;\nReflect upon my words, disciples.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Many in the world harbor malicious intent and do not believe in true words. Heaven dispatches the generals of wanton slaughter—eighty million strong—to roam the world and seize these wicked people. Now, those who uphold the Three Caverns are protected by thirty thousand demon kings, who follow and shield them, aiding their deliverance. When they wish to perform a fast, on the day of its assembly, the skies shall be clear and bright, free from wind and rain, as heavenly beings assist them. Wherever Daoist priests go, people shall see and cherish them, their Dao-qi overflowing, warding off illness and pain. But those who curse and humiliate Daoist priests, bringing them disputes, lawsuits, or official deceit, shall have their souls and spirits seized and slain, to manifest the divine efficacy of the Great Dao. Hasten, hasten, as in the statutes and decrees!\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the world, there is the Ghost King Wuhuan, seven or eight feet tall, each commanding ninety million red-armored soldiers. Every month, they descend to take the qi and lives of people, causing unjust deaths throughout the land. During the *jiaxu* and *jiawu* ten-day periods, they descend to claim lives, spreading thirty-nine thousand kinds of disease that kill men, women, and children. From this day forward, wherever Daoist priests recite this scripture, you shall withdraw your soldiers and banish them ten thousand miles away. If you refuse, you shall be beheaded. Will the three hundred million soldiers of Wuhuan dare disobey?\n\nThe Dao speaks: During the *jiachen* ten-day period, the great demon kings of the Eight Thousand Nine Heavens, led by Weidu, descend with countless followers. Each month, they afflict people with nine thousand incurable diseases, joining forces with the death-generals and ghost-soldiers of the lower realms to slay humanity. From this day forward, restrain your ghostly soldiers and do not wrong the good people. Wherever male or female Daoist officials practice the Dao, you shall assist them. If you do not follow the Five Teachings, your heads shall be shattered into eighty fragments.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the years *xinsi* and *renwu*, people shall die unjustly, the world shall be in turmoil, and the dead shall be many. The Ghost King Wuhuan and the red-qi of the underworld shall kill people, spreading widespread pestilence. In every household, three or four out of ten shall perish. Alas, alas! Only by holding grand purifying fasts in every village, paying homage to the gods of the Five Emperors, and protecting one’s household shall the heavenly gods take notice. Then the Ghost King Wuhuan shall submit and no longer kill.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From the moment one receives this scripture and the master provides guidance, if there is illness, perform a fast. For lawsuits, prisoners, homes haunted by many ghosts, stagnant official careers, or failed harvests of fields and silkworms, perform this fast. When this fast is held, heavenly beings shall come to protect you, and all your wishes shall be fulfilled without a single misfortune. Those who uphold this scripture shall cause ghost kings to submit. From this day forward, wherever the Dharma Masters of the Three Caverns practice, ghost kings shall protect them.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Slaying Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao declares: Since the time of Fuxi, those who perished in ruined armies and defeated battalions, whose forms were maimed in battle, who died by the stench of blades and weapons—countless in their multitudes—have become wandering spirits. Some lie as exposed corpses, their bones disjointed, heads severed from bodies. Some drift or soar, their spirits unable to gather. Some have bodies without heads, feet without hands, mouths without eyes. By the thousands and tens of thousands, they roam and linger, clinging to themselves. They dwell by mountains and lean on trees, seizing the years of human lives. Unaware of their presence, people are plagued by strange disturbances, their hearts unsettled. These ghosts seek to wreak havoc, draining silkworms and fields, bringing every misfortune. They vex households, spawn strange omens, and afflict the living with illness—young and old alike—causing livestock to die suddenly, disputes and legal troubles to arise, and fires and floods to strike repeatedly, rendering all inauspicious. These are none other than the ghosts of those who died untimely in the mortal world, along with Li Ziao of the Clouds, who drift between the heavens and the shores of the sea, riding winds and mounting sparrows, snatching chickens and dogs. Birds and beasts act as portents, cutting short human lives to demand blood offerings. Folk diviners, through their divinations, terrify the living, claiming that deceased kin conspire in these calamities, thus giving rise to vulgar superstitions. When you lesser ghosts hear this, you seize the opportunity to hurl stones with reckless force, ensuring none remain unharmed, heaping misfortune upon misfortune, bringing ruin to the people. You boast: \"Since your time, half of humanity has died unjustly.\"\n\nFrom this day forward, the Great Demon Kings—forty-eight billion in number, each ruling over eight billion lesser kings—shall issue their decrees to gather all the lesser ghosts of the world. When a host falls gravely ill, teetering on the brink of death, you must swiftly seize the ghost afflicting them and banish it a thousand *li* away. Should you disobey, I shall dispatch the Great Slayer Generals—nine hundred million strong—to pursue and slay you without mercy. The Demon Kings shall hasten to apprehend you.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, if any ghost spreads slander among the living, the officials of the Great Yin—one hundred forty thousand strong—shall slay you, the *tuo* ghosts. If any ghost brings legal troubles, imprisonment, or shackles, the Venerable Lord shall send seventy-two thousand to execute you, the ghosts bound by wooden fetters and cangues. If any ghost stirs the *qi* of water or fire, I shall command Song Xianwen to lead the Generals of Wind and Water—two hundred eighty thousand strong—to annihilate you. Thus shall the *dingling* ghosts of shattered tiles, the *shantu muzi* ghosts of ominous trees, the *dayang zousi* ghosts of great calamity, the ghosts of livestock in human form, the *wumu baimei* ghosts of a hundred demonic woods, the *manyidi liao* ghosts of barbarian tribes, the *beidi qianglu* ghosts of northern savages, the ghosts of mountains, the ghosts of valleys, the ghosts of water, the ghosts of fire, the *shegong* ghosts of ten thousand kinds, the ghosts of twelve chaotic illnesses, the ghosts of livestock and servants, the ghosts of self-inflicted death, and all other great and small ghostly minions be driven a thousand *chi* into the earth. Never again shall you afflict the living with illness or legal strife; your ghostly *qi* shall disperse of its own accord. Should you refuse to depart, you shall be slain without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, when Daoists treat the sick and the patient’s family comes to summon you, first craft talismans to place upon the twelve earthly branches, doors, wells, and hearths, each inscribed in cinnabar and hung in its proper place. Then prepare twenty-one talismans for ingestion, to be taken by the patient thrice daily, including three times at night. Thrice daily, the Daoist shall face north in the central courtyard, recite the oral scripture, and perform the *zhuanjing xingdao* ritual, pacing the void in three intervals. If unable to conduct a grand fast, simply follow the Daoist in pacing the void thrice daily. If a grand fast can be held, all must proceed according to the proper method, including the recitation of almsgiving. Almsgiving allows celestial spirits to benefit humanity. Without almsgiving, the spirits of the scriptures will not protect, and the sick shall not recover.\n\n**Sixteen Talismans**\nInscribe in cinnabar on white silk, and affix them according to their respective directions.",

If they do not depart, the Ghost Kings shall shatter their heads into sixty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: There are no truly good people in the world; good people descend from Heaven. Kings who greatly believe in the Dao also come from Heaven. Those who now uphold the Three Caverns must have profound karmic connections from past lives, which is why they now hear and see this. From this day forward, wherever Daoists propagate the teachings, the Ghost Kings shall pursue and assist them, curing the sick and preventing death. If even for a day they do not act according to the method, they shall be executed without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: People in the world do not believe in the Great Law, which is why there are so many sinners. Sinners enter hell, where ghostly soldiers run amok, unable to distinguish good from evil. Now, those who receive the Dao shall have the Great Demon Kings—Zizhen, Konglun, Marshal Mayan, and Chongqi Yuan—each assist and empower them, strengthening their resolve in the Dao. Kings shall uphold it, enlightening the foolish. Where Daoists treat illness, demonic *qi* shall withdraw of its own accord, driven away a thousand *li*. Those who do not submit shall be executed by the Demon Kings without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: The ghosts of the ten directions are all under the command of the Demon Kings. From this day forward, they must not unjustly kill the good or righteous, nor hide by day and move by night to abduct men and women. Where Daoists practice, the Ghost Kings shall assist, preventing evil people and malevolent ghosts from offending the Daoists. If any ghosts or humans harbor ill intentions toward Daoists, they shall all be executed, causing both humans and ghosts to perish, thereby manifesting the resolve of the Dao. These are the supreme words of the Most High—heed them well. If even for a day they are not obeyed, they shall be executed without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: Among the sinners of the world, there are eighty-nine kinds of killing ghosts. The great ghosts of mountains, forests, water, fire, wind, and earth—three thousand nine hundred in number—are led by the Great King of Harmonious Ghosts, who inflict ten thousand kinds of illnesses. The thirty-six kinds of ghosts of the six domestic animals are led by the Ghost King named Dunu, commanding eighty myriad lesser ghosts to spread malignant sores and bloody flux. There are also three thousand crow ghosts, led by the Ghost King named Wenqingzi, who spread red illnesses and white leprosy—diseases that cannot be cured. Those who commit evil, act rebelliously, and do not believe in the essentials of the Three Caverns shall all encounter these malevolent crows, which descend to inflict these diseases, rendering recovery impossible. From this day forward, wherever Daoists save the sick, illnesses shall be eradicated and cured, all wishes fulfilled, and the Ghost Kings shall be elevated to the rank of ten thousand merits.\n\nThe Dao declares: Within the Middle Kingdom, thirty-nine million people are destined for immortality. In the regions of Qin Chuan, Han Shu, and the Three Wu, among them are Sun Daoliu, Wang Zining, Tang Wansheng, Jiao Shizi, Liu Guang, Ma Chengqing, Xun Taichu, Sima Ping, Guo Xiu, Ding Tailun, Yue Fahu, Xie Ying, An Feihou, Wang Zilin, Yuan Boren, Yuan Sunzhi, and Daolin—three thousand in total—who followed Du Lanxiang to gather herbs and all arrived at the Wudang Palace. Now, Daoists who wholeheartedly receive the Three Caverns’ Law shall also encounter these immortals. Daoists must strive to save all people in distress, ensuring their safety. Wherever you recite scriptures and pace the Dao, the Demon Kings shall submit of their own accord. If they do not submit, they shall be executed without mercy, time and again.\n\nThe Dao declares: The essentials of the Three Caverns’ Law lie in divine incantations. Why is this so? This scripture subdues all great Demon Kings, who dare not disturb it. From this day forward, wherever Daoists recite and practice the scriptures, the forty-nine Demon Kings—including Wuchuan, Lianzi, Wenjixiu, Fenglinzi—and their three thousand six hundred lesser kings shall each protect these Daoists, preventing any offense against them.",

From this day forward, in which year shall the plague abate?\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"From this day forward until the year *wuyin* and the year *renwu*, plague ghosts shall slay the wicked.

The people shall grow ever more wicked, disbelieving in the Great Dharma. Those who receive and uphold the Three Caverns are all descended from Heaven, not born of this world.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"From this day forward, if any Daoist receives these Three Caverns scriptures, diligently practices the Way, seeks the Dao, reveres the Three Honored Ones, and saves the foolish, I shall dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers of the Ten Directions and the Thirty-Six Heavenly Mighty Ones to shield and protect them.

Where Daoists transform people, I shall assist them; where there is illness, I shall aid in its cure.

Alas, alas! The people of the world do not believe in the Dao and its laws.

The great flood approaches, yet none know of it. The demon kings were commanded to cease their unjust harm upon the myriad families, to instruct and transform the foolish, and to cause them to receive this scripture. This scripture, the sovereign of all scriptures, contains divine transformations and divine incantations in four scrolls. The Most High expounded it for the turbid and chaotic ages to come. If, in this world, there are those with karmic affinity who encounter this scripture, it will dispel their disasters. Those who receive it shall not be among the afflicted; heavenly beings shall come to welcome them, and they shall behold the True Lord.\n\nThe Dao declares: \"The Supreme Clarity’s Immeasurable Samadhi enables one to ascend as an immortal. The divine transformations and divine incantations subdue all demons. When Daoists receive them, they shall fear no exorcism, whether in the mountains or among men. Receiving these twenty scrolls, one need not rely on other scriptures, for this scripture swiftly grants immortality.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the men and women in attendance rejoiced greatly.

We only wish for the Heavenly Worthy to instruct us fully. We shall uphold it faithfully, and if we come to know its ways, we shall prepare the proper offerings accordingly.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"This scripture subdues demons and eliminates all disasters.

If one is entangled in official matters, stricken by illness, or long mired in suffering, with no relief for months, upon hearing or seeing this scripture, their afflictions shall dissolve of themselves, and all calamities shall vanish. Those who receive it shall have immortals attend them. They shall revere their masters as the sun and moon, and cherish the scripture as pearls and jade. First, they must sacrifice to the Five Emperors of the Primordial Beginning, then break the covenant to receive it. Only afterward shall they transmit it in accordance with the teachings. In households afflicted by illness, Daoists shall perform the scripture’s recitation. When reciting, they shall first inscribe the eight talismans and place them upon the eight gates of the household. Then, for the family conducting the recitation and the Way’s practices, all inner demons and outer [obstructions] shall scatter and perish upon hearing these divine incantations.

Those who receive it shall have their names recorded by immortals in the Jade Register, escaping the nine perils of the water’s calamity.

Yet if even one person hears of this, rejoices, receives, upholds, and makes offerings to it, I shall dispatch armored soldiers, celestial warriors, and forty-nine billion red cavalry from the ten directions to constantly follow them, granting them wisdom, fulfilling their heart’s desires, elevating their official ranks, and bestowing a hundred blessings naturally, delivering them from the Three Calamities and nine perils.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"The three revolutions draw near, demonic forces run rampant, and the great waters surge—do you not know this? The Most High grieves that all beings shall be ensnared within them. How can this not be sorrowful? Alas, alas! The world is turbid, its people false.

The wise shall receive it and urge others to know it. From this day forth, those who receive and uphold it shall have heavenly beings protect and assist them, celestial warriors guard their gates, and the hundred evils and plague *qi* shall not disturb them.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"From this day forth, if any receive these four scrolls of the Divine Transformation and Divine Incantation Scripture, I shall dispatch armored soldiers from the ten directions, merit-recording messengers, immortal maidens, and red chariot warriors to constantly follow those who receive the scripture, ensuring no evil befalls them. When the great calamity arrives, dragons shall rise to welcome them. Those who receive this scripture shall not suffer unjust death. If one is gravely ill, they shall receive this scripture. If entangled in official matters, they shall receive this scripture. If men or women are unwell, they shall receive this scripture. If a household suffers misfortune, they shall receive this scripture. This scripture is like medicine, capable of curing all ailments. You Daoists, believe in and receive it. If you heed my words, what further concern shall I have?\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"Now, I command the demon kings of the ten directions: from this day forth, when those in illness, distress, or peril are saved by Daoists reciting this scripture, you shall protect them and not allow unjust harm. I sternly instruct the Registrar of Life and Death: where this scripture is recited, if the sick are fated to die, you shall grant them life. If their names are inscribed in the Stone Coffin or their death registers are sealed, you shall expunge them. For long illnesses or official entanglements, you shall examine and absolve them in accordance with my teachings. If any disobey my words and harm the innocent, the demon kings shall sever them into ten thousand pieces, cleaving their bodies into a thousand fragments without mercy. Beware, beware!\"\n\nThe Dao declares: \"In the final revolution of the kalpa, the world shall be brief and its people wicked, with many disbelieving in the Dao. Those who receive this scripture shall escape great calamities, and immortals and jade maidens shall attend them.\"",

As they rise to receive the people, those who are destined shall ascend without awareness of their own ascent. The world shall be vast with water, nowhere untouched—only those who have received this scripture shall escape.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year *jiāxū*, men and women of the Central Kingdom who believe in the Dao and receive this scripture, entering the mountains to refine their essence in meditation, shall be beyond count. The great assembly, hearing the scripture, rejoiced and all sought to receive it. Three hundred thousand arose as one, circumambulating the Most High seven times and bowing thrice, saying: \"We wish to receive this covenant.\" The Most High replied: \"Excellent, excellent! I shall bestow it upon you.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: In this age of the Five Turbidities, people die unjustly in great numbers, and none believe in the Dao. Ghostly soldiers drive them away, and great disasters draw near, yet the foolish remain unaware. If you can receive and venerate these twenty scrolls of scripture, when the great flood comes, immortals shall come to welcome you, and you shall have no fear of death. If you trust my words, what cause have I for worry?\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, those who receive my scriptural covenant shall have divine spirits assist them. Their households shall be naturally protected, and no evil shall befall them. You, the Daoist priests, must believe this and exhort all, that even the foolish may escape the Three Disasters. If any receive and uphold this scripture yet fail to cross the Three Rivers, I shall not be called a sage, nor shall I remain in this world to transform it.\n\nI solemnly command the great deities of the ten directions, all malevolent ghosts, demon kings, and evil spirits: From this day forward, wherever this scripture is recited, all illnesses shall be cured, and official entanglements resolved. Those who receive this scripture shall have their ten thousand wishes fulfilled.\n\nThe great assembly, hearing the scripture, rejoiced, and each received the covenant to practice it.\n\nThe Dao declares: You, the Daoist priests, need only receive these twenty scrolls of the *Divine Incantation Scripture*, and you too shall attain immortality. Why? Because this scripture subdues all demon kings, and benevolent spirits guard it. Those who receive this scripture—if they possess the immortal bones of past lives, descended from heaven—are no ordinary mortals. Among the men and women of the Central Kingdom and the six barbarian tribes of later generations, there shall be those who submit to its transformation. In the land of Wu and Shu, many believe in the Dao. The wise of the four directions, scattered and displaced, shall enter the mountains. In the years *jiǎshēn* and *rénchén*, the inauspicious fate shall be known. Daoist priests, diligently exhort one another and transform all beings. Those who personally receive this scripture shall have the protection of heavenly beings and shall never die unjustly.\n\nThe Dao declares: Even if you have received the *Wondrous Treasure Scripture of the Infinite Samadhi of Highest Clarity*, without receiving this scripture, you shall not attain immortality. Without receiving this scripture, you shall not be called a Daoist priest, nor shall you be able to cure the ten thousand illnesses. But if you receive this scripture and venerate it in your home, all ghosts shall submit, and in life and death, you shall receive grace. The Dao does not speak falsely—believe this.\n\nThe great and small in the assembly each sought to receive it. The Most High, moved by compassion for all, bestowed the precepts upon them. You who receive this scripture must not slight your teachers, nor disdain the scripture. Uphold it throughout your life, contemplate the spirits, and meditate upon the Dao. Thereafter, you shall ascend as immortals, welcomed by nine dragons.\n\nHearing this, the great assembly leapt with joy in their hearts, each rising in astonishment to bow thrice.

On the first and fifteenth days of the month, burn incense and pay homage to the ten directions, as well as to your teacher. If the teacher has departed, bow four times in the direction of their departure. If the teacher resides with you, go and pay homage.\n\nThe assembly, having received the teaching, each bowed thrice and pledged to practice it.\n\n*The Fifth Scroll of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantation Scripture*\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Most High’s Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantation Scripture*\n*The Vow [Chapter]*",

      "translated_text": "The Dao declares: From this day forward until the years *jiǎxū* and *rénwǔ*, people will face widespread suffering, hardship, and death, wandering the lower realms, while the Dao’s *qi* daily grows in power. Its flourishing will center in the lands south of the Yangtze and within Han and Shu, where the Three Caverns’ teachings spread, and the six barbarian tribes perish entirely. Ghostly soldiers will run rampant, poisoning and harming the people, spreading pestilence to kill—no single region spared.\n\nFrom this day forward, those who uphold this scripture shall be protected by Heaven, and even malevolent spirits that bring omens shall be bound by my vow. All demonic essences, I shall swear against. From now on, wherever a Dharma Master saves a person, legal disputes shall be resolved, and the sick shall recover. Should they not recover, the Most High shall dispatch three hundred forty-nine thousand Heavenly Valiant Warriors to seize and banish all malevolent ghosts—male and female—beyond a thousand *li*. Where Daoists administer healing, none shall fail to recover, for the great deities of the ten directions shall aid these Dharma Masters in curing illness.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, wherever those afflicted by illness encounter a Master of the Three Caverns reciting this scripture, all plague spirits shall flee ten thousand *li*, forbidden from causing disturbance. Legal cases and imprisoned convicts shall naturally dissolve. Should any refuse to depart, I shall send a thousand myriad Heavenly Valiant Warriors and Celestial Soldiers to descend and slay you.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years *xīnsì*, *rénwǔ*, and *guǐwèi*, seventy-two kinds of disease shall ravage the world, killing the wicked. The wicked, for their disbelief in the Dao and its laws, shall be slain. From this day forward, wherever in the Middle Kingdom a Dharma Master saves the afflicted, I shall dispatch the Lords of the Nine Heavens to enforce this vow, banishing all malevolent ghosts beyond distant lands, forbidding them from harming those under the Dharma Master’s care. Swiftly, as the Most High’s decree from the Central Heaven commands! Should any disobey, the Heavenly Valiant Warriors shall descend to execute you, slaying without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, wherever a Daoist recites this scripture and practices the Dao for others, that place becomes the Most High’s Mystic Hall, where heavenly beings reside. All afflicted by legal troubles or pestilence shall recover, disputes shall cease, and prisoners shall be freed. Why? Because these are the Most High’s wondrous words, spoken from the Golden Mouth, and thus the Heavenly Valiant Warriors of the Three Heavens shall execute the plague spirits.\n\nThe Dao declares: Now, there are Dharma Masters who forsake worldly office, seeking the Three Caverns’ teachings and devoting themselves to the world. Witnessing its perils, they heal and relieve with single-minded devotion, aiding those entangled in legal troubles or illness. Such persons possess great blessings from past lives, their fortune flowing through the Middle Kingdom, destined to be reborn as teachers of all beings. Wherever I see such Dharma Masters healing and saving, I shall swear against all plague spirits—they shall not return.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, the world shall face great floods, and ghostly soldiers shall roam. In the years *jiǎxū* and *rénwǔ*, many Red Accumulation Ghosts shall spread across the Nine Provinces, twelve hundred commanderies, eighteen thousand counties, and three hundred million villages, slaughtering the good and virtuous, inflicting swift and grievous illness, causing the Most High’s true people to die unjustly. From now until the years *jiǎzǐ* and *rénchén*, calamity shall surge like ten-thousand-*zhang* waves. All these are your demonic ghosts—ancient dead generals, rulers, great ministers, lowly officials, lingering *qi*, worldly bandits, male and female [spirits of]... disasters of water, fire, blades, and warfare... wandering ghosts. When people fall into decline, these spirits vie to possess them, scheming to harm the people, seizing their reputations, craving their blood and offerings. Countless billions infest homes, manifesting strange lights, inciting disputes and legal troubles.\n\nFrom this day forward, should any refuse my words and linger in these dwellings, the Great Generals of the Ten Directions’ Slaying Ghosts—three hundred thousand strong—shall slay you, permitting no delay. Swiftly, as the Most High’s oral command! Should any refuse to depart, the Demon Kings’ *Jūliúzǐ* and their two hundred thousand followers shall shatter your heads into twelve pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: The Twelve Demon Kings of the Three Heavens’ *Jùpóqiāng*, one hundred twenty thousand strong, shall descend to the world. From this day forward, if any Red *Dīng* Fire Ghosts, each leading seventy-eight myriad followers, spread pestilence and wrongfully kill the good, the *Jiànhé* Official Soldiers—thirty-six thousand strong—shall seize and bind them, delivering them to the Nine Heavens’ prisons. Thus shall the world’s good people recover from illness, their households know peace, legal cases cease, all matters resolve, and disputes vanish. Those who seek shall attain the boundless bestowal of the Great Dao. Should you disregard my words, the Hundred-*Zhang* Ghost King shall behead you. Swiftly, as the Most High’s oral command and statutes! Should you disobey, you ghosts who harm the people, the Seven Heavenly Demon Kings shall shatter your heads into twenty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years *jiǎxū* and *rénwǔ*, there shall appear Black-Foot Ghosts, their bodies thirty-six *chǐ* tall, their eyes red and yellow. Some transform into red crows, called *Zúrì*. They spread myriad diseases, flying in flocks to alight upon roofs, inflicting swift illness. The afflicted suffer yellowing bodies, alternating chills and fever, dripping discharge, red-and-black dysentery, scorched and ashen faces. They come and go unpredictably, refusing food and drink, vomiting when they try, blood and urine flowing together. Their eyes redden, their heads ache, their sinews spasm, their hands and feet convulse—all these are the work of Black-Foot Ghosts. This ghost king is named *Dàtóulú*, leading a horde of eighty million brothers. I know your names—depart a thousand *li* at once! Should you refuse, you shall be slain without mercy. Swiftly, as the statutes command!\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, in the year *jiǎchén*, forty-nine myriad Black-Faced Ghost Kings named *Zhāngcháng* shall descend among the people, along with forty-six myriad billion followers, roaming the world to spread dysentery.",

When they gallop forth, they become red-headed crows, ninety million strong. They enter the homes of men, seizing the young, the old. They spread ten thousand kinds of illness, their *qi* of disease thick and heavy. These are the harms wrought by the Earth Lord, who calls himself *Lǐ Zǐ’áo*. *Zǐ’áo* and his brothers, a thousand thousand myriad strong, conspire to slay men, killing without reason. From this day forward, flee swiftly to other lands. Should you refuse, bringing sickness and death to men, strife to households, and blight to fields and silkworms, you shall die. Ghost King *Chìshí*, your head shall shatter into ten thousand pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎshēn* decade of the year, there shall come the Ghost Kings *Méng Tián* and *Wáng Jiǎn*, each leading thirty thousand red ghosts to traverse the world. They incite men to quarrelsome *qi*, afflict them with foul dysentery, swollen faces and eyes, fullness in the chest, vomiting, and restlessness. They cause infants to cry in terror, bring official disputes and slander, cast men into prisons, and spread a thousand illnesses and ten thousand afflictions—poverty, distress, and hardship, children who do not survive, fields and silkworms that yield no harvest, and ten thousand unfulfilled wishes. All these are the works of the Ghost Kings *Wáng Jiǎn* and his kind. From this day forth, should *Méng Tián*, *Wáng Jiǎn*, and the others fail to gather their ghostly troops, their underling ghosts shall perish utterly, and the heads of the Ghost Kings shall shatter into eighty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎxū* decade of the year, there shall come five nations of Ghost Kings, their ghostly troops the dead generals of *Sòng*, *Zhào*, *Yān*, *Wèi*, and *Lǔ*. Each king leads thirty-six thousand ghosts, roaming the lands of *Shǔ* and *Hàn*, seizing women, children, and old men from all under heaven, spreading forty-six kinds of illness to kill men. From this day forth, we know your names: Ghost King *Huáinánzǐ* has returned, along with *Bái Gōng*, *Hán Shè*, *Sòng Xiàn*, and *Wáng Shàn*. From this day forth, should you stir your underling ghosts to continue killing men, your heads shall shatter into seventy-eight pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the *jiǎyín* year and decade, there shall come thirty-nine thousand ghosts, their Ghost King named *Jùliúbù*, each leading eight hundred thousand ghosts to descend and spread sixteen thousand kinds of illness, maladies beyond cure. They cause kings to falsely accuse their people, oppressing the myriad folk, leaving none whole. Neighboring states send raiders, evil ghosts enter homes, rendering dwellings uninhabitable—all these are the works of such ghosts. From this day forth, you Ghost Kings and your underling ghosts, gather your ghostly troops. Should you refuse to depart, the radiant might of the Heavenly Capital shall slay you without mercy.

Yet those of great fortune, Daoists who receive the incantations of the Three Caverns and come to recite them, shall be aided by the Ghost Kings. The Mighty Ones shall issue commands to repel these minor ghostly bandits, reconcile the ghosts of the household, the lords of wells and hearths, the ghosts of kinship, and all others. The lingering dead within homes, ghosts from other lands, and those in households who receive no offerings—each shall be gathered and delivered to the Northern Prison of *Tiānyī* to be slain. Should you fail to heed my words, your great Demon Kings’ heads shall shatter into eighty pieces.\n\nThe Dao declares: From this day forth, should even a single person fall ill, it is entirely the work of your minor Ghost Kings. From this day forth, should a man or woman fall ill, and a Daoist come to recite scriptures and provide healing, you must swiftly depart ten thousand *li*, allowing the living to recover, and I shall promote you on high.

If there are those who uphold the Three Caverns, converting and instructing the people to receive them, and if the sick recite the scriptures, the spirits of the scriptures shall save them, and their illness may be cured. From this day forth, wherever this scripture is recited, I shall dispatch the mighty warriors of the ten directions to transform and admonish the plague ghosts and all evil spirits, compelling them to seize these ghosts. The sick shall be spared, their illnesses cured, and no further harm shall befall them. Those imprisoned or sentenced to penal servitude shall be naturally released. Should they not receive this grace, the Demon Kings shall be the first to face judgment, and they shall be beheaded without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: After the year of *jiayin*, there shall appear thirty-six myriad and three three-legged ghosts, each nine *zhang* in height, wielding red staffs. They shall enter the homes of the people, inflicting sixty-two kinds of illness, sickening and killing the wicked. Their name is *Quyin*, and each commands three hundred and sixty vertical-eyed ghosts, their eyes all red. Some ride the winds and clouds, seizing lives wantonly, slaughtering livestock in an instant. There shall be one thousand two hundred green plague ghosts, and the plague ghosts’ brethren shall number eighty million. Male and female ghosts, nine hundred million strong, shall enter the homes of the people, lying in wait for the young, causing sudden death. There shall also be two-headed ghosts, named *Dangjin*. *Dangjin* is violent and cruel, constantly terrorizing the common folk, afflicting them with illness. These ghosts falsely devour the people’s pigs and chickens, deceitfully posing as great spirits to delude the foolish. The foolish believe them, slaughtering livestock to offer sacrifices to these ghosts. The ghosts seize the opportunity, turning it into custom. If they do not receive offerings, they cause illness and pain. From this day forth, wherever there are those who uphold this scripture, I shall dispatch thirty-nine thousand celestial soldiers to harmonize and admonish these ghosts, driving them a thousand *li* away. Should they not depart, the Great Demon Kings of the Three Heavens and the lords of the ten directions shall hack them into ten thousand pieces, and there shall be no pardon.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *renwu*, there shall already be thirty-six kinds of great ghosts, named *Black-Headed Blazing*, also called *Red Canopy*, and *Aju* as their third name. Each shall lead thirty-nine thousand followers, all wielding white staffs and ghost-slaying blades seven *chi* long. They shall enter the homes of the people, seizing lives wantonly, inflicting one hundred and twenty kinds of illness, sickening and killing the wicked. Sixty kinds of malign qi shall enter the bodies of the people, causing sudden death. From this day forth, wherever those afflicted with such illnesses find masters of the Three Caverns reciting scriptures and performing the Dao, they shall all be cured. Should the ghosts still refuse to yield, causing the people’s illnesses to persist and official matters to remain unresolved, the Great Brahmā Heavenly Kings and the lords of the ten directions shall behead them without mercy.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *renwu*, there shall already be thirty-seven thousand red crows, spreading thirty-nine thousand kinds of illness to sicken and kill the wicked. There shall also be eighty-two kinds of illness, bringing misfortune to the wicked. When afflicted by these illnesses, if there are masters of the Three Caverns reciting scriptures and performing the Dao, they may be cured.

Should they not depart, I shall dispatch the warriors of the Three Heavens and one hundred thousand *Red Ruin* soldiers to seize and behead them.

Should you corrupt even one person’s good heart, the celestial beings shall punish you, and you shall not attain human form—how then could you become an immortal? From this day forth, wherever there are those who heal the sick, celestial beings shall come of their own accord to assist and protect you.\n\nThree celestial maidens, numbering five thousand myriad, shall descend together, accompanying *Magu* to roam *Duyang Mountain*, traversing the Five Marchmounts. They shall witness the people of the world suffering from illness and death, not merely a few. The Mysterious Woman exclaims in alarm: “Alas! Celestial calamity! The people shall perish entirely—how can they be saved?” Grieving together, they come to the *Mystic Capital* and report fully to the Most High. The Most High says: “Go among the people of the world and convert them all, instructing them to uphold the Three Caverns. The scriptures of the Three Caverns can deliver sentient beings from all hardships. If you all go to the lands and convert the people to the scriptures, they shall come to revere and believe. When they fall ill or face official troubles, recite the scriptures for them. After one night of recitation, the dead shall revive, and official matters shall resolve themselves. From this day forth, wherever there are masters saving the people, I shall dispatch celestial beings to transform and admonish them, and the plague ghosts shall naturally depart.”\n\nThe Dao declares: These three maidens were greatly blessed in their former lives and have now become holy women, teaching and converting all people. They are the most revered in the ten directions. They transform a hundred times in a single day, and none can match them. From now on, if people of later generations hear the names of these three maidens, these women shall also come to save them. Should they suffer from illness or official troubles, recite this scripture, and the great spirits of the ten directions shall come to their aid, preventing any misfortune. If you have the merit of converting others, Heaven shall know of it.\n\nThe Dao declares: From the year of *gengchen*, there shall already be ninety hundred million black slaying ghosts, each six *zhang* in height. Each shall lead eighty-four thousand lesser ghosts and red-headed plague ghosts to lie in wait for the people. Their name is *Yingnü*, their eyes all red. They shall roam the ten directions, entering the homes of the people to seize the young, inflicting one hundred kinds of illness to kill them.

Countless in number, they wrong the good people, killing the innocent, deceiving and driving away family, hastening the Stove Lord, disturbing the household spirits, obstructing every matter, and inflicting myriad illnesses, swift and severe. Riding the wind and mounting sparrows, they recklessly create strange lights and omens. Since recent times, their offenses have been beyond count. Now, the *Zhengyi Gongcao*, the *Daming* Envoys, and the *Yanshen* Envoys, each leading nine hundred million iron-faced cavalry officers wielding great halberds and ghost-slaying implements, shall descend together with the forty-nine thousand mighty warriors of the Most High. They shall capture and execute the dead generals of this land, all demons and evil spirits, the millions of specters, and all inauspicious omens that come to harm the households of the living. Each shall be seized, bound, and slain, purging the households of slaying ghosts. The ghost kings shall all exert their strength to successively bind them. Should any ghost refuse to depart, the ghost kings shall execute them a thousand times without pardon. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the land, there are great ghost lords such as Deng Ai, Zhong Shiji, Zhao Shan, Wang Mang, Li Ao, Du Zhou, Liu Douwu, Wang Li, Xiahou Ying, Jiang Gongyan, Ye Gongli of Nanyang, Xia Tanzhi, Xiao He, Shentu Bo, Han Xin, Tian Jin, Liang Hong, Gao Pei, Sun Wen, Sima Jiong, and Liu Yuanda. These great ghosts command the people of the world. Some have temples dedicated to Emperor Wu and King Wen, with continuous offerings and unceasing sacrifices. Each commands armies to haunt the people of the world, afflicting them with illness and death, year after year, month after month, inflicting thousands of kinds of illness. Some cause heaviness in the limbs, alternating chills and fever, dysentery, swelling, watery distension, blackened diseases, pain in the head and eyes, burning heat in the chest and back.

Pestilential qi shall billow forth, and thirty-nine myriad kinds of illness shall slay the people. Those who flee into the mountains shall number thousands upon thousands. The people shall know no peace, cut down by blades, plagues, and ghostly slaughter—killed without reason.\n\nHeaven shall dispatch seven hundred thousand red-clad soldiers, each wielding a bronze halberd, to slay the wayward ghosts and gather all the world’s calamities. Should the Three Heavens’ Great Demon Kings wrongfully execute any, each of those demon kings—Wūwán and the rest—shall be executed without mercy. Begone ten thousand leagues hence!\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in statute and command!\n\nThe Dao declares: The world teems with wicked men, and Heaven dispatches warriors to execute them, first inquiring into their good and evil. How could the vast hosts of Heaven’s soldiers be resisted? Yet should Daoist priests recite scriptures to save them, let them live, and cease the slaughter.\n\nFrom this day forward, should any in the world suffer illness or imprisonment, wherever Daoist priests perform petitions and recite scriptures to heal them, the Great Demon Kings and lesser ghost-kings shall aid in their recovery, resolving all matters. Should any fail to recover or be released, and quarrels persist unbroken, the great ghost Yìzhēn and his kind shall hack them into ten thousand pieces, without exception or mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the Most High’s oral command and statute!\n\nThe Dao declares: The great gate’s ghostly officer, Lord Dàzhēn; the small gate’s ghostly officer, Lord Xiǎozhēn; the chamber’s guardian, Yī Wén; the rear guardian, Wàn Lún; the hearth’s guardian, Yán Jǐng; the road’s guardian, Shī Gòng; the great ghosts within and without; the household’s calamities; the male and female guests who perished; those slain by water, fire, metal, or wood—each shall restrain themselves. What ghost now comes to sicken the living? The people are in peril.\n\nThe Most High dispatches a hundred million red-clad soldiers, warriors who bind ghosts and beat them to death with bronze cudgels, then deliver them to the Warding Off Evil?—handing them over to the Heavenly One’s Northern Prison. Fearing wrongful harm, He commands that all the people be instructed: should any household suffer illness, swiftly release the afflicted. Let them be treated according to the Dao, that the living may recover and neither people nor ghosts come to harm. Should any ghost refuse to depart, the sick shall not recover. The Great Demon Kings and lesser ghost-kings shall be hacked into a hundred pieces, without mercy.\n\nAll as in the Most High’s oral command—no delay permitted!\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in statute and command!\n\nThe Dao declares: Nowadays, the world’s people die wretchedly from pestilence. From this day forward, We swear with the demon kings Xià Yín, Wūwán, Wū Yán, Chì Bō, Hóng Qiū, and others: In this age, sickness abounds, and sinners die unaware, ignorant of their own salvation. We now command the Three Caverns’ Dharma Masters to enlighten the foolish. Among the foolish, there shall be those who believe—men and women of office. Should they hold to these incantations, observe fasts and lectures in their villages, practice the Six Periods’ rituals, perform the Dao, give alms, and meditate, then in such places, you ghost-kings shall aid in enlightening the foolish. Do not let them fall ill; should they fall ill, let them recover swiftly, and permit no hundred evils to assail them.\n\nAll as We have spoken—you may ascend. Should you defy Our teaching, your heads shall be shattered into ten pieces, without mercy.\n\nAll as in the Most High’s oral command and statute!",

      "translated_text": "**Summoning Ghosts Chapter**\n\nThe Dao spoke: Within the Three Realms, those who believe in the sutras are rare indeed. Thus, worthy persons are not born, and many evil people gather and multiply. When there are those who believe in the Dharma and uphold the sutras, they come from Heaven above. The calamity of *jiashen* brings Heaven’s welcome to the Daoists. It does not welcome sinners, for sinners do not believe in the Dharma and are thus not received.\n\nIn the years *renwu* and *gengchen*, plague ghosts and weapons will slaughter people, leaving few alive in the world. During times of illness, if a Master of the Three Caverns performs the turning of sutras and the Daoist rites, the Heavenly Worthy will summon the great deities of the ten directions, causing sickness to be cured and official matters to resolve themselves. Should they disobey this command, the ghost-kings shall be the first to be punished.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the year *xinsi*, there will be a ghost named *Duluna*, standing three *zhang* tall, with eyes slanting and mouth askew, ears six *cun* long, wielding an iron staff. It will roam among people, striking down the wicked. Plagues, epidemics, and official troubles will be accompanied by sixty-nine thousand ghosts. Some will take the form of great crows; where these crows pass, people will all fall ill and die, beyond cure. By the year *renchen*, the people will be greatly afflicted, and by *jiashen*, they will perish entirely. If the kingdom’s Dharma Masters can govern this, performing the turning of sutras and Daoist rites, the great armies of the Three Heavens will come to protect them, sparing them from harm.\n\nDaoists transform people, causing them to receive the Three Caverns’ sutras. The Dao spoke: As *jiashen* approaches, ghostly soldiers will slaughter people, and forty-nine thousand *Wuxuan* warriors will traverse the realm. Wherever a Master of the Three Caverns turns the sutras and practices the rites of the Three and Five, each will be guarded, preventing evil ghosts from drawing near. Evil ghosts will flee far away, aiding the Daoist in enlightening the foolish. If kings, emperors, regional lords, officials of two thousand *shi*, magistrates, nobles, or common folk uphold the Three Caverns, they shall later obtain great blessings, their fortune extending to their descendants for generations without end. They will be born among heavenly beings and humans, always encountering sages, never becoming the poor, and never forsaken by emperors, ever assisting the sovereign.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the world’s wicked places, good people are not born. If there are now noble and virtuous people, they come from Heaven above. Why is this? Evil people do not believe in the Great Dharma, nor do they understand the sutras’ words. Though they may have been born human, their past lives held little fortune, and now, though they are nobles with wealth, they do not recognize the Dharma’s canon, having no affinity with it. These are sinners indeed. I know this well: worldly official glory is like morning dew—when the sun rises, it dries up. Glory does not last long; in an instant, one dies. It is better to study immortality, which stands firm for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Daoists transform people, causing them to uphold the Three Caverns, and soon they will ascend. If there are illnesses or official troubles, turning the sutras brings great fortune. Wherever this is done, plague ghosts will die of themselves. Exert yourselves to encourage one another.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Since the year *wuyin*, there has been a great ghost with a red nose, named *Fuzi*, nine *chi* tall, with three faces and one eye. There is also a ghost with two heads and one body, three *chi* tall, each with red eyes. Another ghost, named *Daye*, has three heads and one body, seven *chi* tall. Countless in number, they wield white blades, roaming the world to seize children. They travel among the clouds, their bloated forms emitting red *qi*, causing people to suffer chills and fever, vomiting blood, heart distension, and broken *qi* in the ribs. At such times, if a Master of the Three Caverns comes to turn the sutras, the sick will recover, and official matters will resolve themselves. If they do not recover, the ghost-kings shall be the first to be punished.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From now until the year *gengchen*, there will be thirty-six thousand evil ghosts named *Tianchi*, accompanied by thirty thousand followers, roaming the world and wrongfully killing the good. By the year *renwu*, another three thousand nine hundred red-headed ghosts, named *Datou*, will descend to slaughter people. Weapons will clash throughout the world—it cannot be endured for long. Disasters and rebellions will arise in all directions, and the Six Barbarians will perish entirely. The Daoist Dharma will flourish, while the secular world will decline. In the year *jiashen*, the people will die out.\n\nTo know how to survive these calamities, only those who uphold the Three Caverns, revere their masters, and honor the sutras will be protected by heavenly deities and thus ascend to Heaven, where heavenly beings will welcome them.\n\nThe Dao spoke: By the year *renwu*, the world will be in turmoil. The common people will suffer hardship, and the Six Barbarians will invade one another. The people will be restless, and men and women will flee in chaos. The lands of Shu and Han will be vast, and the people will suddenly perish. Daoists will enter the mountains to cultivate the Three Caverns and meet the Perfected Lords. The Perfected Lords are not far off—this will occur between *renchen* and *renwu*.\n\nFrom now on, Heaven will slay the foolish, but Daoists will save them, preserving their lives. The Dao spoke: In the year *renwu*, there will be eighty thousand lowly ghosts named *Dadan*, each three *chi* and six *cun* tall, accompanied by thirty-nine billion companions. They will wield red staffs, roaming among people to kill the wicked. There will also be white crows, as large as cartwheels, flying in the millions. They will enter people’s homes and kill their children. If people see them, or if large fish die in the water and people eat them, they will die. If deer die in the wilderness and people eat them, they too will die. Daoists who uphold this sutra and teach others will prevent heavenly beings from violating these prohibitions.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The world’s fate is nearing its end, and the waters will soon rise. Men and women will all perish, except for those who uphold the Three Caverns—they alone will be preserved. From now on, wherever Daoists save people from official troubles and illnesses, four hundred thousand heavenly maidens will descend to assist, sparing them from misfortune. Daoists, diligently transform the people.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The great kalpa is approaching, and the people are mostly foolish, unaware of the coming disasters. Daoists who first see this text must urgently transform the people, causing them to enter the Three Caverns.",

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\nWithin this sutra are recorded the names of all great demon kings who slay ghosts and govern the people. Those who receive this scriptural Dharma shall themselves attain deliverance, each storing it in a single casket. Should any suffer official disputes, imprisonment, grave illness, or prolonged affliction, perform a one-day-and-night purification rite, and I shall summon the hundred ghosts to interrogate them, that the sick may recover before they are released.\n\nYou Daoists, diligently transform the myriad people. Wherever a Daoist who has received the scriptures treats illness, the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings shall assist in healing. When the sick recover, you shall ascend in rank, and I shall never fail my word. From this day forward, I make this covenant with you, the great demon kings.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this jiǎchén year onward, three hundred sixty thousand black ghosts shall spread dysentery and bloody flux, and ghostly children shall come by night to slay men. The ghosts of the Six Barbarians, numbering in the millions, often take the forms of women or elders, entering homes to seize infants and causing livestock to die suddenly. The state neglects its people, and the populace scatters. High ministers and petty officials wrongfully take lives. In such times, ghostly soldiers bring chaos and disease.\n\nYou Daoists, simply perform the rites and recite the scriptures for one day and one night. I shall dispatch three hundred sixty thousand celestial soldiers from the Three Heavens to summon the ghosts of the ten directions and question them. Which ghosts afflict the people? Each shall be examined, and good and evil separated. The celestial soldiers shall execute them, exterminating their kindred, and show no mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The mountain and forest ghosts, named Xuánzǐdū, command twenty-nine million ghosts. They commonly cause sudden death, slaying infants and elders, entering homes to frighten chickens, dogs, and children. There are also thirty-nine thousand red-turbaned ghosts who enter homes to seize livestock. Further, eighty thousand green insect ghosts—each three feet six inches tall—constantly wield heavenly fire to burn homes, bringing official disputes and slander upon the inhabitants. There are also the great moving green ghosts, forty-nine thousand in number, each three *zhàng* tall, who wield red staffs to bludgeon the people to death.\n\nThose who are virtuous and faithful to the Dharma shall not be harmed. But the wicked—those who lack righteousness, kill living beings, defy the Dao, neglect their parents, deceive Daoists, or revile masters and disciples—shall be executed without mercy and consigned to hell. Some shall suffer incurable illness, myriad calamities converging upon them, their agony beyond words. If Daoists do not intervene, their aid shall be of no avail.\n\nThe Dao spoke: These wicked ones disrespect their masters, defy the Dharma, slander Daoists, seclude themselves to revile their teachers, and utter their masters’ names. Their sins are grave; they shall be dragged into the Red Sand Hell, where they shall remain for ten thousand kalpas. Upon release, they shall become field-protecting crows, ever dwelling in water to guard ten thousand *qǐng* of fields. Or, before death, they shall suffer illness and torment, pain clinging to their bodies, their fields and silkworms failing, their endeavors unfulfilled, and all shall mock them. These afflictions are the retribution for their past lives’ revilement of masters and disciples.\n\nFrom this day forward, should such people exist, the great demon kings shall swiftly punish them. Those who disrespect masters and disciples or do not uphold the Three Caverns shall be bound and executed without mercy by the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings.\n\nThe Dao spoke: You Daoists, in serving your masters, must be single-minded. If your hearts remain unchanged, you bring suffering upon yourselves. To slight or revile your masters is to commit the five rebellions and be unfilial, to slander the common folk, forcibly seize their wealth, teach others to do evil, or incite litigation and murder. Such people shall be seized by the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings of the Three Caverns’ scriptures and bound in the Three Heavenly Prisons. Their three *hún* and seven *pò* shall be tormented—women’s fourteen *pò* likewise—so they endure every suffering, desiring death yet unable to attain it.\n\nYou Daoists, both men and women, must deeply guard yourselves.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the jiǎyín decade, thirty-nine thousand people shall be executed in the great purge for disrespecting their masters, wrongfully taking lives, slandering Daoists, or pointing out their masters’ names. Such people shall fall into the great purgation of blade, flood, and fire.\n\nYou Daoists and all worldly people must wholeheartedly honor masters and disciples, receive the Three Caverns’ scriptures, transform all beings, and heal the afflicted. In households where illness persists, recite the scriptures to treat them. I shall summon the great ghosts of the ten directions and all deities to question them. If they remain defiant, causing households to suffer incurable illness, unresolved official disputes, or death, the great demon kings and lesser ghost kings shall hack your bodies into ten thousand pieces without mercy.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Daoists serving their masters must revere them as heaven, visiting at the four seasons and eight solar terms to inquire after their well-being. When worldly people face matters, they must act in accordance with the Dharma. If they no longer follow their masters, and their masters no longer attend them, the spirits shall not abide with them. Among people, none are greater than masters; masters are supreme and must be honored as parents. Those who slight them shall be punished by heaven and men, and the demon kings shall not save such sinners.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Daoists who defy their masters shall be examined by celestial soldiers, and their descendants shall likewise fall among the ranks of common ghosts. In the gēngshēn and rénwǔ years, Daoists who slight their masters shall be executed by three hundred sixty thousand ghostly soldiers. Further, in the yǐsì year, forty-nine thousand red-nosed ghosts shall slay three hundred ninety thousand wicked people across the land. By the guǐsì year and rényín epoch, those who do not believe in the Dao or receive its scriptures shall fall into the eighteen purgations.",

If Daoists enter the mountains, the mountain paths are profoundly remote, and worldly people will not see them, left without refuge. Though their original intention remains, there is no means to deliver others. Thus, wise Daoists need not remain in the mountains.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Unless one is a Dharma Master of the Three Caverns, one must not recklessly recite this sutra. Why is this so?",

      "translated_text": "The wrongfully dead number thirty-nine thousand each day, yet the Most High distinguishes their fates accordingly. Should pestilence strike the land in any given year, Daoists who heal the afflicted shall see them recover. If they do not recover, the demon kings Nalü and their ilk shall rend such Daoists limb from limb, showing no mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forth, male and female Daoists must diligently convert the foolish of the world, urging them to receive the great scriptures of the Three Caverns. Let every person receive talismans and registers, wear their name-contracts upon their bodies, and be recorded in the Jade Calendar. Masters and disciples shall transmit the teachings in succession, allowing no disrespect. Should any violate this covenant, celestial soldiers shall execute them, annihilating their households and consigning them to plague and pestilence, where regret shall come too late.\n\nI now dispatch thirty-six thousand crimson riders, each wielding an iron staff, to traverse the land and seize the unrighteous and the five-fold traitors. If the sick are treated by Daoists, the ghost kings shall pardon them. Should they refuse, these ghost kings shall be demoted and punished without leniency.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the rénxū and guǐhài years, eight thousand punishing ghosts shall slay those who fail to honor the Great Dao. By the guǐwèi and jiǎchén years, one hundred twenty thousand red ghosts shall slaughter with blades and warfare—half for mocking those who receive the Dao, disturbing the hearts of others, assaulting Daoists, denying the power of the Dao, speaking falsely while harboring deceit, and slandering masters and disciples. Such sinners shall be cast into the Boiling Ash Hell, the Knife Mountain and Sword Tree, with no hope of release.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the jǐmǎo, bǐngyín, and dīnghài years, eight thousand shall die unjustly. This befalls those who disobey the Dao’s laws, withhold celestial taxes, break vows without repayment, make empty promises, deceive ghosts and spirits to seize others’ wealth, perform no meritorious deeds, and neglect fasting and purification. Though they be Daoists, they kindle no incense, attend no rites, ignore others’ distress, and act greedily without aid. When preparing meals for their masters, they offer impure or inadequate food, or withhold it entirely. Such people shall be cast into the Great Purgation’s Water Prison, trapped for ten thousand kalpas. Even if reborn, their six senses shall be incomplete, repelling others, reduced to the level of livestock. The Great Purgation shall execute them, and the demon kings shall offer no salvation.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Great Patriarchal Masters traverse the world, witnessing the multitude’s ignorance, and thus expound the great scriptures of Samādhi. These scriptures comprise twenty scrolls, transmitted by the Most High. Those who receive them shall behold the Most High face-to-face. Without receiving the divine incantations, none may enter the mountains, nor be called true Daoists, nor heal the sick.\n\nFrom this day forth, masters must first receive these scriptures, for they subdue all great demon kings, lesser ghost kings, and their wives and descendants—all aiding Daoists in converting people and healing the sick. Why? Because all demon kings, too, assist the Most High in transforming the myriad families. Let the wise and virtuous ponder my words.\n\nThe Dao spoke: You people of later generations, failing to honor the Great Dao, instead follow vulgar masters who beat drums to sacrifice to spirits, slaughtering pigs, dogs, and chickens, offering the three pure animals and grass upon the waters, summoning a hundred ghosts, and worshipping wild deities. Such practices breed chaos and evil; the spirits shall not protect you. Your kin shall be struck down, condemned by the Three Officials, subjected to myriad tortures. The dead shall not rest, returning to claim the living, causing deaths great and small, and ultimately annihilating your households. Do not blame the Dao.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Households that honor the Dao must do so with wholehearted devotion. In all endeavors, direct your thoughts single-mindedly toward the Dao. Conduct rites, burn incense, and perform the ten thousand offerings, guided by your master’s fasting and understanding. Do not invite vulgar masters or those who practice heterodox sacrifices into your homes, lest chaos arise, household spirits grow restless, and the living be punished. Such people shall grow wicked, and their families shall be destroyed. This, too, is the Dao’s teaching, awakening those who comprehend.\n\nThe Dao spoke: The world is filled with fools who see no good, recognize no law, and thus perish in great numbers. From this day forth, when someone embraces the Dao and falls gravely ill, summon these Patriarchal Masters and all Daoists to perform rites, set up altars, make offerings, and heal the afflicted. In cases of legal disputes, heaven shall dispatch celestial warriors, the Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, and the great immortals of the ten directions to assist the Daoists, swiftly curing the sick, resolving legal matters, and fulfilling the host’s every desire. Those who act thus shall be elevated through countless ranks, and my golden words shall not be in vain.\n\nShould the sick not recover, the Daoists’ efforts shall be in vain, and the host shall invite disaster, drawing misfortune upon themselves. The demon kings, their wives, children, and descendants, along with the ghost kings, shall execute without mercy all who fail to heal the afflicted.\n\nThe Dao spoke: All demon kings and those afflicted in this world—where Daoists heal them—shall turn and convert the host’s kin, their great ancestors, and all thirty-six generations of forebears, delivering them all. Let the host’s illness be cured, legal troubles dissolved, and every wish fulfilled. I shall summon the hundred ghosts to interrogate the spirits afflicting the sick.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Slaying Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the years of *gengchen* and *renwu*, there shall come Great Thunder Ghosts, one named Nine Prosperities, leading eighty thousand lesser ghosts. Wielding crimson staves, they shall come to slay the wicked, inflicting thirty-six kinds of illness to kill evildoers. There shall also be thirty-nine million Sorrow-Simple Ghosts, spreading red swellings. Eighty-six million nine hundred thousand ghosts shall bring dysentery. Twelve million Red-Eyed Ghosts shall cause vomiting and flux. Ninety million ghosts shall afflict the eyes with pain. Forty-nine million ghosts shall bring chills and fever, sickening and killing the wicked.\n\nAt such time, where a Dharma Master recites the sutras, these ghosts shall perish of themselves. Eighty million trillion Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, together with thirty-nine thousand maidens of the Ten Directions, shall descend as one, bowing their heads to the Most High and declaring: From this day forward, if there be households troubled by illness or official misfortune, and they invite a Dharma Master to recite the sutras, should plague ghosts still linger, we swear to drive them away, banishing them ten thousand leagues, that the living may recover and official entanglements be resolved. Should they not depart, the Enforcers of the Nine Heavens shall slay them without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: Many in the world do not believe in the Dao. If even one receives the scriptures, men and women mock them. A Daoist who feels no shame at the scorn of fools is no true Daoist—the Dao treasures even mockery. The great flood draws near; the year *jiashen* approaches. In *renwu* and *guiwei*, the Great Crows shall slay men. Heaven shall dispatch plague ghosts to spread *qi*, sickening and killing the wicked. Blades and weapons shall clash, and the people shall perish. Insects, snakes, tigers, wolves, water, fire, and poisonous *qi*—all shall be capable of killing men. Yet men remain ignorant, their hearts foolish, slandering the worthy, reviling Daoists, defaming scriptures, and measuring sacred texts. Such sinners shall die suddenly, choking on blood, their throats sealed, their bodies swollen, their voices lost. Heaven and its hosts shall punish them, and none shall be saved.\n\nDaoists, discipline yourselves: guard your speech and restrain your hearts.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this *renchen* year onward, the True Lord shall surely come—the True Lord is not far. Daoists who believe, take heed and study diligently, converting others to receive the scriptures, and immortals shall come to welcome you. In the *renwu* year, plague ghosts shall slaughter men, and the people shall perish utterly. The Most High, moved by compassion, shall dispatch Great Perfected Ones—Cheng Zao, Yan Ping, Wang Jinfang, She Zhou, Zhuang Xuan, Tang Jun, and others—to go among the world and convert men. Those with immortal bones from past lives shall encounter these Perfected Ones. All these Perfected Ones are men of the world, with descendants among the living, and thus the Most High sends them.\n\nThe Dao spoke: By the *renwu* year, great calamity shall come, with waters rising a thousand myriad fathoms. Daoists who enter the mountains shall escape this disaster. From the third to the ninth month of the *renwu* year, the people shall perish utterly. Thirty-seven thousand plague ghosts, heads bent on slaughter, shall come—those who do not believe shall be the first to perish. They shall inflict ninety kinds of illness to kill men. The True Lord shall soon appear, but the wicked shall not see him. Heaven shall send slaying ghosts to punish them, sweeping clean heaven and earth, remaking sun and moon, rearranging the stars, and altering the cosmic order. Divine beings shall govern the law, with immortals as their aides. For five directions and ten thousand kalpas, there shall be no death, no weapons of war. The earth shall be adorned with the seven treasures, clothing and food shall arise spontaneously, no six livestock shall remain, men and women shall all be sages, and the race of wicked men shall cease to exist.\n\nThe Dao spoke: As the great flood approaches, those who know should receive the Three Caverns. Men and women who believe in the Dharma and practice the Dao with single-minded devotion—I shall send one hundred thousand Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens to protect them. When a Daoist converts others to receive the scriptures, converting even one, the hosts of heaven shall proclaim their virtue. But if one’s heart is corrupted and they refuse conversion, the hosts of heaven shall punish them. You all have immortal destiny from past lives, and thus you encounter this sutra. This sutra is profound and wondrous, revered by the heavens above. Honor it, make offerings, and keep it in your homes—plague ghosts shall be driven away, and no evil ghosts shall dare approach.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From this day forward, if there be disputes, official troubles, imprisonment, illness, peril, or the uncertainty of life and death in the world, you must swiftly recite this *Divine Incantations Sutra*. The sutra commands thirty-nine billion great spirits, who shall come to save men, and plague ghosts shall depart of themselves. The Crimson Soldiers of the Ten Directions, the Four Heavenly Demon Kings, and the maidens shall all descend to aid you, ensuring no evil befalls. Where a Daoist recites the sutras, should plague ghosts not depart, the Enforcers of the Three Heavens shall slay them without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: From the *renwu* year onward, the people shall suffer many illnesses, and ghostly soldiers shall roam in bands of thousands and ten thousands, seeking to kill the wicked. When illness strikes, if a Dharma Master comes to save them, I shall also dispatch forty-nine million trillion Good Spirits and Directors of Destiny to drive away the plague ghosts, banishing them ten thousand leagues. Should they not depart, they shall be slain without mercy.\n\nThe Dao spoke: In the *renwu* year, a hundred million Great Crows shall spread *qi*-borne illness, sickening and killing the wicked. The wicked do not believe—what can be done when they die? The Perfected Ones shall rise again, sweeping clean heaven and earth, and plague ghosts shall come to slaughter men. If the people wish to escape disaster, they may, in the ninth and tenth months, establish this fast, pay homage to the Five Emperors, hold a great assembly for one day and two nights, and make repentance. Bow nine times toward the east, three times toward the south, seven times toward the west, five times toward the north. Toward *qian*, *kun*, *gen*, and *xun*, bow twelve times each. Toward the upper direction, bow thirty-two times; toward the lower, twelve times. The heavenly hosts shall descend, record your merits, and inscribe your name in the Jade Register. Alternatively, face east and bow thirty-six times in single devotion—only sincerity matters, and the blessings shall be boundless.",

      "translated_text": "By the *guiwei* year, plague ghosts shall spread seventy kinds of disease to slay men. Should one seek to live, let every household establish this fast, pay homage to the Five Emperors, and bow thirty times toward the south—then shall the plague ghosts flee ten thousand *li* away.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years of *jiazi*, *jiaxu*, and *jiashen*, there shall be eight hundred thousand red-tailed ghosts, named *Duo’a*, each with one head and three tails, their bodies nine *chi* in length. In their hands they hold water, bringing chills and fever to men, spreading ninety kinds of disease to afflict and kill the wicked. Daoists must swiftly convert the people, establishing a quiet abode by the water’s edge beside the Way. Hold a great assembly for one day, offering rites to the Five Emperors and the Controller of Fate, and bow thirty-six times toward the west. The heavenly hosts shall surely descend, recording the names and households of your kin in the Jade Register, sparing them from the rolls of death. Their names shall be inscribed at the Gate of Heaven, their lifespans extended by the Controller of Fate, and they shall never suffer an untimely end.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the years of *jiawu* and *jiachen*, black *qi* shall bring disease to slay men. Eighty-nine myriad plague ghosts shall spread throat obstructions and dysentery to kill. Should Daoists convert the people, receiving the talismans of the Three Caverns, let them hold a great assembly upon the waters in the first, second, and third months—one day and two nights, five watches—gathering to offer rites to the Five Emperors and the Twelve Spirits. Bow twenty-five times toward the north, and the heavenly hosts shall naturally record their names.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year of *jiayin*, there shall be great-eyed ghosts, three *cun* in length, gathering in the thousands and myriads, accompanied by a million red crows, descending into households to slay men. Those who know this must swiftly assemble, fast, and hold rites upon the waters for one day and two nights, five watches of repentance. Bow thirty-six times toward the east, and the heavenly hosts shall surely come to record your name. The plague ghosts shall flee of their own accord, daring not draw near to men. Daoists must swiftly convert the people.\n\nThe Dao declares: The reason for disasters in the *renwu* year is that the gates of the mountains shall close—three before and two behind. Thus, in the years of *xinsi*, *renwu*, and *guiwei*, there shall surely be floods, and the regional lords, the Three Dukes, and the two-thousand-*shi* officials must swiftly turn toward goodness. In this year, plague ghosts shall certainly spread, slaying and eliminating the wicked, and those who do not believe shall perish. Daoists need only convert the foolish, and the heavenly hosts shall record their sincerity.\n\nThe Dao declares: The people of the world do not believe in the Dao and its methods, so Heaven commands plague ghosts to punish them. From this time forth, those of discernment who believe and practice shall be regarded by the heavenly hosts, who shall never allow them to suffer wrong. Wise scholars must propagate this, establishing merit and virtue—take heed!\n\nThe Dao declares: From the *renwu* year onward, thirty-six kinds of plant ghosts shall slay men. When people gather herbs from the wild to eat, the roots, stems, and leaves of these hundred plants contain ghostly toxins, named *Shengru*. *Shengru* and his brothers, a hundred myriad strong, can spread *qi*-borne diseases. On the tenth day of the month, they enter the four limbs and hundred joints of men, turning their bodies yellow and red. These ghosts are three *cun* and seven *fen* in length. In the mountains, a female ghost named *Luoweng* has one consort and two daughters, leading twenty myriad female ghosts. They lurk in the mountains, forests, and waters, lying in wait for men. There is also a female ghost named *Jiangnü*, who once had boundless merit and was destined for immortality, but for her disrespect toward the Three Heavenly Worthies and her failure to honor the Three Masters. When she sees Daoists entering the mountains, her heart harbors no goodwill. Her form is most hideous: her body stands a *zhang* tall, her face black, her eyes vertical, her entire being a sickly yellow-red, her form filthy and foul. Men do not wish to see her; those who do flee far to avoid her. For her disrespect of the Three Matters, she is taught to receive the scriptures and revere her masters, forbidden to slander the Dharma-teachers, to serve with diligence, and not to engage in frivolous conduct or associate with common folk. Those who do not follow this shall be held accountable by the heavenly hosts and condemned to dwell in the mountains for three thousand nine hundred *yi* kalpas—thus she remains trapped. Daoists who receive the secret talismans of the Three Caverns, the true essentials of the Most High, lay the foundation for their future. Yet in an instant, all may be lost. How much better to study immortality and never die through ten thousand kalpas!\n\nThe Dao declares: When Daoists receive the scriptures and find an enlightened master, possessing the fullness of the Three Caverns, they are like the wealthy of the world. Why is this? The greatly wealthy possess vast fields and estates, thousands of servants and slaves, and wealth sufficient for all needs. The poor of the world all labor for them, their desires fulfilled without want or lack. When they go forth, they ride fine steeds, their retinues at ease. When they give alms or make offerings, all is as they wish, for they are greatly wealthy. The great Dharma-teachers of the Dao, inwardly and outwardly accomplished, understand all worldly documents and letters. They are versed in healing, medicine, acupuncture, and moxibustion, and as they move among the people, the myriad folk revere and love them. The great scriptures of the Three Caverns are all complete within them, and the people honor them as they would a Heavenly King or a man of great wealth.\n\nThe Dao declares: Wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness—all are but human conditions. All receive but a single fate; what difference is there? Yet the distinctions between wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, arise from the causes of past lives. Some, having practiced the Dao in former lives, are born in the Central Kingdom with clothing and food naturally provided. Others, having established merit and virtue in past lives, now enjoy great wealth and nobility, their blessings flowing to their descendants. Some, destined for immortality in past lives but not yet ascending, now enjoy great wealth and nobility for that reason. Daoists who are poor yet delight in the Dao—this is because they have studied for long in past lives but failed to convert others, thus they are made greatly impoverished. Those who die without property or livestock have committed grave sins in past lives, failing to perform merit and virtue, disbelieving in the scriptures and the Dao. They come from among the six kinds of livestock, or from the ranks of servants and slaves. Noble Daoists all come from Heaven. Without accumulating goodness in past lives, one shall never become a noble Daoist.\n\nThe Dao declares: In this world, there are many wicked people who do not believe in the Dao. Some receive the scriptures, yet fools mock them, their laughter filling the roads. They slander the worthy, calling the Dao mad and deluded, asking, “What do they seek in the mountains?”",

      "translated_text": "Some claim them to be demonic spirits, feigning virtuous conduct, yet knowing nothing of all things. Man cannot long preserve himself; wealth and honor are fleeting, and cannot be held forever. The young grow old, and the old must inevitably die—three thieves within the body drag one away, yet death comes unperceived. Worldly people know only to covet wealth and cherish wives and children, preferring to commit sins rather than receive the scriptures, seek the Dao of immortality, or attend to their own burdens. Their days pass idly, yet they would do better to study the Dao, for then they would never die through ten thousand kalpas, and might wander together with the heavenly immortals.\n\nThe Dao declares: In the year *renshen*, pestilential *qi* shall spread widely, bringing twenty-three kinds of disease to afflict and slay the wicked. Only those who have received the scriptures, revered the Three Masters, and healed all manner of illnesses shall be noted by the heavenly beings. When the land embraces the Dao and receives the Three Caverns, teaching and transforming the people, then the emperors and kings of the Middle Kingdom shall remain unaware of the myriad evils summoned by the common folk—evils that arise from below without cause or origin, as a hundred ghosts vie to descend. At that time, male and female Daoists must unite in their efforts to remedy this. I shall dispatch thirty-nine hundred million Great Expelling Generals from the ten directions to aid the Daoists in driving them away.\n\nThe Dao declares: Within the Three Realms, fools who do not believe in the Dao and its methods die and enter the ranks of evil ghosts. Thus, these men and women, with their countless ghostly soldiers, come to slay the wicked. From this time forward, when one, two, or three households fall ill with affliction and distress, invite a great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns to recite the scriptures for one day and two nights, performing the five watches, practicing the Way of Nine Ones and the *qi* of Three Fives, and invoking the positions of the ten directions. In every direction, ghosts shall be slain, and even the ghost kings shall not dare to resist. Now, I myself shall send four hundred thousand Red Bow Soldiers and thirty-nine thousand Strongmen of the Nine Provinces to assist the Daoists, driving away all great ghosts, mountain and forest demons, *qi* of the ten directions, and ghostly bandits—all shall be cut down.\n\nThe Great Demon King and lesser kings, following my teachings, shall command the lesser ghosts to aid the Daoists in curing the host’s illness and resolving urgent official matters. Should they fail to comply with the law, the Demon Kings *Weirui* and others shall be slain without mercy. The Dao declares: All Daoists come from Heaven. Though worldly people may be base, ugly, or lowly, if their hearts believe in the Three Caverns, they too come from Heaven. The good are not necessarily fair of form; each has their own karmic causes. Those of upright appearance come from thoughts of goodness. The greatly wealthy come from past lives of almsgiving to the poor. The greatly noble come from building merit and worshiping the Three Treasures. Daoist Dharma Masters come from accumulated study. Thus, those who yearn for the Great Vehicle do so on the foundation of past lives—it is not suddenly attained in this one. If a Daoist aspires to the mountains and marshes, renouncing official life and severing all ties to enter the mountains and cultivate the Dao, such a one is not far from immortality.

Yet fools, bound by desire, refuse to accept the Dao. When floods come, they shall perish; when blades strike, they shall be slain, flowing with the mud, and only then will they regret in vain. When the great expulsion and annihilation occurs, ghostly soldiers shall rage unchecked, causing evil ghosts to slay people throughout the land. But where Daoists practice the scriptures and save others through their recitations, all the great and lesser Demon Kings, male and female heavenly beings, shall come together with the Daoists to heal the sick, resolve official matters, and grant all wishes as the heart desires. Should any defiant ghostly *qi* arise to harm the living, the Demon Kings *Yunzhou* and others shall shatter their heads into sixteen pieces—none shall be spared.\n\nAll is as decreed by the Most High.

When Daoists and female Daoist priests come to save a host, the lesser ghost kings shall swiftly report to the Great Demon King, who shall command the Strongmen to aid the Daoists in transforming people, dispelling illness and *qi*, and resolving all matters. On the day of no other recourse, we shall ascend a thousandfold, ten thousandfold, never betraying the Golden Mouth. Those who do not believe shall be hewn into ten thousand pieces by the Demon Kings and lesser ghost kings—none shall be spared.\n\nHere ends Scroll Nine of *The Most High Scripture of the Wondrous Spells of the Cavern Abyss*.\nHere begins Scroll Ten of *The Most High Scripture of the Wondrous Spells of the Cavern Abyss*.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Slaying Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao spoke: On Mount Xuandu, I expounded the *Great Scripture of Expulsion* to all demon kings. At that time, the Three Heavenly Princes sought the *Scriptures of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials*. Ten Perfected Ones from the ten lands also requested the *Scripture of Samādhi, the Boundless Primal Essence*. Furthermore, immortals from the ten directions sought the *Scriptures of the Yellow Court’s Inner and Outer Two Sceneries of Daoic Transformation*. From the four quarters of Jambudvīpa, thirty thousand Perfected Ones gathered to hear the scripture.\n\nBefore the exposition was complete, they all descended from their seats and said: \"The people of the world do not comprehend the Dao and its methods. Epidemic ghosts slay them, blades and violence oppress them, and the people suffer bitterly. Death fills every household, and none possess the Three Caverns to deliver themselves. We beseech this Dharma Master to disseminate these teachings throughout the world. May the Heavenly Worthy incline toward the transformation of the Dao.\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"Excellent, excellent! Now I shall dispatch thirty thousand Perfected Ones to carry the scriptures and propagate the Dao across the world.\" There was also the Perfected One Nihe, who led thirty-nine thousand followers, bearing the scriptures to spread the teachings throughout the land. The people of the Middle Kingdom all received them. For households afflicted by sudden illness or official troubles, they would transmit the scriptures. Practicing the Dao thrice a day and night, official matters would be resolved, and the sick would recover. Epidemic ghosts lingering without departure would be slain one by one—none would be spared.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"These Perfected Ones share profound karmic ties with the people of this land, and thus they are sent to transmit the scriptures. Those who receive the Three Cavern scriptures all possess prior blessings and karmic conditions, destined for transcendence, and only then do they encounter such teachers. From this day forward, if there are those who uphold and wear these scriptures, I and the heavenly beings shall protect them, and no evil shall befall them.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the *renwu* year, great calamities shall arise. The people will be restless, the six barbarian tribes unsettled, and epidemic ghosts will slay them. One may craft spirit talismans and, according to the method, place them within homes for peace. Three, five, ten, or a hundred households may gather by the water. On a single day, hold a grand assembly, constructing an earthen altar eight feet wide and six feet high. Facing east, perform thirty-six prostrations, paying homage to the Five Emperors. Submit a memorial to the heavenly beings, and they shall surely record your sincere devotion.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the sixth month of the *xinsi* year, the ninth month of the *renwu* year, and the seventh month of the *guiwei* year, eighty thousand epidemic ghosts shall descend to slay the people. The ghost named Wutu Lunna stands seventy *zhang* tall, and they gather in the thousands and tens of thousands. There shall also be great crimson crows, their forms like cartwheels, flying to devour people. If one upholds the Three Cavern scriptures and practices them among the people, these plague crows shall perish. Let the Daoists bear witness to this truth.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The great kalpa draws near, and rulers grow greedy and cruel. They neglect the common folk, who fall into destitution. Corvée labor is unjust, and the people suffer hardship. Wails fill the roads, and corpses cover the fields. Men and women lose their proper seasons, forsaking the Dao and its methods, fleeing in panic. The six barbarian tribes stir in chaos, and great bandits run rampant. They contend with *qi*, fathers and sons grow suspicious of one another. Heaven sends epidemic ghosts to execute these sinners. Their crimes are grave, and they shall face the great flood. The waters shall come soon, yet they remain unaware. Daoist masters and priests, in households where transformation is underway, the Three Heavenly Kings, all immortals, and jade maidens from the ten directions shall come to assist. They shall strengthen the Daoists, and the households they save shall be protected by heavenly beings. Illness and official troubles shall swiftly be resolved, ghostly *qi* shall dissipate, and the sick shall recover. If even a single ghost lingers, it shall be slain—no mercy shall be granted.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The Lords of the Ten Directions declare: 'In this degenerate age, people are mostly wicked, and few believe in the Dao. The world remains untransformed. In the *renwu* year, eighty million epidemic ghosts shall be dispatched, spreading seventy kinds of diseases to slay the people. Those who are aware should establish this fast in every household, bowing to the Five Emperors by the great waters. Face the northwest in prostration, and craft a great talisman to hang above the main gate. Epidemic ghosts shall not dare approach. For households without talismans or those that do not hang this charm, the epidemic ghosts shall harm them. This talisman is guarded by eighty million mighty warriors.'\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"By the *jiaxu* and *renwu* years, there shall be eight thousand nine hundred red-faced ghosts named Mingzhen. Each shall lead thirty-nine thousand lesser ghosts, all wielding crimson staves to bludgeon the wicked. The wicked are many, for they do not believe in the flood or the Dao and its methods, and thus they shall fall into the Three Wretched Realms and Five Tribulations. The Most High, in profound vision, pities all beings and thus delivers them.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In the *renwu* year, for all who hold fasts and transmit the *Scripture of Boundless Samādhi*, epidemic ghosts shall not dare approach. Daoists who have received the Three Cavern teachings and propagate them shall be aided by the Heavenly Emperor and shall never fall into evil destinies.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"From the *guiwei* to the *jiashen* years, three hundred ninety thousand *qi*-crows shall fly over the central rivers, spreading poison into households and afflicting people with water-borne illnesses, which cannot be cured. If one wears talismans and scriptures, and five or ten households build a healing abode by the water, making offerings to the Three Treasures with morning and evening incense and lamps, performing repentance and prostrations, and paying homage to the Five Emperors for one, two, or seven days, the heavenly beings shall surely record your name, and it shall enter the Jade Register.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The great calamity draws near, and the flood shall come soon. Foolish people remain oblivious, idly passing their days. One hundred twenty thousand celestial maidens shall descend to transform them, yet the people shall not perceive it.

The reason they can kill is that the ghosts attach themselves to these things to slay people: entering water, one drowns; entering mountains, one is crushed by stones; felling trees, one is killed by wood; eating meat, one dies by its qi; digging earth, one is buried by soil; entering grass, one is harmed by insects—all these are the qi of unlawful forces.\n\nFrom this day forward, Daoist priests must diligently convert the myriad families, teaching foolish men and women to all devote themselves to the Dao, so that ghosts will not draw near.

All shall follow the oral decree of the Most High, without delay or violation of the statutes. Hasten, as the law commands!\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The people of the world do not believe in the Dao, nor do they receive the scriptures.

Suddenly they depart, and though they may regret it, what use is remorse? Now I dispatch thirty million vajra-warriors from the ten directions to descend as one and assist these Daoist priests wherever they go, pacifying people and severing evil. If any insult, curse, strike, scheme against, or steal from Daoist priests, their souls shall be seized one by one and handed over to the local hells for punishment, so they may know their guilt and understand Heaven’s decree.

When waters surge, they attach themselves to people. Further, there are eight hundred thousand great damp ghosts, named Heaven’s Head, whose masters delight in violence and chaos. Each commands thirty thousand ghostly brigands to enter human dwellings, causing fires that cannot be extinguished. Such ghosts, in the era of great floods, will incite rulers to cruel governance, leading to the slaughter of the people.

Ghostly soldiers shall gather, occupying the lanes and paths of the people, seizing their livestock and beasts, while birds and animals manifest omens of misfortune. People shall suffer official disputes, unjust imprisonment, and wrongful punishment; their fields and silkworms shall fail, and every endeavor shall bring misfortune.

When the Dharma rites were complete, he further summoned the Heavenly Lords of the Three Qi, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Perfected Immortals of the Nine Palaces, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors of the Four Boundless Directions, the Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Nine Lands, and the officials of the Three Realms. Surrounded by the Great Demons of the Divine Empyrean, they soared through the vast sky, returning their chariots to descend upon the Azure Sea’s shore in the Wànlì Heaven, within the Jade Pool’s Chamber of the Wondrous Abyss. Seated upon a five-colored flying dragon lotus throne, he was about to expound the essential Dharma to save and deliver all sentient beings of the Three Realms and Five Paths. Radiating his majestic light, he illuminated the dragon palaces of the one hundred eighty seas in the ten directions, the courts of the Fengdu and Yánggǔ Water Assemblies, the palaces of the Earthly Sovereigns of the Nine Lands and Thirty-Six Earths in the Windy Marsh, the registries of the Perfected Immortals and Great Sages, and the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens—each possessing its own sun, moon, and stars, its officials, people, livestock, birds, beasts, insects, and fish, all deeming themselves secure and joyful. Those without divine Dao, the common folk—husbands and wives, men and women, old and young, high and low—all trace their lineages, bearing manifold names and forms. The Five Agents, yin and yang, fortune and misfortune, suffering and joy, poverty and wealth, nobility and baseness—all are as in this world, with no difference. There are also those who study the Dao and seek immortality, dwelling in mountains and valleys to realize the Dao and attain sagehood.

      "translated_text": "All realms where sages and beings dwell, the karmic retribution of suffering and joy—pray, let the nine murky springs of the netherworld and the grotto-heavens of the Five Marchmounts be revealed, that all in the great assembly may witness the retribution of good and evil, life and death: the ceaseless toil through cycles of filth and flame, drifting through the Eight Gates, self-born and self-perishing, a sight most piteous and grievous.\n\nWithin the great assembly, among the ranks of heavenly beings and earthbound immortals, some possess minor knowledge and insight, soaring through the Five Marchmounts, practicing corpse-liberation, ingesting elixirs, and refining the body. Yet those who do not aspire to the vast wisdom-source of the Numinous Treasure, who have not attained the true quiescence and spontaneous nature of past lives, find their minds unsteady, deluded by falsehoods, swayed by the Six Passions. At times, clinging to their attachments, their four views drift and scatter, above in the heavens or below on earth, where, according to the weight of their evil, they receive their retribution. With no self-exhortation, they endure manifold torments, all filled with dread. Their five spirits mourn in dismay, yet they know not where to turn, each desiring to flee but unable to depart. Gazing at one another, they say: \"Today we have encountered the Sacred Venerable—why must we witness such dire retribution?\" Their bodies and minds tremble in terror, unable to find peace. They can only pray to the Heavenly Venerable, beseeching mercy and deliverance, to expound the primordial origin and restore their original minds.\n\nThereupon, from among the assembly, the Flying Heavenly King of the Nine Heavens, named Samādhi Majestic Virtue, arose from his seat. Radiant with wisdom and adorned with auspicious marks, he possessed the power to subdue all demons. Heavenly spirits, dragons, and ghosts all revered his luminous incantations and skillful expedient means, which brought timely benefit. Leading the perfected ones, the Radiant Net King, and the thirty-six lesser kings of the heavens, including King Gulou, they adjusted their robes and crowns, rose together, and prostrated themselves, knocking their heads to the ground in reverence. Kneeling, they bowed deeply and addressed the Dao Lord:\n\n\"We, having accumulated profound merit, have been graced by the presence of the Great Sage, following the perfected immortals and the lofty and mysterious adepts. Overwhelmed by undeserved favor, we hold our royal positions, each governing the various heavens, our joy and awe intermingled. Today, beholding your compassionate radiance, you have further opened the great amnesty. We have all come, having once received your teachings and decrees, traversing the Three Realms, the thirty-two heavens, and the lands of the ten directions—mountains, forests, sacred peaks, and the dragon palaces beneath the seas, as well as the grotto-heavens and blessed lands. At times we roam the world, at others we enter the human realm, adapting to the customs of the multitudes, sharing in their labors, experiencing the ranks of noble and base, rich and poor. Some dwell in secluded mountains, engaging in cultivation, while others endure the hardships of livestock, insects, water, and fire—there is nowhere we do not enter.\n\nWe have witnessed the common folk, whether learned or unlearned, heedless of past lives, disregarding scriptural teachings. Their judgments are confused, their four views deluded, their Six Passions stained, their minds uncentered. When committing evil, they feel no fear; at times, seized by terror, they cry out to gods and ghosts, seeking deliverance. Some invoke the Three Luminaries, their seven ancestors, or the departed as oaths, racing against one another without end. Families turn against one another, killing without principle. In times of war and famine, relying on brute force, they gather mobs to slaughter the innocent. All beings—humans, ghosts, birds, and beasts—when facing the end of life, cling to their homes, cherish their bodies, their hearts gripped by urgency and longing. Some harbor evil thoughts, others utter wicked vows. Following their original oaths, wherever they reside, wherever blood and flesh adhere, wherever qi is exhaled or eyes gaze, they generate evil karmic causes. Their ethereal souls become habituated, their retribution endless. Having not entered the natural precepts of the Numinous Treasure’s wisdom, how can they escape?\n\nSome believe their refined spirits and subtle mind-and-form are stirred by light, sound, and qi, thus riding the qi of the Six Heavens, the Five Yous, the hundred spirits, the Nine Uglies, the Eight Winds, and the waxing and waning of the Five Agents. They attract calamities: pestilence, plagues, and a hundred diseases arise. Creditors and enemies, slander and defamation—many suffer such encounters. In cities and government dwellings, villages and mountain marshes, wails follow one another, malevolent spirits grow fiercer, and human hearts tremble with fear, giving rise to chills and fevers. From within, cold and heat arise; from without, illness is born. Some pray to shrines and temples, invoking the impure qi of old ghosts who seek blood offerings, falsely predicting fortune and misfortune. Unaware of the true Dao, ignorant of their return, blind to scriptural teachings, they fail to recognize their original nature. Entangled with the hundred spirits, they accumulate sins before the Three Officials, sinking into the Five Paths, self-born and self-perishing, forever without escape.\n\nAt times, the Five Dipper star-officials announce calamities and disasters: floods, droughts, winds, and rains that disrupt the four seasons; blades, wars, and epidemics that bring inauspicious qi. Rulers grow anxious, the people suffer in filth and flame, with no deliverance. Today, by the power of the Sacred Venerable, we have been entrusted as divine kings. Having witnessed all this, we pray for peace and nurturance, to repay your compassion. We shall lead our hosts—the thirty-six lesser kings of the heavens and eighty million beings—to traverse the ten directions, healing the sick, protecting nations, nurturing all life, and spreading the true Dharma. Is this not our shared duty?\"\n\nThereupon, the perfected Radiant Net King led forty-nine billion perfected immortals and their retinues. With them were the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings; the thirty-six Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens, numbering thirty-six billion; the divine kings of great spiritual penetrations and wisdom, the Sentence-People and Divine Youths, totaling eight billion; the Heavenly Prohibition Great Executioners and their soldiers, four hundred thousand; the Heavenly Execution Great Soldiers, four hundred thousand; the Upper Three Heavenly Marshals of the Dark Blade, thirty thousand; the Great Soldiers of the Nine Heavens, ninety billion; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Demon Kings, including King Gupenzi, and seventy-two lesser kings; the Demon King Wulinzi and the Great Demon King Wuliuzi, totaling thirty-six million; the Three Heavenly Jade Maidens and the Great Brahma Maidens, eighty million; the Seven Heavenly Demon Kings, three hundred thousand; the Generals of Rampant Slaughter, eighty million; the Great Demon Kings of Azure Perfection—Zizhen, Konglun, Wuyanshuai, and Chongquan—and thirty-nine kings, including Wuchuan, Lianzi, Wenjixiu, and Fenglianzi, totaling three billion six hundred million; the Three Heavenly Valiant Soldiers, three hundred thousand; and the Great Execution Generals of the Ten Directions, three hundred thousand, who govern the plague demons, dispel disasters and mists, and sweep away defilements.",

Before the Most High, they prostrate themselves with utmost reverence, jointly vowing with the King of Samādhi Divine Mantras to traverse the Three Realms, the earth above and below, and the sacred mountains, rivers, and grotto-heavens. They pledge to eradicate the Six Heavenly and Nine Ugly [Demons], the perverse *qi* of the Five Pestilences and rebellious forces, the harms inflicted upon the people, and all monstrous anomalies, as well as the outbreaks of warfare. \"We possess the power to crush and annihilate them, to transform their hearts, and to sever all demonic *qi*. We only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to show mercy upon us and all our retinues, elevating us to the ranks of the Dao, that we may never regress.\"\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One Weiming declared to the King of Samādhi Divine Mantras: \"We, who now gather and extinguish perverse *qi*, capture ghosts, and cure diseases, must reveal the names of the plague-spreading demons, so that people may recite and invoke them. When these plague-spreading demons hear their own names, they will feel momentary shame and fear. Amidst the assembly before the Three Treasures, they will be humiliated by their own evil and dare not cause harm. Now, by the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion and majestic command, the luminous might of the Three Heavens and Five *Qi*, and the rectifying deities who scrutinize the myriad spirits, we shall disclose their names. I shall instruct the Direct Supervisors and Recorders to itemize and inscribe them, making them known to all devout men and women under heaven.\"\n\nThereupon, the King of Samādhi Divine Mantras universally proclaimed to the Three Realms, the Five Paths, the Six Deng, the Nine Dark Springs, and the curved abodes of all ghostly kings, the Dragon Kings of Water and Earth, the Avian Kings, and all spirits—whether those who neither ascend to heaven nor dwell upon the earth, who roam the world, ride the Eight Winds, mount the *qi* of the Nine Uglies, rely on trees as dwellings, or absorb human essence and pursue blood offerings to incite disasters—commanding them all to reveal their names and dare not conceal themselves.\n\nThereupon, the Ancient Spirits of the Five Directions and the Five Harmful Ghostly Thieves conferred among themselves: \"We are of lowly status in the mortal world, our virtue and power meager, our strength insufficient. We know not where to flee. If we do not submit our names, we shall be reduced to ashes, our retinues plunged into suffering. Beset by calamities before and behind, we can only beg for great compassion, that you grant us leniency. We wish to exhort one another to abandon the mundane, return to the Dao, submit to your teachings, and never again cause harm.\"\n\nThereupon, the Three Heavenly Wicked Kings led four hundred eighty thousand, while the Six Heavenly Wicked Kings and the Three Heavenly Great Wicked Kings numbered nine hundred million.\n\nMoreover, there are eighty thousand one-footed ghosts, each three feet tall, forming bands that dwell in waters to spread *qi*-induced illnesses.

If we now uphold the precepts and cannot roam freely, seeking to preserve others while facing our own deaths—even if we do not die, our bodies will waste away, neither large nor small remaining.

We beseech the Great Kings and peerless divine lords to grant us life.”\n\nThen the Three-Modes Divine Mantra King addressed the ghost kings: “You all, from the past until now, have not believed in the supreme Dao, nor followed the true and correct. Instead, you harm and kill one another, cycling through karmic retribution, your kalpas exhausted, your evil karma not yet spent. Now, in the Nine Dark Realms, you suffer great retribution. If any among your kin could take your place, would that be just? There is no such principle. I, following the Heavenly Worthy, traverse the Three Realms, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the lands of the ten directions, the Five Paths and Eight Gates, witnessing all good and evil as clearly as an echo responds to sound, with no escape. If you now can universally instruct your kin not to harm the people, I will command the people of the world to prepare, according to their means, rare delicacies and fine foods, whether by day or night, in their cities, villages, hamlets, or tranquil dwellings, to set out offerings for you, ensuring you are sated and forever free from hunger and thirst. They will also provide you with clothing, money, and silk, for your use. Without incurring deep enmity, you will receive food and sustenance, your lives fully provided for. Is this not joyous?”\n\nThereupon, the plague-spreading ghost kings and all their kin rejoiced, bowing their heads to the Dao Lord and the Three-Modes Divine Mantra King: “We will follow your teachings and obey your commands.”\n\nAt that time, the Realized One Wei Mingluo and the Three-Modes Heavenly King, bearing the mandate of the Most High, addressed the Five Marchmounts’ Chief Administrators, the Four Seas’ Wardens, and the Village Community Deities: “You must now universally proclaim to all in the world: when the Three Calamities are about to arise and pestilence is set to spread, at the beginnings of the four seasons or in places afflicted by illness, the people—good men and good women, in cities, villages, hamlets, or noble and humble dwellings—should unite in mind and recite together, inviting Daoist masters. They should also have men and women wear talismans and amulets, bathe in fragrant waters, abstain from alcohol, meat, pungent and raw foods, and maintain purity while setting up vegetarian feasts. They should perform prostrations, chant praises, and high-ranking Dharma masters should contemplate the true, donning reverent attire, hanging silk banners and canopies, burning incense and scattering flowers, lighting lamps, and offering thanks. Some may play pure music to summon the hidden and manifest, setting out pure vegetarian delicacies to offer to the Three Worthies and the thirty-six heavens’ spontaneous deities, ensuring all are sated. According to their wealth or poverty and local resources, whether abundant or modest, they should express their sincere devotion, burning incense while circumambulating or sitting upright, silently contemplating, sounding drums, practicing breath control, reciting the names of the ghosts, and invoking the names of our divine kings. They should focus their minds in prostration to the Three-*Qi* Three Heavens’ Sovereign Deities, the Primordial Four Directions, the Thirty-Six Heavens’ Nine Palaces, the Five Marchmounts’ True Officials, and the Correct Deities—spontaneous, perfectly true, the source of great wisdom, responding to circumstances and seizing opportunities, wielding boundless divine power and majesty.

      "translated_text": "The Chapter on the Host of Sages Protecting the Body and Dispelling Disasters\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Five Venerable Lords of the Five Directions, the Nine Celestial Divine Kings, the Perfected Beings of the Ten Directions, and the assembly of divine immortals and sages, saying: \"I have often observed that within the Three Realms and the myriad existences, across the Five Paths and Eight Gates, whether celestial beings or humans, men or women, all sentient beings possessing consciousness and nature—whether in the heavens or hells—experience suffering and joy as cause and effect, like echo answering sound, interdependent and endless. Sinking into the cycles of death and rebirth, they cannot liberate themselves. Yet when reflection arises in the heart, the Dao transforms and awakens, guiding those who turn toward it into the source of the Way.\n\nSince time immemorial, I have acted as a compassionate father and mother to you, the beings of the Three Realms and Five Paths, and all living creatures, teaching and guiding you across kalpas through karmic conditions. At times, I manifest in various forms—bodies, names, titles, voices, and speech—responding to the needs of beings, harmoniously expounding the teachings. The Dharma-voices of the Three Caverns, the ten divisions of wondrous scriptures, and the Dharma-boats I have established universally ferry all beings. I open the celestial vehicle of the Dao, gathering those with aspiration, delivering the multitude from the net of craving, shattering deluded views, and transcending the dualities of emptiness and existence.\n\nYet all sentient beings, lifetime after lifetime, bind themselves through habitual karmic conditions, deluded by false perceptions. Their natures drift, their emotions wander, and in their ignorance and confusion, they obscure their own minds. The Three Corpses and Nine Worms cannot be cast aside; karmic retributions for evil deeds follow them, causing self-inflicted birth and death, chronic illness, prolonged misfortune, bodily and mental afflictions, and the torment of demonic qi and malevolent spirits, which seize upon transgressions and sink them into entanglement.\n\nIf one wishes to dispel these, one must contemplate one’s own body, observing the root of arising and ceasing, the advance and retreat of good and evil. Extinguish thoughts and still the void; contemplate the Three Treasures, cultivate kindness, frugality, and yielding, and turn toward the Seven Perfected. Embrace the Void and the Utmost Real—the Dao within the Dao.\n\nNoble lords and ladies, Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, by your divine names and titles, the Eight Purities of the Great Simplicity, and the Nine Qi Primordial Ladies—arouse the mind, visualize, and adorn your appearance and attire. Follow the flourishing of qi, practice exhalation and inhalation, recite and chant, keeping the mind undistracted. Receive and uphold the precious scriptures and talismanic contracts, hang banners and erect floral offerings, burn incense and light lamps. With tranquil intention, focus the mind and voice to make vows, repenting and atoning for the sins of past lives and the deceased, the karmic roots of transgressions, the retributions of misfortune, and the consequences of past deeds. Gradually, these will be dissolved.\n\nIf a Daoist cultivating immortality recites this scripture, wisdom will open and the six senses will become clear. For chronic or stubborn illnesses, reciting this scripture will fill one with true qi, restoring health. When tormented by demonic or malevolent spirits, recite this scripture while sounding the drum of command, striking bells and chimes. Malevolent entities will vanish, and the hun and shen will stabilize. In hunger, thirst, cold, or heat, or when lodging alone in the mountains or wilderness, recite this scripture, practice exhalation and inhalation, and swallow saliva. Divine medicines will descend, warming the cold and sating hunger. When heaven and earth undergo transformation, the Five Phases announce disasters, the stars and constellations manifest omens, or strange signs appear in the hidden or manifest realms, recite this scripture, and malevolent intentions will submit. In times of war, pestilence, or the spread of death and disease, recite this scripture, and blades will blunt, demonic spirits will perish.\n\nYou, the perfected immortals, entrusted with governance, should proclaim these secret essentials to save the multitude of beings. Let those with aspiration transcend all obstacles and afflictions, attain peace in this life, and later achieve the perfection of the Dao. Extinguish thoughts and forget them; practice benevolence, filial piety, and respect. Put others before oneself, promote goodness and transform evil. Sail the great Dharma-boat into the sea of wisdom, unstained by the Three Bonds, guarding the True Unity. Return the two halves to their original state, merging obscurely with spontaneity.\"\n\nThereupon, the Five Venerable Lords of the Five Directions, the flying celestials of the Ten Directions, and the Seven Sage Immortals all rose, bowed, circumambulated three times, knelt before the Dao, and each presented what they had received in the past—the essentials of the Dao, divine mantras, talismanic recitations, and true instructions. After the Three Dragons, they saved myriad beings. For faithful men and women who, with sincere devotion, humility, and perseverance, have yearned for years with unwavering resolve, spurning wealth to honor the Dao, and those of single-minded sincerity, they should follow the Bright Regulations of the Four Poles and the ancient canons of the Three Primes, purifying themselves for three months. If royal duties intervene, complete one seven-day period or three seven-day periods. Transcribe and secretly transmit these teachings; careless disclosure or disrespect will bring the wind-blade to examine the body. How can one not be cautious?\n\n**The Meaning of the Divine Mantra and Talisman for Protecting the Body by the Mysterious Perfected**\n\nThe Seven Perfected said: \"We have expounded that all the celestial sages who have attained the Dao, from countless eons past, have transmitted and received these teachings. Daoist men and women, regardless of status or age, who uphold, remember, and recite them—when ill, recite; when in disaster, recite; when facing misfortune, recite; when in peril, recite; when in distress, recite; when in sorrow, recite; when in joy, recite.\n\nLong ago, with the Mysterious Perfected, we expounded the scriptures of the Three Treasures, which have already been fully recorded. Those who uphold them to save the world treasure them in their hearts, preserving the body and nurturing nature to attain the Dao of non-action. May the Heavenly Perfected save me, the Orthodox Perfected sustain me, the Utmost Perfected guard me, the Mysterious Perfected protect me, the Wondrous Perfected remember me, the Jade Perfected shield me, the Golden Perfected aid me, the Seven Perfected deliver me, the Nine Perfected preserve me. May the Dharma-mirror illuminate me, the Mysterious Spirit shade me, the Flowing Gold radiate me, the Dharma-vehicle transport me, the Dharma-power defend me, the Dharma-merit perfect me. May the morning lamp shine upon me, its brilliance dazzling me. May the misty qi hasten me, the light of compassion crown me, the cloud encampment cover me. May the Mysterious Sages comfort me, the Dharma King receive me. May the celestial spirits dispel disasters for me, the myriad spirits deliver me from peril, the earth deities ward off evil for me, the myriad emperors eliminate misfortune for me, the host of sages avert calamity for me. May the Seven Perfected grant me bodily peace, the Nine Perfected ensure my longevity.\"\n\n**The Hymn of the Mysterious Perfected for Dispelling Disasters and Averting Misfortune**\n\nThe Golden Perfected descends through empty space,\nDivine tigers inspect the cloud encampment.\nThe Jade Emperor dons green mist,\nThe myriad heavens command divine soldiers.\nThe Nine Stars turn their celestial chariots,\nThe ten thousand demons bind their demonic forms.\nThe Nine Subtleties swiftly send forth mist,\nDivine generals seize malevolent spirits.\nThe Nine Primes open the cloud paths,\nDivine might summons all spirits.\nFlowing Gold hurls its keen blades,\nAll evils dissolve and vanish.",
      "overlap_context": "they seek illusory gods,\nWandering in delusion, chasing external spirits.\nReturn to the land of the True Unity,\nPreserve the people of spontaneity.\n\nAll the immortals, perfected beings, and celestial multitudes rejoice, praising what they have never before heard or seen. They bow twice, prostrate themselves, and chant their assent, vowing to uphold and practice.\n\nThus concludes *The Supreme Dongyuan Divine Mantras Sutra*, Scroll Eleven.\n*The Supreme Dongyuan Divine Mantras Sutra*, Scroll Twelve.",

Witnessing the Great Kings expound the essential Dharma, we rejoice beyond measure at their vow to save all beings, deliver them from suffering, and guide them into the Dao’s gate.**\n\n**\"Formerly, in the land of Sudarśana, we received divine incantations from the Nine Heavens’ Perfected. Though we received their teachings, our minds remained confused and uncomprehending. Only through long devotion, strictly adhering to the oral instructions—bowing, reciting, and meditating without cease—did our spirits accumulate resonance, and the Dao’s qi gradually flow. Gradually, we attained awakening, though our minds’ understanding remained incomplete. Observing our own bodies and minds, we saw only illusory emptiness, growing ever more alarmed and terrified, with nowhere to turn. We then sought the True Sovereign, beseeching compassionate aid.**\n\n**The True Sovereign gazed at us for a long while, eyes smiling, and said:**\n**\"You demon kings, since ancient times, have followed qi’s ebb and flow, transforming at will, believing yourselves eternal.

Deluded and racing, you seek to harm others, yet only harm yourselves, lingering in the Five Paths, bound at the Eight Gates. How could you ever escape?**\n\n**\"If you can cease the Six Passions, follow the Two Existences, cultivate the true Dao’s reality, and refrain from generating thoughts of approach or aversion, then you may enter the Dao. Yet even this ‘entering’ is but a name—only by harmonizing with all dharmas and aligning with nature can you be free from fear.**\n\n**\"Your bodies and minds are but temporary constructs of the Two Existences, fundamentally unreal. How could deluded minds give rise to terror?\"**\n\n**The Sentient Sons said:**\n**\"Now, by the Heavenly Worthy’s grace, you have shown us the path of non-arising, the Dharma of non-mind, granting us the fearless mantra. We shall cultivate with true resolve, free from attachment to approach or aversion, practicing skillfully without defilement, harmonizing our endeavors to guide others into the Dao’s source.**\n\n**\"Now, we proclaim this divine incantation, universally bestowing it upon heavenly beings.

      "translated_text": "**Seize and capture the Nine Shameful Ones,**\n**Slay and extinguish the Six Heavens.**\n**Hands grasp the Three Radiances,**\n**Feet tread the Nine Mysteries.**\n**Eight Mighties spew poison,**\n**Heavenly Soldiers lead the way.**\n**Hunt and examine demonic essences,**\n**Consign them to the Nine Springs.**\n**The Ten Heavens guard the realm,**\n**All things secure in peace.**\n\nThe Three Heavenly True Ones declare:\nIn future kalpas, those who study the Dao and seek truth—devout men and women—whether dwelling in official rank, secluded in mountains and forests, or hidden in court and marketplace, when they encounter the *yang jiu bai liu* (the baleful cycle of nine and six), the juncture of adversity and prosperity, when their destined term arrives and karmic misfortunes converge—blade and warfare, flood and fire, epidemics and famine—when myriad disasters arise, they should steady their minds, guard their resolve, and disengage from worldly affairs. Purify themselves in fasting rites, burn incense and light lamps, or practice visualization and breath regulation, sounding drums and striking bells and chimes. With every four words, bow once; inner and outer spirits unite. From the crown, nine lights emerge, illuminating the Three Realms. The head bears the Seven Stars, the *qi* of the Northern Dipper surging before them. The kingly *qi* and cloudy radiance issue from the Five Viscera, enveloping the body, filling the Eight Extremities, transforming into dragons, tigers, lions, and demon-quelling beasts. They charge before and behind, each conforming to its directional color, exhaling their kingly *qi*, streaming forth golden fire and ringing bells, dispelling calamities.\n\nThereupon, the celestial hosts—supreme sages and perfected immortals—universally descend. The Five Emperors escort them, delivering them from pestilence and disaster, guiding them into the source of the Dao. A universal proclamation is made to future generations: devout men and women who turn their hearts toward this path shall surely attain peace. Cultivate non-action, nurture the spirit, and naturally return. Hold fast to my Three Treasures, focus the mind without distraction. For one seven-day period, two seven-day periods, or even three months, burn incense and bow in worship to the Most High Jade Emperor, the Eight Pure Dao Lords, the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Boundless Heavenly Worthies, the Nine Palaces’ Four Poles’ Supreme Clarity Divine Officials, and the host of perfected saints. Invoke their names, chant and recite their praises. With the three karmas established in goodness, ascend to the mysterious and profound. With sincere intent, one’s self evokes response—**the Dao does not forsake humanity.**\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy extols the Three Worthies in verse, saying:\n**The Great Dao has no coming or going,**\n**Things naturally follow and welcome it.**\n**Silent, it cannot be named,**\n**Yet breath and utterance are its names.**\n**Eternally abiding, without end or extinction,**\n**How could its responsive movement have a beginning?**\n**Now I bow my head in reverence,**\n**Pledging my life to the Jade Emperor’s court.**\n\n**Resplendent with dragon and phoenix script,**\n**Majestic radiance illumines the Ten Heavens.**\n**When resonance departs, it hides in golden registers;**\n**When mechanism arrives, it unfolds jade chapters.**\n**Empty sounds swell in splendid echoes,**\n**Manifesting and concealing as steps and pipes.**\n**Chanting and reciting, singing of nature and destiny,**\n**Harmonizing and flowing into the mysterious and profound.**\n\n**Majestic and towering, the Dao’s honored one,**\n**Whose merit and conduct are already complete and equal.**\n**Descending to receive me,**\n**Masters and guardians escort me side by side.**\n**With compassion, bestowing the Dharma-water of wisdom,**\n**To wash away delusion and confusion.**\n**Forever crossing to the Three Clarities’ shore,**\n**Ever parting from the Five Turbidities’ mire.**\n\nThe Perfected Sovereign then extols the Three Worthies, having uttered his vows, saying:\nToday, for the sake of future kalpas, I employ the Orthodox Dharma to nurture and protect all beings. Adapting to worldly customs, I teach and transform, practicing the Great Vehicle’s Dao, entering all directions in accord with their affairs. Through karmic conditions and retributions, I offer skillful means and benefits. Establishing fasting rites and practicing the Dao, I enable the cultivation of vows and mindfulness. The Four Great Elements unite in virtue, merging into a single source.\n\n**First vow:** May the Great Dao’s profound profundity, the true source’s emptiness and stillness, remain undiminished in wisdom though realms rise and fall.\n**Second vow:** May the Nine Heavens be clear and bright, the Seven Luminaries lofty and luminous. May primordial essence harmonize and descend, nourishing all beings.\n**Third vow:** May the Nine Earths be tranquil, mountains and rivers fertile. May myriad plants ever flourish, sweet springs increase, and all sentient and formed beings receive sustenance and nurturance.\n**Fourth vow:** May the Heavenly Sovereign govern with sagely assistance, the unseen and manifest realms receiving grace. May all things—moving and still—thrive in harmony, preserving the great foundation in abundance and peace.\n**Fifth vow:** May the Three Masters and Dao companions universally attain the Six Penetrations. May virtue fill them, wisdom and eloquence enlighten the ignorant. In hidden or manifest worldly paths, may all things harmonize. May minds remain unstained, bodies soar in the Great Void.\n**Sixth vow:** May the Eight Gates and Five Paths’ karmic retributions be dissolved. May evil destinies be forever severed, good fortunes eternally abide. May souls don crowns and sashes, clothed and fed from the celestial kitchens.\n**Seventh vow:** May crawling, flying, wriggling, and moving beings—born or unborn—be nourished by primordial essence, preserving their natures in peace. May all enjoy joy and prosperity, receiving delight and glory.\n**Eighth vow:** May all be universally uplifted, ascending together to Jade Clarity. With minds fixed on the mysterious and tranquil, may people attain perfection through the Dao. May all return to blessed fruits, the Dao’s *qi* prolonging life.\n\n**The Five Elder Thearchs’ Divine Incantation for Protecting the Realm and Dispelling Disasters for Immortal Aspirants**\n\nAt that time, the Five Elder Thearchs rose together, bowed again, adjusted their robes, composed their countenances, and knelt before the honored one, addressing him thus:\nFor kalpas uncounted, we have followed the cycles, manifesting and concealing, receiving the Numinous Treasure and constantly employing skillful means to deliver and cross over sentient beings, guiding them into the Orthodox Dharma of non-action and spontaneity. We clarify the worldly path’s origins, ends, conditions, and karmic retributions. Formerly, we received the true scriptures, incantations, and oral transmissions, treasuring them in mind and mouth, never daring to lightly disclose or leak their texts. Now, obeying your edict, we dare not conceal them. There is a divine incantation for protection and pacification, the wondrous root of the Three Caverns, the primordial essence of the Nine *Qi*, blending with the hundred spirits. Its inner name is hidden, its merits, wisdom, and radiance complete and luminous. Though mentioned in other scriptures, when practiced and recited, it inwardly mirrors body and mind, outwardly dispelling disasters. Only the lofty perfected sages can fully comprehend its profound principles, which are not revealed to lesser immortals. Later learners and ordinary deluded ones may transmit it only with sincere faith, closing their minds to practice it. Through pure fasting, silent meditation, visualizing the spirit-*qi*, sounding drums, regulating breath, focusing the mind in recitation, the true numina will swiftly descend, immediately enabling ascent to immortality. How much more so for minor calamities and dangers—how could they not be averted? With single-minded sincerity, one’s self evokes response—**the Dao does not forsake humanity.**",

If in future ages you universally succor the multitude of immortals, rescue the distressed, cure illnesses, establish fasts, perform the Dao, recite incantations, and offer reverent worship, you must also prepare cinnabar and vermilion, plain paper and ink, to inscribe and paint divine talismans. Hang them for protection, wear them on your person, present memorials, and summon the divine officials, soldiers, and encampments of the Great Clarity and Great Ultimate to decisively punish malevolent spirits and demonic thieves.\n\nYet the celestial writings are profoundly wondrous—all are the precise forms of the nine *qi* and the names of the hundred spirits, their shifting appearances and signs, the intricate patterns of their script, the hidden rhymes of their inner names. Established by the majesty and power of their numinous efficacy, they can extinguish calamities and anomalies, preserve and nourish primordial harmony, and guard the twelve double-hours, gates and doors, wells and hearths, latrines and cesspits.\n\nThe reason is this: when ordinary people dwell in the world, they may become confused and lost, not yet having entered the Orthodox Unity’s covenant of awe-inspiring might, the numinous treasure’s fountain of grace. Their natures and emotions drift and taint, their minds unsettled, deludedly giving rise to fear. The Six Heavens and Nine Uglies, perceiving their hearts in motion, thereby generate disasters and harms. Thus, one must employ divine talismans for protection, true *qi* for defense, aligning with spontaneity to attain stability.\n\nFor those suffering illness, they should also swallow the talismans, cultivate visualization, recite the incantations, perform the Dao thrice daily, face north in the courtyard, invoke the divine soldiers, present memorials and petitions, burn incense and light lamps, hang silk banners and floral streamers, circumambulate while singing hymns. The majestic rites of the Dharma-realm should fully accord with the Three Records, the Four Poles’ Luminous Perfection, the precepts, statutes, and laws. To lightly divulge or negligently profane them brings calamity extending to the nine generations.”\n\nWeiming Luo, the Perfected King, stepped before the great assembly, bowed twice, and knelt. Raising a jade table, he opened a golden casket, burned a hundred precious incenses, sounded the drum, and held his breath, demonstrating the ritual norms to the assembly. He unfolded the jade tablet and inscribed it to transmit the announcement.\n\nThereupon, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords of Julou and others all rose, bowed twice, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “From former times until now, we have received the essential incantations of the Dharma’s savor and truth, all of which we have expounded. Now, may the great assembly of heavenly beings, humans, and divine immortals, each in their own lands, rescue and deliver those in suffering, exalt the sagely Dao, protect the state and pacify the people, broadly propagate the great Dharma, and universally deliver the boundless.\n\nWe clearly proclaim to the men and women of future generations and the latter age: those who can turn toward and single-mindedly believe should receive the command, silk, cinnabar, and pigments, establish vows and fasts, and report as the statutes of the Luminous Perfected prescribe. Also offer precious, fine, and sweet fruits—the flavors we present—to the Five Emperors, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords, and the venerable divine lords of spontaneity, to seek their desired blessings.”\n\nThe various Perfected Kings, unable to contain their joy, with different bodies but one mind, sang in praise:\n\nWisdom’s abyss, deep and clear as the sea,\nDharma-water ever brimming full.\nSilent, no one calls its name,\nYet when moved, it bears merit’s fame.\nThe nature of form stirs the divine incantations,\nRevealing the *Dongyuan* scriptures’ depths.\nHarming none, aiding all beings,\nThus moved, the Worthy manifests form.\nDescending to transform the lands of Fangzhu,\nAscending in flight to the Jade Capital’s Dao.\nNeither coming nor going,\nNeither perishing nor arising.\nResplendent with dragon-phoenix script,\nSeparating and uniting, tracing divine talismans.\nWorldly sentiments distinguish noble and base,\nBut the Dao makes no distinction between wise and foolish.\nWith sincere heart, blessings arise,\nThrough divulgence and negligence, fortune departs.\nGood and evil are not others’ opposites,\nRising and sinking accompany the self.\nIn the end, all return to our Three Treasures.\nDark grace may yet support.\nHard to encounter, now we attain it—\nThe sagely Dao’s incantations and talismans.\nA lifetime’s joy and fortune,\nTen thousand kalpas’ finest affinity.\nSentient beings receive as they feel,\nUnmoved hearts do not meet transmission.\nThe Eight Gates sever karmic retribution,\nNine generations together ascend.\nDispersing and gathering, rejoicing in song,\nBowing before the Imperial Lord.\n\nAt the Dharma assembly’s conclusion, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Five Elders to harness their chariots to the ten directions. The divine immortals all rose and bowed twice. Transforming into Eight Radiance bodies, cloud carriages flying like wheels, resplendent and dazzling, the celestial harmony resounded. Heavenly perfected ones led the procession, riding the void, ascending to the Jade Clarity.\n\nThus concludes the twelfth scroll of the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Incantations of the Abyssal Cavern*.\nBeginning the thirteenth scroll of the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Incantations of the Abyssal Cavern*.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter of the Dragon Kings**\n\nThe Dao spoke: Long ago, upon the Three Heavens, I observed the world below. I beheld the myriad heavens and earths, where pestilential qi spread unchecked. People suffered from illness, lands endured scorching droughts, and the five grains failed to yield. In twos and threes, none knew what to do.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy rode upon a five-colored cloud, descending upon the lands. Manifesting great divine power, he radiated luminous brilliance, accompanied by over seven thousand two hundred Dragon Kings, immortal youths, and jade maidens. Proclaiming the true Dharma, he universally delivered all beings. A great deluge poured forth, timely and sweetly moistening the earth.\n\nYou must not harbor disbelief, lest calamity sink nine generations of ancestors, their suffering souls bound within the offices of ghostly officials, never to escape for a hundred kalpas or a thousand rebirths. But if you diligently cultivate the heart, receive, uphold, recite, and chant, the merit will be profound and far-reaching. The people will know no disaster, each extending their years in longevity, free from harm.\n\nThe Dao spoke: When a kingdom faces peril, weapons clash, people devour one another, heaven and earth quake, and the sun and moon lose their light—then in the auspicious direction of blessings and virtue, within palace gardens or where springs and pools reside, establish the positions of the Nine Dragons and the forms of the Five Sages. Turn your thoughts to this sutra, and pay homage to the August Emperor of the Void to pacify the realm. The Heavenly Dragons will respond: demonic vapors will vanish of themselves, warfare will cease, ruler and ministers will follow the Dao, dragon virtue will aid them, and the world will know great peace, ever abiding in prosperity.\n\nAt that time, the assembly of immortals, hearing this exposition, all received benefit and universal grace. All sentient beings bowed in reverence, each vowing to receive and uphold it.\n\n**The Supreme Abyssal Summons of the Myriad Heavenly Dragon Kings, Most Wondrous Chapter**\n\nEast: Azure Emperor, Azure Dragon King\nSouth: Vermilion Emperor, Vermilion Dragon King\nWest: White Emperor, White Dragon King\nNorth: Black Emperor, Black Dragon King\nCenter: Yellow Emperor, Yellow Dragon King\nSun and Moon Dragon Kings\nConstellation Dragon Kings\nHeavenly Palace Dragon King\nDragon Palace Dragon King\nHeavenly Gate Dragon King\nYama Dragon King\nHell Dragon King\nHeavenly Virtue Dragon King\nEarthly Virtue Dragon King\nHeavenly Being Dragon King\nFlying Being Dragon King\nLotus Dragon King\nFlower Grove Dragon King\nFive Marchmounts Dragon King\nMountains and Rivers Dragon King\nAdditionally:\nDemon-Slaying Dragon King\n*Kāla* Ghost-Swallowing Dragon King\nLesser Auspicious Dragon King\nGreater Auspicious Dragon King\nGolden Radiance Dragon King\nGolden Hue Dragon King\nYang Qi Dragon King\nYin Qi Dragon King\nMedicinal Dragon King\nLion Dragon King\nRealm-Preserving Dragon King\nDwelling-Preserving Dragon King\nWealth Dragon King\nWell and Hearth Dragon King\nGold and Silver Dragon King\nTreasure Dragon King\nStorehouse Dragon King\nProsperity Dragon King\nFive Ridges Dragon King\nFive Grains Dragon King\nGolden-Headed Dragon King\nClothing and Sustenance Dragon King\nOfficial Rank Dragon King\nOfficial Emolument Dragon King\nRiver and Sea Dragon King\nCloud Sea Dragon King\nHuai Sea Dragon King\nMountain Sea Dragon King\nAbyssal Sea Dragon King\nLand Dragon King\nPrefecture and County Dragon King\nCity Dragon King\nSpirit Altar Dragon King\nWind Earl Dragon King\nVibrating Dragon King\nCloud and Rain Dragon King\nGreat Rain Dragon King\nScattering Water Dragon King\nHeavenly Rain Dragon King\n\nThe Dao spoke: I declare to all beings—when reciting the divine incantations and wondrous sutras of the Heavenly Dragon Kings I have expounded, you must burn incense and chant for three days and three nights, universally summoning the Heavenly Dragons. In times of drought, rain will fall. Though thunder and lightning arise, no harm will come. The dragons will descend, fulfilling every wish. Whether seeking blessings, virtue, longevity, official rank for sons or daughters, healing for the people’s illnesses, protection for dwellings in peril, resolution of all enmities, or legal disputes—none will fail to prosper.\n\nAs for you, demon kings and all wayward ghosts: if you hear this sutra and do not depart, your heads will shatter into seven pieces, your roots utterly severed. Those this sutra subdues will submit; those it dispels will retreat.\n\nIf lands, cities, towns, or villages frequently suffer from heavenly fires, let every household first inscribe the names of the Four Seas’ Dragon Kings and place them at the four corners of their dwellings. Then, burn incense and uphold the recitation, and the Water Dragons will come to guard. The Eastern Sea Dragon King of the East, the Southern Sea Dragon King of the South, the Western Sea Dragon King of the West, and the Northern Sea Dragon King of the North—each will soar through the void, manifesting divine transformations. In an instant, they will spew ten thousand *shi* of water. The fire spirits, upon seeing it, will plunge a thousand feet into the earth. There is also the Great Water Dragon King, who presides over the center, guarding and pacifying each direction, sweeping away inauspiciousness.\n\nThe Dao spoke: For households of good men and good women who serve the Dragon Kings—if you inscribe the name of the Ever-Peaceful Dragon and place it within your storehouses, offering pure water and fresh fruits in timely devotion, or on the days of the new and full moon when dragons are worshipped, recite this sutra and invoke the Dragon Kings—your home will prosper in wealth, free from loss, your storehouses overflowing. The efficacy of this sutra is beyond measure.\n\nAt that time, the fourfold assembly, hearing this exposition, rejoiced immeasurably. Eighty-four thousand Dragon Kings leapt forth as one, heaven and earth trembled, divine dragons gathered, and a great deluge poured forth, universally delivering all beings. All heavenly and human beings simultaneously praised it, bowing their heads in reverence and vowing to uphold it.\n\nThe Dao spoke: By decree of Wang Lu and Li Zhong, the Daoist priestesses and female officials of Nanhai and Hailing, along with all Daoist followers, are to be universally informed. Since my transformation began fifty-three years ago, I have been sent by the Most High to traverse the Five Marchmounts, converting the ten directions, circling the world without fail, desiring to inaugurate a reign of Great Peace under a non-acting emperor. Yet the hearts of people today are shallow: the good are few, the wicked many.\n\nFrom this time forth until the *renwu* year, I shall dispatch seventy-two disciples to roam the world, teaching and transforming all beings, bestowing upon them the Dao’s qi.",

      "translated_text": "For these people, greedy for wealth and sensual pleasures, falsely claim to be sages and worthies, deceiving and misleading the common folk—though they speak a thousand words or ten thousand, not one response shall they receive. Since the *jiazi* year, I have eliminated them by the Law, and of the remaining thirty-six, I now bestow upon them the Dao’s *qi*, that they may protect and sustain the ruler and the people. Exhort them to goodness—revere this, revere this!\n\nAt that time, the world’s fate pressed close, and evil men abounded. In the *jisi* year, on the third day of the third month, I dispatched ghostly soldiers from the ten directions to drive out the wicked, beginning at Huayin’s Western Marchmount. Now they have reached Mount Heng’s Southern Marchmount, erasing all traces, leaving not one in ten, their corpses strewn by the myriad, unburied and unhidden. Do you yet know this?\n\nFrom this time forth, every third day of the third month, I shall send a million ghostly soldiers from Mount Song, driving out the wicked between the lands of Nan, Ji, Ding, Guo, Huang, Bao, and Han, erasing all traces, leaving not one in ten. Now, with Mount Heng’s Northern Marchmount, I fear all shall be swept away. I tell you now: of foolish scholars, fewer than a hundred can see, and fewer than a thousand can act—yet they claim to know the distant past. How pitiable are the deaf and blind among the common folk!\n\nFrom Qing and Qi southward, to Yangzhou and north to Yan, these are lands of fortune. You must diligently perform purification rites, sweep and purify the altars—do not treat this as ordinary. In the *jiashen* year, I shall unleash a great flood to scour away the bones of the wicked. At that time, the myriad people shall be swept away. I now speak this especially to you, the faithful, that you may each know and instruct the Daoist followers, teaching and admonishing the disciples of the Law. Apply yourselves earnestly—do not treat this as ordinary.\n\nI see into your hearts: you have taken the incense and lamp offerings to feed your families and sustain yourselves, not as those of true devotion. I admonish you now—each of you must reform your hearts, diligently bestow charity upon the poor and needy, and never use wealth gained by unrighteous means. Waste nothing without reason. Poverty is not due to lack of fortune, nor is wealth the result of cunning—all is by my power, descending the Dao’s *qi*, my numinous might overshadowing, bringing it to pass.\n\nI come from the void, formed of accumulated *qi*, my movements leaving no trace, my presence casting no shadow, my hearing producing no sound, my sight taking no form. At times, I rise three feet from the heavens, or hover three feet above the earth; at others, I float three feet above men’s heads, witnessing all within the great earth below—what is there I do not see? How could you know whether my spirit is near or far? I do not reach the heavens above nor touch the earth below, drifting beside the Gate of Heaven and the Starry River. What do I seek? What do I desire? Only this: the myriad people are forlorn, the great flood approaches, a thousand calamities converge, driving out the wicked factions—ten thousand deaths, no life spared.\n\nWhen Great Peace emerges, heed my drum’s call. I shall instruct you, the Daoist priests and priestesses, and all of good heart among the various peoples. I know the celestial tribulation draws near, its time appointed. The year’s fate presses close—each of you must apply yourselves earnestly; do not treat this as ordinary. In the *renshen* year, I shall send forth a hundred diseases to purge the wicked.\n\nI speak now to those of good heart, that all may know. In the *guiyou* year, I shall dispatch three disciples, bearing a million talismans of divine truth, to traverse the Five Marchmounts. Those who receive these talismans shall be untouched by the myriad disasters, and no hundred ghosts shall draw near. In the *jiaxu* year, there shall appear a kind of yellow-robed messenger, indistinguishable from the wicked. You must tend to your incense and lamps diligently—do not be deluded by those who share your practice, mimicking this form. Before the incense and lamps, you shall witness Great Peace.\n\nI proclaim to the Daoist priests and priestesses within the Five Marchmounts and the Nine Provinces: at the end of the nine calamities, when the hundred-and-six count is exhausted, men and ghosts shall contend, the evil age shall be hard to endure. Teach one another, that all may turn to goodness. On the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth days, diligently perform purification rites, sweep and purify the altars—let nothing be lacking.\n\nOn the first day of the first month, I shall dispatch a million ghostly soldiers to drive out the wicked factions. Thirty thousand ghostly soldiers, each wielding a red staff, shall slay the evil upon the roads. Another fifty thousand ghostly soldiers, each bearing yellow medicine, shall inflict heart pains and epidemics, killing only those of wicked hearts. Seven thousand ghostly soldiers, each holding yellow medicine, shall spread plague—those afflicted shall find their limbs withered, unable to stretch. Six thousand ghostly soldiers, each bearing green medicine, shall roam the world—those stricken shall choke, their mouths sealed, unable to speak, until their lives end. Ten thousand ghostly soldiers, each holding white medicine, shall wander the world—those who contract this sickness shall suffer dizziness and deafness, dying upside-down. Twenty thousand ghostly soldiers, each bearing black medicine, shall roam the world—those afflicted shall burn with fever, rave in madness, and die without sleep. Five thousand ghostly soldiers, each holding red powder, shall traverse the world—those who fall ill shall die suddenly, unable to speak.\n\nA million child-spirits, each wielding thunder chariots and lightning bolts, shall I dispatch every third day of the third month to slay the unrighteous. Do you, the people of the world, know how many I command to be killed in a single day? When the hundred disasters converge and deceptions arise, if you wish to survive these calamities, then before the incense and lamps, do not trust those who deceive. I send forth thirty-six disciples to roam the Nine Provinces and Five Marchmounts, teaching and transforming all people. I bestow upon them the Dao’s *qi*—my disciples’ heads shall bear a sign: not yellow but red, not green but white. If you see their light, revere my gate with a single heart.\n\nAfter Great Peace, a non-acting emperor shall govern the realm. Then shall there be thirty-six thousand who become immortals.",

How could the foolish or wise know me? Sometimes I appear as an infant child, sometimes as a white-haired elder. By day I conceal myself, by night I roam, yet the hearts of the myriad people do not follow.\n\nBefore Great Peace is fully revealed, the sea’s treasury shall open the great flood.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on the Hymn of the Ghost-Slaying Steps**\n\nThe Dao spoke, saying to the Perfected One of Luminous Net: \"From this day forward, if any person of good heart suffers misfortune or plague, they should invite a Daoist of the Three Caverns to recite the scriptures on their behalf. They must abstain from meat and pungent foods, forsake carnal desires, purify body and mind, and focus their thoughts in silent recitation, allowing no stray thoughts. They must constantly visualize the Five August Emperors, the spirit officials, the generals and attendants, and the guards on either side. The sponsor of the fast must devote themselves wholeheartedly, prostrating with reverence. The Dharma Master must summon the Perfected Immortals and Heavenly Worthies to descend and deliver the people from their afflictions. If their hearts are not sincere, their offerings of silk and treasure will be wasted, and the immortals and sages will not protect them. But if they follow my decree, they shall forever remain free from harm.\n\n\"Upon reciting this precious scripture once, the Heavenly Soldiers shall descend, and the Demon Kings shall be bound. If they do not heed my words, the Demon King Wulinzi shall have his head shattered into three hundred pieces.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Luminous Net entreated the Five Emperors and the divine immortals with their armies to descend into the ritual arena and search out and capture the demonic thieves.\n\nThe Azure Emperor of the East, Lord of the Nine Yi, with the Azure Spirit General and his host of eighty-one times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the eastern realm, all descended together to seize the azure plague spirits of wood in the east.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor of the South, Lord of the Eight Man, with the Vermilion Spirit General and his host of sixty-four times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the southern realm, all descended together to seize the vermilion plague spirits of fire in the south.\n\nThe White Emperor of the West, Lord of the Six Rong, with the White Spirit General and his host of thirty-six times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the western realm, all descended together to seize the white plague spirits of metal in the west.\n\nThe Black Emperor of the North, Lord of the Five Di, with the Black Spirit General and his host of twenty-five times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the northern realm, all descended together to seize the black plague spirits of water in the north.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor of the Center, Lord of the Three Qin, with the Yellow Spirit General and his host of nine times ten thousand, along with the divine immortals and spirit officials of the central realm, all descended together to seize the yellow plague spirits of earth in the center.\n\nAll shall be swept away and utterly destroyed, so that the afflicted may recover from their illnesses and the people enjoy peace and health.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High, let the Five Directions’ divine generals slay the ghosts and pacify the people. Such is the law.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"The common folk and officials, the gate wardens and household guardians, the left and right pavilion chiefs, all the high and low ministers and grandees, the thirty myriad spirits within the home, the Three Generals who guard the dwelling, and the Broad Han upon the roof—let the master of the household, together with all its members, be freed from all misfortune: the nightmares and disorienting dreams, the frequent apparitions of malevolent spirits, which have persisted for so long without respite.\n\n\"Moreover, it is feared that the ancestors of the household—those who have passed before or after, the seven generations of forebears and the nine lineages of descendants—may have encountered inauspicious days or ill-fated hours, transgressed against Heaven and Earth, or offended the Three Luminaries, the great deities of the ten directions, and the Perfected Sages of the eight extremities. Thus, the household suffers from illnesses great and small, calamities arising in due season, curses and schemes, locusts and drought, epidemics among the six livestock. Therefore, the scriptures are recited, memorials presented, and offerings made to dissolve disasters and resolve all matters.\n\n\"From thirty-six generations past, the demonic thieves of the mountain forests and earth altars, the malevolent spirits of household shrines and temples, the thousand ghosts and ten thousand specters, the inner and outer kin of the family—all shall receive the merit of the scriptures, their calamities dissolved and resolved. From this day forward, after the recitation of the scriptures, they shall receive ten thousandfold blessings. Their wishes shall be fulfilled, their careers advanced, their desires granted. The sick shall recover, dreams shall be auspicious, legal entanglements resolved, plagues and banditry shall not arise, ghostly *qi* shall vanish, and evil spirits shall be extinguished.\n\n\"If you, demon kings, do not follow my teachings, your heads shall be shattered into one hundred and twenty pieces.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"From this day forth, as the Three Caverns spread their transformative influence, if any Daoist can establish a fast and recite the scriptures for the afflicted, present memorials, and perform offerings, wherever the Dharma Master conducts the ritual, evil ghosts shall hear of it and flee of their own accord. Young and old alike must devote themselves sincerely, prostrating toward the north to listen to the Dharma Master’s chanting of the hymns. When demonic spirits hear it, they shall naturally retreat far away, driven off for ten thousand leagues, never daring to return.\n\n\"Children, be earnest and reverent, and listen with respect:\n\nThe Azure Emperor of the East,\nGoumang, how vast and green!\nPeople grow like a hundred grasses,\nFragrant by nature as the seasons turn.\nThe good ascend to Heaven,\nThe wicked fall into boiling cauldrons.\nLike seeks like by its *qi*,\nUnlike cannot long endure.\nOutward discord brings no harmony,\nBut accord is like the mandarin ducks.\nDisdain leads one far from the Dao,\nReverence ascends to Heaven’s halls.\nHonor the master as sun and moon,\nFilial piety moves the ten directions.\nThose who disbelieve the Three Caverns’ law\nShall tread blades of frost for ten thousand kalpas.\nSeven generations sink into the Nine Darks,\nEndless night stretches on.\nAlas for the foolish mortal—\nDeath brings calamity to descendants.\nThose who slander the Dao of immortals and sages\nShall suffer hardship for ages unending.\nDo not believe? Then know this:\nThe unrighteous find no peace.\nPractice goodness, ascend to Heaven’s halls,\nReceive the registers, join the ranks of immortals,\nAnd behold the August Most High.\nChronic illness breeds evil ghosts—\nInvoke the sacred hymns.\nSeven generations of ancestors shall be freed,\nGazing upon the light of sun and moon.\nEstablish fasts, aid the poor,\nDrink the jade pool’s nectar.\nHeavenly spirits all descend,\nCommanding every king:\nEach must restrain their ghosts,\nLest they act with reckless force.\nSeize the venomous, capture the myriad ghosts,\nCrush the wicked and conceal them.\nToday, slay the evil ghosts,\nSubmit to the Azure Vastness.\nPlagues flee ten thousand leagues,\nGhosts depart, people thrive.\nRebellion and compliance each take their place,\nBlessings bring eternal prosperity.\nDivine soldiers heal the sick,\nDisciples pay homage to the East.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor of the South,\nYandi, how deep and distant!\nThe jade consorts of the Three Heavens,\nPerfected immortals descend to wander.\nHeaven and Earth endure long,\nHuman life is brief as morning dew.\nThe mysterious transforms the bright world,\nYet fools do not cultivate.\nThe deluded do not know the Dao,\nAnd the Dao cannot save them.\"",

the gates of heaven.\nEach bows with reverence,\nAs the immortals descend with great mercy.\n\n**The Hymn of the Queen Mother of the West:**\nThe world’s customs are tangled,\nSelf-entangled in their own snares.\nThe Three Caverns’ teachings spread,\nYet fools do not heed them.\nSeeing the Dharma, they do not cultivate,\nCreating evil causes and conditions.\nGreed harms the present,\nEnsnared by the ten evils.\nThe three paths and eight difficulties,\nThe five destinies and ghostly realms—\nToday, they establish blessings,\nThat seven ancestors may ascend to heaven.\nThe living endure long,\nTurning toward the ten heavens.\nJade maidens descend,\nBestowing grace upon you.\nDisciples bow thrice,\nReceiving a thousand springs of fortune.\n\n**Three Hymns of the Jade Maidens’ Journey Through the Three Heavens**\n\nFar beyond the three realms,\nThere lies the Terrace of the Immortals’ Palace.\nCountless perfected beings,\nRiding dragons and phoenixes, arrive.\nThe Three Caverns transform the foolish,\nDivine incantations dispel great calamities.\nThe Five Emperors summon demon kings,\nBinding evil and restraining ghostly bones.\nShould any dare to test this,\nHeavenly soldiers will slay their ghostly forms.\nJade maidens chant to the ten directions,\nGhosts die, and people live anew.\nAll gods hear the wondrous Dharma,\nSeven ancestors ascend to the heavenly court.\nAll attain liberation,\nTogether roaming the Purple Phoenix City.\n\nThose who uphold the Dao and meet the immortals,\nKeep their hearts upright.\nContemplating goodness, they ride dragons in flight,\nWhile the faithless fall into darkest night.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, they dwell in gloom,\nGone forever, never to be reborn.\nIf you revere the passage through the three calamities,\nReceive the wondrous scriptures from your master.\nThe Great Dao is most profound,\nRevere your master as the sun and moon,\nFilial piety moves the heavenly spirits.\nThose who disbelieve

divine ordinances:\nThe Dao declares: From this day forward, in all lands under heaven, should any suffer from plagues year after year, it is the demon kings—Wumingjiu and their legions—who bring calamities, roaming the world to afflict the people, accompanying the wandering souls of seven generations of ancestors to spread pestilence and slaughter the populace. If any of virtuous heart, moved to preserve and protect, invite masters of the Three Caverns to establish ritual altars, recite scriptures, chant incantations, present memorials according to the Dharma, and hold fasts and offerings, praying to the Five Emperors and the immortals, their merit shall be boundless. They shall dispel plagues and bestow blessings, their merit unmatched. The wandering souls of seven generations shall ascend to the azure heavens, the nine lineages of ancestors shall be liberated in the Vermilion Mound. They shall transcend the three realms, attaining freedom in the six voids. The people shall enjoy peace and prosperity, the old and young shall live in tranquility. Their lifespans shall be extended, and they shall attain immortality and transcend the world. Fields shall yield double harvests, silkworms shall spin eightfold threads. Graves and homes shall be harmonious, livestock shall multiply. Public and private affairs shall be serene, disasters and pestilence shall vanish. The lord and king of the realm shall surpass Yao and Shun in virtue. The golden branches shall flourish, the jade leaves shall remain evergreen. The world shall know great peace, weapons shall be stilled. Governors and magistrates shall rule with the Dao, bringing peace to the people. No calamities shall arise, no rebellions shall occur. The four serpents shall withdraw their venom, the six thieves shall cease their depredations. We now transmit this scripture to dissolve your disasters and avert your sufferings—why not receive it with reverence? Those who receive it devoutly shall gain boundless blessings. But those who deceive their masters, betray the Dao, disobey the scriptures’ words, commit the five rebellious acts, are unfilial, kill the innocent, exploit the orphaned and poor, or harm the good and virtuous—such sins shall pile high as mountains and seas. Whether in past lives or present, for men and women, old and young, high and low, from the age of seven onward, none shall escape these grievous sins.",

      "translated_text": "Now, therefore, we burn incense to make universal repentance, beseeching that all sins be swept away and no punishments be meted out. From this moment after the turning of the scriptures, you ghostly multitudes, together with the demon kings and their legions, and all spirits and specters, shall follow the directives of this true scripture. Should any fierce or overbearing ghostly brigands defy our edict, the Ten Heavenly Divine Generals shall be dispatched to cut them down at once, leaving no descendants.\n\n*Recite urgently as per the* **Taishang’s Oral Command to Slay Ghosts and Pacify the People.**\n\n**The Fourteenth Scroll of the** *Taishang Dongyuan Divine Incantations Sutra* **concludes.**\n\n**The Fifteenth Scroll of the** *Taishang Dongyuan Divine Incantations Sutra*\n**The Step of Lu: The Release from Torment**\n\nThe Dao speaks: We cannot bear to witness you, the people of the world, so shallow in fortune and virtue. From the moment you emerged from the womb into this world, from the age of seven when you learned to speak, every gesture, every word, every thought has been tainted by the five poisons, while the six thieves vie for dominance. Never have you shown kindness; only evil arises, and you delight in killing. Thus, the Three Corpses record your deeds, and the Seven Ghosts inscribe your names. On every *jiazi* and *gengshen* day, they report to the Heavenly Courts, where your sins accumulate to three thousand. The celestial ledgers issue decrees to the Central Dipper’s bureau, commanding the star officials of your fate to seize your three hun and seven po souls and consign them to the Earth Prison of Mount Tai. From there, your case falls into the Register of Life and Death, and your grave offenses are transferred to Fengdu, plunging you into the Twenty-Four Hells. Even if your sins are not compounded, you shall remain in the Eighteen Hells of Mount Tai, lashed day and night, tormented without cease. Once your confessions are fixed and your records made clear, the hell wardens raise their forks, and the clerks drag you forward. The Great King Yama rages, for your crimes admit no pardon. Each is measured by its statute, and you must repay your karmic debts. Some shall be reborn in the heavenly realms, some in the earthly, some among humans, some as ghosts, some as beasts. Some shall live, some fall ill; some shall die, some linger in death’s threshold. Some shall be sated to death, some starved; some scorched, some frozen; some drowned, some burned; some crushed by earth, maimed by wood, or slain by metal blades. Some shall perish from snakebites, tiger maulings, or the jaws of dragons and turtles; some from the goring of oxen, the trampling of horses, or the bites of dogs. Some shall die by blades, cudgels, or warfare; some by lightning, hail, or tempest. Some, though not yet dead, shall suffer every manner of foul disease: the five-colored swellings of *qi*, emaciation, madness, epilepsy, scabies, leprosy, ulcers, sores, scars, consumption, malaria, blindness, deafness, muteness, stuttering, throat closures, nasal obstructions, vertigo, hunchbacks, protruding chests, twisted limbs, swollen bellies, heart pain, vomiting, and retching. These myriad afflictions, too numerous to name, are the retribution for your past sins, which you have failed to recognize.\n\nWe, now entrusted with the salvation of the people, cannot bear to see you endure such suffering and perpetual calamity. Thus, we specially dispatch the Radiant Net Realized One to carry this scripture through the world, delivering all beings from the five sufferings, dissolving disasters, averting misfortunes, rescuing the imperiled, healing the sick, and eradicating the roots of all woes. Should any among the people—whether commoners or officials—suffer from these afflictions, or be entangled in lawsuits and imprisoned for years, or face droughts, floods, locusts, warfare, or epidemics that no physician can cure, let them invite a high-ranking master of the Three Caverns to purify and establish a sacred altar. Let them turn the scriptures, recite the incantations, submit memorials, set up fasts, and perform rites to thank the Five Emperors.

flowing cinnabar,\nNone fail to prostrate in reverence.\n\n---\n\nEstablishing the Great Purification Rite for three nights:\nWondrous are the Three Cavern Scriptures,\nDivinely guarded, welcomed by nine dragons.\nEstablishing the rite dispels anxious hearts,\nAllowing one to wander the Purple Phoenix City.\nMeritorious resolve accumulates over ten thousand kalpas,\nHow dare demons disobey?\nClear and resonant, the eight tones resound,\nThe capital of the Most High in the ten directions.\nThe Three Caverns are best studied with wholehearted devotion,\nTo guide and transform, delivering sentient beings.\nWhen the scripture is expounded,\nThree bows are made while listening to the teachings.\nBeyond the distant Three Realms,\nVast and boundless, profoundly obscure.\nNow we

length of your lives,\nBefore they are ordered to pursue and seize you.\nThus, the celestial bureaus issue decrees,\nAnd demon kings spread plagues and diseases.\nAll because of the sins committed by your body, heart, mouth, and hands.\nNow, for the sake of you and all beings,\nI broadly proclaim repentance.\nLet each demon king and ghostly lord\nHear these scriptural words,\nNaturally generating shame and remorse,\nWithdrawing their poisons and diseases.\n\nYou, the people of this world,\nListen with a tranquil heart\nAs I recount the origins of your sins.\"\n\nThe Dao speaks: \"Now I tell

Only after this shall they emerge, reborn as birds and beasts, the six kinds of livestock—despised and abhorred by humankind, their names unwelcome to the ear. They shall feed on filth and foulness, even mingled with excrement. Their desires shall never be sated; they shall bear heavy burdens in toil and suffering, lashed by whips and cudgels. Once they lose the human form, ten thousand kalpas shall pass before they regain it. Such is the retribution for mocking this sutra.\n\nNow I look upon the beings of the lower realms, and see their suffering and joy, their lifespans long or short, their stations noble or base, their deeds unequal. Thus do I pity all those tormented by suffering, as a mother pities her infant child. I exhort the foolish and ignorant to revere and believe, that all may be liberated and ascend to the heavens, spared the afflictions of the womb, ever possessing bodies pure and free. They shall wander with me, and I proclaim this verse:\n\n*The samādhi spreads far and wide;*\n*Those with karmic affinity may hear it.*\n*The wise at once believe and receive;*\n*For kalpas they shall be noble ones.*\n*Though briefly born in the world of men,*\n*Soon they shall ascend as immortals.*\n*To deliver all beings, I come to this cause.*\n\nI dispatch the devas and humans, the true immortals of countless kalpas, to teach and transform the benighted. Yet the wicked refuse to believe, and further mock this sutra, declaring its teachings devoid of spiritual efficacy. They show no reverence or love, and in this life they suffer retribution: afflicted by disease, plagued by pestilence ghosts and demon kings who come to destroy their households, their kin and wives and children all perish, their deaths still insufficient. Their souls descend into hell, where for ten thousand kalpas there is no release, cast into the darkness of *qi*. Imprisoned in heavy fetters, they endure torment most grievous. Through the long night of darkness, they emerge at last as birds and beasts, feeding on foulness, or reborn as livestock. Scorned by humankind, they bear heavy loads beneath the whip. Such is the punishment for those who slight this sutra.\n\nYet those who believe and receive it shall gain blessings and ascend to heaven. Those with the bones of immortals shall uphold the *Samādhi Sutra*. You who cultivate the Middle Way shall behold the True Lord.\n\nWhen the Most High had spoken this verse, the Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens, the thirty-six Heavenly Demon Kings, the celestial maidens, the devas, Brahmā kings, demon kings, and their retinues, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s hymn, rejoiced in their hearts. As one, they rose, prostrated themselves, and bowed twice, saying: “We, the Great Brahmā and Demon Kings, together with our followers, shall ever guard and protect, traversing the world. For those who uphold this sutra, we shall ensure freedom from disease, capturing and slaying the pestilence ghosts, malevolent spirits, and demonic plagues that bring calamity, that their illnesses may swiftly be cured. May all their wishes be fulfilled, their legal troubles resolved, their endeavors successful. If any evil demons, perverse spirits, or wicked ghosts disobey the Most High’s command, we shall seize and rend them into ten thousand pieces, grinding them to dust, and show no mercy. We, the Demon Kings, now swear together: we shall not commit evil, but pray to transform our demonic forms, ever walking the immortal path, drawing near to the Great Sage.”\n\nAt that time, the Perfected Ones—Weiming, Luotong, Zhishi, Zhang, and Junminzi—and the assembled devas, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s wondrous verse, rejoiced greatly.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Summoning the Celestial Deities and Dragon Spirits to Pacify Tombs and Dwellings**\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord, prior to the Radiant Dawn of the Great Beginning, accompanied the assembly of celestial deities, immortals, and the ten supreme Divine Kings of the Great Sages. Together they proceeded to the ruins of Yang Valley beneath the Long Sang Grove, circumambulating thrice to the left in ritual procession. With one heart, they bowed in reverence and addressed the Primordial Heavenly Worthy:\n\n“Your servant observes that when the parents or kin of ordinary people pass away, they are interred upon the hills, tombs erected to secure their rest for ten thousand years, in hope of safeguarding descendants and ensuring prosperity for their children. Yet those who remain at home suffer misfortune year after year, enduring constant hardship, annual calamities, and the dissipation of wealth and grain. Misfortunes befall them without cause, entangling them in official lawsuits and imprisonment for years. Their livestock fails to multiply, their fields and silkworms lose vitality, their fortunes falter, and their plans go awry.\n\n“By virtue of past karma, they now enjoy blessings in this life and, on this day, have been granted the sight of the Most High and Supreme Worthy. I humbly beseech You to dispel my ignorance and grant Your compassionate mercy. Should You deign to instruct me, even the decayed bones of the departed shall be revived, and they shall receive Your boundless grace—a debt impossible to repay for the gift of life.”\n\nThereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy snapped His fingers and furrowed His brow, addressing the Most High Dao Lord:\n\n“What you have described regarding the causes of misfortune is indeed a profound means to relieve suffering. To deliver those sunk in delusion and guide them to the shore of fortune, you may now be seated.”\n\nWith utmost reverence, the Dao Lord gazed upon the sacred countenance, his heart earnest and intent, listening with unwavering focus and sincere devotion.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then asked the Most High Dao Lord:\n\n“Have you observed those who enjoy abundance and warmth, as well as those who suffer hunger and cold?”\n\nThe Dao Lord replied:\n\n“I have seen them often, yet I do not fully understand the root of their conditions. I humbly beseech Your sacred grace to bestow Your guidance.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\n\n“Those who receive such good fortune may owe it to the blessings they cultivated in past lives, now ripening in this one. Or they may inherit the residual virtue of their ancestors, which extends to their descendants. If, in addition to enjoying such abundance, they aid the poor and relieve the suffering, restore ancient sacred sites and immortal dwellings, and diligently build and maintain them, they shall reap blessings in this very life, not merely in the hereafter.\n\n“As for those who endure hunger, cold, and poverty, their suffering may stem from past lives in which they plundered and harmed the virtuous. Or they may have stolen materials meant for construction, failed to rescue those in peril, or refused to assist those in distress. Perhaps they exploited many laborers, hoarded grain in granaries, amassed wealth in their households, or relied upon their riches in silver and gold. They may have complained of their dwellings being too cramped or their halls too low, disregarding the dangers of harming life or the signs of declining fortune and severed destiny. Acting recklessly, they violated the Two Black Stars and Five Yellow Stars, inviting the doom of dwindling households and failed enterprises. Or, when burying their kin, they feared only the ominous cries of women and the killing of children, neglecting to choose auspicious years and months for the benefit of the deceased when constructing the tomb. Such actions invoke the Five Ghosts and Three Calamities of the dead, bringing misfortune upon the living and causing their households to suffer violence. They may associate with wicked companions, bully the weak, offend their elders, curse their fathers, or deceive their mothers, leading to injuries from wood and stone, harm from snakes and tigers, or death by lightning, fire, plague, warfare, or imprisonment. Year after year, they face lawsuits, lose wealth without cause, fail in their endeavors, and struggle to achieve their goals. Their fields and silkworms languish, their households fall into discord, their livestock fails to thrive, and they wander in perpetual hardship, year after year of misfortune, with no path to peace.\n\n“Those of high practice who comprehend the scriptures, along with the Daoist priests, shall follow the natural codes of the *Numinous Treasure*. They may conduct rites day and night, offering incense, ascending the altar, and submitting petitions. Thrice daily, they shall perform the ritual circumambulation and recite the scriptures, summoning the celestial deities, earthly spirits, dragon kings, and sacred assemblies to absolve past transgressions and future errors, repenting for former sins and seeking forgiveness for deep offenses. They shall pray for the descent of boundless grace to deliver them.\n\n“The altar shall stand two *zhang* and four *cun* in height, exceeding one *zhang* and two *chi* in width. It shall be adorned with twenty-four stalks of *zuan*, encircled thrice to the left by a cord. The Gate of Heaven and the Door of Earth shall be opened, along with the Human Gate and the Ghost Gate. Within the altar, arrange eleven incense altars or five incense tables for the directions. Adorn the ritual space with banners and canopies.\n\n“With utmost reverence, they shall invoke the Nameless and Natural Great Dao, the Jade Purity Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Highest Purity Jade Dawn Dao Lord, the Supreme Purity Mysterious Origin Venerable Lord, the Most High Great One of the Empty Cavern Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and the Five Elder Emperor Lords of the Great Beginning, the Three Primordial Venerable Saints, the Sovereigns of the Sun and Moon, the Five Planetary Sages, the Seven Primordial Perfected Lords, the Divine Perfected of the Five Celestial Granaries, and the officials of the Three Terraces.\n\n“With solemn respect, they shall state the purpose of their prayer, purifying body and mind. Then they shall unfurl the scriptures and recite the names and titles of the dragon spirits.\n\n“They shall invoke:\nThe Azure Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the East,\nThe Vermilion Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the South,\nThe White Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the West,\nThe Black Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the North,\nThe Yellow Emperor Dragon King who Guards Tombs and Pacifies Dwellings in the Center.\n\nThe Dragon King of the Eastern Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Southern Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Western Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Northern Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of the Central Treasury,\nThe Dragon King of Auspicious Cultivation in the East,\nThe Dragon King of Abundant Goodness in the South,\nThe Dragon King of Sweet Thoughts in the West,\nThe Dragon King of Flowing Waves in the North,\nThe Dragon King of the Black Dragon in the Center.\n\nThe Celestial Deity Dragon King,\nThe Earthly Spirit Dragon King,\nThe Dragon King of the Nation,\nThe Dragon King of the Prefecture,\nThe Dragon King of the Deep Forest,\nThe Dragon King of Blossoming Flowers,\nThe Dragon King of Auspicious Joy,\nThe Dragon King of Thoughtful Celebration,\nThe Dragon King of Palaces,\nThe Dragon King of Halls,\nThe Dragon King of Houses,\nThe Dragon King of Chambers,\nThe Dragon King of Kitchens and Hearths,\nThe Dragon King of Estates and Fields,\nThe Dragon King of Silkworms and Mulberries,\nThe Dragon King of Silk and Cotton,\nThe Dragon King of Fine Silk,\nThe Dragon King of Brocade and Fine Fabrics—”",

Upon the conclusion of the fast and the dispersal of the altar, a grand *jiao* offering to summon the dragons should be held, ensuring the protection and stability of the household, the nation, the king, and the common folk. All shall attain peace, free from disasters, with misfortunes dissolved, blessings and protection universally bestowed, bandits and thieves vanishing without trace, and the divine dragons shielding and dispelling calamities, swiftly banishing them a myriad miles beyond the borders. The people shall rejoice in their livelihoods, and a single planting shall yield ninefold harvests.\n\nBy the edict of the Most High, the myriad celestial dragon kings and the divine soldiers and warriors of the ten directions shall each receive their commands and descend to guard the nation, the prefectures, the ancestral tombs, and the households. At this time, the sovereigns, ministers, and officials of the nation and prefectures, along with the common people, shall wholeheartedly embrace the Dao, each vowing to receive the *Marvelous Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Divine Footsteps*, allowing the Dharma to spread and flourish. The celestial dragon deities, the great sage divine kings, the warriors, the perfected immortals, and the divine soldiers shall all come to safeguard them. The faithful male and female disciples who uphold the scriptural Dharma shall each be blessed with longevity, perpetually occupying positions of emolument. The lands shall enjoy eternal peace, the people shall thrive in prosperity, the eight grains shall ripen abundantly, and the world shall be at great peace. The Three Luminaries shall shine with true radiance, ever adhering to the proper measures of time; the Five Movements shall not err, and the Four Seasons shall follow their course. The Three Calamities shall be forever eradicated, and the scourge of war shall vanish without trace.\n\nHasten, hasten, in accordance with the Most High’s edict, as the divine dragon’s great decree to pacify the people!\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy further addressed the people of the Lower Realm: From this day forward, if there be any nation or prefecture in turmoil, its people in distress, the Three Calamities arising in competition, the Five Poisons spreading unchecked, bandits and thieves encroaching upon the people, villages and hamlets reduced to ashes, the people losing their livelihoods, prefectures and commanderies laid to waste, the populace starving and enslaved, kin and kindred estranged, and flesh and blood sundered—these are the works of demonic soldiers and rampant disasters, bringing bitter suffering to humanity. If there be a sovereign, prefectural lord, or regional governor who can lead the multitudes—whether ten households or five—uniting their hearts and strength to procure incense and oil, establish a ritual arena, and sincerely invite accomplished Daoist masters well-versed in the scriptures and precepts to recite the *Sacred Canon of Dragon-Summoning* and the *Northern Dipper’s Abyssal Secret Texts*, with unified devotion and purified intent, together venerating the true image of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the august forms of the Five Venerable Sovereigns, and the true visages of all the immortals and sages, presenting their supplications with utmost sincerity—then I shall dispatch the summoned hosts of sacred perfected dragon deities to descend upon the ritual arena, heeding the people’s wishes. They shall deploy their soldiers to capture and subdue the malevolent demons causing harm, extinguishing the Five Poisons and the Three Calamities. They shall bestow vast grace and great blessings, protecting and sheltering the devoted common folk, who shall forever receive the profound favor of the Dao, perpetually bathing in its compassion. Their plans shall unfold as desired, their endeavors shall succeed, their undertakings shall all come to fruition, their families shall flourish, and their gates shall prosper with noble lineages.\n\nAfter peace is restored, they shall devote themselves even more sincerely to revering the Three Luminaries and honoring all the numinous deities, naturally and eternally enjoying tranquility and prosperity.\n\nHasten, hasten, in accordance with the Most High’s edict to deliver the people from disaster and invoke blessings!\n\nThus concludes the seventeenth scroll of the *Most High Abyssal Divine Incantations Scripture*.\nThe eighteenth scroll of the *Most High Abyssal Divine Incantations Scripture*:\n**Determining the Fortunes and Misfortunes within the Six Jia Cycles and Invoking Blessings**\n\nThe Dao proclaimed: In the *Longhan* era of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, together with the Five Venerable Sovereigns, the Two Palaces of Yin and Yang, the Five Perfected Stars of the Upper Realms, the Seven Perfected Lords of the Primal Origins, and the officials of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, they roamed the Three Heavens, determining the fortunes and misfortunes of the mortal realm. Later, in the first year of the *Shanghuang* era, the year of *jiawu*, they descended upon the Central Lands of *Zhendan*, observing the various nations of this world. Blessings and auspices were rare, pestilence and miasmas raged fiercely, the people suffered widespread displacement, and the lands were afflicted by alternating floods and droughts, causing the Five Grains to fail in their ripening.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy sighed in lamentation, moved by the suffering of the multitudes. Thereupon, he manifested his divine power, revealing the might of the Dao, his majestic radiance universally illuminating and inspecting the lands and nations. He summoned the celestial immortals and sages, the myriad celestial dragon kings, the jade maidens and immortal youths of the dragon palaces—seven thousand two hundred in number—as well as the spirits and deities governing the mountains, rivers, pools, and caves within their domains, all assembling at the sacred gathering to gaze upon his august countenance and listen to the proclamation of the true Dharma. Then, winds howled and thunder roared, sweet rains poured down in torrents, the sagely grace flowed like mist, washing away all inauspiciousness, and the lands rejoiced in peace and prosperity.\n\nAt that time, among the assembly, there was a lofty Daoist master named *Mingluo*, who stepped forward from the crowd, prostrated himself, and paid homage, saying: \"By virtue of past blessings, your servant has been privileged to attend upon your august presence. Through the great and lesser *yangjiu* calamities, I have been bathed in your grace, yet I remain ignorant. I humbly inquire: within the six *jia* cycles, from whence do the annual disasters arise? I implore your compassionate illumination and the bestowal of your boundless grace, that this withered wood may encounter the warmth of spring, and the dried fish may meet the life-giving spring rains.\"",

Thus are divided the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan, each Yuan governing sixty years. Now I shall expound the prosperity, scarcity, fortune, and misfortune of each year within a Yuan. You should transcribe this as I speak, that it may be shown to later generations and the years of disaster and blessing be made manifest.\n\nWhen one encounters the first yang, let them adjust their conduct with sincerity and early supplicate for divine protection.\n\nThus is the ode recited:\n\n**Jiazi Year:** In autumn, the tillers bear bitter sorrow.\nThe grain sprouts fail to ripen, calamity harms the fields.\nBut mark the time after autumn’s onset—\nHigh fields cannot be preserved.\nToiling through winter and spring,\nFathers and sons flee their homes.\nBrothers become strangers on the road,\nWives and children scrape by alone.\nAll the people suffer hardship,\nThe folk scatter a thousand *li* away.\n\n**Yichou Year:** In spring, pestilence harms the myriad people.\nAt summer’s beginning, plague arises,\nStriking especially the people of Chu and Lu.\nHouseholds all struggle to feed themselves,\nWhile in Wu, families scatter.\nThe people flee beyond a thousand *li*,\nThe six livestock all meet with disaster.\nHigh fields may still be planted,\nBut lowlands suffer blighted sprouts.\nThe plague is as severe as the year before—\nNone may remain to guard their homes.\n\n**Bingyin Year:** At the start, fierce beasts roam in packs.\nThe four seas all surge in waves,\nFrom the wilds to the hills and mounds.\nHigh fields are fit for planting,\nAlong the ridges and mountain slopes.\nBut mark the fourth and fifth months—\nFish throng the courtyards.\n\n**Dingmao Year:** Do not follow the fleeting winds.\nEarly spring lacks heavy rain,\nBut mid-autumn brings great floods.\nLow fields suffer endless calamity,\nWhile the mountainsides are fit for labor.\nThough the year yields a meager harvest,\nThe granaries cannot but remain empty.\n\n**Wuchen Year:** Wrapped in calamity, locusts all arise in swarms.\nThe people suffer plague,\nWomen grieve over life and death.\nDisaster strikes in mid-autumn,\nRice emerges from the mountainsides.\nLowlands surely cannot be reaped—\nThey are bound to be swept by floods.\n\n**Jisi Year:** At the outset, fish play before the steps.\nIn the lakes, dragons emerge,\nBoats traverse the thoroughfares.\nLevel roads are submerged,\nAll rice and millet are swept away.\nIf one seeks dry ground,\nThey must early build lofty dwellings.\n\n**Gengwu Year:** At the start, both flood and drought appear.\nBoats sail upon the roads,\nHorses are led through the lakes.\nSummer brings a hundred days of drought,\nAutumn suffers three, six, and nine days of deluge.\nThe grain surely grows in high fields,\nHarvested early at winter’s onset.\nLate reaping must meet with disaster,\nAnd warfare will soon arise.\n\n**Xinwei Year:** Plant near the mountains’ edge.\nEarly spring brings great floods,\nSummer must surely be parched.\nWu will suffer no misfortune,\nBut Jing and Chu are bound by calamity.\nThough early summer sees slight drought,\nAutumn springs overflow their sources.\nPlague cannot but arise,\nAffecting every household.\n\n**Renshen Year:** High fields are hard to preserve.\nChariots roll through the canals,\nWu’s lands are no longer seen.\nGranaries are meager and cramped,\nHouseholds lack even a *sheng* or *dou*.\nThe northern lands suffer successive calamities,\nAll nine regions endure them together.\nPlague also breaks out in Deng and Lai,\nAnd along the shores of the Wu River.\n\n**Guiyou Year:** Neither high nor low fields are to be pitied.\nEarly spring brings drought,\nSummer’s onset brings ceaseless floods.\nLate autumn’s winds and fires rage,\nThe rice and millet are not abundant.\nBut mark the lands of Qi and Lu—\nThere lies the year of famine.\n\n**Jiaxu Year:** At spring’s outset, pests bring calamity.\nSummer’s heat meets drought,\nAutumn and winter are swept by floods.\nHigh fields planted in vain—\nThey must surely see only weeds.\nTo know the pools of disaster,\nLook to Yan, Wei, and Shandong.\n\n**Yihai Year:** At the start, flood and drought fill the channels.\nCalamity arises from this,\nGreat demons dwell within the cities.\nFrom afar, it corresponds to the ninth and fifth,\nThe year of gains and losses is not yet begun.\nWhere the grain sprouts are planted,\nBoth high and low may yet be settled.\n\n**Bingzi Year:** Passing, the fields lie beyond the rivers.\nThe toiling people suffer hardship,\nThe sprouts are harmed in great numbers.\nPlague rats gather in troops,\nTen or more share a single nest.\nPiously entreat the gods’ protection,\nTo safeguard the harvest of the coming season.\n\n**Dingchou Year:** The farmers cannot be at ease.\nThough they plant in early spring,\nAt autumn’s onset, it becomes a sea.\nOxen and horses suffer harm,\nJingzhao is most alarmed.\nTo know where the sprouts flourish,\nThe rice emerges from last year’s fields.\n\n**Wuyin Year:** The mountaintops are fit for fields.\nRoads become river channels,\nStarving people die by the wayside.\nFish and turtles run with hares,\nLotus is planted on high banks.\nBut mark the end of early summer—\nBoats race before the courtyards.\n\n**Jimao Year:** In high fields, the sprouts fare well.\nThough early spring lacks water,\nSummer and autumn merge with the vast rivers.\nChu and Lu suffer these calamities,\nWhile Wu and Yue receive grace.\nThat year brings abundant harvests,\nPlanting should all be done early.\n\n**Gengchen Year:** The people of Yan and Wei rise up.\nLivestock fare likewise,\nThe sprouts are devoured by pests.\nThe mountainsides are fit for labor,\nThe people of Wu rejoice in their toil.\nLowlands suffer flooding,\nBut mid and high fields are most bountiful.\n\n**Xinsi Year:** At the eaves’ end, fish play in the gutters.\nFish swim through the streets and lanes,\nThe rice sprouts flourish on the hills.\nPlanting should press forward,\nLabor should not lag behind.\nLowlands hold disaster,\nBut mid and high fields are most abundant.\n\n**Renwu Year:** In spring, flood and drought are not in harmony.\nWhere it is dry, a thousand *li* are troubled,\nWhere it is low, fish sport in play.\nNot only is there famine,\nBut also the frequent fear of war.\nPlague and miasma arise year after year,\nHunger and hardship are also manifold.\n\n**Guiwei Year:** Five households share a single well.\nSpring and summer meet with miasma,\nAutumn brings floods once more.\nBut mark the lands of Wu and Chu,\nAnd also those in Shandong.\nTo the west, famine arises—\nThe farmers should but labor on.\n\n**Jiashen Year:** Gathering, the fears are not long in coming.\nChariots roll through flooded lakes,\nHorses gallop at the Three Rivers’ mouth.\nThose who move their homes surely do not return—\nThis is the fault of calamity.\nRice emerges along the Five Lakes’ shores,\nPlanting the mountainsides is of no use.\n\n**You Year:** In shifting, spring drought must surely come.\"",

This secret method foretells a year’s abundance or famine, safety or peril, and the rise and fall of the five grains. You must carve it into your bones and remember it well, keeping it within your hearts alone. Do not reveal it to the reckless, the faithless, or the base.\"\n\nThen he intoned:\n*\"On New Year’s Day and the advent of spring,*\n*First meet the Tiger or Hare.*\n*If delayed to the third or fourth watch,*\n*Pass not the fifth day.*\n*Should this term be met,*\n*Grain will be cheap, the people free from suffering.*\n*If it falls within the seventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth,*\n*Rice will be dear, the year lean, and rain scarce.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke to the assembled immortals: \"I compose this hymn to be passed down eternally to my disciples, that they may foresee inauspicious years and lean seasons, and prepare by storing grain. Should disaster’s portion descend, then deploy my rites of exorcism and prayer. Choose a solitary peak or sheer cliff, or a place between water and mountain; failing that, an ancient sacred site or altar, or even a public courtyard or orchid-strewn wilds—anywhere pure and unsullied, far from filth and defilement. There, in accordance with the strict codes of the Three Caverns, establish an altar and set up the ritual implements.\n\nIf acting for the king, the chief minister, the prefect, or the magistrate, then array a three-tiered sacred altar, open twenty-four gates, and set out twenty-four incense feasts. With wholehearted devotion, invoke the Three Pure Dao, the Five Venerable Lords of the Great Beginning, the officials of the Three Primes, the immortals and divine officers of the forty-six grotto-heavens, and the spirits of famous mountains, great rivers, abysses, and marshes. Hold a fast for three days to disperse the altar, and conduct a grand offering, adjusting its scale to the abundance or scarcity of resources. Recite the scriptures for summoning dragons, and present memorials on yellow silk. Alternatively, compose a memorial in devotion to the Dao, spoken aloud with utmost sincerity. Do not treat the rites with negligence.\n\nThe vulgar and base, however, first slight the true sages of the heavens, and second, scorn officials and the common people. They mobilize the masses in vain, squander resources, and thus their prayers go unanswered, while incurring grave karmic retribution. Those who practice my teachings must proceed with awe and caution.\"\n\nThen the Radiant Perfected Lord Ming Luo and the assembled immortals, having received the Heavenly Worthy’s guidance on abundance and famine, disaster and fortune, and his instruction in the rites of exorcism and prayer, each adjusted their robes and crowns and bowed in reverent prostration.",

      "translated_text": "The various Perfected Lords and High Ministers each mounted their phoenix carriages and dragon chariots, attending the Heavenly Worthy as they ascended back to the Jade Realm, where they were received with welcoming rites. The divine spirits and the assembly who had heard the Dharma all returned to their original stations.\n\n*Thus concludes Scroll Eighteen of the* Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra.\n*Scroll Nineteen of the* Supreme Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations Sutra: *The Decree to the Heavenly Demons*\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in the Land of Great Blessing’s Palace of Eternal Joy, sat upon a throne woven of seven-jeweled treasures alongside the Boundless Great Sage, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings. As he expounded the *Great Expulsion Sutra of the Cavernous Abyss Divine Incantations*, he summoned the Ten Directions’ Kings of the Samadhi Divine Incantations and the Flying Transcendent Perfected Great Spirits of the Mysterious and Wondrous Heavens to gather before his seat.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: \"Have you heard that along the ten borders of the Land of Great Blessing in the Palace of Eternal Joy, demonic ghosts recklessly arise, harming the men and women of the multitude, so that the sound of sorrow and suffering is ever present?\"\n\nThe Dao Lord replied: \"This realm has been the World of Ultimate Bliss for seven billion five hundred million kalpas, and there has been no sound of lamentation. Since the era of Dragon Han, however, the men and women of the people have all been born with fierce and murderous natures, offering lewd prayers to the various demonic spirits, vainly seeking to sustain their lives. Since that time of awakening, for seven billion five hundred million kalpas, the people have suffered poverty and hardship, their forms withering with age and illness. Whether man or woman, all share the same intent, flattering and beseeching evil ghosts. The residual *qi* of the Six Heavens, bearing the nine-fold ugliness of the Wood Essence’s demonic illusions, enters their hearts, giving rise to violent rebellion. They kill the innocent without cause, and the power of evil spirits grows ever stronger.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Five Venerable Celestial Emperors to summon the Ten Great Demons of Heaven, the Lords of the Three Realms, and the Great Soldiers of the Supreme Perfected Divine Armies—countless myriads—to capture all the ghosts who had slipped from the registers of the world. He asked: \"Which of them harm the people, causing the lands to know no great peace, the people to bear many debts, and life and death to hold no tranquility?\"\n\nThe Perfected Kings of the Three Heavens, along with the Three Heavens’ Great Soldiers of the Ten Directions’ Divine Perfected, roamed the borders of the lands. For all people, they healed illness, aided the upright *qi* of Heaven, slew and extinguished evil essences, and rescued the lives of the multitude, all through the power of the Dao, preserving their heavenly destinies.\n\n\"From this day forward, if there are Daoist priests who submit to the Three Caverns, receive and uphold this sutra, and carry its Dharma to travel the world, healing the sick so that they may recover and know no premature death—should any ghost refuse to depart or dare to act wickedly against such a Daoist priest in the course of healing, I shall dispatch the Great Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens with their armies to bind and capture them, exterminating their factions and cutting off their influence in other lands.\"\n\nThe Dao declared: \"Within the Three Realms, from this day forward, in the perverse and doomed lands of the latter kalpas, where yin *qi* and turbid evil arise, change will swiftly come. Simplicity and purity having been lost, frivolity and competition will flourish. In the Four Heavens and Eight Directions below, those who style themselves as Demon Kings of the Divine will emerge, naming themselves the Heavenly Spirits of a turbid and evil age, spreading throughout the lower realms. Within the Four Heavens, the mountain and forest stone essences will possess living people, men and women alike imitating and learning from one another, calling themselves Heavenly Kings. Together with the residual *qi* ghosts of the Six Heavens and the ghosts who have slipped from the world’s registers, they will form factions, branching and dispersing, adopting names in accordance with the times, bringing calamity to the myriad people. They will cause people to pray and supplicate, flattering and beseeching for protection, turning their backs on the Dao to believe in evil, offering food and seeking blessings. These ghosts will grow ever more powerful, gnawing at people’s essence and *qi*, consuming their blood and vessels, cutting short their years. Unaware, people will allow them to enter their bodies, causing them to despise life and love death. Such ghosts, in numbers beyond count, will bewitch men and women alike.\n\nWherever a Daoist priest travels to heal such afflictions, I shall dispatch the Great Spirits of the Ten Directions and the Envoys of the Five Peaks—three hundred thousand in number—to assist the Daoist in healing illness. From this day forward, in the years of *jiashen* and *renchen*, great armies will arise in the world, and plague demons will kill people, nine out of every ten. The world will be vast and desolate, the people distressed and suffering, their rulers indifferent. Thirty kinds of illness will afflict the world, beyond all cure. If there are Daoist priests who submit to the *Three Caverns Divine Incantations Sutra*, I shall send down the Great Divine Soldiers of Heaven to assist them in healing illness. They shall invoke the Great Kings of the Samadhi Divine Incantations to lead a host of one hundred thousand red-armored soldiers and golden-armored warriors. They shall also summon the Generals of the Nine Heavens’ Punitive Campaigns—four hundred thousand strong. And the Green-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the Red-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the White-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the *Qi*-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the Yellow-Armored Soldiers—four hundred thousand. And the Great Soldiers of Prohibitions and Slaughter—four hundred thousand. And the Great Officers of the Azure Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the Red Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the White Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the Black Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. And the Great Officers of the Yellow Heaven—four hundred eighty thousand. Each shall lead armies of countless myriads, wielding the triple-armored implements for slaying ghosts to assist the Daoist in healing illness. Should any ghost dare to act with malicious poison, or any evil person direct their malevolent intent toward this Daoist, they shall be slain one by one, leaving no trace of harm to people or ghosts, thereby manifesting the divine efficacy of the Great Dao.\"\n\nThe Dao declared: \"If a Daoist priest dwells in hidden mountain valleys or among the people, they should wholeheartedly rescue those in peril and dire distress, reciting the sutras and performing the Daoist rites thrice daily. After reciting the sutras and performing the rites for one to three days, they shall face north in the central courtyard and present the *Precious Chapter of the Great Expulsion* once. They shall also wear the Registers of the Great Talismans of the Nine Heavens, inscribed on silk, and don the divine talismans. Thus, the sick shall swiftly recover, and no harm shall come to people or ghosts—all shall be resolved clearly and completely. These ghostly spirits shall each gather pestilence and seize poisons for the Daoist, aiding them in healing the sick.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Dispelling Ghosts Through the Long Night**\n\nThe Dao speaks: Long ago, I traveled with Wen Shi and Red Pine Master, leading seventy thousand Brahma Kings, roaming the outskirts of the Five Ridges in the world. We saw those who had died by the blade—not merely one or two. The Most High, moved by compassion, dispatched transformed Daoist priests to ask them: *\"What crimes have you committed to suffer such torment?\"* Each answered: *\"We endure this cruel agony, yet know not its cause. We only beseech the Great Compassion to bestow its decree upon the transformed ones.\"*\n\nThe Dao said: *\"Hark! Do you not know? The great kalpa draws near, and the waters shall soon rise. All the people of the world shall become as mud. Such as you are not few. Why do you not cultivate the Dao and thus endure forever? You covet wealth and rank, fleeting as a moment, and so fail to attain transcendence through ten thousand kalpas. You see no good roots, and thus remain obscured by heaven and earth, bound to calamity as your fate. The world is impure, and the Five Thieves lead men astray, drawing them into evil destinies. They drain men’s spirit-qi and cast them into the abyss. One misstep, and regret comes too late.\"*\n\nAs the Most High spoke these words, thirty-nine thousand in the assembly, one hundred thousand heavenly maidens, two hundred thirty thousand transformed ones beneath the earth, and four hundred ninety thousand Daoist priests and demon kings—men and women alike—all rose in astonishment, seeking to receive this scripture. From this day forth, they vowed to uphold this Dharma, to teach and transform the foolish, that they might no longer crave official rank or royal station. Each swore: *\"Today, we have heard the Celestial Worthy’s words and shall act upon them, daring not to disobey.\"* They removed their garments to receive the scripture.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the world’s latter age, thirty-nine thousand people shall attain the rank of Upper Immortal, ascending upon the Most High’s nine dragons. Three hundred million heavenly beings shall traverse the lands, welcoming Daoist priests of immortal bone. In that era, great floods shall arise, and ghostly armies shall clash. Countless men and women shall perish. Now, I specially dispatch transformed ones to journey across the Four Seas, commanding all to prepare the scriptures and receive the *Precious Chapter of the Great Expulsion*, donning its protective signs. Among them, those with faith shall hear and rejoice, seeking the transformed ones to receive it. But those who disbelieve shall hear yet remain unmoved, drifting aimlessly into the nine rivers and three streams until all perish. Alas!\n\nThe Most High, riding upon five-colored clouds in the void, gazed down in great compassion, lamenting the foolishness of these beings. *\"Alas, alas! How shall I save them?\"* Then, mounting a dragon, He led the heavenly hosts, all the sage-kings, and a hundred million immortals of the Five Peaks into the midst of the great flood to rescue those of steadfast faith, granting them fearlessness. Great ravens bore them aloft to the Nine Heavens. The dragon-borne ascents spanned ten thousand leagues in breadth, some two thousand nine hundred leagues, others one thousand two hundred leagues. There were eighty million such ascents, each capable of carrying three hundred million people. Yet those who did not receive the scriptures, who heard not the Dharma, who kept no fasts, who knew not the Dharma-realm—none could board these ascents.\n\nThough the transformed ones sought to rescue them as the great waters rose, the Beam Spirits and Controller Officials would slay them, seizing the sinners and casting them back into the waters. Yet the Most High, the Perfect Sage, could still save them, and the flying immortals—men and women—assisted in delivering the people. Countless great ravens arrived as one, bearing away those of virtuous conduct.\n\n*\"You Daoist priests, having now seen this* Great Expulsion Scripture *and heard the Most High, and beheld His form and image—you shall indeed encounter the dragon-borne ascents in future lives. The words of the sages are not empty!\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: These immortals and jade maidens were born before heaven and earth, enduring many kalpas. Now, they join Me in teaching and transforming the foolish. Only those with immortal bone may behold their forms. You, in turn, must each transmit this teaching to later generations—men and women alike—who, if they receive it together, shall not die untimely deaths. When the great flood comes, they shall not be among the drowned.\n\nThe great assembly, hearing the Celestial Worthy’s words, wept in sorrow and sought to receive and uphold them. Moved by compassion, the Most High commanded the transformed ones to enter the mountains and erect an altar, where eighty million men and women from the multitude received the scripture. The demon kings and their followers, unable to attend, pledged their faith and came to the mountains to receive it.\n\nThe Dao speaks: *\"You who receive this* Precious Scripture of the Great Expulsion *—its essentials shall make you immortals. Diligently transform and deliver others, passing it on to the foolish. The foolish, with their inverted views, are pitiable indeed. In the coming age, the great flood shall engulf them. The sages see the foolish living heedlessly, like men observing worms in a privy—unaware of when they might emerge. You Daoist priests who fail to transform them shall remain forever mired in birth and death.\"*\n\nThe great assembly—immortals of the Five Peaks, all four divisions, heavenly beings, men and women—all sighed in unison: *\"Excellent! We too shall uphold this!\"*\n\nThe Dao speaks: Beyond the Northern Sea lies the land of the Yilin Kingdom, comprising forty-eight thousand households. They do not believe in the Dao or its laws, killing living beings for their own use. Their land is in turmoil, and the people rebel, slaughtering three hundred each day. The Most High, seeing the great flood approaching and the foolish unaware, committing sins that cast them into evil destinies—when would they ever escape?—entered the Dark Mountain and observed all beings drifting aimlessly. Whither were they bound? Then, He released the light from within His body, illuminating the ten directions. He dispatched transformed ones from the ten directions to fly through the void to the land of Yilin.\n\nThe kings, seeing them, were greatly alarmed: *\"These beings ride the empty air—what are they? Are they not demonic spirits?\"* They immediately sent thirty thousand men to shoot arrows upward. Yet the arrows turned back and struck their own people dead—who then revived.",

The* Great Expulsion Scripture *is the foremost among scriptures, the king of the thirty-six divisions of scriptures—none surpass it.

Thus, the dead may meet fortune or misfortune. Those who die in the third month of spring are slain by the emissaries of the Great Yang, ruled by the Lord of the Nine Yi. Ninety myriad great spirits select them, their might like boiling broth. The stars above shall dim, and their fate shall be severed.

If, after death, someone recites this scripture for them, eight hundred million great spirits shall deliver their departed souls, restoring them to rebirth in heaven. If reborn among humans, they shall become lords and elders, their clothing and sustenance naturally provided, sparing them from suffering. Wherever this ritual is performed, eight hundred million heavenly beings and jade maidens shall descend to witness it.

If they cannot ascend to heaven or be reborn among humans, I shall dispatch the Radiant Immortal Great Yu, Immortal Qian Zhi, and Immortal Fang Sheng, each leading thirty-nine thousand heavenly soldiers and one hundred thousand mighty warriors, to smite the demon kings, selection officials, and the ten refining spirits, preventing them from ascending. They shall remain as lowly ghosts, forever barred from immortality. This is the decree from the golden mouth of the Most High—once issued, there shall be no pardon. As the Most High commands, so shall it be. If you, lesser demon kings, heed this edict, you may yet ascend. If you enforce it without deviation, but fail to carry out the decree, ninety myriad great spirits wielding crimson staves shall bludgeon the evil ghosts to death. The officials of the Five Paths and the selection spirits of the ten directions must act in their own interest, ensuring the dead are not reported above. If word reaches the heavens, you shall be the first to face judgment—the golden mouth of the Most High shall show no mercy. All shall follow the words of the Most High Perfected. Those who disobey shall see the heads of demon kings and ghost kings shattered into sixteen pieces.\"*\n\nThe Dao spoke: *\"Those who die in the third month of autumn are slain by the Six Harms—great epidemics, water, fire, and misfortunes—ruled by the Lord of the Six Rong. Sixty billion selection spirits shall judge them, their names self-generated. The stars above shall dim, and their fate shall be forever severed. From this day forth, those who die and have this scripture recited for them shall have their spirits refined by the officials of the Five Paths. Those who cannot ascend to heaven are guilty of double-tongued slander, wicked speech, harming or killing others, the Five Inverse Acts, unfilial conduct, deceiving their masters, cursing their fathers, or striking their elders. Whether brother, sister, aunt, uncle, or any kin—all shall enter hell for ninety-one kalpas and never ascend to heaven. The heavenly officials shall not tolerate them. Even if this scripture is recited for them, it shall be of no benefit. Their sin is equal to that of slanderers. Daoists must cultivate goodness, transform others, receive the Three Caverns, revere the scriptures, and practice the Dao. If the dead have this scripture recited for them, the spirits shall issue the decree, and the departed shall ascend directly to heaven. From the years *guiwei* and *xinsi* onward, Daoists who transform and deliver others may escape the great flood of the *jiashen* calamity.\"*\n\nThe Dao spoke: *\"Those who die in the third month of winter are slain by the emissaries of the Luminous Decree for failing to practice the Dao, mocking those who do good, and ridiculing the common folk. They are not human in their three hun-souls and seven po-souls, ruled by the Lord of the Five Di. Fifty myriad selection officials shall distinguish their good and evil, and the stars above shall dim, their fate forever severed. From this day forth, the dead shall have their spirits refined. The Lord of Spirit Refinement commands eight hundred million spirits to ensure the departed ascend to heaven, where heavenly maidens shall welcome them.

      "translated_text": "The Dao is like the sea—how could the sea reject filth and foulness? The great Dharma knows no bounds, and the great person makes no distinctions. When Daoists transform others, take care not to envy one another. Those who envy will have their allotted years seized by the gods and immortals.\n\nThe Dao’s methods are myriad; only the wise expand their thoughts upon them.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this moment, in this place of refining the spirit, I command ninety million heavenly soldiers, eighty thousand warriors of the ten directions, one hundred twenty thousand immortal officials, and three thousand six hundred jade maidens—each wielding a crimson halberd—to strike down all evil ghosts under heaven, to slay those who speak wicked words, and to drive away corrupt officials and thieves. As for all those in white robes who scheme against Daoists, who seek to monopolize or encroach, who deceive these Dharma masters—each shall have their living souls seized and be executed without mercy.\n\nWhen Daoists diligently transform others, the Great Demon King, the Lords of Ghosts, all governing spirits, and the gods who select officials shall pursue the documents on behalf of the deceased. If the departed are confined in the Three Bureaus, condemned to places of suffering, they shall all be reported and released, allowing them to ascend to heaven. Should they fail to remove the deceased from the Three Paths, the officers and soldiers shall be held accountable.\n\nFrom this jiǎxū year onward, among the people of the world who hear the teachings of the Three Caverns, many men and women Daoists will encounter this text—all are those who have descended from heaven. Yet the foolish of the world shall not hear of it.\n\nThe Dao speaks: This *Scripture of Refining the Spirit* is the foremost among scriptures. How is this known? Within this scripture, a single character of the spirit encompasses thirty-six thousand spirits. When people perform purification rites, the spirits hear them. Forty-nine thousand spirits oversee the rites, along with eight thousand Jade Maidens of the Great Beginning and one hundred twenty thousand immortals of Mount Tai, who come to select the deceased. The deceased ascend, and the living gain blessings.\n\nFrom this day forward, Daoists who uphold this Dharma, receive the essentials of the Three Caverns, and teach others to receive them shall themselves enter the ranks of immortals. From the rényǔ year onward, kings, great ministers, regional lords, and officials of two thousand *shi* who receive this scripture—all have bones destined for immortality from past lives. Immortals come to transform them, thus allowing these people to generate faith on their own and encounter great Dharma masters. How fortunate are these men and women! They shall surely ascend as immortals and never fall into the abyss.\n\nThe Dao speaks: If, after a person’s death, the living perform merit on their behalf, the deceased shall regain human form. Once human form is restored, they may ascend to heaven. After ascending to heaven, they shall return to the human realm, where clothing and food come naturally. If they dwell in the world, they shall become teachers of humanity. If they become Daoists and study the Dao, kings shall revere them as masters, and they shall not remain ordinary people. If they become kings, regional lords, officials of two thousand *shi*, or magistrates, their hearts shall constantly dwell on goodness, exhorting others to practice the Dao and personally upholding the Dharma. They shall honor the scriptures of the Three Caverns, revere their masters, and respect the gods, ever steadfast as the sun and moon. Such people shall attain great nobility in this life, passing it down through generations without end.\n\nThe upright appearance of you disciples in this life is also covered by the great Dao. Wealth and nobility, poverty and lowliness—all are decreed by the Dao. Even ugliness is but the qi of the Dao. Simply believe in the Dao with a single heart, for the Dao does not speak falsely.\n\nUpon hearing this Dharma, the countless jade maidens in attendance rejoiced greatly, each performing the three bows and transforming to receive and uphold it on behalf of others.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When people study the Dao, the qi of the Dao runs deep. Though they may not perceive it directly, they should trust the scriptural texts, for the scriptures reveal the Dao. Without scriptures, how could the people of the world know the Dao? The scriptures are the eyes of humanity. Eyes can see far, distinguishing blue from white, good from evil, great from small. Without eyes, nothing is known—so too are the scriptures.\n\nIn studying the Dao, Daoists must first cultivate faith, for only with faith do they gain scriptures. Next, they must serve their masters, for masters guide people. The sages are profoundly distant, hidden and unseen; only masters can be followed. Only those with a predestined affinity for the Dao encounter masters, and thus come to know the Way.\n\nWhen performing purification rites and practicing the Dao, recall your master in every detail. The gods, immortals, and jade maidens shall naturally assist your virtuous heart. The method of purification rites involves practicing the Dao in three periods over one day and two nights.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Long ago, there was a kingdom plagued by tigers and leopards that devoured people on the roads. At that time, a Daoist of the Three Caverns, an official of men and women, entered the mountains to gather herbs. On the way back, they encountered a traveler and asked if there were tigers on the road. The traveler, knowing tigers were present, deceived the Daoist, saying there were none. The Daoists proceeded, and the tiger transformed into a deer, showing no fear or malice toward them. The Daoists, hearing there were no tigers, rejoiced and hastened on their way. The gods protected them, knowing the traveler had deceived the Daoists. With a righteous heart, heaven naturally shielded and guarded them. Thus, the method of Daoists lies solely in establishing faith. Those who maintain faith shall naturally be supported.\n\nThere was Jiao Mai of the Southern Sea, who led eighty people into the mountains to seek immortality. They dwelled there for seven years, and each day a hundred thousand evil ghosts descended to test them. The Daoists and their assembly remained fearless, saying, “We uphold the contract of the Supreme and Boundless. How could you petty ghosts frighten us?” With unwavering faith, the ghosts departed of their own accord. The Daoists were transformed by heavenly maidens and later all ascended as immortals. Thus, Daoists need only maintain faith in their hearts.\n\nThis occurred during the reign of Empress Huì of the Western Jìn, when the Sima clan crossed the Yangtze to the south. In the jiǎzǐ year, the Six Barbarians invaded China. With no ruler in the Central Kingdom, the Sima clan moved to the land of Wú, establishing an emperor on the left bank of the Yangtze. Later, the brothers of the Golden Blade ruled as kings, bringing great joy to the realm. The people thrived, and the Four Barbarians were at peace. By the xīnsì year, the lesser Six Barbarians stirred unrest, which continued through the rényǔ and guǐwèi years, growing ever more chaotic.",

      "translated_text": "In the jiǎshēn year, disaster struck—a flood rising forty *zhang*. Where no water came, great armies would instead descend, with barbarian raiders pressing southward yet causing no harm. The Nine Provinces remained untroubled.\n\nAs the era of the True Lord of the Golden Blade drew to its close, the emperor relocated his court to the land of Cháng’ān, though the earth itself rejected its people. When the time came to depart, the native-born fled first, while sojourners followed after—such was the natural course of heavenly *qi*, not the will of men.\n\nWithin the Daoist gates of the Mysterious Portal, the sovereign revered and upheld the teachings, and the Daoist arts flourished. Even the Six Barbarians submitted. With the advent of the Middle Prime, a radiant king governed, and none harbored the malice of war or blade. The displaced people gradually returned to the central capital, and the realm knew peace, gathering in perfect harmony.\n\nThese events, from the *Yǒngjiā* era of the Western Jìn to the early years of the Sòng, have now come to pass.\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the *rényǔ* and *xīnsì* years, some saw Daoists enter the mountains, cutting off grain to fast, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists spurn worldly glory, enduring hardship in pursuit of their masters, seeking the Dao of immortality. Still others saw Daoists forsake worldly ties, single-mindedly reciting scriptures, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists remain unwed, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists devote themselves to austerities, enduring toil and suffering, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists abstain from food, offering sustenance to their masters, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists spare no expense, commissioning vast numbers of scriptures and images, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists receive numerous registers and covenants, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists abandon their wives and refuse service to kings, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists daily exhorting others, seeking the Dao of immortality. Others saw Daoists constructing many oratories for purification, seeking the Dao of immortality. Some saw Daoists serve their masters without negligence, seeking the Dao of immortality. Still others saw Daoists refrain from deliberate action, seeking the Dao of immortality.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When people practice the Dao and serve their masters, some lounge or slouch before them, show no reverence upon seeing them, and deceive their masters and fellow disciples—ten such claims hold not a single truth. Such people waste your efforts, and both heaven and men will punish them, cutting short their allotted years. Serving a master should be like a minister before the Son of Heaven—how could one dare arrogance or disrespect? Even if a master appears ordinary, they are lords of spirits and gods. If you honor them, divine beings will draw near to you. If you disrespect your master, they will not await your reverence. Yet masters are protected by immortal guardian spirits, and when these spirits grow angry, they punish men. Thus, you Daoists must exercise the utmost caution.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From this time until the *xīnsì* year, red people will appear. These red people stand three *chǐ* and seven *cùn* tall, numbering three hundred million. They dwell in the waters of the Eastern Sea, and among them are Daoists who study the Way. In the Southern Sea, eight hundred thousand people stand nine *chǐ* tall, and they too will come to China to receive the Dao—though some of the time may not recognize them.\n\nThe water-dwellers reside on Crooked Mountain in the sea, with both men and women living beneath the waves. They occasionally emerge onto the Nine Bends Mountain, and many of their Daoist practitioners are exceedingly fair, unmatched anywhere in the world. Their king has three hundred consorts, all of whom receive the Daoist arts, transformed by the immortal Celestial Women of Heaven. The Three Caverns’ great scriptures have spread to the Western Sea, where people stand seventeen *chǐ* tall. They too observe the ways of husband and wife, yet their practice of the Dao differs from that of the people of China.\n\nWáng Fāngpíng and Mágū visit them daily to instruct the people. In this land, too, there are water-dwellers, standing sixteen *chǐ* tall, with many women and few men. Their king stands twenty-nine *chǐ* tall, with three thousand consorts, each bearing thirty-six princely sons. They do not eat the five grains, and celestial beings descend to the waters to craft palaces of gold, jade, and the seven treasures. Their bodies are clad in garments of gold, jade, and the seven treasures. Even if people of China were to encounter them, they would not recognize them. When they travel, they ride the wind and command the rain, possessing the natural *qi* of the Dao.\n\nThese water-dwellers live beneath the waters, though the waters flow above them. The great beasts of the sea are beyond the knowledge of worldly men, and there are also colossal horses and oxen as large as horses, with countless varieties—ten thousand kinds, not to be compared to a single thing. There is nothing like them in the world.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Among the people of the world, there are thirty-six kinds. Ninety thousand *lǐ* beyond the Eastern Sea lies the Red Moon-Branch Mountain, towering nine hundred million *zhàng* high. At its summit dwell beings with three heads sharing a single body, serpentine in form. They do not eat the five grains but feed on humans, insects, deer, birds, and beasts. Their bodies can fly.\n\nThree hundred thousand *lǐ* beyond the Southern Sea stands Bamboo Mountain, rising seven hundred thousand *zhàng* high. Within it lives a one-horned person, six *zhàng* and seven *chǐ* tall, who eats insects, birds, grasses, and trees. Their speech is unintelligible.\n\nSeventy thousand *lǐ* beyond the Western Sea, people stand five *chǐ* tall and consume stones, sand, and water. Their language is incomprehensible.\n\nFifty thousand *lǐ* beyond the Northern Sea lies another mountain, two hundred *zhàng* high. Atop it dwell people with one body and three faces, nine *chǐ* tall. They cannot eat grain but subsist on grasses and seeds. They know nothing of human affairs yet possess the *qi* of yin and yang, husband and wife. Their offspring resemble humans, yet they run as swiftly as flying birds, and tigers and wolves fear them.\n\nThe Dao speaks: These water-dwellers live for three thousand years before dying, while the wild people of the mountains live for three hundred years. They know nothing of the Dao and lack rites and propriety. Only the people of China understand rites and propriety.\n\nChina spans fourteen thousand *lǐ* from east to west and north to south, and its people know the law and study the great Dao. Celestial beings naturally come and go among them. No other lands possess this. The ten directions contain boundless realms—these are the wondrous lands, not the lesser ones. Only the sagely dwell there, and unless one is a Perfected Immortal of the Primordial Truth, none may journey to those places.\n\nThe Perfected Immortal of the Primordial Truth said: \"What land is this, and how many *lǐ* does it span? It is second only to China.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Celestial Worthy addressed the Most High, saying: \"This is Chang’an of China. From the eastern shores to the outskirts beyond Wu and Chu in the south, from Qubing in the west to the deserts in the north—all these are encompassed within the name of China. Yet among the people of today who practice rites and the Dao, only those of the Central Plains, Wu and Chu, Shu and Han, Jianye, and Luoyang truly do so. Men and women who believe in the law find their finest exemplars in the regions of Jingchu, Jiangxia, and Nanyang’s Zhou lands. In the western lands of Congling and Liangzhou, and in the northern commanderies of Xuantu, few study the path of immortality.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"Among all the palaces under heaven, Duyang Palace is supreme, with Mount Wudang ranking second. China contains ninety myriad myriad palaces, each with seventy myriad lesser palaces, and within them dwell thirty million people. Among the forty-nine mountains, the foremost is Mount Duyang. It stretches twelve hundred *lǐ* from east to west, its slopes broad and level, a place of repose where the sun’s valleys lie two hundred *lǐ* deep. In ancient times, a Dharma Master journeyed there to propagate the Dao and its teachings, and the Three Caverns spread forth. Within a decade, those who responded—such as Feixian, Ji Chao, Du Xuanzhi, Xing Tongfa, Li Majin, Zhang Nu, and Liu Shizi—all ascended as masters. Zhongshan holds the dwellings of ancients, now called Xiangchuan. The younger son of King Hui of Zhou attained immortality, and his palace remains there. Many among its people have achieved transcendence, and later generations of Daoists who encounter this Dharma Master’s Three Caverns scriptures shall all attain flight as immortals. The men and women of this land in later ages will also produce many Daoists who meet sagely beings. Why is this so? The ancient immortal Dong Xuanke dwelled there, having long attained the Dao. He would appear to teach the people, and those who believed in the Dao were instructed by these immortals.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In later ages, three thousand Daoists will come from the sea, their brows like a hundred phoenixes. Their palaces and halls lie in the northern mountains of the Western Regions—this was the dwelling of Fuxi’s younger brother. Fuxi originally resided on Mount Qiuchi, also in the Ox Mountain of the Western Regions. Mount Nüwa is another abode of ancient sages, located in Xiangchuan, where thirty thousand immortals dwelled during the Zhou era.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"Among the mountains—Yuntai, Minxuan, Mianzhu, Chishi, Longhe, and Ningshu—ancient immortals dwell in Shu, within the city of Chengdu. In the *renwu* and *xinsi* years, the Three Caverns are supreme on Fenyang Mountain, Bamin Mountain, and the Five Upper Mountains. In Baxi’s Mount Zitong, many ancient immortals reside in its forests and grottoes. Later generations of Daoists, in every lineage, are all transformations of the Jade Immortal of the Mysterious Woman, daily guided by the Dharma Masters who travel there. Traversing the ten directions, they emerge from Mount Fu, Mount Ba, and Mount Jianping, where seven hundred thousand immortals conceal themselves.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In households that uphold the Dao, on the days of the Three Assemblies, one must not fail to visit one’s master. Whenever attending the Three Assemblies, each must present a *shi* of celestial tribute—no shortfall of even a *sheng* is permitted. If the granary officials investigate and find fault, misfortune will befall the household: livestock will die suddenly, undertakings will fail, and pestilence will spread across the land. When attending the Three Assemblies, offering three *liang* of incense is the customary practice. Whenever inviting a master, proper ritual propriety must be observed—nothing may be done in vain. In cases of grave illness, exceptions are made, but one must honor the master as a father, without negligence. Even if one departs for a single night, one must bow to the master; where the master stays, one stays.\"\n\n\"Daoists who sit at the desk to administer their duties hold no distinction of rank. When seated together for inquiry, no future misfortune remains, for the assembled spirits are not resentful. If one has received many scriptures but holds a minor position, the one with more scriptures is deemed greater. To administer major affairs without scriptural foundation is but a minor governance.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"Households that receive the Dao and uphold its laws must reverently offer celestial tribute, annually delivering it to the administration themselves. They must attend to this diligently, lest the master be displeased. The celestial beings will punish you, and even a single *dou* shortfall will not suffice. If the master reports to the celestial courts, the household head will suffer calamity and retribution for failing to honor the master. The foolishness of worldly people leads them to resent the master instead, though the master bears no fault. Every report made above will bring misfortune upon your Daoist community. The same applies to receiving the Dao and its scriptures—one must not act falsely, for even if one cannot fulfill every requirement, one must not be insincere. Many worldly people are impoverished yet unwilling to exert themselves, hoping only for empty gains. When they hear that masters impose many regulations and legal codes, none can comply, and thus they deceive both themselves and others. Daoists who aspire to the Daoist gate must rouse themselves, seek trustworthy offerings, and prepare them with a sincere heart. Only then may the master absolve them—nothing is impossible.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"From this time forward, the celestial yellow writs and contracts, along with the scriptures, shall be supreme. Those who no longer receive them will now attain the Yellow, Red, and Purple Palaces of this world. Those who refuse will be examined by the *qi* near them. Why is this so? The spread of the Three Caverns allows those afflicted by sudden illness to summon a Three Caverns Daoist for treatment. Bowing, burning incense, and invoking the incense fire will naturally disperse all troubles—no memorial is needed, for the celestial courts will comply. In the *renwu* and *xinsi* years, one must not refuse memorials for others. If one composes memorials for worldly people, the household head will be punished by death, and the master will also bear guilt. For each memorial composed, gather the living person’s words according to the matter at hand. Whether three masters, eight masters, five masters, or one master, face east in the upper chamber, present the memorial, pace the void, chant and recite, and then cease. The ghostly soldiers will naturally disperse and rest. Offerings of cakes, fruits, and fine foods must accompany the memorial. From now on, after presenting a memorial, bow twice upon completing the rites.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"When one receives registers, talismans, or contracts, from the rank of general upward, all must be provided for. One must present pledges and tokens according to the law—no leniency is permitted.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Writ of Heaven is to be consumed by eight persons. When conducting rites at the Capital of Scriptures, twelve practitioners are required, each partaking of this as the constant norm. Worldly people, unaware, often perform rites to no avail. When Daoists perform blessings, the sun and moon oversee them—fasting and lecturing take precedence, with reverence for the master held in the heart. Should one act improperly even for a day, showing disrespect to the master, the master’s neglect will not endure past the first day of the month. On the fifteenth day, when paying homage to the scriptures, one must bow to the ten directions and also to the master. To take even one false step incurs thirty-six trials per step, with each sin consigning one to the Inexhaustible Hell, from which escape is impossible, and ascension to the Dao forever forfeit.\n\nThe Dao states: \"From now on, in the years *xinsi* and *renwu*, the Three Caverns shall spread and disseminate throughout the world. The people of the world shall no longer submit memorials. Many men and women will uphold the scriptures and enter the mountains, with women often receiving the teachings—transformed by heavenly maidens. After the passing of *jiashen*, the Dao’s *qi* will flourish, the Six Barbarians will submit in faith, and all immortals will share the same dharma as one family. From the year *renwu* onward, Daoists shall don the three ritual garments: the cap, brown robe, skirt, mantle, staff, and sandals. They shall eat once daily, fasting past noon, abstaining from all meat and wine, and never tasting them. They shall instruct the laity, ensuring no transgressions of the law. Men and women may transmit the teachings, with the wise serving as masters. They shall not raise livestock, for the proper cultivation of life pertains to the self alone. The study of scriptures is their vocation. Those who enter the mountains shall observe monthly fasts, subsisting on vegetables alone. When ten, thirty, or a hundred enter the mountains together, they shall cultivate fields extensively, plant gardens, grow the five vegetables, and construct dwellings on all sides, along with fasting halls and pavilions. No one, two, or three shall dwell alone. Ghosts and spirits deceive the solitary—scriptural dharma cannot be practiced in isolation. In fasting halls with many people, three fasts shall be held monthly, and incense offered thrice daily to bow to the ten directions. Thus do the gods draw near to humanity. If one or two dwell alone in the mountains without establishing rites or building fasting halls, they are no different from beasts or deer in the wild. What distinction is there? One must follow an enlightened master, one rich in skills and scriptural knowledge, for the ascent of even one is auspicious—how much more so for many. Thus, fewer than ten should not reside together, let alone two or five. Such people do not submit to the mountain spirits; the mountain spirits deceive them, and they shall know no fortune.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"When one receives the Yellow Writ and scriptures, they endure long. If one does not follow the master’s transmission, trials will come daily. Illness will afflict them, silkworms and fields will wither, households will suffer misfortune, lifespans will not reach their term, and they will die prematurely. Moreover, one cannot return the master’s talismans and contracts, for the spirits have already entered the body’s organs, causing illness. If one follows the dharma and is transmitted by three masters, no harm shall befall. For Daoists, the mastery of scriptures is paramount—the foundation of ascension to immortality. Thus, among all masters, the scripture master is supreme. Immortals and jade maidens all revere the scripture master. Talismans and contracts are foremost. A Daoist who does not receive all talismans and contracts is no Daoist. One who does not uphold the Three Caverns is no Daoist. To receive only the inner and outer Yellow, Red, and Purple Registers is to be but a minor Daoist. One must receive the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*, the upper talismans, and all related matters to attain the rank of upper immortal.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"When Daoists enter the mountains, they shall honor their masters as they would in the world. If a master dies, they shall visit the grave, bury them with rites, and dress them with proper garments and sashes. They shall weep for seven days and then hold a fast. The fast shall be observed once every seven days for three weeks, then cease. If a disciple dies, the master shall likewise attend to them according to the dharma, without slaughtering animals for offerings—seasonal cakes and fruits suffice. For later generations of Daoists, follow the scriptures in all matters. Those who do not shall become heavenly beings, never to die. All other possessions may be given away.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In later ages, those who master the Three Caverns and encounter this *Scripture of Flying Immortals* shall behold the image of the Most High Lord. Those unable to enter the mountains may instead dwell in distant forests or hills, far from worldly people—ten or five *li* apart. They shall plant abundant vegetable gardens, orchards, and fields. Monthly fasts shall be observed without fail, converting and instructing the foolish to uphold the Three Treasures. Masters, regardless of rank, are honored as noble. Formerly, Luo He, at ninety-eight years, bowed thrice daily to his sixteen-year-old master, attending him with reverence and never showing disrespect. Worldly people, seeing this, sighed: ‘This old man, his temples graying, bows to this young boy!’ Yet the heavenly beings and jade maidens said: ‘This is the elder’s master from a past life. Though young, his wisdom runs deep.’\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"The bond between master and disciple is a profound connection from past lives, akin to that of father and son. All are drawn together from former existences, having sworn oaths across kalpas—this intimacy is not merely of the present. Those bound by evil karma are likewise entangled. If rulers, great ministers, governors, or officials of two thousand bushels now study immortality with these Daoists, it is due to good karma from past lives. Without such deep connections, they could not become masters, disciples, or spiritual kin. Today’s wisdom, love of scriptures, and devotion to study all stem from long practice in past lives. The master-disciple bond is the same, forged over countless ages. They swore to be master and friend, and upon encountering this scripture, now receive it. Those who receive it wisely do so because they studied it in past lives. Though unaware of worldly affairs, they are called wise—this is clear, for their devotion has endured long.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In later ages, epidemics and ghostly soldiers will multiply, slaying people.\"",

In the Daoist method, unless they are master and disciple, the elder is called \"elder brother\" and the younger \"younger brother\"; they may not be addressed as □ or servant. Ghosts kill people—Daoists must be cautious of this.\n\nThose who wish to observe the eight seasonal fasts should choose a place by wild waters, on an island or islet, a pure and secluded site—this is the first offering to the *Xun* direction. The Dao states: \"From the *Renwu* year onward, memorials were submitted again, but the worldly *huangshu* contracts and decrees were no longer received; what the Heavenly Maidens received came without gate or barrier. From now until the *Guiwei* year, after *Jiashen* has passed, the *huangshu* contracts and decrees will no longer be consulted; only this world’s *huangshu* will remain. Those who formally receive the worldly *huangshu* will not ascend as immortals. If men or women have not previously held immortal registers, they may receive the *huangshu* contracts and decrees of the heavens by obtaining at least ten divine youths and one general. If three masters or even one master initiates them, they too become great Daoists and may receive the scriptures and contracts. The people of the world, unaware of the approaching great flood, refuse to accept the Dao—when the time of great disaster comes, they will suddenly perish. Alas, what can be done? If they cannot receive many texts, receiving the *Five Thousand Character Scripture* or the *Scripture of Transforming the Barbarians* is also good.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"From now until the *Renwu* and *Xinsi* years, there will be many women Daoists who receive the Three Caverns. Those entering the mountains will also be mostly female Daoists, while men will be few. The Mysterious Woman often descends, transforming into a young girl to receive disciples in the world. After *Jiashen*, all men and women aged thirteen and above will receive the ten generals, divine youths, and the heavenly *huangshu* contracts and decrees. Why? Because the world will increasingly believe in the Dao.\"",

They swore to be master and friend, and upon encountering this scripture, now receive it. Those who receive it wisely do so because they studied it in past lives. Though unaware of worldly affairs, they are called wise—this is clear, for their devotion has endured long.\"\n\nThe Dao states: \"In later ages, epidemics and ghostly soldiers will multiply, slaying people.\"",

      "translated_text": "Magu, Du Lanxiang, An Qisheng, and Tang Gongfang—all these transformed beings—have each received Daoist teachings, with every school possessing them. Scriptures are supreme, and rituals and lectures abound day and night. In the lands east of the Yangtze, Wu and Chu, as well as in the Shu commanderies of Han and Qin, many practice the Dao.\n\nThe Dao states: \"As the Three Caverns emerge into the world, immortals descend daily. Daoist men and women must diligently study scriptures and contracts, receive many talismans and registers, wholeheartedly believe in goodness, contemplate their masters’ virtues, and make offerings to Daoists. Daoists know no rank—when summoned to dispel misfortune, incense and fire must not be neglected even for a single day. Daoists have their own officers and soldiers for protection, and these must not be disobeyed even for a moment. The officers and soldiers report human transgressions, and heavenly envoys punish those who defy them. At night, the officers within one’s body depart and execute judgment upon the person, causing illness. Prolonged affliction weakens the body. All manner of inauspicious dreams are the work of these officers.\n\nOnce, a female official was summoned to dispel misfortune. She deceived the petitioner, saying, 'Today, the officers within me are in conflict; I cannot perform the rite or dispel your misfortune.' For this deception, two months later, the female official began to hemorrhage and suffered for three years without recovery. A diviner declared, 'You bear a great sin; the heavenly courts are punishing you.' The female official reflected and realized this must be the consequence of her deception. She invited Daoists to perform rituals and repented for a month before recovering.\n\nThe Dao states: 'From now on, admonish future generations: when you receive the Dao, husband and wife must do so together; neither may receive alone. When receiving the *Yellow Writs*, the Three Masters must transmit them, and the Dao must confer the *Yellow Contracts*. Those who fail this will suffer bodily punishment and will not regain human form in future lives—how much less attain immortality? Deceiving others is also forbidden. Those who follow the Dao but neglect incense and fire will surely face punishment, which will extend to their descendants.'\n\nOnce, two neighboring households both received the *Great Contracts of the Yellow Writs* for inner and outer realms. One household had the Three Masters transmit the teachings, practiced the Dao daily, and had Daoists dispel misfortune. Every matter proceeded favorably, never against their wishes. Husband and wife ascended as immortals, protected by heavenly beings. The other household, though they received the teachings, did not undergo transmission by the Three Masters. They copied texts themselves and ceased practicing the Dao. They did not live out their allotted years, and within two years, their entire clan was destroyed—heavenly beings executed them. Those who receive the Dao must follow every word of the scriptures.\n\nThe Dao states: 'People of the world are often foolish. When husband and wife together follow the Dao, jealousy disrupts their practice, preventing them from cultivating the Way. The qi of the Dao and its officers and soldiers grow angry. After death, they enter the *Fire Cart* and *Eight Winds* hells, where they die and are reborn three times a day for seventy thousand kalpas, never regaining human form. Even if they are reborn as humans, they will have human shape but lack human nature—deaf, mute, covered in sores, convulsing, hideous in appearance, their bodies foul and odorous. Others shun them. Daoists, with compassionate hearts, transform people to avoid such corruption. Daoists wear hempen robes and eat plain food, transcribe scriptures, study diligently, and serve their masters. Teach future generations—male and female Daoists—reflect deeply on this.'\n\nThe Dao states: 'The Dao’s teachings are hard to encounter; few do so. Those who encounter them in later ages must revere and uphold them, sparing no wealth. Daoists, as teachers to others, should not greedily take people’s property. Daoists who wish to wear talismans and aspire to immortality must not be stingy. They should forsake wives and children, and not covet livestock or horses. In the past, there were those who gave away wives and children or sold them to receive scriptures—more than one such person. From ancient times to now, only one or two have truly believed in the Dao.'\n\nThe Dao states: 'The *Great Scriptures of the Three Caverns* are the highest of scriptures, yet they do not surpass the *Scripture of Flying Immortals*. Why? The *Scripture of Flying Immortals* was expounded by the Supreme of the Ten Directions’ Great Dao and all immortals and jade maidens who roam and transform the world. It is guarded by countless divine beings, soldiers, and horses. Those who receive it are protected by immortals, and nothing is inauspicious. In the *Xinsi* and *Renwu* years to come, this scripture will spread throughout the world. People will lecture and recite it more than other scriptures. Daoists, through fasting and abstinence, will widely transmit this scripture, for it enables one to become a flying immortal. The Three Caverns allow for many paths—corpse-liberation immortals and earthbound immortals—but this scripture has only flying immortals. This scripture, in twenty scrolls, is revered by heavenly beings, jade maidens, and immortals of the ten directions.'\n\nThe Dao states: 'From now until the *Renwu* and *Xinsi* years, Daoists must urgently convert the world to receive the Dao. Great disasters are imminent; heaven will release epidemic qi, and pestilence will spread, killing many wicked people. Those who perform meritorious deeds will be spared by ghostly soldiers. When the time of the water disaster arrives in those years, Daoists should urge people to build shelters, receive and uphold the true scriptures of the Three Caverns. With the scriptures and contracts upon them, the officers and divine warriors will naturally ward off evil. The waters will come soon, in the *Jiashen* year. If not then, there will be disasters of blades and warfare, and the people will be in turmoil. After the *Jiashen* year, the great flood will sweep everything away. At that time, heaven and earth will be renewed—this world will be no more.\n\nThe Dao states: 'The world is full of wicked people, so the Three Caverns are not widely disseminated. Sentient beings are pitiable, flowing with the mud, and ghostly soldiers execute them. Alas, what can be done? For three days and nights, the Supreme and Wen Shi remained in the Mysterious Capital, contemplating how to deliver sentient beings from life and death. They entered the Golden Casket and retrieved the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Void* and the *Scripture of Flying Immortals* in twenty scrolls, entrusting them to the Grand Dharma Master to transmit to the people of the world.'\"",
