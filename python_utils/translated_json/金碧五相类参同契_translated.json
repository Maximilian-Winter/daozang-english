Only then may they don the **Daoist** robes of the ten directions, still the body of chaotic thoughts, and have the disciples sweep the five-directional altar within the three-tiered square *fangzhang* (altarpiece), place the incense burner, and with pure intent, burn incense while invoking the **Three Pure Ones**. Four daggers stand erect, eight mirrors hang suspended.\n\nThe scholar, holding a thousand *liang* of gold, kneels and solemnly vows, pledges, and swears before transmitting the profound secrets of the **Daoist** scriptures. Only those who cherish the **Way** with sincerity, refining the **qi** of the **Dragon** and **Tiger** (Lead and Mercury), may attain the path to **Celestial Immortality**. Yet if encountered by thieves, rogues, or those lost in vain imaginings, the **Dao** must not be divulged—such recklessness invites eternal damnation.\n\nOnly the virtuous—those who honor parents, revere the **Dao**, cherish the **Way**, and trust in the worthy—may be initiated. Unauthorized transmission brings retribution upon seven generations. For the **Great Dao** is the origin of heaven and earth, the progenitor of **Yin** and **Yang**, the foundation of transformation.\n\n---\n**Scroll One: *Jinbi Wu Xiang Lei Tantong Jing***\nAnnotated by Yinyang Changsheng\n\n**Exposition Chapter (1)**\n\nOf old, the *Paramartha Tantong Jing* (Arcane Concordance) was spoken by the **Wei** sage, where *\"Param\"* means **separation**, *\"Tong\"* means **harmonization**, and *\"Qi\"* means **union**. To those who study the **Dao** of the **Way**, this text reveals the hidden mechanisms of the **Dao** and recognizes the primordial roots.\n\n*\"Qi\"* (union) signifies the convergence of **Celestial Immortality**’s secrets with the transformations of **Yin** and **Yang**’s creative forces—this is the **Upper Concordance**. Within lies the **True Speech of Eternal Life**, elucidating the obscure yet luminous essence of the **Five Phases** in their authentic form.\n\nThe primordial roots of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations:\n**Yin** and **Yang** emerge as black generating white—this is the **One** of water. Water generates metal, the **Three**. Water is said to **separate** from **Kun** (Earth), for Earth is **Yin**, **Yin** is female, female is mother, and mother originates from **Kun**, bearing vitality—thus **Kun**.\n\nMetal resides in the northwest, belonging to **Qian** (Heaven), as **Yang**, male, father, born from **Kan** (Water). This is the primordial source of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations.\nThus the scripture states:\n*\"The **Li** (Fire) official conceals true water within its form,\nThe **Kan** (Water) gate harbors hidden authentic gold.\"*\n\nWhen **Qian** (Heaven) begets three males and **Kun** (Earth) three females, their interplay forms the **Eight Trigrams**, nurturing each other in cycles of **Eight Eights**—the **Great and Small Numbers** of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations.\n\n**Do not ask others—ask only yourself.**\nFor the **Dao** of refining the **Way** and attaining true essence lies within one’s own body. Enlightened sages comprehend this profound truth. To seek externally is to stray forever from the **Dao**.\n\nMany who do not grasp the **Dao**’s scriptures wander in confusion, searching outside themselves for truth. When will they ever attain the **Dao**’s essence?\n\nThe **Way** is singular and absolute—yet some still chase the **Five Metals** and **Eight Stones**, laboring to forge the elixir. How could such efforts ever succeed?\n\n**Cinnabar, black tin, and realgar**—when refined in the furnace, they yield **Erxi Dan** (Two Radiant Elixirs).\n**Cinnabar** is not the common cinnabar of the world.\n**Mercury** is not the common mercury of the world.\n**Black tin** is the mineral smelted from ore—this is true **Lead**. Within **Lead** lies its own refinement, its own **Silver**.\n\nThe sages take **cinnabar, black tin**, and place them in the furnace, using **realgar** as a regulator, and refine them into **Erxi Dan**. **Realgar** is not the common realgar of the world; its source is the **Wudu Mountains**, where it forms through water’s alchemy. Only with this **realgar** can the elixir be perfected.\n\n**Cinnabar** originates from the **Southern Palace**, born in the **Bing** and **Ding** (Fire) phases.\n**Black tin** comes from the **Northern Palace**, generated in the **Ren** and **Gui** (Water) phases.\n**Realgar** emerges from the **Central Palace**, thriving in the **Wu** and **Ji** (Earth) phases.\nWhen these three substances are combined in the furnace and refined into **Erxi Dan**, transformations multiply.\n\nThe **Daoist scriptures** say:\n*\"Medicine is not medicine; the furnace is not a furnace.\nTo complete the **Four Symbols**, to fulfill the **Five Phases**—\nMedicine and furnace do not depart from the body.\nSeek not outside.\"*\n\nTo seek externally is to distance oneself from **Immortal** attainment.\n\nWhen **cinnabar** and **black tin** are gently refined with **realgar**, the elixir is named **Erxi Dan**.\n\nThe **elixir** is refined with **Wen** and **Wu** (Civil and Martial) **Fires**,\nfirst transforming into **White Snow**—\nits form in the **furnace** is like goose down or snowflakes,\nhalf red and half white in hue.\n\nWhen **Realgar** restrains it, it becomes **Yellow Sprout**,\nlike seeds planted in the earth,\ngaining **Xī** (radiance) and sprouting.\n\n**Realgar** is **Earth**—\nEarth nurtures all things.\nWhen all things die and return to Earth,\nit is the **Five Phases** reverting to **One**,\nand all matters conclude.\n\nLet the **River Vehicle** (Hé Chē) be altered at will,\nseven returns and reversals complete the **Xian** (completed) transformation.\nSee its **Yin** (Wood), recognize its **Zhen** (Earth).\nIn the **truth**, it is called **Jin** (Metal).\nMetal can subdue Wood—\nthis is the **return** (Fan).\nInternally, it governs the **lungs** and **liver**;\nexternally, it is the **Bundle West** (Shù Xī).\n**Jin** is **essence** (Jīng), Wood is **fluid** (Jīn).\nEssence and fluid combine—\nthis is the **cinnabar** (Dānshā).\n\nEssence descends from the **Li** (Fire) **Palace** and is produced,\nfluid ascends from the **Kǎn** (Water) **Palace** and is born.\nThe **Li** and **Kǎn** **Palaces**—\nthis is the **furnace of Water and Fire in Harmony** (Shuǐ Huǒ Jì Jī Dǐng).\n\nThe **River Vehicle**—\nthis is the **true radiance of the Northern Palace**.\nWhen it enters the **Bundle West** (Shù Xī) **Jia** (Wood) **position**,\n**Jia** and **Yǐ** (Metal) form the **Jin Hua** (Metal Flower),\na shift from **Kǎn** (Water) to **Zhèn** (Thunder/Earth).\n\nAfter nine transformations, the **Purple Metal Sand** (Zǐ Jīn Shā) is formed,\nilluminating our home with **gold and silver**.\n\n**Lead** and **Mercury** (Qiān Gōng) combine with **Realgar**,\nrefined into the **Great Medicine** (Dà Yào),\nrevealing the **Heaven and Earth** (Buàn Kūn).\n\nThe **Yang** (male) **stem** weighs **192 chǐn** (铢),\ntotaling **384 chǐn**—\nthis is the measure of one **jīn** (斤).\nThe **Metal** weighs **8 liǎng** (两),\nthe **Silver** weighs **8 liǎng**—\nthis is the **Returned Cinnabar** (Huán Dān),\nnamed **Purple Metal Sand**.\n\nThe **Yang** (male) **stem** is **192 chǐn**,\nthe **Yin** (female) **stem** is **192 chǐn**,\ntotaling **384 chǐn**—\nthis is called the **Returned Cinnabar**.\n\nThe **Great Medicine** naturally refines itself,\nand when a person obtains this **elixir**,\ntheir home is filled with **gold, silver, and seven treasures**.\n**Black Crow** (Wū Sài) becomes **Phoenix** (Fèng),\n**Serpent’s bait** (Shé È) turns into **Dragon**.\n\nWhen consumed by humans,\nit grants **long life and immortality**,\nallowing them to roam the world—\nthese are called **Earthly Immortals** (Dì Xiān),\nwho later, after **800 lifetimes** (Bā Bǎi Xíng),\nascend as **Divine Immortals** (Shén Xiān).\n\n**Recognizing the Roots and Sprouts of Medicines (Chapter Two)**\nBefore practicing the **Dao** (Way),\none must discern its **medicines**—\nseeing the **sprouts** (Miáo) to recognize the **roots** (Gēn).\nIf a person cultivates their body and nourishes their life,\nthey must know **loss and gain** (Sǔn Yì),\ndiscerning the **roots and sprouts** of the **medicines**,\nwith **black and white** clearly distinguished,\nradiant and supple in appearance.\n\n**Discarding the key** (Qiè) is called **root belt** (Gēn Dài).\nLeft is **discarding** (Qiè), right is **key** (Suǒ).\nBeneath the **Dan Tian** (Elisir Field) of a person,\nthere is a **discarding** (Qiè),\nwithin which are stored the **roots of the sun and moon** (Rì Yuè Zhī Gēn),\nday and night revolving,\nthrough the **four seasons** (Sì Shí Zhōu Zhā).\n\nRefined in the **three Dan Tians** (Sān Tiān),\nthis is the **vital essence of the Three Souls** (Sān Hún Zhī Yào),\nthe source of the **Great Medicine** (Dà Yào) and **Golden Elixir** (Jīn Dān).\n\nCalled **Supporting the Spleen and Calming the Souls** (Fú Líng Ān Hún),\n**Ginseng** (Rén Shēn) stabilizes the **Spirit** (Pò).\nThese are not mere **herbs** (Cǎo).\n\n**Supporting the Spleen** (Fú Líng) is black on the outside and white within,\n**Ginseng** (Rén Shēn) is red and yellow externally,\nwrapped in green and white—\nthese are the **visible roots and sprouts** of the **medicines**.\n\nTo cultivate and nourish,\none must recognize the **true roots and sprouts**—\nthis is the **mystery**.\n\nWhen collecting,\nuse the **true essence of the Two Eights** (Èr Bā Zhēn).\nThe **medicines** inherently contain **true butter and milk** (Zhēn Sū Lào).\n\nThe **Two Eights** (Èr Bā) refer to **Mǎo** (Wood) and **Yǒu** (Metal),\nalso called **Metal and Wood in Mutual Subduction** (Jīn Mù Xiāng Kè).\n\nThe upper **Mǎo** (Wood) is the **Dragon** (Lóng),\nthe **Dragon** being **blood** (Xuè).\nThe lower **Yǒu** (Metal) is the **Tiger** (Hǔ),\nthe **Tiger** being **marrow** (Suǐ).\n\nWhen **marrow and blood** harmonize,\nthis is called **butter and milk** (Sū Lào).\n**Butter and milk**—\nthis is the **essence and radiance of the sun and moon** (Rì Yuè Zhī Jīng Huá).\nA practitioner who attains this substance\ncan achieve **long life, perpetual youth, and immortality** (Cháng Shēng Jiǔ Shì Bù Sǐ),\nascending as a **Divine Immortal** (Shén Xiān)\nand passing through the **Southern Palace** (Nán Guān).\n\nThis is when the **sun and moon** generate **Kǎn** (Water) **height** (Gāo),\nforming **Water and Fire in Harmony** (Shuǐ Huǒ Jì Jī).\nThe foundation is of the **Lead and Mercury** (Qiān Gōng) **type**.\n\nThe **Civil and Martial Fires** (Wén Wǔ Huǒ) are the **functions of the four seasons** (Sì Shí Gōng).\n**Closing and inhaling** (Bì Xī) to **absorb radiance** (Nà Xī),\nthe **nine-one** (Jiǔ-Yī) measure in restraint—\nthis is the **upper collection of Wood and Fire fluids** (Jīn),\nthe **lower extraction of Metal and Water essences** (Jīng),\nentering the **Central Palace** (Zhōng Guān),\nusing **Earth** to combine into the **Great Medicine**.\n\n**Slow pounding** (Màn Dǎo) must be precise in measure.\n**Slow pounding**—\nthis is the **sequence of operations** (Gōng Chéng).\n**Closing and inhaling** to **store and contract** (Cún Suō),\ndrawing and absorbing to obtain **Earth** (Tǔ),\ncombining and inhaling to form the **Fire** (Huǒ) **pattern** (Fāng)—\nthen refining the **cinnabar** (Dānshā),\nforming the **medicine’s body** (Yào Tǐ),\nwhich naturally emits **divine light** (Shén Guāng).\nThe complexion becomes joyous and radiant,\n**reverting aging to youth** (Fǎn Lǎo Huán Tóng),\nthe body strong and light,\nmovement swift as a galloping horse,\nstrength doubled as usual,\nhearing sharp and vision clear.\nWhen the **virtue/power** (Dé) is fulfilled,\n**purple mist** (Zǐ Wù) envelops the feet,\nand wherever they go,\nthe **Three Souls, Seven Spirits, Five Zàng Organs, Six Fǔ Entrails, Six Ding, Six Jia** (Sān Hún Qī Pò Wǔ Zàng Liù Fǔ Shí Dīng Shí Jiǎ),\nand the **land spirits** (Tǔ Dì) follow.\n**Demons and malevolent entities** (Wǎng Liǎng Jiān) see them\nand retreat, not daring to approach or harm.\n\n**Black Crow** (Wū Sài) becomes **Phoenix** (Fèng),\n**Serpent’s bait** (Shé È) turns into **Dragon**.\nWhen the **Golden Elixir** (Jīn Yè Huán Dān) is formed,\nthe **Vermilion Bird** (Zhū Què) naturally manifests as **Phoenix**.\nThe **perfectly harmonized practitioner** (Tōng) spontaneously transforms\ninto the **victorious serpent** (Shèng Shé) as **Dragon**.\n\nWhen the **harmony** (Tōng) aligns with the **intent** (Yì),\nthey ascend on **cloud dragons** (Yún Lóng),\ngaining the ability to **ride the phoenix** (Kua Fèng).\n\nIf there are those who practice the **Dao**,\nthey need only **resolve to refine Lead and Mercury** (Zhì Liàn Qiān Gōng Zào Huà),\nendlessly transforming.\nWhen the **Golden Elixir** (Jīn Dān) is formed,\n**fire cannot burn it** (Huǒ Bù Néng Shāo),\n**water cannot drown it** (Shuǐ Bù Néng Nì),\nand even as an **Earthly Immortal** (Dì Xiān),\nthey face no obstacles.\n\n**Chapter on Operations (Chapter Three)**\nThe **operations** are performed in **winter, summer, and the transitional seasons** (Dōng Xià Jì Chūn Qiū).\nThe **four seasons** (Sì Shí)—\nthese are the **beginning of spring, summer, autumn, and winter** (Lì Chūn, Lì Xià, Lì Qiū, Lì Dōng),\nwhich mark the **four symbols** (Sì Xiàng) as their **heads** (Tóu).\n\n**Spring** spans **72 days** (Qī Shí Èr Rì),\n**Summer** spans **72 days**,\n**Autumn** spans **72 days**,\n**Winter** spans **72 days**—\nthis is the **Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water** (Mù Huǒ Jīn Shuǐ)\n**Four Symbols** governing the **four beginnings** (Sì Mèng Tóu).\n\nThe **Yin-Yang transformations** of great and small numbers—\n**Yin (寅) and Shen (申)** are **Metal and Wood** (金木),\nwhere **mutual destruction and generation** (相刑相生) occur.\nTheir **physical forms** (体) together span **388 years** (三百八十八年之数).\nUsing the **four beginnings** (四孟) sparingly,\nin **Winter**, **four or five days** (四五日) suffice—\nthis yields **190 years**, the **greater reckoning** (大数).\nFor lesser operations (功小者),\nusing the **four seasons daily** (日用四时) also yields **190 cycles** (一百九十数).\nCalculating the **Yin-Yang transformations** (阴阳造化) of great and small numbers—\nthis is the **ineffable work of the divine and sagely** (神明不测之功).\n\n**Wei (巳) and Hai (亥)** mark the **return to the Eight Trigrams’ origin** (还八卦头).\n**Wei (巳)** is **Fire** (火),\ncalled the **fourth month** (四月), the **pure Yang body** (纯阳之体),\nits **Trigram** corresponding to **Qian (乾)**, the **Heaven**.\n**Hai (亥)** is **Water** (水),\ncalled the **tenth month** (十月), the **pure Yin body** (纯阴之体),\nits **Trigram** corresponding to **Kun (坤)**, the **Earth**.\n**Heaven and Earth unite** (天地相合),\nwith **six Yin and six Yang** (六阴六阳) fully present.\n\nFrom **Zi (子) to Wei (巳)**, half the year’s count—\nthe **initial *Fu* (复) Hexagram of Earth Thunder** (地雷《复》) begins,\nwith **six Yang lines** (六阳爻) complete.\nFrom **Wu (午) to Hai (亥)**, half the year’s count—\nthe **initial *Gou* (遘) Hexagram of Heaven Wind** (天风《遘》) begins,\nwith **six Yin lines** (六阴爻) complete.\n\nThe **Great Elixir** (金丹大药) manifests in its **nine returns** (九还),\ncalled **Water and Fire in Perfect Union** (水火既济).\n**Water and Fire** contend yet are **controlled** (相克而制之),\nthe **root essence** (根元) attaining its **true form** (正体)—\nthe **Great Elixir** is complete (大药成).\n\n**Daily conjunctions** (日会) of **Jia (甲), Geng (庚), Ren (壬), and Bing (丙)**—\n**mutual destruction and containment** (相克相包) seek the **Four Symbols** (四象).\n**Jia (甲)**, the **Wood position** (木位), in the **northern bundle** (束北),\nreaches the **28th day** of the month—\nhere, **Earth consumes its ally** (地而丧朋),\n**Yang arises, Yin perishes** (阳生阴灭).\n**Geng (庚)**, the **Metal position** (金位), in the **southwest** (西南),\nappears on the **third day** of the month in **Geng’s domain** (庚地)—\nhere, **Earth gains its ally** (地而得朋),\n**Yin arises, Yang perishes** (阴生阳灭).\n**Ren (壬)** is **Water**, **Yang Water** (水是阳), born from the **Sun’s spirit** (日魂).\n**Bing (丙)** is **Fire**, **Yin Fire** (是阴), born from the **Moon’s shadow** (月魄).\nThe **Moon’s shadow** (月魄) is **Metal’s radiance** (金之熙), **Yin within Yang** (阳中阴).\nThe **Sun’s spirit** (日魂) is **Wood’s radiance** (木之熙), **Yang within Yin** (阴中阳).\n\nThus, **Yin-Yang transformations** (阴阳造化) originate in **Kan (坎) and Li (离)**—\n**mutual destruction and containment** (相克相包),\n**reciprocal concealment** (互相包藏).\n**Ren (壬) generates Jia (甲)**, **Bing (丙) generates Geng (庚)**—\nthis is the **Four Symbols’ pursuit** (四象求),\nentering the **Central Furnace** (入官鼎).\nThe **Great Elixir** (金丹大药) then **transforms** (方变成).\n\nAs the **Classics say**:\n**Wood governs the Azure Dragon** (木主青龙),\n**Metal forms the White Tiger** (金作白虎),\n**the Sun is the Vermilion Bird** (日为朱雀),\n**the Moon is the Dark Warrior** (月为玄武).\nWhen the **Four Symbols converge** (四象交会),\nthey enter the **Central Furnace** (入於中官).\n**Eternal Life** never departs from **Wu (戊) and Ji (己), the Earth** (长生不离於戊己土),\nas **Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire** coalesce into **dust** (金木水火以成尘).\nOne does not know who first takes dominion—\n**the common folk misunderstand the Sage’s words** (世人不晓圣人言),\n**using their own shallow judgments** (自用胸襟不师古),\n**misleading others along erroneous paths** (更将错路指迷人),\n**unaware their bodies crumble to ash** (不觉身姐为灰土).\n\nI **urge the alchemist** to refine the **True Tiger** (劝人炼药须真虎),\n**Yang embracing Yin** (阳得阴兮自并互).\nWhen the **work is complete**, it relies on the **Ninefold City** (九重城),\n**consuming it for a thousand days** (饵之千日) to **ascend** (身腾举).\n\nThis is the **Four Symbols’ pursuit** (四象求) of **Ren (壬), Bing (丙), Jia (甲), and Geng (庚)**—\nthe **true Metal, Wood, Water, Earth, and Fire** (真金、木、水、土、火是的也).\n**Water and Fire** **reverse in the True Furnace** (水火翻易真鼎器),\nthe **River Vehicle** (河车) **turns**, while **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** remain.\nThe **Four Symbols** emerge from **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** (四象生於戊己),\nfor **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** are **preeminent** (为尊).\nThe **Four Symbols** rely on **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** to **complete** (而成).\nWithout **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)**, the **Four Symbols** cannot form,\nand the **Five Phases lack a master** (五行无主).\n**Wu (戊)** is **Earth**, **Ji (己)** is **dung** (粪),\nyet **dung and Earth unite** as **one virtue** (相合为一德).\nThe **Classics say**:\n**Heaven attains One and becomes clear** (天得一者清),\n**Earth attains One and becomes tranquil** (地得一者宁),\n**the Elixir attains One and is complete** (药得一者成),\n**Man attains One and becomes divine** (人得一者灵).\n**Earth is the sovereign of all things** (土为万物主),\n**all things are born from Earth and return to Earth** (万物得土而生，万物因土而死归土).\n\nThe **Four Symbols**—**Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire**—\nenter the **Central Furnace** (来入中官),\nonly then **returning to the Vessel** (方归鼎器).\nThe **Vessel** (鼎器) is the **marrow of the Elixir’s body** (丹药体中髓).\nThe **Azure Dragon and White Tiger** emerge from **south and north** (青龙白虎生南北),\n**beasts subduing one another within the Furnace** (禽制相伏鼎中游).\n\nThe **Azure Dragon**, **Master of Wood** (青龙木之主), is **Lead** (为铅),\nborn from the **northern Ren (壬) and Gui (癸)** (从北方壬癸#2中而生).\nThe **White Tiger**, **Master of Metal** (白虎金之主), is **Mercury** (为汞),\nproduced from the **southern Bing (丙) and Ding (丁)** (从南方丙、丁而产).\n**Mercury** is born from **#3 Cinnabar** (朱砂中),\n**externally red** (外赤应阳), **internally Mercury** (内生水银是阴).\n**Lead** is mined from **stone** (产於石中),\n**internally and externally black** (内外黑应阴), refined into **silver** (炼出白银是#4阴).\n**Lead** is **essence** (津), called **Jade Nectar** (玉液), or **Hua Pool Water** (华池水).\n**Mercury** is **spirit** (精), called **Indigo** (曾青), or **Law Water** (法水).\nThese **two substances** are **one in origin** (二物本一体),\nuntil the **Mid-Autumn Festival** (中元朝), when the **Red Emperor** (赤帝) **allocates them** (分配归於上下).\nThe **upper is Lead, Yang** (上者铅是阳),\nthe **lower is Mercury, Yin** (下者汞是阴).\nWhen **Yin and Yang unite**, they yield the **Yellow Mother** (得黄婆),\nand the **Great Elixir is formed** (方成大药)—\nthis is the **Dragon and Tiger’s play within the Furnace** (此是龙虎鼎中游).\n\n**The Golden Lord** (金公) **seeks the Yellow Mother** (自觅黄婆),\n**inquiring how to unite with the Jade Maiden** (问要与玉女会绸缪).\nThe **Golden Lord** is named **Yingxiong** (婴兄).\nThe **Jade Maiden** is named **Mercury** (名日汞也).\nWhen **Lead and Mercury unite** (铅汞相合),\nthey enter the **Central Furnace** (入中官鼎内).\nThe **Furnace** is the **Yellow Mother** (鼎者，黄婆也).\nIt is called the **Dan Field** (丹田),\n**Earth generating Five** (土从一生五),\n**Five returning to One** (五合於一) — **the Sixfold Cycle** (谓之六).\nThis is the **essence of the Sun and Moon’s radiance** (日精月华),\nthe **Sun’s spirit and Moon’s shadow** (日魂月魄),\nthe **silver exterior and gold interior** (银表金裹之体).\n\n---\n**Chapter on Lead and Mercury (Chapter Four)**\n**Lead and Mercury** share a **single origin** (并生时本体).\n**Lead and Mercury** are the **root of the Lower Dan Field** (下元命门之根),\nproduced in the **abandoned key** (弃钥中),\n**born in the kidneys** (生於肾).\nThe **left kidney governs Ren (壬)**, the **right kidney governs Gui (癸)**.\nThe **two kidneys** (肾之二) **unite as one** (合为一体).\nThis is **Lead and Mercury’s single origin** (是铅汞本一体),\n**one representing Lead**, the **other Mercury** (一象铅，一象汞).\n**Ascending and descending**, they **separate** (上下飞分),\n**south and north** (南北) **pair with Kan and Li** (离官坎户配相随),\n**reversing above and below** (上下翻变) with **Lead and Mercury**.\n**Mercury** is **Yang**, **Wood** (为木), also called the **Infant** (婴儿),\nor the **Sun’s spirit** (日魂), or the **Sun’s essence** (日精).\n**Lead** is **Yin**, **Metal** (为金), also called the **Bride** (媳女).\nThus, the **Classics say**:\n**Kan (坎) is male, Li (离) is female** (坎男离女为夫妇),\n**Water and Fire are the Great Elixir** (水火为大药).\nThis is the **true male and true female** (真男真女),\nthe **true Water and true Fire** (真水真火),\nthe **true Lead and true Mercury** (真铅真汞) —\nthe **essential divine operations** (要妙神用也矣).\n\n**Gold and Silver** are the **true essence** (金银便是真宗的),\n**reversed above and below** (上下翻作两般名).\n**Gold and Silver** are the **true radiance of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之正熙),\ncalled the **upper and lower strings** (谓之上下两弦).\n\n「On the third day of each month, the moon appears at **Geng** (庚);\non the twenty-eighth day, it appears at **Jia** (甲);\non the eighth and twenty-third days, it manifests at the **Li** (离) and **Kan** (坎) positions respectively.\nIt is also said:\n**The luminous transformations of Yin and Yang** (显阴阳变转) give rise to the **cosmic shaping** (造化成形),\n**fullness in the first fifteen days** (前十五日而圆) and **waning in the latter fifteen days** (后十五日而缺).\nThis is called the **foundation of the twenty-eighth** (此谓二八之基),\nwhere **Yin and Yang’s numerical lines are complete** (阴阳数爻俱备).\nThe remaining days have **augmentations, diminutions, excesses, and reversals** (增亏盈反),\nand are called the **□** [missing character] **Child-Midday cycle** (子午日分阴阳之足数).\nThe **Classics say**:\n**The souls of the sun and moon** (日月魂魄) arise from **Kan and Li** (因生坎离).\nThis is the **true interaction of Gold and Wood** (金木之□),\n**Water and Fire** (水火) forming their essence.\n**Conceiving the embryo** (感胞胎), **nurturing the Elixir** (养还丹),\n**changing hue and altering appearance** (以变色动容),\n**results in the Four Divine Elixirs** (成为四神丹), the **Four Transformations’ Medicine** (四转之药).\n\n**Yin and Yang’s reversed transformations** (阴阳翻变) traverse the **Nine Domains** (九域),\n**Kan and Li’s positions** (坎户离宫) manifest their **interactive changes** (显变通).\n**Seeking the true radiance of Yin and Yang** (探阴阳之正熙),\n**preserving the essence and vital fluids** (存精津) yields completion.\nThe **key is the seven-eight cycle** (要用七八之数),\nemploying the **four times of the Tiger, Monkey, Dragon, and Pig** (寅、申、巳、亥).\n**Refining Fire

(白马牙).\n\nYet with the **Daoist Pill** (刀圭),\n**natural Jade Nectar** (玉液) is called **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽),\nand **Cinnabar Elixir** (丹砂) is achieved.\n**Seven returns** (七返) use **Tiger** (寅) as the head,\n**corresponding to the Hexagram of *Tai*** (卦应地天《泰》),\nwhere **three Yin and three Yang lines intersect** (三阴三阳交遘),\ncalled **internal resonance with the liver** (内应其肝),\n**external manifestation as Wood** (外象於木).\n**Tiger** (寅) is the **fourth of the Months** (四孟), called the **longest** (谓其长).\n**Zhen** (震) is among them, and **Tiger** (寅) may be used,\nbut **not Dragon** (卯) should be employed.\n**Monkey** (申) corresponds to the Hexagram of *Pi* (卦应天地《否》),\ncalled **the negation of Yin and Yang** (阴阳否极泰来),\n**when *Tai* reaches its peak, *Pi* arrives** (泰极否至),\n**interacting harmoniously with the times** (交泰随时),\n**three Yang and three Yin lines return and unfold** (三阳三阴返覆而生),\n**internally resonating with the lungs** (内应其肺),\n**externally manifesting as the Metal of the West** (外应其西方金).\n**Monkey** (申) in the **West** (西位) is **Metal** (金), also belonging to the **Months** (孟);\n**Dui** (兑) is the **second of the Months** (仲), and **Monkey** (申) may be used,\nbut **not You** (酉) should be employed.\n**The Dragon does not lie dormant** (龙不伏), **the Tiger moves freely** (虎自走).\n**Tiger and Monkey** (寅申) are the **Seven Returns’ Spirit Sand** (七返灵砂),\n**three transformations and returns** (三变转还).\n\nThe **Nine Domains** (九域) are formed by the **Nine Colors** (九色),\n**arising from the gate of transformation** (变转之门从□生):\n**White, Yellow, Red, Black, Green, Blue, Scarlet, Purple** (白、黄、赤、徘、绿、碧、红、紫).\n**Nine transformations** (变转九色) are called **Nine Returns** (九还),\nknown as the **Nine Domains** (号为九域).\n**From the Heart and Kidney’s reversal** (从心肾翻成),\nit is said: **Sun in Li’s position, Moon in Kan’s** (日离官坎户).\n**The Heart** (心) belongs to **Yin** (阴), **the Kidney** (肾) to **Yang** (阳),\nthus it is called **Yin and Yang’s reversed transformation** (阴阳翻变).\n**The souls of the sun and moon** (日月魂魄) are treasured by **Daoist Immortals** (仙人惜),\n**gathering to refine the Three Fields** (会炼三田) depending on **Precious Essence** (依宝珍),\n**the Daoist Pill** (刀圭) being the **true treasure** (自要仙人吃).\n**Sun’s soul and Moon’s spirit** (日魂月魄) are the **true essence** (精) and

(是人根柢),\nhence the reverence.\n\n**Gathering to refine the Three Fields** (会炼三田) means\n**the true essence** (熙) **interacting within the Three Furnaces** (往来於三官),\n**refining the Three Corpses** (炼三尸) to **self-annihilation** (而自亡灭),\n**returning the Elixir** (却还丹) to become **Purple Gold** (紫金),\n**perfectly round, an inch in diameter** (方圆径寸),\n**weighing a pound** (可重一斤),\ncalled **the true essence of Yin and Yang** (阴阳正熙结成真金).\nThis is called the **true Daoist Pill** (真刀圭),\n**the Central Furnace’s vessel** (是中鼎器谓之刀圭).\nIt is also called **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽),\n**fragrant and savory** (有香味),\n**like chrysanthemum yet yellow** (若菊花而黄色),\n**a true person’s delight** (真人地仙俱所好吃用),\nhence it is called the **Daoist Pill** (故日刀圭),\n**the red blade, the white standard** (刀赤圭白).\n\n---\n**Chapter Five on Sun’s Soul and Moon’s Spirit** (日魂月魄章第五):\n**Sun’s Soul and Moon’s Spirit emerge from Kan and Li** (日魂月魄出坎离),\n**Sun’s Soul and Moon’s Spirit** (日月魂魄) are the **true essence of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之熙结).\n**Sun’s Soul** (日魂) **ascends from Kan’s position** (从坎户而上),\n**manifesting as Wood’s essence** (应其铅) and forming **Jade Nectar** (为之玉液),\n**located atop the Hua Gai** (在华盖之上).\n**The souls emerging within the orifices** (在窍中所出日魂月魄),\n**produced from the Three Furnaces** (从三官而产),\n**descend to manifest as Mercury** (是熙下应其汞),\nforming **Golden津** (为之金津).\n**The four seasons interact and circulate** (四时上下来往交感),\n**never leaving the Three Fields** (不离三田),\n**descending to the Lower Elixir Field** (下归下丹田),\n**the Tail Vein Cavity** (尾闲穴),\n**three cavities

(化为金),\n**bone marrow transforming into flowing pearls** (骨髓变为流珠).\n\n**When Jia meets Geng** (甲会庚时), **the divine mechanism shifts** (神机变也).\n**The returned Elixir** (还丹) **enters Ren and Bing** (壬丙入希夷).\n**Bing** (丙) is **Fire** (火), **Ren** (壬) is **Water** (水),\n**Water and Fire** (水火) **are the completed *Ji Ji* Hexagram** (为既济).\n**The Four Furnaces contain the Great Medicine** (鼎四中大药已成),\nhence it is called **Hi Yi** (希夷).\n**Hi Yi** (希夷) is the **root of the Five Phases** (之五行之根),\n**arising from a single dou measure** (从一斗而生),\n**transforming through Nine Returns** (化通九转),\nalso called **from Earth’s congealing** (从土结),\n**known as the returned Elixir** (谓曰还丹).\n**Jia** (甲) is **Wood** (木), **Geng** (庚) is **Metal** (金),\n**Metal and Wood mutually restraining** (金木相刑) **achieves perfection** (乃成真).\n**Earth, Metal, and Wood** (土、金、木) are the **foundation of the medicine** (药之本也).\n\n**When a person awakens** (人之悟也),\n**they realize the sacred principle** (悟其圣理),\n**and act to refine Lead and Mercury** (动行修於铅汞),\n**thus harmonizing the divine mechanism** (自合神机).\n**The *Fu* line** (《复》爻) **and *Gou* form** (《遘》体) are the **two mechanisms** (是两机).\n\n---\n**Gold and Silver’s Five Analogies** (金碧五相类)\n**from *Parameter of the Mysterious* (参同契) Volume Middle**\n**Commentary on Yin’s Long Life** (阴长生注)\n\n「Gold and Silver’s Five Analogies (金碧五相类)»\n\n**The Seventh: Gold Essence and Silver Dew (金津玉液)**\nGold Essence arises from the **Kan** (坎) Palace’s **child position** (户),\nSilver Dew is produced from the **Li** (离) Palace’s **noon position** (宫).\nGold Essence is the **vital essence** (精) from the **Kan** Palace’s child position.\nThe **Kan** Palace’s Gold Essence is the **kidney** (肾).\nSilver Dew is the **saliva** (津), born from the **Li** Palace’s noon position.\nThe **Li** Palace is the **heart** (心).\nWhen **vital essence** (精) and **saliva** (津) merge into the **central palace** (中官),\nThey form the **Great Elixir of Gold** (金丹大药), called the **two True Ones of Lead and Mercury** (铅汞二真).\nBoth **essences** (两般) are one in origin,\nYet divided into **Yin and Yang** (二仪) through their **boundaries** (界).\nLead is the **saliva** (津), Mercury is the **vital essence** (精),\nTogether refined through their **boundaries** (界) to completion.\nThus, from the **Li** Palace’s noon position,\nThey are divided into **Yin and Yang** (阴阳), the **transformative principles** (造化) of the **Heavenly Dao** (本一物).\nYet split into **two forms** (二体),\nThey **return and merge** (卸以相合用) to forge the **Great Elixir of Gold** (金丹大药).\nThe **Great Elixir of Gold** (金丹大药) **forms in the East** (大东结).\n\n**When one attains it** (就),\n**The Five Grains grow spontaneously** (五谷自徐),\n**The Three Corpses vanish** (三尸自亡),\nAnd **longevity is secured** (人乃长生延年).\nA **hundred thousand kalpas** (百万劫) as a **Celestial Immortal** (天仙),\nForever beyond the **fall into the mundane** (堕於凡世问).\nYet **those who seek it in vague confusion** (但於恍恍惚惚觅),\nFind **its form in the boundless void** (杳冥自有形).\nIn **vague confusion** (恍恍惚惚),\nThere **is substance within the void** (其中有物),\nCalled **the void containing reality** (虚中有实).\n**Darkness within brilliance** (污中熙) is **boundless void** (杳杳冥冥),\nWhere **vital essence dwells** (其中有精) like **moonlight** (月中).\nThis is the **union of Yang Vital Essence and Yin Saliva** (是阳精与阴津) to form the **Great Elixir** (大药),\nFor **where there is elixir, there is the numinous** (有药自有神).\nThe **numinous** (神) is **breath** (息).\nOne is **water** (水), two is **fire** (火),\nFire **generates earth** (能生土), and earth **nourishes the numinous** (生神).\nThe **void carriage** (空车) **saves on substance** (省实),\nFor **the Dao is born from the void** (无中道自成).\nWithout the **Dao**, **pure Yang cannot forge the elixir** (纯阳不成丹).\nThe **Dao** is **the completion of cultivation and refinement** (修养之成).\n**Blood** (血) four is **water** (水),\n**Blood** (血) one is **fire** (火),\nFire **generates earth** (能生土), and earth **nourishes the numinous** (生神).\nThis is called **one body of Yang Vital Essence** (一体场精),\nAnd **one body of Yin Vital Essence** (一体日阴精).\nThe **Dao’s completion** (道省成) is called **addition** (添),\n**Brilliance transforms into saliva** (熙化为津),\n**Saliva transforms into blood** (津化为血),\nAnd **blood replenishes the vital essence** (血补於精).\nThe **vital essence** (精) is the **numinous** (神),\nThe **numinous** (神) sustains the **body’s vitality** (体印健).\nIf **one nourishes the numinous** (偶存神但养) while **preserving its essence** (存神之理),\nThe **Dao’s completion** (道) is naturally attained.\nYet if **one nourishes brilliance** (养熙) without **preserving the numinous** (不得存神之理),\nThus the **classic says**: Pure Yin, one Yin, one Yang is called the **Dao** (是谓道).\nIts **root lies in the transformative principles** (本因造化体),\nWhere **Yin and Yang shift and flourish** (阴阳变通荣).\n**Brilliance is Yang** (熙者为阳), **vital essence is Yin** (精者为阴),\nTheir **interaction as Yin and Yang** (阴阳相感) is the **correct principle** (为正).\nThe **correct principle** (正界) is the **foundation of human life** (人之根柢).\nWhen **brilliance is scattered** (溅散), the **numinous is lost** (神不东).\nWhen **brilliance is gathered** (聚), the **numinous is purified** (神自清),\nThen **longevity may be attained** (方可得长生).\nThe **numinous and brilliance** (神熙) **are life** (为命),\nThis is the **root of Metal and Wood** (是金木之宗).\nThrough **the transformative principles** (造化),\nThey **shift and flourish** (变通荣).\nWhen **one’s body is joyous** (其身悦),\nTheir **luster naturally thrives** (其泽自得昌盛),\n**Reverting aging to youth** (返老还童),\nThus **this method achieves the true numinous Immortal** (是以此法成真神仙).\n\n**Seven Returns and Nine Circulations** (九还并七返),\n**The Heavenly and Earthly cycles** (乾坤) are their **stages of completion** (是功程).\nThe **Seven Returns** (七返) are from **Yin** (寅) to **Yin** (申),\nThree Yang, three Yin,\nSix **numbers** (数) that **mirror half a year** (可象半年),\nCalled the **True Six** (正六).\nFrom **Yin** (申) to **Yin** (寅) are three Yin, three Yang,\nAlso six **numbers** (数) that **mirror half a year** (可象半),\nNamed the **Seven True** (七正).\nThe **return** (返) is called **intertwining at the spine** (交夹脊),\nAscending to the **brain’s palace** (上至脑户),\nDescending to the **Silver Spring** (却下玉泉).\nThe **Seven Returns and Nine Circulations** (七返九还) are:\nSix Yang, three Yin **numbers** (数) from **Wei** (巳) to **Hai** (亥),\n**Hai** returns to **Wei** (却至巳) in their **process** (行).\nFrom the **tail’s void orifice** (尾闲穴),\nThe **vital essence returns** (返入) to the **Golden Bone** (金骨),\nAnd **ascends through the Central Dao** (中道).\nFrom the **Nest of Mud** (泥丸),\nIt **passes through the Twelve Orifices of the Heavy Palace** (度重楼十二环).\nTo the **Red Sovereign** (赤帝君),\nIt **flows downward to the Elixir Field** (流行下丹田).\nTo the **Yellow Sovereign** (黄元君),\nIt **later enters the Golden Hall** (后入金堂),\nAnd **is stored in the Treasure Vessel** (收入宝鉼藏).\nOne name is **Divine Elixir** (神丹),\nTwo is **Treasure Tortoise** (宝龟),\nThree is **Scarlet Gold Elixir** (赫赤金丹),\nFour is **Threefold True Fire** (三昧真火).\nThese are the **Nine Circulations** (九转),\nManifesting the **Nine-colored lights** (九色之光) of the **Nine Returns** (九还).\n\n**The Eighth: Divine Water and Emerald Green (神水曾青)**\nDivine Water and Emerald Green are **two names** (分两名),\n**Flowing and circulating above and below** (上下通流各别行).\nDivine Water is the **saliva** (津) within the mouth,\nBeneath the tongue,\nOriginating from the **left kidney** (左肾) and **ascending inversely** (而逆上),\nPassing through the **Li** Palace (过离官),\nMostly becoming the **fluid of the Flowering Pool** (华池之浆).\nThus the **song says**: Divine Water, the Flowering Pool’s fluid, the world seeks in vain,\nTransmitted secretly, not to be known by mortals.\nEmerald Green is the **vital essence** (精) born where **the waste is discarded** (弃钥所生),\nFrom the **right kidney** (右肾) it **flows** (而行),\nAscending inversely through the **Li** Palace (离官),\nDescending to emerge at the **Silver Spring** (玉泉).\nThus the **song says**: Emerald Green has a path to the **Rare and Exalted** (希夷),\nIts traces are left only for those of **resolute intent** (志人知).\nFrom **one substance** (一物),\n**Divided into two forms** (分其二形), called **saliva and vital essence** (津精).\nAbove and below, they **flow through separate channels** (别行各道),\nRealizing the **principles of saliva and vital essence** (津精之理),\nOne grasps the **sentiments of Lead and Mercury, Dragon and Tiger** (便是铅汞龙虎之情),\nAnd **attains the void of vague confusion** (达恍惚),\n**Reaching the boundless darkness** (得遂杳冥).\n\nDivine Water **originates from Bing and Ding** (本从丙丁出),\nEmerald Green **is born from Ren and Gui** (生在壬癸情).\n**Bing** (丙) is **Fire’s birth in the South** (南方生於巳), **Yang** (属阳).\n**Ding** (丁) is **Fire’s birth in the South** (南方生於未), **Yin** (属阴).\n**Clasping Li** (夹其离), Li is **two Yang at its ends** (两头是阳),\nAnd **one Yin at its center** (中心是阴).\nThe **Divine Water** (神水) it **produces** (所生) is called:\nOne, **Silver Dew** (玉液),\nTwo, **Lead** (铅),\nThree, **Dragon** (龙),\nFour, **Young Brother** (婴兄),\nFive, **Golden Official** (金公),\nSix, **Taoist Sun Butter** (太阳酥).\nEmerald Green **is born from Ren and Gui** (生在壬癸).\n**Ren** (壬) is **Water’s birth in the North** (北方生於亥), **Yang** (属阳).\n**Gui** (癸) is **Water’s birth in the North** (北方生於丑), **Yin** (属阴).\n**Clasping Kan** (夹其坎), Kan is **two Yin at its ends** (两头是阴),\nAnd **one Yang at its center** (中心是阳).\nThe **Emerald Green** (曾青) it **produces** (所生) is called:\nOne, **Golden Dew** (金液),\nTwo, **Mercury** (汞),\nThree, **Tiger** (虎),\nFour, **Young Sister** (妮女),\nFive, **Jade Essence** (玉质),\nSix, **Dharma Water** (法水).\nThis is the **Heavenly and Earthly transformative principles** (阴阳造化),\nWhere **Ren and Gui mutually transform** (壬癸通变),\nThus **one must recognize them** (故要识也).\n\n**Those who awaken to the Immortal’s principles** (有人自悟仙经理),\n**See the Great Elixir forming** (便见还丹大药成).\n**Even cultivators refining the Dao** (几有修养道人),\n**Who realize the *Parameter of the Mysterious*’s logic** (自悟《参同》之理),\nThe **Great Elixir** (金丹大药) **naturally completes itself** (自然成).\nIn **a moment**, it **transmits its oral instructions** (须臾传之口诀),\nThus the **classic has songs** (故经有歌) saying:\n**\"The Five Phases of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth** (所言金木水火土),\n**Preserve the body, safeguard life as Dragon and Tiger** (留身保命是龙虎).\n**Learners fail to recognize the Five Phases’ vital essences** (学人不认五行精),\n**And forcefully acknowledge others as their parents** (强认他人为父母).\n**Wood governs brilliance** (木主熙), **Metal is the Tiger** (金作虎),\n**Flesh mirrors earth** (肉象土), **blood is water** (血为水).\"\n\nThe **Dao of Immortality** lies in the **Celestial Official** (离官),\nMastering the **true essence of the Five Phases** (五行真有主).\nThe **Great Elixir** must be **mercury-essence pearls** (还丹须是水银珠),\nYet **jade-like purity** (玉质) **cannot be its consort** (那堪为伴倡).\nBut **awakening to this truth** (但悟此言) **reaches the Dao/Way of the Immortal** (达神仙),\nAnd **harmonizes with the High Exalted** (铃与高尊为朋倡).\n\nSeek the **Central Palace’s furnace-vessel** (须向中宫寻鼎器),\nCalculating **Eight Gates’ functions** (八门相应计功程).\nThe **Central Palace’s furnace-vessel** (中官鼎器) **is the Yellow Primordial Lord** (是黄元君也).\nThe **Eight Gates** (八门者) are:\n**Rest, Birth, Injury, Blockage, Eclipse, Death, Shock, and Opening** (休、生、伤、杜、景、死、惊、开).\nCalled **Eight Gates**, they are the **daily applications of the Eight Trigrams** (是日用八卦之应),\nBeginning at **Eight**, dwelling in the Central Palace,\nTo **operate and refine** (使若运用功程下工夫也).\nOnly when **Water and Fire** (水火者) **achieve *Completed Success*** (成既济)—\n**Jing-essence, Vitality, Brilliance, and Breath** (津、精、熙、息是也)—\n**Above is Water, below is Fire** (上有水，下有火),\nThe **Elixir is forged and completed** (其丹炼之而成).\nIf **no miscalculation in breath-counting** (不令差错息数),\nOne may **reach a thousand days as an Immortal** (可至千日为神仙).\nThe **Southern Palace’s register of Immortals** (上方南官列名簿)\nRecords the names of **those who cultivate the Dao** (於修学道人名姓注矣).\n\n---\n**Chapter Nine: Solar Essence and Lunar Luster**\n**Solar Essence** (日精) **and Lunar Luster** (月华),\nWhen **united, refine into cinnabar** (相合炼成砂).\n**Solar Essence** (日精者) **is the brilliance of Wood** (木之熙).\n**Lunar Luster** (月华者) **is the brilliance of Metal** (金之熙).\nWood is **Yang** (木谓之阳), Metal is **Yin** (金谓之阴),\nTheir union **forms the *Cinnabar of Completed Fate*** (相合着方成济命丹砂).\n**Knowing Black to guard Yin** (知白守其阴),\nIs called the **River Vehicle** (名日是河车).\n**Yin is Black** (阴者阴), **Yang is White** (阳以白).\nFrom **Yin emerges Yang**, called **Lead** (从阴而所产阳，谓之铅).\n**Lead** (铅者) **is Black Tin** (阴锡),\nRefined by **Fire**, revealing **White Silver within** (用火而炼之，内有白银自现),\nThus it is said:\n**\"Knowing White to guard Black\"** (知白守阴),\n**Black is Water’s count of One** (阴水数一),\n**White is Metal’s count of Two** (白者金二之数也).\n**One produces Two**, called **Yin and Yang as Solar

produces *Golden Luster*\"* (束方甲乙成金华).\nThis is it.\n\nWithin the **Central Palace**, the **Yellow Sprout** (丹田生黄芽) **emerges**.\nBut **Solar Essence and Lunar Luster** (日精月华),\nUsed **daily in the Four Seasons** (日用四时),\nCirculated into the **Central Palace** (而运转入於中官之内).\nThe **Central Palace** (中官者) **is the furnace-vessel** (谓之鼎器也).\n**Solar Essence** (日精) **is Lead**, named the **River Vehicle** (名日河车).\n**Lunar Luster** (月华) **is Mercury**, named **Golden Luster** (名日金华).\n**Golden Luster** (金华者) **is Lead**, the **Yellow Luster** (黄华也).\nThe **Central Palace’s furnace** (中官鼎者) **is Earth** (谓之曰土也).\nWhen **Lead and Mercury meet Earth** (铅汞见土),\nThe **Sprout is born**, called the **Yellow Sprout** (乃生其芽，谓之日黄芽是也).\nWhen **the Five Grains’ impurities are exhausted**

Ten: Great and Small Counts**\nFrom **One to Ten** (从一至十),\nAllocated by **years and months** (分配年月).\n\nFrom **One to a hundred**, from **a hundred to a thousand**, from **a thousand to ten thousand**,\nTen thousand generates **ten thousand** (亿),\nTen thousand thousand becomes **a hundred million** (兆),\nA hundred million turns to **a myriad myriad** (垓),\nThis is the **Great and Small Counts** (增之大小数).\n\nThe **Small Count** (小者) is **twelve hours in a day** (一日十二时),\nSix hours as **yang** (阳), from **Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳);\nSix hours as **yin** (阴), from **Wu** (午) to **Hai** (亥),\nA day and a night, this is called the **Zi-Wu Method** (子午法).\n\n**Zi** (子) before is **nurturing yin** (生阴),\n**Wu** (午) after is **killing yang** (死阳),\nNot to be practiced.\n\nFrom **Zi** (子) after to **Wu** (午) before,\nThis is called **nurturing yang** (生阳),\nWhere one may apply effort.\n\nThus the verse says:\n*\"From **Zi** after to **Wu** before, one must strive with intent to refine,\nExit and enter as one’s will dictates,\n**Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳) must be pondered carefully—this is the treasure.\"*\n\nFrom **Zi** after to **Wu** before,\nThis is the **refinement of Jade Fluid and Golden Essence** (运用玉液金精) to produce **Immortal Elixir** (仙药),\nThe **count of yang predominance and yin receding** (阳大阴小之数).\n\nAt **Yin** (寅) and **You** (酉) open the furnace and bathe,\n**Three *cǐ* (参) and two *liǎng* (两) divided evenly**—**stop.\n\nFor **ninety-nine times** (九九) at **Yin** (寅) and **You** (酉),\nAnd **twenty-eight days** (二八日),\nOne must not practice nor dwell in the fire,\nOnly use them for bathing.\n\nAt **Yin** (寅), **Shen** (申), **Si** (巳), and **Hai** (亥) kindle the fire.\nEach hour use **one *cǐ* of fire** (一铢),\n**Three *cǐ* and seven *hū* (忽)**—**seven *sī* (丝) and seven *miǎo* (杪),\nDo not let the fire be hasty,\nIt must be **gradually added** (慢慢加火之数).\n\nFire (火者) **is the method of closing breath to nurture the void** (闭息养无),\nA practice within the **Dao of the spirit** (在神之数).\n\nFrom **nine** (九), **gradually increase** (而添),\nUntil reaching **ten thousand** (至万数),\nThe **Golden Elixir** (金丹) will naturally be forged,\nWhen its **baby form** (婴儿) is seen,\nThis is called **\"Ten-Month Pregnancy of Mother and Child\"** (十月怀胎子母分),\nThe **Elixir’s completion** (丹之成).\n\nWrap **silver** (银) around **gold** (金) to form the **outer casing** (裹),\nMerge the **spirit’s chamber** (神室) with the **embryonic form** (子形).\n\nSilver (银表者) **is lead** (铅),\nGold (金裹者) **is mercury** (汞).\nLead (铅) is **yang** (阳),\nMercury (汞) is **yin** (阴).\nYang (阳) is the **outer casing** (表),\nYin (阴) is the **inner core** (裹).\n\n**Dragon’s retreat and Tiger’s concealment** (龙伏虎),\nFluid wrapped, Essence contained,\nThis is called **Day Soul and Moon Spirit** (日魂月魄),\n**Day Essence and Moon Radiance** (日精月华),\n**Yin Brother and Yang Sister** (婴兄诧女),\n**Jade Night and Golden Fluid** (玉夜金津),\nHence the saying: **\"Six yang lines, six yin lines\"** (六阳爻六阴爻).\n\nTheir mutual regulation is called the **spirit’s chamber** (神室),\nYin and yang **vigorously unite** (熙相结),\nLike the **cock’s crow at dawn** (鸡卯),\nThis is called the **embryonic form of yellow and white** (合子形黄白).\n\nPlace it in the **Central Palace’s cauldron** (中宫鼎),\nThen use the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) to proceed.\nThe **Central Palace** (中官) is the **Dan Tian** (丹田),\nCalled the **cauldron vessel** (鼎器).\n\nYin and yang **vigor** (二熙),\nRefined and drawn into the **Central Palace** (中官),\nObtaining **earth** (土) allows them to merge and regulate as one.\n\n**Green, yellow, and white** (青黄白) are its **Elixir** (丹),\nCalled the **mandate** (命).\n\nThe **trigram patterns** (卦体者) are **stages of practice** (功程之侯),\nAlso the **yin and yang weights and trigrams’ lines** (阴阳斤两、卦象爻数),\nThe **union of yin and yang essences** (阴精阳精合成).\n\nDiscourse on the **Trigram Patterns** (卦体章第十):\n**Qian generates Kan** (乾生於坎) is **Golden Essence** (金精).\n**Qian** (乾) is **Heaven** (天), belonging to **Metal** (金), corresponding to **West-North** (位应西北).\nOn the **fifteenth day** (十五日), **returning light faces *Gēng* (庚) at *Shēn* (申)**—**\nOne **water** (水) unites with **Green Vigor** (青熙).\n\n**Kan produces *Gèn* (艮)**—**the **name of mountains and stones** (山石名).\n**Kan generates water** (坎生水),\nThis is **yin containing yang** (阴中有阳),\nFrom **Metal** (金) generating **Kan** (坎).\nOn the **fifteenth day** (十五日),\n**Yin-Month’s White Essence** (阴月白精) and **water** (水) are produced in **Kan** (坎),\nThe **trigram named Mountain-Stone** (卦名山石).\n\nBound in the **North position** (在位束北),\nThis is called **Day Essence** (日生).\nOn the **twenty-eighth day** (二十八日),\nThe **lowering *xián* (弦) form**—**Wood** (木),\n**Water-Mountain-Stone** (水山石) produces **Zhèn** (震) **— Wood** (木).\nThe **trigram named Thunder** (卦名雷),\nCorresponding to the **Mao position** (应之卯位),\nComprising **a hundred *kè* (刻), twenty *fēn* (分), and forty *miǎo* (杪)**,\nAlso **seventy-two degrees** (七十二度),\nSymbolizing **one year’s ten-month count** (象一年十月之数).\nHence, it is called **\"Ten Years\"** (十年),\nThus it is called the **Small Count** (故谓之小也).\n\nThe **Great Count** (大者) is **twelve months** (十二月).\nSix months as **yang** (阳): **eleventh to fourth month** (十一月至四月),\nFrom **Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳).\nSix months as **yin** (阴): **fifth to tenth month** (五月至十月),\nFrom **Wu** (午) to **Hai** (亥).\nThis is the **count of twelve months in a year** (一年十二个月之数),\nThus it is called the **Great Count** (故谓之大也).\nThis is the **stage of the year’s monthly count** (此是一年之月数之程),\nThe **true monthly count** (是实数月).\n\n**Day and hour counts** (日时运) are **numbers** (为数),\nBut they measure **yin and yang conditions** (但度阴阳情).\n**Day** (日者) is **aligned with hour** (与时同光).\n\nFor those who **practice and refine life and mandate** (几修学养性炼命),\nOne may use the **Four Seasons** (四时).\nThe **Four Seasons** (四时), the **Four *Mèng* (孟)**—**\n**Establishing Spring** (立春), **Establishing Summer** (立夏), **Establishing Autumn** (立秋), **Establishing Winter** (立冬),\nCalled the **Four *Mèng* (孟)**—**\n**First month’s *Mèng* Spring** (正月孟春), **Fourth month’s *Mèng* Summer** (四月孟夏), **Seventh month’s *Mèng* Autumn** (七月孟秋),\nAnd **Tenth month’s *Mèng* Winter** (十月孟冬), as recorded in *Sān Tóng Qì* (参同契).\n\nThese are the **beginnings of the four seasons** (此为四季之首).\n**Hours** (时) use **Yin** (寅), **Shen** (申), **Si** (巳), and **Hai** (亥),\nThis is called **\"Day’s Seven Returns and Nine Reversions\"** (日七返九还).\n**Yin** (寅) is **Wood** (木),\n**Si** (巳) is **Fire** (火),\n**Shen** (申) is **Metal** (金),\n**Hai** (亥) is **Water** (水),\nThese are the **four images** (四象) contained in the **Central Palace** (纳於中官),\nForming the **Five Phases** (为之五行),\nThus it is called **\"Nine Reversions\"** (故谓日九还).\n\n**Yin** (寅) as **Metal** (金),\n**Si** (巳) as **Water** (水),\n**Shen** (申) as **Wood** (木),\n**Hai** (亥) as **Fire** (火),\nContained in the **Central Palace** (纳於中官),\n**Reversed and paired with *Kàn* (坎) and *Lí* (离)**,\nThus it is called **\"Seven Returns\"** (故日七返).\n\nHence the scripture says:\n*\"The **Lí Palace** (离官) holds the **true water** (真水) within its symbol,\nThe **Kàn door** (坎户) contains the **hidden true metal** (隐正金).\"*\n\nThis is called **\"Seven Returns and Nine Reversions\"** (故谓之九还七返),\nThe **yin and yang conditions** (是阴阳之情).\n\nFor those who **practice and attain this principle** (几修养悟此理),\nThis is the **true, unobstructed wondrous Dao** (是真正妙道无碍).\n\n**Six Harmonies and the Breaking of Oppositions** (六合与冲破),\nSpiritual mechanisms **mutually wrapped** (互包) to form.\n\n**Zi-Chou** (子丑), **Yin-Hai** (寅亥), **Si-Shen** (巳申), **Wu-Wei** (午未), **Xū-Mao** (戌卯), **You-Chen** (酉辰),\nThese are the **Six Harmonies** (六合).\n\n**Zi-Wu** (子午), **Mao-You** (卯酉), **Si-Hai** (巳亥), **Yin-Shen** (寅申), **Chen-Xū** (辰戌),\nThese are the **Breaking of Oppositions** (冲破).\n\nWhen the **Six Harmonies** (六合) all **turn and transform** (运转),\nThe **Breaking of Oppositions** (冲破) is used for practice,\nThis is the **spiritual mechanisms mutually wrapped** (神机互包成象).\n\nThe **Great Count** (大) and **Small Count** (小) are **yin and yang principles** (阴阳情理),\nBut depend on this **refinement without deviation** (但依此铃无差互).\n\nThe **Great Count** (大) requires **nine years of practice** (九载),\nThe **Small Count** (小) is **a hundred days** (百日).\n\nThis sentence is explained by the previous one.\nThe **Great Count** (大) is **nine years, twenty-seven months** (九年二十七),\nThe **Small Count** (小) is **three months** (方三月) **—** the **Great Count’s completion** (大功毕).\n\nThe **Small Count** (小) is the **one-hundred-day closed-breath practice** (百日闭息功程),\nWhere one may immediately achieve **Golden Elixir** (金丹),\nExceeding the **nine-year Great Count** (九载之功).\n\nThis is called **\"Nine Years, One Hundred Days\"** (此谓九载，百日之名数).\n**Nine years** (九载) is difficult to achieve,\nBut **one hundred days** (百日) can be completed immediately.\n\n**Yin** (寅) and **Shen** (申) together with **Si** (巳) and **Hai** (亥),\n**Zi-Wu** (子午) **refines Golden Essence** (转金精).\n\n**Yin** (寅), **Shen** (申), **Si** (巳), and **Hai** (亥),\nThese are called the **Four Seasons** (四时).\n**Practice with the Day’s Zi-Wu** (日用功行子午名),\n**Reversed *Bàn* (般) *Zǐ* (载) from the *Wěi* (尾) *Xiàn* (闲) hole,\n**Returning upward to *Ní* (泥) *Jiǔ* (九)**—**\n**Sequentially turning to return to the Dan Tian** (顺转归於丹田中),\n**Revealing true nature** (见真性),\n**Gold crystals transform into Golden Elixir** (金晶变转成金丹).\n\n「The **Yīn** (令) **Sheng** (生) phase—**two-day** (二日) **xiàng** (象)—\nIs the **grandson of Gold** (金之孙) and the **child of Water** (水之子).\nEmerging from **Shān** (山), it is called **two yīn, one yáng** (二阴一阳).\nWhen the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other and generate,\nIt becomes the **body of Wind** (风体), **Wood** (木), the **Spring Vitality** (春中日魂).\nIt is also called the **Dragon of the Sun and Moon** (日月精名日龙),\nThe **ninefold number** (《周易》九之数) of the *Chóng* (弦) and *Wàng* (望).\n\n**Xùn** (巽) is **Wind** (风),\nGenerating the **body of Wood** (体木) and forming the trigrams.\nAs **Xùn** (巽), its name is the **Wind Trigram** (卦名日风),\nAnd its position corresponds to **束** (束) **Nán** (南) [the southeast].\nThus, the **daughter of Kǎn** (坎) [Water] generates within **Wood** (木).\nIn **Spring** (春), it can generate,\nAs all things sprout and bud,\nAnd the **gentle wind** (和风) melts the frost—\nThis is called **two yáng, one yīn** (二阳一阴).\nWith **yáng** above and **yīn** below,\nIn **three days** (三日) it becomes **perfected** (成华).\n\n**Lí** (离) is the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀) hidden in **Earth** (土).\n**Lí** (离) belongs to **Fire** (火),\nCalled **yīn within yáng** (阳中阴),\nGenerated from **Zhèn** (震) [Thunder],\nFormed by **Wind** (风) into its trigram structure.\nIt is said that **cinnabar** (朱砂) contains **quicksilver** (水银),\nPositioned at **Wǔ** (午) [south],\nBelonging to **yīn** (阴).\nHidden in **Earth** (土) #3—\nThis means there is the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram in the **southwest** (西南),\nAnd in **sixty days** (六十日) it forms **purple essence** (紫精),\nWhere **yīn** and **yáng** are beyond measure.\n\n**Duì** (兑) emerges from the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] palace,\nNaturally harmonizing with **emotion** (情).\n**Duì** (兑) corresponds to the **west** (西方) at **yǒu** (酉) [west],\nGenerated from **Kūn** (坤) [Earth],\nAnd its season aligns with the **eighth month** (八月).\nWhen the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other,\nThe **moon** (月) grows—\nAfter **four and seven** (四七) [the 14th day],\nIt begins to wane, becoming **two yīn, one yáng** (二阴一阳).\nWith **yīn** above and **yáng** below,\nIn **ninety days** (九十日) it forms **purple gold sand** (紫金砂).\n**Gold sand** (金砂) is **purple crystal** (紫晶),\nWhich is also called **essence** (精).\n\nAfter **Zǐ** (子) [north], the **Fù** (复) line becomes the **initial trigram** (初卦),\nAnd **Yīn** (寅) **Shēn** (申) [west] **Tài** (泰) [Peace] **sevenfold return** (七返灵).\n**Zǐ** (子) corresponds to the **eleventh month** (十一月),\nAnd the **sun** (日) aligns with **Zǐ** (子) [midnight],\nWhere **one yáng** (一阳) initially generates,\nOperating beneath **five yīn** (五阴) in its **functioning** (功程),\nCalled the **Earth-Thunder *Fù* Trigram** (地雷《复》卦).\n**Five yīn** (五阴) battle **one yáng** (一阳),\nKnown as **\"Dragon in the Field\"** (见龙在田).\nReturning to **Yīn** (寅) [east], it becomes the **Earth-Heaven *Tài* Trigram** (地天《泰》卦),\nCalled **\"Mutual Prosperity of Three Yīn, Three Yáng\"** (交泰三阴三阳).\nReturning again to **Shēn** (申) [west], it becomes the **Heaven-Earth *Pǐ* Trigram** (天地《否》卦),\nAlso **\"Mutual Prosperity\"** (交泰),\nCorresponding to **autumn’s three yáng, three yīn** (秋三阳三阴),\nKnown as **sevenfold return** (七返),\nExplaining the **returning interplay** (相返) of the *Pǐ* (否) and *Tài* (泰) trigrams.\n\nAfter **Wǔ** (午) [south], the **Gòu** (遘) position arrives in correspondence,\nAnd **Sì** (巳) **Hài** (亥) [west] **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] **ninefold return** (九还成).\n**Wǔ** (午) corresponds to the **fifth month** (五月),\nAnd the **sun** (日) aligns with **Wǔ** (午) [noon],\nWhere **one yīn** (一阴) initially generates,\nAfter the **five yáng** (五阳) have completed their **functioning** (功程),\nCalled the **Heaven-Wind *Gòu* Trigram** (天风《遘》).\n**Five yáng** (五阳) battle **one yīn** (一阴),\nKnown as **\"Six in the First Position: Treading Dew, Firm Ice Approaches\"** (初六履霜坚冰至).\n\n**Sì** (巳) corresponds to the **fourth month** (四月),\nAnd the **sun** (日) aligns with **Sì** (巳) [morning],\nCalled the **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] trigram’s **structure** (体),\nWith **six yáng** (六阳) lines fully present,\n**Yáng** (阳) heavy at **one hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢) [12.6 grams].\n\n**Hài** (亥) corresponds to the **tenth month** (十月),\nAnd the **sun** (日) aligns with **Hài** (亥) [night],\nCalled the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram’s **structure** (体),\nWith **six yīn** (六阴) lines fully present #4,\n**Yīn** (阴) heavy at **one hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢) [12.6 grams].\n\n**Yáng** (阳) is **silver** (银) at **half a jīn** (半斤) [8 oz],\nAnd **yīn** (阴) is **gold** (金) at **half a jīn** (半斤) [8 oz].\nWhen **gold** (金) and **silver** (银) combine,\nTheir total weight is **three hundred eighty-four zhu** (铢),\nCalled **sixteen liǎng** (两) [16 oz],\nWhich is **one jīn** (一斤) [1 lb] in measure.\nThis is the **Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir** (金丹大药),\nThe **ninefold return of the Golden Elixir** (九转还丹之名).\nThe **ninefold return** (日九还) corresponds to **nine colors** (九色).\nWhen the **nine colors** (九色) appear,\n**Chóng** (弦) and **Wàng** (望) naturally complete their formation.\n\n**Gèn** (艮) [Mountain] invests the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram,\n**Yáng** (阳) [Heaven] fully observed,\nEmploying the **yīn-yáng nine-month process** (运用阴阳九月程).\n**Gèn** (艮) is **Mountain** (山),\nPositioned at **束** (束) **Běi** (北) [northeast],\nWith **one yáng, two yīn** (一阳二阴).\n**Kūn** (坤) is **Earth** (地),\nPositioned at **xīnán** (西南) [southwest],\nWith **three yīn** (三阴).\n\nWhen **Gèn** (艮) [Mountain] invests **Kūn** (坤) [Earth],\nThe trigram is named **Mountain-Earth *Bō* Trigram** (山地《剥》),\nCorresponding to the **ninth month** (九月),\nWhere **one yáng** (一阳) battles **five yīn** (五阴).\nBy the **tenth month** (十月), **Hài** (亥) [west] is established,\n**Yīn** (阴) is exhausted, **yáng** (阳) is spent,\nAnd the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram is revealed.\n**Kūn** (坤) is where **true Earth** (真土) and its **wondrous applications** (妙用) are seen—\nThis is called **\"Earth of the Sun\"** (日土).\n\n**Duì** (兑) enters the **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] palace,\n**Yīn** (阴) nearly vanishing,\nThe trigram divides at the **seasonal nodes** (节令),\nAnd the **ninth month’s threefold process** (九三经) is complete.\n**Duì** (兑) corresponds to the **west** (正西) at **yǒu** (酉) [west],\nAnd **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] corresponds to the **northwest** (西北) position.\nThe **Duì** (兑) trigram is named **Marsh** (泽),\nAnd the **Qián** (乾) trigram is named **Heaven** (天).\n**Duì** (兑) and **Qián** (乾) are both **metal** (金).\n**One yīn** (一阴) battles **five yáng** (五阳),\nCorresponding to the **third month** (三月),\nCalled the **Marsh-Heaven *Yāng* Trigram** (泽天《央》),\nWhere **yīn** (阴) nearly vanishes.\nBy the **fourth month** (四月), **Sì** (巳) [east] is established,\nAnd the **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] trigram is perfected.\nThis is called the **ninefold return** (九还).\n\nThus, the **Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir** (金丹大药) becomes a **treasure** (成宝),\nKnown as **purple gold sand** (号名紫金砂).\n\n**Chóng** (弦) **Wàng** (望) **Chapter Twelve** (章第十二):\n**Upper Chóng** (上弦) begins at the **new moon** (月初生) at **gēng** (庚) [west].\nEvery **three days** (几三日),\nThe **moon** (月) emerges from **gēng** (庚) [west],\nCalled **gold essence** (金精),\n**Familiarity** (熙) initially generates,\n**Yīn** (阴) lines emerge,\nWeighing **twelve zhu** (铢),\nNamed **moon’s shadow** (月魄).\n\n**Lower Wàng** (下弦) is the **moon’s decline** (月丧) at **jiǎ** (甲) [east].\nEvery **twenty-eighth day** (二十八日) of the **moon** (阳),\nThe **moon’s decline** (月丧) is revealed.\n**Jiǎ** (甲) [east] is where **familiarity** (熙) initially generates,\n**Yáng** (阳) lines emerge,\nAnd **familiarity** (熙) harmonizes with it—**yáng** (阳).\n**Silver** (银) is the **outer layer** (表),\nThe **envelope** (裹),\nWith **water and fire** (水火) at **eight liǎng** (八两) [64 grams],\nWhen the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other at **seven and eight** (七八) [times],\n**Familiarity** (熙) is generated.\n\nThe **first fifteen days** (前十五日) and **last fifteen days** (后十五日),\nFive days total—\n**One hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢),\nThe **moon’s decline** (月丧) is at **jiǎ** (甲) [east],\nEarly **too heavy** (太重) #5—\n**Twelve zhu** (铢) is named **sun’s vitality** (日魂) #6 #7.\n\n**Harmonization** (合) of **yīn-yáng** (阴阳) **familiarity** (熙) totals **one liǎng** (一两) [16 grams],\nCalled the **measure of yīn-yáng** (阴阳之数).\nThis is **lead** (铅) generated from **Wood** (木) as **husband** (夫).\nAnd **quicksilver** (汞) generated from **Metal** (金) as **wife** (妇).\nWhen combined, they form the **four essences** (四象),\nTotaling **sixteen liǎng** (十六两) [128 grams] of **Great Medicine** (大药).\n\nWhen the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other at **seven and eight** (七八) [times],\nThe **sixteen yīn-yáng** (二八阴阳) lines are complete.\nThe **sun and moon** (日月) each reach **fifteen days** (十五日) in **illumination** (一望),\nThe **moon** (月) has **abundance** (盈)—\nThis is **two moons** (二月).\nThe **last fifteen days** (后十五日) are the **moon’s decline** (月).\nIt is said that **six yīn, six yáng** (六阴六阳) are fully present,\n**Yáng** (阳) heavy at **one hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢),\nTotaling **three hundred eighty-four zhu** (铢),\nThe **moon** (月) at **sixteen liǎng** (一十六两) [128 grams],\n**Chóng** (弦) **silver** (银) at **eight liǎng** (八两) [64 grams],\n**Moon’s decline** (月) at **eight liǎng** (八) [64 grams],\nOpposing **twenty-three days** (对二十三) **moon’s decline** (月) at **eight liǎng** (八与二十三),\nAnd **fourth month’s jī** (四j') **Wood** (木) also.\n**Wood essence** (木精),\n**Yīn-yáng sun-moon** (阴阳日月) totaling **twenty-four zhu** (相计二十四铢),\nThe **sun** (日) has **abundance** (盈) **Wood** (木) for **measure** (为);\nAnd **Metal** (金) is **reversed** (日有反).\nThe **first ten days** (前十) are **silver’s outer layer** (银表) and **gold’s envelope** (金裹).\n**Gold and water** (金水) at **eight liǎng** (八两) [64 grams],\nWhen the **sun and moon** (日月) meet,\nThe **moon** (月) has **deficiency** (亏),\nAgain **yīn** (阴) is heavy at **one** (一),\nCalculating **one jīn** (一斤) [1 lb] in total.\n\nThe moon in its **ascending phase** (上弦) produces **eight liǎng** (八两) of **Metal** (金), its rising and setting both within the **Lí** (离) mansion.\nWhen the moon rises and sets, it is said to be aligned together at the **true south** (正南) at **noon** (午地), belonging to **Fire** (火), corresponding to the **Lí** (离) hexagram—where the two ends are **yáng** (阳), and the center is **yīn** (阴).\nAccording to the *Zhōu Shū* (《周书》), it states: **\"Lí’s center is void\"** (#8).\nThis means **Fire** (火) contains **Water** (水), and every **eighth and twenty-third day** of the month, it is generated in the **Lí** mansion.\nThe **moon** is the **Metal’s radiance** (金之熙), and within **Lí** lies **true Water** (真水), which is the **child-mother** (子母) of **Metal** (金), hence its appearance and disappearance in the **Lí** mansion.\n\nThe **yīn-yáng** distribution of **Metal** (金) and **silver** (银) aligns with the **great elixir’s** (大药) harmonious correspondence.\n**Yīn** refers to **Metal** (金),\n**Yáng** refers to **silver** (银).\nThe **moon** is **Metal** (金), the **sun** is **silver** (银)—when **sun and moon** (日月) align, **silver** is the **outer layer** (表), **Metal** is the **envelope** (裹), and **mercury** (汞) with **lead** (铅) naturally coalesces into the **great elixir** (大药).\nBut one must **nurture the spirit** (存神) and **restrain the refining** (息炼) of the **golden elixir** (金丹).\n**Nurturing the spirit** (存神) is the **radiance** (熙),\n**Restraining** (息) is the **blood** (血).\n**Black** is **Water** (水), **blood** is **Water** (水).\n**Restraining** (息) has five aspects: as **Earth** (土), as **Metal** (金), as **Water** (水), as **Wood** (木), as **Fire** (火).\n**Water** is **blood** (血), **blood** is **marrow** (髓), **marrow** is **essence** (精), and **essence** is then the **spirit** (神).\nIf one preserves **essence** (精), it becomes **jin** (津).\nWhen **jin** (津) and **essence** (精) harmonize, life is sustained, years prolonged, and longevity increased.\nThe **Dan Tian** (丹田) contains **true radiance** (真熙), and soon one becomes a **true person** (真人).\n\nAfter **nine transformations** (九转), the heavens and earth are renewed, and the **three worms** (三虫) are extinguished, granting **prosperity** (昌) to the body.\n**Nine transformations** (九转) refer to the union of **essence** (精) and **jin** (津), where **lead** (铅) and **mercury** (汞) self-form.\n**Lead** (铅) is **white externally, black internally**,\n**Mercury** (汞) is **red externally, white within**.\nWhen refined into **true lead** (真铅), the **red** turns **pale yellow** (徘),\n**Lead** (铅) transforms into **yellow** (黄),\n**Yellow lead** (黄铅) merges with **pale yellow, red, and green** to become **purple gold** (紫金), named **golden sand** (金砂).\nThis is the **great elixir’s** (大药) circulation within the **central mansion** (中官),\n**Nine unifications into one** (九合归一), known as the **golden elixir** (金丹).\nAfter abstaining from **five grains** (五谷), within a hundred days, the **three worms** (三虫) self-destruct,\nGranting **bodily prosperity** (身昌) and **transcendent form** (形超),\n**Golden bones** (金骨) and **luminous body** (体透光明),\n**Silken hair** (绪发) and **youthful visage** (童颜),\nEqual to the **immortals** (仙), naturally free from **cold, heat, or hunger**.\n\nThe **Three Pure Ones** (三清) bestow celestial decrees.\nIf one recognizes **lead** (铅) and **mercury** (汞),\nWarmly refining them into the **golden elixir** (金丹),\nAnd anchoring it within the **Three Officials** (三官),\nUsing the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) daily,\nWith **six-time circulation** (六时运转),\nThe **Heavenly Gate** (天关) does not open inward,\nThe **Earthly Gate** (地户) does not emit outward—\nThis is the **leak-proof field** (无漏之田).\nWhen the **merit is complete** (功成) and the **practice fulfilled** (行满),\nOne’s name is recorded in the **Three Pure Ones’** (三清) celestial register.\nAfter **eight hundred days** (八百), treasures spread across **three thousand** (三千),\nHeavenly messengers in **scarlet robes** (朱衣) descend to welcome.\n---\n*Annotations from the original

Refining** (七返) name,\nand arise from the **True Essence** within the **Dan Field** (丹田之中真**精**所生).\n\n**Jia** is Wood, **Geng** is Metal—Metal and Wood mutually assail.\nFrom **Yin to Shen** (寅至申) as **Geng**, measuring **Jia’s** return to bind and form the **Refinement**.\n**Yin** is the **Jia’s** progenitor, **Shen** the **Geng’s** ancestor.\n**Jia** is called **Day Essence** (日精), the **Essence of Wood** (木之**精**).\n**Geng** is called **Moon Dew** (月华), the **Essence of Metal** (金之**精**).\nMetal and Wood mutually assail—\nInitially as **Divine Symbols of White Snow** (神符白雪),\nwhen **Essence and Qi** (精津) merge,\nwithin the **Crucible** like mother-of-pearl,\nor like snow and ice—\ncalled **Day Divine Symbols of White Snow Golden Elixir Great Return Elixir** (日神符白雪金液大还丹).\nThis is the **Supreme Refined Elixir of Spirit** (上品灵妙之丹).\n\n**Bing-Ren** (丙壬) converge to form **Two Essences** (二**精**).\n**Bing** is Fire, **Ren** is Water.\n**Bing** belongs to the Heart, called **Li** (离).\n**Ren** belongs to the Kidneys, called **Kan** (坎).\nFire and Water counteracting form **Completed** (既济).\n**Kan** is Lead, **Li** is Mercury.\nMercury within **Kan-Lead** refines into **White Silver** (白银),\n**Li-Mercury** returns to form **Red Boy** (朱儿).\nThe **Red Brother** and **White Lead** merge,\nwhen burned, become **Two Essences’ Red Cinnabar Elixir** (二**精**赤丹砂).\n\nWithin **Jia**, **Horse-Tooth** (马牙) appears like **Laughing Birth** (似笑生).\nTaking the **Two Essences’ Cinnabar Elixir** into the **Dan Field** to warm-refine,\nit transforms into **White Horse-Tooth** (白马牙).\nLike the tender sprout of **Luo** (劳),\nor white shoots sprouting from grass,\nrising from the earth—\ncalled **White Horse-Tooth** (白马牙).\n\nMetal and Wood reunite in the **Crucible**,\nWater and Fire harmonize in the **Hero’s Pit** (雄坑).\nMetal is Water, is Mercury—**Yin**.\nWood is Fire, is Lead—**Yang**.\nMetal is **Essence** (精),\nWood is **Qi** (津).\nThe **Four Symbols** harmonized,\nentered into the **Central Official** (中官)—\ncalled the **Crucible** (鼎).\n**Stillness and Closure of Essence** (定息闭**精**),\n**Nurturing Spirit** within the **Central Crucible** (存神於中官鼎内).\nThe **Crucible** is Earth—\ncalled the **Hero’s Pit** (雄坑).\nIts medicine is named **Four Spirits** (四神),\nalso called **Four-Refining Soul Elixir** (四转灵丹).\n\nWhen the **Five Phases** merge and transform,\n**Jade Elixir and Cinnabar** refine through **Seven Turns**.\nThe **Five Phases** are Water, Wood, Fire, Metal, Earth.\nIts medicine transforms into **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽),\nthen into **Jade Elixir and Cinnabar** (玉液丹砂)—\n**Seventy-Two Days** equal **Seventy-Two Years** in duration.\n\n**Yin-Shen** (寅申) focus intent on **Fire’s Timing** (火候),\nbut preserve **White Essence** to return **Metal Essence** (金精).\n**Yin** is Wood, **Shen** is Metal.\nWood is **Yang**—Lead and Mercury merge.\nAt **Yin Hour** and **Shen Hour**,\n**Si Hour** and **Hai Hour**, apply the **Work**—\ncalled **Destruction-Refinement, Diligent Fire Timing** (毁炼勤行火候),\n**Nurturing Metal Essence** to extend years and life.\n\n**Day-Month, Four Seasons, and Eight Trigrams**—\nthe **Great Elixir** transforms into **Childhood**.\n**Day Use**: One day equals one year.\n**Month Use**: The Four Seasons—**Yin, Shen, Si, Hai**.\n**Yin** is **Early Spring** (孟春), **Hai** is **Early Winter** (孟冬),\n**Shen** is **Early Autumn** (孟秋), **Si** is **Early Summer** (孟夏)—\nthese are the Four Seasons, mirroring a year’s count.\nThe **Eight Trigrams** are:\n*Kàn* (乾), *Kūn* (坤), *Lí* (离), *Kàn* (坎), *Pǐ* (否), *Tài* (泰), *Fù* (复), *Gòu* (遘).\nThis is the **Application of the Eight Trigrams**.\n\n**One Hundred Twenty Days** complete the **Great Elixir’s** count—\n**One Thousand Two Hundred Years**, the **Three Worms** die,\n**Grain Essence** (谷**精**) exhausted,\nthe **Five Viscera’s True Essence** self-formed—\nforever abandoning tastes,\nneither drinking nor thirsting,\nreturning to childhood, body light and ears keen,\nmoving like flying—\nwalking as clouds race, rain rushes—\nstrength doubled, becoming **Immortal**.\n\n**Chapter on Nine Refining** (九转章第十四)\nThe **Nine-Refining Soul Elixir** is called **Gold** (金).\nThe **Daoist Classic’s** profound meaning is deep.\nTo recognize the **True Great Medicine** within the body,\none must rely on **Yin-Yang Two Essences** (阴阳二**精**) to complete it.\nCalled **Purple-Gold Cinnabar** (紫金丹砂),\nthough **Daoist Scriptures** number ten thousand volumes,\nand **Master’s Writings** ten thousand chapters,\nall speak of **Lead and Mercury**.\nStudents who do not grasp the principles\ninstead take **Essence and Tin**, **Water Silver** (水银),\nand burn them in **Crucibles**—\nyet none attain it.\n\nThose who awaken to its principles know:\nthe **Great Medicine** never leaves the body—\nthe body itself contains it.\nThis is the **Purple-Gold Elixir** (紫金丹).\nIf one grain is refined,\nit extends life for **Ten Thousand Years**—\nghosts and spirits fear it.\n\nFew students awaken to **Lead and Mercury’s** principles,\nrecognizing **Yin-Yang’s** roots,\ndestroying and refining into **Elixir** to extend years,\nadding **Ten Thousand**—all diseases vanish,\nthe **Three Worms** annihilated,\nspirits and demons tremble upon seeing it.\n\nDispersed as **Thousands of Flowing Pearls** (流珠),\nwhen gathered, they become **True Person** (真人).\nWhen **Lead and Mercury** are refined into **Pearls** (珠),\nalso called **Relics** (舍利), **Immortal’s Flowing Pearls** (仙人日流珠).\nThis is the **Seven Treasures** gathered—\n**Yin-Yang Two Essences** merging into **One Grain**,\n**True Gold** the size of a **Square Inch** (方寸),\nweighing **One Catty** (一斤), **Sixteen Two-Ounces** (十六两).\n**Yin** weighs **One Hundred Ninety-Two Mín** (一百九十二铢),\n**Yang** weighs **One Hundred Ninety-Two Mín**—\nthis is **Metal and Wood**.\nWood is **Mercury**, Metal is **Lead**.\nMercury is the **Tiger**, Lead is the **Dragon**.\nThe **Dragon and Tiger** subdue each other,\nself-forming the **True Medicine of Immortal**.\n\n**Yin-Yang Lines** harmoniously converge,\nthe **Mechanism of Creation** naturally unites.\n**Yin** is the **Kūn Trigram** (坤卦), **Yang** is the **Kàn Trigram** (乾卦).\n**Kūn** is Earth, **Kàn** is Heaven.\n**Heavenly Essence** descends, **Earthly Essence** ascends.\nThrough **Yin-Yang** mutual sensation and harmony,\ncalled **Creation** (造化)—\nnamed **Divine Communication** (神通),\nalso called **Unfathomable Creation Divine Communication** (造化神通难测量).\n\n**Chapter on Eliminating the Three Worms** (除三虫章第#3十五)\nThe **Three Worms** later have names.\nThe **Three Worms** are the **Three Corpses** (三尸).\nThe **Upper Worm**, surname **Peng**, named **Jū** (居),\ndwells in the **Upper Dan Field** (上丹田).\nThe **Middle Worm**, surname **Peng**, named **Zhì** (质),\ndwells in the **Middle Dan Field** (中丹田).\nThe **Lower Worm**, surname **Peng**, named **Jiǎo** (矫),\ndwells in the **Lower Dan Field** (下丹田).\nWithin the body, they are the **Three Souls** (三魂),\nalso called the **Three Corpses**.\nThey crave **alcohol, meat, and fighting**,\n**greed for wealth and lust**—\ncausing early death in humans.\n\n**Chapter on Eliminating the Three Worms (续)**\nThe **Upper Corpse** delights in food, wine, meat, joy, and anger.\nThe **Middle Corpse** covets wealth and fights.\nThe **Lower Corpse** lusts for beauty, favoring death over life.\nEach **Reginal Day (庚申)**, it ascends to the **Upper Realm** to report to the **Lord of Fate (司命)**, denouncing a person’s sins, never their virtues—seeking early death and feasting on their blood and marrow.\nThus, the practitioner must first eliminate the **Three Worms** to avoid suffering.\n\nThis arises from **intent (志)**—a subtle **Dao** difficult to master.\nIf one encounters a **virtuous and enlightened scholar (志贤达士)**, seeking profound principles for cultivation, they may attain it.\nBut if one is **unworthy (负志)**, Heaven will punish them.\n\nWhen the **Three Worms** are eradicated, lifespan extends.\nWhen **grains are abandoned**, the worms perish of themselves.\nHumans must first observe the **Reginal Day (庚申)**, eliminating the **Three Worms**, then refine **jing-essence (精津)** into the **Great Elixir (大药)**.\n**Lead and Mercury** restrain each other—**Dragon and Tiger** do not ascend;\nthey subdue the **Five Zang Organs**, forming **True Essence (真精)**,\nwhile the **Lower Source (下元)** generates **Surge and Harmony (冲和之精)**.\n\nHold the breath to **one hundred twenty breaths**,\ngradually eliminating the **grains-worms (谷虫)**.\nAt **thirty days**, the **Upper Worm** dies.\nAt **sixty days**, the **Middle Worm** dies.\nAt **ninety days**, the **Lower Worm** perishes.\nOnce the **Three Worms** are gone, longevity and vitality endure—\neternal freedom from hunger and thirst.\n**Nurture the Golden Essence (金精)** without concern.\n\nWhen humans abandon grains and despise flavors,\nthe **Golden Essence** remains undiminished—\nthis is the **Great Elixir’s foundation**,\nthe **ancestral scripture of human vitality**:\n*\"Life is the root of death; death is the root of life.\"*\n\nFew recognize the **two roots of life and death**.\nOne who can **die to live and live to die**—\nwhen **Lead and Mercury** form the Elixir, they revive the living.\nIf one strays from the **Five Phases**, they fail to grasp the **Mystic Principle** and cannot eliminate [the worms].\n\nThis is the **Golden Essence** transforming into the **Great Elixir**.\nThe **Golden Essence** is **Mercury (汞)**;\nthe **Jade Nectar** is **Lead (铅)**.\n**Mercury** is **Metal (金)**;\n**Lead** is **Wood (木)**.\nWood is **Yang**; Metal is **Yin**—\n**Green and White** converge in the **Dan Fields**.\nThe **Central** is **Earth (土)**, **Yellow**—\ncalled the **Green, Yellow, White Elixir**.\nWhen gathered, it forms the **Purple-Gold Elixir (紫金丹)** in the **inch-square cavity**;\nwhen dispersed, it flows as **pearls**—**jewel treasures**.\n\n**Three Fields’ daily refinement**—\nninety days of practice—\nthe **Three Worms** die, grains are abandoned,\nand breath may be held to **a thousand breaths**,\nwalking underwater without drowning.\nThe **Three Officials’** realm holds **sun-moon refinement**,\nthe body becomes transparent and luminous,\nfree from worldly thoughts—\n**True Essence** flows naturally.\n\n---\n**Chapter on the Nine Domains (九域章第十六)**\nThe **Nine Domains** must be known by their **incantations**,\ntransforming **God-Essence (神精)** into **marrow and blood**.\nThe **Nine Domains** are the **mirror of the Nine Circulations (九运)**,\nalso called the **Nine Transformations’ gateway (九转之门户)**.\nThey are named:\n**1. Grain Spirit (谷神)**,\n**2. Dry Pass (乾关)**,\n**3. Hua Pool Gate (华池户)**,\n**4. Flying Gate (飞门)**,\n**5. Soul Window (魂窗)**,\n**6. Heavenly Gate (天户)**,\n**7. Sea Leak (海漏)**,\n**8. Xi-Yi Gate (希夷门)**,\n**9. Day Domain (日域)**—\ncalled the **Nine Domains**, bearing the **Nine Circulations’ hues**.\n\nAll enter through these gates.\nThe practitioner, mastering the **incantation**, closes the breath to nurture **essence (精)**—\nclosing the breath permeates the body.\n**Essence and blood** chase each other into the bones,\ntransforming into **marrow**.\nWhen marrow is full, lifespan extends—\n**immortality without death**.\n\n**Supplementing essence and marrow strengthens sinews and skin**—\nat night, **white milk** flows through the body,\n**essence transforms into blood**, blood into **essence**.\nWhen **essence is not lost**, it supplements **marrow**,\ncirculating into the **Nine Caverns (泥丸)** as **brain marrow**.\nThe flesh becomes moist, the skin white as jade, smooth and luminous—\n**sinew strength** surpasses mortals a hundredfold.\nAfter **a hundred days**, **True Essence** flows freely,\n**white milk** circulates everywhere—\nno **red blood** remains—\nthis is the **Pivotal Immortal’s rank (膀仙位)**,\ndwelling long in the world as a **True Person (真人)**.\nThis is called the **Earth Immortal (地仙)**.\n\nWhen the **Three Worms** perish, the **Dao flourishes**,\n**True Essence** flows endlessly.\nWith the **Three Worms** dead, the body thrives—\n**grains-worms** vanish, the **Five Zang Organs** fill,\n**True Essence** circulates through the body,\nbreath sustains itself.\nOne may hold it to **ten thousand breaths**,\nenter water unsoaked, enter fire unburned—\nthis is the **Day Immortal (日仙)**.\n\n**Heavenly Pass is sealed, Earthly Gate is closed**,\n**Central Official’s infant** embraces **sun and moon**.\nThe **Heavenly Pass** sealed—\n**upper and lower** cannot taste flavors,\n**grains-worms** are unattainable,\nbreath is held naturally.\nThe **Earthly Gate** is firm—\n**nothing leaks below**; both gates are closed.\nThe **Central Official** is the **Dan Field**,\nnamed the **Crucible (鼎器)**.\nWhen **Lead and Mercury** enter the **Crucible**,\nit is called **True Essence**.\nThe **infant embracing sun and moon**—\nthis is the **orthodox essence of Yin and Yang**.\n\nA **hundred years** of refinement produces a **True Person**,\n**Three Pure Ones** add the name—**Jade Emperor rejoices**.\n**A hundred years** means **a hundred days** of completion.\nEach day has **twelve periods**—\nsix **Yang**, six **Yin**—\nalso called **Meng (孟)** of **Tiger, Monkey, Dragon, Rabbit**—\nthe **Four Seasons**—\nrefining the **Golden Elixir** into a **True Person**.\nWhen the deed is done, ascending to the **Upper Realm**,\nthe **Three Corpses** are eliminated.\nThe **Three Pure Ones** observe this person’s **glowing aura (霞精)**,\ntheir name is added to the **Celestial Register**—\nthe **Jade Emperor’s face brightens**.\n\n---\n**Chapter on the Infant and Virgin (婴儿媒女章第十七)**\nWithin the **Three Palaces**, the **Infant** appears.\nThe **Three Officials** are the **Three Dan Fields**.\nThe **Infant** is the **Three Primordial Essences (三元正精)**,\nalso called **Lead (铅)**—\nor the **orthodox essence of Wood (木之正精)**, named **Wood Essence (木精)**.\n\nBefore the **Bright Hall (明堂)** is a **Jade Pool**.\nThe **Bright Hall** is the **lock-key (索钥)**,\nalso called the **Sea of Essence (精海)**—\nnamed the **Bright Hall**, or the **Chamber (洞房)**.\n\n**Yellow Grandmother** unites the **Virgin**.\nThe **Virgin** is **Mercury (汞)**,\nalso called the **essence of Metal (金之精)**, named **Moon’s Luster (月华)**.\n**Yellow Grandmother** is **Earth**, named the **Crucible (鼎)**—\nthe **essence of the Central Palace (中官之精)**.\nWhen **Lead and Mercury** meet **Earth**, they merge as one.\n**Two-one returns to the Crucible**—\n**Elixir** is formed and harmonized,\nunited within the Earth, never separating.\n\nThe **Infant** is **Lead**,\nthe **Virgin** is **Mercury**—\n**Lead and Mercury** unite,\n**Lead** is **Metal** encased in **Wood**.\n\nThe **True Yang and True Yin** are embraced by the **Central Palace**,\nwithin the **Crucible** merging into one.\nThis is the **unity without separation**—\nthe **root ancestor of the Great Elixir**.\n\nAt **dawn and dusk**, observe the **Pearls of Sun and Moon**,\neach night accompanied into the **Emerald Canopy**.\n**Dawn** is the **White Day**,\n**Dusk** is the **Night**.\n**Observing** means **qi condensing into pearls**—\ncalled **Flowing Pearls**.\n**Sun and Moon** are the **true essences of Metal and Wood**.\nWithin the **Dan Field**, there are **Sun and Moon** apart—\n**Sun** is the **essence of Yang**, **Moon** the **essence of Yin**,\ncalled the **Souls and Spirits of Sun and Moon**.\nEach night, they enter the **Emerald Canopy**—\nthis is called **Metal and Wood restraining each other**.\nThe **Emerald Canopy** is named for the **Great Elixir’s dual-essence Golden Elixir** when formed.\nWhen the **True Embryo** is perfected and refined,\nthe **True Nurturer** achieves **Embryo Liberation**—\n**refining and binding** is the **root ancestor of the Great Elixir** taking form.\n**Yellow Sprouts and White Snow** emerge—\nthis is the **silken binding**.\nThe **True Cultivator**, when the **Dan Field’s true essence solidifies**,\ntransforms countenance, reversing aging to youth—\nthis is called **Embryo Liberation**.\n\nThe **ten-month term** is the fixed cycle;\n**twenty-four essences** are arranged in order.\nYet through human cultivation, **three hundred days in ten months** forge the **Great Elixir**.\nThere are **sixty days** for **Mao and You**—\nthe **eight and two** facing each other,\nthe **number of annual bathings**; within twelve months,\nexcluding the **second and eighth months**, only ten months are used.\nWhen the **Great Elixir** is complete,\n**twenty-four names correspond to the twenty-four essences**—\nthe **full year’s nodes**.\n\nA **Son-Infant** is born at the **Crown’s Gate**.\nThe **Scholar-Cultivator**, through **Dan Field essence refinement**,\nrefines the **Golden Elixir**.\nWhen **True Yin and Yang essences** unite,\neach **visualization and storage** sees the **true essence** emerge at the **Crown’s Gate**—\nthis is the **Elder Brother-Infant**, called the **True Person wandering the Crown**.\n\n---\n**Eighteenth Chapter: The Emerald Canopy’s Glowing Essence**\n**Nurturing Spirit and Essence, the Soul’s Luminous Vitality**—\n**Ten Thousand Transformations** shift within the body.\n**Nurturing Spirit** means **essence not spilled, spirit preserved**;\nif **essence is spilled, spirit departs**.\nOnly by **cultivating body and life**, not spilling **essence**, is it called **spirit**.\nIf one **abides within essence**, the **form does not wither**.\nIf a man **frequently spills Metal essence** from the **Jade Spring**,\nhis **form decays**, his **body weakens**, and he becomes a **morning ghost**.\nIf a man **does not spill Metal essence**, his **form transcends the vulgar**,\nhis **appearance transforms**—all shifts and changes.\nWith **saliva harmonized**, the **soul enters the sacred Dao**,\nand **ten thousand creations** leave **marks of essence and spirit**—\nall **Yin records** erase from the **Death Ledger**, registering **Immortal Names** in the **Upper Realm**.\n\n**Breath can be closed for thousands**, the **Five Phases’ true essences** abiding together.\nFew who **study the Dao of body and life** succeed—\nthe **Lower Dan’s true essence** must not be spilled into **semen or breath**,\nable to **return to a thousand breaths**, becoming a **spirit-immortal**.\n**Five**—**fasting from grain and food for a hundred days** can cure illness.\nYet **only nurturing the Upper** prevents the **Five Viscera’s true essences** from exiting,\ngiving birth to **spirit at the Crown**.\n\n**Silently recite the True One**, focusing the **mind and will**—\n**jade clouds emerge at the brow**.\n**Silently recite the True One**—\n**day and night, store it in thought**.\n**Devote oneself to the Dao**—\n**immortality, first banishing the Three Corpses**:\nthe **Lower Corpse** beneath the heart, the **worms departing**.\n**Three hundred sixty breaths**, **twenty inhalations per session**, rest once—\n**four times daily**.\nAlways at **midnight and cockcrow**, recite:\n*\"The Green Tooth drinks the Morning Flower\"*—\n**three swallows**.\n*\"The Southern Vermilion Elixir, drinking from the Elixir Pool\"*—\n**three swallows**.\n*\"The Central Wild, gazing at Mount Tai, consuming the Original Essence, drinking from the Rhapsody Spring\"*—\n**three swallows**.\n*\"The Western Bright Stone, consuming and drinking the Numinous Liquid\"*—\n**three swallows**.\n*\"The Northern Mystic Nourishment, consuming and drinking the Jade Lift\"*—\n**three swallows**.\nThus, for **thirty days**, the **three worms die**, the **corpses flee**, and the **spirit-essence stabilizes**.\n\nWith **constant visualization**, **white essence** naturally appears at the brow,\nsurrounding the body—\nthis is the **Jade Cloud Spirit-Essence’s lightning flash**.\n\nAt the **nape and back**, **nine halos ride the Purple Mist**,\nthe **Three Pure Ones descend**, recording **banners and flags**.\n**Cultivating body and life**, one gains **golden bones**,\n**blood turns to white milk**, the **form emits light**,\nlater

Children** await.\nThe **Daoist Cultivator**, refining **body and life**, has **True Yin and True Yang** in the **Dan Field**,\nuniting into **Purple-Gold Elixir**—\nthe **crystallized luster of Sun and Moon’s Souls and Spirits**.\nDispersed as **Flowing Pearls**, this is **perfection and journey’s end**—\n**Luan and Feng, White Cranes, and Immortal Children** bring **Heaven’s Edicts**,\nriding

Only then may they don the **Daoist** robes of the ten directions, still the body of chaotic thoughts, and have the disciples sweep the five-directional altar within the three-tiered square *fangzhang* (altarpiece), place the incense burner, and with pure intent, burn incense while invoking the **Three Pure Ones**. Four daggers stand erect, eight mirrors hang suspended.\n\nThe scholar, holding a thousand *liang* of gold, kneels and solemnly vows, pledges, and swears before transmitting the profound secrets of the **Daoist** scriptures. Only those who cherish the **Way** with sincerity, refining the **qi** of the **Dragon** and **Tiger** (Lead and Mercury), may attain the path to **Celestial Immortality**. Yet if encountered by thieves, rogues, or those lost in vain imaginings, the **Dao** must not be divulged—such recklessness invites eternal damnation.\n\nOnly the virtuous—those who honor parents, revere the **Dao**, cherish the **Way**, and trust in the worthy—may be initiated. Unauthorized transmission brings retribution upon seven generations. For the **Great Dao** is the origin of heaven and earth, the progenitor of **Yin** and **Yang**, the foundation of transformation.\n\n---\n**Scroll One: *Jinbi Wu Xiang Lei Tantong Jing***\nAnnotated by Yinyang Changsheng\n\n**Exposition Chapter (1)**\n\nOf old, the *Paramartha Tantong Jing* (Arcane Concordance) was spoken by the **Wei** sage, where *\"Param\"* means **separation**, *\"Tong\"* means **harmonization**, and *\"Qi\"* means **union**. To those who study the **Dao** of the **Way**, this text reveals the hidden mechanisms of the **Dao** and recognizes the primordial roots.\n\n*\"Qi\"* (union) signifies the convergence of **Celestial Immortality**’s secrets with the transformations of **Yin** and **Yang**’s creative forces—this is the **Upper Concordance**. Within lies the **True Speech of Eternal Life**, elucidating the obscure yet luminous essence of the **Five Phases** in their authentic form.\n\nThe primordial roots of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations:\n**Yin** and **Yang** emerge as black generating white—this is the **One** of water. Water generates metal, the **Three**. Water is said to **separate** from **Kun** (Earth), for Earth is **Yin**, **Yin** is female, female is mother, and mother originates from **Kun**, bearing vitality—thus **Kun**.\n\nMetal resides in the northwest, belonging to **Qian** (Heaven), as **Yang**, male, father, born from **Kan** (Water). This is the primordial source of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations.\nThus the scripture states:\n*\"The **Li** (Fire) official conceals true water within its form,\nThe **Kan** (Water) gate harbors hidden authentic gold.\"*\n\nWhen **Qian** (Heaven) begets three males and **Kun** (Earth) three females, their interplay forms the **Eight Trigrams**, nurturing each other in cycles of **Eight Eights**—the **Great and Small Numbers** of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations.\n\n**Do not ask others—ask only yourself.**\nFor the **Dao** of refining the **Way** and attaining true essence lies within one’s own body. Enlightened sages comprehend this profound truth. To seek externally is to stray forever from the **Dao**.\n\nMany who do not grasp the **Dao**’s scriptures wander in confusion, searching outside themselves for truth. When will they ever attain the **Dao**’s essence?\n\nThe **Way** is singular and absolute—yet some still chase the **Five Metals** and **Eight Stones**, laboring to forge the elixir. How could such efforts ever succeed?\n\n**Cinnabar, black tin, and realgar**—when refined in the furnace, they yield **Erxi Dan** (Two Radiant Elixirs).\n**Cinnabar** is not the common cinnabar of the world.\n**Mercury** is not the common mercury of the world.\n**Black tin** is the mineral smelted from ore—this is true **Lead**. Within **Lead** lies its own refinement, its own **Silver**.\n\nThe sages take **cinnabar, black tin**, and place them in the furnace, using **realgar** as a regulator, and refine them into **Erxi Dan**. **Realgar** is not the common realgar of the world; its source is the **Wudu Mountains**, where it forms through water’s alchemy. Only with this **realgar** can the elixir be perfected.\n\n**Cinnabar** originates from the **Southern Palace**, born in the **Bing** and **Ding** (Fire) phases.\n**Black tin** comes from the **Northern Palace**, generated in the **Ren** and **Gui** (Water) phases.\n**Realgar** emerges from the **Central Palace**, thriving in the **Wu** and **Ji** (Earth) phases.\nWhen these three substances are combined in the furnace and refined into **Erxi Dan**, transformations multiply.\n\nThe **Daoist scriptures** say:\n*\"Medicine is not medicine; the furnace is not a furnace.\nTo complete the **Four Symbols**, to fulfill the **Five Phases**—\nMedicine and furnace do not depart from the body.\nSeek not outside.\"*\n\nTo seek externally is to distance oneself from **Immortal** attainment.\n\nWhen **cinnabar** and **black tin** are gently refined with **realgar**, the elixir is named **Erxi Dan**.",
