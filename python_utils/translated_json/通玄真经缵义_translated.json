He studied under Laozi. King Ping of Chu asked him, \"I have heard that you received the Dao from Lao Dan. May I be permitted to hear of it?\" Wenzi replied, \"The Dao and virtue rectify the crooked to make it straight, and restore order from chaos. When pure virtue revives, the world attains peace, and the key lies in one man. Thus, the accumulation of virtue makes a king, while the accumulation of wrath leads to ruin. Yao and Shun flourished by this principle, while Jie and Zhou perished by it.\" The king said, \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\"\n\nLater, Wenzi traveled south to Wu and Yue, where Fan Li became his disciple. When Yue planned to attack Wu, Fan Li remonstrated, \"Your servant has heard from his master: 'Weapons are instruments of ill omen. War is contrary to virtue. Strife is the least of affairs. To plot in secret and delight in instruments of ill omen, testing oneself in what is least important—this will not do.'\" Goujian did not heed him and was defeated at Fujiao. Later, Wenzi was offered the position of Grand Minister but declined. He withdrew to Mount Yu in Wuxing. Tradition holds that he ascended on clouds. According to the *Universal Geography* and the *Gazetteer of Wuxing*, thirty *li* southeast of Yuying lies Jichou Mountain, where the Grand Minister of Yue, Jiran, once ascended to survey the terrain, hence its name. Today, the Tongxuan Abbey atop White Stone Peak on the mountain’s south face marks his former retreat. The Ziyun Pass and Shengyuan Abbey were once the ancient Changqing Abbey, renamed by imperial decree during the Qiandao era of the Song. Halfway up the mountain stands the \"Cloud-Ascending Stone.\" Wenzi composed twelve chapters, titled *Wenzi*, and during the Tang dynasty, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Penetrating the Mysteries, while his book was titled *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries*.\n\n**Preface to the Comprehensive Annotations on the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries**\nThe *Wenzi* is a transmission of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Laozi based his work on the *Book of Changes* to compose his text, while Wenzi modeled himself on Laozi to establish his teachings. Thus, he elucidated the Way of the Yellow Emperor and the Three Sovereigns. For those who would be rulers, he prescribed the governance of Fuxi and the Divine Farmer; for the people, he envisioned the era of Datian and Getian. His concern for the world was profound indeed. Yet later generations failed to fathom his intent, and some even slandered his work.\n\nNow the Recluse of Nangu, Master Du, delved into the profundities of the *Book of Changes* and Laozi, harmonizing the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, ever holding the composition of texts and the establishment of discourse as his heart’s intent. Among his works that circulated in the world was *The Original Purport of the Dao and Its Virtue* in several scrolls. Initially dwelling on Mount Jishou in Wuxing, he sought the extraordinary and inquired into antiquity, discovering the former abode of Wenzi. There, he founded the White Stone Abbey of Penetrating the Mysteries and recovered *The Complete Works of Wenzi*. Thus, he divided its chapters, parsed its sentences, compiled annotations with appended explications, enabling learners to perceive the Dao with a single glance.\n\nI have often said that since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the celestial Way has flowed from north to south, and the sagely dynasty, tracing its origins, holds the primal destiny of the northern lands. Once the Six Directions are unified as one household, the age of primordial vastness is restored. Today, the Recluse of Nangu, responding to the mandate, composes texts to illuminate the imperial Dao, seeking to place this world within the realm of Huaxu. That a recluse of the mountains and forests does not forget the heart of aiding the ruler and benefiting the people is truly worthy of esteem. Our teaching has found its man, and thus I joyfully inscribe this preface.\n\nIn the third year of the Zhida era, on the first day of the sixth month, Wu Quanjie, the Lineage Master of the Mysterious Teaching, respectfully wrote.\n\nIn antiquity, when scholars served their families and states, they invariably had recluses beyond the world as their teachers, honing and tempering them, imparting their texts, and exhausting their teachings, so that their achievements were accomplished and their names established. Among them was the Grand General of Yue, Fan Li, whose teacher was Jiran. Jiran personally beheld the sages in the declining Zhou, yet harbored his supreme treasure without display. He thoroughly investigated the celestial Way, human affairs, the rise and fall of strength and weakness, and the principles of spontaneity, composing twelve scrolls. Fan Li applied these to pacify Wu and establish Yue’s hegemony, and later, with their remaining threads, preserved his life and enriched his household, accumulating and dispersing thrice, safeguarding his illustrious name. Observing Fan Li’s beginning and end confirms the truth of his teacher’s Way; examining Fan Li’s repeated remonstrances to Goujian reveals that they were all his teacher’s words. His work ranks among the Daoist masters.\n\nLiu Zihou pruned its redundancies and contradictions, extracting its essence and subtleties to form his own text, which elucidated its meaning well, though regrettably it did not survive. Master Nangu, following maps, discovered the mountain of Jiran’s former residence, perched upon its towering peaks, gazing down upon the vast expanse of Lake Tai. Having built a chamber to emulate its likeness, he further took *Wenzi* to compile annotations, fusing and penetrating its depths, smoothing its ruggedness, and unfolding the hidden treasures of the Yellow Emperor and the hegemons. Alongside his *Original Purport of the Mysterious Scripture*, it now circulates in the world. The Master is a man of the Way—his purity, diligence, frugality, and non-contention yet mastery of victory deeply embody the essence of the Keeper of the Pillars. His words and deeds, as seen in the discourses of officials and commoners alike, have already been engraved in stone and printed on fine woodblocks.\n\nYet Sima Qian’s appraisal of Tao Zhu laments his toiling body and striving strength in deep counsel with Yue, and again notes his toiling body and striving strength to amass wealth of tens of millions, repeating himself without weariness. In this, the Master’s affairs differ, yet their merit is the same; his name is lofty, yet he does not enjoy its riches. Thus, what he has gained from Jiran’s work—how could it lie in the mere ends of written characters and sentences? Separated by a thousand years, they truly seem to align as if tallying tokens.\n\nIt is regrettable that while many eminent officials and great men know the Master, and not a few have come to his gate to inquire of the Way, they have yet to fully employ his teachings as the ancients did in statecraft. Is it that their faith in the Way is not yet sincere? Do the recluses of the mountains and forests not forget this world, while the meat-eating officials do? If not, then why do they revere our Laozi’s Way as they do?\n\nThus, I record the origins of Fan Li and his teacher at the head of this text, awaiting the era of Great Flourishing.\n\nIn the mid-summer of the Gengxu year, Huang Shiweng, a Daoist of Mount Lu residing at the Lodge of the Southern Perfected, inscribed this.\n\nThose who ruled all under Heaven in antiquity: the highest practiced non-action, the next practiced action. Thus, the August One transformed through the Dao, the Emperor taught through virtue, the King exhorted through merit, and the Hegemon led through force. Their governance was like the four seasons. The celestial Way flows on its own—it is not something human effort can compel. Yet while times may be opportune for action, the Dao is never ultimately obstructed. Winter transforms, and spring endures within the year; the Hegemon transforms, and the August One endures within the ruler. This is why Wenzi composed his work, and the imperial Dao was illuminated.\n\nWenzi was a grandson of the state of Jin, surnamed Xin, named Xing, styled Jiran, and known by his epithet, Wenzi. His family resided in Kuiqiu of Sui, a region of Song, and he was also called Song Xing. He studied under Laozi and early attained the great Dao. He composed twelve scrolls, titled *Wenzi*, which returned to Laozi’s words, expounding the Way of Heaven and humanity, the appropriateness of temporal changes, and gathering the essence of all antiquity into a single compilation—truly the pivot and essentials of ordering the world. King Ping of Chu summoned him to inquire of the Way, and Fan Li followed him as his teacher, with Goujian appointing him as a grandee. Assisting Yue in pacifying Wu, he achieved merit without claiming it, retiring to the lands of Mount Yu, where he ascended the clouds and departed as an immortal. The region of Jishou in Wuxing was his former abode.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the scholar Xu Lingfu, who had secluded himself for cultivation on Mount Heng, presented Wenzi’s work to the throne. Thus, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Penetrating the Mysteries, and his book was titled *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries*.\n\nBorn on the left bank of the Yangtze and aging in the land of Wu, I sought the remnants of Wenzi’s legacy and built the White Stone Abbey of Penetrating the Mysteries. There, I obtained Wenzi’s original compilation. In my leisure, I divided its chapters and compiled annotations, assisting in the flourishing of the mysterious wind. As for the distinctions between transformation and teaching, exhortation and leading, the merit of virtue and the efficacy of force—these are not without hope for the world’s great worthies.\n\nThe humble disciple, Du Daojian of Nangu in Dangtu, respectfully inscribed this preface.\n\n**Comprehensive Annotations on the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, Scroll One**\nCompiled by Du Daojian, the Master of Nangu\n\nAt the beginning of each chapter, *Wenzi* frequently cites \"Laozi says,\" out of reverence for his teacher. This likely records Laozi’s words as they were learned at the time, and thus he dared not claim authorship for himself. The work comprises twelve scrolls, totaling one hundred and eighty-eight chapters. Though I, Daojian, am of shallow and crude understanding, I have divided them according to their meanings, adding eighty-one chapters. Each chapter is distinguished by its purport and titled *Comprehensive Annotations* to facilitate perusal.\n\n**Chapter on the Origin of the Dao**\n\nLaozi says: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth. It has appearance but no form, profound and obscure, silent and serene. No sound is heard from it. I force a name upon it and call it the Dao.\n\nNow, the Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure. It embraces Heaven and Earth, bestowing without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, empty yet never full. When turbid, it slowly clarifies through stillness. Its giving is inexhaustible, unbound by time. Though it may be held in a single grasp, it contracts yet expands, dark yet luminous, soft yet firm. It harbors yin and exhales yang, manifesting the three lights.\n\nMountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it. Beasts run by it, birds fly by it. Scales glide by it, phoenixes soar by it. Stars and constellations move by it.\n\nBy loss it gains existence, by humility it attains honor, by retreat it advances first.\n\nThe Dao originates in Heaven, and the myriad things grow thereby.\n\nThe Dao is but a forced name—what name is not forced?\n\nThus, that which gives birth to Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad things, transforms being and non-being, and eludes comprehension of its mystery is the Dao. That which pacifies the world, comforts the multitudes, governs advance and retreat, life and death, without losing its correctness is the sage.\n\nOnly by knowing the Dao can loss become existence, humility become honor, and retreat become precedence.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the essence of the Dao. Standing at the center, their spirits roamed with transformation, governing the four directions. Thus, they could turn the heavens and move the earth, wheeling without cease, flowing like water without end. They began and ended with things, wind rising and clouds forming, thunder rumbling and rain falling, all responding without limit.\n\nCarved and polished, they returned to simplicity.\n\nActing without action, they harmonized life and death. Speaking without words, they penetrated Dao and virtue. Serene and unassuming, they attained harmony. Though things differ in myriad ways, they all thrive thereby.\n\nThey harmonized yin and yang, regulated the four seasons, balanced the five phases, moistened grasses and trees, permeated metal and stone. Beasts grew large, fur and feathers lustrous. Bird eggs did not spoil, beast fetuses did not miscarry. Fathers knew no grief for lost sons, elder brothers no sorrow for dead younger brothers. Children were not orphaned, women not widowed. Rainbows did not appear, thieves did not arise—such were the fruits of embodying virtue.\n\nThe rulers of high antiquity took the Heavenly Dao as the foundation of governance, roaming in unity with creation.\n\nThus, when Dao was pure and virtue complete, the people prospered and things flourished, each fulfilling its nature.\n\nWhen the Dao was not violated, nothing was harmed.\n\nThe great constant Dao gives life without possession, transforms without dominion. The myriad things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; depend on it to die, yet none can resent it.\n\nIt gathers and stores without growing richer, distributes and bestows without becoming poorer.\n\nVague and indistinct, it cannot be grasped as form. Elusive and fleeting, its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds without shape. Penetrating and unobstructed, it moves not in vain. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang.\n\nIt gives life without being born, transforms without transforming—this is called the great constant Dao.\n\nThe sage follows it, ruling the world and cherishing the people as children.\n\nWhen transformation flows and Dao aligns, it is an age of flourishing virtue.\n\nLaozi says: The great man is tranquil and thoughtless, composed and carefree. He takes Heaven as his canopy, Earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and yin and yang as his drivers.\n\nHe travels where there are no roads, roams without weariness, departs without gates.\n\nTaking Heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered. Taking Earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. Taking the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded. Taking yin and yang as his drivers, nothing is left unguided.\n\nThus, he moves swiftly without swaying, travels far without fatigue. His limbs do not stir, his hearing and vision do not falter, yet he illuminates all under Heaven—this is the essence of holding the Dao and observing the boundless.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and guide them. The changes of the myriad things cannot be fathomed; one must grasp their essentials and return to them.\n\nThus, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. He sharpens his spirit and stills his knowledge and perceptions. Thus, he is effortlessly without action yet accomplishes all, governs without governing yet nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nThe so-called \"non-action\" is not acting before things do. The so-called \"non-governance\" is not altering the natural. The so-called \"nothing left ungoverned\" is following the mutual arising of things.\n\nThe Dao resides within me, uniting with Heaven as one.\n\nA state’s ministers and aides are like Heaven’s seasons and times.\n\nWhen the great man emerges to assist a wise ruler, governing the people’s fate, observing the celestial timing, understanding the principles of things, following the Dao of nature, and enacting the transformation of non-action, then his person is cultivated, and governance knows no disorder.\n\nLaozi says: He who holds the Dao to govern the people responds to events as they arise, follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their answer; the changes of the hundred affairs all find their match.\n\nThus, the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these five are the forms and images of the Dao.\n\nEmptiness and nothingness are the Dao’s abode. Levelness and ease are the Dao’s essence. Clarity and stillness are the Dao’s mirror. Softness and weakness are the Dao’s function. Reversion is the Dao’s constant. Softness is the Dao’s hardness. Weakness is the Dao’s strength. Purity and simplicity are the Dao’s trunk.\n\nThe great Dao has no form; great peace has no image—hence, emptiness and nothingness.\n\nLevelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these are the Dao.\n\nAs for forms and images, are they truly forms? Are they truly images? Only he who does not cling to forms and images and thereby attains the use of the profound and mysterious can be spoken to of the Dao of governing the people.\n\nEmptiness means the center bears no burden. Levelness means the heart harbors no cares. Desires and cravings not borne—this is the perfection of emptiness. No preferences or aversions—this is the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity—this is the perfection of stillness. Unmixed with things—this is the perfection of purity. Neither sorrow nor joy—this is the perfection of virtue.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate is centered in emptiness; spirit and clarity abide with it. When a person’s heart is empty, the Dao naturally resides within. If even one thing is borne, desires and cravings will obstruct; likes and dislikes will arise, and spirit will depart. When spirit departs, the Dao is lost—how then can the body not perish? Only one of perfect virtue remains unmixed with things, unwavering in unity, the heart empty and qi level—what sorrow or joy could there be?\n\nThe governance of the perfected person discards cleverness and erases ornamentation, relying on the Dao and abandoning cunning, emerging with the people from impartiality. Narrowing what is guarded, reducing what is sought, casting aside allurements and desires, diminishing thoughts and cares—narrowing what is guarded brings clarity; reducing what is sought brings attainment. Thus, with the inner regulating the outer, no affair is neglected. If the inner attains, the outer can be shepherded. When the inner attains, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts are level, sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes are keen.\n\nThe great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—those who seek it afar go forth only to return. Ornament obscures substance; broad learning drowns the heart. When the external is heavy, the internal is light—thus the great man dwells in reality, not in its blossoms.\n\nThe governance of the perfected person has no other way—reverent silence and non-action alone. Turning inward to seek the Dao—how distant is it? Laozi said: The sage forgets governing others and attends to self-cultivation; esteems forgetting power and position and attends to self-attainment—self-attainment is when the world attains me. Joy forgets wealth and honor and attains harmony; knowing the great self and diminishing the world—this approaches the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. The sage is without fame, not forgetting their merit; the spirit person is without merit, not forgetting the self. The perfected person is without self—not that they lack a body, but that they enlarge the self and diminish the world.\n\nOnly those who act with something to rely upon—thus the sage’s great treasure is position. The Dao shapes and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, beginning and ending without form, still and unmoving, greatly penetrating and profoundly obscure, vast and boundless—it cannot be made external; splitting the finest hair or dividing the smallest point cannot make it internal. Without walls or roof, it gives birth to the general name of being and non-being.\n\nThe true person embodies it with emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity, remaining unmixed with things—thus attaining the Dao of heaven and earth, and so called a true person. The Dao has no form, thus it can shape and nurture the ten thousand things; the Dao has no name, thus it can encompass all existents. The true person embodies the Dao, emptying the heart and stilling the spirit—thus attaining the Dao of heaven and earth.\n\nThe true person enlarges the self and diminishes the world, esteems governing the body and disdains governing others, does not allow things to disturb harmony, does not let desires confuse the emotions, conceals their name and identity—when the Dao is present, they remain hidden; when the Dao is absent, they appear. They practice non-action, engage in non-affairs, know non-knowing.\n\nEmbracing the great Dao, encompassing the heart of heaven, exhaling and inhaling yin and yang, expelling the old and taking in the new, closing with yin, opening with yang, rolling and unfolding with hardness and softness, bowing and rising with yin and yang, sharing the heart of heaven, sharing the body of the Dao. Without joy, without suffering, without delight, without anger, the myriad things are profoundly the same—without right, without wrong.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the body is exhausted and spirit is blocked; when spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and care, spirit is spent and the body remains in excess. Thus the true person employs the heart to restore nature, relying on spirit for mutual support, thereby attaining beginning and end. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is without sorrow.\n\nBending outwardly—this is the human Dao; straightening inwardly—this is the heavenly Dao. Inwardly straight and outwardly bending, heaven and humanity correspond—there has never been one who did not succeed. Thus the true person conceals their name and identity—when the Dao is present, they remain hidden, not usurping others’ merit; when the Dao is absent, they appear, to remedy the age’s ills.\n\nOnly one who shares the heart of heaven and the body of the Dao can restore nature and rely on spirit, mutually supporting to attain beginning and end. Confucius asked the Dao of Laozi, who said: Correct your form, unify your gaze, and heavenly harmony will arrive; gather your knowledge, rectify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, the Dao will be your abode. Bright-eyed as a newborn calf, without seeking the old; form like withered wood, heart like dead ashes—truly knowing reality without crookedness, thus self-sustaining and expansive, no heart to scheme, luminous in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\n\nThe Dao has substance and function; the sage has no dual heart. The mysterious sage and the unadorned king—substance and function are two, but the Dao is one. Confucius, a sage of heaven’s endowment—how could he not know the Dao? Yet he asked Laozi, surely to gain what lies beyond words. Thus there is the deception of the dragon.\n\nLaozi said: One who attends to life responds to change and acts; change arises from the times—one who knows the times has no constant conduct. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Writing arises from words; words emerge from knowledge—those with knowledge do not know, for it is not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not one who hoards books.\n\nExcessive words lead to exhaustion—better to guard the center. Cut off learning and be without sorrow; cut off sagacity and abandon knowledge, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Books carry words; words carry the Dao. Esteeming books is esteeming the Dao. Thus, one who knows the times responds to change when affairs arise; one who knows books—words emerge from knowledge, but those with knowledge do not know.\n\nOnly by not clinging to books nor stagnating in affairs, cutting off learning and abandoning knowledge, can one begin to speak of the art of responding to change.\n\nMan is tranquil at birth—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, he stirs—this is the desire of nature. When things arrive, he responds—this is the movement of knowledge. As knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise; when likes and dislikes take form, knowledge turns outward, unable to return to the self, and Heaven’s principle is extinguished. Thus, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, outwardly transforming with things while inwardly preserving true nature. Therefore, one who penetrates the Dao returns to clarity and stillness; one who exhausts things ends in non-action. Nurture knowledge with tranquility, unite the spirit with emptiness—thus entering the gateless gate.\n\nThose who follow Heaven wander with the Dao; those who follow men mingle with the vulgar. Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, nor disorder true nature with desires. Without scheming, he is fitting; without speaking, he is trusted; without pondering, he attains; without acting, he accomplishes. Therefore, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands before them, none feel harmed. The world turns to him, the wicked fear him, for he contends with nothing—who then would dare contend with him?\n\nHeaven’s nature is fundamentally still; worldly desires disturb it. When stillness moves, Heaven’s nature is defiled. Only the sage, outwardly transforming with things while his heart wanders with Heaven, merges self and other in profound unity—what contention could there be?\n\nLaozi said: \"When man follows desire, he loses his nature; his movements are never upright. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to invite defilement.\" Thus, those who have not heard the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain clarity and stillness. Human nature is originally free from depravity—long immersed in things, it changes; changing, it forgets its root and merges with what seems natural.\n\nWater’s nature desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it; man’s nature desires equilibrium, yet cravings harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. Thus, the sage does not enslave things with knowledge, nor disturb harmony with desire. In joy, he is not exuberant; in sorrow, he is not distressed. Therefore, though exalted, he is not imperiled; though secure, he does not topple. Hearing good words and expedient plans, even the foolish delight in them; praising sagely virtue and lofty conduct, even the unworthy admire them. Many delight in such words, but few employ them; many admire such conduct, but few practice it. The reason lies in being entangled by things and bound by custom.\n\nThus it is said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I am without affairs, and the people prosper themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people simplify themselves.\" When the heart is still, it is bright; when water is still, it is clear—this is principle. If learning is not upright, habit shapes nature, and stillness becomes movement, clarity becomes obscurity. Encountering a worthy teacher and hearing good words, if the heart awakens, one may restore one’s nature.\n\nOriginally, Heaven united with the great Dao. Applying this to cultivate the self perfects the self; applying it to govern the state perfects the state. Thus, the sage’s Dao is this: above, he practices non-action, and the people transform themselves; above, he is without affairs, and the people prosper themselves; above, he loves stillness, and the people rectify themselves; above, he is without desire, and the people simplify themselves.\n\nClarity and stillness are the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the myriad things. When these three are practiced, one merges with the formless—the formless is called the One. The One is the mindless union with all under Heaven.\n\nVirtue is spread without irrigation; its use is not labored. It is seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard. From the formless, forms arise; from the soundless, the five notes resound; from the tasteless, the five flavors take shape; from the colorless, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, fullness from emptiness.\n\nThe number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible to the ear; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are inexhaustible to the palate; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are inexhaustible to the eye. When the note *gong* is established, the five notes take form; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; when whiteness is established, the five colors are complete; when the One is established, the myriad things are born.\n\nThus, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the blessing of the One pervades Heaven and Earth. In its wholeness, it is simple as uncarved wood; in its dispersion, it is vast as turbid waters. Turbid, it gradually clears; empty, it gradually fills. Vast as the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent yet present, seemingly lost yet existing.\n\nThe Dao is formless yet gives birth to form, beginning in the beginningless, ending in the endless. The primordial qi arises from the Great Simplicity. Is the Great Simplicity not the ancestor of the myriad things? From the One come the Two, and yin and yang divide; the five qi spread, and the myriad transformations flourish.\n\nThe sage’s heart unites with the Great Simplicity—clear, still, empty, and void. Virtue covers the four seas, and the myriad things return to him, yet he does not act as their master. The Dao is great and formless, one with Heaven. As for the ear’s delight in sound, the eye’s delight in color, the mouth’s delight in flavor—these are what man shares with others. How could the sage take them to heart?\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the myriad things all passes through one opening; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from one gate.\" Thus, the sage follows the single standard, does not alter the ancient ways, does not change the constant norms. He takes the level as his model, the plumb line as his guide, bending and conforming to the constant.\n\nJoy and anger are the Dao’s perversities; sorrow and grief are virtue’s losses; likes and dislikes are the heart’s transgressions; cravings and desires are life’s burdens. Great anger shatters yin; great joy collapses yang; thin qi brings dimness; terror induces madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, and illness forms as accumulations. If one can eliminate these five, one unites with spirit brightness.\n\nSpirit brightness is attained within. Those who attain it within find their five viscera at peace, thoughts and deliberations balanced, ears and eyes keen, sinews and bones strong and straight. Open and unobstructed, not perverse; firm and strong, not exhausted. Nothing in excess, nothing unattainable.\n\nThe Dao, does it not embrace all mysteries and encompass the myriad things? Through spirit it is made luminous, through resonance it is made penetrating—revealing the hidden, elucidating the subtle, present without exception. Thus, things obtain it and flourish; the people obtain it and thrive; the timely ruler obtains it and may embody the august standard to govern the four quarters.\n\nNothing in the world is more yielding than water, yet in water lies the Dao. Its breadth cannot be fathomed, its depth cannot be sounded; its length stretches without end, its reach extends without limit. Its ebb and flow, its gain and loss, surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes heaven’s rain and dew; below, it becomes earth’s moisture and nourishment. Without it, the myriad things cannot live; without it, the hundred affairs cannot be accomplished. It embraces all life without partiality, bestows grace upon dragons and serpents without seeking repayment, enriches the world without exhaustion, extends virtue to the people without depletion. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Bind it and it is not constrained; pierce it and it is not wounded; sever it and it is not cut; scorch it and it is not scorched. Flowing and compliant, it cannot be scattered; its benefit penetrates metal and stone, pervades the world. Surplus or deficiency, it allows the world to take or give; it receives the myriad things without preference, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal to heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.\n\nThat water can perfect its utmost virtue lies in its softness, compliance, and smoothness. Thus it is said: The softest in the world gallops through the hardest; nothing enters where there is no gap. The One generates water, which beneficially nourishes the myriad things—its merit is most vast. Heaven without water cannot revolve; earth without water cannot bear; things without water cannot live; the people without water cannot survive. Rain and dew in the four seasons moisten and nourish all species. Flowing and compliant, dwelling below without contention, Yu’s virtue resembled it—thus he could accord with water’s nature and bring the earth to order, heaven to completion.\n\nThe formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great progenitor of kinds. The perfected person communicates with the numinous treasury, becoming one with the creator, holding profound virtue in the heart, and transforming like a spirit. Thus, the Dao that is not a Dao—how vast and indistinct it is! Without issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the power of conduct in the heart.\n\nThe myriad things have their origins, yet only the Dao knows their roots; the hundred affairs have their sources, yet only the Dao guards their gates. Thus it can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond without knowing. The Dao has no fixed form; it assumes form according to things—transformation is manifest. Virtue has no constant teacher; it takes goodness as its teacher—substance and function are attained.\n\nThus the perfected person harbors the Dao and virtue, communicates with spirit brightness. Things have their origins—only the Dao knows their roots. Affairs have their sources—only the Dao guards their gates. Inexhaustible and boundless, it becomes one with the creator. Laozi said: Those who attain the Dao have a will that is weak yet their affairs are strong; their hearts are empty yet their responses are fitting. A weak will is soft, delicate, tranquil, concealed in not daring, acting in not being able, serene and non-active, moving without missing the moment. Thus the noble must take the lowly as its foundation, the high must take the low as its base. Relying on the small to embrace the great, being within to control the external, acting with softness yet being firm, its strength is invincible, its enemies undefeatable. Responding to transformations and measuring the times, nothing can harm it.\n\nThose who desire firmness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes firmness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or demise. Strength overcomes what is inferior to itself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is checked. Softness overcomes what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, when armies are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break; when leather is strong, it splits. The teeth are firmer than the tongue yet perish first. Thus softness and weakness are the stems of life; firmness and strength are the companions of death. When things turn against me, the Dao abides in the heart.\n\nKnowing my heaven, knowing others’ heaven, and knowing things’ heaven—this is attainment. Water is utterly soft, yet when it bears a boat, it is firm; the people are utterly weak, yet when they support a ruler, they are strong. Those who skillfully employ the Dao can guard softness and weakness to overcome firmness and strength. The first to sing paves the path to exhaustion; the last to act reaches the source of success.\n\nThose who hold the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, they control the other. Why? They do not lose what controls others, and others cannot control them. The so-called \"last\" adjusts its calculations to align with the time. When time changes, the interval does not allow for pause. Acting first is excessive; acting last is insufficient. The sun revolves, the moon cycles—time does not wait for people. Thus the sage does not value a foot of jade but values an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easy to lose, so the sage acts according to the time, establishes merit according to resources, upholds the pure Dao, adheres to the feminine principle, follows along and responds to change, always remaining behind yet never ahead. Soft and weak in stillness, tranquil and composed in stability, their achievements are vast and nothing is too firm—they cannot be contested.\n\nWhen affairs arise, respond—the Dao values attaining the mean. Excess and deficiency both harm affairs. Only by not losing the proper time in first and last is the mean attained and all affairs accomplished. Thus the sage’s appearance and withdrawal are timely, their first and last have measure. If I do not lose control over others, then others cannot control me.\n\nLaozi said: When the heart harbors scheming, purity is not unsullied. When spiritual virtue is not complete in the body, how can one embrace what is distant? When the heart forgets the desire to harm, even a starving tiger can be tailed—how much more so with people?\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet not exhausted; those who rely on calculations are laborious yet without achievement. Ruling through laws, punishments, and executions is not the enterprise of emperors and kings; frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to govern for the long term. Excessive likes and dislikes bring calamity in their wake. Thus the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld.\n\nThus, to follow is great, to create is petty; to uphold is firm, to act is to fail. Grasping at schemes and pursuing a starving tiger—one barely escapes the tiger’s jaws. Only when I harbor no scheming heart does the tiger bring no harm.\n\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao are at ease, while those who rely on calculations are laborious. The principles of the world are not difficult to perceive: what is easy is readily known, what is simple is readily followed. When laws lack the harshness of punishments, governance becomes effortless; when governance dispenses with the frequent use of the whip, it can endure for the long term. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions were not to suppress evil but to uphold what was right. Only thus could they establish a lasting and great enterprise.\n\nThose who rely on ears and eyes for hearing and seeing exhaust the heart yet remain unclear; those who govern through cunning and planning strain the heart yet achieve nothing. Relying on the talents of one person is insufficient to bring order; the ability of one person cannot even govern a three-acre homestead. Yet by following the principles of the Dao and aligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth, the Six Directions are not too vast to harmonize.\n\nTo lose judgment in praise or blame, to be dazzled by gaudy colors, to rely on ritual alone is insufficient to restrain desire—only a sincere heart can embrace what is distant. Thus, no weapon is sharper than the will, yet fine blades are inferior; no enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet war drums are trivial. The greatest foe lies in unspoken restraints, the middling hides in the mountains, the petty lurks among the people.\n\nThus it is said: when the people abound in cleverness, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits flourish. To reject one and adopt the other is to invite no heavenly calamity. Therefore, to govern a state through cunning is to plunder it; to govern without cunning is to bless it. When seeing and hearing are labored, the heart is unclear; when schemes and plans are overburdened, affairs are ungoverned. To rely on the talents of one person to seek order is difficult indeed.\n\nA sincere heart can embrace what is distant; collective strength can achieve success—even the Six Directions are not too vast to harmonize. What ails the body is crowned by yin and yang; what plunders the state is crowned by treachery. To govern without cunning is the fortune of the state.\n\nWhat is formless is great, what has form is petty; what is formless is abundant, what has form is scant; what is formless is strong, what has form is weak; what is formless is solid, what has form is hollow. What has form is the completion of affairs, what is formless is their inception. The completion of affairs produces tools, their inception is uncarved simplicity. What has form has sound, what is formless has no sound; what has form arises from what is formless—thus what is formless is the beginning of what has form.\n\nVastness and thickness bear names, and what bears a name is prized for its wholeness; frugality and thinness are nameless, and what is nameless is base and light. Abundance bears a name, and what bears a name is honored and esteemed; poverty and scarcity are nameless, and what is nameless is lowly and despised. The male bears a name, and what bears a name manifests virtue; the female is nameless, and what is nameless remains hidden and restrained. Surplus bears a name, and what bears a name is exalted and wise; deficiency is nameless, and what is nameless is assigned to the lowly. Merit brings a name, lack of merit brings none. What bears a name arises from what is nameless—what is nameless is the mother of what bears a name.\n\nThe Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete one another. Thus the sage holds to the Dao’s emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery to perfect their virtue. Therefore, where there is the Dao, there is virtue; where there is virtue, there is merit; where there is merit, there is a name; where there is a name, there is a return to the Dao. Merit and name endure, and one remains free from fault throughout life.\n\nAll things under Heaven arise from being, being arises from non-being—thus what is formless is the beginning of what has form. The Dao is nameless, things bear names, yet the nameless is the mother of what bears a name. Know which is closer: name or self? Which is weightier: self or wealth? Then name need not be exalted, wealth need not be abundant.\n\nThus the sage holds to the Dao to perfect their virtue. With merit accomplished, they withdraw—from ancient times to the present, their name does not fade. Kings and lords possess merit and name, the orphaned and widowed possess neither. Thus it is said: the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root. With merit accomplished, they do not claim it—thus they use merit for benefit and namelessness for function.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their appearance did not depart from their nature, their words did not exceed their actions, their conduct required no adornment, their speech was unembellished. Their clothes provided warmth without ornament, their weapons were blunt and unsharpened. They walked with unsteady steps, gazed with unfocused eyes, dug wells to drink, tilled fields to eat. They neither bestowed nor sought virtue. High and low did not vie, long and short did not compare.\n\nCustoms were uniform and could be followed, tasks matched abilities and were easily performed. Those who flaunted deceit to delude the world or behaved erratically to mislead the masses—the sage did not make this the people’s way.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their speech was unadorned, their clothes uncolored. They tilled to eat, dug wells to drink, neither bestowed nor sought, each content with their own.\n\nThus kings and great lords called themselves orphaned and widowed, and those who possessed the Dao did not destroy themselves for name, did not kill the people with governance, did not exhaust descendants with wealth, did not harm the world with learning. Later generations did not burden their hearts with merit, name, profit, or emolument. Who would willingly flaunt deceit to delude the world or behave erratically to mislead the masses?\n\n*Comprehensive Exegesis of the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, Scroll One, Complete.*\n\n**Comprehensive Exegesis of the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, Scroll Two**\n*South Valley Master Du Daojian’s Annotated Compilation*\n\n**Chapter on Sincerity**\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun and moon shine, the stars in their ranks gleam; yin and yang harmonize—yet none of this is by deliberate action.\n\nAlign with the Dao, and things arise of themselves. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nurture grasses and trees. Yet when numinous clarity meets, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within, shelters spirit in the heart, still and silent, serene and unperturbed, joyfully at peace in the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless—government offices as if empty, the court as if deserted. No recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. All under heaven gaze upward in reverence of the ruler’s virtue, in emulation of the sovereign’s intent. Even distant lands of alien customs, none fail to arrive through successive interpreters—not because they journey to each household to meet the people, but because the ruler extends his sincere heart to all under heaven.\n\nThus, to reward the good and punish the violent is to issue commands; what enables their execution is sincerity. Commands, though clear, cannot act alone—they must await sincerity. Therefore, when the Dao is universally applied to the people yet they do not follow, it is because sincerity has not reached them.\n\nThe sages of antiquity governed heaven and earth, administered the myriad things, stored essence and preserved sincerity—formless and soundless. They aligned with the Dao and entrusted things to their own nature. In that age, the court had no favored ministers, the wilds no neglected recluses, the state no vagrant people. Weapons were not raised, labor was not imposed, and the four classes delighted in their work. Thus, without visiting each household to instruct the people, supreme peace was effortlessly achieved.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven established the sun and moon, arrayed the stars, extended the four seasons, and regulated yin and yang. Day exposes, night rests; wind dries, rain and dew moisten. In generating things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things perish—this is called numinous clarity.\n\nThus, the sage emulates this: when blessings arise, none see their cause, yet blessings arise; when calamities are removed, none see their source, yet calamities vanish. Searched, they cannot be found; examined, they are not empty. Daily reckoning falls short, yearly reckoning exceeds. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is the movement of the celestial heart through transformation.\n\nThus, sincerity shapes qi within, moving heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. Rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge. The sun, moon, and stars are the spirits of heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone are the spirits of earth. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night—all are spirits. Human nature is most numinous, surpassing all things in spirit.\n\nHeaven nurtures things without revealing its care, yet daily they grow. The sage nurtures the people, removing harm and promoting benefit, doing likewise. All arises from sincerity manifesting within, qi moving heaven, yin and yang aligning, numinous spirits aiding—thus auspicious omens arrive.\n\nTo defy heaven and ravage things is to invite the sun and moon’s eclipse, the five stars’ misalignment, the four seasons’ disorder. Day darkens, night brightens; mountains collapse, rivers run dry; winter thunders, summer frosts. Heaven and humanity communicate thus. When a state declines, celestial signs alter, customs decay, rainbows appear—all things interconnect, essence and qi clash.\n\nTherefore, the workings of the numinous cannot be achieved by cunning or forced by strength. Thus, the great person joins virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon, numinosity with ghosts and spirits, and trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing the celestial heart, holding the earthly qi, grasping the mean and containing harmony, they do not leave their hall yet traverse the four seas, transforming customs. The people reform as if by their own will—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\nHeaven and humanity share one qi, the hidden and manifest interpenetrate. Harmonious qi brings blessings; pestilential qi brings misfortune—none arise apart from the ruler. Thus, to defy heaven and ravage things, to violate the Dao and corrupt virtue, is to provoke the wrath of august heaven, and calamity follows.\n\nAs when King Cheng repented his errors, the grain stalks bent and the wind reversed; when the Lord of Song spoke a single word, the Fire Star retreated—these were signs of sincerity moving heaven, turning misfortune to fortune.\n\nLaozi said: The human Dao is to preserve one’s nature and guard one’s authenticity, not to harm one’s body. When pressed by urgency or peril, essence connects with heaven. Those who have never departed from their origin—what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced.\n\nMoreover, to govern heaven and earth, administer the myriad things, return to the creative process, and contain supreme harmony is to never die. Sincerity takes shape within and outwardly resonates with the human heart—this is the untransmitted Dao.\n\nIn life, all receive their mandate from heaven alike. Thus, nature is not without goodness. To preserve one’s nature and guard one’s authenticity, not to harm one’s body, to connect essence with heaven—what could not be achieved? To return to the creative process, contain supreme harmony, and never die—this is the true person.\n\nWhen the sage rules above, embracing the Dao without speech, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—how vast and boundless! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit manifests in heaven, and the mutual resonance of spirit and qi is evident. This is the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken Dao.\n\nTo summon the distant, let there be no action; to draw close, let there be no speech. Only those who walk in darkness can attain this. Thus, horses are turned back to manure the fields, and chariot tracks do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called \"sitting in stillness while galloping in obscurity.\"\n\nThe Dao of heaven is impartial in its approach, impartial in its departure—those who are capable have abundance, while the inept fall short. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it meet misfortune. Thus, governing through cunning makes it difficult to sustain a state; only by aligning with the Great Harmony and adhering to natural resonance can one attain this. The sage embraces the Dao, and his beneficence reaches the people—auspicious signs become visible. When ruler and minister diverge in heart, calamity manifests in heaven. The distant are summoned without action; the near are drawn close without speech. The mutual resonance of spirit and *qi* is evident—what need is there for summoning before they arrive?\n\nImpartial in approach, impartial in departure, abundance and insufficiency—all align with the Great Harmony. The teaching without words is simply the natural course. Laozi said: The Dao and virtue are like leather and hide—distance makes them seem near, closeness makes them seem distant. Scrutiny yields no grasp, observation finds no emptiness. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without hoarding. The myriad things are unharmed—what he gains is but loss, what he loses is but gain.\n\nTherefore, one who penetrates the Great Harmony is dark as if steeped in wine, sweetly reclining and roaming within it, as if never having departed from its source—this is called \"great penetration.\" This is the use that arises from non-use. The Dao is revered, virtue is esteemed—they differ in name but emerge from the same source, residing within our hearts, not obtained from without. It gives life and nurtures, neither non-existent nor existent.\n\nThe heart of the sage is like a bright mirror: things arrive and it responds; things depart and it is still. Embracing sincerity, pure in virtue and power—what failure could there be? Without attachment, what loss could occur? As if never having departed from its source, even spirits and gods cannot discern it.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ruled the world, harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the *qi* of yin and yang, ordering the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the calculations of pitch and calendar. He distinguished male and female, clarified superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not tyrannize the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were harmonious without blame. Laws and decrees were clear, not obscure; assistants were just, not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets did not engage in preemptive pricing. Thus, in that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts. Observing the Dao of heaven and grasping its workings, the Yellow Emperor attained governance of the world. Later, he relinquished the world, hastened to Kongtong, humbled himself to seek instruction, and asked Guangchengzi how to cultivate the body to achieve longevity.\n\nGuangchengzi said: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure. Its ultimate is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The body will naturally rectify itself—be still, be pure. Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence—only then can you attain long life.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on stone and slept on rope, slaying in autumn and executing in winter. He bore the square earth and embraced the round heaven, enveloped by yin and yang. Those obstructed and stagnant—where *qi* and principle were perverse, harming the people and accumulating excess—he severed and halted them. His people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west, their sight dim, their steps faltering. Yet they were artless and content, unaware of their drifting, floating without knowing their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing their destination.\n\nIn that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons—their achievements matched heaven and earth. Yet when the Yellow Emperor sought counsel beneath the Great Ancestor, he did not display his merits or proclaim his name, concealing the Dao of the true person to follow the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. Why? Because virtue and power ascend while cunning and artifice vanish.\n\nWhen the Six Eras neared their end and the Two Sovereigns did not appear, then Taihao Fuxi emerged. At that time, the Great Simplicity dispersed, and human affairs began to sprout—the world first saw action. Observing images, he fashioned tools; knotting cords into nets, he tamed birds and beasts. This was called Fuxi. Smelting metal into cauldrons, transforming raw into cooked, he was also named Paoxi. In that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes sheathed their claws and fangs, no longer harming people. Later, when he created writing and rectified human relations, his achievements matched heaven and earth, yet he did not regard them as accomplishments. Thus, he was revered as Taihao—was this not fitting?\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have no place to rest; if earth is unsettled, plants and trees have no place to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Thus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise. If what one holds is unclear, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance?\n\nAccumulating kindness and valuing wealth, making the people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, ordering ruler and minister, clarifying superior and inferior, distinguishing close and distant, preserving imperiled states, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. Closing the nine orifices, concealing will and intent, discarding wisdom and intelligence, returning to non-discernment, wandering blithely beyond the dust, roaming freely in the realm of no affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is virtue.\n\nThus, the Dao disperses into virtue, virtue overflows into benevolence and righteousness, and when benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned. The Dao and virtue in relation to the Five Constants are like yin and yang in relation to the Five Phases—they are one. Knowing that the sun and moon alternate in brightness, the four seasons proceed in succession, and only then is the year completed—this is understanding the human Dao. The Dao, virtue, and the Five Constants can coexist but cannot be without one another.\n\nThus, Laozi said: \"Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom; abandon benevolence, discard righteousness.\" Why? Because he detested their names being usurped and enacted falsely. If one truly had the heart to abandon them, then the *Dao* and *De* chapters would not speak of sages or benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the spirit scatters, words become florid; when virtue dissipates, conduct turns false. When the utmost essence radiates within yet speech and action are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things.\" When essence is exhausted through sorrow and conduct knows no bounds, what one holds fast to is unstable, and one becomes externally swayed by worldly customs.\n\nTherefore, the sage cultivates the Dao and virtue internally and does not adorn them externally with benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, they wander in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering. The Dao and virtue are the ancestors of the Five Constants; to have ancestors without descendants is impossible. Yet to have descendants while forgetting the ancestors—is this permissible? The Five Constants are the five spirits. When the Dao and virtue reside within, the spirit does not scatter without. Once one loses what they guard, the spirit scatters and words become florid, virtue dissipates and conduct turns false—few escape enslavement by things.\n\nOnly the sage, knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, wanders in the harmony of spirit—when the ancestor is preserved, how can the descendants not be preserved? Laozi said: \"As for the sage’s wandering, they move in perfect emptiness, roam the mind in the Great Void, gallop beyond boundaries, act without gates, listen without sound, see without form, unbound by the world, unshackled by custom.\" Thus, what the sage uses to move the world is not surpassed by the true person; what the worthy use to correct worldly customs is not observed by the sage.\n\nPeople bound by worldly customs inevitably have their forms constrained and spirits drained, and thus cannot escape entanglement. If what binds and restrains me must lie in something external, then when the body is not shackled by custom, others will not weary of me. When the mind is not bound by the world, I will not weary of others—this is called wandering with the Creator. Thus, what moves the world is not surpassed by the true person, and what corrects worldly customs is not observed by the sage.\n\nWhen the will is enslaved by things, the form is constrained and the spirit drained—even the worthy cannot always escape this, let alone the common people. Laozi said: \"The ruler’s thoughts do not manifest in the breast, nor does wisdom extend beyond the four quarters. Embracing a heart of benevolence and sincerity, timely sweet rains fall, the five grains flourish, spring births, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores. Monthly inspections and seasonal assessments are conducted, and tribute is offered at year’s end. Nurturing the people with impartiality, awe is instilled without admonition, laws are simple and not burdensome, transformation is as if divine, punishments are lenient and prisons empty. The world shares one custom, and none harbor treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s grace.\n\nWhen superiors covet without measure, inferiors vie for merit without restraint. The people grow poor and bitter, disputes arise, toil yields no reward, cunning and deceit sprout, thieves and bandits multiply, superiors and inferiors resent one another, and decrees go unheeded. When carriages share the same tracks and writing the same script, the world shares one custom. When rewards are not excessive and punishments not cruel, the four seas unite in heart. If this is achieved, the ruler’s thoughts do not extend beyond the four quarters, and transformation is as if divine.\n\nWhen superiors covet without limit, inferiors vie for merit without restraint. Cunning arises and the people’s strength is depleted; superiors and inferiors resent one another, heaven and earth do not interact, and the myriad things do not communicate. When water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When superiors are full of desires, inferiors grow deceitful; when superiors are restless, inferiors are unsettled; when superiors make many demands, inferiors contend with one another. To neglect the root and seek remedy in the branches is no different from digging channels to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire.\n\nThe sage’s affairs are few, their demands for governance minimal yet sufficient. Without acting, they are benevolent; without speaking, they are trusted; without seeking, they obtain; without striving, they accomplish. Embracing naturalness, preserving utmost sincerity, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows them as echo responds to sound, as shadow reflects form—what they cultivate is the root. Heaven displays omens to show good and ill fortune, and all see them. The ruler issues commands, clarifies rewards and punishments, and the people all trust them. Is the ruler not like heaven?\n\nWhen water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel—this is the inevitable principle. Thus, when superiors are full of desires, the people grow deceitful; when superiors favor stillness, the people do not contend. The sage, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, is followed by the world—this may be called knowing the root.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the spirit scatters without and wisdom dissipates within, governance cannot be achieved. When the use of form and spirit is distant, what is neglected is near. Thus, one who does not step beyond the door knows the world; one who does not peer through the window knows the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows—this speaks of essence and sincerity issuing from within, and spirit and qi moving heaven.\"\n\nHeaven and earth interact, and the myriad things communicate; the sage arises, and the myriad things behold—this is the Dao of natural resonance. The human heart connects with heaven, for in receiving form and destiny, one’s origin is from heaven itself. Thus, when essence and sincerity issue from within, spirit and qi move heaven. When the human heart is empty and bright, the light of heaven shines forth, like a mirror reflecting form—beauty and ugliness appear of themselves. How can the heart not be guarded?\n\nLaozi said: \"The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—all things return to them without limit. This is the resonance of utmost essence, coming unsummoned, departing without going, profound and obscure, accomplishing its work without one knowing how. To rely on the eyes to see or words to command makes governance difficult. Gaoyao was blind yet served as grand judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for words? Shi Kuang was blind yet served as grand minister, and the state of Jin knew no chaotic governance—what need was there for sight? The command that requires no words, the vision that requires no seeing—this is how the sage serves as teacher.\n\nThe burning mirror summons fire, yet without the sun, it does not flame; the square vessel summons water, yet without the moon, it does not flow. Thus, with the Dao but without position, affairs cannot be established.\"\n\nWith position but without the Dao, achievements cannot be realized. When the rulers and ministers of Tang and Yu aligned in the Dao, transformation was perfected and teaching spread; the hundred officials were upright, and the myriad people submitted—this is why the sage serves as teacher for a hundred generations. The people’s transformation by their superiors does not follow their words but follows their conduct.\n\nThus, when a ruler favors courage, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many calamities, and its gradual decline will inevitably lead to the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into darkness and disorder, and its accumulation will reach the disaster of debauchery and dissipation. Therefore, the sage’s sincerity is distinguished within, and his likes and dislikes are clear without; his words match his feelings, and his commands clarify his intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to suppress villainy—only spiritual transformation is precious. Utmost essence is spirit, and where essence moves, it is like the spring’s vitality or the autumn’s withering.\n\nThus, the noble person is like an archer: what is a hair’s breadth here is a fathom’s length there. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them. When the standard is upright, its shadow is straight; when the source is clear, its flow is long—this is the Dao of mutual support between root and branch. Knowing the heart as the root of the body, one knows the ruler as the root of the people. Thus, a ruler’s preferences must not be unprincipled. Favoring courage gives rise to the chaos of robbery and murder; favoring beauty gives rise to the disaster of debauchery and dissipation. Only one who favors virtue distinguishes essence within and clarifies likes and dislikes without. Punishments go unused, yet villainy submits; with the root and foundation secure, the state naturally attains peace.\n\nLaozi said: \"When laws are displayed and rewards are set but cannot shift customs, it is because sincerity is not embraced.\" Thus, hearing its tone, one knows its customs; observing its music, one knows its mores; seeing its mores, one knows its transformation. Those who embrace truth and manifest sincerity move heaven and earth, and their spirit transcends all bounds. Commands are obeyed, and prohibitions are upheld; their Dao is penetrated, and their intent is conveyed. Though they utter not a word, the myriad people of the world, along with birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits, transform with them. Thus, the highest is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent.\n\nA mountain glows when it contains jade; a deep pool charms when it holds pearls—what is within manifests without. Water and stone are wordless, yet people trust them. When a state cherishes its benevolence and sincerity, extends its trustworthiness, punishes without resentment, and rewards without partiality, there is no need to display laws or set rewards, for the people will transform of their own accord. Thus, those who hear of Boyi’s virtue find the stubborn become incorruptible and the weak gain resolve—what words did Boyi speak? His person transformed them.\n\nIf words are spoken but not practiced, the people will not follow.\n\nLaozi said: The Great Dao is non-action; non-action means non-possession, and non-possession means non-abiding. One who does not abide dwells in formlessness; one who is formless does not move; one who does not move does not speak. Without speech, there is stillness—soundless and formless. Soundless, it cannot be seen; formless, it cannot be heard. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the supremely spiritual. Vast and unceasing, it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Dao is formless and soundless, so the sage forces it into form, naming the Dao of Heaven and Earth with a single word. The great takes the small as its foundation; the many takes the few as its beginning. The Son of Heaven regards Heaven and Earth as his standard and all things as his resources. His merit and virtue are supreme, his power and renown most noble. The beauty of these two virtues matches Heaven and Earth, so he must follow the Great Dao as the mother of all under Heaven.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great ones: the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and the King. The Dao is non-action, thus enduring; Heaven is wordless, thus lofty and bright; Earth is soundless, thus vast and deep. To embody all three is to be a king. The king is the child of Heaven, the master of Earth, and the parent of the people. Only by lovingly nurturing all things without claiming it as favor does his merit and virtue become supreme, his power and renown most noble—none can surpass him.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving the poor and aiding the distressed gives rise to fame and profit; eliminating harm brings merit to completion. If the world is free from disasters, even sages have no virtue to display; if superiors and inferiors are harmonious, even the worthy have no merit to establish. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue and holds to the Dao, extending sincerity and delighting in giving. With boundless wisdom, he rests in silence and does not speak, yet none under Heaven fail to value his wordlessness.\n\nThus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\" What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and transmitted to others—these are but its coarse aspects. The Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings differed in their affairs but shared the same heart; they took different paths but reached the same destination. Scholars of later ages, not knowing the unity of the Dao’s embodiment or the essentials of virtue, seize upon the traces of accomplished deeds, kneel and sit to discourse upon them. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid confusion.\n\nEmbracing the Dao and holding to virtue, extending sincerity and delighting in giving—this is the Way of those above. Relieving the poor, aiding the distressed, generating profit, and eliminating harm—this is the Way of those in the middle. Seeking victory for oneself without contending for it—this is the Way of those below. Adapting to the times, understanding change and contingency, not bound by office or reclusion, differing in affairs yet sharing the same merit—such a one need not rely on bamboo, silk, metal, or stone to stand as a peer of the ancients.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can spiritually transform but cannot be spoken of. The sage governs all under Heaven without leaving his seat, his care more urgent than a cry for help. Thus, when words are the same, trust precedes them; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond them. When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit, for emotion precedes them. If he acts above but there is no response below, it is because emotion and command differ.\n\nA three-month-old infant knows not benefit or harm, yet a loving mother’s care for it grows ever deeper—this is emotion. Thus, the function of speech brings change, but the change is small; the function of silence brings change, and the change is great. Trusting a noble person’s words and being loyal to his intent, loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism. Is the ruler not the heart of Heaven and Earth? The heart is the dwelling of spirit and brightness; emotion stirs within, and words issue forth. If good, a response comes from a thousand *li* away; if not good, opposition arises from a thousand *li* away. Thus, when the sage is above, his transformation is like spirit—he governs all under Heaven without leaving his seat.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—this is not seeking fame by dying, but because a heart of affection is hidden within and does not shirk difficulty. The sorrow of the noble person is not for outward show but arises from within; it is also observed in his conduct. The sage is not ashamed before his shadow; the noble person is cautious in solitude. To abandon the near and seek the distant is to block the way.\n\nThus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance—such were the Two Emperors and Three Kings. When the sage is below, the people long for his intent—such were the mysterious sages and unadorned kings. The people do not forget their desire to benefit others. When a scholar faces danger and offers his life, or stands firm in great integrity and cannot be swayed, it is loyalty and filial piety that make it so.\n\nLike Chang Hong dying for his lord or Shen Sheng dying for his father, a heart of affection is hidden within and does not shirk difficulty—how could this be seeking fame by dying? When the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, they long for his intent.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior cries out, the three armies all retreat—this comes from the sincerity of his utterance. If one sings and none respond, or speaks and none bear it, there must be discord within. To govern all under Heaven without leaving one’s seat is to seek it within oneself. Thus, where persuasion does not reach, bearing does; where bearing does not reach, subtle influence does. Influence arises from the heart and takes form; the utmost essence can be met in form but cannot be awaited in expectation.\n\nWords issue from the mouth, actions arise from the heart—this is the movement of sincerity. Words come from near, actions extend afar—this is the response of sincerity. When a brave warrior cries out, does any in the three armies not retreat? It is the sincerity of his utterance. Like Sunzi’s teaching of warfare, courage arises from sincerity. When he beheaded the king’s beloved concubine, it was because the King of Wu’s words lacked sincerity, and disaster befell his subordinates. For those who hold a state, can their words and deeds not be sincere?\n\nLaozi said: Words have their source, affairs have their root. Losing their source and root, even with many skills, is not as good as speaking little. To harm the multitude, have the master craftsman cut off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced.\n\nThus, the wise craftsman does not rely on skill but on timely closure—yet if he does not know when to close, he must bar the door before opening it. Loquacity and busyness are what the sage warns against. Only by honoring the Dao’s root and virtue’s foundation, teaching through action rather than words, can one avoid failure. Handling affairs with non-action ensures no harm. Those swept along by vulgar trends, though skilled in many arts, are enslaved by their own cleverness—how can they not injure their hands? The great craftsman’s work does not depend on cunning; thus, no bolt or bar can keep it shut. Yet one who bars the door before opening it—though the lock be sturdy—will have it sprung when thieves arrive. Where, then, lies the root and foundation?\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings, though pursued by different paths, converge in the same end. Survival and ruin, stability and collapse, are as one to him, for his resolve never wavers from benefiting others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the laments of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all convey sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy, weeping the expression of grief—what stirs within emerges without. It is the impulse that moves them. The sage’s heart, day and night, never forgets its desire to benefit others; the reach of his grace extends far indeed.\n\nThe sage is not without desire—he follows what benefits and thereby benefits; the sage is not without action—he acts when it is fitting to act. Different paths, same destination; survival and ruin as one. Diminishing oneself to profit others, never forgetting the world. Though lands differ and customs shift, though speech varies and winds change, human nature remains constant. What stirs within emerges without: joy finds voice in song, sorrow in tears, each response arising from its cause. All are our people—how can they be forgotten? Like the Duke of Zhou, who toiled day and night, sitting vigil until dawn, his resolve unwavering—his grace extended far.\n\nLaozi said: When man governs through non-action, to act is to harm the governance of non-action. To practice non-action is to act without acting; one who cannot act without acting cannot act at all. When man is silent, the spirit speaks—yet to force silence harms the spirit’s silence. To bear silence is to injure the spirit’s numinosity. The body has form; the spirit is formless. Form speaks; the formless is silent. Knowing the mutual arising of being and non-being, the formless does not harm being, nor does being harm the formless. Thus, the sage governs through non-action, neither body harming spirit nor spirit harming body. For wisdom is not numinous—it is what makes the numinous numinous. Thus, the two do not harm each other.\n\nWenzi said: Reputation can be forcibly established, merit forcibly achieved. Once, Nanrong Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Dao had perished in himself alone. He journeyed south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit awakened, his obstructions dissolved, and though he endured hardship for ten days without eating, it was as though he feasted on the finest meats. Thereby, his clarity illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages, his wisdom spanned heaven and earth, his discernment pierced the finest detail. His praises resounded in elegant speech, ceaseless even now—this is what it means to forcibly establish a name.\n\nThus, the farmer who does not strive will not fill his granary; the official who does not exert himself will not refine his sincerity; the general and minister who do not press forward will not accomplish great deeds; the king and lord who grow lax will leave no name to posterity.\n\nThe Perfected One moves in concealment, like thunder hidden away. He acts in accord with the times, establishes merit through available resources, advances and retreats without difficulty, and penetrates all things without obstruction. Through persistent effort and resolute action, success is achieved as one—was Nanrong Zhao not also one who studied knowing the benefit of action?\n\nNanrong Chu felt shame that the sagely Way was absent within himself alone, so he entrusted his studies to the gate of Gengsang Chu. Later, he journeyed south to see Laozi and obtained the *Scripture of Nurturing Life*. His clarity illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages—thus, a name can be forcibly established, and merit can be forcibly accomplished.\n\nThe sage moves in concealment, acts in accord with the times, and establishes merit through available resources—how could advance and retreat pose any difficulty? The Perfected One refines sincerity within to manifest it outwardly, and his virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices yet does not forget harm; seeing harm, he is startled as if in mourning.\n\nHe who shares the people’s sorrows, the people will share his sorrows; he who delights in the people’s joy, the people will delight in his joy. Thus, to sorrow with the world and rejoice with the world—yet fail to become king—has never been known.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be attained. He abides in an unshakable position, accumulates in an inexhaustible storehouse, and bears his charge in an unfailing treasury. His decrees issue forth like the source of flowing water, guiding the people to offices free of contention and opening gates that must be entered.\n\nHe does not attempt what cannot be accomplished, does not seek what cannot be obtained, does not dwell where he cannot remain, and does not act where he cannot return. The great man enacts governance that brings delight, and none fail to follow his commands. When commands are followed, one progresses from the small to the great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm, and success becomes failure.\n\nThe Perfected One, the sage, and the great man should be distinguished. The Perfected One regards the people as himself, sharing in their benefit and harm. When the people rejoice, he rejoices; when the people sorrow, he sorrows—there has never been one who did not become king.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be attained; now it issues forth like a flowing stream. The great man enacts governance that brings delight, issuing commands in accord with the times. When commands align, the people follow; when they oppose, the people suffer harm.\n\nThe so-called great man is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—his inner strength like heaven and earth, his outer radiance like the sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all without exception; the sun and moon illuminate all without fail. The great man reveals goodness to others without altering his fundamental nature or changing his constant principles. The world obeys his commands as grass bends to the wind.\n\nWhen governance falters in spring, Jupiter’s movements expand or contract, no longer abiding in its proper course. When governance falters in summer, Mars retrogrades. When governance falters in autumn, Venus does not appear where it should, its rising and setting erratic. When governance falters in winter, Mercury fails to manifest in its proper region. When governance falters in all four seasons, Saturn sways and trembles, the sun and moon display omens, the five planets move in rebellion, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish; when summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season; when autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; when winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and security.\n\nHumans receive the numinous essence of heaven and earth, and the heart is the abode of spirit and illumination. The great man, however, possesses a spirit even more numinous than others. The slightest movement of his mind—whether toward good or evil—is mirrored by the celestial bell. Thus, the success or failure of governance manifests in portents and omens, responding to affairs without error.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* states: “To slight the spirits and oppress the people—August Heaven will not protect such.” Those who hold office—can they not be cautious?\n\n*Comprehensive Meaning of the* Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, *Scroll Two* (concluded)\n\n*Comprehensive Meaning of the* Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, *Scroll Three*\nCompiled by Du Daojian of Nangu Valley\n\n**The Nine Guardians**\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one, silent and limpid. The heavy and turbid became earth; the refined and subtle became heaven. They separated into the four seasons, divided into yin and yang. Pure qi formed humans; coarse qi formed creatures. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born.\n\nSpirit originates from heaven; bones and flesh are rooted in earth. When spirit enters its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? Thus, the sage models himself on heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, unenticed by others. He takes heaven as father, earth as mother, yin and yang as his warp, the four seasons as his weft. Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. All things that oppose them perish; those that accord with them live.\n\nThus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are where the Dao resides. Spirit is what one receives from heaven and earth; bones and flesh are what one is endowed with from earth.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony.\n\nThe One is the beginning of form; nine is the completion of numbers. Nine is the ultimate. The sage investigates the nine yet guards the One—then the Dao is within me. The One is the heart; the heart is heaven; heaven is man; man is things; things are the Dao; the Dao is I; I am the beginning. To know the ancient beginning—this is called the discipline of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Humans are born through the transformations of heaven and earth. In the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood and vessels form; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones harden; in the seventh, the body is complete; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera become distinct. The liver governs the eyes; the lungs govern the nose; the spleen governs the tongue; the kidneys govern the ears; the gallbladder governs the mouth. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, following heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth.\n\nHeaven has the four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder corresponds to clouds; the lungs to qi; the spleen to wind; the kidneys to rain; the liver to thunder. Humans resemble heaven and earth, and the heart governs them all. The ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon lose their course, they dim and eclipse; when wind and rain come unseasonably, they destroy and bring disaster. When the five stars lose their course, states and lands suffer calamity.\n\nThe beginning of things lies in the One, from which all arises. Through transformation, the myriad things are born. Father heaven and mother earth, yin and yang unite, conceiving and nurturing life. Impure qi forms creatures; pure qi forms humans. Thus, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all contained within my body.\n\nOpening and closing, giving and taking—such is the Way of heaven. To oppose it is to die; to follow it is to live. The Way of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still moderates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and illumination. How then can human ears and eyes endure constant stimulation without rest? How can spirit gallop without exhaustion? Thus, the sage guards the inner and does not lose the outer.\n\nBlood and qi are the glory of humans; the five viscera are their essence. When blood and qi concentrate within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, hearing and vision sharp—this is called illumination. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart, qi and intent prevail, conduct is upright, spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. Thus, one hears all, sees all, accomplishes all, and no misfortune or calamity can enter, nor can evil qi assail.\n\nTherefore, those who seek much gain little; those who see broadly know little. Heaven’s creation of things: what does not move grows like a plant; what moves crawls horizontally; what is planted stands upright. Humans combine the functions of both movement and stillness—thus they are more numinous than the myriad things. The four limbs, the hundred parts, spirit, blood, and qi—how can one not cherish them? How can one seek excessively?\n\nKings, dukes, and great officials, entrusted with the world, must also encompass humanity and all things, loving and nurturing them as they do their own bodies—only then is the Dao fulfilled. The orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Thus, when the ears and eyes indulge in sounds and sights, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not rest, spirit gallops and does not guard. Though fortune and misfortune come like mountains, one cannot recognize them.\n\nThus, the sage cherishes without excess. If the sage’s ears, eyes, and spirit are profoundly penetrating, unenticed by external allure, and if his intent and qi do not lose their clarity, with few desires, the five viscera are at peace. When spirit guards within and does not stray from the body, one can observe beyond past ages, within future affairs, and between fortune and misfortune—all becomes clearly visible. Therefore, the farther one strays, the less one knows. This is to say that spirit must not be allowed to indulge externally.\n\nThus, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, making them dull; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores; preferences and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Desires make human qi excessive; likes and dislikes exhaust human essence. If one does not swiftly cast them aside, intent and qi will daily diminish. Though the Yellow River is vast, wind and sun deplete it. Though spirit may be sovereign, worldly desires disturb it.\n\nNothing escapes this diminishing. The sage, profoundly penetrating, is free from allure and longing. Spirit is firmly secured within, while the body remains at ease externally. The chamber of the heart is empty and void, and the numinous comes to dwell therein. Beyond past ages and before future affairs, nothing is not illuminated—all due to the heart’s emptiness.\n\nThe Way of nurturing life is no other than this: its method is like tending a horse—simply remove what harms it. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is their excessive indulgence in the pursuit of life. Only one who takes no thought for life thereby attains long life.\n\nHeaven and earth move in mutual resonance; the myriad things are gathered into one. To know the One is to know all things; to fail to know the One is to know nothing. I dwell in the world as but one thing among things—yet things are also things. How can one thing assess another?\n\nThe desire for life cannot be served; the aversion to death cannot be refused. To despise lowliness cannot be hated; to delight in honor cannot be rejoiced. Following one’s endowment and settling into stillness, daring not to go to extremes—daring not to go to extremes, one reaches the utmost joy.\n\nSome things arise without being made, sought, or nurtured—this is Heaven. Those that must be made, sought, and nurtured belong to man. If man errs by harboring the intent to make or seek, it is like forcing the sprouts to grow, only to bring harm, injuring life and losing nurture, failing to fulfill the natural lifespan.\n\nThe sage, resonant with Heaven and earth, is one with things. He does not augment life nor reject death; he scorns lowliness yet does not hate it, honors nobility yet does not rejoice. Following his endowment and settling into stillness, daring not to go to extremes, he reaches the utmost joy.\n\n**Guarding Emptiness**\nLaozi said: The so-called sage adapts to the times and rests content in his place, engaging with the world and delighting in his work. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; delight and anger are excesses of the Dao. In life, he moves with Heaven’s course; in death, he transforms with things. At rest, he harmonizes with yin’s power; in motion, he flows with yang’s current. Thus, the heart is the master of the body, and spirit is the heart’s treasure. If the body labors without rest, it withers; if essence is expended without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage follows this without daring to transgress.\n\nResponding to being with non-being, he exhausts its principles; receiving the full with the empty, he fathoms its limits. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, he fulfills his destiny. Neither distant nor close, he embraces virtue and kindles harmony, aligning with Heaven. He borders the Dao and neighbors virtue, neither initiating fortune nor preceding misfortune. Death and life bring no change to him—this is called utmost spirit. With spirit, one seeks and obtains all, accomplishes all. The sage empties himself to wander the world, moves with Heaven, and acts in accord with the times. Neither profit nor harm sways his heart; neither death nor life alters him. Receiving the full with the empty, he embraces virtue and kindles harmony. Misfortune does not precede him; fortune does not initiate with him. When affairs arise, he responds like an echo—divinely. When the response ceases, he is still. This is called guarding emptiness.\n\n**Guarding the Undivided**\nLaozi said: To regard the world as light is to keep spirit unburdened; to see the myriad things as minute is to keep the heart unconfused. To equalize life and death is to keep the will unafraid; to harmonize with change is to keep names from dazzling. The perfected man leans on an unshakable pillar, walks an unobstructed path, draws from an inexhaustible store, and learns from an undying teacher. Wherever he goes, he succeeds; wherever he turns, he penetrates. Whether bending or stretching, bowing or rising, he holds fast to destiny without confusion, turning through fortune and misfortune. Profit and harm cannot trouble his heart.\n\nOne who acts with righteousness may be pressed with benevolence but cannot be coerced with arms; he may be guided with righteousness but cannot be lured with profit. The noble man dies for righteousness—he cannot be detained by wealth or honor. He acts for righteousness and cannot be frightened by death—how much more so for one who practices non-action? One who practices non-action is without burden. The unburdened man takes the world as his shadow and pillar. Looking up to the ranks of the perfected, deeply probing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining the conduct of the vulgar below—this is truly shameful.\n\nOne who takes no thought for the world is like striking a drum to summon learning. Non-being gives rise to being, yet being is not without non-being. When being perishes, it returns to non-being. Being cannot exist without non-being; non-being is the root of being, yet being cannot sustain itself. To know the benefit of non-being and the use of being is to know that non-being is not nothingness—where nothingness is not nothing, there is the Dao. Being does not endure forever; what does not endure forever is a thing. Thus, the sage is rich without possessing, poor without lacking. Equalizing self and others, unifying life and death, he is not burdened in spirit. What does not perish in the self resides here—this is called guarding the undivided.\n\n**Guarding Equanimity**\nLaozi said: Esteem and wealth are what men covet, yet compared to the body, they are base. Therefore, the sage eats enough to fill the belly and replenish qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold. He satisfies his nature and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundance. His eyes do not gaze, his ears do not listen, his mouth does not speak, his heart does not scheme. He discards cleverness and returns to simplicity, rests his spirit, and abandons cunning. Without preferences or aversions, this is called great penetration.\n\nTo remove filth and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from the source. What could then not be accomplished? One who knows the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured by profit; one who unites inner and outer signs cannot be tempted by power. The outer limit of the outer is vast; the inner limit of the inner is most noble. To know the great and noble—where could one not succeed?\n\nThe Dao values guarding; with guarding, there is accomplishment. The heart values equanimity; with equanimity, there is no tilting. The world’s esteem and wealth are what all men covet. Covetousness gives rise to an unbalanced heart—this is not the Way of guarding. Thus, the sage eats to fill his belly, wears enough to cover his body, and harbors no greed for excess accumulation.\n\nThus, with a heart at peace and qi settled, the spirit does not stray outward—this accords with the great constancy of the Dao and is called \"guarding equilibrium.\"\n\n**Guarding the Easy (4)**\nLaozi said: Those of old who embodied the Dao ordered their emotions and nature, cultivated their heart’s arts, nurtured them with harmony, and maintained them with moderation. They delighted in the Dao and forgot lowliness; their inner power was secure, and they forgot poverty. If nature has no desires, there is nothing unattainable through desirelessness; if the heart has no joys, there is nothing unachievable through joylessness. What harms nature is not allowed to burden virtue; what disrupts life is not permitted to disturb harmony. They did not indulge the body or follow whim, yet their institutions could serve as models for the world. They ate according to their stomach’s measure, clothed themselves according to their form’s needs, dwelled where their body fit, and acted according to their nature’s inclination. They left the world’s surplus without claiming it and entrusted the myriad things without seeking profit—how could poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness cause them to lose their nature and life? Those who do so may be said to have embodied the Dao.\n\n\"Much ease brings many difficulties\"—this speaks of affairs. But in terms of the Dao, it is not so. Those of old who embodied the Dao cultivated their heart and nature, made their bodies at ease before acting, settled their intentions before moving, delighted in the Dao and rested in constancy, and did not attempt what was difficult or extraordinary. Thus, their institutions had laws, their bearing was observable, and they acted with composure—this is called \"guarding the easy.\"\n\n**Guarding Purity (5)**\nLaozi said: Humans receive qi from Heaven, and their ears and eyes respond to sounds and sights, their nose and mouth to fragrances and odors, their hungry skin to cold and warmth—all share the same nature. Yet some die, some live; some become noble, some base. The difference lies in how they are governed.\n\nThe spirit is the wellspring of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is at peace. No one mirrors themselves in flowing water but in still water, for it is clear and tranquil. Thus, when the spirit is clear and the intent is calm, one can perceive the true nature of things. Those who employ this must borrow from non-employment. A bright mirror is not sullied by dust and grime; a clear spirit is not misled by cravings. Wherever the heart reaches, the spirit is luminously present; returning to emptiness, agitation dissipates and rest is stored—this is the wandering of the sage.\n\nThus, those who govern the world must first comprehend the nature of life and destiny. Water is clear and mirrors things; the spirit is clear and perceives the Dao. Humans receive qi from Heaven in the same way, so why should my perception of the Dao in the heart be uniquely different? Because the heart is clear. The sage’s heart is bright as still water: when things come, they are seen; when they depart, it returns to stillness—how could anything linger in my heart? A clear mirror is unperturbed—this is called \"guarding purity.\"\n\n**Guarding Authenticity (6)**\nLaozi said: The so-called sage simply accords with nature: eating according to the stomach’s measure, clothing according to the body’s form, restraining the self so that greedy and corrupt thoughts have no way to arise. Thus, those who can possess the world must not treat the world as their possession; those who can attain fame and reputation must not seek it through transgressive conduct. Truly comprehending the nature of life and destiny, benevolence and righteousness naturally adhere.\n\nIf the spirit is unobscured and the heart unburdened, all is penetrating and unimpeded, serene and untroubled—power and profit cannot lure, sounds and sights cannot seduce, eloquence cannot persuade, cunning cannot move, and bravery cannot frighten. This is the wandering of the true person. Those who give life do not live; those who transform do not change. Those who do not grasp this Dao, though their wisdom governs heaven and earth, their brilliance illuminates the sun and moon, their eloquence unravels linked rings, and their words moisten metal and stone, are still of no benefit in governing the world. Thus, the sage does not lose what they guard.\n\nThe sage follows nature, guards utmost authenticity, aligns with the times, and understands the hearts of the people. Only by not opposing the nature of the myriad things can the heart congeal and the form dissolve, becoming pure and unceasing—this is called \"guarding authenticity.\"\n\n**Guarding Stillness (7)**\nLaozi said: Stillness, silence, tranquility, and simplicity nurture life; harmony, joy, emptiness, and nothingness uphold virtue. When the outer does not disturb the inner, nature attains its proper place; when stillness is unmoving and harmony is settled, virtue rests in its position. Nurturing life to order the world and embracing virtue to live out one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.\n\nThose who do so have unobstructed blood and qi, no stagnant qi in the five viscera, and are neither warped by fortune nor sullied by fame or blame. Without possessing the world, who could aid them? Having talent but not meeting the times, one cannot even free oneself—how much less without the Dao?\n\nThose who see the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; those who tune their ears to the sounds of gold and jade cannot see the shape of Mount Tai. Thus, a small focus causes one to forget the great. Now, when the myriad things come, they snatch at our nature and seize our essence like a spring’s source—though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?\n\nIf a basin of water is clear, one can see their eyebrows after a day; if it is muddied by a single stir, one cannot discern its shape. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy, like a basin of water. The Dao of heaven and earth is still, so things grow without being forced; the sage’s governance is still, so the people are naturally capable. If one harbors a mind to seek merit and stir up affairs, disturbing nature and disordering heaven’s constancy, stillness is lost and movement is confused.\n\nOnly by not pursuing strange changes is this called \"guarding stillness.\"\n\n**Guarding the Law (8)**\nLaozi said: The highest sage models Heaven; the next esteems worthies; the lowest employs ministers. Employing ministers is the path to peril and ruin; esteeming worthies is the source of delusion and confusion; modeling Heaven is the Dao of governing heaven and earth.\n\nEmptiness and stillness are the foundation: emptiness receives all, stillness sustains all. Knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness, one can endure from beginning to end. Thus, the sage takes stillness as governance and movement as disorder. Therefore it is said: Do not disturb or agitate, and the myriad things will clarify themselves; do not startle or alarm, and the myriad things will order themselves—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe highest sage models Heaven, and the hundred bones are ordered, the myriad transformations at peace. The next esteems worthies, and the law proceeds from the self—this is the source of delusion. The lowest employs ministers, and the law emerges from the mouths of the many—this is the omen of peril and ruin. Cultivating the self without the Dao is to be deluded in affairs and lose one’s spirit; governing the state without the Dao is to disorder policy and harm the people. Only taking the embodiment of the Dao as the foundation is this called \"guarding the Law.\"\n\n**Guarding Weakness (9)**\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world or the state as their household, regard the myriad things as their livestock, embrace the vastness of all under Heaven, and possess the abundance of the ten thousand things. Yet when their qi is replete and their ambitions arrogant, the great use troops to invade the small, the small grow insolent and overbear their superiors, and their hearts indulge in extravagance and excess—this is like whirlwinds and violent rains, which cannot endure for long. Therefore the sage governs with the Dao, holds to the One and practices non-action, without harming the primal qi. Perceiving the small and guarding softness, withdrawing and possessing nothing, modeling the rivers and seas, the rivers and seas do not act—thus merit and fame transform themselves. Not forcing, one can complete one’s kingship; acting as the female of all under Heaven, one’s spirit does not die. Self-cherishing completes one’s nobility. With the power of ten thousand chariots and the ten thousand things as one’s merit and fame, the burden of authority is most weighty—one cannot treat oneself lightly. Treating oneself lightly, merit and fame will not be achieved.\n\nThe Dao is great yet accomplished through the small, abundant yet ruled by the few. Thus the sage governs all under Heaven with the Dao. That which is soft, weak, subtle, and mysterious perceives the small; that which is frugal, sparing, diminished, and deficient perceives the few. Perceiving the small, one can complete the great; perceiving the few, one can complete the beautiful. Weakness is the function of the Dao, not cowardice—it is but guarding the harmonious and balanced. The Son of Heaven takes all under Heaven as his household; the feudal lords take their states as their households. Regarding the people as oneself, not relying on power and position to assert strength, not using arms to oppress the multitude—if distant peoples do not submit, then cultivate civil virtue to attract them. Great resources complete the small and become abundant; supporting the few as the foundation, advancing without harm, one attains peace and tranquility—this is called \"guarding weakness.\"\n\nThe Way of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low, diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency. The rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus all under Heaven returns to and serves them. Therefore the sage, humble, modest, pure, and yielding, perceives lowness; emptying the heart of all, perceives insufficiency. Perceiving lowness, one can attain loftiness; perceiving insufficiency, one can complete one’s worthiness. Those who are haughty do not stand; those who are extravagant do not endure; the strong and overbearing perish; the overflowing and full are ruined. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last the day; small valleys cannot remain full for even a moment. Whirlwinds and torrential rains carry the qi of strength and overbearing, thus they cannot last and perish; small valleys occupy the place of strength and overbearing, thus they cannot but be seized.\n\nTherefore the sage holds to the female and the yielding, abandons arrogance and extravagance, and dares not act with the qi of strength and overbearing. Holding to the female and the yielding, one can establish one’s maleness and virility; not daring arrogance and extravagance, one can endure long. The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency, detests fullness and favors modesty. Those who rely on force become hegemons; those who rely on virtue become kings. The weak overcomes the strong.\n\nWhen people impose harsh governance and oppress the people, it is like Heaven’s violent winds breaking trees—primordial qi vents its wrath, and strength cannot endure long. Thus the sage is humble and lowly, guarding only weakness.\n\nLaozi said: The Way of Heaven reaches its extreme and then reverses; when full, it diminishes—this is seen in the sun and moon. Therefore the sage daily diminishes, and the primal qi does not dare become full; daily advancing with the female, his merit and power do not decline—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nHuman nature and emotions all favor the high and detest the low, favor gain and detest loss, favor profit and detest harm, favor honor and detest humility, favor nobility and detest baseness. The multitude acts accordingly, thus cannot succeed; clinging to these, thus cannot attain. Therefore the sage models Heaven: not acting yet accomplishing, not grasping yet attaining. Sharing human emotions yet following a different path, he can endure long.\n\nThus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called the *yòuzhī*. When empty, it stands upright; when full, it overturns. Things flourish and then decline; the sun at its zenith moves on; the moon at its full wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Therefore, those with keen hearing and broad wisdom guard with foolishness; those with extensive learning and eloquence guard with restraint; those with martial strength and courage guard with awe; those with wealth and vastness guard with narrowness; those whose virtue extends to all under Heaven guard with yielding. These five are how the former kings guarded all under Heaven. Those who follow this Dao do not desire fullness, thus can wear out without renewal.\n\nThe Dao reaches its extreme and then reverses; things flourish and then decline—this is the constant principle. The *zhī* vessel full then overturns; the blade hard then snaps—this is the constant of things. If one can observe the constant principles of things and not rely on power to oppress the multitude and assert strength, then one avoids the harm of stumbling and falling. Preserving softness and weakness, one can endure long.\n\nLaozi said: The sage closes with yin and opens with yang, able to reach the state of no joy—thus there is nothing not joyful. Being without anything not joyful is to reach ultimate joy. Therefore, inner joy is external, not external joy within. Thus there is self-joy, and having this attainment, one is honored throughout all under Heaven. The reason for this is taking all under Heaven as the essential for all under Heaven, not residing in that, but in the self; not in others, but in one’s own person. When the person attains, the ten thousand things are complete.\n\nThus one who has mastered the discourse on the arts of the heart is external to desires, likes, and aversions. Therefore, there is nothing to delight in, nothing to anger, nothing to rejoice in, nothing to suffer. The myriad things are profoundly united, without right or wrong. Thus the scholar has a constant discourse; the woman has unchanging conduct. Not relying on power to be honored, not needing wealth to be rich, not requiring force to be strong, not valuing goods and wealth, not coveting worldly fame, not taking nobility as security, not taking baseness as peril—form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place.\n\nWhen Heaven is about to rain, the pillars’ bases first moisten...\n\nWhen spring is near, the ice thaws first; when a man is about to die, his tongue stiffens first—qi effects this. The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death. Those who are violent and unyielding yet do not meet their end are the most extreme of the violent and unyielding. Only when qi and form are harmonious and weak, merging with things in profound unity and growing together without harm, does one approach the Way.\n\nThe form is the dwelling of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the regulator of life. If any one of these loses its proper place, all three are injured. Thus, when spirit presides, form follows and benefits; when form presides, spirit follows and suffers. The greedy and covetous, blinded by power and profit, lured by fame and rank, strive with excessive cunning to rise above others in the world. Their essence and spirit daily wane and drift far away; long immersed and unable to return, their form becomes closed and resistant, leaving no path for entry. Thus they often suffer blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nEssence, spirit, will, and qi—when still, they daily grow and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Therefore, the sage nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and softens their qi, levels their form, and drifts with the Dao. In this way, the transformations of the myriad things all find their counterpart, and the changes of a hundred affairs all meet their response.\n\nSpirit depends on form to live; essence depends on qi to flourish. Nurturing one another without losing harmony—this is the essence of cultivating life. But those who are empty and arrogant, relying on qi to contend with things, will deplete their essence and exhaust their spirit, often suffering blindness and forgetfulness—signs of approaching death.\n\nThus the sage weakens their form, harmonizes their qi, and conceals their spirit, attaining the Way of the Nine Guardians. Does the sage deceive us? To aspire to sagehood is to become a sage; to aspire to worthiness is to become worthy.\n\nIn guarding simplicity, Laozi said: The so-called True Person is one whose nature aligns with the Dao. Thus, they have yet seem without; are full yet seem empty. They govern their inner self, not their outer self, clarifying the Great Simplicity. They act without contrivance and return to simplicity, embracing their origin and holding fast to spirit, roaming the root of Heaven and Earth. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action, they carry no schemes or cunning in their hearts. Discerning the unborrowed, they do not shift with things. Perceiving the transformations of affairs, they hold to their source. Their mind and intent focus inward, comprehending fortune and misfortune as one. Abiding without knowing what they do, moving without knowing where they go, they know without learning, see without looking, accomplish without acting, and distinguish without governing.\n\nThey respond to stimuli, move under compulsion, and go when there is no choice—like light fearing darkness, like a shadow following form. Following the Dao as their guide, they act when conditions are met. Vast and empty, clear and still, they take the thousand lives as one transformation, the ten thousand differences as one source. They possess essence yet do not employ it; possess spirit yet do not use it. They guard the simplicity of the Great Undifferentiated, standing at the center of utmost purity. Their sleep is dreamless, their wisdom unaroused. In movement, they leave no form; in stillness, no substance. Existing yet seeming absent, living yet seeming dead, they enter and exit without gap, commanding ghosts and spirits.\n\nThis is how essence and spirit ascend to the Dao: by ensuring their free flow without losing their origin, day and night without interruption, harmonizing with things like spring. This is to unite and give birth to the seasons within the heart. Thus, though the form may decay, the spirit never transforms. Responding to change without changing, through a thousand shifts and ten thousand turns, it remains without limit. The changing return to formlessness; the unchanging are born with Heaven and Earth. Therefore, that which gives life has never truly lived; what it gives life to is but life’s transformation. The transforming has never truly transformed; what it transforms is but transformation.\n\nThis is the wandering of the True Person, the pure Dao. The True Person guards the simplicity of the Great Undifferentiated, roams the root of Heaven and Earth, and merges with the Great Thoroughfare—vast and without trace. Only by not possessing a self do they not lack things. They laugh when others laugh, weep when others weep, yet through a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they never reach an end. The changing return to formlessness, yet there is change without change. The unchanging are born with Heaven and Earth, yet there is life without life.\n\nThe Nine Guardians of before and the guarding of simplicity that follows—these are one becoming nine, and ten returning to one. This is called roaming with the Creator. *The Thoroughly Illuminated True Classic, with Collected Explanations, Scroll Three* ends here.\n\n**Scroll Four of *The Thoroughly Illuminated True Classic, with Collected Explanations*\nCompiled by Nan’guzi Du Daojian**\n\n**The Chapter of Tally-Words**\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. Level as the water-level, straight as the marking-line, round as the compass, square as the carpenter’s square. It enfolds Heaven and Earth yet has no inside or outside; it penetrates and covers all yet encounters no obstruction. Thus, one who embodies the Dao is neither angered nor delighted. Seated, they are without care; asleep, they dream not. They name things as they appear and respond to affairs as they arise.\n\nTallies manifest trust; words convey sincerity. The world speaks of tally-mandates, tally-seals, golden tallies, and jade tallies—all serve to manifest trust and convey sincerity, so that this evokes and that responds. Hence, they are called *tally-words*.\n\nThe Dao is without limit in height or depth, connecting far and near. It is formless and nameless, yet possesses sentiment and trust.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao, harboring no private joy or anger. They name things as they appear and respond to affairs as they arise. Unspoken words may yet serve as tally and trust.\n\nLaozi said: Those who covet fame must create affairs. Once affairs arise, they abandon the public and pursue the private, forsake the Dao and rely on themselves. They perform good deeds for praise and establish virtue for renown. Thus, governance does not follow principle, and affairs do not accord with the times. Governance that does not follow principle invites much blame; affairs that do not accord with the times yield no merit. Acting recklessly to meet expectations, success cannot absolve their blame, while failure is enough to destroy them. Fame is the instrument of self-destruction—what the sage guards against.\n\nThose who covet fame must violate Heaven and defy the Dao, abandon the public and pursue the private, seek praise and establish renown, creating affairs to harm the multitude. Thus, governance does not follow principle, merit cannot outweigh blame, affairs fail and destroy the self—this is no falsehood.\n\nLaozi said: Be not the corpse of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of cunning. Conceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Be not the first to seek fortune, nor the initiator of misfortune. Begin in formlessness, move only when unavoidable. Desire fortune? First distance misfortune. Desire benefit? First avoid harm.\n\nThus, those who act yet seek tranquility—if they lose their tranquility, they court danger. Those who govern—if they lose their governance, they invite chaos. Therefore, desire not to be as jade, restless and polished; nor as stone, solitary and unyielding.\n\nThe finer the grain, the sooner the skin is flayed; the finer the antlers, the sooner the body is slain. Sweet springs must run dry; straight trees must be felled. Florid words later become transgressions; jade within stone harms the mountain. The calamities of the black-headed people surely precede their words.\n\nThe retribution of good and evil follows like shadow after form. Good deeds summon blessings; evil deeds summon misfortune. Evil must not be done—how then can fame be coveted?\n\nThose who seek tranquility—if tranquility is lost, danger follows. Those who seek governance—if governance is lost, chaos ensues. Fine grain invites flaying; fine antlers invite slaughter. Never has harm come that was not self-invited.\n\nLaozi said: When the times move, act in accord. Those who do not know the Dao mistake fortune for misfortune. Heaven is the canopy; Earth, the carriage-pole. Those who skillfully employ the Dao never meet their end. Earth is the carriage-wheel; Heaven, the canopy. Those who skillfully employ the Dao never suffer harm.\n\nWhen the five phases are arrayed, there must be conquest. All beneath Heaven’s cover is fitting. Thus, to know yet claim ignorance is sickness; to be ignorant yet claim knowledge is also sickness.\n\nHeaven as canopy covers all; Earth as carriage bears all. Heaven and Earth’s grace toward humanity is boundlessly great. The sage emulates this: acting in accord with the times, every movement follows. Like the five phases, they mutually generate and mutually conquer.\n\nThose who skillfully employ the Dao know without speaking of knowledge—this is superior. To be ignorant yet speak of knowledge is sickness.\n\nLaozi said: Mountains give birth to metal; stone gives birth to jade. They turn and flay one another. Trees give birth to insects, which return to devour them. Humans create affairs, which return to harm them.\n\nThose who love affairs are never without misfortune; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Skilled swimmers drown; skilled riders fall. Each suffers calamity through what they love.\n\nSuccess lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth abides below and does not contend for height—thus it is secure and never imperiled. Water flows downward and does not contend for speed—thus it departs yet is never late.\n\nTherefore, the sage, being without attachment, suffers no loss; being without action, meets no defeat. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things mutually steal to nourish one another. When theft is fitting, there is peace; when theft is unfitting, there is harm.\n\nThus, food can nourish humans, yet also harm them. The people can support their lord, yet also rebel against him. When scholars establish laws and initiate affairs to exploit the people’s strength, it may seem beneficial at first, but in the end, none do not harm themselves.\n\nKnow that success lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity—then there will be no loss from mutual theft.\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot be exhausted; two words are the ancestral teaching of the world. Three words make the lords of states mighty; four words make the world balanced.\n\nIntegrity and trust cannot be exhausted. Virtue and the Dao are the world’s ancestral teaching. Exalting the worthy and virtuous makes the lords of states mighty. Loathing the few and loving the many makes the world balanced.\n\nFew faults in speech, few regrets in conduct—this lies in action, not in words. Holding the great image, the world comes to you—this lies in virtue, not in peril.\n\nThe mouth alone gives rise to good and incites strife—how can words not be cautious?\n\nLaozi said: Humans face three deaths, none of which are fated. Immoderate eating and drinking, despising and degrading the body—illness kills them together. Insatiable in pleasure, unceasing in desire—punishment kills them together.\n\nWith few to confront the many, with weak to oppress the strong—warfare kills them together.\n\nLife must end in death; who can escape it? To die without fate is truly pitiable.\n\nGluttony and lust bring death by illness,\nGreed for gain brings death by punishment,\nTyranny brings death by war.\n\nThough these three deaths differ in cause, their lack of fate is one.\n\nLaozi said:\nTo those who give generously, their reward is splendid;\nTo those who harbor great grudges, their calamity runs deep.\nTo give little yet expect much,\nTo hoard resentment yet claim no misfortune—\nSuch things have never existed.\n\nObserve how they go, and you shall know how they came.\nThe principle of giving and receiving is like planting melons and gathering melons,\nPlanting fruit and gathering fruit.\nThe law of gratitude and resentment is the same.\n\nLaozi said:\nTo fathom Heaven’s decree,\nTo cultivate the mind’s method,\nTo regulate affection and aversion,\nTo harmonize nature and disposition—\nThen the Way of governance is complete.\n\nTo fathom Heaven’s decree is to not be perplexed by fortune and misfortune;\nTo cultivate the mind’s method is to not indulge in false joy or anger;\nTo regulate affection and aversion is to not covet what is useless;\nTo harmonize nature and disposition is to let desire not exceed proper measure.\nNot to be perplexed by fortune and misfortune means action and stillness follow natural order;\nNot to indulge in false joy or anger means rewards and punishments are impartially given;\nNot to covet what is useless means desire does not harm innate nature;\nTo let desire not exceed proper measure means nurturing life through contentment.\n\nThese four principles require no external seeking, no reliance on others—\nThey are attained by turning inward.\n\nHeaven’s decree, the mind’s method, affection and aversion, nature and disposition—\nThese four are interlinked, like the moon reflected in water,\nIts waxing and waning, roundness and absence, mirroring its form.\n\nThe rectitude or perversity of the mind’s method determines fortune and misfortune.\n\nLaozi said:\nDo not seek actions that invite censure,\nDo not resent others’ disapproval of you.\nCultivate virtue that earns praise,\nDo not seek praise for yourself.\nYou cannot ensure misfortune will not come—trust that you do not court it,\nNor can you ensure fortune will arrive—trust that you do not reject it.\nWhen misfortune comes, it is not of your making, so even in adversity, you need not grieve;\nWhen fortune arrives, it is not of your doing, so even in prosperity, you need not boast.\n\nThus, in quietude you find joy,\nIn non-action you govern.\nTrust yourself—what need for seeking?\nResent not others—what need for aversion?\nVirtue and conduct stem from yourself; praise and blame come from others.\nThus, praise does not spur you to greater effort,\nNor does criticism deter you.\nYou dwell in quietude and take joy,\nGovernance is not a burden to you.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao is to hold fast to what you already possess,\nNot to seek what you do not yet have.\nTo seek what you do not yet have is to lose what you already possess;\nTo follow what you already possess is to attain what you desire.\n\nGovernance not yet secured against disorder will inevitably falter;\nActions not yet free of fault will inevitably meet setback.\nThus, no greater fortune than avoiding misfortune,\nNo greater benefit than avoiding loss.\n\nThe Dao cannot be pursued to gain advantage,\nBut it can bring tranquility and avert harm.\nThus, one may always avoid misfortune but not always attain fortune,\nAlways avoid guilt but not always earn merit.\n\nThe Dao is vast and obscure,\nFollowing Heaven’s might,\nAligning with Heaven’s qi,\nWithout scheming or planning,\nWithout storing or hoarding.\nTo welcome without inviting,\nTo send without bidding farewell—\nThough people move east, west, south, or north,\nThey stand firm at the center.\nThus, amid crookedness, you remain straight,\nFlowing with the world yet never straying from your path.\nYou neither seek goodness nor shun ugliness,\nFollowing Heaven’s Way without initiation,\nWithout self-aggrandizement,\nFollowing Heaven’s principle without premeditation,\nWithout neglecting the times,\nAligning with Heaven’s timing,\nWithout seeking gain,\nWithout rejecting fortune,\nConforming to Heaven’s decree.\n\nWithin, no extraordinary fortune;\nWithout, no extraordinary misfortune.\nThus, misfortune and fortune do not arise,\nAnd who would dare harm others?\n\nTherefore, supreme virtue speaks of shared paths,\nActs in shared fortune,\nUnites hearts above and below,\nWith no divergent ways.\nThose with peripheral visions are dismissed from error,\nThe path to goodness is opened,\nAnd the people turn toward rectitude.\n\nGreed for gain and forgetfulness of loss—\nA common affliction among all.\nWithout desire, there is tranquility—\nThis is called the Perfect Person.\n\nIn the world, there are things that cannot be guaranteed.\nTo hold fast to what you possess may bring what you lack;\nTo seek what you lack may lose what you possess.\nThus, those who follow the Dao\nHave no extraordinary fortune within,\nNo extraordinary misfortune without,\nAnd align with Heaven—\nWho could harm them?\n\nLaozi said:\nTo do good is to encourage,\nTo do evil is to invite observation.\nEncouragement brings nobility,\nObservation brings calamity.\nThus, the Dao cannot be pursued to seek fame,\nBut it can be cultivated in retreat to refine oneself.\n\nTherefore, the sage does not seek fame through action,\nNor reputation through knowledge.\nGovernance follows naturally,\nAnd the self remains unburdened.\n\nWhat is done may fail,\nWhat is sought may not be attained,\nAnd people may falter while the Dao remains unobstructed.\n\nTo have wisdom yet do nothing is the same as having no wisdom;\nTo have ability yet act not is the same as having no ability.\nTo have wisdom as though without wisdom,\nTo have ability as though without ability—\nWhen the Dao is fully understood, human talent is extinguished.\n\nHuman understanding and the Dao cannot both flourish;\nIf people love fame, they will not use the Dao.\nWhen the Dao surpasses humanity, fame fades,\nAnd when fame flourishes, the Dao is obscured—\nThen peril and ruin follow.\n\nTo do good without seeking fortune yet fortune comes,\nTo do evil without inviting misfortune yet misfortune arises.\nTo leave a stench for ten thousand generations,\nOr a fragrant name for a thousand years—\nThe difference is clear.\n\nThus, if one values fame excessively,\nThe mind will not adhere to the Dao;\nIf one delves deeply into the Dao,\nThe body will not seek fame.\nThis is the distinction between Heaven and humanity.\n\nLaozi said:\nTo let honest men divide wealth is not as fair as\nSetting fixed portions and casting lots—\nFor those with intent in division\nAre not as impartial as those without intent.\n\nTo let virtuous men guard wealth is not as secure as\nSealing the doors and keeping it sealed—\nFor those with desire in guarding\nAre not as tranquil as those without desire.\n\nWhen others point out your flaws, resentment arises;\nWhen overseers see your ugliness, you mend your ways.\nIf one can interact with others without entangling oneself,\nThey are free from burdens.\n\nTo divide wealth by casting lots,\nIntent is less fair than disinterest;\nTo guard wealth by sealing doors,\nDesire is less secure than contentment.\n\n「To point out another’s flaws brings resentment,\nYet to love one’s own faults is unnatural.\nTo see another’s ugliness prompts self-improvement,\nYet to cherish one’s own flaws is self-deception.\nOnly those who interact with others without entangling themselves in their affairs\nHave no such faults, and others find none in them.\n\nLaozi said:\nWhen dealing with others,\nIf one does not offer treasures or wealth,\nThey will use humble words,\nYet their greed will never be sated.\nWith a humble demeanor, they avoid flattery,\nAnd their discussions and dealings remain uncorrupted.\n\nTo bind with oaths and alliances,\nYet break them before the appointed day—\nThis is why the virtuous do not outwardly display benevolence and righteousness\nWhile inwardly cultivating virtue and moral power.\nThey govern their own lands,\nExpand their territories,\nEncourage the people to defend their lives,\nStrengthen their walls and fortresses,\nAnd unite the people in heart,\nSo that together they may guard the ancestral altars and the state.\nThus, they do not punish the innocent,\nNor exploit the scarce for private gain—\nThis is the Dao of preserving completeness,\nThe principle of ensuring benefit.\n\nTo deal with others by offering treasures and wealth,\nTheir greed will never be sated.\nTo bind with humble words,\nTheir agreements will falter before the appointed day.\n\nOnly when one inwardly cultivates virtue and moral power,\nAnd unites the people in heart,\nCan they guard the ancestral altars and the state,\nAnd protect the people.\nThen their Dao is complete.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Sage does not conquer their own heart,\nWhile the common people cannot conquer their desires.\nThe virtuous follow the upright *qi*,\nThe petty follow the perverse *qi*.\nWhat aligns with nature within,\nAnd conforms to righteousness without,\nMoving according to principle without clashing with things—\nThis is the upright *qi*.\nWhat indulges in flavors and luxuries,\nRevels in sound and color,\nActs on whims and anger,\nWithout regard for future consequences—\nThis is the perverse *qi*.\nThe perverse and the upright harm each other,\nDesire and nature conflict,\nThey cannot coexist—\nOne flourishes while the other declines.\nThus, the Sage diminishes desire to follow nature.\n\nThe eyes love color,\nThe ears love sound,\nThe nose loves fragrance,\nThe mouth loves flavor—\nWhen all are indulged,\nThey cannot escape the harm of craving and desire.\nThe ears, eyes, nose, and mouth,\nIf they do not know what to desire,\nAre governed by the heart,\nEach finding its proper place.\nFrom this, it is clear that desire cannot be conquered.\n\nThe Dao-heart and the human-heart,\nThe distinction between Heaven’s principle and human desire.\nWhen principle prevails,\nAll actions are Heavenly.\nWhen desire prevails,\nAll actions are human—\nThis is the distinction between the virtuous and the petty.\n\nPrinciple and desire conquer each other,\nThe perverse and the upright harm each other—\nThe virtuous do not indulge in such,\nHow much less would the Sage?\n\nLaozi said:\nTo cultivate the body and nurture nature,\nOne must regulate sleep and rest,\nModerate food and drink,\nHarmonize joy and anger,\nBalance movement and stillness.\nWhat is gained within,\nThe perverse *qi* cannot enter.\n\nTo adorn the exterior while harming the interior,\nTo indulge emotions while damaging the spirit—\nThose who see only outward appearances\nAre blind to their true nature.\nHe who forgets his virtue for even a moment\nWill be constrained in his nature,\nHe who forgets his true nature within a hundred paces\nWill burden his form.\nThus, those with beautiful feathers\nAre wounded in their bones,\nThose with lush branches\nAre harmed at their roots.\nNone in the world can possess both beauties.\nThe true Dao nurtures the spirit,\nThe human Dao nurtures the form.\nWhat is gained within is lasting,\nWhat is gained without is fleeting.\nTo distance oneself from sound and color,\nTo moderate flavors and tastes—\nThis is the human Dao of nurturing the form.\nTo sever thought and contemplation,\nTo preserve the vital *qi*—\nThis is the true Dao of nurturing the spirit.\nTo cultivate the body and nurture nature,\nIs to gain both within and without—\nHow can one seek this through appearance, voice, or countenance?\n\nLaozi said:\nHeaven has its light,\nYet it does not fear the people’s darkness.\nEarth has its wealth,\nYet it does not fear the people’s poverty.\nThe truly Daoist, like a mountain,\nRemain unmoved and steady.\nThe traveler takes them as a guide,\nStraightforward yet sufficient in their offerings,\nNot seeking to bestow,\nNor receiving gratitude in return.\nThus, they are tranquil and endure.\nHeaven and Earth have no part in it,\nSo nothing is taken from them—\nNo virtue is claimed,\nSo no resentment arises.\nThose who are skilled at anger\nWill invite many grievances,\nThose who are skilled at giving\nWill invite many takings—\nOnly by following Heaven and Earth’s natural course\nCan one conquer principle.\nThus, praise leads to blame,\nGoodness leads to evil,\nHarm begins with benefit,\nCalamity follows fortune—\nTo not seek benefit is to avoid harm,\nTo not seek fortune is to avoid calamity.\nPreserving completeness is the norm for the body,\nWealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.\n\nThe Sage illuminates the land,\nYet the people do not grow dim,\nThe Sage stores riches in the world,\nYet the people do not grow poor.\nTo follow Heaven and Earth’s natural course,\nTo allow all things to grow of their own accord—\nNot to hoard for oneself,\nThus no need for public seizure,\nNot to bestow lightly,\nThus no need for harsh punishment.\nTo regard wealth and honor as passing clouds,\nIs to preserve one’s true nature.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Sage wears no extravagant garments,\nNor practices deceptive conduct.\nTheir clothing is simple,\nTheir actions unobserved,\nTheir way is open yet not ostentatious,\nTheir poverty is unshaken,\nTheir honor is not flaunted,\nTheir obscurity is not humiliating,\nTheir strangeness is not bizarre—\nTheir use is the same as all others,\nYet cannot be named—\nThis is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).\n\nPlain yet hidden,\nStrange yet not bizarre—\nThe virtuous do not indulge in such.\n\nExtravagant garments,\nDeceptive conduct—\nHow could these be the Sage’s affairs?\nTheir brilliance does not dazzle,\nTheir integrity is not ostentatious—\nThey simply share in the people’s common use.\nThis is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Daoist lives straightforward,\nWaiting for their fate.\nWhen time arrives,\nIt cannot be hastened or repelled.\nWhen time departs,\nIt cannot be pursued or retained.\nThus, the Sage does not advance to seek,\nNor retreat to yield.\nThree years of following time,\nTime departs and they move on.\nThree years of waiting for time,\nTime comes after them—\nNeither departing nor arriving,\nThey remain steadfast in their place.\n\nHeaven’s Dao knows no favoritism,\nOnly virtue is bestowed.\nWhen fortune comes,\nIt is not sought by oneself,\nSo they do not claim its merit.\nWhen calamity arrives,\nIt is not generated by oneself,\nSo they do not regret their actions.\nTheir center is serene,\nNot burdened by virtue,\nThe barking of dogs does not startle them,\nThey trust their own nature—\nTheir sincerity knows no division.\n\nThus, those who understand the Dao are not perplexed,\nThose who know fate are not anxious.\nWhen the Emperor dies,\nTheir remains are buried in the wild,\nYet their spirit is enshrined in the Bright Hall,\nFor the spirit is nobler than the form.\nThus, if the spirit governs the form,\nThey prosper.\nIf the form conquers the spirit,\nThey decline.\nThough cleverness may be employed,\nIt must ultimately return to the spirit—\nThis is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).」\n\n「The Dao is the shared path of all under Heaven. The Sage aligns with their true nature and awaits fate, neither grasping nor rejecting as fortune comes and goes. They stand at the center, governing the four directions—\nNot claiming merit when prosperity arrives,\nNor regretting actions when calamity strikes.\nTheir mind remains tranquil,\nUnderstanding the Dao and knowing fate,\nThough cleverness is employed,\nIt must ultimately return to the spirit—\n\nLaozi says: Those of old who preserved themselves\nFound joy in virtue and forgot lowliness,\nThus their resolve was steadfast—*unmovable by ambition*.\nThey delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty,\nThus their gain was *unshaken by desire*.\nHence, they could be humble yet joyful,\nQuiet yet serene.\n\nMeasuring life by years,\nThey fretted over the world’s chaos,\nAs one might fear the drying of the Yellow River,\nWeeping to nourish it instead.\nThus, those who do not fret over the world’s chaos\nBut rejoice in their own order,\nMay be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nThe Dao reveres virtue and values power,\nGiving delight to all hearts and preserving all within.\nThus, it does not stir their mind with poverty or lowliness,\nFor when their own nature is ordered,\nThe world’s turmoil is no longer a cause for worry.\nWould they then burden themselves with concerns\nFor a life not even a hundred years long?\nLaozi says: There are three sources of resentment in people—\nThose with high rank are envied by others,\nThose with great office are distrusted by their lord,\nThose with abundant wealth are resented by the people.\n\nThe higher the rank, the lower the intent,\nThe greater the office, the smaller the heart,\nThe richer the wealth, the broader the giving.\nCultivating these three,\nResentment does not arise.\n\nThus, nobility finds its root in humility,\nElevation in submission as its foundation.\nHigh rank breeds arrogance,\nOthers will envy it.\nGreat office fosters pride,\nThe lord will distrust it.\nAbundant wealth without generosity,\nOthers will resent it.\nThis is the Dao of *mutual undermining*—\n\nOnly through humility and generosity,\nWithout forgetting lowliness or submission,\nIs resentment avoided.\n\nLaozi says: Speech is the means by which one conveys their own nature to others,\nHearing is the means by which others convey their nature to oneself.\nIf one is both deaf and blind,\nThe Dao cannot pass through them.\nThus, those afflicted with deafness and blindness,\nDo not know how to convey or receive the Dao—\nAnd is it only the body that can be deaf and blind?\nThe heart too can be sealed,\nUnknowing how to convey or receive.\nThis is the kind of deafness and blindness.\n\nThe Dao as the ultimate principle,\nAll things with form arise from it—\nAs its kin, they are also close to it.\nThose who nourish on grains and *qi*,\nAll attain longevity—\nAs its ruler, they are also blessed.\nAll who are wise learn from it—\nAs its teacher, they are also enlightened.\n\nMost people harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless,\nThus they know not enough and their days are insufficient.\nThey seek the Dao in the midst of games of chance,\nTheir knowledge and insight deepen.\nWithout hearing or inquiry,\nThey are like the deaf and blind among people.\n\nTo receive form and live,\nIs the kin’s favor.\nTo nourish on grains and attain longevity,\nIs the ruler’s blessing.\nThrough learning, they become enlightened,\nIs the teacher’s virtue.\nTo grow and become an adult,\nIs also a kind of nobility.\n\nSpeech is the voice of the heart—\nTo convey oneself to others,\nWithout words, one cannot be heard;\nTo receive others into oneself,\nWithout words, one cannot be understood.\nThus, speech is the expression of the spirit.\n\nIf one does not let private words obstruct public words,\nAnd does not harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless,\nThen they hear the Dao deeply\nAnd do not stand alone against their superiors.\n\nLaozi says: Human nature,\nThe heart submits to virtue,\nNot to force.\nVirtue lies in giving, not in seeking.\n\nThus, the Sage who wishes to be noble among others,\nFirst makes others noble.\nWho wishes to be revered among others,\nFirst reveres others.\nWho wishes to conquer others,\nFirst conquers themselves.\nWho wishes to humble others,\nFirst humbles themselves.\nHence, nobility and humility,\nReverence and lowliness,\nThe Dao governs them.\n\nThe ancient Sages,\nWith their words, they led the people,\nWith their bodies, they followed behind.\nThus, the world gladly pushed them forward,\nYet they did not weary of it,\nAnd gladly bore them up,\nYet they did not grow heavy—\nThis was virtue overflowing and *qi* in harmony.\nHence, they knew that giving was taking,\nAnd following was leading.\nThey nearly reached the Dao.\n\nRitual values precedence,\nSpeech values humility—\nThis is human nature,\nThus they can be swayed by virtue,\nNot by force.\nHence, the Sage moves with measured steps,\nAnd acts with appropriate timing,\nThus the world gladly pushes them forward\nAnd gladly bears them up.\n\nLaozi says: Those with little virtue but much favor are ridiculed,\nThose with inferior talent but high position are in danger,\nThose with no great deeds but abundant wealth are despised.\nThus, some things benefit by being increased,\nWhile others are harmed by it.\nSome things are harmed by being decreased,\nWhile others benefit by it.\n\nThe common people know only to seek what is advantageous,\nYet they do not know to avoid what is harmful.\nOnly the Sage knows that harm can be advantageous,\nAnd advantage can be harmful.\n\nThus, the twice-hewn tree,\nIts roots must be wounded.\nThe household that hoards much,\nIts future must be cursed.\nThe greatest advantage,\nBecomes a source of harm—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nVirtue is never sated by abundance,\nBut one’s portion must not be exceeded.\nShallow waters cannot bear a great vessel,\nShallow roots cannot sustain a tall tree.\nIf a person’s virtue is thin and their talent shallow,\nYet they hold high office without benevolence,\nThey will rarely avoid ruin.\nOnly if one knows the reversals of advantage and harm,\nAnd does not cling to excessive hoarding,\nAttaining harmony between righteousness and gain,\nThen what harm remains?\n\nLaozi says: The petty person pursues gain with *guǒdé* (merely obtain),\nThe noble person pursues righteousness with *guǒyì* (merely uphold).\nThose who do good are not seeking fame,\nYet fame follows them.\nFame does not wait for advantage,\nYet advantage returns to them.\nWhat they seek is the same,\nWhat they strive for is different.\n\nThus, gain brings harm in its wake.\nThose whose words lack truth,\nWhose actions lack propriety,\nAre petty people.\nThose who excel in one matter,\nAnd are skilled in one ability,\nAre mediocre.\nThose who encompass all and possess all,\nWhose abilities are matched by their talent,\nAre the Sage.\n\nRound heads and square feet,\nTeeth clenched and hair worn,\nAll are human.\nYet the *qi* they inherit differs,\nAnd wisdom and folly divide them.\n\nThe petty person merely obtains,\nTheir talent outweighs their virtue;\nThe noble person merely upholds righteousness,\nTheir virtue outweighs their talent.\nIf one can ascend or descend,\nThey are mediocre.\nIf Heaven grants them many talents,\nThen they are the Sage.\n\nLaozi says: Life is a borrowed state,\nDeath is the return to it.\nThus, in times of order,\nThey defend righteousness with their life,\nIn times of chaos,\nThey defend their life with righteousness.\nOn the day of death,\nTheir actions reach their end.\n\nThus, the noble person carefully attends to this single use alone.»\n\nThe life one receives is from Heaven,\nThe fate one encounters is from the times.\nTo possess talent yet not meet the age—this is Heaven’s will.\nTo seek it must follow the Way,\nTo obtain it lies in fate.\n\nThe noble person may act virtuously,\nYet cannot guarantee receiving blessings,\nMay refrain from wrongdoing,\nYet cannot be certain of avoiding calamity.\n\nThus, when the time is right, they advance with righteousness—what greater fortune?\nWhen the time is not, they withdraw with propriety—what greater misfortune?\nYet even in poverty and lowliness, they regret nothing,\nFor they have found what is truly precious.\n\nBorn by Heaven’s command,\nShaped into human form—\nLife is a borrowed state,\nDeath is the return to it.\nWhat one encounters in the times\nMay bring hardship or prosperity—\nWhat is not fate?\n\nTo have talent yet not meet the age—this is Heaven’s will.\nThus, the noble person acts virtuously,\nYet blessings are not guaranteed;\nThey refrain from wrongdoing,\nYet calamity is not always avoided.\n\nWhen the time is right, they ride the tide;\nWhen it is not, they travel with humility—\nNobility lies within.\n\nLaozi says:\nWithin the heart, there is the *qi* of harmony and discord.\nWhen the heart is ordered, the *qi* flows smoothly;\nWhen the heart is disordered, the *qi* becomes inverted.\nThe order or disorder of the heart lies in the Dao.\n\nTo attain the Dao is to order the heart;\nTo lose the Dao is to disorder it.\nAn ordered heart brings mutual yielding;\nA disordered heart brings mutual contention.\nYielding brings virtue;\nContention breeds harm.\nVirtue brings smooth *qi*;\nHarm brings inverted *qi*.\nSmooth *qi* means self-sacrifice to benefit others;\nInverted *qi* means harming others for self-gain.\nThe *qi* can be regulated by the Dao.\n\nHeaven’s Way is like the echo answering sound—\nVirtue accumulated brings blessings;\nCalamity accumulated brings resentment.\nLearning is undermined by official favor;\nFilial piety wanes through wife and children;\nTrouble arises from neglecting worries;\nIllness worsens when near recovery.\nThus, to attend to the end as to the beginning,\nIs to have no failed endeavors.\n\n*The Yinshu* says:\nFive harms dwell in the heart,\nManifesting in Heaven’s realm—\nSmooth *qi* brings order,\nInverted *qi* brings chaos.\nOrder brings mutual yielding;\nChaos brings mutual contention.\nWhen *qi* inverts in the heart,\nIt harms the self.\nWhen *qi* inverts with the times,\nIt harms the state.\nOnly by the Dao can *qi* be regulated,\nThus one can sacrifice self to benefit others.\nThough officials may flourish, they cannot undermine my learning;\nThough wife and children may weaken my filial piety,\nWhat harm from neglected worries?\nWhat illness from near recovery?\nTo attend to the end with care,\nIs to lose nothing.\n\nLaozi says:\nTo raise the crooked with the straight—\nHow could this not succeed?\nTo raise the straight with the crooked—\nDo not let them proceed.\nThis is called \"same filth, different mud.\"\nWhy not say \"raise the crooked and set the straight\"?\nBut to raise the crooked with the straight—\nThis is to elevate the petty and return them to the noble—\nHow could this not succeed?\nTo raise the straight with the crooked—\nThis is to push the noble into the petty’s domain—\nThe noble will not go.\nSame filth, different mud—\nTo dwell in the petty’s Way,\nHarmonious yet unmoved.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Sage treats death and life alike,\nThe fool also treats death and life alike.\nThe Sage’s equality of death and life\nLies in understanding the divisions of principle;\nThe fool’s equality of death and life\nLacks knowledge of where harm and benefit lie.\n\nThe Dao is the countenance of Heaven,\nThings are the spread of Earth,\nHarmony belongs to humanity.\nWhen the ruler is not harmonious,\nHeaven’s *qi* does not descend,\nEarth’s *qi* does not ascend,\nYin and Yang are unbalanced,\nWinds and rains are untimely,\nAnd the people suffer hunger and sickness.\nHarmony’s use is supreme.\n\nHeaven gains clarity in all phenomena,\nEarth gains life in all things,\nHumanity gains success in all endeavors.\nHow could the ruler’s heart lose harmony?\nTo lose it means Heaven and Earth do not interact,\nAnd the people suffer hunger and sickness.\n\nThough the Sage and the fool share death and life,\nTheir difference lies between righteousness and self-interest.\nSelf-interest is the harmony of righteousness—\nThe Sage understands principle,\nAnd even the division of benefits is righteousness.\nThe fool knows not where harm and benefit lie,\nAnd righteousness becomes self-interest.\n\nLaozi says:\nTo command ten thousand soldiers\nIs not as valuable as hearing a single appropriate word;\nTo possess the Random Marquis’ pearl\nIs not as valuable as knowing the origin of things;\nTo possess the He Shi’s jade\nIs not as valuable as knowing the proper course of things.\n\nThough the world be vast,\nThose who delight in war perish;\nThough a state be secure,\nThose who love war are in danger.\nThus, even small states with tenfold weapons\nShould not use them.\n\nYu bowed to Chang Yan:\n\"Return the troops, and the Miao people will submit.\"\nTo hear a single appropriate word\nIs to triumph over ten thousand armies.\nTo possess the Random pearl and He Shi’s jade\nIs not as valuable as knowing the origin and proper course of things.\n\nThus, the Sage values the Dao over treasures,\nAnd virtue over achievements.\nWould they willingly endanger themselves with arms?\n\nLaozi says:\nThose who can achieve hegemony\nMust first excel in virtue;\nThose who can defeat enemies\nMust first be strong;\nThose who can be strong\nMust first employ the people’s strength;\nThose who can employ the people’s strength\nMust first win the people’s hearts;\nThose who can win the people’s hearts\nMust first attain self-mastery;\nThose who attain self-mastery\nMust first be gentle and yielding;\nThose who can defeat those not their equal\nYet submit to those their equal\nAnd yield to those superior—\nGentle strength emerges beyond their equal,\nIts effects are beyond measure.\nThus, only the Sage can\nTurn many who cannot win\nInto great victory.\n\nExcellence in virtue brings hegemony—\nWinning the people’s hearts.\nVictory over enemies brings strength—\nEmploying the people’s strength.\nYet without winning the people’s hearts,\nNo one can employ their strength.\nHow then can enemies be defeated?\nHow can strength achieve hegemony?\nVirtue is self-mastery.\nSelf-mastery makes gentle strength conquer the rigid.\nThus, to defeat those not one’s equal,\nYet submit to those one’s equal—\nThis is virtue being equal.\nGentle strength emerges beyond one’s equal—\nThen virtue surpasses even me.\nThus, only the Sage can\nTurn many who cannot win\nInto great victory.\n\n*Completing the Continuation of the True Mysterious Classic, Volume Four.*\n\n**Continuation of the True Mysterious Classic, Volume Five**\n*Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*\n**Chapter on Dao and Virtue**\n\nWenzi asked about the Dao, and Laozi replied:\n*\"Learning and inquiry are not refined, listening to the Way is not profound.\nAll who listen seek to attain wisdom,\nTo perfect their conduct,\nTo achieve fame and merit.\nWithout refinement, there is no clarity;\nWithout depth, there is no understanding.\nThus, the highest learning listens with the spirit,\nThe middle with the heart,\nThe lowest with the ears.\nHe who listens with the ears learns only on the surface;\nHe who listens with the heart learns to the marrow;\nHe who listens with the spirit learns to the bone.\nIf listening is not profound, knowledge remains unclear;\nIf knowledge is unclear, one cannot exhaust its essence;\nIf one cannot exhaust its essence, conduct cannot be fulfilled.\n\nThe principle of listening is this:\nEmpty the heart, clear the mind,\nDiminish the qi, let it not overflow,\nHold no thoughts, no deliberations,\nLet the eyes see nothing in vain,\nLet the ears hear nothing carelessly.\nConcentrate with precision, accumulate within—\nLet the inner intent gather and merge.\nOnce attained, guard it firmly,\nHold it steadfastly.\n\nHuman nature is the Dao,\nNature’s goodness is virtue—\nDao and virtue reside within us.\nThus, the Sage knows without learning—\nThis is called the Dao.\nTo cultivate it is called teaching—\nThus, what is within us is applied to others.\n\nThe middling and below can all learn it:\nListening with the ears brings delight to the heart,\nLike a mirror polished—\nIts light shines forth from within.\nIs this not what the heart inherently possesses?\nThrough study, it is made clear—\nTo cultivate the self brings virtue to fruition,\nTo govern the state brings success to undertakings.\nThis shows how refined learning illuminates the heart.\n\nThe Dao has no beginning in origin,\nIt begins with gentleness and weakness,\nCompletes with strength and vigor,\nBegins with few and short,\nCompletes with many and long.\nA ten-surrounding tree begins as a sapling,\nA hundred-foot tower begins with a foundation.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe Sage follows it:\nThe lowly humble themselves,\nThe retiring step back,\nThe frugal diminish themselves,\nThe self-effacing reduce themselves—\nThus, lowliness becomes exalted,\nRetreat becomes precedence,\nFrugality becomes abundance,\nSelf-effacement becomes greatness.\nThis is how the Dao of Heaven is fulfilled.\n\nQi is the formless essence,\nThings are the formed *qi*.\nThe formless is thus gentle and weak,\nThe formed is thus strong and rigid.\nThus, *qi* is the origin of form.\nThe Dao generates virtue, nurtures it,\nFrom subtlety to manifestation.\nThe Sage follows it,\nEstablishing its essence, enacting its function—\nThe Dao of Heaven is complete.\n\nThe Dao is the root of virtue,\nThe root of Heaven,\nThe gate to blessings—\nAll things depend on it to arise,\nDepend on it to flourish,\nDepend on it to find peace.\nThe Dao is non-action, formless,\nWithin, it cultivates the self;\nWithout, it governs others—\nAchieving success, establishing deeds.\nIt aligns with Heaven,\nDoes nothing yet accomplish all—\nNo one knows its essence,\nNo one knows its truth,\nYet within it, there is sincerity.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven has the Dao,\nThe world submits, and the altars endure.\nWhen lords and marquises have the Dao,\nThe people live in harmony, their states unlost.\nWhen scholars and commoners have the Dao,\nThey preserve their bodies, protect their kin.\nThe strong with the Dao conquer without war;\nThe weak with the Dao gain without strife.\nUndertakings with the Dao succeed, bringing blessings.\nBetween ruler and subject, the Dao brings loyalty and benevolence;\nBetween father and son, the Dao brings filial piety and kindness;\nAmong scholars and commoners, the Dao brings mutual love.\nThus, with the Dao, there is harmony;\nWithout it, there is harshness.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nThe Dao applies to all people.\nVirtue roots in the heart,\nSpirit manifests outward.\nSuccess achieved, deeds established—\nAligned with Heaven.\nFrom the Son of Heaven to the commoner,\nWith the Dao, there is prosperity;\nWithout it, there is stagnation.\n\nThe Dao:\nSmall practice brings small blessings,\nGreat practice brings great blessings,\nPerfect practice brings the world’s submission—\nSubmission brings loyalty.\nThus, the Emperor is the world’s *adaptation*,\nThe King is the world’s *direction*—\nWithout adaptation or direction, one cannot be called Emperor or King.\nThus, without the people, even the Sage cannot succeed;\nGaining the people yet losing the Dao cannot be sustained.\n\nThose who lose the Dao:\nAre extravagant, arrogant, and licentious,\nProud and insolent, boastful and domineering,\nSeeking to outshine others, grasping at power—\nThey become the instigators of strife,\nThe leaders of rebellion.\nWhen commoners act thus, they bring ruin upon themselves;\nWhen the great act thus, their states perish—\nShallowly affecting themselves,\nDeeply affecting their descendants.\nThus, no crime is greater than losing the Dao,\nNo resentment deeper than lacking virtue.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe root of the body lies in virtue,\nThe root of virtue lies in the Dao.\nWhether small or great,\nPractice it and you attain it—\nThe world submits to you,\nSubmission brings loyalty.\nThe Emperor is *adaptation*,\nThe King is *direction*—\nThe world adapts and follows—\nThis is called Emperor and King.\nYet only with the people can one succeed,\nOnly with the Dao can one endure—\nNot becoming the instigator of war,\nNot becoming the leader of rebellion.\nLose the Dao and there is chaos,\nLose virtue and there is resentment.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Those who practice the Dao make even the bold\nSo that spears cannot pierce them,\nMake even the cunning\nSo that strikes cannot find them.\nYet even so, they may still be humiliated—\nBetter to make the bold not dare to strike,\nThe cunning not dare to attack.\nBut even this is not as good as\nMaking them have no such intent at all.\nAnd even this is not as good as\nMaking them have no desire for gain.\nIf all men and women in the world\nWere to joyfully seek what is beneficial—\nThen even without a throne, one would be the sovereign,\nWithout an office, one would be the leader—\nAnd all would willingly seek what is beneficial for them.*\n\n*The Dao does not deliberately respond to things,\nYet things respond to it.\nTo be unharmed by spears or strikes\nIs not as good as\nMaking all joyfully desire what is beneficial—\nThus, even without a throne, one is the sovereign,\nWithout an office, one is the leader—\nAnd all willingly seek what is beneficial for them.\"*\n\n「In ancient times, there was a man named Gēngsāngzǐ, whose virtue was such.\n\nWénzǐ asked about virtue, and Lǎozǐ replied:\nTo **nurture** and **cultivate** [畜之养之],\nTo **fulfill** and **lead** [遂之长之],\nTo **comprehend** and **share benefits** without discrimination [兼利无择],\nAnd to **harmonize** with Heaven and Earth [与天地合]—\nThis is what is called virtue [此之谓德].\n\nWhat is meant by *rén* [仁]?\nFor the ruler, it means not **boasting** of one’s achievements [为上不矜其功],\nFor the subjects, it means not **shaming** their weaknesses [为下不羞其病].\nToward the great, one is not **arrogant** [於大不矜],\nToward the small, one is not **petty** [於小不偷],\nTo **cherish** and **love** without selfishness [兼爱无私],\nAnd to endure without **waning** [久而不衰]—\nThis is what is called *rén* [仁].\n\nWhat is meant by *yì* [义]?\nFor the ruler, it means **supporting** the weak [为上即辅弱],\nFor the subjects, it means **upholding** propriety [为下即守节].\nWhen prosperous, one does not **indulge** in willfulness [达不肆意],\nWhen in adversity, one does not **alter** one’s principles [穷不易操].\nTo **adhere** to a single standard and **conform** to the natural order [一度顺理],\nWithout **bending** to private gain or **perverting** justice [不私枉挠]—\nThis is what is called *yì* [义].\n\nWhat is meant by *lǐ* [礼]?\nFor the ruler, it means **reverent** and **solemn** conduct [为上即恭严],\nFor the subjects, it means **humble** and **respectful** bearing [为下即卑敬].\nTo **retreat** and **yield**, guarding gentleness [退让守柔],\nAnd to **embody** the receptive principle for all under Heaven [为天下雌],\nTo **stand** where none dare [立於不敢],\nAnd to **establish** what none can [设於不能]—\nThis is what is called *lǐ* [礼].\n\nThus, when one cultivates virtue, the subjects **obey** one’s commands [修其德则下从令],\nWhen one cultivates *rén* [仁], the subjects do not **quarrel** [修其仁则下不争],\nWhen one cultivates *yì* [义], the subjects are **fair** and **upright** [修其义即下平正],\nWhen one cultivates *lǐ* [礼], the subjects **hold one in honor** [修其礼则下尊敬].\nIf these four are all cultivated, the state is **secure** and **tranquil** [国家安宁].\n\nHence, **Dao/Way** is what gives rise to things [物生者道也],\nVirtue is what makes them grow [长者德也],\n*Rén* [仁] is what brings love [爱者仁也],\nJustice is what brings rectitude [正者义也],\nRespect is what brings reverence [敬者礼也].\n\nWithout **nurturing** or **cultivating**, one cannot **fulfill** and **lead** to growth [不畜不养，不能遂长].\nWithout **compassion** and **love**, one cannot **achieve** and **complete** [不慈不爱，不能成遂].\nWithout **rectitude** and **upholding**, one cannot **endure** and **last** [不正不匡，不能久长].\nWithout **reverence** and **favor**, one cannot **be held in esteem** [不敬不宠，不能贵重].\n\nThus, virtue is what the people **value** [德者，民之所贵也],\n*Rén* [仁] is what the people **cherish** [仁者，民之所怀也],\n*Yì* [义] is what the people **fear** [义者，民之所畏也],\n*Lǐ* [礼] is what the people **revere** [礼者，民之所敬也].\nThese four are the **orderly principles** of culture [此四者，文之顺也],\nBy which the **sage** governs all things [圣人之所以御万物也].\n\nIf a **gentleman** lacks virtue, the subjects **resent** him [无德即下怨],\nIf he lacks *rén* [仁], the subjects **quarrel** [无仁即下争],\nIf he lacks *yì* [义], the subjects **act violently** [无义即下暴],\nIf he lacks *lǐ* [礼], the subjects **become disorderly** [无礼即下乱].\nThe four **classical teachings** [四经] not established—\nThis is called **lacking Dao/Way** [谓之无道].\nThere is none who lacks Dao/Way yet does not **perish** [无道不亡者，未之有也].\n\nVirtue is the **overarching name** of the Five Constants [德者，五常之总名].\nA person with virtue possesses the Five Constants in full [有德之人，五常备焉].\n*Cí* [慈] is **benevolence** [七则慈],\n*Yì* [义] is **appropriateness** [义则宜],\n*Lǐ* [礼] is **reverence** [礼则敬],\n*Zhì* [智] is **clarity** [知则明],\n*Sīn* [信] is **truthfulness** [信则实].\nThese are called the Five Constants [有之是谓五常],\nOr also the Five Virtues [一曰五德].\nNo **gentleman** has ever lacked virtue yet been able to **serve the state** [君子未有无德而能为国家者矣].\n\nWénzǐ’s inquiry was for the **benefit** of all under Heaven and future generations [文子之问，为天下后世发也],\nHis virtue was indeed **vast** [其德博哉].\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nIn the age of **supreme virtue** [至德之世],\nMerchants found **profit** in the markets [贾便於市],\nFarmers took **joy** in the fields [农乐於野],\nGreat officials **rested content** in their duties [大夫安其职处],\nScholars **refined** their **Dao/Way** [士修其道],\nAnd the people **rejoiced** in their **occupations** [人民乐其业].\nThus, the winds and rains did not **destroy** or **break** [风雨不毁折],\nGrasses and trees did not **wither** and **die** prematurely [草木不夭死],\nThe Yellow River **unveiled** its **Turtle Scripture** [河出图],\nAnd the Luo River **revealed** its **Book of History** [洛出书].\nBut when the age **declined** [及世之衰也],\nTaxes and levies were **without measure** [赋敛无度],\nSlayings were **without end** [杀戮无止],\nAnd **punishments** were meted out to the **virtuous** [刑谏者，杀贤士],\nThus the mountains **collapsed** and the rivers **ran dry** [山崩川涸],\nWorms and insects **teemed** without rest [蠕动不息],\nAnd the fields **yielded no grain** [野无百蔬].\nHence, when the age is **well-ordered**, even the **foolish** cannot **act alone in chaos** [愚者不得独乱],\nAnd when the age is **disordered**, even the **wise** cannot **restore order alone** [贤者不能独治].\n\nThus, the **sage** **harmonizes** and **adapts**, **preserving tranquility**—\nThis is **life** [生也].\nTo **fulfill one’s aspirations** and **practice the Dao/Way**—\nThis is **fate** [命也],\nSo **life** depends on **fate**, and only then can one **act** [生遭命而后能行],\nAnd **fate** is realized when the **time** is right [命得时而后能明].\nThere must first be its **age**, and only then can there be its **person** [必有其世，而后有其人].\nHeaven’s **regard** for humanity is like a father’s **regard** for his children,\nIts **love** is **equally distributed** [其爱均也].\n\nThe **ruler** is Heaven’s **firstborn son** [天之元子],\nAnd the people are Heaven’s **cherished children** [民，天之赤子].\nIf the ruler does not **care** for the people [上不恤下],\nHeaven will **send warnings** [天必示儆].\n\nIn the age of **supreme virtue**, love is **equally distributed** and **harmonizes** with Heaven [爱均合天],\nAll things **grow** in accordance [万物遂长],\nAnd the people **rejoice** in their **occupations** [民乐其业].\nWhen the age **declines**, harsh governance **disrupts** harmony [苛政干和],\nHeaven’s **wrath** **shakes** and **reveals** itself [天怒震发],\nThe earth **manifests** its **calamities** [地见其灾],\nThe state **abounds** in **difficulties** [国家多难],\nAnd **plagues** spread among the people [流毒民人].\nOnly the **sage** **harmonizes** and **adapts**, **preserving tranquility**,\nFulfills his **aspirations**, and **practices the Dao/Way**,\nThus the people and things **grow** in accordance [民物遂生].\nThis is what is meant by:\nThere must first be its **age**, and only then can there be its **person** [有其世而后有其人].\n\nWénzǐ asked about **sagely wisdom** [圣智],\nAnd Lǎozǐ replied:\nTo **hear** and **know** [闻而知之] is **sagely wisdom** [圣也],\nTo **see** and **know** [见而知之] is **wisdom** [智也].\nThus, the **sage** always **listens** to where **calamity** and **blessing** arise,\nAnd **chooses** his **Dao/Way** accordingly [而择其道],\nWhile the **wise** always **observe** where **calamity** and **blessing** take form,\nAnd **chooses** their **conduct** accordingly [而择其行].\nThe **sage** knows the **Dao/Way** of Heaven’s **auspicious** and **inauspicious** signs [故知祸福所生],\nThus he knows where **calamity** and **blessing** arise.\nThe **wise** **foresee** the **formed** signs,\nThus he knows the **gates** of **calamity** and **blessing** [故知祸福之门].\nTo **hear** before they arise—this is **sagely wisdom** [闻未生，圣也],\nTo **foresee** the **formed** signs—this is **wisdom** [先见成形，智也],\nWithout **hearing** or **seeing**, one is **foolish** and **bewildered** [无闻见者愚迷也].\n\nWhy does the **sage** not say *shēngzhī* [生知] but *wénzhī* [闻知]?\nFor **innate knowledge** is **within oneself** [生知道在我者也],\nWhile **acquired knowledge** is **from external matters** [闻知事在外者也].\nThe **sage** **knows** before it **happens** [闻於未然],\nThus **calamity** and **blessing** are **foreseen** [祸福先知].\n**Wisdom**, however, must **await** the **formation** of events before **seeing** [必待事成而后见],\nAnd the **foolish** are **drowned** in **hearing** and **seeing**,\nYet **never** truly **know themselves** [终不自知],\nTheir **bewilderment** is indeed **great** [迷亦甚矣].\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nIf a **ruler** **loves** to **know** [好知],\nHe will **trust** the **times** and **rely** on himself [信时而任己],\n**Discard** the **calculations** of fate [弃数],\nAnd **employ** **benevolence** [用惠].\nThings are **abundant** in **wisdom** but **shallow** in **understanding** [物博智浅],\nTo **sustain** abundance with shallowness—\nThis has never **existed** [以浅赡博，未之有也].\nTo **rely solely** on one’s **wisdom**,\nOne’s **failures** will be **many** [独任其智，失必多矣].\nTo **love wisdom** is to **exhaust** one’s **arts** [好智，穷术也],\nTo **love courage** is to **court** **peril** and **ruin** [好勇，危亡之道也].\nTo **love giving** is to **lack** a **fixed portion** [好与则无定分],\nIf the ruler’s **portion** is **not fixed** [上之分不定],\nThen the people’s **expectations** will be **without end** [下之望无止].\nIf he **taxes excessively**, he will **become a target** for the people’s **resentment** [若多敛即与民为条],\nTaking little yet giving much—\nHis **numbers** will **never** be **sufficient** [其数无有],\nThus, to **love giving** is the **path** to **inviting grievances** [故好与，来怨之道也].\nFrom this, it can be seen:\nThat **wealth** is **insufficient** to **sustain** governance,\nAnd that **Dao/Way** and **arts** can **depend** on **clarity** [财不足任，道术可因明矣].\n\nThe **wise** do not **do** what they **cannot** do [智者不为其所不能为],\nNor **force** what they **cannot** force [强所不能].\nIf one does so, it is **not wisdom** [则非智矣].\nThen can wisdom truly be **loved**?\nTo **love wisdom** is to **exhaust** one’s **arts** [好智则术易穷],\nTo **love giving** is to **lack** a **fixed portion** [好与则分不定].\nExcessive **taxation** **provokes** the people’s **retaliation** [多敛民雠],\nAnd **inviting grievances** is the **means** to **disorder** [来怨之媒也].\n\nWénzǐ asked:\nHow did the **ancient kings** govern all under Heaven by **Dao/Way** [古之王者以道莅天下为之奈何]?\nLǎozǐ replied:\nBy **holding to the One** and **doing nothing** [执一无为],\n**Conforming** with Heaven and Earth’s **transformations** [因天地与之变化].\nAll under Heaven is the **great vessel** [天下大器],\nWhich **cannot** be **grasped** or **acted upon** [不可执也，不可为也].\nTo **act** upon it is to **ruin** it [为者败之],\nTo **grasp** it is to **lose** it [执者失之].\nTo **hold to the One** is to **see** the **small** [执一者见小也],\nTo **see** the **small** is to **achieve** the **great** [见小故能成大也].\nTo **do nothing** is to **guard** the **still** [无为者守静也],\nTo **guard** the **still** is to **bring rectitude** to all under Heaven [守静故能为天下正].」\n\nTo dwell in **great fullness** yet **not overflow**,\nTo occupy **high nobility** yet **not grow arrogant**.\nTo dwell in **greatness without excess**—\n**Full yet unspent**, **elevated yet secure**—\n**Full yet unspent**, so as to **long preserve wealth**;\n**Elevated yet secure**, so as to **long preserve nobility**.\nThus **wealth and nobility** never depart from one’s person,\nAnd **blessings extend to descendants**—\nThis was the **ancient kings’ Dao/Way**.\n\nTo govern all under Heaven by **Dao/Way** is to **\"hold to the One\" and \"do nothing\"**—\nHow so?\n**The One** is **established**.\n\nThus the **ancient kings**, conforming with Heaven and Earth’s **transformations**,\n**Ruled by doing nothing**,\n**Saw the small yet did not abandon it**,\n**Guarded stillness yet did not act**—\nThe **great vessel** stood firm, and all under Heaven was **rectified**.\n\nTherefore, to dwell in **greatness without excess**,\nTo occupy **high station without arrogance**—\n**Wealth and nobility** may be **preserved**,\nAnd **descendants** may endure.\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nThe people have **Dao/Way** to follow in common,\nAnd **laws** to uphold in common,\nYet **morality cannot bind them**,\nNor **authority compel them**—\nThus **kings are established** to **unify them**.\n\nWhen the king **holds to the One**, order is achieved;\nWhen he **abandons constancy**, chaos ensues.\nThe **Way of the king** is not to **act**,\nBut to **do nothing**.\n\nThe **wise** do not **wield virtue as a tool**,\nThe **courageous** do not **use force as violence**,\nThe **benevolent** do not **grant favors by rank**—\nThis is **the One**.\n**The One** is the **Dao/Way of no partiality**,\nThe **root of all things**.\n\nIf the king **frequently alters laws**,\nAnd the state **frequently changes rulers**,\nThen people **act according to their positions**,\n**Expressing their likes and dislikes**—\nThe common folk **live in fear**, beyond governance.\nThus, when the king **loses the One**, the **foundation of disorder** is worse than **having no king**.\nOnly when the king **holds to the One** can he **unify the people**.\n\nThough all under Heaven is vast,\nThe king **unifies it by the One**.\nWhen the king **holds to the One**,\n**Dao/Way** requires no **action**—the people **follow in common**;\n**Laws** require no **change**—the people **uphold them in common**.\nThe **wise** do not **wield virtue as a tool**,\nThe **courageous** do not **use force as violence**,\nThe **benevolent** do not **grant favors by rank**—\n**Unified**, this is the king’s **Way**.\n\nIf the king **frequently alters laws**,\nAnd the state **frequently changes rulers**,\nThis is worse than **having no king**.\n\nWénzǐ asked:\nHow many **principles** does the **Way of kingship** encompass?\nLǎozǐ replied:\n**One** alone.\n\nWénzǐ said:\nIn antiquity, some ruled by **Dao/Way**, others by **force**—\nWhy are they not the same?\nLǎozǐ said:\nThose who ruled by **Dao/Way** did so by **virtue**;\nThose who ruled by **force** also did so by **virtue**.\n\nThere are **five kinds of warfare**:\n**Righteous war**, **Responsive war**, **Angry war**, **Greedy war**, **Arrogant war**.\nTo **punish tyranny and aid the weak** is called **righteousness**;\nWhen the enemy attacks and there is **no alternative**, to use force is called **responsive**;\nTo **quarrel over trifles and fail to control one’s anger** is called **anger**;\nTo **covet another’s land** or **desire their wealth** is called **greed**;\nTo **rely on one’s nation’s size** and **boast of one’s people’s multitude**, desiring to **appear superior** to enemy states, is called **arrogance**.\n\n**Righteous war** brings **kingship**,\n**Responsive war** brings **victory**,\n**Angry war** brings **defeat**,\n**Greedy war** brings **ruin**,\n**Arrogant war** brings **extinction**—\nThis is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.\n\n**Dao/Way** is the **root of governance**;\nThe king rules by **Dao/Way**.\nWhen the **root is lost**, **chaos arises**,\nAnd **warfare ensues**.\n\nThus, though some ruled by **Dao/Way** and others by **force**,\nThough they seemed different, they **both returned to virtue**.\nTherefore, of the **five kinds of warfare**, only **righteous war** can bring **kingship**—\nThough it is **war**, it is also **Dao/Way**.\nHence it is said: **One alone**.\n\n**Responsive war** brings **victory**,\n**Angry war** brings **defeat**,\n**Greedy war** brings **ruin**,\n**Arrogant war** brings **extinction**—\nThese are the affairs of the **Warring States**, not the **warfare of kings**.\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nTo **abandon Dao/Way** and **rely on cleverness** is **perilous**,\nTo **discard principles** and **use talent** is **constraining**.\nThus, to **follow one’s proper role** and **conform to reason**—\nWhen **lost**, one need not **fear**,\nWhen **gained**, one need not **rejoice**—\n**Success is not what one strives for**,\n**Gain is not what one seeks**.\n\nWhen **receiving**, one **accepts without taking**,\nWhen **giving**, one **bestows without bestowing**.\nTo **generate in spring**, to **withdraw in autumn**—\nWhat is **generated** is not **resented**,\nWhat is **withdrawn** is not **held in grudge**—\nThis is **approaching Dao/Way**.\n\n**Dao/Way** lies in **governance**,\n**Principles** relate to **timing**.\nTo **rely on cleverness** and **abandon Dao/Way**,\nTo **use talent** and **discard principles**—\nThese are the **steps to peril and constraint**.\n\nOnly by **following one’s proper role** and **conforming to reason**,\nWhen **gained**, one does not **rejoice in achievement**,\nWhen **lost**, one does not **fear retreat**—\nWhen **receiving**, one **accepts without taking**,\nWhen **giving**, one **bestows without bestowing**,\nTo **act in accordance with the seasons**,\n**Generation** is not **resented**,\n**Withdrawal** is not **held in grudge**—\nThen one **approaches Dao/Way**.\n\nWénzǐ asked:\nHow does a king **win the people’s affection**?\nLǎozǐ replied:\nLike the **great rivers and seas**—\n**Diluted**, **without distinct flavor**,\n**Used without depletion**,\n**First small, then vast**.\n\nThose who **seek to surpass others** must **lower themselves in speech**,\nThose who **seek to lead others** must **place themselves last in action**.\nAll under Heaven will **emulate their affection**,\n**Advance their benevolence and righteousness**,\nAnd **lack harshness**.\nTo **stand above** yet the people **do not feel burdened**,\nTo **lead ahead** yet the masses **do not feel harmed**—\nAll under Heaven **joyfully follow** without **tiring**,\nEven in **remote lands and alien customs**,\nEven among **insects and creatures**—\nNone fail to **hold them dear**.\nThere is **nothing they cannot communicate with**,\nAnd **nothing they cannot accomplish**—\nThus they are **held in highest esteem**.\n\nThe **rivers and seas** excel in **humility and capacity**,\nThus all streams **flow to them**.\nThe **ancient kings** modeled themselves after this to **govern**.\n\nTo **contain the people** and **nurture the masses**,\nThus they **won the people’s affection**,\nAnd the people **joyfully submitted**—\nAll under Heaven **rallied to them**.\nEven **grasses, trees, and insects** would **submit in awe**—\nTheir **nobility** is evident.\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nTo **clutch the laws of one’s age**,\nAnd **reject the customs of succession**,\nIs like **gluing a pillar to a zither**—\n**rigid and out of tune**.\n\nThe **sage** adapts to **circumstances**, **varies with the times**,\n**Sees the form** and **applies what is fitting**.\nWhen **ages change**, **affairs must change**,\nWhen **times shift**, **customs must adapt**.\nTo **discuss the age** and **establish laws**,\nTo **follow the times** and **conduct affairs**.\n\nThe **ancient kings** had **different laws**—\nNot **intentionally contrary**,\nBut because **circumstances differed**.\nThus, they did not **follow rigidly the laws already set**,\nBut **followed the principles behind them**,\nAnd **moved with transformation**.\n\nThe **sage’s laws** are **worthy of observation**,\nBut their **origins cannot be traced**,\nTheir **words can be heard**,\nBut their **intentions cannot be fully grasped**.\n\n---\n\nThe **Three Sovereigns** and **Five Emperors** held the world lightly,\n**Cherished all things** with care,\n**Equalized life and death**,\n**Unified change and transformation**,\n**Embraced the Dao/Way** and **pursued sincerity**,\nTo **mirror the emotions** of all things,\n**Above**, they **made the Dao/Way their friend**,\n**Below**, they **transformed with humanity**.\n\nNow, if one wishes to **learn their Dao/Way**,\nThey cannot grasp their **clear and profound, sacred and august** virtue/power,\nBut must **guard their legal precedents**,\nAnd **follow their decrees and ordinances**,\nOr they will **never be able to govern properly**.\n\nThe **single qi** circulates,\nThe **four seasons** shift in succession.\nThere are **things that cannot be otherwise**—\nSuch is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.\n\nThe governance of **emperors** and **kings** differs,\nNot because of **human contrivance**,\nBut due to **Heaven’s unfolding**.\n\nThus, one cannot **cling to the laws of a single age**\nAnd **expect them to govern successive eras**—\nOnly by **acting according to the times**,\nAnd **adapting measures to circumstances**,\nCan one **discuss the age** and **establish laws**.\n\nLike **winter cannot wear hemp cloth**,\nAnd **summer cannot wear fur garments**,\nThose who **know the Dao/Way of Heaven** can do this.\n\n**Wenzi** asked about governance,\nAnd **Laozi** replied:\n**\"Rule with the Dao/Way**, nurture with **virtue/power**,\n**Do not flaunt wisdom**, **do not force strength**,\n**Reduce excess** while **holding to unity**,\n**Do not show favor**, **do not reveal desires**,\n**Be square without cutting corners**, **be sharp without piercing**,\n**Neither proud nor boastful**.\n\n**\"Rule with the Dao/Way**, and the people will **attach themselves**,\n**Nurture with virtue/power**, and the people will **submit**,\n**Do not flaunt wisdom**, and the people will **remain content**,\n**Do not force strength**, and the people will **retain their simplicity**.\"\n\n**\"Do not flaunt wisdom\"** means **to be humble**,\n**\"Do not force strength\"** means **to avoid coercion**.\n**Below**, they **gather** with **generosity**,\n**Take** with **moderation**,\n**Practice frugality** to **preserve themselves**,\nAnd **never dare to be complacent**.\n\n**If they do not gather**, they will **scatter**,\n**If they do not nurture**, they will **rebel**,\n**If they flaunt wisdom**, the people will **vie for advantage**,\n**If they force strength**, the people will **resent their rule**.\n\n**When the people scatter**, the **state’s power weakens**,\n**When they rebel**, the **ruler loses authority**,\n**When they vie for advantage**, they **disregard right and wrong**,\n**When they resent their ruler**, the **throne is in peril**.\n\nIf these **four principles** are truly **cultivated**,\nThe **Dao/Way** is nearly **fulfilled**.\n\nThe **ancients governed** with **virtue/power and Dao/Way**,\nLater ages governed with **achievement and force**.\n**With virtue/power and Dao/Way**, the people **submit** and **customs become pure**,\n**With achievement and force**, the people **resent** and **wars arise**.\n\nThus, **\"rule with the Dao/Way**, nurture with **virtue/power**,\n**Do not flaunt wisdom**, **do not force strength**,\nAnd the world will be **governed without action**.\"\n\n**Laozi** said:\n**\"When the ruler speaks, the people act**—\n**When the people speak, the ruler acts**—\n**When the ruler speaks, it is constant usage**,\n**When the people act, it is expedient adaptation**.\nOnly the **sage** can **know expedient adaptation**,\n**Speak and always be believed**,\n**Set expectations and always meet them**.\n\nThe **highest conduct** in the world:\n**To be straight and honor one’s father**,\n**To be trustworthy and die for one’s mother**—\nWho can **value this**?\n\nThus, the **sage** **judges right and wrong in affairs**,\n**Accommodates with bending and stretching**,\n**Has no fixed rituals or appearances**,\n**When prosperous, they are called a ‘named lord’**,\n**When drowning, they are struck like a father**—\n**Power compels this**.\n\n**Expedient adaptation** is what the **sage** **alone perceives**,\n**To first oppose and then unite** is called **expedient adaptation**,\n**To first unite and then meet** is **not to know expedient adaptation**,\n**Not to know expedient adaptation** is **to turn good into evil**.\n\n**\"When the ruler speaks and the people act\"** is the **substance of expedient adaptation**,\n**\"When the people act and the ruler responds\"** is the **application of expedient adaptation**.\n**Substance and application** of **expedient adaptation** **complement each other**,\n**No matter the affair**, **all will be fitting**.\n\nOnly the **sage** **knows expedient adaptation**,\n**Speaks and is always believed**,\n**Sets expectations and always meets them**,\n**Accommodates with bending and stretching**,\nAnd **judges their opposition and unity**.\n\nIf one **clings to the middle without expedient adaptation**,\nThey **cannot adapt to changing times**.\n**Gluing a pillar to a zither**—\n**Goodness turns to folly**.\n\n**Wenzi** asked:\n\"Master, your words say\n**That without virtue/power and Dao/Way, one cannot govern the world**,\nYet **the rulers of ancient times**,\n**Who inherited their positions and relied on former achievements**,\nAlso had **those without the Dao/Way** who **preserved their reigns**,\nAnd **no calamity or ruin**—\nHow was this **Dao/Way** accomplished?\"\n\n**Laozi** replied:\n\"From the **Son of Heaven** down to the **common people**,\nEach **lives their own life**,\nYet their **living has degrees of depth**—\nThe world **at times sees states and families destroyed**,\nNot because of **lack of virtue/power and Dao/Way**.\n\n**With virtue/power and Dao/Way**, they **diligently strive day and night**,\n**Tremble and fear constantly**,\nEver **mindful of impending danger**.\n**Without virtue/power and Dao/Way**, they **indulge desires and grow lax**,\nTheir **ruin comes without warning**.\n\nIf **Jie and Zhou** had **practiced virtue/power and Dao/Way**,\nEven **Tang and Wu**, though **wise and virtuous**,\nCould **not have established their achievements**.\n\n**Virtue/power and Dao/Way** are **how one nurtures and sustains**,\n**How one fosters mutual affection**,\n**How one upholds respect and honor**.\n\nEven **deaf insects**, though **foolish**,\n**Do not harm what they love**—\nIf **all people in the world** **harbored hearts of benevolence and righteousness**,\nHow could **calamities and disasters arise**?\n\nThose **without virtue/power and Dao/Way** yet **without ruin or harm**,\nTheir **benevolence has not yet perished**, their **righteousness has not yet died**.\n\nThough **benevolence has not yet perished**,\nAnd **righteousness has not yet died**,\nThe **feudal lords already disregard their ruler**—\nWhen **feudal lords disregard their ruler**,\nThe **court becomes disrespectful**,\nAnd **even if they do not rebel**, they **do not obey**.\n\nWhen **benevolence perishes** and **righteousness dies**,\nThe **feudal lords rebel**,\nThe **common people seize governance**,\nThe **strong oppress the weak**,\nThe **great invade the small**,\nAnd **the people make warfare their profession**—\nDisasters **arise**, calamities **begin**,\nTheir **ruin is imminent**—\nHow can they **hope to avoid calamity**?\n\nThe **ancients who governed the world**,\n**Virtue/power and Dao/Way declined** while **benevolence and righteousness took precedence**,\nWhen **benevolence and righteousness declined**, **calamities and wars arose**.\n\nIn the **earliest ages**, **successive rulers** like **Jie and Zhou**,\nThough their **states were not yet ruined**,\nThe **feudal lords already held disrespectful thoughts**,\nThen **virtue/power and Dao/Way were lost**,\nAnd **benevolence and righteousness declined**.\n\nThus, **Tang and Wu arose** and **cut off the Xia and Shang**,\nAnd **the Kings You and Li of Zhou** were like **Jie and Zhou**—\nOnly **a slight difference in talent**,\nSo they **could not escape** the **great slaughter of war**,\nOr the **death at Mount Li**—\nThe **feudal lords seized governance**,\nThe **strong oppressed the weak**,\nThe **great invaded the small**,\nThe **Six States followed the balance**,\nAnd **Zhou perished with them**—\nIs this not **a warning**?\n\n**Laozi** said:\n**\"When laws are excessive and punishments severe**,\nThe people **will deceive**,\n**When the ruler acts excessively**, the people **will act deceitfully**,\n**When demands are many**, **rewards will be few**,\n**When prohibitions are many**, **success will be little**,\n**Using affairs to create more affairs**,\nAnd **again using affairs to stop affairs**—\nLike **stoking a fire and hoping it will not burn**;\n\n**Using wisdom to create troubles**,\nAnd **again using wisdom to guard against them**—\nLike **stirring water and hoping it will remain clear**.\"\n**Laws are originally for seeking**,\nBut **excessive governance brings chaos**;\n\n「Punishments are originally for restraint,\nYet harsh severity will breed deceit.\n\nIf the ruler acts excessively and yet expects the people to be free of affairs,\nThis is like forcing a man to drink and then blaming him for being drunk—\nIt is to blind the people.\n\nHow can this be called governance?\n\n**Laozi** said:\nWhen the sovereign favors **virtue/ren**,\nThen the unworthy are rewarded and the guilty are pardoned;\nWhen he favors punishments,\nThen the worthy are ruined and the innocent are condemned.\n\nTo neither favor nor hate,\nHe executes punishment without resentment and bestows rewards without expecting gratitude—\nHe lets the measure flow and the line guide itself,\nUninvolved in affairs, like Heaven and Earth—\nHow could he not cover and load all under his rule?\n\nTo unify and harmonize,\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of the sovereign;\nTo separate and execute,\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of the law.\n\nWhen the people receive punishment without grievance,\nThis is called **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**.\n\nTo favor **virtue/ren** yet not know how to govern,\nTo reward the unworthy and pardon the guilty—\nThis can still harm governance.\n\nTo favor punishments yet not know how to apply the law,\nTo ruin the worthy and execute the innocent—\nThe harm is profound indeed.\n\nOnly when justice is absolute and impartial,\nAligning with **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nRewards are not squandered and punishments are not cruel,\nThen all officials fulfill their duties and the people embrace their labors,\nAnd the realm thrives in perfect balance.\n\n**Laozi** said:\nThe world’s right and wrong have no fixed standard,\nEach age upholds what it likes and rejects what it dislikes.\nThose who seek what is right\nDo not seek **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nBut what aligns with themselves.\nTo reject what is wrong\nIs not to reject evil,\nBut to reject what opposes the heart.\n\nNow, if I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,\nTo choose what is wrong and discard it,\nI do not know what the world calls right and wrong.\n\nHence, governing a great state is like poaching small fish—\nDo not stir them, lest they spoil.\n\nTo pursue what aligns with others,\nIf words are true yet actions grow distant,\nOr if the body is near yet plans are made from afar—\nThis will surely invite suspicion.\n\nNow, if I wish to correct myself and await the responses of others,\nHow can I know what the world will use to measure me?\n\nIf I rush along with the customs,\nI am like one fleeing the rain—\nThere is no place untouched by dampness.\n\nTo desire emptiness yet fail to embody it,\nOr to not seek emptiness yet naturally attain it—\nThis is what one desires and will surely achieve.\n\nThus, those who grasp the **Dao/Way**,\nLike a cart axle that does not move itself,\nYet with the wheel reaches a thousand miles,\nTurning through endless plains—\n\nHence, the sage embodies the **Dao/Way** and returns to its origin,\nDoes not act to transform but waits for transformation,\nMoves yet does nothing—\n\nThe distinctions of names and ranks, the debates of right and wrong,\nThe separation of good and evil—\nThese are the **Dao/Way** of governance,\nNot seeking absolute justice but taking one’s own perspective.\n\nTo call wrong right and evil good,\nYet hope for names and ranks to be correct and laws to be clear—\nThis is difficult indeed.\n\nOnly when one corrects oneself and awaits the responses of others,\nWithout abandoning absolute justice,\nThen, like a cart on land or a boat on water,\nOne travels without obstruction—\nHow could there be any falling into imbalance?\n\n**Laozi** said:\nHe who often wages war and frequently wins,\nHis state shall perish.\nOften waging war exhausts the people,\nFrequent victories breed arrogance in the ruler—\nWith an arrogant ruler leading exhausted people,\nHow could his state not perish?\n\nWhen the ruler is arrogant, he grows reckless,\nRecklessness leads to exhausting the people,\nWhen the people are exhausted, they harbor resentment,\nResentment leads to extreme measures—\nIf both ruler and people reach extremes yet the state does not perish,\nThis has never occurred.\n\nThus, when achievements are complete, the ruler retires—\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nVictories are not constant; defeat follows—\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of reversals.\nHow can one seek frequent victories in war?\n\nWhen the ruler prevails yet grows arrogant,\nAnd the people are exhausted yet still wage war—\nThe axe of ruin for his state.\n\nWar is like fire—\nIf not restrained, it will burn itself out.\nIs this not a warning?\n\nKing Ping asked Wenzi:\nI have heard that you learned the **Dao/Way** from Lao Dan.\nEven if the wise have the **Dao/Way**,\nYet encounter an age of licentious chaos,\nWith the authority of one man,\nHow could they transform the people who have long been in disorder?\n\nWenzi replied:\n**Virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nRectify evil to establish what is right,\nStabilize chaos to bring order,\nTransform licentiousness and decay into simplicity—\nPure **virtue/power** revives,\nAnd the world is at peace.\nThis depends on one person.\n\nThe sovereign is the teacher of the people,\nThe ruler is the model for the subjects.\nIf the ruler is beautiful, the people will emulate beauty,\nIf the ruler has **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nThen the people will have **virtue/ren** and **righteousness**,\nAnd if the people have **virtue/ren** and **righteousness**,\nThen there will be no age of licentious chaos.\n\nAccumulating **virtue/power** leads to kingship,\nAccumulating resentment leads to ruin,\nPiling stones forms mountains,\nGathering water forms seas—\nWithout accumulation, how could anything be achieved?\n\nThose who accumulate **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nHeaven aids them, Earth assists them,\nGhosts and spirits support them,\nPhoenix birds hover in their courts,\nQilin roam their outskirts,\nQiantong dragons dwell in their marshes.\n\nThus, to rule the world with the **Dao/Way**,\nIs to embody the world’s **virtue/power**;\nTo rule the world without the **Dao/Way**,\nIs to become the world’s thief.\n\nTo make the world your enemy with one man’s power,\nEven if you desire longevity, it cannot be attained.\n\nEmperor Yao and Shun flourished through this,\nKing Jie and Zhou’s last tyrant perished through this.\n\nKing Ping said:\nI respectfully hear your words.\n\nWenzi, from the family of Ji, lived near Bo,\nLong studied under Laozi,\nAnd upon hearing the **Dao/Way**, became widely learned.\nKing Ping invited him and asked about the **Dao/Way**,\nWenzi answered with *accumulating virtue leads to kingship, accumulating resentment leads to ruin*.\nEmperor Yao and Shun flourished through this,\nKing Jie and Zhou’s last tyrant perished through this.\n\nKing Ping said:\nI respectfully hear your words.\n\nBy this standard,\nIf King Ping had resolve to govern,\nWhy did he not cultivate **virtue/power** and pardon resentment,\nYet instead he trusted slander and harbored suspicion,\nAnd executed the Wu clan?\nThis is why Wenzi left Chu for Yue.\n\nZi Chu urged Wu to attack Chu,\nAnd suffered the humiliation of being flogged after death—\nGreat indeed.\n\nRulers of states,\nCan resentment not be pardoned?\n\n*(End of the fifth chapter of *The True Classic of the Mysterious Origin*, annotated with the following notes from the *Jizhen Edition*:\n#1 After this sentence: *\"Thus, the brave who dare are slain, the brave who do not dare are spared.\"*\n#2 *\"志得\"* (Zhìdé) is *\"至德\"* (Zhìdé) in the *Jizhen Edition*.\n#3 *\"执一者见小也\"*

Master Du Daojian of Nangu Valley**\n\n**Laozi says:**\nThe ruler is the heart of the state.\nWhen the heart is ordered, all limbs are at ease;\nWhen the heart is disturbed, all limbs are in chaos.\n\nThus, when one’s own person is ordered,\nThe limbs support one another;\nWhen a state is ordered,\nThe ruler and ministers forget their distinctions.\n\n**Virtue is singular yet twofold:**\nNurturing all things is the **virtue/power** of Heaven,\nCherishing the people is the **virtue/power** of the ruler.\n\nThe ruler is the heart of the state—\nWhen the ruler has **virtue/power**, the heart expands, the body grows robust,\n**Qi** remains unruffled, and the person governs itself.\nTo govern a state is like governing one’s own person—\nWhen ruler and ministers are at ease,\nHow could the state fail to be ordered?\n\nThus it is said:\n*The Upper Virtue does not cling to virtue,*\nYet this is virtue—\nNot boasting of it as virtue,\nYet truly possessing it.\n\n**Laozi says:**\nHe learned from Changcong,\nObserving the tongue yet guarding softness,\nGazing upward at the house’s rafters,\nRetreating to gaze upon the river,\nStudying his shadow to know how to follow behind—\nThus the sage abides in emptiness and follows,\nEver yielding yet never leading,\nLike kindling piled—\nThe fire that burns last stands highest.\n\nChangcong was a sage of antiquity.\nLaozi learned from Changcong,\nAs Confucius learned from Laozi.\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is seen, the spirit resonates in harmony—\nThus he could observe the tongue and guard softness.\nStudying his shadow to know how to follow behind,\nThe sage thus follows in emptiness and non-action,\nNot contending, not daring to lead—\nThis is called *Upper Virtue*.\n\n**Laozi says:**\nA clanging bell destroys itself with sound,\nA candle consumes itself with light.\nThe tiger’s stripes invite arrows,\nThe monkey’s agility invites confrontation—\nThus the bold die by their strength,\nThe eloquent are ensnared by their cleverness,\nKnowing through cleverness yet failing to know *not* knowing through cleverness.\n\nThus, those skilled in one ability,\nSharp in one argument,\nCan be led by devious speech,\nYet cannot be broadly responded to.\nWhat is noble is to have **virtue/power**,\nNot to have much cleverness.\nExcessive cleverness issues from oneself\nAnd returns upon itself—\nFew escape self-harm.\nThe tiger’s stripes invite arrows,\nThe monkey’s agility invites confrontation—\nThe scholar’s boldness dies by strength,\nHis cleverness is ensnared by eloquence—\nThis is as it should be.\n\nOnly those who do not know through cleverness\nYet know *not* knowing through cleverness\nAre not confined to one thing,\nAnd their responses are broad.\n\n**Laozi says:**\nThe **Dao/Way** is formless in its essence—\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be heard—\nCalled *profound and obscure*.\n*Profound and obscure* is how the **Dao/Way** is spoken of,\nYet it is not the **Dao/Way** itself.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is inward reflection—\nThus one does not slightly awaken,\nNor greatly delude,\nNor slightly enlighten,\nNor greatly dull.\nOne does not discern in flowing waters,\nBut discerns in still pools—\nFor its essence is inwardly preserved, still, and not externally agitated.\n\nThe moon wanes when the sun is full—\nYin cannot sustain yang.\nWhen the sun rises, stars vanish—\nThey cannot contend for brightness.\nThe end cannot overpower the root,\nThe branch cannot exceed the trunk.\nWhat is above is heavy, what is below is light—\nIts overturning is inevitable.\n\nOne pool does not hold two dragons,\nOne female does not mate with two males—\nOne is fixed; two contend.\nJade in the mountains makes grasses and trees lush,\nPearls in the depths keep the shores from withering.\nThe earthworm, lacking strong bones or sharp claws,\nEats the withered above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below—\nIts **qi** is singular.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is formless in its essence—\nThus it can move in parallel.\nThings, with form as their function,\nCannot coexist.\nFormless in essence, it is singular and fixed.\nWith form as function, they are dual and contend.\n\nYet there are degrees of great and small,\nDistinctions of ruler and minister.\nWhen the ruler embraces the **Dao/Way** and holds **virtue/power**,\nHe does not claim possession of it—\nThis is why the **Dao/Way** is vast,\nAnd **virtue/power** endures.\n\nWho dares contend with strength?\nClarity as brightness—\nA cup of water reveals the pupil.\nTurbidity as harm—\nThe Yellow River obscures Mount Tai.\nOrchids and osmanthus need no praise to be fragrant;\nA boat floats on rivers and seas—\nIt does not sink for want of riders.\nThe gentleman walks the **Dao/Way**—\nHe does not halt for want of recognition.\nThis is the nature of things.\n\nTo enter purity from impurity is to invite constraint and humiliation;\nTo enter impurity from purity is to invite ruin.\nHeaven’s two **qi** form the rainbow,\nEarth’s two **qi** cause leakage and concealment,\nMan’s two **qi** bring illness.\nYin and yang cannot persist—\nNow winter, now summer;\nThe moon does not know day,\nThe sun does not know night.\n\nWide rivers breed great fish,\nTall mountains grow towering trees,\nBroad lands nurture deep **virtue/power**.\n\nThus fish cannot be caught without bait,\nBeasts cannot be summoned without traps.\nMountains harbor fierce beasts—\nThe forests are left uncut;\nGardens harbor venomous insects—\nThe melons and hemp are left unharvested;\nStates have worthy ministers—\nThey resolve conflicts a thousand *li* away.\n\nThose who master the Dao move like a wheel turning in its hub—\nnot driven by themselves, yet carrying all to a thousand *li*,\nending only to begin anew, revolving in the boundless source.\n\nThus, to raise the crooked alongside the straight—\nwhat difference does it make?\nTo raise the straight alongside the crooked—\ndo not comply.\n\nClear water mirrors shadows,\na clear mind discerns all things—\nthis is the nature of illumination.\nWhen muddied, it grows dim.\n\nThe virtuous and the petty cannot coexist—\ntheir forces cannot stand together.\nWinter’s cold and summer’s heat do not run concurrently—\nif they do, calamities arise.\nIf forces clash, misfortune follows.\n\nYet though the petty may hold office,\nshould the virtuous withdraw because the Dao cannot be practiced?\nThere is a bird about to arrive—\nset the net and await it.\nHe who catches the bird is the one who set the net’s eye.\n\nIf you set a net for one eye,\nyou will never catch a bird.\nThus some matters cannot be preordained,\nsome things cannot be foreseen.\nHence the Sage nurtures the Dao and waits for the time.\n\nTo catch fish, first clear the valley;\nto summon birds, first grow the trees.\nWater gathers, fish assemble;\ntrees flourish, birds congregate.\nThose who catch fish do not drag them from the depths,\nthose who catch monkeys do not carry them up the trees—\nthey simply let them come where they are drawn.\n\nThe path you tread is shallow,\nyet you must wait for what you do not tread to move forward.\nThe mind’s knowledge is limited,\nyet you must wait for what it does not know to become clear.\n\nWhen rivers dry, valleys empty;\nwhen hills level, abysses fill.\nWhen lips perish, teeth grow cold.\nWhen the Yellow River’s waters recede,\nthe land lies bare upon the mountains.\n\nStill water becomes clear,\nclear water becomes level,\nlevel water reveals all forms—\nforms cannot coexist,\nthus they can be measured.\n\nTo know the use of what is useful,\nyet not know the use of what is useless—\nsuch a one cannot speak of governance.\n\nTo govern a state depends on one person;\nwithout one, many cannot rule.\nTo seek worthy ministers without first nurturing scholars—\nis this possible?\n\nThus the Sage nurtures the Dao and waits for the time.\nWhen worthy men arise, none refuse to serve.\nWhat makes leaves fall? The wind shakes them.\nWhat makes water murky? Things disturb it.\nA jade’s smoothness comes from the whetstone’s work,\na blade’s sharpness comes from the grindstone’s force.\nThe gnat and the steed both travel a thousand *li*—\nyet the gnat does not fly,\nthe steed lacks provisions and does not starve.\n\nWhen the clever hare is caught, the hunting dogs are boiled;\nwhen the high birds are exhausted, the fine bows are hidden.\nSuccess brings retreat—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nAnger arises from what is not anger,\naction comes from what is not action.\nTo see what is unseen,\nto hear what is unheard—\nthen you perceive what is seen,\nthen you hear what is heard.\n\nBirds return to their nests,\nhares flee to their burrows,\nfoxes die on their birth mounds,\ncicadas cling to trees—\neach returns to its origin.\n\nThe Dao can be walked alone,\nbut affairs cannot be monopolized.\n\nA man may run a hundred *li* and then tire,\nbut with a good horse, a thousand *li* is possible.\nAnger from what is not anger—\nthus Wen and Wu brought peace to the people.\nAction from what is not action—\nthus Yao and Shun established the age of settled governance.\n\nIf a ruler governs well and uses men wisely,\nwho among the people would not return to him?\n\nFire and water repel each other,\nyet the cauldron mediates between them.\nThe five flavors blend—\nbone and flesh love each other,\nyet slanderers intervene,\nand father and son become endangered.\n\nDogs and pigs eat without discrimination,\ngrowing ever fatter—\nyet they approach death.\n\nThe phoenix soars to the heights, yet none can summon it;\nthe axe’s blade is fixed to its handle, yet it cannot strike itself.\nThe eye sees a hundred paces away,\nyet cannot see its own corner.\n\nBuild high and it becomes a mountain—\nstable and not precarious.\nBuild low and it becomes a marsh—\nfish and turtles gather there.\n\nDitches overflow in floods,\ndry up in droughts.\nThe Yellow River’s source is deep and never exhausted.\n\nThe deaf lack ears, yet their eyes cannot be covered—\nthey are precise in sight.\nThe blind lack eyes, yet their ears cannot be covered—\nthey are precise in hearing.\n\nMuddy water can wash my feet,\nbut clear water can wash my headgear.\nSilk begins as raw silk—\nsometimes it becomes a cap,\nsometimes a belt.\nThe cap is worn on the head,\nthe belt is wrapped around the feet.\n\nNo man is always right,\nno thing is always wrong.\nQi in harmony unites,\nqi in conflict separates.\n\nFire ascends, water descends—\nthe cauldron mediates between them,\nand its function is fulfilled.\n\nIf the father is kind and the son dutiful,\nyet slanderers intervene,\nthen the grudges of the Big Dipper and the Southern Cross arise.\n\nDogs and pigs grow fat and approach death,\nthe phoenix soars high and none can summon it.\n\nClear water washes the headgear,\nmuddy water washes the feet—\nif one cannot purify oneself,\nyet blames others for filth,\nshould this not be examined?\n\nGold’s nature overcomes wood—\none blade cannot harm an entire forest.\nEarth’s nature overcomes water—\none handful cannot dam a river.\nWater’s nature overcomes fire—\none sip cannot extinguish a cartload of firewood.\n\nWinter thunder, summer hail—\ncold and heat do not alter their course.\nFrost and snow fall thickly,\nyet melt at dawn.\n\nTo tilt is to risk falling,\nto lean is to risk toppling,\nto assist is to risk overreaching,\nto moisten is to risk rain.\n\nOrchids and osmanthus bloom fragrant,\nyet cannot endure frost.\nToads avoid weapons,\ntheir lifespan ends at the fifth month’s full moon.\n\nWhen essence is wasted, the body weakens,\nwhen flowers bloom out of season, they cannot be eaten.\n\nGeneration and destruction, restraint and domination—\neach has its fixed portion.\nTo bear great burdens with little strength\nis to invite reversal and subjugation.\n\nWood overcomes metal,\nwater overcomes earth,\nfire overcomes water—\nyet this is not their inherent nature.\n\nWinter thunder, summer hail—\nthese are not their proper times.\nEven a morning’s duration is brief—\nhow can one not measure oneself?\n\nThe tongue against the teeth—\nwhich wears first?\nThe bowstring against the arrow—\nwhich snaps first?\n\nWhat bends the shadow is the form,\nwhat muddies the echo is the sound.\n\nTo treat the dying as the sick—\nthis is difficult for a good physician.\nTo counsel the doomed as the living—\nthis is impossible for loyal advisors.\n\nThe one who makes the flute play and the artisan refine the pipes—\nthough they follow the proper rhythm, they cannot make the music resound.\nThe ruler’s form is lost when they are constrained.\n\nThe deaf cannot sing to find joy,\nthe blind cannot observe to engage with others.\nOne who walks in the forest cannot follow a straight path,\nand one who travels in peril cannot step on a plumb line.\n\nThe sea produces great things,\nyet when placed in an unsuitable land or dependent on the wrong people,\nit is difficult indeed.\n\nThe rigid tooth breaks first,\nthe stiff arrow snaps first.\n\nTo treat the dying as the sick—\nthis is difficult for a good physician.\nTo counsel the doomed as the living—\nthis is impossible for loyal advisors.\n\nIf the ruler does not follow the Dao,\nyet the minister forces it upon him,\nwith schemes born of divided hearts—\nhow can success be achieved?\n\nThe sun does not rise in pairs,\nthe fox does not have two kings,\nthe divine dragon does not mate,\nthe fierce beast does not gather in herds,\nthe ravenous crow does not fly in twos.\n\nWithout the handle, the parasol cannot shield,\nwithout the axle, the wheel cannot chase swiftness—\nyet even a well-made parasol and wheel are not enough to rely upon.\n\nTo draw the bow and shoot—\nwithout the string, the arrow cannot fly,\nand the act of releasing the arrow is but one-tenth of the skill of shooting.\n\nA hungry horse in the stable makes no sound,\nbut when fodder is placed beside it,\nthe struggle for it begins.\n\nA three-inch pipe cannot hold the wind,\nyet the heavens cannot be filled.\nA ten-stone vessel may overflow,\nbut a hundred dou is sufficient.\n\nIf one cuts along the plumb line, it will not stray,\nif one weighs with the balance, it will not err.\nTo apply ancient laws by analogy—\nsometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail.\nThe use of standards and measures—\nsometimes they are applied, sometimes not.\nTo act rightly is called discernment;\nto act wrongly is called chaos.\n\nThe sun does not rise in pairs,\nthe divine dragon does not mate,\nthe fierce beast does not gather in herds—\nhow much more so for humans?\n\nThe handle stretches the canopy,\nthe axle turns the wheel—\nthis is the Dao of ruler and minister aiding each other.\n\nA hungry horse struggles for fodder;\nrewards must not be given recklessly.\nTo cut along the plumb line is to judge without error;\nancient laws and standards must be applied at the proper time—\nit depends on those who wield them.\n\nThe farmer labors while the noble is nourished;\nthe foolish speak while the wise choose.\n\nWhen things are clear before one,\ntreat them as jade and stone—\nwhen they are obscure,\nkeep their counsel.\nA hundred stars’ light\nis not as bright as one moon’s,\nand ten windows open\nare not as bright as one door.\n\nThe viper cannot be a foot,\nthe tiger cannot be a wing.\n\nNow, if one has a six-foot mat,\nlying down, one can easily step over it,\nbut standing, even the most skilled cannot leap over it—\nthe application of force differs.\n\nThe assistant at sacrifice gets to taste,\nthe one who breaks up a fight gets injured,\nand he who shelters beneath an unlucky tree\nmay be struck by thunder and lightning.\n\nThe sun and moon wish to shine,\nyet floating clouds obscure them;\nthe river wishes to be clear,\nyet sand and mud defile it;\nthe clump of orchids wishes to flourish,\nyet autumn winds wither them;\nhuman nature wishes to be balanced,\nyet desires corrupt it.\nTo walk through dust and yet avoid being stained—\nthis is impossible.\n\nA golden tortoise pendant,\nthe worthy wear as an ornament;\nfertile soil spread across the land,\nthe capable use to grow rich.\n\nThus, to give gold and jade to the weak\nis not as good as giving them a simple scroll.\n\nIf the farmer does not labor,\nthe noble has no means to be nourished.\nIf the noble does not govern,\nhow can the farmer be at peace?\n\nThe serpent has no feet,\nthe tiger has no wings—\none cannot have both.\n\nFloating clouds obscure the sun—\nthe fault lies not with oneself.\nDesires corrupt nature—\nthe illness is not of the person.\n\nA hollow hub stands with thirty spokes,\neach pulling straight toward its notch,\nyet if one spoke alone were to enter,\nall others would be abandoned—\nhow could it reach near or far?\n\nCitrons grow in their native soil,\nreeds grow in their clumps,\nbeasts with similar feet gather to roam,\nbirds with similar wings gather to soar.\n\nTo observe all nine regions of the land\nwithout a thousand-li journey,\nwithout the source of governance and teaching,\nand yet wish to rule the people—\nthis is difficult.\n\nThe cunning gain their prey,\nthe swift strike their mark.\n\nThus, great whiteness seems like shame,\nvast virtue seems like insufficiency.\n\nThe noble has wine,\nthe petty man beats his pot—\nthough it may not be praised,\nit can still be despised.\n\nThe Supreme Polarity stands at the center,\nrelying on the eight ministers before it can be established.\nThe hub of the wheel is hollow within,\ndepending on the spokes before it can move.\n\nThe Son of Heaven stands at the center of the world,\nplaced above all people,\nyet without the source of governance and teaching,\nhow can he rule?\nOnly by maintaining proper position and dignity,\nwith officials fulfilling their roles,\ncan the realm be governed without descending from the hall.\n\nHuman nature prefers loose clothing and hanging silks,\nyet when threatened, one immediately dons armor—\nthis is to abandon what is inconvenient\nfor what is advantageous.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub,\neach straight toward its notch,\nyet none can enter another—\njust as ministers each guard their duties.\n\nThe skilled user of people is like the insect’s feet,\nmany yet not harming one another,\nlike the tongue and teeth,\nfirm and soft, grinding yet not destroying.\n\nStone is born firm,\norchid is born fragrant—\nif held young, their virtue grows clearer with time.\n\nTo support and to lift,\nto decline and to yield,\nto gain and to lose,\nto assent and to refuse—\nthese differ by thousands of miles.\n\nThere is a method to every action,\nand nothing fails to succeed.\nThere is a way to use people,\nand none are beyond aid.\n\nThe spokes of the wheel each align with their notch,\nillustrating how officials must each hold their posts.\n\nThough the insect’s feet are many, they do not harm one another—\nthis is because they are used appropriately.\n\nStone is firm, orchid is fragrant—\nif each is used according to its nature,\nthen the wise become clear,\nthe strong become powerful,\nand success is achieved.\n\nThe twice-born do not gain,\nflowers that bloom too early fall without frost.\n\nTo soil the standard,\nto powder the brow,\nto have a rotting rat beneath the ancestral altar,\nto be choked by smoke in the hall—\nto enter water and hate being wet,\nto embrace stench and seek fragrance—\neven the most skilled cannot craft perfection.\n\nWinter ice can be shattered,\nsummer wood can be bound—\nopportune moments are hard to find yet easy to lose.\n\nWhen wood is in full vigor,\none can cut it all day and it regrows,\nbut when autumn frost descends,\nit withers in a single night.\n\nWhen the target is taut and the arrow is drawn,\nwhen forests are dense and axes enter—\nthis is not summoned by will,\nbut by the nature of things.\n\nA nursing puppy bites a tiger,\na crouching hen strikes a weasel—\nwhen favor is bestowed,\nit does not measure their strength.\n\nThose who wait for profit to rescue the drowning will surely drown them with their own greed.\nA boat can float or sink—fools do not know where to draw the line.\n\nA swift steed urged forward will not advance,\npulled back will not stop—\na ruler who does not seek the Dao in governance\nwill find no steady path.\n\nOpportune moments are hard to grasp yet easy to lose,\nthe people easily fall into hardship but rarely recover.\n\nThus, things that regenerate cannot be fully seized,\nflowers that bloom too early fall without frost—\nthe times are not favorable.\n\nWhen the target is taut and the arrow is drawn,\nwhen forests are dense and axes enter—\nthis is the work of circumstance.\n\nA nursing puppy bites a tiger,\na crouching hen strikes a weasel—\ndriven by instinct, not strength.\n\nA rotting boat still carries its load,\na weary steed driven to death—\ncan the people endure further suffering?\n\nWater, though level, must have waves,\na balance, though true, must have slight deviation,\na ruler’s measure, though precise, must have flaws.\n\nWithout the compass and square, one cannot define the square and round,\nwithout the plumb line and level, one cannot rectify the crooked and straight.\nYet even those who use the compass and square\nmust have the mind to wield them rightly.\n\nTai Mountain’s height, doubled, is still unseen,\nyet the finest autumn hair can be discerned—\nso too with hidden truths.\n\nFire in bamboo does not ignite without kindling,\nwater in the earth does not emerge without digging.\nAn arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*,\nyet a limping tortoise, step by step, crosses a thousand.\n\nHeap soil without end, and hills will rise.\nStand by the river wanting fish—\nbetter to return and weave nets.\n\nA bow must first be tuned before seeking strength,\na horse must first be broken before seeking excellence,\na man must first earn trust before seeking skill.\n\nA master smith cannot melt wood,\na skilled artisan cannot cleave ice—\nsome things defy effort.\nHow can the virtuous not take heed?\n\nIf men cannot cross the river,\nyou cannot force the river to stand still.\nIf a pot does not say it is guiltless,\nit will not fall into the well.\n\nWater, though level, must have waves,\na balance, though true, must have deviation—\nhow much more must the heart be cautious?\n\nThe gentleman’s rites and propriety,\nlike the craftsman’s compass and square,\nare tools to measure conduct.\n\nA bow must first be tuned before seeking strength,\na horse must first be broken before seeking excellence.\nIf a man is not first trusted,\nhow can his skill be summoned?\n\nThus the gentleman acts only as he can,\nand does not act where he cannot prevail.\n\nThose who reproach my conduct seek my company,\nthose who praise my goods seek my trade—\na single chess move does not reveal wisdom,\na single plucked string does not stir sorrow.\n\nNow take a burning ember—\ntouch it, and your fingers blister,\nyet stand ten paces away, and you are unharmed.\nLike qi gathered differently, some bear glory,\nothers bear sorrow.\n\nSilk above, hemp below—\nthe high and low must align.\n\nGreat trees have deep roots,\ntall mountains have firm foundations.\nBitter words bring profit,\nbitter medicine cures disease.\n\nThose who reproach my conduct seek my company—\nthe gentleman follows righteousness.\nThose who praise my goods seek my trade—\nthe petty man follows profit.\n\nMan’s fortune cannot be excessive—\nclothing need not be extravagant.\nGreat trees have deep roots,\ntall mountains have firm foundations—\nwhen the people prosper, the state flourishes.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\nA drum does not store sound, yet it makes sound.\nA mirror does not hold form, yet it reflects form.\nMetal and stone make sound only when struck,\nflutes and pipes make music only when blown.\n\nThus the sage holds inward, does not lead others,\nresponds when things come, answers when things arrive.\nHeaven’s motion never ceases,\nyet it returns to its beginning—\nthus it endures.\n\nA wheel turns where it should,\nthus it travels far.\nHeaven’s motion never strays—\nthus there is no excess.\n\nHeaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends,\nyin and yang intermingle—\nall things are harmonized.\nWhen the gentleman acts, the petty man fades—\nthis is the Way of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen Heaven’s qi does not descend,\nearth’s qi does not ascend,\nyin and yang do not flow—\nall things wither.\nThe petty man gains power,\nthe gentleman fades,\nthe five grains do not grow,\nvirtue is hidden within.\n\nThe Way of Heaven: it gathers the abundant and aids the scarce.\nThe Way of Earth: it reduces the high and raises the low.\nThe Way of Spirits: it humbles the proud and exalts the lowly.\nThe Way of Man: the many do not share.\nThe Way of the Sage: though low, none can surpass him.\n\nThe heart that does not store things can respond to things,\nthe drum that does not store sound can answer sound—\nif it rings without being struck, it is unnatural.\n\nThus the sage holds inward, does not lead others,\nbut responds as needed.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth intermingle,\nall things are harmonized—\nthis is the time of bright gatherings,\nwhen the gentleman acts and thrives.\n\nIf one reverses this,\nthen it is the petty man’s day.\n\nOnly the sage stands high while listening low,\nyet does not grow full of himself,\nand does not seek to rise above.\n\nWhen Heaven is bright, the sun shines,\nand only then can it illuminate the four quarters.\nWhen the ruler is enlightened, the ministers are enlightened,\nand only then is the realm at peace.\nWhen the realm has four enlightened corners,\nonly then can it endure.\n\nTo enlighten those who enlighten others—\nthis is to enlighten their transformations.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is *wen* (pattern),\nthe Way of Earth is *li* (principle),\none unites them in harmony,\ntime governs their work—\nthus all things are completed.\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is broad and near—\ncultivate it in oneself, and virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in things, and virtue is unbroken.\n\nHeaven covers all things,\nbestowing virtue and nourishing them,\ngiving without taking—\nthus all things return to their spirit.\n\nTo give without taking is the highest virtue—\nthus it is called virtue.\n\nNothing is higher than Heaven,\nnothing is lower than the marsh.\nHeaven is high, the marsh is low—\nthe sage follows this,\nand order is established.\n\nEarth bears all things and sustains them,\ngiving and taking—\nthus bones and flesh return to it.\n\nTo give and take is the lower virtue—\nyet even the lower virtue, if not lost,\nis still virtue.\n\nEarth supports Heaven, thus it is stable.\nEarth is stable, thus all things take form.\nEarth is vast and thick, thus all things gather.\nStable and thick, it bears all things,\nvast and deep, it contains all things.\n\nEarth’s foundation is deep and firm,\nthus waters gather within.\nEarth’s Way is square and broad,\nthus it endures.\nThe sage follows this—\nvirtue contains all things.\n\nThe Sovereign follows the Way of Heaven,\nthe Minister follows the Way of Earth.\nHeaven is exalted, Earth is humble—\nthus the distinction between Sovereign and Minister is fixed.\n\nWhen the Sovereign is enlightened, the Minister is enlightened,\nilluminating the four quarters—\nis this not the radiance of Yao,\nwho brought clarity to all under Heaven?\n\nThus, to model Heaven and emulate Earth,\nto complete all things—\nthis is the Way.\n\nTo nourish and give without taking is the highest virtue.\nTo give and take is lower virtue indeed.\n\nYin is difficult for Yang—\nwhen all things flourish, Yang subdues Yin.\nYang serves Yin—\nall things rest in tranquility.\n\nWhen things flourish, none lack sustenance;\nwhen things rest, none lack joy.\nWhen all things rejoice, all things are well-ordered.\n\nIf Yin harms things, Yang bends in retreat;\nwhen Yin advances and Yang withdraws,\nthe petty gain influence,\nthe virtuous avoid harm—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhen Yang-qi moves, all things relax and find their place—\nthus the sage follows the Way of Yang.\n\nTo follow things, things will follow in return;\nto oppose things, things will oppose in return—\nthus one does not lose the nature of things.\n\nWhen the marshes overflow, all things grow in due measure;\nwhen the marshes dry, all things wither in due measure.\nThus, when rains fail, the land is barren and lost,\nYang ascends then descends again—\nthus it becomes the master of all things.\n\nIt does not cling to permanence,\nand so it can end and begin anew,\nend and begin anew,\nand so endure forever.\nTo endure forever,\nit becomes the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nYang-qi accumulates before it can bestow,\nYin-qi gathers before it can transform—\nnothing transforms without first accumulating.\nThus the sage is cautious in what it gathers.\n\nWhen Yang extinguishes Yin, all things grow fat;\nwhen Yin extinguishes Yang, all things wither.\nThus, when kings and lords uphold the Way of Yang,\nall things flourish;\nwhen they uphold the Way of Yin,\nall under Heaven perishes.\n\nYang does not descend to Yin—\nall things cannot form,\nthe Sovereign does not descend to the Minister—\nvirtuous transformation does not spread.\nThus, when the Sovereign descends to the Minister,\nthere is wisdom and clarity;\nwhen not, there is darkness and deafness.\n\nYang gives life, Yin brings death—\nthus the virtuous cherish life,\nthe petty embrace death.\n\nWhen kings and lords uphold the Way of Yang,\nall things flourish;\nwhen they uphold the Way of Yin,\nall under Heaven perishes.\n\nYang is noble, descending to Yin—\nthus when the Sovereign descends to the Minister,\nthere is wisdom and the nation is well-ordered;\nwhen not, there is darkness and deafness,\nand virtuous transformation does not spread.\n\nWhen the sun rises from Earth,\nall things multiply and thrive,\nkings and lords dwell above the people,\nilluminating virtue and morality.\nWhen the sun sets into Earth,\nall things rest and hide,\nthe petty dwell above the people,\nand all things flee in concealment.\n\nWhen thunder moves, all things awaken;\nwhen rain nourishes, all things are released—\nthe great act similarly.\n\nThe movement of Yin and Yang has fixed seasons,\nthe great act without exhausting things.\n\nThunder shakes the Earth, all things relax;\nwind sways the trees, grasses and woods wither.\nThe great act by abandoning vice and embracing goodness—\nthe people do not flee far,\nthus the people have choices to depart or stay.\nDeparture is more extreme,\napproach is less so.\n\nWhen wind does not move, fire does not rise,\nwhen the great do not speak, the petty have no words.\nWhen fire rises, it must await kindling;\nwhen the great speak, it must be with truth.\n\nWith truth and sincerity, what cannot succeed?\nDeep waters hold the earth,\nmounds on mountains, valleys in the lowlands—\nwhen Yang-qi is strong, it transforms into Yin;\nwhen Yin-qi is strong, it transforms into Yang.\nThus desire cannot be fully satisfied,\njoy cannot be fully indulged.\n\nAnger without harsh words,\nwrath without color—\nthis is called calculated gain.\n\nFire ascends in flame, water flows downward—\nthe sage’s Way seeks its kind:\nthe sage embraces Yang, bringing harmony to all under Heaven;\nthe sage embraces Yin, drowning all under Heaven.\n\nIs Heaven’s sun the people’s Sovereign?\nWhen the sun rises from Earth,\nkings and lords dwell above the people,\nall things multiply and thrive.\nWhen the sun sets into Earth,\nthe petty dwell above the people,\nall things flee in concealment.\n\nThe movement of Yin and Yang has fixed seasons,\nthus the year does not disrupt its times.\nThe great act without exhausting things,\nthus the people do not flee far.\n\nThings pushed to extremes transform—\ndesire cannot be fully satisfied.\n\nYin and Yang are Heaven’s—\norder and chaos depend on humanity.\n\nLaozi said:\nThin accumulations become thick,\nlow accumulations become high.\nThe virtuous strive daily to achieve brilliance,\nthe petty rush daily to reach disgrace.\n\nThough unseen in its waxing and waning,\nthus one pursues goodness as if it might slip away,\nand past evils as if they were omens of ruin.\nIf one turns toward goodness,\neven past mistakes bring no blame;\nif one does not turn toward goodness,\neven loyalty cannot avert calamity.\nThus blaming others is not as good as blaming oneself;\nseeking faults in others is not as good as seeking them within.\n\nSounds are self-summoned,\nkinds seek their own,\nnames are self-claimed,\npositions are self-assumed—\nnone of it is without cause.\n\nWielding sharpness to pierce,\nwielding blades to strike—\nwhy blame others?\n\nThus the virtuous are cautious of trifles.\n\nAll things bear Yin and embrace Yang,\nconverging qi to form harmony.\nHarmony resides at the center—\nthus grains grow in the heart of wood,\nseeds in the pods of grass,\neggs and embryos in the center,\nthose without eggs or embryos\ntake time to gestate.\n\nWhen Earth is level, water does not flow;\nwhen light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt—\nthe generation and transformation of things\nare moved by response.\n\nYin and Yang respond to form harmony.\nThus all things are born,\nSovereign and Minister unite in the Middle Way—\nthus all the people are at peace.\n\nTherefore the virtuous harmonize their heart-mind,\nstriving daily to achieve brilliance.\nThe petty drown in Heaven’s harmony,\nrushing daily to reach disgrace.\n\nThus the virtuous are cautious of trifles,\nrectifying their hearts and seeking within themselves.\nIf I do not blame others,\nothers will not blame me—\nis this not so?\n\nLaozi said:\nMountains reach their height,\nand clouds and rains arise there.\nWaters reach their depth,\nand dragons and serpents are born.\nThe virtuous perfect their Way,\nand virtue flows forth.\n\nThose with hidden virtue\nwill surely have manifest reward,\nthose with secret deeds\nwill surely have renowned name.\nPlanting millet does not yield barley,\nplanting resentment yields no gratitude.\nTo do good unseen is the highest good.\nTo do evil unseen is the highest evil.\n\nMountains conceal clouds to form rain and dew,\nmarshes conceal waters to birth dragons and serpents—\nthe virtuous harbor their Way,\nand its blessings flow to the world.\n\nThose with hidden virtue will surely have manifest reward—this is the blessing of Heaven.\nThose with secret deeds will surely have renowned name—this is the esteem of humanity.\nOnly those with Heaven’s virtue know it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Continuation of the *True Scripture of the Perfected Dao*), Compiled by Master Du Daojian of Nangu, *Weiming* (\"Mystic Clarity\")**\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao can be weak, yet strong,\nsoft, yet firm,\nshadowed, yet bright,\nenfolding yet expansive,\nresponding without fixed measure.\nShallow knowledge grasps its surface,\ndeep knowledge penetrates its core.\nCoarse knowledge clings to its form,\nrefined knowledge perceives its essence.\nYet what is known as knowledge is ignorance,\nand what is unknown as ignorance is true knowledge.\nWho can fathom the formless form?\n\nThus all under Heaven know that goodness is goodness—\nyet this is not true goodness.\nThe wise do not speak,\nspeakers lack wisdom.\nThe mystically bright—\nthis is the Dao.\n\nSee not with the eyes,\nhear not with the ears,\nbut grasp it from Heaven and root it in the heart—\nthus one can enfold Heaven and Earth,\nrespond without fixed measure,\nnot by cleverness or forceful seeking.\nOnly by knowing what is not known,\nacting without contrivance,\nspeaking without words\ndoes one attain it.\n\nWenzi asked:\nCan one speak of the Dao in subtle ways?\nLaozi replied:\nWhy not? Only to say what must be said.\nThose who say what must be said\ndo not speak with words.\nThe fisherman wades into the water,\nthe hunter chases the beast—\nnot for their own delight.\nThus the ultimate speech transcends speech,\nthe ultimate action transcends action.\nShallow thinkers contend for trifles.\n\nSpeech has its root,\naffairs have their master.\nOnly the ignorant\nremain unrecognized by me.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken—\nyet when spoken, it manifests things.\nWords are not the Dao.\nYet without words, it remains unclear.\n\nWhen Wenzi asked if one could speak of the Dao in subtle ways,\nand Laozi answered that only knowing what must be said is possible,\nthis is speech without speaking,\nand speaking without speech.\nThe fisherman and hunter—\nthese are those who do not know what must be said,\nclinging to words and fixated on things,\nthus their contests are for trifles.\nHow can one find those who transcend speech and action\nto converse with them?\n\nWenzi asked:\nDoes governing a state also have its principles?\nLaozi replied:\nNow, those who pull a cart,\ncall out *\"Left!\"* in front,\nand the rear responds in kind—\nthis is the song of urging the oxen forward.\nThough the melodies of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu differ,\nnone match this cart-puller’s true intent.\nGoverning a state relies on ritual propriety,\nnot on eloquent debate.\nThe more laws multiply, the more thieves and robbers arise.\nThose who rule a state are like Heaven and Earth:\nHeaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed;\nEarth does not utter, yet all things flourish.\n\nWhen Wenzi asked of the principles of governance,\nLaozi answered with the cart-puller’s song—\nfront calls, rear echoes—\njust as the Sage aligns with the natural order before Heaven,\nand follows the seasons after Heaven.\nGoverning relies on ritual propriety,\nnot on the superficial brilliance of words.\nTo ignore the fundamental order\nwhile multiplying laws\nis to provide thieves with legal pretexts\nand harm the people.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao has no fixed form yet can be the fixed form.\nLike mountains and forests yielding timber,\nyet timber does not equal mountains and forests;\nmountains and forests do not equal clouds and rains,\nclouds and rains do not equal yin and yang,\nyin and yang do not equal harmony,\nharmony does not equal the Dao.\nThe Dao is the state of form without form,\nthe image without image—\nthat which cannot be fully expressed,\nyet between Heaven and Earth\ncan be shaped and transformed.\nThe Dao has no fixed form—\nthings conform and take shape accordingly.\nTo observe mountains and forests transforming\ninto the harmony of clouds, rains, yin, and yang—\nthen one knows that all formless, imageless things\nbetween Heaven and Earth\ncan be shaped and transformed.\nThis is the Dao’s divine mystery.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Sage establishes teachings and administers governance,\never mindful of their beginning and end,\nand how they shape destiny.\nThus when the people know writing, virtue declines;\nwhen they know calculation, benevolence declines;\nwhen they know contracts, trust declines;\nwhen they know mechanical arts, sincerity declines.\nThe zither does not sound,\nyet its twenty-five strings each resonate with their own note.\nThe axle does not turn of itself,\nyet its thirty spokes each exert their strength to revolve.\nStrings must have slack and tight\nto produce melody,\nwheels must have labor and rest\nto travel far.\nTo make the resonant silent,\nto make the turning still—\nthis is the way.\nWhen governing principles diverge above and below,\neasy governance becomes chaos.\nHigh station with great Dao brings fortune,\ngreat affairs with small Dao bring misfortune.\nSmall virtue harms righteousness,\nsmall goodness harms the Dao,\npetty debate harms governance,\nharsh scrutiny harms virtue.\nThe greatest rectitude is not precarious,\nthus the people are easily guided.\nThe most refined governance is effortless,\nthus the subjects do not rebel.\nThe utmost loyalty returns to simplicity,\nthus the people harbor no deceit.\n\nThe Sage establishes teachings and administers governance,\nnot to seize for oneself—\nbut to observe their beginning and end,\nand act where no action is needed.\nTo know writing, calculation, contracts, and mechanical arts\nis to have one’s mind fixed on affairs,\nthus virtue, benevolence, trust, and sincerity decline.\n\nThe ruler relies on ministers to govern,\njust as the zither needs strings to sound,\nand wheels need spokes to travel far.\nTo grasp the essential and employ the great—\nthen there will be no ungoverned world.\n\nLaozi said:\nWhen the principle of *\"relative seating\"* is established,\nthe common people grumble.\nWhen the decree of *\"reducing titles\"* is proclaimed,\nmeritorious ministers rebel.\nThus those who focus on legal records\ndo not grasp the roots of order and chaos;\nthose who train in military formations\ndo not understand the strategic balance of temple and battlefield.\n\nThe Sage perceives blessings within the fortified pass,\nand dangers beyond the unseen depths.\n\nThe foolish are bewildered by petty gains,\nyet forget great harms.\nThus, affairs that bring profit in small matters\nbut harm in great ones,\nare obtained here\nwhile forgotten there.\n\nHence, there is no greater benevolence than loving others,\nno greater wisdom than knowing others.\nLoving others means no resentment or punishment,\nknowing others means no chaotic governance.\n\nGovernance cannot be achieved through excessive affairs,\nnor can law be effective with frequent changes.\nExcessive affairs and frequent changes\nwill cause the common people to grumble,\nmeritorious ministers to rebel,\nand the ruler will have means to summon them.\n\nThe roots of order and chaos,\nthe strategic balance of temple and battlefield—\nthe Sage discerns these in the unseen beyond form,\nthus possessing foresight’s clarity.\n\nLaozi said:\nThough the rivers are vast,\ntheir overflow is never beyond three days;\nnor does a violent wind and rain\nlast longer than a moment in the sun.\nYet those who lack accumulated virtue\nneed not fear ruin,\nfor it will not reach them.\n\nWorry is the source of prosperity,\njoy is the source of ruin.\nThus, the virtuous turn weakness into strength,\ntransforming misfortune into blessing,\nemploying the Dao though it seems void,\nyet never full of themselves.\n\nWhen a state’s harsh governance erupts,\nit is like the rivers overflowing,\nor winds and rains raging violently—\nthey do not last long,\nand ruin will soon follow.\nOnly those who lack virtue in their worry\nyet know how to adapt changes\ncan still turn misfortune into blessing,\nstrength from weakness,\nand understand the Dao’s unfathomable use.\n\nLaozi said:\nSerenity and tranquility\nare the nature of humankind.\nCeremonial propriety and measured conduct\nare the rules of affairs.\nKnowing the nature of others\nmeans one’s cultivation remains unerring,\nknowing the rules of affairs\nmeans one’s actions and movements are orderly.\n\nA single decree issues,\nyet no one contends with it—\nthis is called *the heart*.\nPerceiving the root to know its branches,\ngrasping one principle to respond to all—\nthis is called *skill*.\nTo dwell in knowledge’s source,\nact in accordance with its path,\nunderstand how to ride upon affairs,\nand know when to halt—\nthis is called *the Dao*.\n\nIf people praise and exalt me,\nit is the power of my heart;\nif they belittle and slander me,\nit is the fault of my heart.\n\nWords emerge from the mouth,\nyet cannot be restrained by others;\nactions originate from proximity,\nyet cannot be restrained by distance.\n\nAffairs are hard to complete yet easy to ruin,\nreputation is hard to establish yet easy to discard.\nAll people tend to slight small harms,\nneglect minor matters,\nuntil great calamities arrive.\n\nFor calamity comes from within,\nblessing is self-made.\nMisfortune and fortune share the same threshold,\nprofit and harm are neighboring forces.\nWithout utmost precision,\nnone can distinguish them.\nThus, wisdom and foresight\nare the gatekeepers of fortune and misfortune,\nthe pivotal mechanisms of action and stillness—\nthey must not be neglected lightly.\n\nHeaven’s principle and human desires\nalign in one heart,\nwhile noble and petty folk\ndiverge in one self—\nare they not the same origin yet different names?\n\nTo grasp one principle and respond to all is called *skill*,\nto see movement and know stillness is called *the Dao*.\nWords issue from the mouth,\nactions spring from the heart—\nfortune and misfortune, profit and harm,\ncome like reflections in water.\nWithout utmost precision,\nwho can separate them?\nCan one not examine oneself\nand reflect within the heart?\n\nLaozi said:\nAll know the triggers of order and chaos,\nyet none grasp the means of preserving life.\nThus, the Sage assesses the world to act accordingly,\nand contemplates affairs to devise strategy.\n\nThe Sage can be yielding or firm,\nsoft or hard,\nweak or strong—\nadapting to the times in movement and stillness,\nestablishing merit through resources,\nforeseeing the reverse of things,\nobserving one matter to discern its changes—\nforming patterns as they transform,\nresponding as they unfold—\nthus their entire lives are unconstrained.\n\nAffairs may be those that can be spoken of yet not done,\nor those that can be done yet not spoken of,\nor those that are easy to initiate yet hard to complete,\nor those that are hard to complete yet easy to ruin.\n\nThose that can be done yet not spoken of—\nare selection and rejection;\nthose that can be spoken of yet not done—\nare deceit and trickery.\nThose easy to initiate yet hard to complete—\nare affairs themselves,\nthose hard to complete yet easy to ruin—\nare reputations.\n\nThese four matters\nare the Sage’s careful considerations,\nthe insights of the enlightened.\n\nThere are times of order and chaos,\nwhile governance rests with humankind.\nKnowing the triggers of order and chaos,\nyet failing to grasp the means of preserving life—\nthe fault lies with humankind, not the times.\n\nThe Sage adapts to the times in movement and stillness,\nobserving their changes,\nthus their entire lives are unconstrained.\n\nWhen the times are right yet governance is rigid,\nhow can one avoid blame\nwhile failing to grasp the means of preserving life?\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao respects the subtle and small,\nacts without losing the moment—\na hundred precautions against calamity,\nyet misfortune does not grow.\n\nCalculating blessings yet not foreseeing them,\nworrying about misfortune yet overestimating it—\nlike plants struck by frost in the same day,\nthe sheltered ones are unharmed.\nThe foolish may prepare,\nyet their efforts match those of the wise.\n\nAccumulated love brings blessing,\naccumulated resentment brings misfortune.\nAll know how to avert calamity,\nyet none know how to prevent it from arising.\n\nPreventing calamity’s birth is easy,\nyet saving from calamity is difficult.\nNow people do not strive to prevent calamity’s birth,\nbut instead focus on saving from its aftermath—\neven the divine cannot devise such strategies.\n\nThe origins of calamity and misfortune\nare countless and boundless.\nThe Sage retreats deeply to avoid harm,\nremains silent to await the right moment;\nthe petty do not know the gates of fortune and misfortune,\nyet act and fall into punishment—\nthough they twist their preparations,\nthey cannot fully preserve themselves.\n\nThus, the superior cultivator\navoids misfortune first, then seeks profit,\nshuns disgrace first, then pursues reputation.\n\nHence, the Sage always attends to the unseen beyond form,\nwhile neglecting the already completed within sight—\nthus calamity has no path to arrive,\nnor can praise soil them with dust.\n\nThe Dao respects the subtle and small,\nacts without losing the moment—\nthis is the essence of caution at the outset.\nThe foolish may prepare,\nyet their efforts match those of the wise—\nfor people’s calamities\ncannot be repelled before they occur,\nnor can salvation be sought after they have arrived.\n\nThus, the superior cultivator\nprioritizes avoiding misfortune and disgrace,\nwhile placing reputation and profit aside,\nnever demanding them.\n\nThe Master Laozi says:\n\nThe common person’s Dao:\ndesires a small **heart**,\nyet a great **will**,\nwishes for all-encompassing **wisdom**,\nyet upright **conduct**,\nseeks many **abilities**,\nyet few **undertakings**.\n\nThe so-called small **heart**—\nbefore misfortune arises,\nthey guard against calamity and tread with caution,\nnot daring to indulge their desires.\n\nThe great **will**—\nembracing all under heaven,\nunifying diverse customs,\nwhere right and wrong converge,\nand they stand at the center.\n\nThe all-encompassing **wisdom**—\nendless yet boundless,\nflowing in four directions,\ndeep yet unfathomable.\n\nThe upright **conduct**—\nstanding straight yet unyielding,\npure white yet unstained,\nin adversity never altering their principles,\nin prosperity never boasting.\n\nThe many **abilities**—\npossessing both literary and martial arts,\nbalanced in action and stillness,\ntheir movements and gestures fittingly adapted,\nbending yet never breaking.\n\nThe few **undertakings**—\ngrasping the essential to govern the multitude,\nholding the strict to manage the broad,\nremaining tranquil to steady the restless.\n\nThus, the small-**hearted** guard against the slightest danger,\nthe great-**willed** embrace all things,\nthe all-**wise** know all things,\nthe upright-**conducted** have nothing they refuse,\nthe many-**able** can govern all things,\nthe few-**tasked** hold fast to what they possess.\n\nHence, the Sage’s approach to **virtue**—\nthey do not slight the small and fail to act,\nnor overlook the slightest fault without correction.\nTheir actions require no **diviners** or **shamans**,\nyet ghosts and spirits dare not act first—\nthis may truly be called the most precious **virtue**.\n\nYet they tremble and quake,\never vigilant day by day,\nthus attaining the sincerity of **non-action** and unity.\n\nThe foolish person’s **wisdom** is already limited,\nand what they undertake is excessive—\nthus their actions always fail.\nIf they govern with **rightness**, their efforts are easy yet certain to succeed;\nif they govern with **deviance**, their efforts are difficult yet certain to fail.\nAbandoning what is easy yet certain to succeed,\nand persisting in what is difficult yet certain to fail—\nthis is the folly of the confused.\n\nThe **will** must be great while the **heart** must be small,\n**wisdom** all-encompassing yet **conduct** upright,\n**abilities** many yet **undertakings** few.\nThese six principles—\nthe common person must strive to embody them.\n\nA great **will** can contain all things,\na small **heart** guards against the slightest danger,\nall-encompassing **wisdom** makes all undertakings possible,\nupright **conduct** stands firm yet unyielding,\nmany **abilities** ensure nothing remains unaccomplished,\nfew **undertakings** bring strictness and steadfastness.\n\nThe Sage’s actions do not require **diviners** or **shamans**,\nyet ghosts and spirits dare not act first—\nit is merely through sincerity that they attain unity.\n\nThe Master Laozi says:\n**Ren** is what people admire,\n**Yi** is what people revere.\nTo be admired and revered,\nyet meet with personal death and national ruin—\nthis is because they did not adapt to the times.\n\nThus, those who know **ren** and **yi** yet fail to grasp worldly **power**,\nhave not attained the Dao.\n\nThe Five Emperors valued **virtue/power**,\nthe Three Kings relied on **Yi**,\nthe Five Hegemons depended on **force**.\nNow, applying the Dao of the Emperors and Kings to the age of the Five Hegemons—\nthis is not their proper Dao.\n\nThus, **goodness** and **evil** are alike,\npraise and blame depend on custom,\nactions are equal,\nyet **harmony** and **disorder** lie in the times.\nKnowing the **Heavenly** Way’s workings,\nand understanding human actions—\nthen one can govern the world.\n\nTo know **Heaven** yet not know people,\nis to lack the means to interact with customs.\nTo know people yet not know **Heaven**,\nis to lack the means to align with the Dao.\n\nIf one’s **will** is straight yet their emotions are suited,\nthey will be assailed by **firmness**,\nand forced to serve others.\nIf one’s **will** is suited yet their emotions are straight,\nthey will be consumed by **yin-yang** forces.\nThe Dao is not practiced—\nI know why.\n\nThe Five Emperors valued **virtue/power**,\nthe Three Kings relied on **Yi**,\nthe Five Hegemons depended on **force**.\n\nIn the age of the Five Hegemons,\nyet applying the Dao of the Emperors and Kings—\nthis is because they did not adapt to the times.\n\nTo fail in adapting to the times,\nis to fail in knowing **Heaven** and people.\nHow then can they govern the world?\n\nThose who attain the Dao—\nexternally transform yet internally remain unchanged,\nexternally transform to know people,\ninternally remain unchanged to preserve themselves.\nThus, within they maintain a steadfast unity,\nwhile externally they bend and adapt,\nmoving with the times,\nyet never falling into error.\nWhat is precious in the Dao,\nis its **dragon-like** transformation.\n\nTo uphold one principle,\nand act in one way—\neven if they achieve fullness,\nthey never alter.\nClinging to minor virtues,\nyet obstructing the great Dao.\n\nThe Dao is **stillness** and **emptiness**,\nnot forcing things externally,\nnor imposing on oneself internally.\nThus, undertaking actions in accordance with the Dao—\nis not the work of those who do not know the Dao,\nbut the application of the Dao itself.\n\nThe **dragon** and **tiger’s** transformations—\nthis is the Dao of the great person.\n\nThose who attain the Dao\nadapt to all things yet never fall into error—\nthus Laozi was called the **\"Dragon\"** of the Dao.\n\nTo embody the Dao’s **emptiness**,\nexternally not imposing on things,\ninternally not imposing on oneself—\nthe Dao is applied to all,\nand the world is transformed.\n\nThe heavens and earth cover and bear all things,\nthe sun and moon illuminate and shine upon them,\nthe yin and yang nurture them,\nthe rain and dew moisturize them,\nthe **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** sustain them—\nall share in the same **harmony/and**.\n\nThus, those who wear the Great Round\nwalk the Great Square,\nthose who gaze upon the Great Clarity\nsee the Great Brightness,\nthose who stand upon the Great Balance\ndwell in the Great Hall,\nand those who wander in the **mysterious/void** (*míngmíng*)\nshare the same light as the sun and moon—\nshapeless yet giving rise to the shaped,\nso the **true person** (*zhēnrén*) entrusts his time to the **spiritual platform** (*língtái*)\nand returns to the **origin of things** (*wù zhī chū*).\n\nTo see in the **mysterious/void** (*míngmíng*),\nto hear in the **silent** (*wúshēng*)—\nwithin the **mysterious/void**,\nonly he has **awareness** (*xiǎo*);\nwithin **stillness and emptiness** (*jìmò*),\nonly he has **illumination** (*zhào*).\n\nHis **application** (*yòng*) is to **not apply** (*wúyòng*),\nonly then can he truly **apply** (*yòng*).\nHis **knowledge** (*zhī*) is to **not know** (*wúzhī*),\nonly then can he truly **know** (*zhī*).\n\n**Harmony/And** is the **universal Dao/Way** of the world.\nThe heavens’ covering, the earth’s bearing—\nall align with the same **harmony/and**.\n\nThe **sage-king** (*huángdì*) wears the Round and walks the Square,\ndwells in the Great Hall and stands upon the Great Balance—\ncan his **harmony/and** be lost?\n\nThe **true person** (*zhēnrén*) returns to the **origin of things** (*wù zhī chū*),\nsurely he must have **unique insight** (*dújiàn*) within the **mysterious/void** (*míngmíng*).\n\nThus, **application** is to **not apply**,\nonly then can he **apply**.\n**Knowledge** is to **not know**,\nonly then can he **know**.\nThis is called **Great Harmony**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is what things **follow** (*dào*),\n**Virtue/power** is what life **sustains** (*fú*),\n**Ren** is the **manifestation of accumulated kindness** (*jī'èn*),\nand **Yi** is the **principle of alignment with the heart and fitting for the multitude** (*bǐyú xīn ér héyú zhòngshì*).\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** fades, **virtue/power** flourishes;\nwhen **virtue/power** wanes, **Ren** and **Yi** arise.\nThus, in the **Upper Age** (*shàngshì*), the **Dao/Way** is upheld but **virtue/power** is not yet emphasized,\nin the **Middle Age**, **virtue/power** is guarded but **Ren** and **Yi** are not yet embraced,\nand in the **Lower Age**, there is **fear of losing Ren and Yi** (*jīngjīng ér kǒng shī rén yì*), so **Ren** and **Yi** are clung to.\nTherefore, the **noble person** (*jūnzǐ*) cannot live without **Yi**—\nto lose **Yi** is to lose the very means of his existence;\nthe **petty person** (*xiǎorén*) cannot survive without **profit** (*lì*)—\nto lose **profit** is to lose the very means of his survival.\nThus, the **noble person** fears losing **Yi**,\nthe **petty person** fears losing **profit**—\nobserving their fears,\nthe paths to **disaster** and **blessing** diverge.\n\nWhen **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, **Ren** and **Yi** fracture,\nthe **sage-kings** and **kings** (*huángdì wángbó*) are divided—\nthis is the work of the **changing times** (*shìbiàn*).\n\nThe **Dao/Way** guides them,\n**virtue/power** nourishes them,\n**Ren** bestows kindness upon them,\nand **Yi** makes them **proper/right** (*yí*).\nThough the four ages differ in governance,\ntheir **noble rulers** and **ministers** maintain their **proper distinctions** (*yǒu fēn zé yī*).\n\nThose who uphold the **Dao/Way** but not **virtue/power** are **sage-kings** (*huáng*),\nthose who guard **virtue/power** but do not embrace **Ren** are **kings** (*dì*),\nand those who fear losing **Ren** and **Yi** are **lords** (*wáng*).\nWhen **Yi** loses its **proper alignment** (*qǐ yí shī qí yí*),\n**crafty deceit** (*zhìzhà*) thrives.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Some seek profit and thereby harm themselves,\nsome seek harm and thereby profit themselves.*\nTo **force** (*qiáng*) the **ill** (*bìng*) with **heat** (*wēn*) when they crave **warmth** (*rè*),\nto **force** the **thirsty** (*kě*) with **cold** (*hán*) when they crave **coolness** (*lěng*)—\nthis is how the **common folk** (*zhòngrén*) **nurture** (*yǎng*) themselves,\nyet the **skilled physician** (*liángyī*) knows this as **the cause of illness** (*wéi bìng*).\n\n**Delight** (*kuài*) in the **eyes**,\n**pleasure** (*yuè*) in the **heart**—\nthese are the **fool’s** (*yú*) **advantages** (*lì*),\nyet the **person of the Dao/Way** (*yǒudào zhě*) **avoids** (*bì*) them.\n\nThe **sage** (*shèngrén*) first **encounters** (*féng*) and then **unites** (*hé*) with the multitude,\nwhile the **common folk** first **unite** and then **encounter**—\nthus, the **gates of disaster and blessing** (*huòfú zhī mén*)\nand the **contraries of profit and harm** (*lìhài zhī fǎn*)\ncannot be overlooked.\n\nThere are matters where seeking **profit** brings **harm**,\nand seeking **harm** brings **profit**—\nnot even **human effort** (*rénlì*) can **guarantee** (*bì*) them,\nfor **things** may **cause** (*shǐ*) them.\n\nThus, those who **first oppose** (*xiān yǔ*) and then **unite** (*hé*)\nfollow the **sage’s Dao/Way** (*shèngrén zhī dào*),\nwhile those who **first unite** and then **oppose** (*yǔ*)\nfollow the **common folk’s Dao/Way** (*zhòngrén zhī dào*).\n**Disaster** and **blessing**, **profit** and **harm**,\nlie in wait—\ntheir **unpredictability** (*bùkě bù chá*) is thus.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Those with **meritorious deeds** (*yǒng*) yet **divergent from Ren and Yi** will be **suspected** (*yí*),\nthose with **guilt** (*zuì*) yet **aligned with Ren and Yi** will be **trusted** (*xìn*).*\nThus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the **constant proper alignment** (*chángshùn*) of affairs,\nthe **most honored rank** (*zūnjué*) in the world.\n\nThough **plans** (*móu*) and **calculations** (*jì*) may **seem correct** (*dāng*),\nand **worries** (*yōu*) and **concerns** (*huàn*) may **be solved** (*jiě tú*),\nif the **state** (*guó*) is preserved,\nyet one’s **affairs** (*shì*) **diverge from Ren and Yi**,\nhis **merits** (*gōng*) will **not be fulfilled** (*bù suì*).\n\nThough **words** (*yán*) may **not align** (*wúzhòng*) with **strategy** (*cè*),\nand **calculations** may **not benefit** (*wúyì*) the **state**,\nif one’s **heart** (*xīn*) is **loyal** (*zhōu*) to the **lord** (*jūn*),\nand **affairs** are **aligned with Ren and Yi** (*héyú rén yì*),\none’s **life** (*shēn*) will **surely be preserved** (*bì cún*).\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"A hundred words, a hundred calculations, often **not fitting** (*bùdāng*),\nare **not as good as** (*bùruò*) **abandoning haste** (*shě qū*) and **carefully examining Ren and Yi** (*shěn zhū rén yì*).*\n\n**Ren** and **Yi** are the **grandchildren** (*sūn*) of the **Dao/Way**,\nthe **children** (*zǐ*) of **virtue/power**—\nyet the four **never fail to interrelate** (*fù ruò bù xiāngjí*),\nand **never truly separate** (*xiānglí*).\n\nThus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the **most honored rank** in the world—\nfor those who **value their own bodies** as the **world** (*wéi tiānxià zhě*),\ncan they **not abandon haste** and **examine carefully** these **Ren** and **Yi**?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The **noble person’s** (*jūnzǐ*) **teaching** (*jiào*) originates from **himself**,\nthe **petty person** receives its **benefits** (*zé*).\n**Profit** (*lì*) originates from the **petty person**,\nthe **noble person** enjoys its **merits** (*gōng*).\n\nTo let the **noble person** and the **petty person** each find their **proper place** (*qí yí*),\nis to **harmonize merits** and **transform nourishment** (*tōng gōng yì shí*)\nand thus **achieve the Dao’s fulfillment** (*dào dá*).\n\nMany **desire** (*yù*) and thereby **injure** (*shāng*) **Yi**,\nmany **worry** (*yōu*) and thereby **harm** (*hài*) **wisdom** (*zhì*),\nso **governing** the **state** with **what brings joy** (*lè*) ensures its **preservation** (*cún*),\nwhile **tyrannizing** the **state** with **what brings joy** ensures its **ruin** (*wáng*).\n\nWater flows downward yet is **vast** (*guǎngdà*),\nthe **lord** is **benevolent** (*cí*) yet **wise** (*míng*).\nIf the **lord** does not **contend** (*zhēng*) with his **ministers** (*chén*),\nthe **governing Dao/Way** will **be fulfilled** (*tōng*).\nThus, the **lord** is the **root and foundation** (*gēnběn*),\nthe **ministers** are the **branches and leaves** (*zhīyè*).\nIf the **root and foundation** are **not beautiful** (*bù měi*),\nyet the **branches and leaves** flourish—\nthis has never occurred.\n\nThe **noble person** and the **petty person**—\nboth are **people** (*rén*).\nIf the **noble person’s** **teaching** (*jiào*) is **not received** (*bèi*) by the **petty person**,\nhow can his **virtue/power** (*dé*) **provide sustenance** (*zī*) for the **petty person’s** **nourishment** (*yǎng*)?\n\n**Governing** the **state** with **what brings joy** ensures its **preservation**,\n**tyrannizing** the **state** with **what brings joy** ensures its **ruin**.\nIf the **lord** is **good at yielding** (*shàn xià*) yet **does not contend** (*bù zhēng*),\nthen his **ministers** will **offer their loyalty** (*xiàn qí zhōng*).\n\n**Stability** (*zhì*) secures the **root** (*gēn*), **depth** (*shēn*) strengthens the **foundation** (*běn*),\nand thus the **state** is **safe** (*ān*).\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The **loving father’s** (*cífù*) **care** (*ài*) for his

**harm** share a **threshold** (*tóngmén*),\n**calamity** and **blessing** are **neighbors** (*tónglín*).\nNone but the **sage** (*shèngshèng*) can **discriminate** (*fèn*).\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Calamity* (*huò*) **leans** on **blessing** (*fú*),\n**blessing** **hides** within **calamity** (*fú xià huò fú*).\nWho can **fathom** its **limit** (*qí jí*)?\n\n**Calamity** and

virtuous and capable,\nto abolish rites and moral teachings,\nto extinguish customs and debates,\nto ban deceit and falsehood—\nthen the **Exemplary** and the **Petty** alike align with the **Dao**.\n\n*Jìng, then all is unified;\nXū, then all is harmonized.*\n**Supreme virtue** is **non-action**—\nall things find their place within it.\n\nThe **Dao of emptiness and stillness**—\nheaven’s duration, earth’s endurance,\n**qi** subtly pervades, boundless.\nOver all things, it holds no sway.\n\n**Zìrán** is **heaven’s principle**;\n**bù zìrán** is **human desire**.\n\nWhen **clear and empty**, it shines—\nthis is **heaven’s natural state**.\nWhen **non-action** governs, it is **ordered**—\nthis is **human nature’s way**.\n\n**Zìrán**—then the **Exemplary** and the **Petty** align with the **Dao**.\n\nThus the **Sage**, divine and luminous,\nilluminates the world—\nyet no thing is ruled by him.\n\nThe **twelve months** cycle endlessly,\n**wood, metal, water, fire, earth**—\ntheir forces clash, yet their **Dao** depends on one another.\nThus **extreme cold** harms, yet **no cold** is without harm;\n**extreme heat** harms, yet **no heat** is without harm—\nso **what is permissible** and **what is not** both find their place.\nThus the **Great Dao** knows no **‘cannot’**—\nwhat is permissible lies in its **principle**;\nwhen one sees **what is permissible**, one does not rush toward it;\nwhen one sees **what is not permissible**, one does not reject it.\n**Permissible** and **impermissible** are like left and right,\nlike exterior and interior.\n\nAll things begin with **oneness**,\n**time** marks their measure—\nfrom antiquity to today, unchanging—\nthis is called **heaven’s principle**.\n\nAbove, it holds **Great Clarity**;\nbelow, it manifests as **light**.\nThe **Dao** gives birth to all things,\nits **principle** lies in **yin and yang**,\nits transformation becomes the **four seasons**,\nits division forms the **five phases**—\neach attains its proper place.\n\nIn harmony with **time**, it flows with **law**,\nits measures are constant.\nThough the lowly lack ability,\nthe **Dao** above does not falter.\nMinisters act in unity—\n**heaven and earth’s Dao**:\n**non-action** yet complete,\n**no seeking** yet all is gained—\nthus one knows that **non-action** brings benefit.\n\nBetween **heaven and earth**, what flows and transforms without ceasing?\nIt is **qi** alone.\nThere is **spirit** within it—\nyet none can recognize it.\n\n**Oneness** marks its beginning,\n**time** its measure—\nfrom ancient to present, it never errs—\nthis is called **heaven’s principle**.\n\nThe **Dao** gives birth to all things,\nits measures are constant.\nSomething

zì shēng, sǐ zhě zì sǐ,\ndé yuàn hé yǒu zāi?\"*\n\nThe **Laozi** says: The **Sage** is like the heavens covering and the earth bearing, the sun and moon shining upon all, the **Yin** and **Yang** harmonized, the four seasons transforming—embracing all things yet not conforming, neither rigidly old nor newly fanciful, neither distant nor close in favor.\n\nThus, the **Sage** can follow the **Heavenly Dao**, for **Heaven** does not act at one time, the earth does not hoard one kind of wealth, and humans do not pursue one kind of affair. Therefore, undertakings are manifold, and actions proceed in diverse directions. Thus, those who wield arms may act with lightness or weight, greed or restraint—these four opposites cannot be uniformly applied.\n\nThe light of heart may wish to strike, the heavy of heart may wish to halt, the greedy may wish to seize, the restrained may see no profit—yet this is not their true nature. Therefore, the bold can be ordered to advance and fight, but not to hold fast to the unyielding; the heavy can be ordered to stand firm, but not to assail the enemy; the greedy can be ordered to attack and take, but not to divide spoils; the restrained can be ordered to keep their share, but not to advance and seize; the trustworthy can be ordered to uphold strictures, but not to adapt to circumstances.\n\nThe **Sage** employs these five qualities in combination, assigning them according to their talents. **Heaven** and **Earth** do not favor one thing, nor do **Yin** and **Yang** produce one kind of being. Therefore, the sea does not refuse the trickling waters to become vast, the mountains and forests do not reject the crooked and bent to become lofty, and the **Sage** does not spurn the humble words of the common folk to broaden their influence.\n\nTo cling to one corner while neglecting the rest, to take one thing while discarding others—this is to make one’s gains few and one’s governance shallow. **Heaven’s** command is singular, yet the **qi** of sensation varies, nature follows substance in difference, and transformation yields myriad distinctions—these cannot be arbitrarily forced into uniformity.\n\nThe **Sage** aligns with **Heaven** and follows the **Dao**, not regarding diverse regions and customs as obstacles, but covering and bearing them, nourishing and fostering them, all in one principle. **Laozi** says: What **Heaven** covers and the earth bears, what the sun and moon illuminate—though their forms differ and their natures vary, each finds its own place of rest.\n\nWhat brings **joy** also brings **sorrow**, what brings **rest** also brings **peril**. Thus, the **Sage** tends the people by letting each follow their nature, rest in their dwelling, dwell where they suit, do what they are able, adapt to what they meet, and apply what they need. In this way, all things are in harmony, with no cause for mutual offense.\n\nAll things under **Heaven** have no intrinsic nobility or baseness; they are made noble by what is valued, and all things are noble. They are made base by what is despised, and all things are base. Therefore, the **Sage** who does not exalt the worthy does not cast fish into trees nor drown birds in deep pools.\n\nA good shepherd of the people does not apply one law to all; though forms differ and natures vary, each finds their own place of rest. If one reverses this and forces uniformity, the **Dao** of life is lost.\n\nNow then, what **Zhuangzi** called *Qíwùlùn* (\"On Equalizing Things\")—is it truly about equalizing things? It is about the **logic of equalizing things**. **Heaven’s** creation of beings assigns each according to their inherent talents and strengthens them accordingly.\n\nIn the time of **Yao**, his governance of the world saw **Shun** as Minister of Instruction, **Xie** as Minister of War, **Yu** as Minister of Works, **Houji** as Master of Fields, and **Xizhong** as Master of Crafts. In guiding the people, those dwelling near water were taught fishing, those in forests were taught hunting, those in valleys were taught herding, and those on land were taught farming.\n\nThe land suited their labors, their labors suited their tools, and their tools suited their talents. In the marshes, nets were woven; on the hillsides, fields were tilled. Thus, the people found ease in what they possessed, and what they lacked they exchanged for what they had skill in, while what they had skill in they exchanged for what they lacked. Therefore, few abandoned him, and many obeyed, like the wind passing through reeds, stirring them effortlessly.\n\nEach responded according to their clarity or turbidity, and all sought what benefited them and avoided what harmed them. Thus, neighboring states looked upon one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs were heard across borders, yet footsteps did not cross into the domains of the lords, nor were tracks left beyond a thousand miles—all rested in their own dwellings.\n\nTherefore, a chaotic state seems like a well-ordered one, a flourishing state seems like a decaying one, a state with abundance seems like one lacking, and a state with survival seems like one with excess.\n\nThe decaying is not without people, but each guards their own role; the flourishing is not from many people, but all are bent toward trivial pursuits; the abundant is not from excess wealth, but from moderation and few demands; the lacking is not from scarcity, but from sparse people and heavy expenditures.\n\nThus, the laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation, but what they followed; their punishments and executions were not their own doing, but what they upheld—the **highest virtue’s Dao**.\n\nThe ancient rulers of the world were at ease while their ministers labored, governing without action. In **Yao’s** time, **Shun** was Minister of Instruction, **Xie** was Minister of War, **Yu** was Minister of Works, and all officials held their posts, each according to their ability. When the right person was placed in office, the people rested in their dwellings, and the work was accomplished, the affairs settled—all the people said, *\"This is as if by nature.\"*\n\n**Laozi** says: To govern the world with the **Dao** is not to alter human nature, but to clarify and smooth what already exists. Therefore, to follow is great, to impose is small.\n\nThe ancient who dredged water followed its flow, those who grew crops followed the land’s suitability, and those who waged war followed the people’s desires. To follow is to have no rival in the world.\n\nThings must first be in accordance with their nature before human affairs can be properly ordered. Therefore, the ancient kings’ institutions were based on human nature, establishing measures and regulations to guide it.\n\nWithout its nature, one cannot make it conform to instruction; with its nature but lacking the means, one cannot make it follow the **Dao**. Human nature has the potential for **virtue** and **righteousness**, yet without the **Sage’s** guidance, laws and regulations cannot make it turn toward the proper path.\n\nTo act against its nature, one must use what it dislikes to restrain deceit—thus, punishments are not applied, yet authority spreads like the divine. To act with its nature, the world listens and follows; to act against it, laws and regulations are proclaimed yet ignored.\n\nThe **Sage** establishes teaching in accordance with human nature and observes customs to govern. What the people love, the **Sage** loves; what the people hate, the **Sage** hates. Thus, the people’s hearts turn toward him, and he has no rival in the world.\n\n**Dao** and **virtue** are the roots of merit and renown, what the people cherish. When the people cherish them, merit and renown are established.\n\nThe ancient who excelled in rule followed the **Dao** of the great rivers: the great rivers act without action to become vast, sink low to become broad, and thus endure as the world’s channels and valleys. Their **virtue** is sufficient, without action they receive all streams, without seeking they obtain, without striving they arrive. Therefore, they take the world.\n\n#1 *\"易所拙\"* (easily exchange what they lack for what they are skilled in)\n\nThe **Dao** is such that the unadorned is most noble—thus wealth comes without striving,\nthe unseen is most clear—thus wisdom arises without display,\nthe unvaunted endures longest—thus greatness is achieved without self-aggrandizement,\ndwelling where none reside.\nThus, one becomes the sovereign of the world:\nwithout contention, none can contend with them;\nwhen they cease to strive for greatness, true greatness is attained.\nThe rivers and seas are close to the **Dao**, thus they endure long and align with Heaven and Earth.\nThe sovereign who cultivates the **Dao** completes their work without claiming it—\nnot claiming it makes them strong and firm,\nstrong and firm without tyranny over others,\ndeep in the **Dao** means deep in virtue,\ndeep virtue brings lasting renown—this is called **mysterious virtue**, profound and distant,\ncontrary to the ways of things.\n\n**Dao** and virtue are not tools for seeking fame,\nyet fame follows naturally.\nThe ancient who excelled in rule\npreserved the **virtue** of non-action,\ndwelled in the position of non-contention,\ncompleted their work without claiming it,\nthus they could endure alongside Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nyet none know its principle—\nonly the **Sage** knows how.\nNeither male nor female,\nneither yin nor yang,\nborn yet not dying.\n\nHeaven and Earth are completed,\nyin and yang take form,\nand all things are born.\nThus, yin and yang have round and square,\nshort and long,\nexistence and extinction—\nthe **Dao** names them.\n\nObscure and deep, yet without action,\nin the heart it is subtle,\nin the **Dao** it is correct,\nlife and death share the same principle,\nall things transform and merge into the **Dao**—\nsimplifying life, forgetting death,\nwhere can one not be long-lived?\nAbandoning deeds and words,\nfollowing non-action,\nguarding the **Dao** thoroughly,\nnot dominating things,\nsubtle and formless.\n\nAt the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nall things revolve within the **Dao** yet differ in form—\nutterly subtle, without substance,\nthus they can embrace all;\nutterly vast, without boundary,\nthus they become all things;\nutterly minute, without interior,\nthus they are most precious to all things.\nThe **Dao** sustains life,\nvirtue stabilizes form.\nThe measure of the **Dao** is to abandon preferences and aversions,\nwithout knowing yet without error,\neasing the mind and harmonizing the heart,\nwithout departing from the **Dao**.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite as one,\nyet divide into two,\nthen return and merge.\nAbove and below remain unlost,\nunited as one,\ndivided into five,\nthen returning to merge—\nnecessarily conforming to the square and compass.\n\nThe **Dao** is most intimate yet cannot be slighted,\nmost near yet cannot be distanced—\nseeking it far away only leads back.\nTo know the ancient origins is to grasp the **Dao**’s principles.\n\nIs the **Dao** the origin of the world?\nFormless yet vast,\nunspoken yet trusted,\ntransforming without measure,\nits principle unknown—\nonly the **Sage** knows it.\nThus, daily responding to myriad affairs,\nnever opposing the **Dao**,\nreturning and merging—\nthis is the **Dao**’s principle.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe **Emperor** has a name,\nyet none know their essence.\nThe **Emperor** values **virtue**,\nthe **King** upholds righteousness,\nthe **Conqueror** grasps principle.\n\nThe **Sage**’s **Dao** in things is nonexistent—\nonly when paths narrow do they employ intelligence,\nwhen virtue is shallow do they rely on punishment,\nwhen insight is shallow do they scrutinize.\nThose who rely on intelligence bring inner chaos,\nthose who rely on punishment invite grievance from above and below,\nthose who rely on scrutiny fail to seek goodness to serve their superiors and thus bring ruin.\nThus, the **Sage** follows Heaven and Earth in transforming their **virtue**—\nHeaven covers, Earth bears,\nguiding by season,\nnourishment thus becomes abundant,\nabundant nourishment brings order.\nEven with divine sagacity,\nwhat could replace this?\n\nAbandon artificial knowledge,\nreduce punishments,\nreturn to clarity and stillness—\nthings will naturally correct themselves.\n\nAt the dawn of civilization, who was the **Emperor**?\nIn the **Primeval Age**, the Three Sovereigns:\nthe people were like infants,\nbreathing in harmony with the **Great Unity**,\nwithout thought or action.\nIn the **High Antiquity**, the Three Sovereigns:\nthe people were like young children,\ncontent with sucking and patting their bellies,\ndoing nothing deliberately.\nIn the **Later Antiquity**, the Three Sovereigns:\nthe people were like children,\nsimple and scattered, the **Dao** still in practice,\ncooking meat and grains,\nthe world cherished them.\nThe Five **Emperors** valued **virtue**,\nthe world praised them.\nThe Three **Kings** upheld righteousness,\nthe world feared them.\nThe Five **Hegemons** lost principle,\nthe world scorned them.\n\nWhen the **Mysterious Sage** does not act,\nthe **Plain King** follows,\nestablishing words and teachings,\nbecoming the teacher for ten thousand generations.\nWhen a **Sage** arises again,\nnothing can replace them.\n\nThe **Dao** as sovereign\nis like a corpse standing solemn and silent,\nyet the world receives its blessings—\none person covered by it is not excessive,\nten thousand covered by it is not confined.\nThus, excessive kindness is as harmful as excessive cruelty—\nboth encounter the **Dao**.\n\nKindness is giving without merit,\nbestowing high rank without labor—\nthen those in office grow slack,\nand idlers rush forward eagerly.\nCruelty is killing without guilt,\npunishing those who follow the **Dao**—\nthen those who cultivate themselves cease to encourage virtue\nwhile evildoers grow bold in defiance.\n\nThus, excessive kindness breeds deceit,\nexcessive cruelty breeds chaos—\ndeceit and chaos are the winds of a collapsing state.\nHence, when there are executions, the ruler is not angry,\nwhen there are rewards, the ruler does not share in them—\nthose punished bear no grudge, for the ruler’s blame is just,\nthose rewarded feel no debt, for the ruler’s merit is complete.\nThe people know that punishments and rewards arise from themselves,\nthus they strive for merit and cultivate their work without relying on others.\nTherefore, the court is orderly without trace,\nthe fields are tilled without filth.\n\nThus, the **Supreme Sovereign** knows what is natural—\nspring gives birth, autumn kills—\nthis is the **Dao** of Heaven.\nThe ruler follows Heaven’s **Dao**,\nand subjects know what to fear and emulate.\nPunishments and rewards arise from themselves—\nno one harbors hopes of fortune.\nThe court is upright, the fields are clear—\nthe **Supreme Sovereign**’s ways can be restored.\n\nThe **Kingly Way** dwells in non-action,\npractices speechless teaching,\nremains still and unmoving,\nfixed yet unshaken,\nfollows naturally without coercion,\nachieves results without toil,\nplans without error,\nacts without fault,\nspeaks without rhetoric,\nmoves without ceremony,\nadvances and retreats in season,\nactive and still in accordance with principle.\nNeither praising beauty nor hating ugliness,\nneither favoring reward nor dreading punishment,\nnames are self-bestowed,\ncategories self-classified,\naffairs arise naturally—\nnone originate from them.\n\nIf one seeks to constrain it, one only drives it apart;\nif one seeks to adorn it, one only robs it of its essence.\n\nHeaven’s **qi** is the **hun** (spirit-soul),\nEarth’s **qi** is the **po** (corporeal soul).\nTheir interplay is profound and mysterious—\neach abides in its proper domain.\nGuard them and do not lose them,\nand one ascends to **Taiyi** (the Supreme Unity).\nThe essence of **Taiyi** merges with Heaven.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven is silent and boundless,\nwithout form or measure,\ntoo vast to fathom, too deep to sound,\nyet ever transforming with humanity—\nwisdom cannot grasp it,\nits motion turns without end,\nits transformations unfold like divinity.\nIt follows naturally, ever yielding yet never leading.\n\nIn governance, one must hold a **empty heart** and **weakened resolve**,\nclear and bright without obscurity—\nthus ministers converge like spokes to a hub.\nWhether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,\nall contribute their fullest measure.\nThe sovereign gains the means to govern his ministers,\nthe ministers gain the means to serve their sovereign—\nthus the clarity of ruling a state is achieved.\n\nHe who holds **all-under-Heaven** need not fear disorder,\nbut fear failing to secure the right people.\nTo secure the right people is to let the **Kingly Way** flourish above—\nguard it and do not lose it,\nand one ascends to **Taiyi**.\n\nIts motion turns without end,\nits transformations unfold like divinity.\nMinisters converge, each contributing their fullest measure.\nThus it is known that the order or chaos of a state depends on its people.\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*\"He who knows and loves to ask is sage,\nhe who is courageous and loves to ask is victorious.\nHe who rides the wisdom of the masses can accomplish anything,\nhe who harnesses the strength of the masses can overcome anything.\nHe who relies on the masses’ strength need not fear failure,\nhe who harnesses the masses’ momentum can achieve all-under-Heaven.\nWithout the **power** of proper **effort**, no **method** can succeed—\neven the sage cannot force success.\nThus the sage, in undertaking any matter, never fails to utilize what is already present.\nOne who has a talent occupies a position,\none who has an ability undertakes a task.\nIf strength matches the task, the appointed will not labor in vain,\nif ability matches the task, the executor will not find it difficult.\nThe sage combines and employs them all—\nthus no person is discarded, no talent is wasted.\nWisdom, benevolence, and courage—\nthese are the universal virtues,\nand love of inquiry enriches them.\nTo unite the wisdom of the masses,\nto harness their strength—\nthen all-under-Heaven is unconquerable.\nOne who has a talent occupies a position,\none who has an ability undertakes a task—\nthe sage combines and employs them all,\nthus no person is discarded, no talent is wasted.\"*\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*\"What is called **non-action** is not that it does not draw near when summoned,\nnor repel when pushed,\nnor fail to respond when pressed,\nnor remain unmoved when stirred,\nnor become stagnant when still,\nnor disperse when gathered.\nIt means private desires do not intrude upon public **Dao**,\npassions do not cling to proper **method**,\nactions follow **principle**,\nachievements arise from what is already present,\npushing along the natural momentum—\nartifice finds no place.\nWhen the deed is done, the self takes no credit;\nwhen the work is complete, the name is not claimed.\nAs water carries the boat,\nas sand bears the **jue** (a type of cart),\nas mud supports the **tuo** (a type of sled),\nas mountains hold the **zhu** (a type of rope),\nsummer floods and winter pools—\nall arise from high and low.\nThis is not what I do.\nThe sage does not shame his humble station,\nbut laments the **Dao**’s failure to prevail.\nHe does not grieve his short lifespan,\nbut grieves the people’s hardship.\nThus he remains ever **empty** and **non-acting**,\nembracing simplicity and returning to naturalness,\nnot mingling with the myriad things.\n**Non-action** is not having a heart like wood or stone—\nunmoving.\nThe sage responds to things without preceding them,\nfollowing their natural momentum,\nto shape all things—\nwhat need is there for action?\"*\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*\"The ancient founders of imperial rule did not establish it to indulge their desires,\nnor did the sage who ascended the throne do so for personal ease.\nThey saw how the strong oppressed the weak,\nhow the many tyrannized the few,\nhow the cunning deceived the simple,\nhow the brave overcame the timid—\nand how the wise hoarded knowledge without teaching,\nhow the rich accumulated wealth without sharing.\nThus they established the **Son of Heaven** to unify all,\nfor one mind cannot illuminate all-under-Heaven,\nso they appointed the **Three Ministers** and **Nine Officials** to assist,\nfor isolated states and distant customs could not receive his blessings,\nso they installed the **feudal lords** to instruct them.\nThus Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—\nnone fail to respond.\nNo office hides its duties,\nno state neglects its benefits—\nthus the cold are clothed, the hungry fed,\nthe aged and weak cared for,\nthe weary rested—\nnone are left unprovided for.\nIs the **Son of Heaven** then the heart of Heaven and Earth?\nThe vastness of the land, the multitude of the people—\nwithout a ruler to govern them,\nthe strong oppress the weak,\nthe many tyrannize the few,\nthe cunning deceive the simple,\nand the people cannot live in peace.\nThus the **Son of Heaven** is established,\nthe **Three Ministers** appointed,\nto be parents to the people,\nnurturing and guiding them.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*'The later sovereigns completed Heaven and Earth’s **Dao**,\nsupplemented what Heaven and Earth lacked,\ngoverning the people left and right—\nthus the heart of Heaven and Earth becomes visible.'*\n\n**Shennong**’s body withered,\n**Yao**’s limbs were emaciated,\n**Shun**’s skin darkened from exposure,\n**Yu**’s feet were calloused and cracked.\n**Yi Yin** carried a caldron to serve **Tang**,\n**Jiang Ziya** wielded a butcher’s cleaver before entering **Zhou**,\n**Bai Li Xi** was sold into slavery,\n**Guan Zhong** was bound in chains,\n**Confucius** lacked even a single loyal follower,\n**Mozi** had no warm bed—\nnot for greed of office or love of rank,\nbut to awaken the benefits of all-under-Heaven,\nto eliminate the harms of the myriad people.\nFrom the **Son of Heaven** to the commoner,\nnone escape laboring with their bodies,\nnone escape the strain of thought—\nsuch is the way of seeking sufficiency in affairs.\nThe ancient sages’ ears, eyes, mouths, and noses were no different from others,\ntheir hunger, thirst, cold, and warmth no different—\nwhat differed was their **heart**.\nThey established the ultimate **principle** for all generations of living beings.\nAll who stand among the sages\nrarely achieve their deeds without first exhausting their **heart-mind**,\nyet when their deeds are done, they do not claim them—\nthis is what makes them sage.\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*\"What is called the **Son of Heaven** is one who establishes all-under-Heaven with the **Dao** of Heaven.\nThe **Dao** of establishing all-under-Heaven\nholds to **Oneness** as its safeguard,\nreturns to the root with **non-action**,\nis **empty** and **still** without possession,\nfaint and boundless without end,\nfar-reaching without cessation—\nseen, it has no form;\nheard, it has no sound.\nThis is called the **classic course** of the **Great Dao**.\"*\n\nThe heavens and earth are the great parents of humankind.\nAll who bear blood and qi are the children of Heaven, with the sovereign as their leader, acting as Heaven’s deputy son.\nHence the title *Son of Heaven*.\n\nThe *Son of Heaven* regards the people as his own children—\nif he does not neglect what nourishes them,\nthen Heaven’s gaze and Heaven’s hearing respond,\nand this mutual resonance is called the *classic course* of the *Great Dao*.\n\n**Laozi** says:\nThe *Dao* embodies roundness yet follows square law,\nbacks the yin while embracing the yang,\nholds softness to the left and firmness to the right,\nwalks in darkness while wearing brightness,\ntransforms without constancy—\nwhen grasped in its original essence, it adapts to all directions.\nThis is called *divine illumination*.\n\nThe heavens are round yet have no end—\nthus their form cannot be observed.\nThe earth is square yet has no boundary—\nthus no one can peer into its gate.\nHeaven’s transformations flow without shape,\nthe earth’s growth extends without measure.\n\nThings may have their masters,\nbut the *Dao* has none—\nfor it has no fixed form or power.\nIts revolutions are endless,\nlike the sun and moon’s ceaseless motion,\nor the seasons’ unending succession—\nday and night, light and dark,\nend and begin, manifest yet formless,\nthus its work is accomplished.\nIt nurtures all things yet is not bound by them—\nthus it conquers without being overcome.\n\nThe *Dao* gives birth to heaven and earth,\nheaven and earth give birth to humankind,\njust as an ancestor begets a father,\nand the father begets a child.\nQi and spirit interact to shape myriad forms,\nyet the *Dao* remains singular.\n\nThe *Dao* is formless, yet the body has form—\nhe who shapes form is formless,\nhe who commands things is not bound by them.\nHow divine!\n\nThe *regal warrior* is an emperor,\nthe *spirit-transformer* is a king.\nThe *regal warrior* follows the *Dao* of Heaven,\nthe *spirit-transformer* harmonizes the four seasons,\nrectifies order within his lands,\nand distant realms embrace his virtue.\nHe secures victory before battle,\nand the feudal lords submit in homage.\n\nThe ancient *Dao*-adepts, when still, conformed to heaven and earth,\nwhen active, followed the sun and moon,\ntheir joys and angers aligned with the seasons,\ntheir commands resounded like thunder,\ntheir voice and qi did not clash with the eight winds,\ntheir yielding and firmness did not alter the five tones.\n\nThey guided the people’s desires,\nharnessed their strength,\nand removed their tyrants and calamities.\nThose who share benefits die for one another,\nthose who share grief aid one another,\nthose who walk the same path assist one another.\nMove according to your own nature,\nand the world will fight for you.\nThus, the skilled warrior uses what the enemy uses against itself—\nthe unskilled warrior forces the enemy to serve his own ends.\nUsing what the enemy uses against itself,\nthe world cannot resist—\nbut forcing the enemy to serve your own ends,\nno one can be compelled.\n\nWhen the sun and moon lose their brilliance, there is an eclipse;\nwhen yin and yang lose harmony, there is war.\nWar brings injury to things.\n\nThe *regal warrior* rules with the emperor’s robes—\nthe world is governed.\nThe *spirit-transformer* returns his troops in triumph—\nthe people’s suffering ceases.\n\nIf Jie had received proper governance,\nthe battlefield at Muye would have been silent—\nhow could he have exploited the people’s desires\nand used their strength\nwhile abandoning his own lord?\nIt is only because the people had all abandoned their hearts\nthat one does not say *\"regicide\"* but *\"removing tyrants and calamities.\"*\n\nAlas.\n\n*End of Volume Eight of the Continuation of the True Mystic Classic’s Meaning.*\n\n**Volume Nine of *The Continuation of the True Mystic Classic’s Meaning*\n*Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*\n*The Chapter on Lower Virtue***\n\nLaozi says:\nTo govern oneself, the highest is to nurture the spirit, the next is to nurture the form. When the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil, all limbs are at ease—this is the foundation of life-nurturing.\nTo plump the flesh and fill the belly, to indulge desires—this is the superficiality of life-nurturing.\n\nTo govern the realm, the highest is to nurture the transformation of the people, the next is to rectify the laws. When the people naturally yield to one another, vie for humility, compete to receive less profit, and vie to undertake labor, day by day they transform toward the superior and abandon their old ways without knowing why—this is the foundation of governance.\nWhen rewards are generous and thus virtue is encouraged, when punishments are feared and thus wrongdoing is avoided, when laws are properly established above and the people submit below—this is the superficiality of governance.\n\nIn ancient times, the focus was on the foundation; in later times, on the superficial. Lower virtue is the rigid adherence to virtue.\n\nThe highest in governing oneself is to nurture the spirit—this is the foundation of self-cultivation. The next is to nurture the form—this is the superficiality of self-cultivation.\nThe highest in governing the realm is to nurture the transformation of the people—this is the foundation of governance. The next is to rectify the laws—this is the superficiality of governance.\nDescending further, there are still those beneath lower virtue.\n\nLaozi says: The ruler who seeks to govern does not appear in every age; the capable minister who can assist him is not found in every ten thousand. To seek such a minister with a ruler who appears so rarely is why perfect governance is not achieved even once in a thousand years.\n\nThe achievements of hegemons and kings are not established in every age. If one follows the people’s good intentions and guards against their corrupt hearts, sharing with them the same Dao, then the people can be made virtuous, and customs refined.\nWhat makes the sage noble is not his imposition of punishments for crimes, but his understanding of where disorder arises.\nIf one opens the sharp inclinations of the people and follows them into licentiousness and excess, then abandons them to the law and punishes them with penalties—even if they ravage the world, their deceit cannot be restrained.\n\nThe gathering of wise and virtuous leaders is a chance encounter once in a thousand years.\nThe sage ruler does not appear in every age; the capable minister is not found in every ten thousand. When a ruler who appears so rarely obtains even one such minister—from the Tang and Yu onward, like Tang’s encounter with Yi Yin or Wen Wang’s with Lü Wang—such instances are rare in history.\nEven figures like Guan Zhong under Qi Huan are not common.\nThus, governance flourishes rarely, while disorder prevails often—perhaps because virtuous men are few while the petty are many?\n\nLaozi says: To dwell above the lakes and rivers while one’s heart is beneath the imperial gate—this is to cherish life.\nTo cherish life is to disregard profit lightly.\nYet if one cannot overcome oneself and instead indulges, the spirit suffers no harm.\nIf one cannot overcome oneself and yet forcibly resists, this is called severe injury.\nThose who suffer severe injury will not live long.\nThus it is said:\nTo know harmony is to know constancy;\nTo know constancy is to know clarity;\nTo benefit life is auspicious;\nTo let the heart command the qi is strength—\nThis is called *Xuan Tong* (Mysterious Harmony).\nTo use its radiance and return to its clarity.\nHumans have careers and retirement;\nThe Dao knows no bending or stretching.\nThough one’s body may be in the lakes and rivers while the heart is at the imperial gate, one does not forget the fields.\nThus, those who embody the Dao retire with this Dao, act with this Dao—when the time is to stop, they stop; when the time is to act, they act.\nThis is called *Xuan Tong*.\n\nLaozi says: Nothing is easier than doing good, nothing harder than doing evil.\nWhat is called easy to do as good is to remain still and do nothing, to follow nature’s excess without enticement, to preserve one’s true self without alteration—thus it is said that doing good is easy.\nWhat is called hard to do as evil is usurpation, regicide, arrogance, and licentiousness—restless and desiring much, contrary to human nature—thus it is said that doing evil is hard.\nWhat is now considered a great calamity arises from the absence of moderation and measure.\nThus, in places of gain and harm, at the juncture of fortune and misfortune, one must be discerning.\nThe sage has no desires, no avoidance.\nIf one desires something, it is enough to lose it;\nIf one avoids something, it is enough to invite it.\nWhen the will desires, one forgets what one is doing.\nThus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness, adapts to the measure of giving and receiving,\nbalances the emotions of love and hate,\nharmonizes the rhythms of joy and anger.\nWhen action and stillness are appropriate, calamity does not intrude;\nWhen giving and receiving are measured, guilt does not accumulate;\nWhen love and hate are balanced, worry does not approach;\nWhen joy and anger are harmonized, resentment does not arise.\nGood and evil differ in appearance but share the same origin in the heart.\nNothing is easier than doing good, nothing harder than doing evil.\nThe steps to fortune and misfortune are uncertain—what one seeks to gain is lost, what one seeks to avoid is encountered.\nThus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness,\nharmonizes the rhythms of joy and anger,\nand in all things does no wrong—what cause is there for resentment?\nThose who embody the Dao do not greedily take what they should not,\ndo not reject what they possess.\nThey are always full yet never overflowing,\nconstantly empty yet easily sustained.\nThus, if one aligns with Daoist principles and measures,\nfood suffices to fill the empty,\nclothing suffices to ward off cold,\nand the body of seven spans is kept warm and nourished.\nWithout Daoist principles and measures,\neven the power of a great kingdom is insufficient for satisfaction,\nand the wealth of the world is insufficient for joy.\nThus the sage maintains a tranquil heart and easy will,\nguards the spirit within,\nand external things cannot deceive.\nThere is a method to cultivating oneself and an art to navigating the world.\nThose who embody the Dao uphold their natural endowment,\nfind ease in their fate,\nand eat only to fill the empty,\nclothe themselves only to ward off cold.\nThey do not greedily take what they should not,\ndo not abandon what they possess.\nMisfortune cannot be avoided, but fortune is not sought recklessly.\nIn prosperity, they do not grow arrogant;\nin adversity, they do not abandon their principles.\nThey take joy in the natural state,\nand endure with the Dao.\n\nLaozi said:\n\n*\"He who overcomes others has strength,\nbut he who overcomes himself is strong.\nTo be strong, one must use others’ strength;\nto use others’ strength, one must win their hearts;\nto win their hearts, one must first be self-mastered.\nNever has one gained others while losing oneself,\nnor has one lost oneself while gaining others.\n\nThus, the foundation of governance lies in calming the people;\nthe foundation of calming the people lies in ensuring their sufficiency;\nthe foundation of sufficiency lies in not disrupting the natural order;\nthe foundation of not disrupting the natural order lies in simplifying affairs;\nthe foundation of simplifying affairs lies in moderating expenditure;\nthe foundation of moderating expenditure lies in eliminating arrogance;\nthe foundation of eliminating arrogance lies in embracing emptiness and non-being.\n\nTherefore, those who understand the nature of life do not strive for what cannot be attained;\nthose who understand the nature of fate do not strive for what cannot be controlled.\nThe eyes indulge in the five colors,\nthe mouth craves the five flavors,\nthe ears revel in the five tones—\nthe seven orifices vie in conflict,\nharming the singular essence.\nDaily indulging in perverse desires exhausts one’s natural harmony,\nand even the body cannot be governed—\nhow then can one govern the world?\n\nTo conquer others, first conquer oneself.\nNone can conquer others without first conquering themselves.\nHe who conquers others relies on force,\nbut he who conquers himself is strong—\nfor reason conquers desire.\nWhen reason prevails, one wins the hearts of others,\nand people willingly lend their strength.\nWhen desire prevails, one exploits others’ strength,\nand people withdraw their loyalty.\nThe distinction between Heaven’s principle and human desire is profound.\n\nSo-called mastery of the world does not mean occupying high rank or bearing a noble title,\nbut rather aligning with the will of the world and harnessing its strength.\nTo hold the title of king yet lack the people’s trust is to have lost the world.\nThus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings,\nwhile Tang and Wu were not rebels.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven embodies the Dao, his authority rests with the four quarters;\nwhen he loses the Dao, his authority is held by the feudal lords.\nWhen a feudal lord embodies the Dao, his authority extends to the borders;\nwhen he loses the Dao, his authority is confined to his inner circle.\nThus it is said:\nDo not rely on others not taking what is yours—\nrely instead on making it impossible for them to take it.\nTo walk the path of what can be seized is not the way of a usurper or regicide,\nyet it profits nothing in securing the world.\nPetting me brings loyalty; oppressing me breeds enmity.\nThe sage aligns with the world’s will, harnesses its strength,\nand thus the world is governed.\nAs for tyrants like Jie and Zhou—\nthough they bear the title of king, they lack even one loyal subject—\nthis is why Tang and Wu refused to serve them.\nWhen the world loses the Dao, the feudal lords become its guardians—\nwhose fault is this?\n\nLaozi said:\nThe wise ruler does not alter what is established,\nnor does he abandon what is constant.\nAnger defies virtue,\nwar is a cruel instrument,\nand strife is the source of disorder.\nTo scheme in secrecy defies virtue,\nto favor weapons of destruction exacerbates disorder—\nthis is the height of perverting human chaos.\nNone can bring ruin to others without first inviting ruin upon themselves.\nDo not sharpen the blade to its edge,\ndo not stoke the flames to their height,\nsoften the light, blend with the dust.\n\nHuman nature longs to excel over others\nand resents those who surpass them.\nThis longing breeds contention,\nthis resentment breeds strife.\nStrife disturbs the mind and disrupts the qi.\nThus, ancient sage-kings eliminated contention and resentment,\nand with their absence, the mind was at peace and the qi flowed harmoniously.\nHence it is said:\nDo not exalt the virtuous—\nso that the people do not contend.\nWhen contention is insufficient, yielding is abundant—\nthis is the path of mutual benefit for self and others.\n\nAnger defies virtue,\nwar is a cruel instrument,\nand strife is the source of disorder.\nTo scheme in secrecy defies virtue,\nto favor weapons of destruction exacerbates disorder—\nthis is the height of perverting human chaos.\nWenzhongzi transmitted these words to Fan Li.\nWhen Yue sought to attack Wu, Li cited them in counsel,\nbut Goujian did not heed them and was defeated at Fuqiao.\nThus, those who seek to harm others only harm themselves.\nWould the virtuous act thus?\n\nLaozi said:\nTo govern things, one does not rely on things to achieve harmony;\nto govern harmony, one does not rely on harmony to govern people;\nto govern people, one does not rely on people to govern the ruler;\nto govern the ruler, one does not rely on the ruler to govern desire;\nto govern desire, one does not rely on desire to govern nature;\nto govern nature, one does not rely on nature to govern virtue;\nto govern virtue, one does not rely on virtue to govern the Dao.\nRooting the Dao in humanity’s nature,\nfree from corruption, enduring in all things,\none forgets its origin and merges with its true form.\nClothing, food, rites, and customs are not innate to human nature—\nthey are acquired from without.\nThus, human nature is inherently balanced,\nwhile cravings disrupt it.\nOnly those who embody the Dao can abandon external influences and return to the self.\nWith self-awareness, one does not lose sight of things’ true nature;\nwithout it, one acts in confusion and agitation.\nTo indulge desire is to lose one’s nature—\nactions never align with the true path,\ngoverning life leads to self-ruin,\nand governing the state sows discord among the people.\nThus, those who do not hear the Dao cannot return to their nature.\nNature and desire are inherently distinct.\nAll people are thus, but rulers are especially so.\n\nTo govern things without relying on things to achieve harmony,\none must first clarify one’s own nature,\nthen clarify the nature of things.\nTo clarify the nature of things is to assist in nurturing and harmonizing with Heaven and Earth.\nAncient sage-kings attained this within themselves,\nthus their commands were obeyed and prohibitions respected.\nIn all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and purify the spirit.\nWhen the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil,\nonly then can affairs be set aright.\nIf judgment is clouded by praise or blame,\nif the eyes are dazzled by color,\nhow can affairs be rectified?\nThus, emptiness is prized.\n\nWater, when stirred, creates waves;\nqi, when disordered, clouds the mind.\nA clouded mind cannot discern what is right,\nand waves cannot settle into stillness.\nThus, the sage-kings held fast to the One\nto govern the emotions and natures of things.\nThe One is the most precious—\nunmatched in the world.\nThe sage-king entrusted himself to the formless,\nthus commanding the world.\n\nAncient scholars cultivated for themselves,\nestablishing the path of self-cultivation\nbefore enacting the path for others.\"*\n\nThe Sage attains all within himself,\nthus clarity and luminosity reside in his person—\nnothing distant escapes his discernment.\nHe comprehends the nature of all things,\nand his commands flow throughout the world.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Yin and yang mold all things,\nall riding upon the One qi to arise.\nWhen above and below lose harmony,\nqi ascends in turmoil;\nwhen ruler and subject are discordant,\nthe five grains fail to ripen.\nSpring’s austerity and autumn’s flourishing,\nwinter’s thunder and summer’s frost—\nall are born of perverse qi.\"*\n\nBetween heaven and earth lies a single body;\nwithin the six directions, a single form.\nThus, those clear in their nature\ncannot be coerced by heaven and earth;\nthose precise in their correspondences\ncannot be deceived by strange things.\n\nThe Sage knows the near to grasp the far,\nunifying all differences into oneness.\nWhen qi steams through heaven and earth,\nand rites, propriety, shame, and music are not established,\npeople do not harm or oppress one another—\nthis arises from their state of undifferentiated obscurity.\n\nWhen shame and modesty decline in the age’s decay,\nwhen expenditures exceed resources,\nwhen labor is excessive yet sustenance is insufficient,\nthe people grow impoverished and resentful, spawning strife—\nthus, *ren* (virtue) is prized.\n\nWhen people are coarse and unaligned,\nforming cliques and factions,\neach advancing their own,\nharboring cunning and deceit—\nthus, *yi* (righteousness) is prized.\n\nWhen men and women dwell together without distinction,\nthus, *li* (rites) is prized.\n\nWhen the nature of life and death is abandoned,\nand desires press upon one another without restraint,\ndisharmony ensues—\nthus, *yue* (music) is prized.\n\nTherefore, *ren, yi, li, yue* are means to remedy defects,\nnot the path of comprehensive governance.\n\nHeaven and earth are one body,\nthe world is one qi.\nYang transforms, yin nurtures,\nmolding all things,\nall riding upon the One qi to arise.\n\nThe Sage cherishes and nourishes the people,\nviewing them as one family—\nthus, the world attains peace.\n\nIf expenditures exceed resources,\nlabor is excessive yet sustenance is insufficient,\nthe people grow impoverished and resentful, spawning strife—\nthis is not the path of comprehensive governance.\n\nIf one can establish clarity and luminosity throughout the world,\nand return the heart to its origin,\nthen human nature is good.\nWhen human nature is good,\nthen heaven and earth’s yin and yang enfold it naturally—\nthus, resources suffice and the people are ample,\nwhile greedy, vulgar, and contentious hearts cannot arise.\n*Ren* and *yi* are not employed,\nyet *dao* and *de* are established throughout the world,\nand the people are not dazzled by color.\n\nThus, when *de* declines, only then are *ren* and *yi* adorned;\nwhen harmony is lost, only then is music adjusted;\nwhen rites are excessive, only then is decorum adorned.\nHence, knowing *dao* and *de*,\none then knows that *ren* and *yi* are insufficient to enact;\nknowing *ren* and *yi*,\none then knows that *li* and *yue* are insufficient to cultivate.\n\nThe Sage, sincere and clear, returns to the origin of nature—\nthe people revert to goodness.\nWhen human nature is good,\nheaven and earth’s yin and yang enfold it naturally,\nresources suffice, the people are ample,\ngreed and vulgarity do not arise,\nand strife subsides.\n*Ren* and *yi* are not employed,\nyet *dao* and *de* are established throughout the world.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Governance through clarity and stillness—\nharmonious and tranquil, yet profound and vast,\nauthentic and unadorned, serene and unhurried.\nWithin, it aligns with the Dao;\nwithout, it conforms to righteousness.\nIts speech is concise yet follows principle,\nits actions persuasive yet accord with human nature,\nits heart harmonious yet unfeigned,\nits deeds natural yet undecorated.\nIt does not plot beginnings nor deliberate ends.\nAt ease, it remains; provoked, it acts.\nIt permeates heaven and earth,\nharmonizes with yin and yang’s essence,\nunifies with the four seasons,\nshines with the clarity of sun and moon,\nand aligns with those who transform with the Dao.\nCunning, deceit, and artifice\nare not harbored in the heart.\nThus, heaven covers with *de*,\nearth bears with music,\nthe four seasons never fail their order,\nwinds and rains do not act tyrannically,\nthe sun and moon remain clear and radiant,\nthe five stars follow their courses—\nthis is the luminosity of clarity and stillness.\nWhen heaven is clear and earth is still,\nonly then can endurance be sustained.\nThe Sage governs through clarity and stillness,\nimitating heaven and earth.\nA clear heart aligns within with the Dao,\na still body conforms without to humanity.\nThus, transformation spreads without leaving home.\"*\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The duties of governing in a well-ordered age are easy to uphold,\nits affairs easy to enact,\nits rites easy to practice,\nits responsibilities easy to fulfill.\nThus, one person does not hold multiple offices,\nand one office does not oversee multiple tasks.\nFarmers, scholars, artisans, and merchants\nare distinguished by their districts and states.\nThus, farmers speak to farmers of storage,\nscholars to scholars of conduct,\nartisans to artisans of skill,\nmerchants to merchants of calculation—\nso scholars lack no virtue in conduct,\nartisans no toil in craft,\nfarmers no neglect in labor,\nmerchants no loss in trade.\nEach finds ease in their nature.\nThough forms and kinds differ,\ntheir tasks are simple yet not contradictory.\nIf one’s calling is lost, they are held in contempt;\nif one’s aspirations are fulfilled, they are honored.\nAnciently, people held a single office,\nand each office managed a single task—\nthus, the ministers of a well-ordered age\nfound their duties easy to uphold,\ntheir tasks easy to enact.\nIn later ages, the practice of holding multiple offices and shared duties arose.\nOfficials multiplied, records proliferated,\npolicies issued from many doors—\ncontrary measures undermined governance.\nThose with foresight and distant vision\npossess great talent,\nyet in a well-ordered age, such abilities are not demanded of the people.\nThose well-versed in literature and resolute in purpose,\neloquent and articulate,\npossess abundant knowledge,\nyet an enlightened ruler does not seek them from below.\nThose who disdain the age and devalue things,\nnot conforming to convention,\nexemplify scholarly integrity—\nyet in a well-ordered age, such conduct is not used to transform the people.\nThus, the unattainable is not set as a standard for people,\nand the unapproachable is not made the custom of the state.\nHence, talent cannot be monopolized by measure,\nbut Dao and technique can be transmitted through the ages.\nThus, national laws can be entrusted to the unlearned,\nand military campaigns can be conducted by uniform methods.\nWithout awaiting ancient sages, people suffice as they are—\nutilizing what they possess and combining their strengths.\n\nThe laws of the decadent age\nset lofty standards yet fail to reach them,\nimpose heavy burdens yet cannot bear them,\ndemand the impossible yet dare not punish.\nThe people, burdened by triple responsibilities,\nadorn their cunning to deceive above,\ncommit crimes and court danger—\nthough laws are severe and punishments harsh,\nthey cannot suppress their deceit.\nWhen beasts are cornered, they strike;\nwhen birds are cornered, they peck;\nwhen people are cornered, they deceive—\nthis is what is meant.\"*\n\n「Thus, talent cannot surpass virtue, nor words outdo deeds. Those with abundant talent yet prescient insight are not held accountable in times of governance; those with vast learning yet eloquent deceit are not sought by enlightened rulers.\n\nThe proud and self-righteous, who burden others with impossible tasks and demand what they themselves cannot perform, how could they avoid the deceit of desperate people? Laozi says:\n\nThe thunderous voice of *léitíng* can be likened to bells and drums;\nthe shifts of wind and rain can be known through music and rhythm.\n\nWhat is grand and visible can be measured;\nwhat is bright and discernible can be obscured;\nwhat is audible can be tuned;\nwhat is colored can be distinguished.\n\nYet the utmost grandeur of heaven and earth cannot be contained,\nand the subtlest essence of *shénmíng* cannot be fully grasped.\n\nWhen establishing calendars and measures,\ndistinguishing the five colors,\ndiscriminating clear and turbid,\ntasting sweet and bitter—\nthen the *pǔ* scatters and becomes tools.\n\nWhen establishing *rényì* and cultivating rites and music,\nthen virtue shifts and becomes artifice.\n\nThe people adorn their cleverness to deceive the simple,\nemploy deceit to attack their superiors—\nyet though some may uphold it, none can govern through it.\n\nFor when wisdom grows ever more intricate while virtue decays,\nthe truly great remain pure and unadorned, yet do not scatter.\n\nThe Sage carves from the *Dàpǔ* (Great Purity),\naligning with heaven and earth,\nobserving the patterns to craft tools—\nas thunder and lightning are to bells and drums,\nas wind and rain are to music and rhythm,\nall are shaped from their likeness.\n\nYet as vast as heaven and earth,\nas subtle as *shénmíng*,\nthere are limits to what can be fully explored.\n\nOnly the truly great remain pure and unadorned,\nyet can serve as teachers for all ages.\nLaozi says:\n\nThe governance of the truly great is empty and tranquil,\nwithout visible desire,\nas *shén* (spirit) and *xìng* (nature) align,\nand form harmonizes with *qì* (vitality).\nIn stillness, the body attains;\nin motion, the *lǐ* (principles) flow—\nfollowing the Dao of natural spontaneity,\nas circumstances demand.\n\nIndifferent and without contrivance, yet the world is in accord;\ndetached and without desire, yet the people return to simplicity.\nNo quarreling, yet resources suffice.\n\nThe giver does not claim virtue,\nthe receiver does not refuse—\nvirtue returns naturally,\nand none can hinder it.\n\nDebate without words,\nthe Way without teaching—\nif one attains this,\nit is called *Tiānfǔ* (Heaven’s Treasury).\nTaking from it without depletion,\ndrawing from it without exhaustion—\nnone know its source,\nthis is called *Yáoguāng* (Shaking Light).\n*Yáoguāng* is the nourishment of all things.\n\nThe *Běichén* (North Star) is the exalted sovereign of heaven.\nFirmly seated at the center of the celestial sphere,\nall stars bow before it.\n\nThe truly great take the Way as their model,\nas *shén* and *xìng* align,\nindifferent and without contrivance,\nyet the world is in accord.\n\n*Yáoguāng* resides in the ladle of the Big Dipper,\nnourishing all things,\nrevolving leftward with the heavens,\nas the sun completes its daily cycle.\n\nWhen the Dipper does not descend its blessings,\nthe people are sustained in their sustenance.\nShun observed the *Xuánjī* (the rotating stars) to regulate the seven celestial officials—\nwas not his understanding of heaven profound?\n\nLaozi says:\n\nHeaven cherishes its *jīng* (refined essences),\nearth its *píng* (levelness),\nhumans their *qíng* (affections).\n\nThe *jīng* of heaven are the sun, moon, stars,\nthunder, lightning, wind, and rain.\nThe *píng* of earth are water, fire, metal, wood, and soil.\nThe *qíng* of humans are thought, perception, cleverness, and the emotions of joy and anger.\n\nThus, closing the four gates,\nrectifying the five pathways#12,\none aligns with the Dao.\n\n*Shénmíng* is hidden in the formless,\n*jīngqì* returns to its true essence.\nThe eyes are bright yet do not gaze,\nthe ears are keen yet do not listen,\nthe speech is apt yet does not speak,\nthe mind is lucid yet does not deliberate—\nabandoning yet not acting,\nknowing yet not boasting,\nfollowing the natural inclinations of life,\nyet understanding that harm is inevitable.\n\nWhen *jīng* resides in the eyes, their vision is clear;\nwhen it lingers in the ears, their hearing is acute;\nwhen it stays in the mouth, their speech is precise;\nwhen it gathers in the heart, their thoughts are profound.\n\nThus, closing the four gates,\none remains free from harm all their life—\nthe four limbs and nine orifices neither die nor live,\nthis is called the *Zhēnrén* (True Person).\n\nThe earth’s production of wealth\nhas no greater foundation than the five phases.\nThe Sage regulates the five phases,\nand governance remains unerring.\n\nHumans possess five *xìng* (natures) corresponding to heaven,\nand five stars corresponding to earth.\nWhen the five phases and five natures move,\nthe seven emotions arise—\nhow could one not love their body?\n\nThe spirit dwells in the heart,\nthe refined essence in the kidneys,\nthe *hún* (ethereal soul) in the liver,\nthe *pò* (corporeal soul) in the lungs,\nthe intention in the spleen,\nand *shénmíng* in the formless.\n\nNeither giving life nor ceasing it,\nthis is called the *Zhēnrén* (True Person).\n\nLaozi says:\n\nThe balance between left and right\nhas no partiality in lightness or weight,\nthus it can serve as *píng* (level).\n\nThe plumb line within and without\nhas no partiality in crookedness or straightness,\nthus it can serve as *zhèng* (rectitude).\n\nThe ruler’s laws\nhave no partiality in favor or dislike,\nthus they can serve as *lìng* (command).\n\nVirtue has no fixed foundation,\ngrudges have no place to hide—\nthis is to follow the Dao and unite human hearts.\n\nThus, those who govern\nknow not to interfere.\n\nWater overwhelms and shatters the boat,\nwood strikes and snaps the axle—\nyet they do not blame water and stone,\nbut punish the clumsy and the unskilled—\nthis is not wisdom.\n\nHence, when the Dao has wisdom, it brings chaos;\nwhen virtue has intent, it becomes perilous;\nwhen the heart has eyes, it grows dizzy.\n\nThe *quánhéng guījǔ* (weights and measures, square and compass)\nare fixed and unchanging,\never consistent and never deviating,\never straight and never lingering.\n\nOnce shaped, they endure for ten thousand ages—\nthis is the Way of non-action.\n\nHumans have partial inclinations,\nand none can avoid harming the Dao.\n\nThe ruler without partiality,\nthus the law is singular and commands are obeyed.\n\nHence, when virtue has intent, it becomes perilous;\nwhen the heart has eyes, it grows dizzy.\n\nKnowing that *quánhéng guījǔ* are fixed and unchanging,\nthen one knows that the singular is the Way of non-action.\n\nA hundred rulers employed it,\nten thousand ages transmitted it.\n\nLaozi says:\n\nPeople say:\n\"A kingdom has a doomed sovereign,\nbut the world lacks a doomed Dao.\"\n\nHumans may be desperate,\nyet the principles of the Dao remain unbroken.\nThus, those who follow non-action,\nare the essence of the Dao.\n\nAttaining the essence of the Dao,\none responds to all things without end.\nHence, they do not rely on the Dao’s myriad principles,\nnor monopolize their own abilities—\ntheir limits are not distant.\n\nThe sovereign does not step outside their door\nyet knows the world—\nby observing things to discern things,\nand by observing people to know people.»\n\nThus, when one accumulates the strength of what can be raised,\nthere is nothing it cannot overcome.\nWhen the wisdom of the multitude is employed,\nthere is nothing it cannot accomplish.\nA thousand-strong force lacks no provisions,\na ten-thousand-strong host lacks no function.\n\nCraftsmen have no divergent skills,\nscholars hold no dual offices,\neach guards their station,\nand none may overstep—\npeople find their proper place,\nthings find their proper rest.\nThus, tools are not ill-used,\nand duties are not neglected.\nDebts are few and easily repaid,\nduties are few and easily upheld.\nBurdens are light and easily encouraged.\nThe sovereign governs with minimal measures,\nwhile the people achieve great deeds,\nso ruler and subjects do not weary of one another.\n\nHeaven does not govern itself—there are those who govern as Heaven,\nEarth does not govern itself—there are those who govern as Earth.\nWho are these \"those\"?\nThere are doomed sovereigns, but no doomed Dao.\n\nYī Yǐn five times approached Jié but was not used,\nfor he relied on his own abilities\nand did not know the Way of aligning with others.\nThus, Yī Yǐn did not serve Xià but served Tāng instead.\nCould Xià not have perished?\nCould Tāng not have risen?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe *Emperor* embodies the *Tàiyī* [Ultimate One],\nthe *King* follows the *Yīnyáng* [yin-yang],\nthe *Conqueror* aligns with the *Four Seasons*,\nthe *Lord* applies the *Six Lü* [musical pitches].\n\nTo embody the *Tàiyī* is to illuminate the nature of Heaven and Earth,\nto harmonize the relationships of virtue and the Dao.\nTo be as luminous as the sun and moon,\nto resonate with all things,\nto balance movement and stillness with yin and yang,\nto temper joy and anger with the Four Seasons—\ncovering all things with the Dao,\nbestowing rewards without favor;\neven the smallest creatures,\nfrom the flying moth to the crawling worm,\nall look up to virtue and thrive.\nVirtue flows beyond borders,\nand fame endures through the ages.\n\nTo follow *Yīnyáng* is to inherit the harmony of Heaven and Earth,\nto share brilliance with Heaven and Earth,\nto shine as brightly as the sun and moon,\nto possess spirits as divine as ghosts and gods.\nTo wear the round and tread the square,\nto embrace the plumb line and rest on the level,\nto govern oneself internally,\nto win hearts externally,\nto issue commands—\nand the world follows the wind.\n\nTo align with the *Four Seasons* is to let\nspring generate, summer grow,\nautumn harvest, winter store—\nto give and take with moderation,\nto enter and exit with measure,\nto temper joy and anger, firmness and gentleness,\nwithout straying from principle.\nGentle yet not fragile,\nfirm yet not harsh,\nbroad yet not reckless,\nsolemn yet not perverse—\nto nurture the people with yielding and compliance,\nto embrace the foolish and contain the unworthy,\nwithout partial affection.\n\nTo apply the *Six Lü* is to know\nwhen to give life and when to take it,\nwhen to reward and when to punish,\nwhen to give and when to take—\nfor without these, there is no Dao.\nTo suppress chaos, restrain violence,\nto promote the virtuous and discard the unworthy,\nto rectify and contain for order,\nto repel danger and level the uneven,\nto correct the crooked and establish the straight,\nto illuminate the principles of opening and closing—\nto ride the times and harness the people’s desires,\nthus subduing hearts.\n\nThe *Emperor* who does not embody *Yīnyáng* will be encroached upon;\nthe *King* who does not follow the *Four Seasons* will be diminished;\nthe *Conqueror* who does not apply the *Six Lü* will be humiliated;\nthe *Lord* who loses the plumb line will be deposed.\n\nThus, the small acting as the great\nremains unobstructed even in narrowness;\nthe great acting as the small\nbecomes confined even in vastness.\n\nWhy not call them *Huáng* [August] but instead *Emperor*, *King*, *Conqueror*, *Lord*?\nIt is to honor the *Huáng* [August].\n\nThe *Emperor* loses the Dao and only then virtue,\nthe *King* loses virtue and only then benevolence,\nthe *Conqueror* loses benevolence and only then righteousness,\nthe *Lord* loses righteousness and only then ritual.\nWhen the great stands, the small is present;\nwhen the small stands, the great is lost.\n\nLaozi says:\nGreat territory and many people are not enough for strength;\nstrong armor and sharp weapons cannot guarantee victory;\nhigh walls and deep moats are not enough for defense;\nharsh punishments and severe laws are not enough for awe.\n\nFor those who govern with virtue,\neven smallness ensures survival;\nfor those who govern without virtue,\neven greatness ensures ruin.\n\nThus, the best defenders need no resistance,\nthe best warriors need no battle—\nthey ride the times and follow the people’s desires,\nand take the world.\n\nTherefore, those skilled in governance accumulate *virtue*;\nthose skilled in war cultivate *anger*.\nWhen *virtue* is accumulated, the people can be used;\nwhen *anger* is cultivated, awe can be established.\n\nWhere *culture* reaches deeply, *authority* is widely obeyed;\nwhere *virtue* is broadly applied, *awe* extends far.\nThe broader it is, the stronger we become while the enemy weakens.\n\nThose skilled in war first weaken the enemy, then fight,\nso their expenditures are halved while their gains are tenfold.\n\nA thousand-chariot state that practices *cultural virtue* will reign;\na ten-thousand-chariot state that favors war will perish.\n\nThe victorious army wins before battle,\nthe defeated army fights before seeking victory—\nthis is ignorance of the Dao.\n\nThose who practice *cultural virtue*, though small, endure;\nthose who favor war, though great, perish.\n\nIndeed, those skilled in governance accumulate *virtue*,\nthose skilled in war cultivate *anger*.\nOnly those who know war’s origin use it to stop chaos,\nnot to create it—\nthus the people are unharmed and the state endures long.\n\nAccording to

*Tōng Xuān Zhēn Jīng* (Continuation of the *True Scripture of the Mystic Dao*), Volume Ten**\n**Southern Valley Master Du Dàojiān’s Compilation**\n**The Chapter on Supreme Benevolence**\n\n**Laozi says:**\nThe Dao of the noble one is to cultivate stillness to refine the self, and frugality to nourish life.\nStillness prevents the lower ranks from disturbance; frugality prevents the people from grievance.\nWhen the lower ranks are disturbed, governance falters; when the people grieve, virtue wanes.\nWhen governance falters, the worthy do not offer counsel;\nwhen virtue wanes, the brave do not fight.\n\nBut a chaotic ruler does otherwise:\nIn a single day, he possesses the wealth of the realm,\ndwelling in the lord’s authority, exhausting the people’s strength\nto indulge the desires of his ears and eyes.\nHis ambitions fix on palaces and pavilions, moats and gardens, fierce beasts and rare curiosities.\nThe poor suffer hunger, while tigers and wolves gorge on fodder;\nthe people freeze, yet the lord’s halls are draped in embroidered silks.\nThus, when the ruler hoards these useless things,\nthe realm’s people lose their natural harmony.\n\nThe supreme benevolent one practices stillness to refine the self,\nfrugality to nourish the people—\nthis is what the noble one must do.\nDisturbance below leads to chaotic governance;\nthe people’s grievance thins virtue—\nthe noble one does not act thus.\n\nHow could one willingly harm what is beneficial to cultivate what is useless,\nhoard what is without use to corrupt what is useful?\n\nLaozi says:\nWithout simplicity, virtue cannot be illuminated;\nwithout tranquility, the distant cannot be attained;\nwithout magnanimity, judgments cannot be decisive.\n\nWith the eyes of the realm to see, the ears of the realm to hear,\nthe wisdom of the realm to deliberate, the strength of the realm to contend—\nthus commands descend to their full extent,\nwhile the sincerity of ministers reaches the sovereign’s ear.\nOfficials act with precision, and ministers gather like spokes to a wheel.\n\nHe does not reward with gifts for joy,\nnor punish with crimes for anger.\nLaws are enforced without cruelty;\nears and eyes are open without deception.\nGood and ill are laid bare daily without obstruction.\nThus the worthy exhaust their wisdom,\nthe unworthy exert their strength,\nthe near find security in their nature,\nthe distant are drawn by virtue—\nthis is the Dao of employing people.\n\nSimplicity, tranquility, magnanimity, and fairness—\nthese are the affairs of benevolent governance.\n\nThe Dao of employing people:\nIf one sees and hears with the eyes and ears of the realm,\nthen clarity and insight are vast;\nif one deliberates and contends with the wisdom and strength of the realm,\nthen achievements are great.\nThus the worthy exhaust their wisdom,\nthe foolish expend their strength,\nthe near are bound by favor,\nthe distant submit to virtue—\nthis is why the Three Dynasties endured,\nwhile later ages could not match them.\n\nHe who rides in carriages and horses\ntravels a thousand *li* without labor;\nhe who sails in boats and junks\ncrosses rivers and seas without exertion.\nIf words are true, even a commoner with a load of firewood\nshould not be discarded;\nif words are false, even a sovereign or minister\nshould not be employed.\nRight and wrong cannot be judged by rank or status.\n\nIf a plan is useful, one does not shame its position;\nif speech is practicable, one does not prize its eloquence.\n\nBut a dark ruler does otherwise:\nFew ministers offer sincere loyalty,\nfor their persons are not employed.\nInstead, he favors the corrupt and crooked;\nthe worthy cannot be seen,\nwhile the distant and lowly, though they exhaust their strength and loyalty,\ncannot be heard.\n\nIf one speaks, he is trapped by words;\nif one remonstrates, he is punished by law.\nYet such a one seeks to pacify the realm and preserve the world—\nhow far he strays from wisdom!\n\nThe Creator lends me existence; if taken, I have none.\nTo borrow is to wield great power indeed.\n\nCarriages and horses replace footsteps,\nboats and junks cross rivers—\nthousand-*li* journeys reached without labor,\nfor their strength is borrowed.\nThe sovereign borrows ministers to govern,\nministers borrow the sovereign to fulfill their ambitions.\nTo lose the use of borrowing is to be a solitary tyrant.\nOnly the enlightened sovereign can attain this.\n\nLaozi says:\nThose who honor life\ndo not, though rich and noble, let nourishment harm the body,\nnor, though poor and lowly, let profit burden the form.\n\nNow, having inherited the noble rank of our ancestors,\nwe must cherish it—\nfor life’s origin is long,\nyet to lose it lightly is bewildering indeed.\n\nThus, if one governs the realm with the body’s virtue,\none can entrust the realm to it;\nif one loves the realm with the body’s virtue,\none can then #2*deposit* the realm with it.\n\nNo one values life more than to honor it.\nTo honor life is to avoid desires that kill the self.\n\nMen receive their ancestors’ blessings yet fail to guard themselves,\nseeking from their sustenance what instead brings ruin to their bodies and families—\nhow much deeper their confusion grows!\n\n**Wénzǐ asked:** What is the root of governing the state?\nLaozi said: The root lies in governing the self.\nNever has it been heard that a disordered self brings order to the state,\nor that a disordered state brings order to the self.\nThus it is said:\nRefine the self, and its virtue becomes genuine.\nThe Dao’s utmost subtlety:\nA father cannot teach it to his son,\nnor a son receive it from his father.\nThus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nthe name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nThe state’s root is the family;\nthe family’s root is the self.\n**Wénzǐ asked** about the foundation of harmonizing the state,\nand Laozi spoke of the root being in governing the self—\nthus, when the self is governed, the family is governed;\nwhen the family is governed, the state is governed.\n\nThe self is like the state;\nthe state is like the self.\nThe *Shījīng* says:\n*\"He who wields the axe to fell the axe—\nhis model is not distant.\"*\n\n**Wénzǐ asked:** What deed makes the people love their ruler?\nLaozi said:\nRule them in due season, and treat them with reverence and caution,\nas if standing at the edge of a precipice,\nas if walking on thin ice.\nBetween heaven and earth,\nthe good are what I nurture,\nthe wicked are what I oppose.\n\nIn ancient times, the ministers of Shang and Xia\nturned against their tyrants, Jié and Zhòu,\nand served Tāng and Wǔ instead;\nthe people of Hòushā\nattacked their own lord\nand submitted to Shénnóng’s rule.\nThus it is said:\nWhat the people fear, one must also fear.\n\nShùn’s virtuous deeds made the realm emulate him.\n**Wénzǐ asked** what deed makes the people love their ruler,\nand Laozi spoke of ruling them in due season,\ntreating them with reverence and caution—\nthe good, I nurture; the wicked, I oppose.\n\nThen it follows that if a ruler treats his ministers like dogs and horses,\nhis ministers will treat him as an enemy.\n\nThe people can both uphold their ruler and overthrow him—\nthis is what makes him worthy of fear.\n\nLaozi said:\nTo govern the great, the Dao cannot be trifled with;\nto rule vast lands, measures cannot be narrow;\nto hold high office, duties cannot be burdensome;\nto lead many people, instruction cannot be harsh.\n\nWhen duties are burdensome, they become difficult to manage;\nwhen laws are harsh, they become difficult to enforce;\nwhen demands are excessive, they become difficult to fulfill.\n\nMeasure an inch, and by the time you reach a *zhàng*,\nthe error will be great;\nweigh a *shú* of grain, and by the time you reach a *dàn*,\nthe excess will be heavy.\n\nBut if you weigh a *dàn* and measure a *zhàng*,\nthe errors will be few.\n\nWhat is broadly measured is easier to govern wisely,\nbut what is minutely debated is difficult to make wise.\n\nThus, what brings no benefit to governance but fosters chaos,\nthe Sage does not do;\nwhat serves no purpose but wastes resources,\nthe wise do not practice.\n\nTherefore, deeds should not be excessive in their demands,\nmatters should not be overcomplicated,\ndemands should not be too many.\n\nWhen deeds are concise, they are easily accomplished;\nwhen matters are simplified, they are easily governed;\nwhen demands are few, they are easily fulfilled.\nWhen entrusted to the people, this is effortless.\n\nThus, petty debates harm principle,\npetty principles undermine the Dao.\nThe Dao, when made small, cannot prevail;\nto prevail, it must be simple.\n\nMeasurements have their breadth and narrowness,\nwisdom has its depth and shallowness.\nTo rule vast lands and many people,\nshallow wisdom and narrow measures are insufficient.\n\nHow much more so for one in high office governing great affairs—\ncould they be entangled in trivialities and laziness?\n\nPetty debates harm principle,\npetty principles harm the Dao—\nthis is the business of the petty man;\nthe noble does not engage in it.\n\nThe river flows far because it meanders,\nthe mountain stands high because it rises gradually,\nthe Dao transforms because it moves with ease.\n\nTo master one skill, to be precise in one matter,\nto excel in one ability—\none may be eloquent in detail,\nbut cannot broadly respond.\n\nThe harmonizer of sounds tightens the small strings\nand loosens the large ones;\nthe organizer of affairs burdens the lowly\nand grants ease to the noble.\n\nThe words of the Dao say:\nVague and indistinct, aligning with Heaven’s might,\nthose who share its *qi* become Emperors,\nthose who share its virtue become Kings,\nthose who share its achievements become Conquerors,\nthose lacking in all three perish.\n\nThus, without speaking, they inspire trust;\nwithout bestowing, they inspire benevolence;\nwithout anger, they inspire awe—\nthis is how they move Heaven’s heart.\n\nTo bestow and yet lack benevolence,\nto speak and yet lack trust,\nto anger and yet lack awe—\nthis is to act through mere appearance.\n\nTherefore, with the Dao to govern,\neven few laws suffice to rule;\nwithout the Dao to govern,\neven many laws suffice only to bring chaos.\n\nThe small vessel fills quickly and cannot endure long;\nthe great vessel matures late but attains lasting life.\n\nThose who share *qi* with Heaven become Emperors,\nthose who share virtue become Kings,\nthose who share achievements become Conquerors,\nthose lacking in all three perish.\n\nThus, when the Dao governs affairs,\nlaws are few yet rule is easy;\nwhen the Dao does not govern,\nlaws are many yet chaos ensues.\n\nLaozi says:\nA whale out of water is dominated by ants;\na ruler who abandons his proper role and contests matters with his ministers is dominated by his officials.\n\nIf a ruler relies on his own ability and despises those who guard their posts—\nlistening only to flatterers while hiding the wise—\nand seizes authority for himself,\nhis intelligence grows constrained while his burdens increase.\n\nWhen schemes fail below, he cannot enforce justice;\nwhen conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain control.\nLacking wisdom to govern, lacking authority to punish,\nhe cannot properly engage with the realm.\n\nJoy and anger show on his face,\ndesires reveal themselves outwardly—\nthen those who guard their posts abandon principle to curry favor,\nand officials pervert the law to follow the wind.\nRewards do not match deeds, punishments do not fit crimes—\nthus superiors and inferiors grow estranged, and ruler and minister harbor resentment.\n\nOfficials grow chaotic, yet wisdom cannot resolve it;\npraise and blame arise, yet clarity cannot illuminate.\nWhen faults are not his own yet he blames himself,\nthe ruler grows ever more exhausted while ministers grow ever more idle.\n\nThis is like a substitute carpenter—\nfew who replace the master carpenter do not injure their hands.\n\nWhen a ruler loses the Dao, he is controlled by his ministers,\njust as a whale out of water is dominated by ants.\n\nThe Way of the ruler lies in appointing the worthy and selecting ministers.\nIf ministers are chosen well, all officials will be upright,\nand the realm will be well-governed.\n\nBut if he abandons his proper role and contests ability with his ministers,\nbefore they can dominate him, he will already be ensnared.\n\nChasing horses in a race, his sinews snap before he can catch up—\nonce mounted, he takes the reins, and the horse obeys below.\nBerlek selects the horse, Wang Liang drives it,\nand the wise ruler rides it—\nwithout effort in guiding or selecting, yet reaching a thousand *li*.\nThis is the art of utilizing others’ strengths.\n\nThe ruler’s Way is to act without doing,\nto establish without preferring.\nTo act is to invite criticism;\nto prefer is to invite flattery.\nCriticism can be seized against him,\nflattery can be used to deceive him.\nHe who relies on his own strength to rule cannot govern the state.\n\nThus, the skilled ruler does not act visibly—\nhis influence is formless.\nOnly those who embody *shen* transformation cannot be overcome.\n\nWhen inner desires are restrained, it is called *jiān* (bolting);\nwhen external evils are blocked, it is called *bì* (closing).\nWith inner bolting and outer closing,\nwhat matter cannot be regulated?\nWith outer closing and inner bolting,\nwhat matter cannot succeed?\n\nThus, without acting yet achieving,\nwithout doing yet accomplishing—\nspeaking without boasting,\nacting without usurping,\nfollowing names to demand reality,\nletting each official attend to his duties,\ntaking \"not knowing\" as the Dao,\nand making restraint the sovereign’s principle—\nthen all official matters will have proper measures.\n\nTo chase horses in a race is for the ruler to contend with ministers in strength;\nto mount the carriage and travel far is to entrust ministers with governance.\nTo act is to invite debate;\nto prefer is to invite flattery—\nonly those who embody *shen* transformation can regulate all affairs,\nprevent private audiences, and ensure officials fulfill their duties with matters properly measured.\n\nLaozi says:\nFood is the people’s foundation;\nthe people are the state’s base.\nThus, the ruler harmonizes with Heaven’s timing,\nexhausts Earth’s resources,\nand employs human effort.\nTherefore, all living things flourish,\nand ten thousand things grow abundant.\n\nIn spring, he cuts the withered;\nin summer, he harvests the fruits;\nin autumn, he stores vegetables and grains;\nin winter, he gathers firewood and steam.\nHe provides for the people—\nin life, no want; in death, no abandoned corpses.\n\nThe ancient kings’ laws forbade:\nhunting in groups without proper tools,\ndraining ponds to fish,\nburning forests to hunt.\nBefore the jackal has sacrificed to the beasts,\nno snares may traverse the wilds;\nbefore the otter has sacrificed to the fish,\nno nets may enter the waters;\nbefore the hawk and falcon have struck,\nno fowling nets may be set in the valleys;\nbefore the grasses and trees have fallen,\nno axes may enter the forests;\nbefore insects have nested,\nno fires may be set in the fields;\npregnant creatures must not be killed,\nnor eggs taken from nests;\nfish under a *chi* in length may not be taken,\npigs and dogs under a year may not be eaten.\n\nThus, all things thrive as if steamed.\nThis is how the ancient kings adapted to the times,\nprepared thoroughly,\nenriched the state,\nand benefited the people.\n\nIt is not that they saw with their eyes and acted with their feet—\nif benefiting the people is never forgotten in the heart,\nthen the people will naturally prepare themselves.\n\nTo enrich the state is to nourish the people.\nThe people are the foundation of life.\nHarmonizing with Heaven’s timing,\nexhausting Earth’s resources,\nemploying human effort—\nthe three *cai* are complete,\nthen all living things flourish,\nten thousand things grow abundant,\nthe people rely on them for sustenance,\nand the state gains its wealth.\n\nIs this not the great Way of generating wealth?\n\nLaozi says:\nIn ancient times, wise rulers\ntook from the people with moderation,\nnourished themselves with restraint,\nand calculated yearly harvests,\nmeasured the people’s stored wealth,\nand knew the numbers of surplus and deficit—\nthen they took only what was sufficient.\nThus, they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed\nand avoided hunger and cold.\n\nTo grieve with the people—\nwhen the state has the hungry, food lacks variety;\nwhen the people have the cold, winter lacks fur-lined robes.\nSharing their joys and sorrows,\nthe realm has no rebellious subjects.\n\nBut a tyrannical ruler does otherwise:\nhe takes from the people without regard for their strength,\ndemands from below without measuring their stores.\nMen and women cannot tend to farming and weaving to fulfill his demands.\nExhausted in labor, depleted in wealth,\nthey have mornings but no evenings,\nand ruler and minister grow mutually resentful.\n\nMoreover, for a person’s livelihood,\none plowman’s labor does not increase ten *mu* of land,\nand even in middle-quality fields, the yield does not exceed four *dan*.\nWives, children, the elderly, and weak depend on it for food.\n\nThe Way of governance unfolds thus:\n\nWhen calamities strike and the people cannot fulfill his demands,\nthen the ruler pities them.\nBut the greedy and cruel tyrant drains his subjects like a fisherman who dries the pond,\nto sate his insatiable desires—\nthen the common folk suffer neither the harmony of Heaven nor the virtue of Earth.\n\nEmperor Yao ruled with compassion for his people as though they were his own,\ntaking from them with moderation and giving with measure—\nthus no one bore ill will toward him,\nand even the humblest could be ennobled.\n\nFor a wise ruler’s governance,\nhe must first assess the year’s abundance or scarcity,\nand gauge the people’s strength or depletion—\nthen take accordingly.\nIf he serves the people without resentment,\nHeaven itself will not reproach him.\n\nThe Master Lao said:\nThe *qi* of Heaven and Earth is nothing greater than harmony.\nHarmony means the balance of yin and yang,\nthe division of day and night.\nThus all things sprout at the Spring Equinox and mature at the Autumn Equinox—\ntheir growth and completion depend on the essence of harmony.\n\nExcessive yin does not generate,\nexcessive yang does not transform—\nonly when yin and yang intermingle\ndoes harmony emerge.\nHence the Sage’s Way is broad yet restrained,\nstern yet warm,\nsoft yet upright,\nfierce yet benevolent.\n\nToo rigid, it breaks;\ntoo yielding, it coils—\nthe true Way lies between hardness and softness.\n\nThe rule of the *guī* (plumb line) is thus:\nIt can be coiled and held,\nunwound and stretched,\nlaid straight yet not rigid—\nlong without bending, short without exhaustion,\nstraight without harshness.\nTherefore the Sage embodies it.\n\nWhen benevolence is extended, it becomes easy—\neasy without authority;\nwhen severity is extended, it becomes fierce—\nfierce without harmony;\nwhen love is extended, it becomes indulgent—\nindulgent without order;\nwhen punishment is extended, it becomes ruinous—\nruinous without distinction.\nThus harmony is most prized.\n\n*Qi* thrives when balanced—\nHeaven and Earth in harmony, and all phenomena manifest;\nyin and yang in harmony, and all things flourish;\nruler and minister in harmony, and the court is governed;\nfather and son in harmony, and the household prospers;\nsuperior and subordinate in harmony, and human affairs succeed;\nthe *róng* (nourishing) and *wèi* (defensive) *qi* in harmony, and the body is at ease.\n\nThe meaning of harmony is vast indeed!\n\nThe Master Lao said:\nThe reason a state endures is because it upholds the Way;\nthe reason it perishes is because it obstructs *lǐ* (principle).\nThus the Sage observes transformations to discern its essence.\n\nVirtue waxes and wanes,\nthe winds stir its first signs.\nHe who upholds the Way, though humble, will prevail;\nhe who shows signs of ruin, though powerful, will fall.\nA state’s destruction is not due to its vastness,\nthe Way’s success is not due to its smallness.\nThus endurance lies in upholding the Way, not in vastness,\nand ruin lies in abandoning the Way, not in smallness.\n\nHence rulers of chaotic states\npursue only territory and wealth,\nnot virtue and righteousness,\nseek only high rank,\nnot the Way and moral power.\nThey abandon what sustains them\nand create what destroys them.\n\nIf the ruler above disrupts the radiance of the Three Lights,\nand the people below lose faith in their sovereign—\nwho can endure?\n\nTherefore the prudent ruler\nneed not prepare against all men.\n\nThe Way that pervades the world is *Dao*,\nthe principle that never alters is *lǐ*.\nThus the Way and principle are the greatest.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, states that uphold the Way flourish,\nthose that lose principle perish.\nTo strive for high rank and vast territory\nwithout cultivating virtue and righteousness\nis like a tree without roots—\nits withering is inevitable.\n\nIn ancient times, rulers who deeply practiced the Way were called virtuous and righteous,\nthose who practiced it shallowly were called benevolent and righteous,\nand those who practiced it superficially were called observant of rites and wise.\nThese six—virtue, righteousness, benevolence, rites, wisdom, and the Way—\nare the cords that bind the state.\n\nTo practice them deeply brings abundant blessings,\nto practice them shallowly brings meager blessings,\nto practice them fully brings universal submission.\n\nIn ancient times, cultivating virtue and righteousness governed the world,\ncultivating benevolence and righteousness governed a state,\nand cultivating rites and wisdom governed a village.\nThe deeper the virtue, the greater the power;\nthe shallower the virtue, the lesser the power.\nThus the Way does not rely on strength or might,\nnor on cunning or competition,\nnor on greed or rivalry for attainment.\n\nIts foundation lies in the world embracing you,\nits victory in the world submitting to you,\nits attainment in the world giving itself to you—\nnot in seizing it for yourself.\n\nHence yielding becomes strength,\nsoftness becomes victory,\nbenevolence and righteousness bring true gain,\nand non-contention means none can contend with you.\nThus the Way in the world\nis like the rivers and seas.\n\nVirtue, righteousness, rites, and wisdom—\nrooted in the heart—\nwhen one man practices them, there are degrees of depth and breadth,\nand their application varies in weight.\nNames arise from reality,\nand the six are thus distinguished.\n\nYet though they differ,\nthe same goodness prevails—\nwhen the superior is good, the inferior dare not fail to be.\n\nLater ages neglected the cultivation of virtue and righteousness,\nrelying instead on coercive power to govern—\nand thus their states grew perilous.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is natural;\nartifice brings its loss.\nReputation is the guest of substance—\nno greater name than that of a ruler.\nIf a ruler has virtue, his name requires no seeking,\nfor the world bestows it upon him.\n\nTo receive it is to embrace it.\nWhat the world embraces is virtue.\nThus it is said:\nThe virtuous ruler, the world embraces;\nthe benevolent ruler, the land embraces;\nthe righteous ruler, the state embraces;\nthe observant of rites, the village embraces.\nWithout these four, the people will not embrace.\nIf they do not embrace, then war is used—\nand war is the perilous Way.\n\nThus it is said:\nWar is an inauspicious instrument—\nused only when there is no other choice.\nWhen used, it slays and wounds men;\nwhen victorious, do not revel in it.\nThus it is said:\nIn the land of death, thorns and brambles grow—\nthere one weeps in sorrow,\nand there one dwells in mourning rites.\nHence the noble pursues virtue and righteousness,\nand does not rely on heavy arms.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is natural;\nartifice brings its loss.\nReputation is the guest of substance—\nno greater name than that of a ruler.\nIf a ruler has virtue, his name requires no seeking,\nfor the world bestows it upon him.\n\nTo receive it is to embrace it.\nThis is why the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings excelled,\nand why the Five Hegemons and Seven Heroes declined.\nTo abandon virtue and rely on arms\nis to stray far from the Way of Heaven.\n\nWénzǐ asked:\nWhy are benevolence and righteousness inferior to virtue and the Way?\n\nFor those who act with righteousness, they must clarify it through giving and taking.\nWithin the Four Seas, sorrow and joy cannot be universal—\nexhausting the treasuries’ wealth and goods is insufficient to provide for all the people.\nThus, it is known that wisdom is inferior to cultivating the Dao and practicing virtue,\nfollowing the natural disposition of Heaven and Earth,\nso that all things spontaneously align,\nand the world is abundantly nourished—\nbenevolence and righteousness then arise naturally.\n\nHence, the noble man dwells in substance, not in superficiality.\n\nRitual is the adornment of substance;\nbenevolence is the manifestation of kindness.\nThus, ritual conforms to human nature without exceeding its limits,\nand benevolence does not exceed kindness—\nsorrow and joy arise from genuine emotion,\nand honoring the dead aligns with benevolence.\n\nWénzǐ asked how benevolence, righteousness, and ritual are inferior to virtue and the Dao.\nLǎozǐ replied:\nFor the benevolent, sorrow and joy must be the measure;\nfor the righteous, giving and taking must be clarified.\n\nSorrow and joy, giving and taking—\nthese involve artificial action.\nAmong the people of the world, those worthy of sorrow are many,\nthose worthy of joy are few;\nthe wealth of the treasuries, when taken, is limited,\nwhen given, easily exhausted.\nVirtue and the Dao require no artificial action,\ntrusting in the spontaneous alignment of all things,\nand thus the world is abundantly nourished.\n\nNourishing life does not force what people cannot achieve,\nnor does it cut off what they cannot endure.\nModeration in measure ensures nothing is lost—\nthen praise and blame have no cause to arise.\n\nThus, music is sufficient to harmonize joy,\nwithout exceeding harmony,\nclarifying the distinction between life and death,\nand understanding the balance between extravagance and frugality.\n\nBut in the later ages, it is not so:\nwords and deeds contradict each other,\nemotions and appearances oppose each other,\nritual becomes burdensome with excess,\nmusic becomes chaotic with indulgence,\ncustoms grow corrupt in the world,\npraise and blame converge at court—\nthus, the sage is abandoned and not employed.\n\nRace a fine steed alongside a man—\nthe man cannot outpace the steed;\nplace the man upon a chariot—\nthe steed cannot outpace the man.\nThus, those skilled in the Dao\nuse what others possess to establish their achievements,\nrelying on their own abilities to compensate for others’ limitations.\n\nWhen the ruler gives in due time, the people repay with wealth;\nwhen the ruler meets them with ritual, the people repay with their lives.\nThere are nations in peril, but no secure rulers;\nthere are anxious sovereigns, but no joyful ministers.\nWhen virtue exceeds one’s station, it brings honor;\nwhen emolument exceeds one’s virtue, it brings misfortune.\nVirtue’s worth is boundless, righteousness’ demands are not excessive.\nTo hold high station without virtue is to usurp;\nto take without righteousness is to steal.\n\nThe sage finds contentment in poverty, takes joy in the Dao,\ndoes not harm life through desire,\ndoes not burden himself with gain,\nthus does not violate righteousness to take what is unjust.\n\nLife in the world has endured long—\nthose who receive their due thrive and multiply.\nThus, the worthy ruler does not force what people cannot achieve,\nnor does he cut off what they cannot endure,\nensuring all people receive their due sustenance.\n\nTherefore, to find contentment in poverty and joy in the Dao,\nto not harm life through desire,\nto not violate righteousness in taking what is just—\nwhat more desire could there be?\n\nIn ancient times, without virtue, one was not honored;\nwithout ability, one was not appointed.\n\nThe man without merit is not rewarded;\nthe man without crime is not punished.\nIn advancing men, he relies on **rites** (*lǐ* 禮);\nin dismissing them, he relies on **righteousness** (*yì* 義).\n\nIn the age of the petty man,\nadvancing men is like the earth’s sky—boundless;\ndismissing them is like the depths of a well—unfathomable.\nSpeaking of antiquity is but to lament the present.\n\nIn selecting horses, one errs by favoring the sour;\nin choosing men, one errs by favoring the poor.\nA fat pig fills the kitchen, but a lean one is not made an **official** (*guān* 官).\nThe **gentleman** (*jūnzǐ* 君子) discerns truth,\nand does not trust slanderous words.\n\nIf a **loyal subject** (*zhōngchén* 忠臣) fails to admonish his lord’s faults,\nhe is not truly loyal;\nif the lord does not heed admonishment,\nhe is not truly enlightened.\n\nIf the people sink into ruin and the ruler takes no concern,\nhe is not a **worthy ruler** (*xiánjūn* 賢君).\nThus, to uphold **principle** (*jié* 節) and die in hardship\nis the duty of a subject;\nto endure cold and hunger\nis the kindness of a filial father.\n\nTo use the **great** (*dà* 大) for the **small** (*xiǎo* 小) is called **perverting men** (*biànrén* 變人);\nto use the **small** for the **great** is called **defying Heaven** (*nìtiān* 逆天).\nThough one may rise to the heavens in the beginning,\nhe will surely fall into **calamity** (*kùn* 困) in the end.\n\nHence, in the village,\none respects the **elderly** (*lǎo* 老) by seniority,\nand does not abandon the **poor** (*qióng* 穷);\nin the court,\none ranks by **noble title** (*jué* 爵),\nand distinguishes **honor and lowliness** (*zūn bēi* 尊卑) with proper order.\n\nThe method of selecting officials must consider **virtue/power** (*déxíng* 德行), speech, governance, and scholarship—if one excels in any of these, he should be fit for office. If he lacks all four, then he is but a monkey adorned with a scholar’s cap.\n\nIn antiquity, those without **virtue/power** were not honored, those without ability were not appointed, those without merit were not ennobled, and those with guilt were not spared. Thus, offices were not mismatched with men, nor were men left unused.\n\nTo **cherish the noble** is to draw near the ruler;\nto **honor the elderly** is to draw near one’s kin;\nto **respect the elder** is to draw near one’s brother.\n\nThose born noble grow arrogant,\nthose born rich grow extravagant.\nThus, if the wealthy and noble do not reflect on the **Dao/Way** with clarity,\nfew will refrain from wrongdoing.\n\nTo study without surfeit is to cultivate oneself;\nto teach without weariness is to govern the people.\nWith **worthy teachers and fine friends**, few will abandon virtue.\n\nTo know the **worthy** is wisdom,\nto love the **worthy** is benevolence,\nto honor the **worthy** is righteousness,\nto revere the **worthy** is propriety,\nto delight in the **worthy** is joy.\n\nFather and son uphold **filial virtue** (*én* 恩),\nruler and subject uphold **righteous principle** (*yì* 义).\nTo grasp **virtue/power** and **righteous principle** is the foundation of loyalty and filial piety.\n\nTo **cherish the noble**, honor the elderly, and respect the elder—\nthis is to know the roots.\n\nIf one can know, love, honor, revere, and delight in the **worthy**,\nthen the **Dao/Way** of seeking, nurturing, and employing the **worthy** is attained.\n\nThe ancients who governed well did nothing yet accomplished all—\nthus their governance was all-encompassing.\nTo embrace this all-encompassing **virtue/power** (*róng* 容),\nto act without doing yet achieve results;\nto fail in this **virtue/power**,\nevery action brings calamity.\n\nTo govern with this **virtue/power** is like:\n**Cautious** as one crossing a river in winter—\n**Fearful** as one wary of neighbors—\n**Solemn** as a guest—\n**Dissolved** as melting ice—\n**Unadorned** as uncarved wood—\n**Mixed** as muddy water—\n**Vast** as a valley.\n\nThus:\n**Cautious** as one crossing a river in winter—\nhe does not dare to act rashly;\n**Fearful** as one wary of neighbors—\nhe fears self-harm;\n**Solemn** as a guest—\nhe is reverent and respectful;\n**Dissolved** as melting ice—\nhe does not dare to hoard;\n**Unadorned** as uncarved wood—\nhe does not dare to be polished;\n**Mixed** as muddy water—\nhe does not dare to be clear;\n**Vast** as a valley—\nhe does not dare to be full.\n\nHe who advances does not dare to act first,\nhe who retreats does not dare to lead—\nhe who fears self-harm guards **softness and weakness** without arrogance—\nhe who is reverent in respect humbles himself to honor others—\nhe who does not dare hoard diminishes himself without rigidity—\nhe who does not dare be polished lacks nothing yet is incomplete—\nhe who does not dare be clear endures filth without pride—\nhe who does not dare be full sees insufficiency without self-exaltation.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** retreats yet leads,\nguards **softness and weakness** yet stands firm,\nhumbles itself yet elevates others,\ndiminishes itself yet remains whole,\nendures filth yet remains pure,\nsees insufficiency yet suffices.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **worthy** is to do nothing yet accomplish all.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the **Great Virtue** (*Kǒngdé* 孔德) follows the **Dao/Way** alone.\n\nThe ancients who governed well did nothing yet accomplished all—\nthe vastness of the world, the multitude of people and things,\nall were contained within it.\nThus, the greatness of **non-action** (*wúwéi* 無為) is its function,\nand the people of the world thus revere it without burden.\n\n---\n*[End of Volume Ten of the* **Communicated Meanings of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing*** *]*\n\n---\n*[Volume Eleven of the* **Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*** *]*\n\n**Volume Eleven: *Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*\n*The Chapter on Supreme Virtue***\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who seek the **Dao/Way** must clearly discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasp the root of order and chaos, and clarify the mind to preserve it. To perceive its beginning and end, returning to the void and emptiness—this is called enlightenment.\n\nThe root of governance lies in **virtue/power** and righteousness; its branches are laws and institutions. That which sustains life is the root; that which does not is the branch. Root and branch are one body, yet their love is dual. To prioritize the root over the branch is the **worthy**; to prioritize the branch over the root is the petty.\n\nLaws arise to aid righteousness—yet if laws outweigh righteousness, it is like valuing one’s cap and shoes while neglecting one’s head and feet. **Virtue/power** and righteousness are vast and exalted. To extend their breadth without deepening their substance is ruin; to elevate height without broadening the foundation is collapse.\n\nThus, without great beams, one cannot bear great weight. To bear weight, nothing surpasses the **lignum vitae**; to govern a nation, nothing surpasses **virtue/power**.\n\nThe ruler’s relation to the people is like the foundation to a city, the roots to a tree. Deep roots mean a firm foundation; a thick base means stability above. Therefore, what lacks foundation in **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** cannot be called doctrine; what does not align with the ancient sages cannot be called the **Dao/Way**.\n\nTo merely select techniques for single acts or deeds is not the universal **Dao/Way**. The **worthy** discerns the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasps the root of order and chaos.\n\nGovernance has roots and branches; knowing what to prioritize brings one near to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**. Can such methods govern the world?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe **Dao/Way** of governing people is like **Zhaofu’s** driving of four horses. The reins and bit are aligned, the chest is straightened, the heart is internally harmonized, and the horses’ will is externally attuned. Thus, they follow the path, arrive far, with surplus **qi** and strength. Advance, retreat, turn, or curve—all as intended. Truly, he has mastered the technique.\n\nNow, power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; great ministers are the four horses. The body cannot abandon the chariot’s stability, nor can the hands lose the horses’ harmony. Thus, if the four horses are not attuned, **Zhaofu** cannot take the path; if ruler and ministers are not in accord, even the sage cannot govern.\n\nWield the **Dao/Way** to guide them, and mediocrity can be exhausted; clarify distinctions to instruct them, and deceit can be halted. Observe changes as things arise, respond to transformations as events unfold. The near will not be disordered, and the distant will be governed.\n\nWithout contrived teachings, yet attaining the natural **Dao/Way**, all actions will be without error. Heaven and Earth are one horse; all things, one finger. The sage’s penetration to the utmost is likened to chariots and horses for power and ministers, the ruler riding upon them without exertion, conquering all without resistance—this is the method of governance.\n\nHow can one who wields the reins speak otherwise?\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who practice the **Dao/Way** block the crooked paths, prevent darkness before it arises. They do not prize their own correctness but prize not doing wrong. Thus it is said:\n*\"Do not allow desire to arise; then there will be no daily seeking.\nDo not allow what can be taken to arise; then there will be no daily contention.\"*\n\nThus, private desires are released, and the public **Dao/Way** prevails. What is in excess is restrained by measure; what is applied is sufficient, and thus the world can be unified.\n\nIf one abandons duty to listen to praise and blame, discards merit to favor factions, then odd talents flee and hide, officials neglect their posts; the people’s customs decay in the state, and ministers contend in court. Thus, with the **Dao/Way**, one governs others; without it, one is governed by others.\n\nA skilled physician does not treat existing illness but prevents illness before it arises. Those who practice the **Dao/Way** block the crooked paths, govern what has not yet occurred—are they not like the skilled physician?\n\nThus, not prizing one’s own correctness but prizing not doing wrong means there will be no desire to seek what can be desired, no contention over what can be taken. Therefore, with the **Dao/Way**, one can govern others; without it, one is controlled by others.\n\nLaozi says:\nGovernance of the state has constants, yet benefiting the people is the root. **Political teachings** have a **Dao/Way**, yet proper conduct is paramount. If it benefits the people, it need not conform to antiquity; if it suffices for affairs, it need not follow custom.\n\nThus, the sage adapts laws to the times and rites to customs. Clothing and tools are made convenient for use; laws and decrees are adapted to necessity. Therefore, altering antiquity is not wrong, nor is following custom sufficient praise.\n\nReciting the books of the ancient kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as understanding their intent. To grasp their intent is beyond words.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken is not the constant **Dao/Way**; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nThe sage’s path is called the **Dao/Way**, like metal and stone—once tuned, it cannot be altered again; like the *qin* and *se*—when the melody ends, the tuning changes. Laws, institutions, rites, and music are the tools of governance, not the governance itself.\n\nThus, the narrow-minded cannot discuss the supreme **Dao/Way**, for they are bound by conventions and constrained by teachings.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the essence of law; law is the application of the **Dao/Way**. Governance of the state has constants, yet benefiting the people is the root—that is the **Dao/Way**. **Political teachings** have a **Dao/Way**, yet proper conduct is paramount—that is law.\n\nThe sage adapts laws to the times and rites to customs; laws and decrees are adapted to necessity. Thus, the narrow-minded cannot discuss the supreme **Dao/Way**, for they are bound by teachings.\n\nLaozi says:\nIs there truly a constant law in the world? What aligns with worldly affairs, accords with human nature, harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, and attends to spirits and gods—this can rectify governance.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns governed without laws, yet the people obeyed. The Five Emperors established laws but had no punishments. The Xia did not break their word; the Yin took oaths; the Zhou made alliances.\n\nIn the declining ages, they endured humiliation yet despised shame, coveted gain yet lacked disgrace.\n\nThe laws and decrees must be discussed in light of customs and adjusted to the urgency of the times. Tools and implements must be adapted to changing circumstances to suit their purpose.\n\nThose who adhere strictly to laws cannot be entrusted with distant undertakings; those bound by ritual cannot be expected to respond to change. Only those with singular insight and acute hearing can then claim to embody the **Dao/Way** and act accordingly.\n\nThose who understand the origins of law will adapt it to the times; those who do not grasp the source of governance, though they follow tradition, will only bring chaos.\n\nNowadays, scholars cling to ancient teachings, clutching texts and rigid doctrines, hoping to govern by them—like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. They will find it difficult to achieve what is fitting.\n\nTo preserve safety and restore order, even the wise are powerless; to uphold the **Dao/Way** by emulating antiquity, even the foolish have an advantage.\n\nThus, laws that are not applied, the sage does not enact; words untested, the enlightened ruler does not heed.\n\nThe sage establishes laws to prohibit deceit, redress wrongs, and protect the people. The Three Sovereigns ruled without decrees, yet the people obeyed. From the Five Emperors onward, the laws, rewards, and punishments of each dynasty differed—because the times changed.\n\nHow can an enlightened ruler fail to investigate this?\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: *\"Where do laws originate?\"*\n**Laozi** replied: *\"Laws arise from *yì* (proper conduct), and *yì* arises from satisfying the many. When the many are satisfied, this is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from Heaven nor emerge from Earth; they arise among people and return to self-regulation. If one attends to the root, disorder in the branches will not occur. Knowing the essentials, one is not confused by doubts; possessing them within oneself, one does not criticize others; lacking them within oneself, one does not blame those who uphold them. Those governed below must not neglect what is above; what is forbidden to the people must not be practiced by the ruler himself. Thus, the ruler’s laws serve as his own standard. If restraint begins with the ruler, then his commands will prevail among the people.\"*\n\nWhen **Wénzǐ** asked where laws originate, **Laozi** taught that laws arise from *yì*—what is fitting. The ancient kings established laws to suit the people’s sentiments, so they first set themselves as the standard: what they forbade among the people, they themselves dared not violate. Thus, their decrees were followed, and the world obeyed.\n\nLaws are the measure of the world, the standard of the ruler. To countenance lawlessness is to defy law itself. Once laws are established, those who conform are rewarded, and those who deviate are punished—even the noble are not lightly rewarded, and the lowly are not harshly punished. Those who break the law, though wise, must be punished; those who conform, though unworthy, are guiltless. Thus, public virtue flourishes while private desires are curbed.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people, preventing them from acting recklessly; rulers were established to control officials, preventing them from acting unilaterally; laws and **Dao/Way** were instituted to restrain rulers, preventing them from acting arbitrarily. When none may act recklessly, the **Dao/Way** prevails, and order is restored. Thus, it returns to *wuwei* (non-action)—not that it is inactive, but that its authority emanates from within.\n\nLaws are the ruler’s measure, the world’s standard. Once established, they must be applied without exception: those who break the law, even if noble, must be punished; those who conform, even if lowly, are guiltless. Thus, private desires are curbed, and public virtue prevails.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed, rulers established, and rites and laws instituted. When these three were not neglected, the world had no grievances, and society could return to simplicity—what need then for laws and decrees?\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"The skilled in rewards spend little yet inspire many;\nthe skilled in punishments minimize penalties yet deter vice;\nthe skilled in giving use sparingly yet cultivate virtue;\nthe skilled in taking amass much yet incur no resentment.*\n\nThus, the sage encourages the good by aligning with what the people favor and restrains vice by addressing what they abhor. Reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world fears to repeat. Hence, the greatest rewards cost nothing, and the severest punishments are never excessive. The sage governs with restraint yet achieves broad results—this is what is meant.\n\nTo give life, take life, and conceal—these are the **Dao/Way** of Heaven; to reward, punish, take, and give—these are the **Dao/Way** of humanity. The sage aligns above with Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and below with the people’s hearts, establishing the foundation for equitable governance.\n\nThose who hold the **Dao/Way** of the world must, in every matter, act with perfect virtue. Thus, reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world fears to repeat.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of the subject is to discern what is right, act first in matters, uphold duty, and clarify distinctions to achieve success. Thus, when ruler and subject differ in **Dao/Way**, order prevails; when they share the same **Dao/Way**, chaos ensues. Each must find their proper place, and all will have their due—then above and below can govern each other. Hence, branches must not surpass the trunk, nor extremities the root; speech and action must balance in weight and measure.*\n\nThose who wield authority hold little yet bear great responsibility, adhere to strict principles yet govern broadly. A tree ten *zhàng* in girth supports a thousand-*jūn* house—this is the power of structure; a five-*cùn* hinge controls the opening and closing—this is the power of position.\n\nOrders that must be obeyed bring benefit to those who comply and harm to those who resist—none dare disobey, for it is natural. When commands are issued and prohibitions enforced, it is through the collective force of the people.\n\n*Yì* (proper conduct) does not seek to benefit all under Heaven; benefiting one inspires the world to follow. Tyranny does not seek to harm all within the seas; harming one provokes universal rebellion. Thus, every action and decision must be carefully considered.\n\nThe ruler depends on the subject to stand, the subject depends on the ruler to act. The ruler must act with *wuwei* above, the subject must act below. To discern what is right, uphold duty, and clarify distinctions—this is the subject’s role.\n\nWhen ruler and subject each find their proper place, then above and below can govern each other, and great and small can restrain each other.\"*\n\n「Thus, differing from the Dao/Way is the path to governance—every action and decision holds weight in determining order or chaos, and the ruler cannot be too cautious in his deliberations.\n\nLaozi said: *\"To bend by an inch and extend by a foot, to yield in small ways and stand upright in great ones—this is the way of the sage.\"* Yet, when rulers judge their subjects, they fail to weigh their grand achievements, overlook their broad impact, and instead demand minor virtues, thereby losing the path to recognizing true merit.\n\nHence, one with profound *德* (virtue/power) should not be faulted for trifling matters; one with great renown should not be tarnished by petty flaws. For all human nature has its shortcomings, yet what matters is their grand vision—even if they have minor faults, these do not undermine their worth. If their grand vision is lacking, then their conduct in common affairs is unremarkable.\n\nThus, those overly strict in small matters achieve no great success, and those who censure others’ conduct are shunned by the masses. Those who grasp the greater whole have looser small constraints; those with vast ambition earn distant praise. This is the way of judging subjects.\n\nTrue full talents are rare in the world—this has always been so. The master carpenter seeks beams and pillars, not clinging to minor flaws, thus securing great materials. If a sovereign judges his ministers and advisors with the understanding of *\"bending by an inch to extend by a foot,\"* then great sages can be found.\n\nIndeed, no one is flawless in all things, nor are all deeds perfect. Abandoning the small to take the great—what grand endeavor cannot be accomplished? Overlooking the short to follow the long—what matter cannot succeed?\n\nLaozi said: *\"From ancient times to today, none have been able to perfect their conduct.\"*\n\nThus, the noble does not blame others for their failings. The square does not cut itself, the sharp does not slice itself, the straight does not overstep, the broad does not belittle—when it comes to *道* (Dao/Way), *德* (virtue/power), and martial prowess, the noble does not blame others.\n\nCultivating oneself through the Dao/Way and not blaming others is effortless. Cultivating oneself through the Dao/Way means one will have no regrets.\n\nThe *huang* (jade) of the Xia sovereign could not be without blemishes; the pearls of the bright moon could not be without impurities. Yet the world treasures them, not allowing minor flaws to overshadow their great beauty.\n\nNow, if one focuses on others’ shortcomings and forgets their strengths, yet still seeks to find merit in the world—this is indeed difficult. The common view holds that those of low station and humble birth, when faced with great dishonor, do not comprehend their grand vision.\n\nThus, the way of judging others is: observe their actions when in prosperity, their generosity when in wealth, their integrity when in poverty, and their restraint when in lowly status. See how they endure hardship to know their courage; observe their response to joy to gauge their resolve; test them with riches to measure their benevolence; frighten them to test their virtue. So, one may discern their true nature.\n\nThose who excuse themselves do not reform their faults; those who blame others cannot maintain true friendship. The noble does not blame others, knowing that not all are Yao or Shun, and thus cannot excel in every matter. If one has great talent, how can they be discarded for minor flaws?\n\nLaozi said: *\"To bend is to seek extension; to be crooked is to seek straightness. Bending by an inch to extend by a foot, yielding in small ways to stand upright in great ones—this is the way of the noble.\"*\n\nThough all streams flow together, those that do not empty into the sea are not valleys. Though all paths diverge, those that do not return to virtue are not the way of the noble. Good words are valued for their practicality; good deeds are valued for their benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe noble’s faults are like the eclipses of the sun and moon—they do not diminish their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act rashly, the brave do not kill recklessly. They choose what is fitting and act according to propriety, so that their deeds are accomplished and their achievements can be relied upon, and though they die, their names endure.\n\nEven if one has wisdom and ability, they must root themselves in benevolence and righteousness to stand firm. When wisdom and ability are both cultivated, the sage uses benevolence and righteousness as the central measure—those who conform are called noble, those who do not are called petty.\n\nThough the noble may die, their name does not perish; though the petty may gain power, their crimes are not absolved. To hold the map of all under Heaven in one hand while slaying oneself with the other—even the foolish would not do this, for life is more precious than all the world.\n\nTo face death for one’s sovereign and kin, one regards death as returning home—righteousness is heavier than life itself.\n\nThus, the greatest good of the world, when compared to life, is small; but life’s greatest weight, when compared to righteousness, is light. This is the measure of one who uses benevolence and righteousness as his standard.\n\nThe way of bending and extending is like the dragon and serpent in hibernation and arousal—nobles yield in small ways to stand upright in great ones, just as the dragon and serpent gather their *qi* before surging forward. Good words and good deeds nourish all living things, all arising from bending oneself to cultivate virtue.\n\nThe sage uses benevolence and righteousness as his standard, knowing that life is heavier than all the world, and righteousness is heavier than life itself. Thus, they can face death for their sovereign and kin.\n\nTherefore, though the noble may die, their name does not vanish.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The ranks of Dao/Way and virtue/power are like the sun and moon—even the barbarians cannot alter their course.\"* If one’s inclinations and actions are balanced, then their reputation is not bound by common opinion; if their intentions and conduct are harmonized, then their rise or fall depends on the times.\n\nIf their deeds are complete in the world, then their achievements are fulfilled; if their efforts align with the times, then their names endure. Thus, those who establish achievements and renown are simple in the world yet meticulous in the times—when the time arrives, there is no pause for breath.\n\nThe ancient warriors did not fight for land or riches, but to preserve life and restore order, to remove harm from the people. Those greedy for wealth and power, who covet many desires, bring ruin to the world, causing the masses to be restless and never at peace.\n\nWhen a sage arises, they punish the strong and violent, restore order to chaos, and remove harm from the world—turning turbidity into clarity, danger into security. Thus, they must inevitably rise and act.\n\nThe ranks of Dao/Way and virtue/power in humanity are like the sun and moon in the heavens; the five human inclinations are like the five stars. Even barbarians cannot alter their course.\n\nWhether one follows or abandons is in their own hands, not determined by others’ opinions. Whether they are used or not depends on the times; whether they succeed or fail hinges on their fate. Thus, the noble acts in the Dao/Way when the time is right, without pause for breath.\n\nThe Vermilion Sovereign caused the fire calamity, so the Yellow Sovereign subdued him.»\n\n共工 unleashed the water calamity, so Zhuanxu executed him.\n\nHe taught them with the Dao/Way, guided them with virtue/power, yet they refused to listen—then he confronted them with might and force. If they still did not comply, he subdued them with arms.\n\nTo slaughter the innocent and nourish the unrighteous—no greater harm exists. To exhaust the wealth of the realm for the desires of one—no deeper calamity exists. To indulge one’s own desires while prolonging the afflictions of the land—this is what the natural order rejects.\n\nThe reason kings are established is to suppress violence and chaos. Yet now, they exploit the strength of the people, only to become tyrants and bandits. How then can they not be removed? Just as one who raises fish must eliminate the otters, and one who tends beasts must eradicate the wolves—how much more so when shepherding the people?\n\nThus, the origin of arms and warfare.\n\nThe five phases of the state’s transformations have endured for ages. In the Fire Phase of the Vermilion Sovereign, the ruler lost his virtue/power, and fire became a calamity. In the Water Phase of共工, the ruler lost his virtue/power, and water became a calamity. Thus, it is known: when a ruler loses virtue/power, the corresponding phase brings disaster—this is the origin of arms and warfare.\n\nAll who govern lands—can they lose virtue/power and bring calamity upon themselves, yet remain unaware of warning?\n\nLaozi said: *\"The Way of governing a state is this: the sovereign issues no harsh decrees, officials impose no burdensome regulations, scholars engage in no deceitful conduct, and artisans practice no excessive craftsmanship. Their tasks are fulfilled without disturbance, their tools are complete without ornamentation.*\n\n*Yet in chaotic times, it is otherwise: those who act seek to outdo one another in extravagance; those who uphold ritual vie in false pretension. Chariots are over-elaborated with carvings, utensils are excessively adorned with engravings. Those who seek wealth compete to hoard rare treasures as precious; those who criticize culture pursue frivolous complications as urgent. Scholars engage in false argumentation, delaying decisions endlessly without aiding governance but fostering disorder. Artisans craft bizarre devices, taking years to complete, yet they serve no practical purpose.*\n\n*The Way of Shennong decreed: If men of prime vigor do not till the fields, there will be those who starve in the land. If women of childbearing years do not weave, there will be those who freeze. Thus, the sage himself plowed and his wife wove, setting an example for the people. He guided them, not valuing rare goods nor prizing useless objects. Therefore, the tillers did not toil excessively, yet had enough to sustain life; the weavers did not labor beyond measure, yet had enough to clothe their bodies. Neither surplus nor deficiency existed—each took only what they needed. With abundant food and clothing, deceit did not arise; with peace and ease, the realm was harmonious. The wise had no schemes to employ, the brave no valor to display. The methods of ancient and modern governance differ because customs change.*\n\n*In ancient times, people were pure and simple: the sovereign issued no harsh decrees, officials imposed no burdensome regulations, scholars engaged in no deceitful conduct, and artisans practiced no excessive craftsmanship. Thus, the people’s hearts were easily satisfied, and governance was not difficult. In later ages, customs shifted and winds changed; the sovereign’s excesses were emulated below, luxury became the norm, and greed knew no bound. Hence, the people’s hearts were hard to satisfy, and governance became arduous.\"*\n\nLaozi said: *\"The Way of the hegemonic king is this: he plans with strategy, he schemes with tactics. He acts with righteousness, not for mere survival, but to secure or destroy. Thus, when he hears of a neighboring ruler oppressing his people, he raises his army to their borders, accusing them of unrighteousness and reproaching their misdeeds. Upon arrival, he commands his generals: ‘Do not cut down trees, do not dig up graves, do not destroy crops, do not burn stores, do not capture civilians, do not seize livestock.’ Then he proclaims: ‘Their ruler defies heaven and earth, insults the spirits, judges unjustly, and slaughters the innocent. Heaven condemns him, and the people seek vengeance. Our army comes to abolish unrighteousness and bestow virtue/power upon them. Any who resist the heavenly order and harm the people shall be exterminated—root and branch. Those who surrender their households shall be rewarded with their households; those who surrender their neighborhoods shall be rewarded with their neighborhoods; those who surrender their districts shall be ennobled as lords of their districts. We conquer the state, but spare its people. We depose the tyrant, reform his governance, honor the virtuous, exalt the worthy, aid the orphaned and widowed, relieve the poor, release the imprisoned, and reward the meritorious.’ The people open their doors to welcome them, offering grain and provisions, fearing only that they may not arrive. A righteous army reaches the border and halts without battle. An unrighteous army arrives amid piles of corpses and flowing blood, clashing until all is lost.*\n\n*He who fights for the land cannot achieve kingship; he who fights for himself cannot establish his merit. He who acts for others gains their support; he who acts for himself loses them. Where the multitude aids, even the weak become strong; where the multitude abandons, even the mighty perish.\"*\n\nThe *Wenzi* comprises twelve chapters, of which three are primary and four secondary. It encompasses both the ancient sages and the hegemons—within it lie the emperors and kings. The age of hegemony was perhaps the autumn of the times? Observing its language—*\"not for mere survival, but to secure or destroy\"*—one sees the spirit of revival and restoration vividly, far removed from the unrighteous deeds of later ages.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The superior ruler governs the state, orders the realm, practices benevolence and righteousness, dispenses virtue/power and favors, establishes just laws, and blocks deceitful paths. His ministers and officials are loyal, the people are harmonious, and all hearts are united in purpose. The feudal lords submit to his authority, and the four quarters revere his virtue/power. He refines governance within the ancestral temple, and repels invasions a thousand li away. His decrees issued, the realm responds in unison—this is the highest attainment.*\n\n*In the next rank: vast lands, numerous people, a wise sovereign, capable generals, abundant wealth, strong arms, reliable discipline, clear orders. When facing equal foes, before a single blade is drawn, the enemy flees in rout—this is the secondary attainment.*\n\n*He knows the suitability of the land, masters the advantages of terrain, understands the shifts of oppressive governance, and discerns the tactics of battle.\"*\n\nTo wield the blade in close combat, to face arrows and stones like rain, to carry the slain and tend the wounded—this is the lowest application of virtue/Way.\n\nThe triumph or defeat of armies lies in governance. When governance overcomes the people, the ministers submit and the soldiers grow strong. When the people overcome governance, the ministers rebel and the soldiers grow weak. When virtue/Way is sufficient to embrace the people of the realm, when undertakings are adequate to meet the realm’s crises, when appointments and promotions win the hearts of worthy scholars, and when counsel and deliberation resolve matters of weight—this is the highest virtue/Way of the military.\n\nThe *Art of War* states that the first to act is the host, the one who responds is the guest. There is a saying about warfare: *\"I dare not be the host and instead be the guest,\"*—meaning one must not act rashly in battle.\n\nWhen use of arms is unavoidable, then just cause is supreme; the enemy’s flight is secondary, and combat itself is the lowest recourse. Laozi said: *\"The reason a state grows strong is that its people are willing to die.\"* The reason they are willing to die is that their cause is just. The just cause succeeds because of its righteous might. Thus, to govern with *civil* means and align with *martial* force is called the way of inevitable victory; when righteous might and just cause are united, this is called strength.\n\nIn battle, when blades clash and arrows and stones fall like rain, and officers vie to lead—it is because rewards are trustworthy and punishments are clear. If a ruler regards his subjects as sons, they will serve him as fathers. If a ruler regards his subjects as brothers, they will follow him as elder siblings. If he views them as sons, he will reign over the four seas. If he views them as fathers, he will rectify the world.\n\nIf a ruler regards his subjects as brothers, he will not hesitate to die for them. If subjects serve their ruler as elder siblings, they will not hesitate to perish for him. Hence, when the bonds are those of father and son or brother and brother, such conflicts cannot be fought.\n\nTherefore, a just ruler refines governance within and accumulates virtue/power within the ancestral temple, while repelling evil without to demonstrate his might. He observes their labor and rest to know their hunger and fullness. When battle is certain, he treats death as returning home—such is the depth of his benevolence.\n\nThere is a Way to govern the realm—why resort to arms at all? Only when there is no alternative. The soldiers of a strong state die because they are compelled by just cause. Then, would a ruler of the Way tolerate a strong state that places its people in the path of death?\n\nIf a ruler regards his subjects as sons, and they serve him as fathers, then a just ruler who refines governance and accumulates virtue/power will see his state grow strong naturally—such examples exist in the world.\n\n*(End of Chapter Eleven of the *True Classic of the Mysterious Dao*, compiled by the Southern Valley Master Du Daojian.)*\n\n---\n**Chapter Twelve: The Way of the Realm** *(Compiled by the Southern Valley Master Du Daojian.)*\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Way of the Realm**\n*(The True Classic of the Mysterious Dao, compiled by the Southern Valley Master Du Daojian)*\n\n---\n\n**Section on Supreme Rites**\n\nLaozi said:\nIn the age of the ancient True Ones, they harmonized the breath of yin and yang, and all living beings looked up to their virtue/power in harmony. At that time, all things spontaneously aligned, their essence remained hidden and pure, and the world thrived in great ease.\n\nWhen the age declined to the time of Fu Xi, men grew dim and laborious, all seeking to abandon their childlike innocence and awaken to the world. Between heaven and earth, virtue became fragmented and inconsistent. When Shennong and the Yellow Emperor took leadership over the world, they established the framework of the four seasons, harmonized yin and yang, and thus all people stood in awe, straining their senses to listen and obey. Yet governance remained unbalanced.\n\nBy the time of the Xia and Shang dynasties, desires grew excessive, and wisdom was seduced by external things, so that nature and life lost their true essence. When this spread to the Zhou, refinement scattered simplicity, and they abandoned the Dao for artifice, perverting virtue into conduct. Cleverness and cunning emerged, and men mimicked the sages with deceitful learning, flaunting empty rhetoric to coerce the masses, polishing poetry and books to trade for fame. Each sought to impose their own intelligence, masking themselves in falsehoods to fit the world, thus losing the root of the great tradition.\n\nThus, the world has long suffered the decay of nature and life.\n\nTherefore, the study of the True Ones seeks to restore nature through stillness, to wander the heart in emptiness. The study of the common world, however, flaunts virtue/power and exhausts nature, agitating the five viscera, recklessly acting beyond wisdom, and clamoring for fame in the world—these are the things the True Ones do not do. To exhaust nature is to sever life.\n\nThe True Ones are fixed in the intent of life and death, penetrating the logic of honor and shame. If the world praises them, they are not further encouraged; if the world condemns them, they are not further discouraged. This is the essence of attaining the Dao.\n\nIs the \"supreme rite\" the five rites—auspicious, mourning, military, guest, and festive?\n\nThe ancient True Ones were the sovereigns of the primal age. At that time, all living beings were pure and simple, and the world thrived in great ease. From Fu Xi to Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, and extending to the Three Sovereigns, governance varied, and rites adapted accordingly, reaching their peak in the Warring States era. But the root was already lost.\n\nLaozi said:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings wore loose hair without collars and ruled the world. Their virtue/power gave life without taking it, gave without seizing, and the world did not reject their ways. All shared in their virtue/power. At that time, yin and yang were in harmony, and all things flourished. Birds’ nests could be reached by bending down, and wild beasts could be tethered and led.\n\nBut as the age declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became men’s adversaries. Thus, iron was cast and blades forged to repel these dangers. When people faced hardship, they sought convenience; when they encountered calamity, they devised defenses. Each used their intelligence to avoid harm and pursue benefit. Customs were not fixed, and tools were not permanent. Thus, the laws of the ancient kings were subject to change.\n\nTherefore, it is said: *\"The named is the named, but not the unchanging name.\"* The Five Emperors followed different Ways, yet their virtue/power covered the world. The Three Kings pursued distinct affairs, yet their names endured in posterity. This was adapting to the times.\n\nIt is like the blind musician Zhi Kuang tuning the five tones—his adjustments had no fixed measure, yet none were out of harmony. Thus, those attuned to the essence of music could compose melodies. Those who grasped the fundamental principles of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords could govern men.\n\nTherefore, the ancient kings’ institutions, if no longer fitting, were abandoned; the customs of later ages, if beneficial, were adopted. Thus, the sages who established rites and music were not bound by rites and music, those who governed things were not bound by things, and those who made laws were not bound by laws. Hence it is said: *\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\"*\n\nThe Way of Heaven has no constancy, and the world grows ever more degenerate. In ancient times, the sovereigns wore loose hair without collars, and the world did not reject their attire. The people and creatures flourished, all sharing in their virtue/power. But as the age declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became men’s adversaries. Laws and tools adapted to the times, and thus warfare arose.\n\nLaozi said:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings looked upward to the patterns of Heaven, downward to the measures of Earth, and inward to the laws of humanity. They regulated the qi of yin and yang, harmonized the rhythms of the four seasons, and observed the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and fertile or barren lands to establish affairs and generate wealth, removing the sufferings of hunger and cold, averting the calamities of sickness and misfortune.\n\nWithin, they received the affairs of humanity to establish rites and music, practicing the Way of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relationships. They arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to establish filial piety and form the family. They listened to the pure and impure tones of the five notes and the generative sequences of the six pitches to establish the obligations of ruler and subject and form the state. They observed the order of early, middle, and late in the four seasons to establish the hierarchy of elders and juniors and form the bureaucracy. They divided the lands into regions and assigned duties to govern them. They established the Grand Academy to teach—these were the fundamental principles of governance.\n\nWhen the Way is attained, it is upheld; when the Way is lost, it is abandoned. Nothing in the world remains stretched without relaxation, completed without ruin—only the sage can achieve completion without decay.\n\nIs the principle of Heaven’s unity the same as the principle of a man’s life? To know the beginning of life is to know the origin of all things, for the time before life is the time before all things.\n\nWhen a man is young and then grows strong, it is like the convergence and movement of the primal unity. When he grows old, it is like the passage of an age. To know that youth transforms into strength, strength into old age, and old age into death is to understand what comes after the origin of all things.\n\nAs for those who transform without being transformed—are they not the sages alone?\n\nWhen the sages first composed music, it was to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness, restoring the heart to its natural state. But as it declined, it became excessive and unreturning, indulging in sensuality without regard for proper law, spreading to later ages until it led to the fall of kingdoms.\n\nAs for their writings, they were meant to guide all affairs—so that the foolish would not forget, and the wise would record events.\n\nWhen it declined, they resorted to deceit and falsehood to exonerate the guilty and condemn the innocent, putting the innocent to death.\n\nAs for their parks and preserves, they were originally established to provide for the offerings of ancestral temples and to mobilize soldiers for unexpected emergencies. But when they declined, they indulged in reckless hunting and hawking, seizing the people’s time and exhausting their strength.\n\nAs for their promotion of the worthy, it was meant to harmonize teaching and governance, to adjudicate lawsuits fairly, to place the worthy in office, and to assign the capable to their duties. Benevolence spread below, and the common people cherished virtue. But when it declined, factions and cliques formed, each advancing their own allies, abandoning the public for private gain, and elevating outsiders and insiders alike. The wicked took office, while the worthy withdrew in obscurity.\n\nThe writings of **Wénzǐ** serve as a mirror for ten thousand generations.\n\nThe original intent of the sages in establishing these institutions was:\nMusic, to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness;\nWritings, to guide all affairs;\nParks and preserves, to provide for ancestral temple offerings;\nPromotion of the worthy, to harmonize teaching and governance, and to adjudicate lawsuits fairly.\n\nBut when they declined:\nMusic became an indulgence in sensuality,\nWritings became deceitful,\nParks and preserves became grounds for hunting,\nPromotion of the worthy became factionalism,\nAnd the wicked took office while the worthy hid away—this was inevitable.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven and Earth is such that extremes reverse, and excess leads to loss.\nThus, the sages addressed decay by reforming institutions, and when one method reached its end, they introduced another. Their excellence lay in harmony, their failure in expedience.\n\nThe **Dao** of the sages states:\nWithout cultivating ritual and righteousness, propriety and shame cannot stand. If the people lack propriety and shame, they cannot be governed. Without knowing ritual and righteousness, laws cannot be properly enforced. Without upholding the good and abandoning the base, people will not turn toward ritual and righteousness. Without laws, governance is impossible. Without knowing ritual and righteousness, laws cannot be implemented.\n\nLaws may kill the unfilial, but they cannot make people filial. They may punish thieves, but they cannot make people virtuous.\n\nWhen the sage-kings ruled above, they made their preferences and disapprovals clear to the people, using praise and blame to guide them. They honored the worthy and advanced them, while they degraded the unworthy and removed them. They enforced punishments but did not rely on them; they cultivated ritual and righteousness and entrusted governance to the virtuous.\n\nThus, the highest in the land were the **Three Dukes**, the highest in a state were the **Nine Ministers**, the highest in a country were the **Twenty-Seven Great Officers**, and the highest in a village were the **Eighty-One Elemental Worthies**.\n\nThe vastness of Heaven and Earth cannot stand without humanity. The exalted status of the emperor cannot be sustained without the people. The multitude of the four quarters cannot be governed without ritual, righteousness, and shame.\n\nTherefore, the sages reformed decayed institutions and established new ones, using ritual, righteousness, and shame as the four cardinal supports. When the worthy were in their posts, ritual and righteousness flourished, and punishments were rarely used.\n\nTo surpass ten thousand people in wisdom was called **Yīng** (英),\nTo surpass a thousand was called **Zhì** (智),\nTo surpass a hundred was called **Jié** (杰),\nTo surpass ten was called **Háo** (豪).\n\nOne who understood the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth, and grasped the principles of human nature,\nWhose breadth could embrace the multitude, whose benevolence could win the distant,\nWhose wisdom could discern expedience—such a person was **Yīng** (英);\n\nOne whose virtue could teach and transform, whose conduct could uphold righteousness,\nWhose trustworthiness could win the people, whose clarity could illuminate below—such a person was **Zhì** (智);\n\nOne whose conduct could serve as a model, whose wisdom could resolve doubts,\nWhose trustworthiness could keep agreements, whose integrity could govern the distribution of wealth,\nWhose actions were lawful, whose words were proper—such a person was **Jié** (杰);\n\nOne who fulfilled their duties without neglect, who adhered to righteousness without forming factions,\nWho did not evade difficulties and did not seek unjust gain—such a person was **Háo** (豪).\n\nThe **Yīng, Zhì, Jié,** and **Háo** were placed in their respective positions according to their talents—from root to branch, from heavy to light—with the ruler leading and the people responding in harmony. Within the four seas, all hearts turned in unison, abandoning greed and vulgarity, turning toward benevolence and righteousness. In transforming the people, their influence was like the wind sweeping through the grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy rule over the worthy, even severe punishments cannot restrain their deceit.\n\nThe small cannot control the great, the weak cannot command the strong—this is the nature of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the sages selected the worthy to establish merit, while unworthy rulers elevated their like-minded allies. By observing whom they promote, one can discern whether a state is orderly or chaotic. By examining their factions, one can judge whether they are worthy or unworthy.\n\nIn ancient times, the method of selecting officials ranked **moral cultivation and virtue** highest, followed by **benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music**, then **writing, arithmetic, and laws**. Only then did they consider **wisdom**. Was this not the method of the **Warring States**?\n\nThe principles of governance are such that the small cannot control the great, and the weak cannot control the strong. If one relies on **balancing scales and sealed debates**, even severe punishments cannot restrain deceit.\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\nThose who establish ritual carve and polish human nature, forcing and restraining its spontaneity. Though the eyes desire something, ritual restrains its measure. Though the heart takes pleasure, ritual restricts it with propriety. Moving, circling, bowing, and scraping—limbs stiffen though they do not eat, wine settles though they do not drink. Externally, the body is bound; internally, the mind is troubled. The harmony of yin and yang is suppressed, and the essence of life is strained. Thus, one spends their life as a sorrowful being.\n\nWhy? Because they do not address the root of desire but only restrain its expression. They do not explore the source of joy but only prevent its indulgence. This is like caging a wild beast without blocking its path, or damning a river’s flow with one’s hands. Therefore, it is said:\n*\"Open the mouth of the flood, complete the task—yet the life will never be saved.\"*\n\nRitual does not eliminate desire but restrains it.\nMusic does not eliminate joy but regulates it.\n\nRitual is the standard for self-discipline and the tool to prevent vice—it is the universal path of the world.\n\nAs **Yánzǐ**’s gaze, hearing, speech, and movement adhered to ritual, keeping his heart in harmony with it, then the improper could not enter.\n\nThe proper use of ritual values **harmony** above all.\nWhen a gentleman’s heart is full, ritual is sincere within and expressed without, naturally harmonizing with Heaven and Earth. Human relationships become harmonious, yin and yang are balanced, and all things flourish.\n\nThe ruler who makes all under Heaven fear punishment so that none dare steal—\nhow much better it would be to eliminate the very desire to steal!\n\nThus, when the use of something is known, even the greedy will decline it;\nwhen its uselessness is unknown, even the virtuous cannot relinquish it.\n\nThe reason states perish, rulers die by others’ hands, and they become the laughingstock of the world—\nit is never because of anything other than desire.\n\nIf one knows that a fan in winter and a fur in summer serve no purpose,\nthen all things would be reduced to dust and filth.\n\nThus, to stop boiling by skimming the foam only makes it worse—\none must remove the fire at its source.\n\nThe difficulty of governing theft has long persisted.\nSteal a hook and you are executed; steal a kingdom and you become a feudal lord.\nThus, theft lies with the ruler, not the commoner.\n\nIf, like Yao, one’s thatched hut is left untrimmed and unhewn timber uncarved,\neven rewards would not tempt theft.\n\nTo topple palaces of jade and gold, to ruin the halls of the tyrants—\nthe fate of Jie and Zhou—\ntheir bodies torn apart by others, alas!\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"To act in accordance with one’s nature is called the Dao;\nto attain one’s innate nature is called virtue.*\n\nWhen nature is lost, then benevolence is prized;\nwhen the Dao is lost, then righteousness is prized.\nOnce benevolence and righteousness are established, virtue and the Dao decay.\nWhen purity and simplicity scatter, ritual and music become ornate;\nwhen distinctions of right and wrong take form, the people are bewildered;\nwhen jade and pearls are treasured, the world falls into contention.\n\nRitual serves to distinguish the noble from the base, the high from the low;\nrighteousness harmonizes the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son,\nbrothers, husband and wife—the proper order of human affairs.\n\nIn the decadent age, ritual becomes mere formality, and acts of courtesy are called ‘righteousness’\nfor the sake of gain, while lords and ministers denounce one another,\nand kin harbor grudges.\n\nThus, stagnant water breeds cannibalistic creatures,\ndecaying earth spawns self-devouring beasts—\nornate ritual and music give rise to deceit and falsehood.\n\nNo thing, in its use, endures without eventually decaying.\nThough the Dao may be followed and virtue attained,\nif the time is not right, it cannot be practiced.\n\nEven when lords and ministers uphold righteousness,\nthey cannot escape mutual reproach;\nwhen parents and children rely on affection,\nthey may still breed resentment.\n\nIs this not the fixed nature of human hearts?\n\nIn the decadent age, governance does not accumulate the means of sustenance,\nbut instead corrupts the purity of the people, scatters their simplicity,\nconfuses the masses, and inverts clarity for filth.\nLife and essence scatter in chaos, all for the sake of greed.\nSincerity and trust decay into arrogance and negligence,\nand people lose their true nature.\nLaw and righteousness diverge, conduct and self-interest oppose one another,\nwhile the rich and poor scheme against each other—\neven the ruler and his servants are beyond comparison.\n\nWhen one has excess, one should yield;\nwhen one lacks, one contends.\nYielding gives rise to ritual and righteousness;\ncontention spawns violence and disorder.\nThus, excessive desire leads to unchecked actions,\nand insatiable greed fuels endless strife.\n\nTherefore, in an age of order, the petty man adheres to propriety\nand cannot be enticed by profit;\nin an age of chaos, the noble resorts to deceit\nand cannot be restrained by law.\n\nFood is essential to life—\none day without it brings hunger,\nthree days brings sickness,\nseven days brings death.\n\nIn ancient times, states stored ten years’ worth of grain,\nand thus could endure nine years of flood and seven years of drought\nwithout the people starving.\n\nBut in the decadent age, governance does not accumulate the means of sustenance—\nfor rulers, consumed by desire, cannot curb their actions.\nWhen the ruler lacks provision, he must take from below;\nwhen the people lack sustenance, they must contend for survival.\nHow grave is this hunger!\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"In a declining age, the ruler drills through mountains for ore,\nplucks gold and jade like fruit,\nharvests pearls and shells,\nmelts copper and iron—\nyet all things wither and fail to flourish.\n\nHe flays the pregnant, burns the sacrificial grounds,\ndestroys nests and ruins states—\nthe phoenix will not alight, the qilin will not roam.\nHe builds wooden towers, burns forests for hunting,\ndrains ponds for fishing, piles earth to make mounds,\ndug wells to drink from, dredges rivers to make pools,\nfortifies cities as strongholds, imprisons beasts for sport—\nand thus yin and yang are disrupted, the four seasons fall out of order.\nThunder and lightning are shattered, hail and frost bring ruin,\nten thousand things wither and die prematurely.\nHalf the crops fail, grasses and trees wither in summer,\nthe three great rivers run dry and cease to flow.\n\nHe demarcates mountains and rivers, setting boundaries,\ncounts the people, assigning quotas,\ndevises traps and ambushes as defenses,\nregulates clothing and colors, ranks the noble and base,\ndistinguishes the worthy from the unworthy,\nand enforces rewards and punishments—\nand thus war arises, and resentment spreads.\nThe innocent are slaughtered, the guilty go unpunished—\nthis is how calamity begins.\n\nThose who are full yet know not to stop\nare condemned by Heaven, Earth, and the spirits.\n\nWhen yin and yang are disrupted, the four seasons fall out of order,\nthunder and lightning are shattered, hail and frost bring ruin,\nten thousand things wither and die prematurely,\nand the rivers run dry—\nthese are the consequences of excess, the transformation of excess,\nand the harm of excess.\n\nIf one cannot correct these errors,\nthen human misfortune from excess follows.\n\nThis is indeed something to fear.\n\nLaozi said:\n*'When the world is about to lose its nature and essence,\nit is like the rise of yin energy—\nthe ruler is dim-witted and unclear,\nthe Dao is abandoned and not practiced,\nvirtue is extinguished and not upheld.\nActions defy Heaven, decrees contradict the seasons.\nSpring and autumn shrink from harmony,\nHeaven and Earth withdraw their blessings,\nthe ruler sits uneasily in his position,\nthe ministers withdraw in seclusion and remain silent,\nthe officials follow the ruler’s whims and abandon tradition,\nthey alienate their kin while flattering themselves,\nflatterers scheme in secret, mimicking the ruler’s chaos,\nand the people complete their ruin.\nThus, the ruler and minister grow estranged and untrusting,\nkin become distant and unfaithful,\nfields yield no grain, roads are deserted,\ntreasures lose their luster, jade becomes worthless,\ntortoiseshells have no inner markings, divination fails daily,\nand though the world is one in name, it is not truly united.\n\nThe feudal lords enact laws that differ in every state,\ncustoms become perverse,\nroots are uprooted, foundations abandoned,\nthe Five Punishments are sharpened into cruelty,\nthey quarrel over trifles while slaughtering half the people,\nraise armies for war, assault cities, and massacre indiscriminately,\noverturning the high to secure the low, deploying massive chariots,\nbuilding towering ramparts, clearing battlefields,\nforcing soldiers into death traps,\nclashing with stern enemies time and again—\ntheir fame may swell, their conquests vast,\nbut the dead pile up by the tens of thousands,\nand the old and weak perish in hunger and cold beyond count.'\"\n\nFrom this point onward, the world has never once known peace in life and death,\nnor has it found joy in its customs.\n\nThe Yang gives birth while the Yin kills—\nthe two *qi* shift in turn.\nThe rise and fall of states are indeed fated.\n\nYet when the six *qi* cycles complete and one Yin begins anew,\nthe *flood* of *Gonggong* serves as a warning,\nand for nine years, calamity ensues.\nUnless a sage like *Emperor Yao*, *Emperor Shun*, or *Emperor Yu* arises,\nthe lineage of such rulers will be extinguished.\n\nThus, rise and fall are fated,\norder and chaos depend on human action.\n\nWhen worthy sages emerge and uphold *the Dao/Way of virtue/power*,\nreinforced by the Seven *Rites of Virtue*,\nthey advance the near with wisdom,\nwin the distant with their virtue,\nuniting the world into one,\nwith descendants succeeding in governance,\nrejecting the origins of slanderous flatterers,\nsilencing the specious debates of petty sophists,\nabolishing the harsh *Five Punishments*,\nremoving burdensome and oppressive affairs,\nbanishing the traces of idle gossip,\nsealing the gates of factional cliques,\ndulling sharp wit,\nfollowing great constancy,\nignoring bodily refinements,\ndiscarding cleverness,\nall things return to their roots in grand harmony.\n\nSages do not create the times—\nthey act when the times arrive without faltering,\nand thus the course is never broken.\n\nAncient rulers established their teachings,\nwith the *Three Exalted Ministers* expounding the *Dao/Way*,\nharmonizing *Yin-Yang* principles,\npreserving what was lost,\nrestoring what was disordered.\n\nWhen sages arise, they uphold *the Dao/Way of virtue/power*,\nreinforced by the Seven *Rites of Virtue*,\ndismissing treacherous flatterers,\nremoving burdensome and oppressive affairs,\nbanishing the traces of idle gossip,\nsealing the gates of factional cliques,\nuniting the world into one household,\nwith descendants succeeding in governance.\n\nThe *Laozi* said:\n*\"The depth of the *Gonggong flood*,\nten fathoms deep yet untainted by dust,\ngold and jade within its heart manifest on the surface—\nit is not shallow nor unclean.\nYet fish, turtles, serpents, and dragons cannot dwell there.\nNo grains grow on barren stone,\nno deer roam the treeless hills—\nthere is no shelter nor refuge.\nThus, governance marked by severity is deemed discerning,\nby ruthlessness as clarity,\nby harshness as loyalty,\nby scheming as merit—\nsuch rule is like spreading wild grass,\na path to utter ruin and collapse.*\n\nWhen its governance is stifling, its people are pure;\nwhen its governance is probing, its people are depleted.\n\nWater too clear, fish and turtles dare not enter,\nfor fear of the nets and traps that harm them.\nBarren mountains, deer and elk refuse to dwell,\nlosing the shelter and protection that brings them peace.\nStone yields no grains, for it lacks the earth to root them.\n\nIn the *末世 (last age)*, rulers who govern with severity deemed as discernment,\nwho probe as clarity,\nwho oppress as loyalty,\nand who scheme as merit—\nsuch rulers are not chosen by enlightened *明主 (sages)*.\n\nThe *Laozi* said:\n*\"Govern with rectitude (*正*), wage war with the unexpected (*奇*).\nFirst establish a governance that cannot be overcome,\nthen seek victory over enemies.\nTo attack a land not yet governed is like responding to fire with fire,\nor water with water—\nthey cannot harmonize to resolve each other.\n\nThus, what is different is deemed the unexpected (*奇*).\nThe unexpected that is still is called restless (*躁*),\nthe unexpected in governance is called chaos (*乱*),\nthe unexpected in abundance is called hunger (*饥*),\nthe unexpected in ease is called toil (*劳*),\nand the unexpected in rectitude, when met with its opposite,\nis like water, fire, metal, and wood clashing in destruction—\nwhere shall they go without being overcome?\n\nHence, when *德 (virtue/power)* is balanced, the many overcome the few,\nwhen strength is matched, the wise subdue the foolish,\nand when wisdom is equal, those with strategy capture the countless.\n\nThe *Book of Wenzi* begins with the *皇 (August Sovereign)* and ends with the *霸 (Hegemon)*—\nits teachings on sovereign rule, kingship, and hegemony.\n\nTo govern with rectitude and wage war with the unexpected—\nthis is the universal principle of antiquity and the present.\n\nYet the *Hegemon* does otherwise:\nhe wages war with the unexpected,\nand governs with the unexpected as well—\nthus his governance becomes the unexpected itself,\nand his benevolence turns to *妖 (bewitching/chaotic)*.\n\nAlas, those who govern without rectitude,\nyet make the unexpected their sole concern—\nwhat use have they for many schemes?\n\nThe *Twelfth Chapter of the *通玄真经 (Scripture on the Perfection of the Dao)** concludes.",

He studied under Laozi. King Ping of Chu asked him, \"I have heard that you received the Dao from Lao Dan. May I be permitted to hear of it?\" Wenzi replied, \"The Dao and virtue rectify the crooked to make it straight, and restore order from chaos. When pure virtue revives, the world attains peace, and the key lies in one man. Thus, the accumulation of virtue makes a king, while the accumulation of wrath leads to ruin. Yao and Shun flourished by this principle, while Jie and Zhou perished by it.\" The king said, \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\"\n\nLater, Wenzi traveled south to Wu and Yue, where Fan Li became his disciple. When Yue planned to attack Wu, Fan Li remonstrated, \"Your servant has heard from his master: 'Weapons are instruments of ill omen. War is contrary to virtue. Strife is the least of affairs. To plot in secret and delight in instruments of ill omen, testing oneself in what is least important—this will not do.'\" Goujian did not heed him and was defeated at Fujiao. Later, Wenzi was offered the position of Grand Minister but declined. He withdrew to Mount Yu in Wuxing. Tradition holds that he ascended on clouds. According to the *Universal Geography* and the *Gazetteer of Wuxing*, thirty *li* southeast of Yuying lies Jichou Mountain, where the Grand Minister of Yue, Jiran, once ascended to survey the terrain, hence its name. Today, the Tongxuan Abbey atop White Stone Peak on the mountain’s south face marks his former retreat. The Ziyun Pass and Shengyuan Abbey were once the ancient Changqing Abbey, renamed by imperial decree during the Qiandao era of the Song. Halfway up the mountain stands the \"Cloud-Ascending Stone.\" Wenzi composed twelve chapters, titled *Wenzi*, and during the Tang dynasty, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Penetrating the Mysteries, while his book was titled *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries*.\n\n**Preface to the Comprehensive Annotations on the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries**\nThe *Wenzi* is a transmission of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Laozi based his work on the *Book of Changes* to compose his text, while Wenzi modeled himself on Laozi to establish his teachings. Thus, he elucidated the Way of the Yellow Emperor and the Three Sovereigns. For those who would be rulers, he prescribed the governance of Fuxi and the Divine Farmer; for the people, he envisioned the era of Datian and Getian. His concern for the world was profound indeed. Yet later generations failed to fathom his intent, and some even slandered his work.",

      "translated_text": "Now the Recluse of Nangu, Master Du, delved into the profundities of the *Book of Changes* and Laozi, harmonizing the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, ever holding the composition of texts and the establishment of discourse as his heart’s intent. Among his works that circulated in the world was *The Original Purport of the Dao and Its Virtue* in several scrolls. Initially dwelling on Mount Jishou in Wuxing, he sought the extraordinary and inquired into antiquity, discovering the former abode of Wenzi. There, he founded the White Stone Abbey of Penetrating the Mysteries and recovered *The Complete Works of Wenzi*. Thus, he divided its chapters, parsed its sentences, compiled annotations with appended explications, enabling learners to perceive the Dao with a single glance.\n\nI have often said that since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the celestial Way has flowed from north to south, and the sagely dynasty, tracing its origins, holds the primal destiny of the northern lands. Once the Six Directions are unified as one household, the age of primordial vastness is restored. Today, the Recluse of Nangu, responding to the mandate, composes texts to illuminate the imperial Dao, seeking to place this world within the realm of Huaxu. That a recluse of the mountains and forests does not forget the heart of aiding the ruler and benefiting the people is truly worthy of esteem. Our teaching has found its man, and thus I joyfully inscribe this preface.\n\nIn the third year of the Zhida era, on the first day of the sixth month, Wu Quanjie, the Lineage Master of the Mysterious Teaching, respectfully wrote.\n\nIn antiquity, when scholars served their families and states, they invariably had recluses beyond the world as their teachers, honing and tempering them, imparting their texts, and exhausting their teachings, so that their achievements were accomplished and their names established. Among them was the Grand General of Yue, Fan Li, whose teacher was Jiran. Jiran personally beheld the sages in the declining Zhou, yet harbored his supreme treasure without display. He thoroughly investigated the celestial Way, human affairs, the rise and fall of strength and weakness, and the principles of spontaneity, composing twelve scrolls. Fan Li applied these to pacify Wu and establish Yue’s hegemony, and later, with their remaining threads, preserved his life and enriched his household, accumulating and dispersing thrice, safeguarding his illustrious name. Observing Fan Li’s beginning and end confirms the truth of his teacher’s Way; examining Fan Li’s repeated remonstrances to Goujian reveals that they were all his teacher’s words. His work ranks among the Daoist masters.\n\nLiu Zihou pruned its redundancies and contradictions, extracting its essence and subtleties to form his own text, which elucidated its meaning well, though regrettably it did not survive. Master Nangu, following maps, discovered the mountain of Jiran’s former residence, perched upon its towering peaks, gazing down upon the vast expanse of Lake Tai. Having built a chamber to emulate its likeness, he further took *Wenzi* to compile annotations, fusing and penetrating its depths, smoothing its ruggedness, and unfolding the hidden treasures of the Yellow Emperor and the hegemons. Alongside his *Original Purport of the Mysterious Scripture*, it now circulates in the world. The Master is a man of the Way—his purity, diligence, frugality, and non-contention yet mastery of victory deeply embody the essence of the Keeper of the Pillars. His words and deeds, as seen in the discourses of officials and commoners alike, have already been engraved in stone and printed on fine woodblocks.\n\nYet Sima Qian’s appraisal of Tao Zhu laments his toiling body and striving strength in deep counsel with Yue, and again notes his toiling body and striving strength to amass wealth of tens of millions, repeating himself without weariness. In this, the Master’s affairs differ, yet their merit is the same; his name is lofty, yet he does not enjoy its riches. Thus, what he has gained from Jiran’s work—how could it lie in the mere ends of written characters and sentences? Separated by a thousand years, they truly seem to align as if tallying tokens.\n\nIt is regrettable that while many eminent officials and great men know the Master, and not a few have come to his gate to inquire of the Way, they have yet to fully employ his teachings as the ancients did in statecraft. Is it that their faith in the Way is not yet sincere? Do the recluses of the mountains and forests not forget this world, while the meat-eating officials do? If not, then why do they revere our Laozi’s Way as they do?\n\nThus, I record the origins of Fan Li and his teacher at the head of this text, awaiting the era of Great Flourishing.\n\nIn the mid-summer of the Gengxu year, Huang Shiweng, a Daoist of Mount Lu residing at the Lodge of the Southern Perfected, inscribed this.\n\nThose who ruled all under Heaven in antiquity: the highest practiced non-action, the next practiced action. Thus, the August One transformed through the Dao, the Emperor taught through virtue, the King exhorted through merit, and the Hegemon led through force. Their governance was like the four seasons. The celestial Way flows on its own—it is not something human effort can compel. Yet while times may be opportune for action, the Dao is never ultimately obstructed. Winter transforms, and spring endures within the year; the Hegemon transforms, and the August One endures within the ruler. This is why Wenzi composed his work, and the imperial Dao was illuminated.\n\nWenzi was a grandson of the state of Jin, surnamed Xin, named Xing, styled Jiran, and known by his epithet, Wenzi. His family resided in Kuiqiu of Sui, a region of Song, and he was also called Song Xing. He studied under Laozi and early attained the great Dao. He composed twelve scrolls, titled *Wenzi*, which returned to Laozi’s words, expounding the Way of Heaven and humanity, the appropriateness of temporal changes, and gathering the essence of all antiquity into a single compilation—truly the pivot and essentials of ordering the world. King Ping of Chu summoned him to inquire of the Way, and Fan Li followed him as his teacher, with Goujian appointing him as a grandee. Assisting Yue in pacifying Wu, he achieved merit without claiming it, retiring to the lands of Mount Yu, where he ascended the clouds and departed as an immortal. The region of Jishou in Wuxing was his former abode.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the scholar Xu Lingfu, who had secluded himself for cultivation on Mount Heng, presented Wenzi’s work to the throne. Thus, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Penetrating the Mysteries, and his book was titled *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries*.\n\nBorn on the left bank of the Yangtze and aging in the land of Wu, I sought the remnants of Wenzi’s legacy and built the White Stone Abbey of Penetrating the Mysteries. There, I obtained Wenzi’s original compilation. In my leisure, I divided its chapters and compiled annotations, assisting in the flourishing of the mysterious wind. As for the distinctions between transformation and teaching, exhortation and leading, the merit of virtue and the efficacy of force—these are not without hope for the world’s great worthies.\n\nThe humble disciple, Du Daojian of Nangu in Dangtu, respectfully inscribed this preface.\n\n**Comprehensive Annotations on the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, Scroll One**\nCompiled by Du Daojian, the Master of Nangu\n\nAt the beginning of each chapter, *Wenzi* frequently cites \"Laozi says,\" out of reverence for his teacher. This likely records Laozi’s words as they were learned at the time, and thus he dared not claim authorship for himself. The work comprises twelve scrolls, totaling one hundred and eighty-eight chapters. Though I, Daojian, am of shallow and crude understanding, I have divided them according to their meanings, adding eighty-one chapters. Each chapter is distinguished by its purport and titled *Comprehensive Annotations* to facilitate perusal.",

Thus, he elucidated the Way of the Yellow Emperor and the Three Sovereigns.

Yet later generations failed to fathom his intent, and some even slandered his work.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on the Origin of the Dao**\n\nLaozi says: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth. It has appearance but no form, profound and obscure, silent and serene. No sound is heard from it. I force a name upon it and call it the Dao.\n\nNow, the Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure. It embraces Heaven and Earth, bestowing without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, empty yet never full. When turbid, it slowly clarifies through stillness. Its giving is inexhaustible, unbound by time. Though it may be held in a single grasp, it contracts yet expands, dark yet luminous, soft yet firm. It harbors yin and exhales yang, manifesting the three lights.\n\nMountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it. Beasts run by it, birds fly by it. Scales glide by it, phoenixes soar by it. Stars and constellations move by it.\n\nBy loss it gains existence, by humility it attains honor, by retreat it advances first.\n\nThe Dao originates in Heaven, and the myriad things grow thereby.\n\nThe Dao is but a forced name—what name is not forced?\n\nThus, that which gives birth to Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad things, transforms being and non-being, and eludes comprehension of its mystery is the Dao. That which pacifies the world, comforts the multitudes, governs advance and retreat, life and death, without losing its correctness is the sage.\n\nOnly by knowing the Dao can loss become existence, humility become honor, and retreat become precedence.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the essence of the Dao. Standing at the center, their spirits roamed with transformation, governing the four directions. Thus, they could turn the heavens and move the earth, wheeling without cease, flowing like water without end. They began and ended with things, wind rising and clouds forming, thunder rumbling and rain falling, all responding without limit.\n\nCarved and polished, they returned to simplicity.\n\nActing without action, they harmonized life and death. Speaking without words, they penetrated Dao and virtue. Serene and unassuming, they attained harmony. Though things differ in myriad ways, they all thrive thereby.\n\nThey harmonized yin and yang, regulated the four seasons, balanced the five phases, moistened grasses and trees, permeated metal and stone. Beasts grew large, fur and feathers lustrous. Bird eggs did not spoil, beast fetuses did not miscarry. Fathers knew no grief for lost sons, elder brothers no sorrow for dead younger brothers. Children were not orphaned, women not widowed. Rainbows did not appear, thieves did not arise—such were the fruits of embodying virtue.\n\nThe rulers of high antiquity took the Heavenly Dao as the foundation of governance, roaming in unity with creation.\n\nThus, when Dao was pure and virtue complete, the people prospered and things flourished, each fulfilling its nature.\n\nWhen the Dao was not violated, nothing was harmed.\n\nThe great constant Dao gives life without possession, transforms without dominion. The myriad things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; depend on it to die, yet none can resent it.\n\nIt gathers and stores without growing richer, distributes and bestows without becoming poorer.\n\nVague and indistinct, it cannot be grasped as form. Elusive and fleeting, its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds without shape. Penetrating and unobstructed, it moves not in vain. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang.\n\nIt gives life without being born, transforms without transforming—this is called the great constant Dao.\n\nThe sage follows it, ruling the world and cherishing the people as children.\n\nWhen transformation flows and Dao aligns, it is an age of flourishing virtue.\n\nLaozi says: The great man is tranquil and thoughtless, composed and carefree. He takes Heaven as his canopy, Earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and yin and yang as his drivers.\n\nHe travels where there are no roads, roams without weariness, departs without gates.\n\nTaking Heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered. Taking Earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. Taking the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded. Taking yin and yang as his drivers, nothing is left unguided.\n\nThus, he moves swiftly without swaying, travels far without fatigue. His limbs do not stir, his hearing and vision do not falter, yet he illuminates all under Heaven—this is the essence of holding the Dao and observing the boundless.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and guide them. The changes of the myriad things cannot be fathomed; one must grasp their essentials and return to them.\n\nThus, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. He sharpens his spirit and stills his knowledge and perceptions. Thus, he is effortlessly without action yet accomplishes all, governs without governing yet nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nThe so-called \"non-action\" is not acting before things do. The so-called \"non-governance\" is not altering the natural. The so-called \"nothing left ungoverned\" is following the mutual arising of things.\n\nThe Dao resides within me, uniting with Heaven as one.\n\nA state’s ministers and aides are like Heaven’s seasons and times.\n\nWhen the great man emerges to assist a wise ruler, governing the people’s fate, observing the celestial timing, understanding the principles of things, following the Dao of nature, and enacting the transformation of non-action, then his person is cultivated, and governance knows no disorder.\n\nLaozi says: He who holds the Dao to govern the people responds to events as they arise, follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their answer; the changes of the hundred affairs all find their match.\n\nThus, the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these five are the forms and images of the Dao.\n\nEmptiness and nothingness are the Dao’s abode. Levelness and ease are the Dao’s essence. Clarity and stillness are the Dao’s mirror. Softness and weakness are the Dao’s function. Reversion is the Dao’s constant. Softness is the Dao’s hardness. Weakness is the Dao’s strength. Purity and simplicity are the Dao’s trunk.\n\nThe great Dao has no form; great peace has no image—hence, emptiness and nothingness.\n\nLevelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these are the Dao.\n\nAs for forms and images, are they truly forms? Are they truly images? Only he who does not cling to forms and images and thereby attains the use of the profound and mysterious can be spoken to of the Dao of governing the people.",

      "translated_text": "Emptiness means the center bears no burden. Levelness means the heart harbors no cares. Desires and cravings not borne—this is the perfection of emptiness. No preferences or aversions—this is the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity—this is the perfection of stillness. Unmixed with things—this is the perfection of purity. Neither sorrow nor joy—this is the perfection of virtue.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate is centered in emptiness; spirit and clarity abide with it. When a person’s heart is empty, the Dao naturally resides within. If even one thing is borne, desires and cravings will obstruct; likes and dislikes will arise, and spirit will depart. When spirit departs, the Dao is lost—how then can the body not perish? Only one of perfect virtue remains unmixed with things, unwavering in unity, the heart empty and qi level—what sorrow or joy could there be?\n\nThe governance of the perfected person discards cleverness and erases ornamentation, relying on the Dao and abandoning cunning, emerging with the people from impartiality. Narrowing what is guarded, reducing what is sought, casting aside allurements and desires, diminishing thoughts and cares—narrowing what is guarded brings clarity; reducing what is sought brings attainment. Thus, with the inner regulating the outer, no affair is neglected. If the inner attains, the outer can be shepherded. When the inner attains, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts are level, sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes are keen.\n\nThe great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—those who seek it afar go forth only to return. Ornament obscures substance; broad learning drowns the heart. When the external is heavy, the internal is light—thus the great man dwells in reality, not in its blossoms.\n\nThe governance of the perfected person has no other way—reverent silence and non-action alone. Turning inward to seek the Dao—how distant is it? Laozi said: The sage forgets governing others and attends to self-cultivation; esteems forgetting power and position and attends to self-attainment—self-attainment is when the world attains me. Joy forgets wealth and honor and attains harmony; knowing the great self and diminishing the world—this approaches the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. The sage is without fame, not forgetting their merit; the spirit person is without merit, not forgetting the self. The perfected person is without self—not that they lack a body, but that they enlarge the self and diminish the world.\n\nOnly those who act with something to rely upon—thus the sage’s great treasure is position. The Dao shapes and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, beginning and ending without form, still and unmoving, greatly penetrating and profoundly obscure, vast and boundless—it cannot be made external; splitting the finest hair or dividing the smallest point cannot make it internal. Without walls or roof, it gives birth to the general name of being and non-being.\n\nThe true person embodies it with emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity, remaining unmixed with things—thus attaining the Dao of heaven and earth, and so called a true person. The Dao has no form, thus it can shape and nurture the ten thousand things; the Dao has no name, thus it can encompass all existents. The true person embodies the Dao, emptying the heart and stilling the spirit—thus attaining the Dao of heaven and earth.\n\nThe true person enlarges the self and diminishes the world, esteems governing the body and disdains governing others, does not allow things to disturb harmony, does not let desires confuse the emotions, conceals their name and identity—when the Dao is present, they remain hidden; when the Dao is absent, they appear. They practice non-action, engage in non-affairs, know non-knowing.\n\nEmbracing the great Dao, encompassing the heart of heaven, exhaling and inhaling yin and yang, expelling the old and taking in the new, closing with yin, opening with yang, rolling and unfolding with hardness and softness, bowing and rising with yin and yang, sharing the heart of heaven, sharing the body of the Dao. Without joy, without suffering, without delight, without anger, the myriad things are profoundly the same—without right, without wrong.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the body is exhausted and spirit is blocked; when spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and care, spirit is spent and the body remains in excess. Thus the true person employs the heart to restore nature, relying on spirit for mutual support, thereby attaining beginning and end. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is without sorrow.\n\nBending outwardly—this is the human Dao; straightening inwardly—this is the heavenly Dao. Inwardly straight and outwardly bending, heaven and humanity correspond—there has never been one who did not succeed. Thus the true person conceals their name and identity—when the Dao is present, they remain hidden, not usurping others’ merit; when the Dao is absent, they appear, to remedy the age’s ills.\n\nOnly one who shares the heart of heaven and the body of the Dao can restore nature and rely on spirit, mutually supporting to attain beginning and end. Confucius asked the Dao of Laozi, who said: Correct your form, unify your gaze, and heavenly harmony will arrive; gather your knowledge, rectify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, the Dao will be your abode. Bright-eyed as a newborn calf, without seeking the old; form like withered wood, heart like dead ashes—truly knowing reality without crookedness, thus self-sustaining and expansive, no heart to scheme, luminous in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\n\nThe Dao has substance and function; the sage has no dual heart. The mysterious sage and the unadorned king—substance and function are two, but the Dao is one. Confucius, a sage of heaven’s endowment—how could he not know the Dao? Yet he asked Laozi, surely to gain what lies beyond words. Thus there is the deception of the dragon.\n\nLaozi said: One who attends to life responds to change and acts; change arises from the times—one who knows the times has no constant conduct. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Writing arises from words; words emerge from knowledge—those with knowledge do not know, for it is not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not one who hoards books.\n\nExcessive words lead to exhaustion—better to guard the center. Cut off learning and be without sorrow; cut off sagacity and abandon knowledge, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Books carry words; words carry the Dao. Esteeming books is esteeming the Dao. Thus, one who knows the times responds to change when affairs arise; one who knows books—words emerge from knowledge, but those with knowledge do not know.",

      "translated_text": "Only by not clinging to books nor stagnating in affairs, cutting off learning and abandoning knowledge, can one begin to speak of the art of responding to change.\n\nMan is tranquil at birth—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, he stirs—this is the desire of nature. When things arrive, he responds—this is the movement of knowledge. As knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise; when likes and dislikes take form, knowledge turns outward, unable to return to the self, and Heaven’s principle is extinguished. Thus, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, outwardly transforming with things while inwardly preserving true nature. Therefore, one who penetrates the Dao returns to clarity and stillness; one who exhausts things ends in non-action. Nurture knowledge with tranquility, unite the spirit with emptiness—thus entering the gateless gate.\n\nThose who follow Heaven wander with the Dao; those who follow men mingle with the vulgar. Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, nor disorder true nature with desires. Without scheming, he is fitting; without speaking, he is trusted; without pondering, he attains; without acting, he accomplishes. Therefore, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands before them, none feel harmed. The world turns to him, the wicked fear him, for he contends with nothing—who then would dare contend with him?\n\nHeaven’s nature is fundamentally still; worldly desires disturb it. When stillness moves, Heaven’s nature is defiled. Only the sage, outwardly transforming with things while his heart wanders with Heaven, merges self and other in profound unity—what contention could there be?\n\nLaozi said: \"When man follows desire, he loses his nature; his movements are never upright. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to invite defilement.\" Thus, those who have not heard the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain clarity and stillness. Human nature is originally free from depravity—long immersed in things, it changes; changing, it forgets its root and merges with what seems natural.\n\nWater’s nature desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it; man’s nature desires equilibrium, yet cravings harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. Thus, the sage does not enslave things with knowledge, nor disturb harmony with desire. In joy, he is not exuberant; in sorrow, he is not distressed. Therefore, though exalted, he is not imperiled; though secure, he does not topple. Hearing good words and expedient plans, even the foolish delight in them; praising sagely virtue and lofty conduct, even the unworthy admire them. Many delight in such words, but few employ them; many admire such conduct, but few practice it. The reason lies in being entangled by things and bound by custom.\n\nThus it is said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I am without affairs, and the people prosper themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people simplify themselves.\" When the heart is still, it is bright; when water is still, it is clear—this is principle. If learning is not upright, habit shapes nature, and stillness becomes movement, clarity becomes obscurity. Encountering a worthy teacher and hearing good words, if the heart awakens, one may restore one’s nature.\n\nOriginally, Heaven united with the great Dao. Applying this to cultivate the self perfects the self; applying it to govern the state perfects the state. Thus, the sage’s Dao is this: above, he practices non-action, and the people transform themselves; above, he is without affairs, and the people prosper themselves; above, he loves stillness, and the people rectify themselves; above, he is without desire, and the people simplify themselves.\n\nClarity and stillness are the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the myriad things. When these three are practiced, one merges with the formless—the formless is called the One. The One is the mindless union with all under Heaven.\n\nVirtue is spread without irrigation; its use is not labored. It is seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard. From the formless, forms arise; from the soundless, the five notes resound; from the tasteless, the five flavors take shape; from the colorless, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, fullness from emptiness.\n\nThe number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible to the ear; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are inexhaustible to the palate; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are inexhaustible to the eye. When the note *gong* is established, the five notes take form; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; when whiteness is established, the five colors are complete; when the One is established, the myriad things are born.\n\nThus, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the blessing of the One pervades Heaven and Earth. In its wholeness, it is simple as uncarved wood; in its dispersion, it is vast as turbid waters. Turbid, it gradually clears; empty, it gradually fills. Vast as the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent yet present, seemingly lost yet existing.\n\nThe Dao is formless yet gives birth to form, beginning in the beginningless, ending in the endless. The primordial qi arises from the Great Simplicity. Is the Great Simplicity not the ancestor of the myriad things? From the One come the Two, and yin and yang divide; the five qi spread, and the myriad transformations flourish.\n\nThe sage’s heart unites with the Great Simplicity—clear, still, empty, and void. Virtue covers the four seas, and the myriad things return to him, yet he does not act as their master. The Dao is great and formless, one with Heaven. As for the ear’s delight in sound, the eye’s delight in color, the mouth’s delight in flavor—these are what man shares with others. How could the sage take them to heart?\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the myriad things all passes through one opening; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from one gate.\" Thus, the sage follows the single standard, does not alter the ancient ways, does not change the constant norms. He takes the level as his model, the plumb line as his guide, bending and conforming to the constant.\n\nJoy and anger are the Dao’s perversities; sorrow and grief are virtue’s losses; likes and dislikes are the heart’s transgressions; cravings and desires are life’s burdens. Great anger shatters yin; great joy collapses yang; thin qi brings dimness; terror induces madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, and illness forms as accumulations. If one can eliminate these five, one unites with spirit brightness.\n\nSpirit brightness is attained within. Those who attain it within find their five viscera at peace, thoughts and deliberations balanced, ears and eyes keen, sinews and bones strong and straight. Open and unobstructed, not perverse; firm and strong, not exhausted. Nothing in excess, nothing unattainable.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao, does it not embrace all mysteries and encompass the myriad things? Through spirit it is made luminous, through resonance it is made penetrating—revealing the hidden, elucidating the subtle, present without exception. Thus, things obtain it and flourish; the people obtain it and thrive; the timely ruler obtains it and may embody the august standard to govern the four quarters.\n\nNothing in the world is more yielding than water, yet in water lies the Dao. Its breadth cannot be fathomed, its depth cannot be sounded; its length stretches without end, its reach extends without limit. Its ebb and flow, its gain and loss, surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes heaven’s rain and dew; below, it becomes earth’s moisture and nourishment. Without it, the myriad things cannot live; without it, the hundred affairs cannot be accomplished. It embraces all life without partiality, bestows grace upon dragons and serpents without seeking repayment, enriches the world without exhaustion, extends virtue to the people without depletion. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Bind it and it is not constrained; pierce it and it is not wounded; sever it and it is not cut; scorch it and it is not scorched. Flowing and compliant, it cannot be scattered; its benefit penetrates metal and stone, pervades the world. Surplus or deficiency, it allows the world to take or give; it receives the myriad things without preference, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal to heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.\n\nThat water can perfect its utmost virtue lies in its softness, compliance, and smoothness. Thus it is said: The softest in the world gallops through the hardest; nothing enters where there is no gap. The One generates water, which beneficially nourishes the myriad things—its merit is most vast. Heaven without water cannot revolve; earth without water cannot bear; things without water cannot live; the people without water cannot survive. Rain and dew in the four seasons moisten and nourish all species. Flowing and compliant, dwelling below without contention, Yu’s virtue resembled it—thus he could accord with water’s nature and bring the earth to order, heaven to completion.\n\nThe formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great progenitor of kinds. The perfected person communicates with the numinous treasury, becoming one with the creator, holding profound virtue in the heart, and transforming like a spirit. Thus, the Dao that is not a Dao—how vast and indistinct it is! Without issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the power of conduct in the heart.\n\nThe myriad things have their origins, yet only the Dao knows their roots; the hundred affairs have their sources, yet only the Dao guards their gates. Thus it can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond without knowing. The Dao has no fixed form; it assumes form according to things—transformation is manifest. Virtue has no constant teacher; it takes goodness as its teacher—substance and function are attained.\n\nThus the perfected person harbors the Dao and virtue, communicates with spirit brightness. Things have their origins—only the Dao knows their roots. Affairs have their sources—only the Dao guards their gates. Inexhaustible and boundless, it becomes one with the creator. Laozi said: Those who attain the Dao have a will that is weak yet their affairs are strong; their hearts are empty yet their responses are fitting. A weak will is soft, delicate, tranquil, concealed in not daring, acting in not being able, serene and non-active, moving without missing the moment. Thus the noble must take the lowly as its foundation, the high must take the low as its base. Relying on the small to embrace the great, being within to control the external, acting with softness yet being firm, its strength is invincible, its enemies undefeatable. Responding to transformations and measuring the times, nothing can harm it.\n\nThose who desire firmness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes firmness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or demise. Strength overcomes what is inferior to itself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is checked. Softness overcomes what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, when armies are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break; when leather is strong, it splits. The teeth are firmer than the tongue yet perish first. Thus softness and weakness are the stems of life; firmness and strength are the companions of death. When things turn against me, the Dao abides in the heart.\n\nKnowing my heaven, knowing others’ heaven, and knowing things’ heaven—this is attainment. Water is utterly soft, yet when it bears a boat, it is firm; the people are utterly weak, yet when they support a ruler, they are strong. Those who skillfully employ the Dao can guard softness and weakness to overcome firmness and strength. The first to sing paves the path to exhaustion; the last to act reaches the source of success.\n\nThose who hold the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, they control the other. Why? They do not lose what controls others, and others cannot control them. The so-called \"last\" adjusts its calculations to align with the time. When time changes, the interval does not allow for pause. Acting first is excessive; acting last is insufficient. The sun revolves, the moon cycles—time does not wait for people. Thus the sage does not value a foot of jade but values an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easy to lose, so the sage acts according to the time, establishes merit according to resources, upholds the pure Dao, adheres to the feminine principle, follows along and responds to change, always remaining behind yet never ahead. Soft and weak in stillness, tranquil and composed in stability, their achievements are vast and nothing is too firm—they cannot be contested.\n\nWhen affairs arise, respond—the Dao values attaining the mean. Excess and deficiency both harm affairs. Only by not losing the proper time in first and last is the mean attained and all affairs accomplished. Thus the sage’s appearance and withdrawal are timely, their first and last have measure. If I do not lose control over others, then others cannot control me.\n\nLaozi said: When the heart harbors scheming, purity is not unsullied. When spiritual virtue is not complete in the body, how can one embrace what is distant? When the heart forgets the desire to harm, even a starving tiger can be tailed—how much more so with people?\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet not exhausted; those who rely on calculations are laborious yet without achievement. Ruling through laws, punishments, and executions is not the enterprise of emperors and kings; frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to govern for the long term. Excessive likes and dislikes bring calamity in their wake. Thus the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, to follow is great, to create is petty; to uphold is firm, to act is to fail. Grasping at schemes and pursuing a starving tiger—one barely escapes the tiger’s jaws. Only when I harbor no scheming heart does the tiger bring no harm.\n\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao are at ease, while those who rely on calculations are laborious. The principles of the world are not difficult to perceive: what is easy is readily known, what is simple is readily followed. When laws lack the harshness of punishments, governance becomes effortless; when governance dispenses with the frequent use of the whip, it can endure for the long term. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions were not to suppress evil but to uphold what was right. Only thus could they establish a lasting and great enterprise.\n\nThose who rely on ears and eyes for hearing and seeing exhaust the heart yet remain unclear; those who govern through cunning and planning strain the heart yet achieve nothing. Relying on the talents of one person is insufficient to bring order; the ability of one person cannot even govern a three-acre homestead. Yet by following the principles of the Dao and aligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth, the Six Directions are not too vast to harmonize.\n\nTo lose judgment in praise or blame, to be dazzled by gaudy colors, to rely on ritual alone is insufficient to restrain desire—only a sincere heart can embrace what is distant. Thus, no weapon is sharper than the will, yet fine blades are inferior; no enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet war drums are trivial. The greatest foe lies in unspoken restraints, the middling hides in the mountains, the petty lurks among the people.\n\nThus it is said: when the people abound in cleverness, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits flourish. To reject one and adopt the other is to invite no heavenly calamity. Therefore, to govern a state through cunning is to plunder it; to govern without cunning is to bless it. When seeing and hearing are labored, the heart is unclear; when schemes and plans are overburdened, affairs are ungoverned. To rely on the talents of one person to seek order is difficult indeed.\n\nA sincere heart can embrace what is distant; collective strength can achieve success—even the Six Directions are not too vast to harmonize. What ails the body is crowned by yin and yang; what plunders the state is crowned by treachery. To govern without cunning is the fortune of the state.\n\nWhat is formless is great, what has form is petty; what is formless is abundant, what has form is scant; what is formless is strong, what has form is weak; what is formless is solid, what has form is hollow. What has form is the completion of affairs, what is formless is their inception. The completion of affairs produces tools, their inception is uncarved simplicity. What has form has sound, what is formless has no sound; what has form arises from what is formless—thus what is formless is the beginning of what has form.\n\nVastness and thickness bear names, and what bears a name is prized for its wholeness; frugality and thinness are nameless, and what is nameless is base and light. Abundance bears a name, and what bears a name is honored and esteemed; poverty and scarcity are nameless, and what is nameless is lowly and despised. The male bears a name, and what bears a name manifests virtue; the female is nameless, and what is nameless remains hidden and restrained. Surplus bears a name, and what bears a name is exalted and wise; deficiency is nameless, and what is nameless is assigned to the lowly. Merit brings a name, lack of merit brings none. What bears a name arises from what is nameless—what is nameless is the mother of what bears a name.\n\nThe Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete one another. Thus the sage holds to the Dao’s emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery to perfect their virtue. Therefore, where there is the Dao, there is virtue; where there is virtue, there is merit; where there is merit, there is a name; where there is a name, there is a return to the Dao. Merit and name endure, and one remains free from fault throughout life.\n\nAll things under Heaven arise from being, being arises from non-being—thus what is formless is the beginning of what has form. The Dao is nameless, things bear names, yet the nameless is the mother of what bears a name. Know which is closer: name or self? Which is weightier: self or wealth? Then name need not be exalted, wealth need not be abundant.\n\nThus the sage holds to the Dao to perfect their virtue. With merit accomplished, they withdraw—from ancient times to the present, their name does not fade. Kings and lords possess merit and name, the orphaned and widowed possess neither. Thus it is said: the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root. With merit accomplished, they do not claim it—thus they use merit for benefit and namelessness for function.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their appearance did not depart from their nature, their words did not exceed their actions, their conduct required no adornment, their speech was unembellished. Their clothes provided warmth without ornament, their weapons were blunt and unsharpened. They walked with unsteady steps, gazed with unfocused eyes, dug wells to drink, tilled fields to eat. They neither bestowed nor sought virtue. High and low did not vie, long and short did not compare.\n\nCustoms were uniform and could be followed, tasks matched abilities and were easily performed. Those who flaunted deceit to delude the world or behaved erratically to mislead the masses—the sage did not make this the people’s way.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their speech was unadorned, their clothes uncolored. They tilled to eat, dug wells to drink, neither bestowed nor sought, each content with their own.\n\nThus kings and great lords called themselves orphaned and widowed, and those who possessed the Dao did not destroy themselves for name, did not kill the people with governance, did not exhaust descendants with wealth, did not harm the world with learning. Later generations did not burden their hearts with merit, name, profit, or emolument.

      "translated_text": "**Comprehensive Exegesis of the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, Scroll Two**\n*South Valley Master Du Daojian’s Annotated Compilation*\n\n**Chapter on Sincerity**\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun and moon shine, the stars in their ranks gleam; yin and yang harmonize—yet none of this is by deliberate action.\n\nAlign with the Dao, and things arise of themselves. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nurture grasses and trees. Yet when numinous clarity meets, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within, shelters spirit in the heart, still and silent, serene and unperturbed, joyfully at peace in the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless—government offices as if empty, the court as if deserted. No recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. All under heaven gaze upward in reverence of the ruler’s virtue, in emulation of the sovereign’s intent. Even distant lands of alien customs, none fail to arrive through successive interpreters—not because they journey to each household to meet the people, but because the ruler extends his sincere heart to all under heaven.\n\nThus, to reward the good and punish the violent is to issue commands; what enables their execution is sincerity. Commands, though clear, cannot act alone—they must await sincerity. Therefore, when the Dao is universally applied to the people yet they do not follow, it is because sincerity has not reached them.\n\nThe sages of antiquity governed heaven and earth, administered the myriad things, stored essence and preserved sincerity—formless and soundless. They aligned with the Dao and entrusted things to their own nature. In that age, the court had no favored ministers, the wilds no neglected recluses, the state no vagrant people. Weapons were not raised, labor was not imposed, and the four classes delighted in their work. Thus, without visiting each household to instruct the people, supreme peace was effortlessly achieved.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven established the sun and moon, arrayed the stars, extended the four seasons, and regulated yin and yang. Day exposes, night rests; wind dries, rain and dew moisten. In generating things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things perish—this is called numinous clarity.\n\nThus, the sage emulates this: when blessings arise, none see their cause, yet blessings arise; when calamities are removed, none see their source, yet calamities vanish. Searched, they cannot be found; examined, they are not empty. Daily reckoning falls short, yearly reckoning exceeds. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is the movement of the celestial heart through transformation.\n\nThus, sincerity shapes qi within, moving heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. Rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge. The sun, moon, and stars are the spirits of heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone are the spirits of earth. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night—all are spirits. Human nature is most numinous, surpassing all things in spirit.\n\nHeaven nurtures things without revealing its care, yet daily they grow. The sage nurtures the people, removing harm and promoting benefit, doing likewise. All arises from sincerity manifesting within, qi moving heaven, yin and yang aligning, numinous spirits aiding—thus auspicious omens arrive.\n\nTo defy heaven and ravage things is to invite the sun and moon’s eclipse, the five stars’ misalignment, the four seasons’ disorder. Day darkens, night brightens; mountains collapse, rivers run dry; winter thunders, summer frosts. Heaven and humanity communicate thus. When a state declines, celestial signs alter, customs decay, rainbows appear—all things interconnect, essence and qi clash.\n\nTherefore, the workings of the numinous cannot be achieved by cunning or forced by strength. Thus, the great person joins virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon, numinosity with ghosts and spirits, and trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing the celestial heart, holding the earthly qi, grasping the mean and containing harmony, they do not leave their hall yet traverse the four seas, transforming customs. The people reform as if by their own will—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\nHeaven and humanity share one qi, the hidden and manifest interpenetrate. Harmonious qi brings blessings; pestilential qi brings misfortune—none arise apart from the ruler. Thus, to defy heaven and ravage things, to violate the Dao and corrupt virtue, is to provoke the wrath of august heaven, and calamity follows.\n\nAs when King Cheng repented his errors, the grain stalks bent and the wind reversed; when the Lord of Song spoke a single word, the Fire Star retreated—these were signs of sincerity moving heaven, turning misfortune to fortune.\n\nLaozi said: The human Dao is to preserve one’s nature and guard one’s authenticity, not to harm one’s body. When pressed by urgency or peril, essence connects with heaven. Those who have never departed from their origin—what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced.\n\nMoreover, to govern heaven and earth, administer the myriad things, return to the creative process, and contain supreme harmony is to never die. Sincerity takes shape within and outwardly resonates with the human heart—this is the untransmitted Dao.\n\nIn life, all receive their mandate from heaven alike. Thus, nature is not without goodness. To preserve one’s nature and guard one’s authenticity, not to harm one’s body, to connect essence with heaven—what could not be achieved? To return to the creative process, contain supreme harmony, and never die—this is the true person.\n\nWhen the sage rules above, embracing the Dao without speech, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—how vast and boundless! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit manifests in heaven, and the mutual resonance of spirit and qi is evident. This is the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken Dao.\n\nTo summon the distant, let there be no action; to draw close, let there be no speech. Only those who walk in darkness can attain this. Thus, horses are turned back to manure the fields, and chariot tracks do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called \"sitting in stillness while galloping in obscurity.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Dao of heaven is impartial in its approach, impartial in its departure—those who are capable have abundance, while the inept fall short. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it meet misfortune. Thus, governing through cunning makes it difficult to sustain a state; only by aligning with the Great Harmony and adhering to natural resonance can one attain this. The sage embraces the Dao, and his beneficence reaches the people—auspicious signs become visible. When ruler and minister diverge in heart, calamity manifests in heaven. The distant are summoned without action; the near are drawn close without speech. The mutual resonance of spirit and *qi* is evident—what need is there for summoning before they arrive?\n\nImpartial in approach, impartial in departure, abundance and insufficiency—all align with the Great Harmony. The teaching without words is simply the natural course. Laozi said: The Dao and virtue are like leather and hide—distance makes them seem near, closeness makes them seem distant. Scrutiny yields no grasp, observation finds no emptiness. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without hoarding. The myriad things are unharmed—what he gains is but loss, what he loses is but gain.\n\nTherefore, one who penetrates the Great Harmony is dark as if steeped in wine, sweetly reclining and roaming within it, as if never having departed from its source—this is called \"great penetration.\" This is the use that arises from non-use. The Dao is revered, virtue is esteemed—they differ in name but emerge from the same source, residing within our hearts, not obtained from without. It gives life and nurtures, neither non-existent nor existent.\n\nThe heart of the sage is like a bright mirror: things arrive and it responds; things depart and it is still. Embracing sincerity, pure in virtue and power—what failure could there be? Without attachment, what loss could occur? As if never having departed from its source, even spirits and gods cannot discern it.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ruled the world, harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the *qi* of yin and yang, ordering the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the calculations of pitch and calendar. He distinguished male and female, clarified superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not tyrannize the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were harmonious without blame. Laws and decrees were clear, not obscure; assistants were just, not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets did not engage in preemptive pricing. Thus, in that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts. Observing the Dao of heaven and grasping its workings, the Yellow Emperor attained governance of the world. Later, he relinquished the world, hastened to Kongtong, humbled himself to seek instruction, and asked Guangchengzi how to cultivate the body to achieve longevity.\n\nGuangchengzi said: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure. Its ultimate is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The body will naturally rectify itself—be still, be pure. Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence—only then can you attain long life.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on stone and slept on rope, slaying in autumn and executing in winter. He bore the square earth and embraced the round heaven, enveloped by yin and yang. Those obstructed and stagnant—where *qi* and principle were perverse, harming the people and accumulating excess—he severed and halted them. His people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west, their sight dim, their steps faltering. Yet they were artless and content, unaware of their drifting, floating without knowing their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing their destination.\n\nIn that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons—their achievements matched heaven and earth. Yet when the Yellow Emperor sought counsel beneath the Great Ancestor, he did not display his merits or proclaim his name, concealing the Dao of the true person to follow the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. Why? Because virtue and power ascend while cunning and artifice vanish.\n\nWhen the Six Eras neared their end and the Two Sovereigns did not appear, then Taihao Fuxi emerged. At that time, the Great Simplicity dispersed, and human affairs began to sprout—the world first saw action. Observing images, he fashioned tools; knotting cords into nets, he tamed birds and beasts. This was called Fuxi. Smelting metal into cauldrons, transforming raw into cooked, he was also named Paoxi. In that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes sheathed their claws and fangs, no longer harming people. Later, when he created writing and rectified human relations, his achievements matched heaven and earth, yet he did not regard them as accomplishments. Thus, he was revered as Taihao—was this not fitting?\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have no place to rest; if earth is unsettled, plants and trees have no place to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Thus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise. If what one holds is unclear, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance?\n\nAccumulating kindness and valuing wealth, making the people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, ordering ruler and minister, clarifying superior and inferior, distinguishing close and distant, preserving imperiled states, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. Closing the nine orifices, concealing will and intent, discarding wisdom and intelligence, returning to non-discernment, wandering blithely beyond the dust, roaming freely in the realm of no affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is virtue.\n\nThus, the Dao disperses into virtue, virtue overflows into benevolence and righteousness, and when benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned. The Dao and virtue in relation to the Five Constants are like yin and yang in relation to the Five Phases—they are one. Knowing that the sun and moon alternate in brightness, the four seasons proceed in succession, and only then is the year completed—this is understanding the human Dao. The Dao, virtue, and the Five Constants can coexist but cannot be without one another.\n\nThus, Laozi said: \"Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom; abandon benevolence, discard righteousness.\" Why? Because he detested their names being usurped and enacted falsely. If one truly had the heart to abandon them, then the *Dao* and *De* chapters would not speak of sages or benevolence and righteousness.",
      "overlap_context": " When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit manifests in heaven, and the mutual resonance of spirit and qi is evident. This is the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken Dao.\n\nTo summon the distant, let there be no action; to draw close, let there be no speech. Only those who walk in darkness can attain this. Thus, horses are turned back to manure the fields, and chariot tracks do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called \"sitting in stillness while galloping in obscurity.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the spirit scatters, words become florid; when virtue dissipates, conduct turns false. When the utmost essence radiates within yet speech and action are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things.\" When essence is exhausted through sorrow and conduct knows no bounds, what one holds fast to is unstable, and one becomes externally swayed by worldly customs.\n\nTherefore, the sage cultivates the Dao and virtue internally and does not adorn them externally with benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, they wander in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering. The Dao and virtue are the ancestors of the Five Constants; to have ancestors without descendants is impossible. Yet to have descendants while forgetting the ancestors—is this permissible? The Five Constants are the five spirits. When the Dao and virtue reside within, the spirit does not scatter without. Once one loses what they guard, the spirit scatters and words become florid, virtue dissipates and conduct turns false—few escape enslavement by things.\n\nOnly the sage, knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, wanders in the harmony of spirit—when the ancestor is preserved, how can the descendants not be preserved? Laozi said: \"As for the sage’s wandering, they move in perfect emptiness, roam the mind in the Great Void, gallop beyond boundaries, act without gates, listen without sound, see without form, unbound by the world, unshackled by custom.\" Thus, what the sage uses to move the world is not surpassed by the true person; what the worthy use to correct worldly customs is not observed by the sage.\n\nPeople bound by worldly customs inevitably have their forms constrained and spirits drained, and thus cannot escape entanglement. If what binds and restrains me must lie in something external, then when the body is not shackled by custom, others will not weary of me. When the mind is not bound by the world, I will not weary of others—this is called wandering with the Creator. Thus, what moves the world is not surpassed by the true person, and what corrects worldly customs is not observed by the sage.\n\nWhen the will is enslaved by things, the form is constrained and the spirit drained—even the worthy cannot always escape this, let alone the common people. Laozi said: \"The ruler’s thoughts do not manifest in the breast, nor does wisdom extend beyond the four quarters. Embracing a heart of benevolence and sincerity, timely sweet rains fall, the five grains flourish, spring births, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores. Monthly inspections and seasonal assessments are conducted, and tribute is offered at year’s end. Nurturing the people with impartiality, awe is instilled without admonition, laws are simple and not burdensome, transformation is as if divine, punishments are lenient and prisons empty. The world shares one custom, and none harbor treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s grace.\n\nWhen superiors covet without measure, inferiors vie for merit without restraint. The people grow poor and bitter, disputes arise, toil yields no reward, cunning and deceit sprout, thieves and bandits multiply, superiors and inferiors resent one another, and decrees go unheeded. When carriages share the same tracks and writing the same script, the world shares one custom. When rewards are not excessive and punishments not cruel, the four seas unite in heart. If this is achieved, the ruler’s thoughts do not extend beyond the four quarters, and transformation is as if divine.\n\nWhen superiors covet without limit, inferiors vie for merit without restraint. Cunning arises and the people’s strength is depleted; superiors and inferiors resent one another, heaven and earth do not interact, and the myriad things do not communicate. When water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When superiors are full of desires, inferiors grow deceitful; when superiors are restless, inferiors are unsettled; when superiors make many demands, inferiors contend with one another. To neglect the root and seek remedy in the branches is no different from digging channels to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire.\n\nThe sage’s affairs are few, their demands for governance minimal yet sufficient. Without acting, they are benevolent; without speaking, they are trusted; without seeking, they obtain; without striving, they accomplish. Embracing naturalness, preserving utmost sincerity, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows them as echo responds to sound, as shadow reflects form—what they cultivate is the root. Heaven displays omens to show good and ill fortune, and all see them. The ruler issues commands, clarifies rewards and punishments, and the people all trust them. Is the ruler not like heaven?\n\nWhen water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel—this is the inevitable principle. Thus, when superiors are full of desires, the people grow deceitful; when superiors favor stillness, the people do not contend. The sage, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, is followed by the world—this may be called knowing the root.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the spirit scatters without and wisdom dissipates within, governance cannot be achieved. When the use of form and spirit is distant, what is neglected is near. Thus, one who does not step beyond the door knows the world; one who does not peer through the window knows the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows—this speaks of essence and sincerity issuing from within, and spirit and qi moving heaven.\"\n\nHeaven and earth interact, and the myriad things communicate; the sage arises, and the myriad things behold—this is the Dao of natural resonance. The human heart connects with heaven, for in receiving form and destiny, one’s origin is from heaven itself. Thus, when essence and sincerity issue from within, spirit and qi move heaven. When the human heart is empty and bright, the light of heaven shines forth, like a mirror reflecting form—beauty and ugliness appear of themselves. How can the heart not be guarded?\n\nLaozi said: \"The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—all things return to them without limit. This is the resonance of utmost essence, coming unsummoned, departing without going, profound and obscure, accomplishing its work without one knowing how. To rely on the eyes to see or words to command makes governance difficult. Gaoyao was blind yet served as grand judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for words? Shi Kuang was blind yet served as grand minister, and the state of Jin knew no chaotic governance—what need was there for sight? The command that requires no words, the vision that requires no seeing—this is how the sage serves as teacher.\n\nThe burning mirror summons fire, yet without the sun, it does not flame; the square vessel summons water, yet without the moon, it does not flow. Thus, with the Dao but without position, affairs cannot be established.\"",

      "translated_text": "With position but without the Dao, achievements cannot be realized. When the rulers and ministers of Tang and Yu aligned in the Dao, transformation was perfected and teaching spread; the hundred officials were upright, and the myriad people submitted—this is why the sage serves as teacher for a hundred generations. The people’s transformation by their superiors does not follow their words but follows their conduct.\n\nThus, when a ruler favors courage, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many calamities, and its gradual decline will inevitably lead to the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into darkness and disorder, and its accumulation will reach the disaster of debauchery and dissipation. Therefore, the sage’s sincerity is distinguished within, and his likes and dislikes are clear without; his words match his feelings, and his commands clarify his intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to suppress villainy—only spiritual transformation is precious. Utmost essence is spirit, and where essence moves, it is like the spring’s vitality or the autumn’s withering.\n\nThus, the noble person is like an archer: what is a hair’s breadth here is a fathom’s length there. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them. When the standard is upright, its shadow is straight; when the source is clear, its flow is long—this is the Dao of mutual support between root and branch. Knowing the heart as the root of the body, one knows the ruler as the root of the people. Thus, a ruler’s preferences must not be unprincipled. Favoring courage gives rise to the chaos of robbery and murder; favoring beauty gives rise to the disaster of debauchery and dissipation. Only one who favors virtue distinguishes essence within and clarifies likes and dislikes without. Punishments go unused, yet villainy submits; with the root and foundation secure, the state naturally attains peace.\n\nLaozi said: \"When laws are displayed and rewards are set but cannot shift customs, it is because sincerity is not embraced.\" Thus, hearing its tone, one knows its customs; observing its music, one knows its mores; seeing its mores, one knows its transformation. Those who embrace truth and manifest sincerity move heaven and earth, and their spirit transcends all bounds. Commands are obeyed, and prohibitions are upheld; their Dao is penetrated, and their intent is conveyed. Though they utter not a word, the myriad people of the world, along with birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits, transform with them. Thus, the highest is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent.\n\nA mountain glows when it contains jade; a deep pool charms when it holds pearls—what is within manifests without. Water and stone are wordless, yet people trust them. When a state cherishes its benevolence and sincerity, extends its trustworthiness, punishes without resentment, and rewards without partiality, there is no need to display laws or set rewards, for the people will transform of their own accord. Thus, those who hear of Boyi’s virtue find the stubborn become incorruptible and the weak gain resolve—what words did Boyi speak? His person transformed them.\n\nIf words are spoken but not practiced, the people will not follow.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The Great Dao is non-action; non-action means non-possession, and non-possession means non-abiding. One who does not abide dwells in formlessness; one who is formless does not move; one who does not move does not speak. Without speech, there is stillness—soundless and formless. Soundless, it cannot be seen; formless, it cannot be heard. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the supremely spiritual. Vast and unceasing, it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Dao is formless and soundless, so the sage forces it into form, naming the Dao of Heaven and Earth with a single word. The great takes the small as its foundation; the many takes the few as its beginning. The Son of Heaven regards Heaven and Earth as his standard and all things as his resources. His merit and virtue are supreme, his power and renown most noble. The beauty of these two virtues matches Heaven and Earth, so he must follow the Great Dao as the mother of all under Heaven.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great ones: the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and the King. The Dao is non-action, thus enduring; Heaven is wordless, thus lofty and bright; Earth is soundless, thus vast and deep. To embody all three is to be a king. The king is the child of Heaven, the master of Earth, and the parent of the people. Only by lovingly nurturing all things without claiming it as favor does his merit and virtue become supreme, his power and renown most noble—none can surpass him.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving the poor and aiding the distressed gives rise to fame and profit; eliminating harm brings merit to completion. If the world is free from disasters, even sages have no virtue to display; if superiors and inferiors are harmonious, even the worthy have no merit to establish. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue and holds to the Dao, extending sincerity and delighting in giving. With boundless wisdom, he rests in silence and does not speak, yet none under Heaven fail to value his wordlessness.\n\nThus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\" What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and transmitted to others—these are but its coarse aspects. The Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings differed in their affairs but shared the same heart; they took different paths but reached the same destination. Scholars of later ages, not knowing the unity of the Dao’s embodiment or the essentials of virtue, seize upon the traces of accomplished deeds, kneel and sit to discourse upon them. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid confusion.\n\nEmbracing the Dao and holding to virtue, extending sincerity and delighting in giving—this is the Way of those above. Relieving the poor, aiding the distressed, generating profit, and eliminating harm—this is the Way of those in the middle. Seeking victory for oneself without contending for it—this is the Way of those below. Adapting to the times, understanding change and contingency, not bound by office or reclusion, differing in affairs yet sharing the same merit—such a one need not rely on bamboo, silk, metal, or stone to stand as a peer of the ancients.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can spiritually transform but cannot be spoken of. The sage governs all under Heaven without leaving his seat, his care more urgent than a cry for help. Thus, when words are the same, trust precedes them; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond them. When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit, for emotion precedes them. If he acts above but there is no response below, it is because emotion and command differ.\n\nA three-month-old infant knows not benefit or harm, yet a loving mother’s care for it grows ever deeper—this is emotion. Thus, the function of speech brings change, but the change is small; the function of silence brings change, and the change is great. Trusting a noble person’s words and being loyal to his intent, loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism. Is the ruler not the heart of Heaven and Earth? The heart is the dwelling of spirit and brightness; emotion stirs within, and words issue forth. If good, a response comes from a thousand *li* away; if not good, opposition arises from a thousand *li* away. Thus, when the sage is above, his transformation is like spirit—he governs all under Heaven without leaving his seat.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—this is not seeking fame by dying, but because a heart of affection is hidden within and does not shirk difficulty. The sorrow of the noble person is not for outward show but arises from within; it is also observed in his conduct. The sage is not ashamed before his shadow; the noble person is cautious in solitude. To abandon the near and seek the distant is to block the way.\n\nThus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance—such were the Two Emperors and Three Kings. When the sage is below, the people long for his intent—such were the mysterious sages and unadorned kings. The people do not forget their desire to benefit others. When a scholar faces danger and offers his life, or stands firm in great integrity and cannot be swayed, it is loyalty and filial piety that make it so.\n\nLike Chang Hong dying for his lord or Shen Sheng dying for his father, a heart of affection is hidden within and does not shirk difficulty—how could this be seeking fame by dying? When the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, they long for his intent.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior cries out, the three armies all retreat—this comes from the sincerity of his utterance. If one sings and none respond, or speaks and none bear it, there must be discord within. To govern all under Heaven without leaving one’s seat is to seek it within oneself. Thus, where persuasion does not reach, bearing does; where bearing does not reach, subtle influence does. Influence arises from the heart and takes form; the utmost essence can be met in form but cannot be awaited in expectation.\n\nWords issue from the mouth, actions arise from the heart—this is the movement of sincerity. Words come from near, actions extend afar—this is the response of sincerity. When a brave warrior cries out, does any in the three armies not retreat? It is the sincerity of his utterance. Like Sunzi’s teaching of warfare, courage arises from sincerity. When he beheaded the king’s beloved concubine, it was because the King of Wu’s words lacked sincerity, and disaster befell his subordinates. For those who hold a state, can their words and deeds not be sincere?\n\nLaozi said: Words have their source, affairs have their root. Losing their source and root, even with many skills, is not as good as speaking little. To harm the multitude, have the master craftsman cut off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced.",

When a state cherishes its benevolence and sincerity, extends its trustworthiness, punishes without resentment, and rewards without partiality, there is no need to display laws or set rewards, for the people will transform of their own accord.

His person transformed them.\n\nIf words are spoken but not practiced, the people will not follow.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the wise craftsman does not rely on skill but on timely closure—yet if he does not know when to close, he must bar the door before opening it. Loquacity and busyness are what the sage warns against. Only by honoring the Dao’s root and virtue’s foundation, teaching through action rather than words, can one avoid failure. Handling affairs with non-action ensures no harm. Those swept along by vulgar trends, though skilled in many arts, are enslaved by their own cleverness—how can they not injure their hands? The great craftsman’s work does not depend on cunning; thus, no bolt or bar can keep it shut. Yet one who bars the door before opening it—though the lock be sturdy—will have it sprung when thieves arrive. Where, then, lies the root and foundation?\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings, though pursued by different paths, converge in the same end. Survival and ruin, stability and collapse, are as one to him, for his resolve never wavers from benefiting others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the laments of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all convey sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy, weeping the expression of grief—what stirs within emerges without. It is the impulse that moves them. The sage’s heart, day and night, never forgets its desire to benefit others; the reach of his grace extends far indeed.\n\nThe sage is not without desire—he follows what benefits and thereby benefits; the sage is not without action—he acts when it is fitting to act. Different paths, same destination; survival and ruin as one. Diminishing oneself to profit others, never forgetting the world. Though lands differ and customs shift, though speech varies and winds change, human nature remains constant. What stirs within emerges without: joy finds voice in song, sorrow in tears, each response arising from its cause. All are our people—how can they be forgotten? Like the Duke of Zhou, who toiled day and night, sitting vigil until dawn, his resolve unwavering—his grace extended far.\n\nLaozi said: When man governs through non-action, to act is to harm the governance of non-action. To practice non-action is to act without acting; one who cannot act without acting cannot act at all. When man is silent, the spirit speaks—yet to force silence harms the spirit’s silence. To bear silence is to injure the spirit’s numinosity. The body has form; the spirit is formless. Form speaks; the formless is silent. Knowing the mutual arising of being and non-being, the formless does not harm being, nor does being harm the formless. Thus, the sage governs through non-action, neither body harming spirit nor spirit harming body. For wisdom is not numinous—it is what makes the numinous numinous. Thus, the two do not harm each other.\n\nWenzi said: Reputation can be forcibly established, merit forcibly achieved. Once, Nanrong Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Dao had perished in himself alone. He journeyed south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit awakened, his obstructions dissolved, and though he endured hardship for ten days without eating, it was as though he feasted on the finest meats. Thereby, his clarity illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages, his wisdom spanned heaven and earth, his discernment pierced the finest detail. His praises resounded in elegant speech, ceaseless even now—this is what it means to forcibly establish a name.\n\nThus, the farmer who does not strive will not fill his granary; the official who does not exert himself will not refine his sincerity; the general and minister who do not press forward will not accomplish great deeds; the king and lord who grow lax will leave no name to posterity.",

He acts in accord with the times, establishes merit through available resources, advances and retreats without difficulty, and penetrates all things without obstruction. Through persistent effort and resolute action, success is achieved as one—was Nanrong Zhao not also one who studied knowing the benefit of action?\n\nNanrong Chu felt shame that the sagely Way was absent within himself alone, so he entrusted his studies to the gate of Gengsang Chu. Later, he journeyed south to see Laozi and obtained the *Scripture of Nurturing Life*. His clarity illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages—thus, a name can be forcibly established, and merit can be forcibly accomplished.\n\nThe sage moves in concealment, acts in accord with the times, and establishes merit through available resources—how could advance and retreat pose any difficulty? The Perfected One refines sincerity within to manifest it outwardly, and his virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices yet does not forget harm; seeing harm, he is startled as if in mourning.\n\nHe who shares the people’s sorrows, the people will share his sorrows; he who delights in the people’s joy, the people will delight in his joy. Thus, to sorrow with the world and rejoice with the world—yet fail to become king—has never been known.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be attained. He abides in an unshakable position, accumulates in an inexhaustible storehouse, and bears his charge in an unfailing treasury. His decrees issue forth like the source of flowing water, guiding the people to offices free of contention and opening gates that must be entered.\n\nHe does not attempt what cannot be accomplished, does not seek what cannot be obtained, does not dwell where he cannot remain, and does not act where he cannot return. The great man enacts governance that brings delight, and none fail to follow his commands. When commands are followed, one progresses from the small to the great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm, and success becomes failure.\n\nThe Perfected One, the sage, and the great man should be distinguished. The Perfected One regards the people as himself, sharing in their benefit and harm. When the people rejoice, he rejoices; when the people sorrow, he sorrows—there has never been one who did not become king.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be attained; now it issues forth like a flowing stream. The great man enacts governance that brings delight, issuing commands in accord with the times. When commands align, the people follow; when they oppose, the people suffer harm.\n\nThe so-called great man is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—his inner strength like heaven and earth, his outer radiance like the sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all without exception; the sun and moon illuminate all without fail. The great man reveals goodness to others without altering his fundamental nature or changing his constant principles. The world obeys his commands as grass bends to the wind.\n\nWhen governance falters in spring, Jupiter’s movements expand or contract, no longer abiding in its proper course. When governance falters in summer, Mars retrogrades. When governance falters in autumn, Venus does not appear where it should, its rising and setting erratic. When governance falters in winter, Mercury fails to manifest in its proper region. When governance falters in all four seasons, Saturn sways and trembles, the sun and moon display omens, the five planets move in rebellion, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish; when summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season; when autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; when winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and security.\n\nHumans receive the numinous essence of heaven and earth, and the heart is the abode of spirit and illumination. The great man, however, possesses a spirit even more numinous than others. The slightest movement of his mind—whether toward good or evil—is mirrored by the celestial bell. Thus, the success or failure of governance manifests in portents and omens, responding to affairs without error.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* states: “To slight the spirits and oppress the people—August Heaven will not protect such.” Those who hold office—can they not be cautious?\n\n*Comprehensive Meaning of the* Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, *Scroll Two* (concluded)\n\n*Comprehensive Meaning of the* Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, *Scroll Three*\nCompiled by Du Daojian of Nangu Valley",

      "translated_text": "**The Nine Guardians**\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one, silent and limpid. The heavy and turbid became earth; the refined and subtle became heaven. They separated into the four seasons, divided into yin and yang. Pure qi formed humans; coarse qi formed creatures. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born.\n\nSpirit originates from heaven; bones and flesh are rooted in earth. When spirit enters its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? Thus, the sage models himself on heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, unenticed by others. He takes heaven as father, earth as mother, yin and yang as his warp, the four seasons as his weft. Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. All things that oppose them perish; those that accord with them live.\n\nThus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are where the Dao resides. Spirit is what one receives from heaven and earth; bones and flesh are what one is endowed with from earth.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony.\n\nThe One is the beginning of form; nine is the completion of numbers. Nine is the ultimate. The sage investigates the nine yet guards the One—then the Dao is within me. The One is the heart; the heart is heaven; heaven is man; man is things; things are the Dao; the Dao is I; I am the beginning. To know the ancient beginning—this is called the discipline of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Humans are born through the transformations of heaven and earth. In the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood and vessels form; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones harden; in the seventh, the body is complete; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera become distinct. The liver governs the eyes; the lungs govern the nose; the spleen governs the tongue; the kidneys govern the ears; the gallbladder governs the mouth. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, following heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth.\n\nHeaven has the four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder corresponds to clouds; the lungs to qi; the spleen to wind; the kidneys to rain; the liver to thunder. Humans resemble heaven and earth, and the heart governs them all. The ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon lose their course, they dim and eclipse; when wind and rain come unseasonably, they destroy and bring disaster. When the five stars lose their course, states and lands suffer calamity.\n\nThe beginning of things lies in the One, from which all arises. Through transformation, the myriad things are born. Father heaven and mother earth, yin and yang unite, conceiving and nurturing life. Impure qi forms creatures; pure qi forms humans. Thus, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all contained within my body.\n\nOpening and closing, giving and taking—such is the Way of heaven. To oppose it is to die; to follow it is to live. The Way of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still moderates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and illumination. How then can human ears and eyes endure constant stimulation without rest? How can spirit gallop without exhaustion? Thus, the sage guards the inner and does not lose the outer.\n\nBlood and qi are the glory of humans; the five viscera are their essence. When blood and qi concentrate within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, hearing and vision sharp—this is called illumination. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart, qi and intent prevail, conduct is upright, spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. Thus, one hears all, sees all, accomplishes all, and no misfortune or calamity can enter, nor can evil qi assail.\n\nTherefore, those who seek much gain little; those who see broadly know little. Heaven’s creation of things: what does not move grows like a plant; what moves crawls horizontally; what is planted stands upright. Humans combine the functions of both movement and stillness—thus they are more numinous than the myriad things. The four limbs, the hundred parts, spirit, blood, and qi—how can one not cherish them? How can one seek excessively?\n\nKings, dukes, and great officials, entrusted with the world, must also encompass humanity and all things, loving and nurturing them as they do their own bodies—only then is the Dao fulfilled. The orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Thus, when the ears and eyes indulge in sounds and sights, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not rest, spirit gallops and does not guard. Though fortune and misfortune come like mountains, one cannot recognize them.\n\nThus, the sage cherishes without excess. If the sage’s ears, eyes, and spirit are profoundly penetrating, unenticed by external allure, and if his intent and qi do not lose their clarity, with few desires, the five viscera are at peace. When spirit guards within and does not stray from the body, one can observe beyond past ages, within future affairs, and between fortune and misfortune—all becomes clearly visible. Therefore, the farther one strays, the less one knows. This is to say that spirit must not be allowed to indulge externally.\n\nThus, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, making them dull; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores; preferences and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Desires make human qi excessive; likes and dislikes exhaust human essence. If one does not swiftly cast them aside, intent and qi will daily diminish. Though the Yellow River is vast, wind and sun deplete it. Though spirit may be sovereign, worldly desires disturb it.",

      "translated_text": "Nothing escapes this diminishing. The sage, profoundly penetrating, is free from allure and longing. Spirit is firmly secured within, while the body remains at ease externally. The chamber of the heart is empty and void, and the numinous comes to dwell therein. Beyond past ages and before future affairs, nothing is not illuminated—all due to the heart’s emptiness.\n\nThe Way of nurturing life is no other than this: its method is like tending a horse—simply remove what harms it. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is their excessive indulgence in the pursuit of life. Only one who takes no thought for life thereby attains long life.\n\nHeaven and earth move in mutual resonance; the myriad things are gathered into one. To know the One is to know all things; to fail to know the One is to know nothing. I dwell in the world as but one thing among things—yet things are also things. How can one thing assess another?\n\nThe desire for life cannot be served; the aversion to death cannot be refused. To despise lowliness cannot be hated; to delight in honor cannot be rejoiced. Following one’s endowment and settling into stillness, daring not to go to extremes—daring not to go to extremes, one reaches the utmost joy.\n\nSome things arise without being made, sought, or nurtured—this is Heaven. Those that must be made, sought, and nurtured belong to man. If man errs by harboring the intent to make or seek, it is like forcing the sprouts to grow, only to bring harm, injuring life and losing nurture, failing to fulfill the natural lifespan.\n\nThe sage, resonant with Heaven and earth, is one with things. He does not augment life nor reject death; he scorns lowliness yet does not hate it, honors nobility yet does not rejoice. Following his endowment and settling into stillness, daring not to go to extremes, he reaches the utmost joy.\n\n**Guarding Emptiness**\nLaozi said: The so-called sage adapts to the times and rests content in his place, engaging with the world and delighting in his work. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; delight and anger are excesses of the Dao. In life, he moves with Heaven’s course; in death, he transforms with things. At rest, he harmonizes with yin’s power; in motion, he flows with yang’s current. Thus, the heart is the master of the body, and spirit is the heart’s treasure. If the body labors without rest, it withers; if essence is expended without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage follows this without daring to transgress.\n\nResponding to being with non-being, he exhausts its principles; receiving the full with the empty, he fathoms its limits. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, he fulfills his destiny. Neither distant nor close, he embraces virtue and kindles harmony, aligning with Heaven. He borders the Dao and neighbors virtue, neither initiating fortune nor preceding misfortune. Death and life bring no change to him—this is called utmost spirit. With spirit, one seeks and obtains all, accomplishes all. The sage empties himself to wander the world, moves with Heaven, and acts in accord with the times. Neither profit nor harm sways his heart; neither death nor life alters him. Receiving the full with the empty, he embraces virtue and kindles harmony. Misfortune does not precede him; fortune does not initiate with him. When affairs arise, he responds like an echo—divinely. When the response ceases, he is still. This is called guarding emptiness.\n\n**Guarding the Undivided**\nLaozi said: To regard the world as light is to keep spirit unburdened; to see the myriad things as minute is to keep the heart unconfused. To equalize life and death is to keep the will unafraid; to harmonize with change is to keep names from dazzling. The perfected man leans on an unshakable pillar, walks an unobstructed path, draws from an inexhaustible store, and learns from an undying teacher. Wherever he goes, he succeeds; wherever he turns, he penetrates. Whether bending or stretching, bowing or rising, he holds fast to destiny without confusion, turning through fortune and misfortune. Profit and harm cannot trouble his heart.\n\nOne who acts with righteousness may be pressed with benevolence but cannot be coerced with arms; he may be guided with righteousness but cannot be lured with profit. The noble man dies for righteousness—he cannot be detained by wealth or honor. He acts for righteousness and cannot be frightened by death—how much more so for one who practices non-action? One who practices non-action is without burden. The unburdened man takes the world as his shadow and pillar. Looking up to the ranks of the perfected, deeply probing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining the conduct of the vulgar below—this is truly shameful.\n\nOne who takes no thought for the world is like striking a drum to summon learning. Non-being gives rise to being, yet being is not without non-being. When being perishes, it returns to non-being. Being cannot exist without non-being; non-being is the root of being, yet being cannot sustain itself. To know the benefit of non-being and the use of being is to know that non-being is not nothingness—where nothingness is not nothing, there is the Dao. Being does not endure forever; what does not endure forever is a thing. Thus, the sage is rich without possessing, poor without lacking. Equalizing self and others, unifying life and death, he is not burdened in spirit. What does not perish in the self resides here—this is called guarding the undivided.\n\n**Guarding Equanimity**\nLaozi said: Esteem and wealth are what men covet, yet compared to the body, they are base. Therefore, the sage eats enough to fill the belly and replenish qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold. He satisfies his nature and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundance. His eyes do not gaze, his ears do not listen, his mouth does not speak, his heart does not scheme. He discards cleverness and returns to simplicity, rests his spirit, and abandons cunning. Without preferences or aversions, this is called great penetration.\n\nTo remove filth and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from the source. What could then not be accomplished? One who knows the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured by profit; one who unites inner and outer signs cannot be tempted by power. The outer limit of the outer is vast; the inner limit of the inner is most noble. To know the great and noble—where could one not succeed?\n\nThe Dao values guarding; with guarding, there is accomplishment. The heart values equanimity; with equanimity, there is no tilting. The world’s esteem and wealth are what all men covet. Covetousness gives rise to an unbalanced heart—this is not the Way of guarding. Thus, the sage eats to fill his belly, wears enough to cover his body, and harbors no greed for excess accumulation.",
      "overlap_context": "hus, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, making them dull; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores; preferences and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Desires make human qi excessive; likes and dislikes exhaust human essence. If one does not swiftly cast them aside, intent and qi will daily diminish. Though the Yellow River is vast, wind and sun deplete it. Though spirit may be sovereign, worldly desires disturb it.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, with a heart at peace and qi settled, the spirit does not stray outward—this accords with the great constancy of the Dao and is called \"guarding equilibrium.\"\n\n**Guarding the Easy (4)**\nLaozi said: Those of old who embodied the Dao ordered their emotions and nature, cultivated their heart’s arts, nurtured them with harmony, and maintained them with moderation. They delighted in the Dao and forgot lowliness; their inner power was secure, and they forgot poverty. If nature has no desires, there is nothing unattainable through desirelessness; if the heart has no joys, there is nothing unachievable through joylessness. What harms nature is not allowed to burden virtue; what disrupts life is not permitted to disturb harmony. They did not indulge the body or follow whim, yet their institutions could serve as models for the world. They ate according to their stomach’s measure, clothed themselves according to their form’s needs, dwelled where their body fit, and acted according to their nature’s inclination. They left the world’s surplus without claiming it and entrusted the myriad things without seeking profit—how could poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness cause them to lose their nature and life? Those who do so may be said to have embodied the Dao.\n\n\"Much ease brings many difficulties\"—this speaks of affairs. But in terms of the Dao, it is not so. Those of old who embodied the Dao cultivated their heart and nature, made their bodies at ease before acting, settled their intentions before moving, delighted in the Dao and rested in constancy, and did not attempt what was difficult or extraordinary. Thus, their institutions had laws, their bearing was observable, and they acted with composure—this is called \"guarding the easy.\"\n\n**Guarding Purity (5)**\nLaozi said: Humans receive qi from Heaven, and their ears and eyes respond to sounds and sights, their nose and mouth to fragrances and odors, their hungry skin to cold and warmth—all share the same nature. Yet some die, some live; some become noble, some base. The difference lies in how they are governed.\n\nThe spirit is the wellspring of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is at peace. No one mirrors themselves in flowing water but in still water, for it is clear and tranquil. Thus, when the spirit is clear and the intent is calm, one can perceive the true nature of things. Those who employ this must borrow from non-employment. A bright mirror is not sullied by dust and grime; a clear spirit is not misled by cravings. Wherever the heart reaches, the spirit is luminously present; returning to emptiness, agitation dissipates and rest is stored—this is the wandering of the sage.\n\nThus, those who govern the world must first comprehend the nature of life and destiny. Water is clear and mirrors things; the spirit is clear and perceives the Dao. Humans receive qi from Heaven in the same way, so why should my perception of the Dao in the heart be uniquely different? Because the heart is clear. The sage’s heart is bright as still water: when things come, they are seen; when they depart, it returns to stillness—how could anything linger in my heart? A clear mirror is unperturbed—this is called \"guarding purity.\"\n\n**Guarding Authenticity (6)**\nLaozi said: The so-called sage simply accords with nature: eating according to the stomach’s measure, clothing according to the body’s form, restraining the self so that greedy and corrupt thoughts have no way to arise. Thus, those who can possess the world must not treat the world as their possession; those who can attain fame and reputation must not seek it through transgressive conduct. Truly comprehending the nature of life and destiny, benevolence and righteousness naturally adhere.\n\nIf the spirit is unobscured and the heart unburdened, all is penetrating and unimpeded, serene and untroubled—power and profit cannot lure, sounds and sights cannot seduce, eloquence cannot persuade, cunning cannot move, and bravery cannot frighten. This is the wandering of the true person. Those who give life do not live; those who transform do not change. Those who do not grasp this Dao, though their wisdom governs heaven and earth, their brilliance illuminates the sun and moon, their eloquence unravels linked rings, and their words moisten metal and stone, are still of no benefit in governing the world. Thus, the sage does not lose what they guard.\n\nThe sage follows nature, guards utmost authenticity, aligns with the times, and understands the hearts of the people. Only by not opposing the nature of the myriad things can the heart congeal and the form dissolve, becoming pure and unceasing—this is called \"guarding authenticity.\"\n\n**Guarding Stillness (7)**\nLaozi said: Stillness, silence, tranquility, and simplicity nurture life; harmony, joy, emptiness, and nothingness uphold virtue. When the outer does not disturb the inner, nature attains its proper place; when stillness is unmoving and harmony is settled, virtue rests in its position. Nurturing life to order the world and embracing virtue to live out one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.\n\nThose who do so have unobstructed blood and qi, no stagnant qi in the five viscera, and are neither warped by fortune nor sullied by fame or blame. Without possessing the world, who could aid them? Having talent but not meeting the times, one cannot even free oneself—how much less without the Dao?\n\nThose who see the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; those who tune their ears to the sounds of gold and jade cannot see the shape of Mount Tai. Thus, a small focus causes one to forget the great. Now, when the myriad things come, they snatch at our nature and seize our essence like a spring’s source—though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?\n\nIf a basin of water is clear, one can see their eyebrows after a day; if it is muddied by a single stir, one cannot discern its shape. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy, like a basin of water. The Dao of heaven and earth is still, so things grow without being forced; the sage’s governance is still, so the people are naturally capable. If one harbors a mind to seek merit and stir up affairs, disturbing nature and disordering heaven’s constancy, stillness is lost and movement is confused.\n\nOnly by not pursuing strange changes is this called \"guarding stillness.\"\n\n**Guarding the Law (8)**\nLaozi said: The highest sage models Heaven; the next esteems worthies; the lowest employs ministers. Employing ministers is the path to peril and ruin; esteeming worthies is the source of delusion and confusion; modeling Heaven is the Dao of governing heaven and earth.\n\nEmptiness and stillness are the foundation: emptiness receives all, stillness sustains all. Knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness, one can endure from beginning to end. Thus, the sage takes stillness as governance and movement as disorder. Therefore it is said: Do not disturb or agitate, and the myriad things will clarify themselves; do not startle or alarm, and the myriad things will order themselves—this is the Dao of Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "The highest sage models Heaven, and the hundred bones are ordered, the myriad transformations at peace. The next esteems worthies, and the law proceeds from the self—this is the source of delusion. The lowest employs ministers, and the law emerges from the mouths of the many—this is the omen of peril and ruin. Cultivating the self without the Dao is to be deluded in affairs and lose one’s spirit; governing the state without the Dao is to disorder policy and harm the people. Only taking the embodiment of the Dao as the foundation is this called \"guarding the Law.\"\n\n**Guarding Weakness (9)**\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world or the state as their household, regard the myriad things as their livestock, embrace the vastness of all under Heaven, and possess the abundance of the ten thousand things. Yet when their qi is replete and their ambitions arrogant, the great use troops to invade the small, the small grow insolent and overbear their superiors, and their hearts indulge in extravagance and excess—this is like whirlwinds and violent rains, which cannot endure for long. Therefore the sage governs with the Dao, holds to the One and practices non-action, without harming the primal qi. Perceiving the small and guarding softness, withdrawing and possessing nothing, modeling the rivers and seas, the rivers and seas do not act—thus merit and fame transform themselves. Not forcing, one can complete one’s kingship; acting as the female of all under Heaven, one’s spirit does not die. Self-cherishing completes one’s nobility. With the power of ten thousand chariots and the ten thousand things as one’s merit and fame, the burden of authority is most weighty—one cannot treat oneself lightly. Treating oneself lightly, merit and fame will not be achieved.\n\nThe Dao is great yet accomplished through the small, abundant yet ruled by the few. Thus the sage governs all under Heaven with the Dao. That which is soft, weak, subtle, and mysterious perceives the small; that which is frugal, sparing, diminished, and deficient perceives the few. Perceiving the small, one can complete the great; perceiving the few, one can complete the beautiful. Weakness is the function of the Dao, not cowardice—it is but guarding the harmonious and balanced. The Son of Heaven takes all under Heaven as his household; the feudal lords take their states as their households. Regarding the people as oneself, not relying on power and position to assert strength, not using arms to oppress the multitude—if distant peoples do not submit, then cultivate civil virtue to attract them. Great resources complete the small and become abundant; supporting the few as the foundation, advancing without harm, one attains peace and tranquility—this is called \"guarding weakness.\"\n\nThe Way of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low, diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency. The rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus all under Heaven returns to and serves them. Therefore the sage, humble, modest, pure, and yielding, perceives lowness; emptying the heart of all, perceives insufficiency. Perceiving lowness, one can attain loftiness; perceiving insufficiency, one can complete one’s worthiness. Those who are haughty do not stand; those who are extravagant do not endure; the strong and overbearing perish; the overflowing and full are ruined. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last the day; small valleys cannot remain full for even a moment. Whirlwinds and torrential rains carry the qi of strength and overbearing, thus they cannot last and perish; small valleys occupy the place of strength and overbearing, thus they cannot but be seized.\n\nTherefore the sage holds to the female and the yielding, abandons arrogance and extravagance, and dares not act with the qi of strength and overbearing. Holding to the female and the yielding, one can establish one’s maleness and virility; not daring arrogance and extravagance, one can endure long. The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency, detests fullness and favors modesty. Those who rely on force become hegemons; those who rely on virtue become kings. The weak overcomes the strong.\n\nWhen people impose harsh governance and oppress the people, it is like Heaven’s violent winds breaking trees—primordial qi vents its wrath, and strength cannot endure long. Thus the sage is humble and lowly, guarding only weakness.\n\nLaozi said: The Way of Heaven reaches its extreme and then reverses; when full, it diminishes—this is seen in the sun and moon. Therefore the sage daily diminishes, and the primal qi does not dare become full; daily advancing with the female, his merit and power do not decline—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nHuman nature and emotions all favor the high and detest the low, favor gain and detest loss, favor profit and detest harm, favor honor and detest humility, favor nobility and detest baseness. The multitude acts accordingly, thus cannot succeed; clinging to these, thus cannot attain. Therefore the sage models Heaven: not acting yet accomplishing, not grasping yet attaining. Sharing human emotions yet following a different path, he can endure long.\n\nThus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called the *yòuzhī*. When empty, it stands upright; when full, it overturns. Things flourish and then decline; the sun at its zenith moves on; the moon at its full wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Therefore, those with keen hearing and broad wisdom guard with foolishness; those with extensive learning and eloquence guard with restraint; those with martial strength and courage guard with awe; those with wealth and vastness guard with narrowness; those whose virtue extends to all under Heaven guard with yielding. These five are how the former kings guarded all under Heaven. Those who follow this Dao do not desire fullness, thus can wear out without renewal.\n\nThe Dao reaches its extreme and then reverses; things flourish and then decline—this is the constant principle. The *zhī* vessel full then overturns; the blade hard then snaps—this is the constant of things. If one can observe the constant principles of things and not rely on power to oppress the multitude and assert strength, then one avoids the harm of stumbling and falling. Preserving softness and weakness, one can endure long.\n\nLaozi said: The sage closes with yin and opens with yang, able to reach the state of no joy—thus there is nothing not joyful. Being without anything not joyful is to reach ultimate joy. Therefore, inner joy is external, not external joy within. Thus there is self-joy, and having this attainment, one is honored throughout all under Heaven. The reason for this is taking all under Heaven as the essential for all under Heaven, not residing in that, but in the self; not in others, but in one’s own person. When the person attains, the ten thousand things are complete.\n\nThus one who has mastered the discourse on the arts of the heart is external to desires, likes, and aversions. Therefore, there is nothing to delight in, nothing to anger, nothing to rejoice in, nothing to suffer. The myriad things are profoundly united, without right or wrong. Thus the scholar has a constant discourse; the woman has unchanging conduct. Not relying on power to be honored, not needing wealth to be rich, not requiring force to be strong, not valuing goods and wealth, not coveting worldly fame, not taking nobility as security, not taking baseness as peril—form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place.\n\nWhen Heaven is about to rain, the pillars’ bases first moisten...",

      "translated_text": "When spring is near, the ice thaws first; when a man is about to die, his tongue stiffens first—qi effects this. The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death. Those who are violent and unyielding yet do not meet their end are the most extreme of the violent and unyielding. Only when qi and form are harmonious and weak, merging with things in profound unity and growing together without harm, does one approach the Way.\n\nThe form is the dwelling of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the regulator of life. If any one of these loses its proper place, all three are injured. Thus, when spirit presides, form follows and benefits; when form presides, spirit follows and suffers. The greedy and covetous, blinded by power and profit, lured by fame and rank, strive with excessive cunning to rise above others in the world. Their essence and spirit daily wane and drift far away; long immersed and unable to return, their form becomes closed and resistant, leaving no path for entry. Thus they often suffer blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nEssence, spirit, will, and qi—when still, they daily grow and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Therefore, the sage nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and softens their qi, levels their form, and drifts with the Dao. In this way, the transformations of the myriad things all find their counterpart, and the changes of a hundred affairs all meet their response.\n\nSpirit depends on form to live; essence depends on qi to flourish. Nurturing one another without losing harmony—this is the essence of cultivating life. But those who are empty and arrogant, relying on qi to contend with things, will deplete their essence and exhaust their spirit, often suffering blindness and forgetfulness—signs of approaching death.\n\nThus the sage weakens their form, harmonizes their qi, and conceals their spirit, attaining the Way of the Nine Guardians. Does the sage deceive us? To aspire to sagehood is to become a sage; to aspire to worthiness is to become worthy.\n\nIn guarding simplicity, Laozi said: The so-called True Person is one whose nature aligns with the Dao. Thus, they have yet seem without; are full yet seem empty. They govern their inner self, not their outer self, clarifying the Great Simplicity. They act without contrivance and return to simplicity, embracing their origin and holding fast to spirit, roaming the root of Heaven and Earth. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action, they carry no schemes or cunning in their hearts. Discerning the unborrowed, they do not shift with things. Perceiving the transformations of affairs, they hold to their source. Their mind and intent focus inward, comprehending fortune and misfortune as one. Abiding without knowing what they do, moving without knowing where they go, they know without learning, see without looking, accomplish without acting, and distinguish without governing.\n\nThey respond to stimuli, move under compulsion, and go when there is no choice—like light fearing darkness, like a shadow following form. Following the Dao as their guide, they act when conditions are met. Vast and empty, clear and still, they take the thousand lives as one transformation, the ten thousand differences as one source. They possess essence yet do not employ it; possess spirit yet do not use it. They guard the simplicity of the Great Undifferentiated, standing at the center of utmost purity. Their sleep is dreamless, their wisdom unaroused. In movement, they leave no form; in stillness, no substance. Existing yet seeming absent, living yet seeming dead, they enter and exit without gap, commanding ghosts and spirits.\n\nThis is how essence and spirit ascend to the Dao: by ensuring their free flow without losing their origin, day and night without interruption, harmonizing with things like spring. This is to unite and give birth to the seasons within the heart. Thus, though the form may decay, the spirit never transforms. Responding to change without changing, through a thousand shifts and ten thousand turns, it remains without limit. The changing return to formlessness; the unchanging are born with Heaven and Earth. Therefore, that which gives life has never truly lived; what it gives life to is but life’s transformation. The transforming has never truly transformed; what it transforms is but transformation.\n\nThis is the wandering of the True Person, the pure Dao. The True Person guards the simplicity of the Great Undifferentiated, roams the root of Heaven and Earth, and merges with the Great Thoroughfare—vast and without trace. Only by not possessing a self do they not lack things. They laugh when others laugh, weep when others weep, yet through a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they never reach an end. The changing return to formlessness, yet there is change without change. The unchanging are born with Heaven and Earth, yet there is life without life.\n\nThe Nine Guardians of before and the guarding of simplicity that follows—these are one becoming nine, and ten returning to one. This is called roaming with the Creator. *The Thoroughly Illuminated True Classic, with Collected Explanations, Scroll Three* ends here.",

      "translated_text": "**Scroll Four of *The Thoroughly Illuminated True Classic, with Collected Explanations*\nCompiled by Nan’guzi Du Daojian**\n\n**The Chapter of Tally-Words**\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. Level as the water-level, straight as the marking-line, round as the compass, square as the carpenter’s square. It enfolds Heaven and Earth yet has no inside or outside; it penetrates and covers all yet encounters no obstruction. Thus, one who embodies the Dao is neither angered nor delighted. Seated, they are without care; asleep, they dream not. They name things as they appear and respond to affairs as they arise.\n\nTallies manifest trust; words convey sincerity. The world speaks of tally-mandates, tally-seals, golden tallies, and jade tallies—all serve to manifest trust and convey sincerity, so that this evokes and that responds. Hence, they are called *tally-words*.\n\nThe Dao is without limit in height or depth, connecting far and near. It is formless and nameless, yet possesses sentiment and trust.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao, harboring no private joy or anger. They name things as they appear and respond to affairs as they arise. Unspoken words may yet serve as tally and trust.\n\nLaozi said: Those who covet fame must create affairs. Once affairs arise, they abandon the public and pursue the private, forsake the Dao and rely on themselves. They perform good deeds for praise and establish virtue for renown. Thus, governance does not follow principle, and affairs do not accord with the times. Governance that does not follow principle invites much blame; affairs that do not accord with the times yield no merit. Acting recklessly to meet expectations, success cannot absolve their blame, while failure is enough to destroy them. Fame is the instrument of self-destruction—what the sage guards against.\n\nThose who covet fame must violate Heaven and defy the Dao, abandon the public and pursue the private, seek praise and establish renown, creating affairs to harm the multitude. Thus, governance does not follow principle, merit cannot outweigh blame, affairs fail and destroy the self—this is no falsehood.\n\nLaozi said: Be not the corpse of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of cunning. Conceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Be not the first to seek fortune, nor the initiator of misfortune. Begin in formlessness, move only when unavoidable. Desire fortune? First distance misfortune. Desire benefit? First avoid harm.\n\nThus, those who act yet seek tranquility—if they lose their tranquility, they court danger. Those who govern—if they lose their governance, they invite chaos. Therefore, desire not to be as jade, restless and polished; nor as stone, solitary and unyielding.\n\nThe finer the grain, the sooner the skin is flayed; the finer the antlers, the sooner the body is slain. Sweet springs must run dry; straight trees must be felled. Florid words later become transgressions; jade within stone harms the mountain. The calamities of the black-headed people surely precede their words.\n\nThe retribution of good and evil follows like shadow after form. Good deeds summon blessings; evil deeds summon misfortune. Evil must not be done—how then can fame be coveted?\n\nThose who seek tranquility—if tranquility is lost, danger follows. Those who seek governance—if governance is lost, chaos ensues. Fine grain invites flaying; fine antlers invite slaughter. Never has harm come that was not self-invited.\n\nLaozi said: When the times move, act in accord. Those who do not know the Dao mistake fortune for misfortune. Heaven is the canopy; Earth, the carriage-pole. Those who skillfully employ the Dao never meet their end. Earth is the carriage-wheel; Heaven, the canopy. Those who skillfully employ the Dao never suffer harm.\n\nWhen the five phases are arrayed, there must be conquest. All beneath Heaven’s cover is fitting. Thus, to know yet claim ignorance is sickness; to be ignorant yet claim knowledge is also sickness.\n\nHeaven as canopy covers all; Earth as carriage bears all. Heaven and Earth’s grace toward humanity is boundlessly great. The sage emulates this: acting in accord with the times, every movement follows. Like the five phases, they mutually generate and mutually conquer.\n\nThose who skillfully employ the Dao know without speaking of knowledge—this is superior. To be ignorant yet speak of knowledge is sickness.\n\nLaozi said: Mountains give birth to metal; stone gives birth to jade. They turn and flay one another. Trees give birth to insects, which return to devour them. Humans create affairs, which return to harm them.\n\nThose who love affairs are never without misfortune; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Skilled swimmers drown; skilled riders fall. Each suffers calamity through what they love.\n\nSuccess lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth abides below and does not contend for height—thus it is secure and never imperiled. Water flows downward and does not contend for speed—thus it departs yet is never late.\n\nTherefore, the sage, being without attachment, suffers no loss; being without action, meets no defeat. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things mutually steal to nourish one another. When theft is fitting, there is peace; when theft is unfitting, there is harm.\n\nThus, food can nourish humans, yet also harm them. The people can support their lord, yet also rebel against him. When scholars establish laws and initiate affairs to exploit the people’s strength, it may seem beneficial at first, but in the end, none do not harm themselves.\n\nKnow that success lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity—then there will be no loss from mutual theft.\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot be exhausted; two words are the ancestral teaching of the world. Three words make the lords of states mighty; four words make the world balanced.\n\nIntegrity and trust cannot be exhausted. Virtue and the Dao are the world’s ancestral teaching. Exalting the worthy and virtuous makes the lords of states mighty. Loathing the few and loving the many makes the world balanced.\n\nFew faults in speech, few regrets in conduct—this lies in action, not in words. Holding the great image, the world comes to you—this lies in virtue, not in peril.\n\nThe mouth alone gives rise to good and incites strife—how can words not be cautious?\n\nLaozi said: Humans face three deaths, none of which are fated. Immoderate eating and drinking, despising and degrading the body—illness kills them together. Insatiable in pleasure, unceasing in desire—punishment kills them together.",

praise and blame come from others.\nThus, praise does not spur you to greater effort,\nNor does criticism deter you.\nYou dwell in quietude and take joy,\nGovernance is not a burden to you.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao is to hold fast to what you already possess,\nNot to seek what you do not yet have.\nTo seek what you do not yet have is to lose what you already possess;\nTo follow what you already possess is to attain what you desire.\n\nGovernance not yet secured against disorder will inevitably falter;\nActions not yet free of fault will inevitably meet setback.\nThus, no greater fortune than avoiding misfortune,\nNo greater benefit than avoiding loss.\n\nThe Dao cannot be pursued to gain advantage,\nBut it can bring tranquility and avert harm.\nThus, one may always avoid misfortune but not always attain fortune,\nAlways avoid guilt but not always earn merit.\n\nThe Dao is vast and obscure,\nFollowing Heaven’s might,\nAligning with Heaven’s qi,\nWithout scheming or planning,\nWithout storing or hoarding.\nTo welcome without inviting,\nTo send without bidding farewell—\nThough people move east, west, south, or north,\nThey stand firm at the center.\nThus, amid crookedness, you remain straight,\nFlowing with the world yet never straying from your path.\nYou neither seek goodness nor shun ugliness,\nFollowing Heaven’s Way without initiation,\nWithout self-aggrandizement,\nFollowing Heaven’s principle without premeditation,\nWithout neglecting the times,\nAligning with Heaven’s timing,\nWithout seeking gain,\nWithout rejecting fortune,\nConforming to Heaven’s decree.\n\nWithin, no extraordinary fortune;\nWithout, no extraordinary misfortune.\nThus, misfortune and fortune do not arise,\nAnd who would dare harm others?\n\nTherefore, supreme virtue speaks of shared paths,\nActs in shared fortune,\nUnites hearts above and below,\nWith no divergent ways.\nThose with peripheral visions are dismissed from error,\nThe path to goodness is opened,\nAnd the people turn toward rectitude.\n\nGreed for gain and forgetfulness of loss—\nA common affliction among all.\nWithout desire, there is tranquility—\nThis is called the Perfect Person.\n\nIn the world, there are things that cannot be guaranteed.\nTo hold fast to what you possess may bring what you lack;\nTo seek what you lack may lose what you possess.\nThus, those who follow the Dao\nHave no extraordinary fortune within,\nNo extraordinary misfortune without,\nAnd align with Heaven—\nWho could harm them?\n\nLaozi said:\nTo do good is to encourage,\nTo do evil is to invite observation.\nEncouragement brings nobility,\nObservation brings calamity.\nThus, the Dao cannot be pursued to seek fame,\nBut it can be cultivated in retreat to refine oneself.\n\nTherefore, the sage does not seek fame through action,\nNor reputation through knowledge.\nGovernance follows naturally,\nAnd the self remains unburdened.\n\nWhat is done may fail,\nWhat is sought may not be attained,\nAnd people may falter while the Dao remains unobstructed.\n\nTo have wisdom yet do nothing is the same as having no wisdom;\nTo have ability yet act not is the same as having no ability.\nTo have wisdom as though without wisdom,\nTo have ability as though without ability—\nWhen the Dao is fully understood, human talent is extinguished.\n\nHuman understanding and the Dao cannot both flourish;\nIf people love fame, they will not use the Dao.\nWhen the Dao surpasses humanity, fame fades,\nAnd when fame flourishes, the Dao is obscured—\nThen peril and ruin follow.\n\nTo do good without seeking fortune yet fortune comes,\nTo do evil without inviting misfortune yet misfortune arises.\nTo leave a stench for ten thousand generations,\nOr a fragrant name for a thousand years—\nThe difference is clear.\n\nThus, if one values fame excessively,\nThe mind will not adhere to the Dao;\nIf one delves deeply into the Dao,\nThe body will not seek fame.\nThis is the distinction between Heaven and humanity.\n\nLaozi said:\nTo let honest men divide wealth is not as fair as\nSetting fixed portions and casting lots—\nFor those with intent in division\nAre not as impartial as those without intent.\n\nTo let virtuous men guard wealth is not as secure as\nSealing the doors and keeping it sealed—\nFor those with desire in guarding\nAre not as tranquil as those without desire.\n\nWhen others point out your flaws, resentment arises;\nWhen overseers see your ugliness, you mend your ways.\nIf one can interact with others without entangling oneself,\nThey are free from burdens.\n\nTo divide wealth by casting lots,\nIntent is less fair than disinterest;\nTo guard wealth by sealing doors,\nDesire is less secure than contentment.",

flaws is self-deception.\nOnly those who interact with others without entangling themselves in their affairs\nHave no such faults, and others find none in them.\n\nLaozi said:\nWhen dealing with others,\nIf one does not offer treasures or wealth,\nThey will use humble words,\nYet their greed will never be sated.\nWith a humble demeanor, they avoid flattery,\nAnd their discussions and dealings remain uncorrupted.\n\nTo bind with oaths and alliances,\nYet break them before the appointed day—\nThis is why the virtuous do not outwardly display benevolence and righteousness\nWhile inwardly cultivating virtue and moral power.\nThey govern their own lands,\nExpand their territories,\nEncourage the people to defend their lives,\nStrengthen their walls and fortresses,\nAnd unite the people in heart,\nSo that together they may guard the ancestral altars and the state.\nThus, they do not punish the innocent,\nNor exploit the scarce for private gain—\nThis is the Dao of preserving completeness,\nThe principle of ensuring benefit.\n\nTo deal with others by offering treasures and wealth,\nTheir greed will never be sated.\nTo bind with humble words,\nTheir agreements will falter before the appointed day.\n\nOnly when one inwardly cultivates virtue and moral power,\nAnd unites the people in heart,\nCan they guard the ancestral altars and the state,\nAnd protect the people.\nThen their Dao is complete.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Sage does not conquer their own heart,\nWhile the common people cannot conquer their desires.\nThe virtuous follow the upright *qi*,\nThe petty follow the perverse *qi*.\nWhat aligns with nature within,\nAnd conforms to righteousness without,\nMoving according to principle without clashing with things—\nThis is the upright *qi*.\nWhat indulges in flavors and luxuries,\nRevels in sound and color,\nActs on whims and anger,\nWithout regard for future consequences—\nThis is the perverse *qi*.\nThe perverse and the upright harm each other,\nDesire and nature conflict,\nThey cannot coexist—\nOne flourishes while the other declines.\nThus, the Sage diminishes desire to follow nature.\n\nThe eyes love color,\nThe ears love sound,\nThe nose loves fragrance,\nThe mouth loves flavor—\nWhen all are indulged,\nThey cannot escape the harm of craving and desire.\nThe ears, eyes, nose, and mouth,\nIf they do not know what to desire,\nAre governed by the heart,\nEach finding its proper place.\nFrom this, it is clear that desire cannot be conquered.\n\nThe Dao-heart and the human-heart,\nThe distinction between Heaven’s principle and human desire.\nWhen principle prevails,\nAll actions are Heavenly.\nWhen desire prevails,\nAll actions are human—\nThis is the distinction between the virtuous and the petty.\n\nPrinciple and desire conquer each other,\nThe perverse and the upright harm each other—\nThe virtuous do not indulge in such,\nHow much less would the Sage?\n\nLaozi said:\nTo cultivate the body and nurture nature,\nOne must regulate sleep and rest,\nModerate food and drink,\nHarmonize joy and anger,\nBalance movement and stillness.\nWhat is gained within,\nThe perverse *qi* cannot enter.\n\nTo adorn the exterior while harming the interior,\nTo indulge emotions while damaging the spirit—\nThose who see only outward appearances\nAre blind to their true nature.\nHe who forgets his virtue for even a moment\nWill be constrained in his nature,\nHe who forgets his true nature within a hundred paces\nWill burden his form.\nThus, those with beautiful feathers\nAre wounded in their bones,\nThose with lush branches\nAre harmed at their roots.\nNone in the world can possess both beauties.\nThe true Dao nurtures the spirit,\nThe human Dao nurtures the form.\nWhat is gained within is lasting,\nWhat is gained without is fleeting.\nTo distance oneself from sound and color,\nTo moderate flavors and tastes—\nThis is the human Dao of nurturing the form.\nTo sever thought and contemplation,\nTo preserve the vital *qi*—\nThis is the true Dao of nurturing the spirit.\nTo cultivate the body and nurture nature,\nIs to gain both within and without—\nHow can one seek this through appearance, voice, or countenance?\n\nLaozi said:\nHeaven has its light,\nYet it does not fear the people’s darkness.\nEarth has its wealth,\nYet it does not fear the people’s poverty.\nThe truly Daoist, like a mountain,\nRemain unmoved and steady.\nThe traveler takes them as a guide,\nStraightforward yet sufficient in their offerings,\nNot seeking to bestow,\nNor receiving gratitude in return.\nThus, they are tranquil and endure.\nHeaven and Earth have no part in it,\nSo nothing is taken from them—\nNo virtue is claimed,\nSo no resentment arises.\nThose who are skilled at anger\nWill invite many grievances,\nThose who are skilled at giving\nWill invite many takings—\nOnly by following Heaven and Earth’s natural course\nCan one conquer principle.\nThus, praise leads to blame,\nGoodness leads to evil,\nHarm begins with benefit,\nCalamity follows fortune—\nTo not seek benefit is to avoid harm,\nTo not seek fortune is to avoid calamity.\nPreserving completeness is the norm for the body,\nWealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.\n\nThe Sage illuminates the land,\nYet the people do not grow dim,\nThe Sage stores riches in the world,\nYet the people do not grow poor.\nTo follow Heaven and Earth’s natural course,\nTo allow all things to grow of their own accord—\nNot to hoard for oneself,\nThus no need for public seizure,\nNot to bestow lightly,\nThus no need for harsh punishment.\nTo regard wealth and honor as passing clouds,\nIs to preserve one’s true nature.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Sage wears no extravagant garments,\nNor practices deceptive conduct.\nTheir clothing is simple,\nTheir actions unobserved,\nTheir way is open yet not ostentatious,\nTheir poverty is unshaken,\nTheir honor is not flaunted,\nTheir obscurity is not humiliating,\nTheir strangeness is not bizarre—\nTheir use is the same as all others,\nYet cannot be named—\nThis is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).\n\nPlain yet hidden,\nStrange yet not bizarre—\nThe virtuous do not indulge in such.\n\nExtravagant garments,\nDeceptive conduct—\nHow could these be the Sage’s affairs?\nTheir brilliance does not dazzle,\nTheir integrity is not ostentatious—\nThey simply share in the people’s common use.\nThis is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Daoist lives straightforward,\nWaiting for their fate.\nWhen time arrives,\nIt cannot be hastened or repelled.\nWhen time departs,\nIt cannot be pursued or retained.\nThus, the Sage does not advance to seek,\nNor retreat to yield.\nThree years of following time,\nTime departs and they move on.\nThree years of waiting for time,\nTime comes after them—\nNeither departing nor arriving,\nThey remain steadfast in their place.\n\nHeaven’s Dao knows no favoritism,\nOnly virtue is bestowed.\nWhen fortune comes,\nIt is not sought by oneself,\nSo they do not claim its merit.\nWhen calamity arrives,\nIt is not generated by oneself,\nSo they do not regret their actions.\nTheir center is serene,\nNot burdened by virtue,\nThe barking of dogs does not startle them,\nThey trust their own nature—\nTheir sincerity knows no division.\n\nThus, those who understand the Dao are not perplexed,\nThose who know fate are not anxious.\nWhen the Emperor dies,\nTheir remains are buried in the wild,\nYet their spirit is enshrined in the Bright Hall,\nFor the spirit is nobler than the form.\nThus, if the spirit governs the form,\nThey prosper.\nIf the form conquers the spirit,\nThey decline.\nThough cleverness may be employed,\nIt must ultimately return to the spirit—\nThis is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).」",

serene.\n\nMeasuring life by years,\nThey fretted over the world’s chaos,\nAs one might fear the drying of the Yellow River,\nWeeping to nourish it instead.\nThus, those who do not fret over the world’s chaos\nBut rejoice in their own order,\nMay be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nThe Dao reveres virtue and values power,\nGiving delight to all hearts and preserving all within.\nThus, it does not stir their mind with poverty or lowliness,\nFor when their own nature is ordered,\nThe world’s turmoil is no longer a cause for worry.\nWould they then burden themselves with concerns\nFor a life not even a hundred years long?\nLaozi says: There are three sources of resentment in people—\nThose with high rank are envied by others,\nThose with great office are distrusted by their lord,\nThose with abundant wealth are resented by the people.\n\nThe higher the rank, the lower the intent,\nThe greater the office, the smaller the heart,\nThe richer the wealth, the broader the giving.\nCultivating these three,\nResentment does not arise.\n\nThus, nobility finds its root in humility,\nElevation in submission as its foundation.\nHigh rank breeds arrogance,\nOthers will envy it.\nGreat office fosters pride,\nThe lord will distrust it.\nAbundant wealth without generosity,\nOthers will resent it.\nThis is the Dao of *mutual undermining*—\n\nOnly through humility and generosity,\nWithout forgetting lowliness or submission,\nIs resentment avoided.\n\nLaozi says: Speech is the means by which one conveys their own nature to others,\nHearing is the means by which others convey their nature to oneself.\nIf one is both deaf and blind,\nThe Dao cannot pass through them.\nThus, those afflicted with deafness and blindness,\nDo not know how to convey or receive the Dao—\nAnd is it only the body that can be deaf and blind?\nThe heart too can be sealed,\nUnknowing how to convey or receive.\nThis is the kind of deafness and blindness.\n\nThe Dao as the ultimate principle,\nAll things with form arise from it—\nAs its kin, they are also close to it.\nThose who nourish on grains and *qi*,\nAll attain longevity—\nAs its ruler, they are also blessed.\nAll who are wise learn from it—\nAs its teacher, they are also enlightened.\n\nMost people harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless,\nThus they know not enough and their days are insufficient.\nThey seek the Dao in the midst of games of chance,\nTheir knowledge and insight deepen.\nWithout hearing or inquiry,\nThey are like the deaf and blind among people.\n\nTo receive form and live,\nIs the kin’s favor.\nTo nourish on grains and attain longevity,\nIs the ruler’s blessing.\nThrough learning, they become enlightened,\nIs the teacher’s virtue.\nTo grow and become an adult,\nIs also a kind of nobility.\n\nSpeech is the voice of the heart—\nTo convey oneself to others,\nWithout words, one cannot be heard;\nTo receive others into oneself,\nWithout words, one cannot be understood.\nThus, speech is the expression of the spirit.\n\nIf one does not let private words obstruct public words,\nAnd does not harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless,\nThen they hear the Dao deeply\nAnd do not stand alone against their superiors.\n\nLaozi says: Human nature,\nThe heart submits to virtue,\nNot to force.\nVirtue lies in giving, not in seeking.\n\nThus, the Sage who wishes to be noble among others,\nFirst makes others noble.\nWho wishes to be revered among others,\nFirst reveres others.\nWho wishes to conquer others,\nFirst conquers themselves.\nWho wishes to humble others,\nFirst humbles themselves.\nHence, nobility and humility,\nReverence and lowliness,\nThe Dao governs them.\n\nThe ancient Sages,\nWith their words, they led the people,\nWith their bodies, they followed behind.\nThus, the world gladly pushed them forward,\nYet they did not weary of it,\nAnd gladly bore them up,\nYet they did not grow heavy—\nThis was virtue overflowing and *qi* in harmony.\nHence, they knew that giving was taking,\nAnd following was leading.\nThey nearly reached the Dao.\n\nRitual values precedence,\nSpeech values humility—\nThis is human nature,\nThus they can be swayed by virtue,\nNot by force.\nHence, the Sage moves with measured steps,\nAnd acts with appropriate timing,\nThus the world gladly pushes them forward\nAnd gladly bears them up.\n\nLaozi says: Those with little virtue but much favor are ridiculed,\nThose with inferior talent but high position are in danger,\nThose with no great deeds but abundant wealth are despised.\nThus, some things benefit by being increased,\nWhile others are harmed by it.\nSome things are harmed by being decreased,\nWhile others benefit by it.\n\nThe common people know only to seek what is advantageous,\nYet they do not know to avoid what is harmful.\nOnly the Sage knows that harm can be advantageous,\nAnd advantage can be harmful.\n\nThus, the twice-hewn tree,\nIts roots must be wounded.\nThe household that hoards much,\nIts future must be cursed.\nThe greatest advantage,\nBecomes a source of harm—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nVirtue is never sated by abundance,\nBut one’s portion must not be exceeded.\nShallow waters cannot bear a great vessel,\nShallow roots cannot sustain a tall tree.\nIf a person’s virtue is thin and their talent shallow,\nYet they hold high office without benevolence,\nThey will rarely avoid ruin.\nOnly if one knows the reversals of advantage and harm,\nAnd does not cling to excessive hoarding,\nAttaining harmony between righteousness and gain,\nThen what harm remains?\n\nLaozi says: The petty person pursues gain with *guǒdé* (merely obtain),\nThe noble person pursues righteousness with *guǒyì* (merely uphold).\nThose who do good are not seeking fame,\nYet fame follows them.\nFame does not wait for advantage,\nYet advantage returns to them.\nWhat they seek is the same,\nWhat they strive for is different.\n\nThus, gain brings harm in its wake.\nThose whose words lack truth,\nWhose actions lack propriety,\nAre petty people.\nThose who excel in one matter,\nAnd are skilled in one ability,\nAre mediocre.\nThose who encompass all and possess all,\nWhose abilities are matched by their talent,\nAre the Sage.\n\nRound heads and square feet,\nTeeth clenched and hair worn,\nAll are human.\nYet the *qi* they inherit differs,\nAnd wisdom and folly divide them.\n\nThe petty person merely obtains,\nTheir talent outweighs their virtue;\nThe noble person merely upholds righteousness,\nTheir virtue outweighs their talent.\nIf one can ascend or descend,\nThey are mediocre.\nIf Heaven grants them many talents,\nThen they are the Sage.\n\nLaozi says: Life is a borrowed state,\nDeath is the return to it.\nThus, in times of order,\nThey defend righteousness with their life,\nIn times of chaos,\nThey defend their life with righteousness.\nOn the day of death,\nTheir actions reach their end.\n\nThus, the noble person carefully attends to this single use alone.»",

when the time is right, they advance with righteousness—what greater fortune?\nWhen the time is not, they withdraw with propriety—what greater misfortune?\nYet even in poverty and lowliness, they regret nothing,\nFor they have found what is truly precious.\n\nBorn by Heaven’s command,\nShaped into human form—\nLife is a borrowed state,\nDeath is the return to it.\nWhat one encounters in the

guaranteed;\nThey refrain from wrongdoing,\nYet calamity is not always avoided.\n\nWhen the time is right, they ride the tide;\nWhen it is not, they travel with humility—\nNobility lies within.\n\nLaozi says:\nWithin the heart, there is the *qi* of harmony and discord.\nWhen the heart is ordered, the *qi* flows smoothly;\nWhen the heart is disordered, the *qi* becomes inverted.\nThe order or disorder of the heart lies in the Dao.\n\nTo attain the Dao is to order the heart;\nTo lose the Dao is to disorder it.\nAn ordered heart brings mutual yielding;\nA disordered heart brings mutual contention.\nYielding brings virtue;\nContention breeds harm.\nVirtue brings smooth *qi*;\nHarm brings inverted *qi*.\nSmooth *qi* means self-sacrifice to benefit others;\nInverted *qi* means harming others for self-gain.\nThe *qi* can be regulated by the Dao.\n\nHeaven’s Way is like the echo answering sound—\nVirtue accumulated brings blessings;\nCalamity accumulated brings resentment.\nLearning is undermined by official favor;\nFilial piety wanes through wife and children;\nTrouble arises from neglecting worries;\nIllness worsens when near recovery.\nThus, to attend to

raise the straight with the crooked—\nDo not let them proceed.\nThis is called \"same filth, different mud.\"\nWhy not say \"raise the crooked and set the straight\"?\nBut to raise the crooked with the straight—\nThis is to elevate the petty and return them to the noble—\nHow could this not succeed?\nTo raise the straight with the crooked—\nThis is to push the noble into the petty’s domain—\nThe noble will not go.\nSame filth, different mud—\nTo dwell in the petty’s Way,\nHarmonious yet unmoved.\n\nLaozi says:\nThe Sage treats death and life alike,\nThe fool also treats death and life alike.\nThe Sage’s equality of death and life\nLies in understanding the divisions of principle;\nThe fool’s equality of death and life\nLacks knowledge of where harm and benefit lie.\n\nThe Dao is the countenance of Heaven,\nThings are the spread of Earth,\nHarmony belongs to humanity.\nWhen the ruler is not harmonious,\nHeaven’s *qi* does not descend,\nEarth’s *qi* does not ascend,\nYin and Yang are unbalanced,\nWinds and rains are untimely,\nAnd the people suffer hunger and sickness.\nHarmony’s use is supreme.\n\nHeaven gains clarity in all phenomena,\nEarth gains life in all things,\nHumanity gains success in all endeavors.\nHow could the ruler’s heart lose harmony?\nTo lose it means Heaven and Earth do not interact,\nAnd the people suffer hunger and sickness.\n\nThough the Sage and the fool share death and life,\nTheir difference lies between righteousness and self-interest.\nSelf-interest is the harmony of righteousness—\nThe Sage understands principle,\nAnd even the division of benefits is righteousness.\nThe fool knows not where harm and benefit lie,\nAnd righteousness becomes self-interest.\n\nLaozi says:\nTo command ten thousand soldiers\nIs not as valuable as hearing a single appropriate word;\nTo possess the Random Marquis’ pearl\nIs not as valuable as knowing the origin of things;\nTo possess the He Shi’s jade\nIs not as valuable as knowing the proper course of things.\n\nThough the world be vast,\nThose who delight in war perish;\nThough a state be secure,\nThose who love war are in danger.\nThus, even small states with tenfold weapons\nShould not use them.\n\nYu bowed to Chang Yan:\n\"Return the troops, and the Miao people will submit.\"\nTo hear a single appropriate word\nIs to triumph over ten thousand armies.\nTo possess

      "translated_text": "**Continuation of the True Mysterious Classic, Volume Five**\n*Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*\n**Chapter on Dao and Virtue**\n\nWenzi asked about the Dao, and Laozi replied:\n*\"Learning and inquiry are not refined, listening to the Way is not profound.\nAll who listen seek to attain wisdom,\nTo perfect their conduct,\nTo achieve fame and merit.\nWithout refinement, there is no clarity;\nWithout depth, there is no understanding.\nThus, the highest learning listens with the spirit,\nThe middle with the heart,\nThe lowest with the ears.\nHe who listens with the ears learns only on the surface;\nHe who listens with the heart learns to the marrow;\nHe who listens with the spirit learns to the bone.\nIf listening is not profound, knowledge remains unclear;\nIf knowledge is unclear, one cannot exhaust its essence;\nIf one cannot exhaust its essence, conduct cannot be fulfilled.\n\nThe principle of listening is this:\nEmpty the heart, clear the mind,\nDiminish the qi, let it not overflow,\nHold no thoughts, no deliberations,\nLet the eyes see nothing in vain,\nLet the ears hear nothing carelessly.\nConcentrate with precision, accumulate within—\nLet the inner intent gather and merge.\nOnce attained, guard it firmly,\nHold it steadfastly.\n\nHuman nature is the Dao,\nNature’s goodness is virtue—\nDao and virtue reside within us.\nThus, the Sage knows without learning—\nThis is called the Dao.\nTo cultivate it is called teaching—\nThus, what is within us is applied to others.\n\nThe middling and below can all learn it:\nListening with the ears brings delight to the heart,\nLike a mirror polished—\nIts light shines forth from within.\nIs this not what the heart inherently possesses?\nThrough study, it is made clear—\nTo cultivate the self brings virtue to fruition,\nTo govern the state brings success to undertakings.\nThis shows how refined learning illuminates the heart.\n\nThe Dao has no beginning in origin,\nIt begins with gentleness and weakness,\nCompletes with strength and vigor,\nBegins with few and short,\nCompletes with many and long.\nA ten-surrounding tree begins as a sapling,\nA hundred-foot tower begins with a foundation.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe Sage follows it:\nThe lowly humble themselves,\nThe retiring step back,\nThe frugal diminish themselves,\nThe self-effacing reduce themselves—\nThus, lowliness becomes exalted,\nRetreat becomes precedence,\nFrugality becomes abundance,\nSelf-effacement becomes greatness.\nThis is how the Dao of Heaven is fulfilled.\n\nQi is the formless essence,\nThings are the formed *qi*.\nThe formless is thus gentle and weak,\nThe formed is thus strong and rigid.\nThus, *qi* is the origin of form.\nThe Dao generates virtue, nurtures it,\nFrom subtlety to manifestation.\nThe Sage follows it,\nEstablishing its essence, enacting its function—\nThe Dao of Heaven is complete.\n\nThe Dao is the root of virtue,\nThe root of Heaven,\nThe gate to blessings—\nAll things depend on it to arise,\nDepend on it to flourish,\nDepend on it to find peace.\nThe Dao is non-action, formless,\nWithin, it cultivates the self;\nWithout, it governs others—\nAchieving success, establishing deeds.\nIt aligns with Heaven,\nDoes nothing yet accomplish all—\nNo one knows its essence,\nNo one knows its truth,\nYet within it, there is sincerity.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven has the Dao,\nThe world submits, and the altars endure.\nWhen lords and marquises have the Dao,\nThe people live in harmony, their states unlost.\nWhen scholars and commoners have the Dao,\nThey preserve their bodies, protect their kin.\nThe strong with the Dao conquer without war;\nThe weak with the Dao gain without strife.\nUndertakings with the Dao succeed, bringing blessings.\nBetween ruler and subject, the Dao brings loyalty and benevolence;\nBetween father and son, the Dao brings filial piety and kindness;\nAmong scholars and commoners, the Dao brings mutual love.\nThus, with the Dao, there is harmony;\nWithout it, there is harshness.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nThe Dao applies to all people.\nVirtue roots in the heart,\nSpirit manifests outward.\nSuccess achieved, deeds established—\nAligned with Heaven.\nFrom the Son of Heaven to the commoner,\nWith the Dao, there is prosperity;\nWithout it, there is stagnation.\n\nThe Dao:\nSmall practice brings small blessings,\nGreat practice brings great blessings,\nPerfect practice brings the world’s submission—\nSubmission brings loyalty.\nThus, the Emperor is the world’s *adaptation*,\nThe King is the world’s *direction*—\nWithout adaptation or direction, one cannot be called Emperor or King.\nThus, without the people, even the Sage cannot succeed;\nGaining the people yet losing the Dao cannot be sustained.\n\nThose who lose the Dao:\nAre extravagant, arrogant, and licentious,\nProud and insolent, boastful and domineering,\nSeeking to outshine others, grasping at power—\nThey become the instigators of strife,\nThe leaders of rebellion.\nWhen commoners act thus, they bring ruin upon themselves;\nWhen the great act thus, their states perish—\nShallowly affecting themselves,\nDeeply affecting their descendants.\nThus, no crime is greater than losing the Dao,\nNo resentment deeper than lacking virtue.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe root of the body lies in virtue,\nThe root of virtue lies in the Dao.\nWhether small or great,\nPractice it and you attain it—\nThe world submits to you,\nSubmission brings loyalty.\nThe Emperor is *adaptation*,\nThe King is *direction*—\nThe world adapts and follows—\nThis is called Emperor and King.\nYet only with the people can one succeed,\nOnly with the Dao can one endure—\nNot becoming the instigator of war,\nNot becoming the leader of rebellion.\nLose the Dao and there is chaos,\nLose virtue and there is resentment.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Those who practice the Dao make even the bold\nSo that spears cannot pierce them,\nMake even the cunning\nSo that strikes cannot find them.\nYet even so, they may still be humiliated—\nBetter to make the bold not dare to strike,\nThe cunning not dare to attack.\nBut even this is not as good as\nMaking them have no such intent at all.\nAnd even this is not as good as\nMaking them have no desire for gain.\nIf all men and women in the world\nWere to joyfully seek what is beneficial—\nThen even without a throne, one would be the sovereign,\nWithout an office, one would be the leader—\nAnd all would willingly seek what is beneficial for them.*\n\n*The Dao does not deliberately respond to things,\nYet things respond to it.\nTo be unharmed by spears or

      "translated_text": "「In ancient times, there was a man named Gēngsāngzǐ, whose virtue was such.\n\nWénzǐ asked about virtue, and Lǎozǐ replied:\nTo **nurture** and **cultivate** [畜之养之],\nTo **fulfill** and **lead** [遂之长之],\nTo **comprehend** and **share benefits** without discrimination [兼利无择],\nAnd to **harmonize** with Heaven and Earth [与天地合]—\nThis is what is called virtue [此之谓德].\n\nWhat is meant by *rén* [仁]?\nFor the ruler, it means not **boasting** of one’s achievements [为上不矜其功],\nFor the subjects, it means not **shaming** their weaknesses [为下不羞其病].\nToward the great, one is not **arrogant** [於大不矜],\nToward the small, one is not **petty** [於小不偷],\nTo **cherish** and **love** without selfishness [兼爱无私],\nAnd to endure without **waning** [久而不衰]—\nThis is what is called *rén* [仁].\n\nWhat is meant by *yì* [义]?\nFor the ruler, it means **supporting** the weak [为上即辅弱],\nFor the subjects, it means **upholding** propriety [为下即守节].\nWhen prosperous, one does not **indulge** in willfulness [达不肆意],\nWhen in adversity, one does not **alter** one’s principles [穷不易操].\nTo **adhere** to a single standard and **conform** to the natural order [一度顺理],\nWithout **bending** to private gain or **perverting** justice [不私枉挠]—\nThis is what is called *yì* [义].\n\nWhat is meant by *lǐ* [礼]?\nFor the ruler, it means **reverent** and **solemn** conduct [为上即恭严],\nFor the subjects, it means **humble** and **respectful** bearing [为下即卑敬].\nTo **retreat** and **yield**, guarding gentleness [退让守柔],\nAnd to **embody** the receptive principle for all under Heaven [为天下雌],\nTo **stand** where none dare [立於不敢],\nAnd to **establish** what none can [设於不能]—\nThis is what is called *lǐ* [礼].\n\nThus, when one cultivates virtue, the subjects **obey** one’s commands [修其德则下从令],\nWhen one cultivates *rén* [仁], the subjects do not **quarrel** [修其仁则下不争],\nWhen one cultivates *yì* [义], the subjects are **fair** and **upright** [修其义即下平正],\nWhen one cultivates *lǐ* [礼], the subjects **hold one in honor** [修其礼则下尊敬].\nIf these four are all cultivated, the state is **secure** and **tranquil** [国家安宁].\n\nHence, **Dao/Way** is what gives rise to things [物生者道也],\nVirtue is what makes them grow [长者德也],\n*Rén* [仁] is what brings love [爱者仁也],\nJustice is what brings rectitude [正者义也],\nRespect is what brings reverence [敬者礼也].\n\nWithout **nurturing** or **cultivating**, one cannot **fulfill** and **lead** to growth [不畜不养，不能遂长].\nWithout **compassion** and **love**, one cannot **achieve** and **complete** [不慈不爱，不能成遂].\nWithout **rectitude** and **upholding**, one cannot **endure** and **last** [不正不匡，不能久长].\nWithout **reverence** and **favor**, one cannot **be held in esteem** [不敬不宠，不能贵重].\n\nThus, virtue is what the people **value** [德者，民之所贵也],\n*Rén* [仁] is what the people **cherish** [仁者，民之所怀也],\n*Yì* [义] is what the people **fear** [义者，民之所畏也],\n*Lǐ* [礼] is what the people **revere** [礼者，民之所敬也].\nThese four are the **orderly principles** of culture [此四者，文之顺也],\nBy which the **sage** governs all things [圣人之所以御万物也].\n\nIf a **gentleman** lacks virtue, the subjects **resent** him [无德即下怨],\nIf he lacks *rén* [仁], the subjects **quarrel** [无仁即下争],\nIf he lacks *yì* [义], the subjects **act violently** [无义即下暴],\nIf he lacks *lǐ* [礼], the subjects **become disorderly** [无礼即下乱].\nThe four **classical teachings** [四经] not established—\nThis is called **lacking Dao/Way** [谓之无道].\nThere is none who lacks Dao/Way yet does not **perish** [无道不亡者，未之有也].\n\nVirtue is the **overarching name** of the Five Constants [德者，五常之总名].\nA person with virtue possesses the Five Constants in full [有德之人，五常备焉].\n*Cí* [慈] is **benevolence** [七则慈],\n*Yì* [义] is **appropriateness** [义则宜],\n*Lǐ* [礼] is **reverence** [礼则敬],\n*Zhì* [智] is **clarity** [知则明],\n*Sīn* [信] is **truthfulness** [信则实].\nThese are called the Five Constants [有之是谓五常],\nOr also the Five Virtues [一曰五德].\nNo **gentleman** has ever lacked virtue yet been able to **serve the state** [君子未有无德而能为国家者矣].\n\nWénzǐ’s inquiry was for the **benefit** of all under Heaven and future generations [文子之问，为天下后世发也],\nHis virtue was indeed **vast** [其德博哉].\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nIn the age of **supreme virtue** [至德之世],\nMerchants found **profit** in the markets [贾便於市],\nFarmers took **joy** in the fields [农乐於野],\nGreat officials **rested content** in their duties [大夫安其职处],\nScholars **refined** their **Dao/Way** [士修其道],\nAnd the people **rejoiced** in their **occupations** [人民乐其业].\nThus, the winds and rains did not **destroy** or **break** [风雨不毁折],\nGrasses and trees did not **wither** and **die** prematurely [草木不夭死],\nThe Yellow River **unveiled** its **Turtle Scripture** [河出图],\nAnd the Luo River **revealed** its **Book of History** [洛出书].\nBut when the age **declined** [及世之衰也],\nTaxes and levies were **without measure** [赋敛无度],\nSlayings were **without end** [杀戮无止],\nAnd **punishments** were meted out to the **virtuous** [刑谏者，杀贤士],\nThus the mountains **collapsed** and the rivers **ran dry** [山崩川涸],\nWorms and insects **teemed** without rest [蠕动不息],\nAnd the fields **yielded no grain** [野无百蔬].\nHence, when the age is **well-ordered**, even the **foolish** cannot **act alone in chaos** [愚者不得独乱],\nAnd when the age is **disordered**, even the **wise** cannot **restore order alone** [贤者不能独治].\n\nThus, the **sage** **harmonizes** and **adapts**, **preserving tranquility**—\nThis is **life** [生也].\nTo **fulfill one’s aspirations** and **practice the Dao/Way**—\nThis is **fate** [命也],\nSo **life** depends on **fate**, and only then can one **act** [生遭命而后能行],\nAnd **fate** is realized when the **time** is right [命得时而后能明].\nThere must first be its **age**, and only then can there be its **person** [必有其世，而后有其人].\nHeaven’s **regard** for humanity is like a father’s **regard** for his children,\nIts **love** is **equally distributed** [其爱均也].\n\nThe **ruler** is Heaven’s **firstborn son** [天之元子],\nAnd the people are Heaven’s **cherished children** [民，天之赤子].\nIf the ruler does not **care** for the people [上不恤下],\nHeaven will **send warnings** [天必示儆].\n\nIn the age of **supreme virtue**, love is **equally distributed** and **harmonizes** with Heaven [爱均合天],\nAll things **grow** in accordance [万物遂长],\nAnd the people **rejoice** in their **occupations** [民乐其业].\nWhen the age **declines**, harsh governance **disrupts** harmony [苛政干和],\nHeaven’s **wrath** **shakes** and **reveals** itself [天怒震发],\nThe earth **manifests** its **calamities** [地见其灾],\nThe state **abounds** in **difficulties** [国家多难],\nAnd **plagues** spread among the people [流毒民人].\nOnly the **sage** **harmonizes** and **adapts**, **preserving tranquility**,\nFulfills his **aspirations**, and **practices the Dao/Way**,\nThus the people and things **grow** in accordance [民物遂生].\nThis is what is meant by:\nThere must first be its **age**, and only then can there be its **person** [有其世而后有其人].\n\nWénzǐ asked about **sagely wisdom** [圣智],\nAnd Lǎozǐ replied:\nTo **hear** and **know** [闻而知之] is **sagely wisdom** [圣也],\nTo **see** and **know** [见而知之] is **wisdom** [智也].\nThus, the **sage** always **listens** to where **calamity** and **blessing** arise,\nAnd **chooses** his **Dao/Way** accordingly [而择其道],\nWhile the **wise** always **observe** where **calamity** and **blessing** take form,\nAnd **chooses** their **conduct** accordingly [而择其行].\nThe **sage** knows the **Dao/Way** of Heaven’s **auspicious** and **inauspicious** signs [故知祸福所生],\nThus he knows where **calamity** and **blessing** arise.\nThe **wise** **foresee** the **formed** signs,\nThus he knows the **gates** of **calamity** and **blessing** [故知祸福之门].\nTo **hear** before they arise—this is **sagely wisdom** [闻未生，圣也],\nTo **foresee** the **formed** signs—this is **wisdom** [先见成形，智也],\nWithout **hearing** or **seeing**, one is **foolish** and **bewildered** [无闻见者愚迷也].\n\nWhy does the **sage** not say *shēngzhī* [生知] but *wénzhī* [闻知]?\nFor **innate knowledge** is **within oneself** [生知道在我者也],\nWhile **acquired knowledge** is **from external matters** [闻知事在外者也].\nThe **sage** **knows** before it **happens** [闻於未然],\nThus **calamity** and **blessing** are **foreseen** [祸福先知].\n**Wisdom**, however, must **await** the **formation** of events before **seeing** [必待事成而后见],\nAnd the **foolish** are **drowned** in **hearing** and **seeing**,\nYet **never** truly **know themselves** [终不自知],\nTheir **bewilderment** is indeed **great** [迷亦甚矣].\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nIf a **ruler** **loves** to **know** [好知],\nHe will **trust** the **times** and **rely** on himself [信时而任己],\n**Discard** the **calculations** of fate [弃数],\nAnd **employ** **benevolence** [用惠].\nThings are **abundant** in **wisdom** but **shallow** in **understanding** [物博智浅],\nTo **sustain** abundance with shallowness—\nThis has never **existed** [以浅赡博，未之有也].\nTo **rely solely** on one’s **wisdom**,\nOne’s **failures** will be **many** [独任其智，失必多矣].\nTo **love wisdom** is to **exhaust** one’s **arts** [好智，穷术也],\nTo **love courage** is to **court** **peril** and **ruin** [好勇，危亡之道也].\nTo **love giving** is to **lack** a **fixed portion** [好与则无定分],\nIf the ruler’s **portion** is **not fixed** [上之分不定],\nThen the people’s **expectations** will be **without end** [下之望无止].\nIf he **taxes excessively**, he will **become a target** for the people’s **resentment** [若多敛即与民为条],\nTaking little yet giving much—\nHis **numbers** will **never** be **sufficient** [其数无有],\nThus, to **love giving** is the **path** to **inviting grievances** [故好与，来怨之道也].\nFrom this, it can be seen:\nThat **wealth** is **insufficient** to **sustain** governance,\nAnd that **Dao/Way** and **arts** can **depend** on **clarity** [财不足任，道术可因明矣].\n\nThe **wise** do not **do** what they **cannot** do [智者不为其所不能为],\nNor **force** what they **cannot** force [强所不能].\nIf one does so, it is **not wisdom** [则非智矣].\nThen can wisdom truly be **loved**?\nTo **love wisdom** is to **exhaust** one’s **arts** [好智则术易穷],\nTo **love giving** is to **lack** a **fixed portion** [好与则分不定].\nExcessive **taxation** **provokes** the people’s **retaliation** [多敛民雠],\nAnd **inviting grievances** is the **means** to **disorder** [来怨之媒也].\n\nWénzǐ asked:\nHow did the **ancient kings** govern all under Heaven by **Dao/Way** [古之王者以道莅天下为之奈何]?\nLǎozǐ replied:\nBy **holding to the One** and **doing nothing** [执一无为],\n**Conforming** with Heaven and Earth’s **transformations** [因天地与之变化].\nAll under Heaven is the **great vessel** [天下大器],\nWhich **cannot** be **grasped** or **acted upon** [不可执也，不可为也].\nTo **act** upon it is to **ruin** it [为者败之],\nTo **grasp** it is to **lose** it [执者失之].\nTo **hold to the One** is to **see** the **small** [执一者见小也],\nTo **see** the **small** is to **achieve** the **great** [见小故能成大也].\nTo **do nothing** is to **guard** the **still** [无为者守静也],\nTo **guard** the **still** is to **bring rectitude** to all under Heaven [守静故能为天下正].」",

people **uphold them in common**.\nThe **wise** do not **wield virtue as a tool**,\nThe **courageous** do not **use force as violence**,\nThe **benevolent** do not **grant favors by rank**—\n**Unified**, this is the king’s **Way**.\n\nIf the king **frequently alters laws**,\nAnd the state **frequently changes rulers**,\nThis is worse than **having no king**.\n\nWénzǐ asked:\nHow many **principles** does the **Way of kingship** encompass?\nLǎozǐ replied:\n**One** alone.\n\nWénzǐ said:\nIn antiquity, some ruled by **Dao/Way**, others by **force**—\nWhy are they not the same?\nLǎozǐ said:\nThose who ruled by **Dao/Way** did so by **virtue**;\nThose who ruled by **force** also did so by **virtue**.\n\nThere are **five kinds of warfare**:\n**Righteous war**, **Responsive war**, **Angry war**, **Greedy war**, **Arrogant war**.\nTo **punish tyranny and aid the weak** is called **righteousness**;\nWhen the enemy attacks and there is **no alternative**, to use force is called **responsive**;\nTo **quarrel over trifles and fail to control one’s anger** is called **anger**;\nTo **covet another’s land** or **desire their wealth** is called **greed**;\nTo **rely on one’s nation’s size** and **boast of one’s people’s multitude**, desiring to **appear superior** to enemy states, is called **arrogance**.\n\n**Righteous war** brings **kingship**,\n**Responsive war** brings **victory**,\n**Angry war** brings **defeat**,\n**Greedy war** brings **ruin**,\n**Arrogant war** brings **extinction**—\nThis is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.\n\n**Dao/Way** is the **root of governance**;\nThe king rules by **Dao/Way**.\nWhen the **root is lost**, **chaos arises**,\nAnd **warfare ensues**.\n\nThus, though some ruled by **Dao/Way** and others by **force**,\nThough they seemed different, they **both returned to virtue**.\nTherefore, of the **five kinds of warfare**, only **righteous war** can bring **kingship**—\nThough it is **war**, it is also **Dao/Way**.\nHence it is said: **One alone**.\n\n**Responsive war** brings **victory**,\n**Angry war** brings **defeat**,\n**Greedy war** brings **ruin**,\n**Arrogant war** brings **extinction**—\nThese are the affairs of the **Warring States**, not the **warfare of kings**.\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nTo **abandon Dao/Way** and **rely on cleverness** is **perilous**,\nTo **discard principles** and **use talent** is **constraining**.\nThus, to **follow one’s proper role** and **conform to reason**—\nWhen **lost**, one need not **fear**,\nWhen **gained**, one need not **rejoice**—\n**Success is not what one strives for**,\n**Gain is not what one seeks**.\n\nWhen **receiving**, one **accepts without taking**,\nWhen **giving**, one **bestows without bestowing**.\nTo **generate in spring**, to **withdraw in autumn**—\nWhat is **generated** is not **resented**,\nWhat is **withdrawn** is not **held in grudge**—\nThis is **approaching Dao/Way**.\n\n**Dao/Way** lies in **governance**,\n**Principles** relate to **timing**.\nTo **rely on cleverness** and **abandon Dao/Way**,\nTo **use talent** and **discard principles**—\nThese are the **steps to peril and constraint**.\n\nOnly by **following one’s proper role** and **conforming to reason**,\nWhen **gained**, one does not **rejoice in achievement**,\nWhen **lost**, one does not **fear retreat**—\nWhen **receiving**, one **accepts without taking**,\nWhen **giving**, one **bestows without bestowing**,\nTo **act in accordance with the seasons**,\n**Generation** is not **resented**,\n**Withdrawal** is not **held in grudge**—\nThen one **approaches Dao/Way**.\n\nWénzǐ asked:\nHow does a king **win the people’s affection**?\nLǎozǐ replied:\nLike the **great rivers and seas**—\n**Diluted**, **without distinct flavor**,\n**Used without depletion**,\n**First small, then vast**.\n\nThose who **seek to surpass others** must **lower themselves in speech**,\nThose who **seek to lead others** must **place themselves last in action**.\nAll under Heaven will **emulate their affection**,\n**Advance their benevolence and righteousness**,\nAnd **lack harshness**.\nTo **stand above** yet the people **do not feel burdened**,\nTo **lead ahead** yet the masses **do not feel harmed**—\nAll under Heaven **joyfully follow** without **tiring**,\nEven in **remote lands and alien customs**,\nEven among **insects and creatures**—\nNone fail to **hold them dear**.\nThere is **nothing they cannot communicate with**,\nAnd **nothing they cannot accomplish**—\nThus they are **held in highest esteem**.\n\nThe **rivers and seas** excel in **humility and capacity**,\nThus all streams **flow to them**.\nThe **ancient kings** modeled themselves after this to **govern**.\n\nTo **contain the people** and **nurture the masses**,\nThus they **won the people’s affection**,\nAnd the people **joyfully submitted**—\nAll under Heaven **rallied to them**.\nEven **grasses, trees, and insects** would **submit in awe**—\nTheir **nobility** is evident.\n\nLǎozǐ said:\nTo **clutch the laws of one’s age**,\nAnd **reject the customs of succession**,\nIs like **gluing a pillar to a zither**—\n**rigid and out of tune**.\n\nThe **sage** adapts to **circumstances**, **varies with the times**,\n**Sees the form** and **applies what is fitting**.\nWhen **ages change**, **affairs must change**,\nWhen **times shift**, **customs must adapt**.\nTo **discuss the age** and **establish laws**,\nTo **follow the times** and **conduct affairs**.\n\nThe **ancient kings** had **different laws**—\nNot **intentionally contrary**,\nBut because **circumstances differed**.\nThus, they did not **follow rigidly the laws already set**,\nBut **followed the principles behind them**,\nAnd **moved with transformation**.\n\nThe **sage’s laws** are **worthy of observation**,\nBut their **origins cannot be traced**,\nTheir **words can be heard**,\nBut their **intentions cannot be fully

Only to say what must be said.\nThose who say what must be said\ndo not speak with words.\nThe fisherman wades into the water,\nthe hunter chases the beast—\nnot for their own delight.\nThus the ultimate speech transcends speech,\nthe ultimate action transcends action.\nShallow thinkers contend for trifles.\n\nSpeech has its root,\naffairs have their master.\nOnly the ignorant\nremain unrecognized by me.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken—\nyet when spoken, it manifests things.\nWords are not the Dao.\nYet without words, it remains unclear.\n\nWhen Wenzi asked if one could speak of the Dao in subtle ways,\nand Laozi answered that only knowing what must be said is possible,\nthis is speech without speaking,\nand speaking without speech.\nThe fisherman and hunter—\nthese are those who do not know what must be said,\nclinging to words and fixated on things,\nthus their contests are for trifles.\nHow can one find those who transcend speech and action\nto converse with them?\n\nWenzi asked:\nDoes governing a state also have its principles?\nLaozi replied:\nNow, those who pull a cart,\ncall out *\"Left!\"* in front,\nand the rear responds in kind—\nthis is the song of urging the oxen forward.\nThough the melodies of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu differ,\nnone match this cart-puller’s true intent.\nGoverning a state relies on ritual propriety,\nnot on eloquent debate.\nThe more laws multiply, the more thieves and robbers arise.\nThose who rule a state are like Heaven and Earth:\nHeaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed;\nEarth does not utter, yet all things flourish.\n\nWhen Wenzi asked of the principles of governance,\nLaozi answered with the cart-puller’s song—\nfront calls, rear echoes—\njust as the Sage aligns with the natural order before Heaven,\nand follows the seasons after Heaven.\nGoverning relies on ritual propriety,\nnot on the superficial brilliance of words.\nTo ignore the fundamental order\nwhile multiplying laws\nis to provide thieves with legal pretexts\nand harm the people.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Dao has no fixed form yet can be the fixed form.\nLike mountains and forests yielding timber,\nyet timber does not equal mountains and forests;\nmountains and forests do not equal clouds and rains,\nclouds and rains do not equal yin and yang,\nyin and yang do not equal harmony,\nharmony does not equal the Dao.\nThe Dao is the state of form without form,\nthe image without image—\nthat which cannot be fully expressed,\nyet between Heaven and Earth\ncan be shaped and transformed.\nThe Dao has no fixed form—\nthings conform and take shape accordingly.\nTo observe mountains and forests transforming\ninto the harmony of clouds, rains, yin, and yang—\nthen one knows that all formless, imageless things\nbetween Heaven and Earth\ncan be shaped and transformed.\nThis is the Dao’s divine mystery.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe Sage establishes teachings and administers governance,\never mindful of their beginning and end,\nand how they shape destiny.\nThus when the people know writing, virtue declines;\nwhen they know calculation, benevolence declines;\nwhen they know contracts, trust declines;\nwhen they know mechanical arts, sincerity declines.\nThe zither does not sound,\nyet its twenty-five strings each resonate with their own note.\nThe axle does not turn of itself,\nyet its thirty spokes each exert their strength to revolve.\nStrings must have slack and tight\nto produce melody,\nwheels must have labor and rest\nto travel far.\nTo make the resonant silent,\nto make the turning still—\nthis is the way.\nWhen governing principles diverge above and below,\neasy governance becomes chaos.\nHigh station with great Dao brings fortune,\ngreat affairs with small Dao bring misfortune.\nSmall virtue harms righteousness,\nsmall goodness harms the Dao,\npetty debate harms governance,\nharsh scrutiny harms virtue.\nThe greatest rectitude is not precarious,\nthus the people are easily guided.\nThe most refined governance is effortless,\nthus the subjects do not rebel.\nThe utmost loyalty returns to simplicity,\nthus the people harbor no deceit.\n\nThe Sage establishes teachings and administers

(*wúzhī*),\nonly then can he truly **know** (*zhī*).\n\n**Harmony/And** is the **universal Dao/Way** of the world.\nThe heavens’ covering, the earth’s bearing—\nall align with the same **harmony/and**.\n\nThe **sage-king** (*huángdì*) wears the Round and walks the Square,\ndwells in the Great Hall and stands upon the Great Balance—\ncan his **harmony/and** be lost?\n\nThe **true person** (*zhēnrén*) returns to the **origin of things** (*wù zhī chū*),\nsurely he must have **unique insight** (*dújiàn*) within the **mysterious/void** (*míngmíng*).\n\nThus, **application** is to **not apply**,\nonly then can he **apply**.\n**Knowledge** is to **not know**,\nonly then can he **know**.\nThis is called **Great Harmony**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is what things **follow** (*dào*),\n**Virtue/power** is what life **sustains** (*fú*),\n**Ren** is the **manifestation of accumulated kindness** (*jī'èn*),\nand **Yi** is the **principle of alignment with the heart and fitting for the multitude** (*bǐyú xīn ér héyú zhòngshì*).\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** fades, **virtue/power** flourishes;\nwhen **virtue/power** wanes, **Ren** and **Yi** arise.\nThus, in the **Upper Age** (*shàngshì*), the **Dao/Way** is upheld but **virtue/power** is not yet emphasized,\nin the **Middle Age**, **virtue/power** is guarded but **Ren** and **Yi** are not yet embraced,\nand in the **Lower Age**, there is **fear of losing Ren and Yi** (*jīngjīng ér kǒng shī rén yì*), so **Ren** and **Yi** are clung to.\nTherefore, the **noble person** (*jūnzǐ*) cannot live without **Yi**—\nto lose **Yi** is to lose the very means of his existence;\nthe **petty person** (*xiǎorén*) cannot survive without **profit** (*lì*)—\nto lose **profit** is to lose the very means of his survival.\nThus, the **noble person** fears losing **Yi**,\nthe **petty person** fears losing **profit**—\nobserving their fears,\nthe paths to **disaster** and **blessing** diverge.\n\nWhen **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, **Ren** and **Yi** fracture,\nthe **sage-kings** and **kings** (*huángdì wángbó*) are divided—\nthis is the work of the **changing times** (*shìbiàn*).\n\nThe **Dao/Way** guides them,\n**virtue/power** nourishes them,\n**Ren** bestows kindness upon them,\nand **Yi** makes them **proper/right** (*yí*).\nThough the four ages differ in governance,\ntheir **noble rulers** and **ministers** maintain their **proper distinctions** (*yǒu fēn zé yī*).\n\nThose who uphold the **Dao/Way** but not **virtue/power** are **sage-kings** (*huáng*),\nthose who guard **virtue/power** but do not embrace **Ren** are **kings** (*dì*),\nand those who fear losing **Ren** and **Yi** are **lords** (*wáng*).\nWhen **Yi** loses its **proper alignment** (*qǐ yí shī qí yí*),\n**crafty deceit** (*zhìzhà*) thrives.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Some seek profit and thereby harm themselves,\nsome seek harm and thereby profit themselves.*\nTo **force** (*qiáng*) the **ill** (*bìng*) with **heat** (*wēn*) when they crave **warmth** (*rè*),\nto **force** the **thirsty** (*kě*) with **cold** (*hán*) when they crave **coolness** (*lěng*)—\nthis is how the **common folk** (*zhòngrén*) **nurture** (*yǎng*)

the **fool’s** (*yú*) **advantages** (*lì*),\nyet the **person of the Dao/Way** (*yǒudào zhě*) **avoids** (*bì*) them.\n\nThe **sage** (*shèngrén*) first **encounters** (*féng*) and then **unites** (*hé*) with the multitude,\nwhile the **common folk** first **unite** and then **encounter**—\nthus, the **gates of disaster and blessing** (*huòfú zhī mén*)\nand the **contraries of profit and harm** (*lìhài zhī fǎn*)\ncannot be overlooked.\n\nThere are matters where seeking **profit** brings **harm**,\nand seeking **harm** brings **profit**—\nnot even **human effort** (*rénlì*) can **guarantee** (*bì*) them,\nfor **things** may **cause** (*shǐ*) them.\n\nThus, those who **first oppose** (*xiān yǔ*) and then **unite** (*hé*)\nfollow the **sage’s Dao/Way** (*shèngrén zhī dào*),\nwhile those who **first unite** and then **oppose** (*yǔ*)\nfollow the **common folk’s Dao/Way** (*zhòngrén zhī dào*).\n**Disaster** and **blessing**, **profit** and **harm**,\nlie in wait—\ntheir **unpredictability** (*bùkě bù chá*) is thus.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Those with **meritorious deeds** (*yǒng*) yet **divergent from Ren and Yi** will be **suspected** (*yí*),\nthose with **guilt** (*zuì*) yet **aligned with Ren and Yi** will be **trusted** (*xìn*).*\nThus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the **constant proper alignment** (*chángshùn*) of affairs,\nthe **most honored rank** (*zūnjué*) in the world.\n\nThough **plans** (*móu*) and **calculations** (*jì*) may **seem correct** (*dāng*),\nand **worries** (*yōu*) and **concerns** (*huàn*) may **be solved** (*jiě tú*),\nif the **state** (*guó*) is preserved,\nyet one’s **affairs** (*shì*) **diverge from Ren and Yi**,\nhis **merits** (*gōng*) will **not be fulfilled** (*bù suì*).\n\nThough **words** (*yán*) may **not align** (*wúzhòng*) with **strategy** (*cè*),\nand **calculations** may **not benefit** (*wúyì*) the **state**,\nif one’s **heart** (*xīn*) is **loyal** (*zhōu*) to the **lord** (*jūn*),\nand **affairs** are **aligned with Ren and Yi** (*héyú rén yì*),\none’s **life** (*shēn*) will **surely be preserved** (*bì cún*).\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"A hundred words, a hundred calculations, often **not fitting** (*bùdāng*),\nare **not as good as** (*bùruò*) **abandoning haste** (*shě qū*) and **carefully examining Ren and Yi** (*shěn zhū rén yì*).*\n\n**Ren** and **Yi** are the **grandchildren** (*sūn*) of the **Dao/Way**,\nthe **children** (*zǐ*) of **virtue/power**—\nyet the four **never fail to interrelate** (*fù ruò bù xiāngjí*),\nand **never truly separate** (*xiānglí*).\n\nThus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the **most honored rank** in the world—\nfor those who **value their own bodies** as the **world** (*wéi tiānxià zhě*),\ncan they **not abandon haste** and **examine carefully** these **Ren** and

      "translated_text": "The **Laozi** says: The **Sage** is like the heavens covering and the earth bearing, the sun and moon shining upon all, the **Yin** and **Yang** harmonized, the four seasons transforming—embracing all things yet not conforming, neither rigidly old nor newly fanciful, neither distant nor close in favor.\n\nThus, the **Sage** can follow the **Heavenly Dao**, for **Heaven** does not act at one time, the earth does not hoard one kind of wealth, and humans do not pursue one kind of affair. Therefore, undertakings are manifold, and actions proceed in diverse directions. Thus, those who wield arms may act with lightness or weight, greed or restraint—these four opposites cannot be uniformly applied.\n\nThe light of heart may wish to strike, the heavy of heart may wish to halt, the greedy may wish to seize, the restrained may see no profit—yet this is not their true nature. Therefore, the bold can be ordered to advance and fight, but not to hold fast to the unyielding; the heavy can be ordered to stand firm, but not to assail the enemy; the greedy can be ordered to attack and take, but not to divide spoils; the restrained can be ordered to keep their share, but not to advance and seize; the trustworthy can be ordered to uphold strictures, but not to adapt to circumstances.\n\nThe **Sage** employs these five qualities in combination, assigning them according to their talents. **Heaven** and **Earth** do not favor one thing, nor do **Yin** and **Yang** produce one kind of being. Therefore, the sea does not refuse the trickling waters to become vast, the mountains and forests do not reject the crooked and bent to become lofty, and the **Sage** does not spurn the humble words of the common folk to broaden their influence.\n\nTo cling to one corner while neglecting the rest, to take one thing while discarding others—this is to make one’s gains few and one’s governance shallow. **Heaven’s** command is singular, yet the **qi** of sensation varies, nature follows substance in difference, and transformation yields myriad distinctions—these cannot be arbitrarily forced into uniformity.\n\nThe **Sage** aligns with **Heaven** and follows the **Dao**, not regarding diverse regions and customs as obstacles, but covering and bearing them, nourishing and fostering them, all in one principle. **Laozi** says: What **Heaven** covers and the earth bears, what the sun and moon illuminate—though their forms differ and their natures vary, each finds its own place of rest.\n\nWhat brings **joy** also brings **sorrow**, what brings **rest** also brings **peril**. Thus, the **Sage** tends the people by letting each follow their nature, rest in their dwelling, dwell where they suit, do what they are able, adapt to what they meet, and apply what they need. In this way, all things are in harmony, with no cause for mutual offense.\n\nAll things under **Heaven** have no intrinsic nobility or baseness; they are made noble by what is valued, and all things are noble. They are made base by what is despised, and all things are base. Therefore, the **Sage** who does not exalt the worthy does not cast fish into trees nor drown birds in deep pools.\n\nA good shepherd of the people does not apply one law to all; though forms differ and natures vary, each finds their own place of rest. If one reverses this and forces uniformity, the **Dao** of life is lost.\n\nNow then, what **Zhuangzi** called *Qíwùlùn* (\"On Equalizing Things\")—is it truly about equalizing things? It is about the **logic of equalizing things**. **Heaven’s** creation of beings assigns each according to their inherent talents and strengthens them accordingly.\n\nIn the time of **Yao**, his governance of the world saw **Shun** as Minister of Instruction, **Xie** as Minister of War, **Yu** as Minister of Works, **Houji** as Master of Fields, and **Xizhong** as Master of Crafts. In guiding the people, those dwelling near water were taught fishing, those in forests were taught hunting, those in valleys were taught herding, and those on land were taught farming.\n\nThe land suited their labors, their labors suited their tools, and their tools suited their talents. In the marshes, nets were woven; on the hillsides, fields were tilled. Thus, the people found ease in what they possessed, and what they lacked they exchanged for what they had skill in, while what they had skill in they exchanged for what they lacked. Therefore, few abandoned him, and many obeyed, like the wind passing through reeds, stirring them effortlessly.\n\nEach responded according to their clarity or turbidity, and all sought what benefited them and avoided what harmed them. Thus, neighboring states looked upon one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs were heard across borders, yet footsteps did not cross into the domains of the lords, nor were tracks left beyond a thousand miles—all rested in their own dwellings.\n\nTherefore, a chaotic state seems like a well-ordered one, a flourishing state seems like a decaying one, a state with abundance seems like one lacking, and a state with survival seems like one with excess.\n\nThe decaying is not without people, but each guards their own role; the flourishing is not from many people, but all are bent toward trivial pursuits; the abundant is not from excess wealth, but from moderation and few demands; the lacking is not from scarcity, but from sparse people and heavy expenditures.\n\nThus, the laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation, but what they followed; their punishments and executions were not their own doing, but what they upheld—the **highest virtue’s Dao**.\n\nThe ancient rulers of the world were at ease while their ministers labored, governing without action. In **Yao’s** time, **Shun** was Minister of Instruction, **Xie** was Minister of War, **Yu** was Minister of Works, and all officials held their posts, each according to their ability. When the right person was placed in office, the people rested in their dwellings, and the work was accomplished, the affairs settled—all the people said, *\"This is as if by nature.\"*\n\n**Laozi** says: To govern the world with the **Dao** is not to alter human nature, but to clarify and smooth what already exists. Therefore, to follow is great, to impose is small.\n\nThe ancient who dredged water followed its flow, those who grew crops followed the land’s suitability, and those who waged war followed the people’s desires. To follow is to have no rival in the world.\n\nThings must first be in accordance with their nature before human affairs can be properly ordered. Therefore, the ancient kings’ institutions were based on human nature, establishing measures and regulations to guide it.\n\nWithout its nature, one cannot make it conform to instruction; with its nature but lacking the means, one cannot make it follow the **Dao**. Human nature has the potential for **virtue** and **righteousness**, yet without the **Sage’s** guidance, laws and regulations cannot make it turn toward the proper path.\n\nTo act against its nature, one must use what it dislikes to restrain deceit—thus, punishments are not applied, yet authority spreads like the divine. To act with its nature, the world listens and follows; to act against it, laws and regulations are proclaimed yet ignored.\n\nThe **Sage** establishes teaching in accordance with human nature and observes customs to govern. What the people love, the **Sage** loves; what the people hate, the **Sage** hates. Thus, the people’s hearts turn toward him, and he has no rival in the world.\n\n**Dao** and **virtue** are the roots of merit and renown, what the people cherish. When the people cherish them, merit and renown are established.\n\nThe ancient who excelled in rule followed the **Dao** of the great rivers: the great rivers act without action to become vast, sink low to become broad, and thus endure as the world’s channels and valleys.

merge.\nAbove and below remain unlost,\nunited as one,\ndivided into five,\nthen returning to merge—\nnecessarily conforming to the square and compass.\n\nThe **Dao** is most intimate yet cannot be

scrutiny fail to seek goodness to serve their superiors and thus bring ruin.\nThus, the **Sage** follows Heaven and Earth in transforming their **virtue**—\nHeaven covers, Earth bears,\nguiding by

lost principle,\nthe world scorned them.\n\nWhen the **Mysterious Sage** does not act,\nthe **Plain King** follows,\nestablishing words and teachings,\nbecoming the teacher for ten thousand generations.\nWhen a **Sage** arises again,\nnothing can replace them.\n\nThe **Dao** as sovereign\nis like a corpse standing solemn and silent,\nyet the world receives its blessings—\none person covered by it is not excessive,\nten thousand covered by it is not confined.\nThus, excessive kindness is as harmful as excessive cruelty—\nboth encounter the **Dao**.\n\nKindness is giving without merit,\nbestowing high rank without labor—\nthen those in office grow slack,\nand idlers rush forward eagerly.\nCruelty is killing without guilt,\npunishing those who follow the **Dao**—\nthen those who cultivate themselves cease to encourage virtue\nwhile evildoers grow bold in defiance.\n\nThus, excessive kindness breeds deceit,\nexcessive cruelty breeds chaos—\ndeceit and chaos are the winds

      "translated_text": "**Volume Nine of *The Continuation of the True Mystic Classic’s Meaning*\n*Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*\n*The Chapter on Lower Virtue***\n\nLaozi says:\nTo govern oneself, the highest is to nurture the spirit, the next is to nurture the form. When the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil, all limbs are at ease—this is the foundation of life-nurturing.\nTo plump the flesh and fill the belly, to indulge desires—this is the superficiality of life-nurturing.\n\nTo govern the realm, the highest is to nurture the transformation of the people, the next is to rectify the laws. When the people naturally yield to one another, vie for humility, compete to receive less profit, and vie to undertake labor, day by day they transform toward the superior and abandon their old ways without knowing why—this is the foundation of governance.\nWhen rewards are generous and thus virtue is encouraged, when punishments are feared and thus wrongdoing is avoided, when laws are properly established above and the people submit below—this is the superficiality of governance.\n\nIn ancient times, the focus was on the foundation; in later times, on the superficial. Lower virtue is the rigid adherence to virtue.\n\nThe highest in governing oneself is to nurture the spirit—this is the foundation of self-cultivation. The next is to nurture the form—this is the superficiality of self-cultivation.\nThe highest in governing the realm is to nurture the transformation of the people—this is the foundation of governance. The next is to rectify the laws—this is the superficiality of governance.\nDescending further, there are still those beneath lower virtue.\n\nLaozi says: The ruler who seeks to govern does not appear in every age; the capable minister who can assist him is not found in every ten thousand. To seek such a minister with a ruler who appears so rarely is why perfect governance is not achieved even once in a thousand years.\n\nThe achievements of hegemons and kings are not established in every age. If one follows the people’s good intentions and guards against their corrupt hearts, sharing with them the same Dao, then the people can be made virtuous, and customs refined.\nWhat makes the sage noble is not his imposition of punishments for crimes, but his understanding of where disorder arises.\nIf one opens the sharp inclinations of the people and follows them into licentiousness and excess, then abandons them to the law and punishes them with penalties—even if they ravage the world, their deceit cannot be restrained.\n\nThe gathering of wise and virtuous leaders is a chance encounter once in a thousand years.\nThe sage ruler does not appear in every age; the capable minister is not found in every ten thousand. When a ruler who appears so rarely obtains even one such minister—from the Tang and Yu onward, like Tang’s encounter with Yi Yin or Wen Wang’s with Lü Wang—such instances are rare in history.\nEven figures like Guan Zhong under Qi Huan are not common.\nThus, governance flourishes rarely, while disorder prevails often—perhaps because virtuous men are few while the petty are many?\n\nLaozi says: To dwell above the lakes and rivers while one’s heart is beneath the imperial gate—this is to cherish life.\nTo cherish life is to disregard profit lightly.\nYet if one cannot overcome oneself and instead indulges, the spirit suffers no harm.\nIf one cannot overcome oneself and yet forcibly resists, this is called severe injury.\nThose who suffer severe injury will not live long.\nThus it is said:\nTo know harmony is to know constancy;\nTo know constancy is to know clarity;\nTo benefit life is auspicious;\nTo let the heart command the qi is strength—\nThis is called *Xuan Tong* (Mysterious Harmony).\nTo use its radiance and return to its clarity.\nHumans have careers and retirement;\nThe Dao knows no bending or stretching.\nThough one’s body may be in the lakes and rivers while the heart is at the imperial gate, one does not forget the fields.\nThus, those who embody the Dao retire with this Dao, act with this Dao—when the time is to stop, they stop; when the time is to act, they act.\nThis is called *Xuan Tong*.\n\nLaozi says: Nothing is easier than doing good, nothing harder than doing evil.\nWhat is called easy to do as good is to remain still and do nothing, to follow nature’s excess without enticement, to preserve one’s true self without alteration—thus it is said that doing good is easy.\nWhat is called hard to do as evil is usurpation, regicide, arrogance, and licentiousness—restless and desiring much, contrary to human nature—thus it is said that doing evil is hard.\nWhat is now considered a great calamity arises from the absence of moderation and measure.\nThus, in places of gain and harm, at the juncture of fortune and misfortune, one must be discerning.\nThe sage has no desires, no avoidance.\nIf one desires something, it is enough to lose it;\nIf one avoids something, it is enough to invite it.\nWhen the will desires, one forgets what one is doing.\nThus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness, adapts to the measure of giving and receiving,\nbalances the emotions of love and hate,\nharmonizes the rhythms of joy and anger.\nWhen action and stillness are appropriate, calamity does not intrude;\nWhen giving and receiving are measured, guilt does not accumulate;\nWhen love and hate are balanced, worry does not approach;\nWhen joy and anger are harmonized, resentment does not arise.\nGood and evil differ in appearance but share the same origin in the heart.\nNothing is easier than doing good, nothing harder than doing evil.\nThe steps to fortune and misfortune are uncertain—what one seeks to gain is lost, what one seeks to avoid is encountered.\nThus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness,\nharmonizes the rhythms of joy and anger,\nand in all things does no wrong—what cause is there for resentment?\nThose who embody the Dao do not greedily take what they should not,\ndo not reject what they possess.\nThey are always full yet never overflowing,\nconstantly empty yet easily sustained.\nThus, if one aligns with Daoist principles and measures,\nfood suffices to fill the empty,\nclothing suffices to ward off cold,\nand the body of seven spans is kept warm and nourished.\nWithout Daoist principles and measures,\neven the power of a great kingdom is insufficient for satisfaction,\nand the wealth of the world is insufficient for joy.\nThus the sage maintains a tranquil heart and easy will,\nguards the spirit within,\nand external things cannot deceive.\nThere is a method to cultivating oneself and an art to navigating the world.\nThose who embody the Dao uphold their natural endowment,\nfind ease in their fate,\nand eat only to fill the empty,\nclothe themselves only to ward off cold.\nThey do not greedily take what they should not,\ndo not abandon what they possess.\nMisfortune cannot be avoided, but fortune is not sought recklessly.\nIn prosperity, they do not grow arrogant;\nin adversity, they do not abandon their principles.\nThey take joy in the natural state,\nand endure with the Dao.",

sweet and bitter—\nthen the *pǔ* scatters and becomes tools.\n\nWhen establishing *rényì* and cultivating rites and music,\nthen virtue shifts and becomes artifice.\n\nThe people adorn their cleverness to deceive the simple,\nemploy deceit to attack their superiors—\nyet though some may uphold it, none can govern through it.\n\nFor when wisdom grows ever more intricate while virtue

thunder and lightning are to bells and drums,\nas wind and rain are to music and rhythm,\nall are shaped from their likeness.\n\nYet as vast as heaven and earth,\nas subtle as *shénmíng*,\nthere are limits to what can be fully explored.\n\nOnly the truly great remain pure and unadorned,\nyet can serve as teachers for all ages.\nLaozi says:\n\nThe governance of the truly great is empty and

that harm is inevitable.\n\nWhen *jīng* resides in the eyes, their vision is clear;\nwhen it lingers in the ears, their hearing is acute;\nwhen it stays in the mouth, their speech is precise;\nwhen it gathers in the heart, their thoughts are profound.\n\nThus, closing the four gates,\none remains free from harm all their life—\nthe four limbs and nine orifices neither die nor live,\nthis is called the *Zhēnrén* (True Person).\n\nThe earth’s production of wealth\nhas no greater foundation than the five phases.\nThe Sage regulates the five phases,\nand governance remains unerring.\n\nHumans

      "translated_text": "The Way of governance unfolds thus:\n\nWhen calamities strike and the people cannot fulfill his demands,\nthen the ruler pities them.\nBut the greedy and cruel tyrant drains his subjects like a fisherman who dries the pond,\nto sate his insatiable desires—\nthen the common folk suffer neither the harmony of Heaven nor the virtue of Earth.\n\nEmperor Yao ruled with compassion for his people as though they were his own,\ntaking from them with moderation and giving with measure—\nthus no one bore ill will toward him,\nand even the humblest could be ennobled.\n\nFor a wise ruler’s governance,\nhe must first assess the year’s abundance or scarcity,\nand gauge the people’s strength or depletion—\nthen take accordingly.\nIf he serves the people without resentment,\nHeaven itself will not reproach him.\n\nThe Master Lao said:\nThe *qi* of Heaven and Earth is nothing greater than harmony.\nHarmony means the balance of yin and yang,\nthe division of day and night.\nThus all things sprout at the Spring Equinox and mature at the Autumn Equinox—\ntheir growth and completion depend on the essence of harmony.\n\nExcessive yin does not generate,\nexcessive yang does not transform—\nonly when yin and yang intermingle\ndoes harmony emerge.\nHence the Sage’s Way is broad yet restrained,\nstern yet warm,\nsoft yet upright,\nfierce yet benevolent.\n\nToo rigid, it breaks;\ntoo yielding, it coils—\nthe true Way lies between hardness and softness.\n\nThe rule of the *guī* (plumb line) is thus:\nIt can be coiled and held,\nunwound and stretched,\nlaid straight yet not rigid—\nlong without bending, short without exhaustion,\nstraight without harshness.\nTherefore the Sage embodies it.\n\nWhen benevolence is extended, it becomes easy—\neasy without authority;\nwhen severity is extended, it becomes fierce—\nfierce without harmony;\nwhen love is extended, it becomes indulgent—\nindulgent without order;\nwhen punishment is extended, it becomes ruinous—\nruinous without distinction.\nThus harmony is most prized.\n\n*Qi* thrives when balanced—\nHeaven and Earth in harmony, and all phenomena manifest;\nyin and yang in harmony, and all things flourish;\nruler and minister in harmony, and the court is governed;\nfather and son in harmony, and the household prospers;\nsuperior and subordinate in harmony, and human affairs succeed;\nthe *róng* (nourishing) and *wèi* (defensive) *qi* in harmony, and the body is at ease.\n\nThe meaning of harmony is vast indeed!\n\nThe Master Lao said:\nThe reason a state endures is because it upholds the Way;\nthe reason it perishes is because it obstructs *lǐ* (principle).\nThus the Sage observes transformations to discern its essence.\n\nVirtue waxes and wanes,\nthe winds stir its first signs.\nHe who upholds the Way, though humble, will prevail;\nhe who shows signs of ruin, though powerful, will fall.\nA state’s destruction is not due to its vastness,\nthe Way’s success is not due to its smallness.\nThus endurance lies in upholding the Way, not in vastness,\nand ruin lies in abandoning the Way, not in smallness.\n\nHence rulers of chaotic states\npursue only territory and wealth,\nnot virtue and righteousness,\nseek only high rank,\nnot the Way and moral power.\nThey abandon what sustains them\nand create what destroys them.\n\nIf the ruler above disrupts the radiance of the Three Lights,\nand the people below lose faith in their sovereign—\nwho can endure?\n\nTherefore the prudent ruler\nneed not prepare against all men.\n\nThe Way that pervades the world is *Dao*,\nthe principle that never alters is *lǐ*.\nThus the Way and principle are the greatest.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, states that uphold the Way flourish,\nthose that lose principle perish.\nTo strive for high rank and vast territory\nwithout cultivating virtue and righteousness\nis like a tree without roots—\nits withering is inevitable.\n\nIn ancient times, rulers who deeply practiced the Way were called virtuous and righteous,\nthose who practiced it shallowly were called benevolent and righteous,\nand those who practiced it superficially were called observant of rites and wise.\nThese six—virtue, righteousness, benevolence, rites, wisdom, and the Way—\nare the cords that bind the state.\n\nTo practice them deeply brings abundant blessings,\nto practice them shallowly brings meager blessings,\nto practice them fully brings universal submission.\n\nIn ancient times, cultivating virtue and righteousness governed the world,\ncultivating benevolence and righteousness governed a state,\nand cultivating rites and wisdom governed a village.\nThe deeper the virtue, the greater the power;\nthe shallower the virtue, the lesser the power.\nThus the Way does not rely on strength or might,\nnor on cunning or competition,\nnor on greed or rivalry for attainment.\n\nIts foundation lies in the world embracing you,\nits victory in the world submitting to you,\nits attainment in the world giving itself to you—\nnot in seizing it for yourself.\n\nHence yielding becomes strength,\nsoftness becomes victory,\nbenevolence and righteousness bring true gain,\nand non-contention means none can contend with you.\nThus the Way in the world\nis like the rivers and seas.\n\nVirtue, righteousness, rites, and wisdom—\nrooted in the heart—\nwhen one man practices them, there are degrees of depth and breadth,\nand their application varies in weight.\nNames arise from reality,\nand the six are thus distinguished.\n\nYet though they differ,\nthe same goodness prevails—\nwhen the superior is good, the inferior dare not fail to be.\n\nLater ages neglected the cultivation of virtue and righteousness,\nrelying instead on coercive power to govern—\nand thus their states grew perilous.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is natural;\nartifice brings its loss.\nReputation is the guest of substance—\nno greater name than that of a ruler.\nIf a ruler has virtue, his name requires no seeking,\nfor the world bestows it upon him.\n\nTo receive it is to embrace it.\nWhat the world embraces is virtue.\nThus it is said:\nThe virtuous ruler, the world embraces;\nthe benevolent ruler, the land embraces;\nthe righteous ruler, the state embraces;\nthe observant of rites, the village embraces.\nWithout these four, the people will not embrace.\nIf they do not embrace, then war is used—\nand war is the perilous Way.\n\nThus it is said:\nWar is an inauspicious instrument—\nused only when there is no other choice.\nWhen used, it slays and wounds men;\nwhen victorious, do not revel in it.\nThus it is said:\nIn the land of death, thorns and brambles grow—\nthere one weeps in sorrow,\nand there one dwells in mourning rites.\nHence the noble pursues virtue and righteousness,\nand does not rely on heavy arms.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is natural;\nartifice brings its loss.\nReputation is the guest of substance—\nno greater name than that of a ruler.\nIf a ruler has virtue, his name requires no seeking,\nfor the world bestows it upon him.\n\nTo receive it is to embrace it.\nThis is why the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings excelled,\nand why the Five Hegemons

      "translated_text": "**Volume Eleven: *Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*\n*The Chapter on Supreme Virtue***\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who seek the **Dao/Way** must clearly discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasp the root of order and chaos, and clarify the mind to preserve it. To perceive its beginning and end, returning to the void and emptiness—this is called enlightenment.\n\nThe root of governance lies in **virtue/power** and righteousness; its branches are laws and institutions. That which sustains life is the root; that which does not is the branch. Root and branch are one body, yet their love is dual. To prioritize the root over the branch is the **worthy**; to prioritize the branch over the root is the petty.\n\nLaws arise to aid righteousness—yet if laws outweigh righteousness, it is like valuing one’s cap and shoes while neglecting one’s head and feet. **Virtue/power** and righteousness are vast and exalted. To extend their breadth without deepening their substance is ruin; to elevate height without broadening the foundation is collapse.\n\nThus, without great beams, one cannot bear great weight. To bear weight, nothing surpasses the **lignum vitae**; to govern a nation, nothing surpasses **virtue/power**.\n\nThe ruler’s relation to the people is like the foundation to a city, the roots to a tree. Deep roots mean a firm foundation; a thick base means stability above. Therefore, what lacks foundation in **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** cannot be called doctrine; what does not align with the ancient sages cannot be called the **Dao/Way**.\n\nTo merely select techniques for single acts or deeds is not the universal **Dao/Way**. The **worthy** discerns the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasps the root of order and chaos.\n\nGovernance has roots and branches; knowing what to prioritize brings one near to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**. Can such methods govern the world?\n\nLaozi says:\nThe **Dao/Way** of governing people is like **Zhaofu’s** driving of four horses. The reins and bit are aligned, the chest is straightened, the heart is internally harmonized, and the horses’ will is externally attuned. Thus, they follow the path, arrive far, with surplus **qi** and strength. Advance, retreat, turn, or curve—all as intended. Truly, he has mastered the technique.\n\nNow, power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; great ministers are the four horses. The body cannot abandon the chariot’s stability, nor can the hands lose the horses’ harmony. Thus, if the four horses are not attuned, **Zhaofu** cannot take the path; if ruler and ministers are not in accord, even the sage cannot govern.\n\nWield the **Dao/Way** to guide them, and mediocrity can be exhausted; clarify distinctions to instruct them, and deceit can be halted. Observe changes as things arise, respond to transformations as events unfold. The near will not be disordered, and the distant will be governed.\n\nWithout contrived teachings, yet attaining the natural **Dao/Way**, all actions will be without error. Heaven and Earth are one horse; all things, one finger. The sage’s penetration to the utmost is likened to chariots and horses for power and ministers, the ruler riding upon them without exertion, conquering all without resistance—this is the method of governance.\n\nHow can one who wields the reins speak otherwise?\n\nLaozi says:\nAll who practice the **Dao/Way** block the crooked paths, prevent darkness before it arises. They do not prize their own correctness but prize not doing wrong. Thus it is said:\n*\"Do not allow desire to arise; then there will be no daily seeking.\nDo not allow what can be taken to arise; then there will be no daily contention.\"*\n\nThus, private desires are released, and the public **Dao/Way** prevails. What is in excess is restrained by measure; what is applied is sufficient, and thus the world can be unified.\n\nIf one abandons duty to listen to praise and blame, discards merit to favor factions, then odd talents flee and hide, officials neglect their posts; the people’s customs decay in the state, and ministers contend in court. Thus, with the **Dao/Way**, one governs others; without it, one is governed by others.\n\nA skilled physician does not treat existing illness but prevents illness before it arises. Those who practice the **Dao/Way** block the crooked paths, govern what has not yet occurred—are they not like the skilled physician?\n\nThus, not prizing one’s own correctness but prizing not doing wrong means there will be no desire to seek what can be desired, no contention over what can be taken. Therefore, with the **Dao/Way**, one can govern others; without it, one is controlled by others.\n\nLaozi says:\nGovernance of the state has constants, yet benefiting the people is the root. **Political teachings** have a **Dao/Way**, yet proper conduct is paramount. If it benefits the people, it need not conform to antiquity; if it suffices for affairs, it need not follow custom.\n\nThus, the sage adapts laws to the times and rites to customs. Clothing and tools are made convenient for use; laws and decrees are adapted to necessity. Therefore, altering antiquity is not wrong, nor is following custom sufficient praise.\n\nReciting the books of the ancient kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as understanding their intent. To grasp their intent is beyond words.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken is not the constant **Dao/Way**; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nThe sage’s path is called the **Dao/Way**, like metal and stone—once tuned, it cannot be altered again; like the *qin* and *se*—when the melody ends, the tuning changes. Laws, institutions, rites, and music are the tools of governance, not the governance itself.\n\nThus, the narrow-minded cannot discuss the supreme **Dao/Way**, for they are bound by conventions and constrained by teachings.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the essence of law; law is the application of the **Dao/Way**. Governance of the state has constants, yet benefiting the people is the root—that is the **Dao/Way**. **Political teachings** have a **Dao/Way**, yet proper conduct is paramount—that is law.\n\nThe sage adapts laws to the times and rites to customs; laws and decrees are adapted to necessity. Thus, the narrow-minded cannot discuss the supreme **Dao/Way**, for they are bound by teachings.\n\nLaozi says:\nIs there truly a constant law in the world? What aligns with worldly affairs, accords with human nature, harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, and attends to spirits and gods—this can rectify governance.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns governed without laws, yet the people obeyed. The Five Emperors established laws but had no punishments. The Xia did not break their word; the Yin took oaths; the Zhou made alliances.\n\nIn the declining ages, they endured humiliation yet despised shame, coveted gain yet lacked disgrace.",

They will find it difficult to achieve what is fitting.\n\nTo preserve safety and restore order, even the wise are powerless; to uphold the **Dao/Way** by emulating antiquity, even the foolish have an advantage.\n\nThus, laws that are not applied, the sage does not enact; words untested, the enlightened ruler does not heed.\n\nThe sage establishes laws to prohibit deceit, redress wrongs, and protect the people. The Three Sovereigns ruled without decrees, yet the people obeyed. From the Five Emperors onward, the laws, rewards, and punishments of each dynasty differed—because the times changed.\n\nHow can an enlightened ruler fail to investigate this?\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: *\"Where do laws originate?\"*\n**Laozi** replied: *\"Laws arise from *yì* (proper conduct), and *yì* arises from satisfying the many. When the many are satisfied, this is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from Heaven nor emerge from Earth; they arise among people and return to self-regulation. If one attends to the root, disorder in the branches will not occur. Knowing the essentials, one is not confused by doubts; possessing them within oneself, one does not criticize others; lacking them within oneself, one does not blame those who uphold them. Those governed below must not neglect what is above; what is forbidden to the people must not be practiced by the ruler himself. Thus, the ruler’s laws serve as his own standard. If restraint begins with the ruler, then his commands will prevail among the people.\"*\n\nWhen **Wénzǐ** asked where laws originate, **Laozi** taught that laws arise from *yì*—what is fitting. The ancient kings established laws to suit the people’s sentiments, so they first set themselves as the standard: what they forbade among the people, they themselves dared not violate. Thus, their decrees were followed, and the world obeyed.\n\nLaws are the measure of the world, the standard of the ruler. To countenance lawlessness is to defy law itself. Once laws are established, those who conform are rewarded, and those who deviate are punished—even the noble are not lightly rewarded, and the lowly are not harshly punished. Those who break the law, though wise, must be punished; those who conform, though unworthy, are guiltless. Thus, public virtue flourishes while private desires are curbed.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people, preventing them from acting recklessly; rulers were established to control officials, preventing them from acting unilaterally; laws and **Dao/Way** were instituted to restrain rulers, preventing them from acting arbitrarily. When none may act recklessly, the **Dao/Way** prevails, and order is restored. Thus, it returns to *wuwei* (non-action)—not that it is inactive, but that its authority emanates from within.\n\nLaws are the ruler’s measure, the world’s standard. Once established, they must be applied without exception: those who break the law, even if noble, must be punished; those who conform, even if lowly, are guiltless. Thus, private desires are curbed, and public virtue prevails.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed, rulers established, and rites and laws instituted. When these three were not neglected, the world had no grievances, and society could return to simplicity—what need then for laws and decrees?\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"The skilled in rewards spend little yet inspire many;\nthe skilled in punishments minimize penalties yet deter vice;\nthe skilled in giving use sparingly yet cultivate virtue;\nthe skilled in taking amass much yet incur no resentment.*\n\nThus, the sage encourages the good by aligning with what the people favor and restrains vice by addressing what they abhor. Reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world fears to repeat. Hence, the greatest rewards cost nothing, and the severest punishments are never excessive. The sage governs with restraint yet achieves broad results—this is what is meant.\n\nTo give life, take life, and conceal—these are the **Dao/Way** of Heaven; to reward, punish, take, and give—these are the **Dao/Way** of humanity. The sage aligns above with Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and below with the people’s hearts, establishing the foundation for equitable governance.\n\nThose who hold the **Dao/Way** of the world must, in every matter, act with perfect virtue. Thus, reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world fears to repeat.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of the subject is to discern what is right, act first in matters, uphold duty, and clarify distinctions to achieve success. Thus, when ruler and subject differ in **Dao/Way**, order prevails; when they share the same **Dao/Way**, chaos ensues. Each must find their proper place, and all will have their due—then above and below can govern each other. Hence, branches must not surpass the trunk, nor extremities the root; speech and action must balance in weight and measure.*\n\nThose who wield authority hold little yet bear great responsibility, adhere to strict principles yet govern broadly. A tree ten *zhàng* in girth supports a thousand-*jūn* house—this is the power of structure; a five-*cùn* hinge controls the opening and closing—this is the power of position.\n\nOrders that must be obeyed bring benefit to those who comply and harm to those who resist—none dare disobey, for it is natural. When commands are issued and prohibitions enforced, it is through the collective force of the people.\n\n*Yì* (proper conduct) does not seek to benefit all under Heaven; benefiting one inspires the world to follow. Tyranny does not seek to harm all within the seas; harming one provokes universal rebellion. Thus, every action and decision must be carefully considered.\n\nThe ruler depends on the subject to stand, the subject depends on the ruler to act. The ruler must act with *wuwei* above, the subject must act below. To discern what is right, uphold duty, and clarify distinctions—this is the subject’s role.\n\nWhen ruler and subject each find their proper place, then above and below can govern each other, and great and small can restrain each other.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, differing from the Dao/Way is the path to governance—every action and decision holds weight in determining order or chaos, and the ruler cannot be too cautious in his deliberations.\n\nLaozi said: *\"To bend by an inch and extend by a foot, to yield in small ways and stand upright in great ones—this is the way of the sage.\"* Yet, when rulers judge their subjects, they fail to weigh their grand achievements, overlook their broad impact, and instead demand minor virtues, thereby losing the path to recognizing true merit.\n\nHence, one with profound *德* (virtue/power) should not be faulted for trifling matters; one with great renown should not be tarnished by petty flaws. For all human nature has its shortcomings, yet what matters is their grand vision—even if they have minor faults, these do not undermine their worth. If their grand vision is lacking, then their conduct in common affairs is unremarkable.\n\nThus, those overly strict in small matters achieve no great success, and those who censure others’ conduct are shunned by the masses. Those who grasp the greater whole have looser small constraints; those with vast ambition earn distant praise. This is the way of judging subjects.\n\nTrue full talents are rare in the world—this has always been so. The master carpenter seeks beams and pillars, not clinging to minor flaws, thus securing great materials. If a sovereign judges his ministers and advisors with the understanding of *\"bending by an inch to extend by a foot,\"* then great sages can be found.\n\nIndeed, no one is flawless in all things, nor are all deeds perfect. Abandoning the small to take the great—what grand endeavor cannot be accomplished? Overlooking the short to follow the long—what matter cannot succeed?\n\nLaozi said: *\"From ancient times to today, none have been able to perfect their conduct.\"*\n\nThus, the noble does not blame others for their failings. The square does not cut itself, the sharp does not slice itself, the straight does not overstep, the broad does not belittle—when it comes to *道* (Dao/Way), *德* (virtue/power), and martial prowess, the noble does not blame others.\n\nCultivating oneself through the Dao/Way and not blaming others is effortless. Cultivating oneself through the Dao/Way means one will have no regrets.\n\nThe *huang* (jade) of the Xia sovereign could not be without blemishes; the pearls of the bright moon could not be without impurities. Yet the world treasures them, not allowing minor flaws to overshadow their great beauty.\n\nNow, if one focuses on others’ shortcomings and forgets their strengths, yet still seeks to find merit in the world—this is indeed difficult. The common view holds that those of low station and humble birth, when faced with great dishonor, do not comprehend their grand vision.\n\nThus, the way of judging others is: observe their actions when in prosperity, their generosity when in wealth, their integrity when in poverty, and their restraint when in lowly status. See how they endure hardship to know their courage; observe their response to joy to gauge their resolve; test them with riches to measure their benevolence; frighten them to test their virtue. So, one may discern their true nature.\n\nThose who excuse themselves do not reform their faults; those who blame others cannot maintain true friendship. The noble does not blame others, knowing that not all are Yao or Shun, and thus cannot excel in every matter. If one has great talent, how can they be discarded for minor flaws?\n\nLaozi said: *\"To bend is to seek extension; to be crooked is to seek straightness. Bending by an inch to extend by a foot, yielding in small ways to stand upright in great ones—this is the way of the noble.\"*\n\nThough all streams flow together, those that do not empty into the sea are not valleys. Though all paths diverge, those that do not return to virtue are not the way of the noble. Good words are valued for their practicality; good deeds are valued for their benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe noble’s faults are like the eclipses of the sun and moon—they do not diminish their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act rashly, the brave do not kill recklessly. They choose what is fitting and act according to propriety, so that their deeds are accomplished and their achievements can be relied upon, and though they die, their names endure.\n\nEven if one has wisdom and ability, they must root themselves in benevolence and righteousness to stand firm. When wisdom and ability are both cultivated, the sage uses benevolence and righteousness as the central measure—those who conform are called noble, those who do not are called petty.\n\nThough the noble may die, their name does not perish; though the petty may gain power, their crimes are not absolved. To hold the map of all under Heaven in one hand while slaying oneself with the other—even the foolish would not do this, for life is more precious than all the world.\n\nTo face death for one’s sovereign and kin, one regards death as returning home—righteousness is heavier than life itself.\n\nThus, the greatest good of the world, when compared to life, is small; but life’s greatest weight, when compared to righteousness, is light. This is the measure of one who uses benevolence and righteousness as his standard.\n\nThe way of bending and extending is like the dragon and serpent in hibernation and arousal—nobles yield in small ways to stand upright in great ones, just as the dragon and serpent gather their *qi* before surging forward. Good words and good deeds nourish all living things, all arising from bending oneself to cultivate virtue.\n\nThe sage uses benevolence and righteousness as his standard, knowing that life is heavier than all the world, and righteousness is heavier than life itself. Thus, they can face death for their sovereign and kin.\n\nTherefore, though the noble may die, their name does not vanish.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The ranks of Dao/Way and virtue/power are like the sun and moon—even the barbarians cannot alter their course.\"* If one’s inclinations and actions are balanced, then their reputation is not bound by common opinion; if their intentions and conduct are harmonized, then their rise or fall depends on the times.\n\nIf their deeds are complete in the world, then their achievements are fulfilled; if their efforts align with the times, then their names endure. Thus, those who establish achievements and renown are simple in the world yet meticulous in the times—when the time arrives, there is no pause for breath.\n\nThe ancient warriors did not fight for land or riches, but to preserve life and restore order, to remove harm from the people. Those greedy for wealth and power, who covet many desires, bring ruin to the world, causing the masses to be restless and never at peace.\n\nWhen a sage arises, they punish the strong and violent, restore order to chaos, and remove harm from the world—turning turbidity into clarity, danger into security. Thus, they must inevitably rise and act.\n\nThe ranks of Dao/Way and virtue/power in humanity are like the sun and moon in the heavens; the five human inclinations are like the five stars. Even barbarians cannot alter their course.\n\nWhether one follows or abandons is in their own hands, not determined by others’ opinions. Whether they are used or not depends on the times; whether they succeed or fail hinges on their fate. Thus, the noble acts in the Dao/Way when the time is right, without pause for breath.\n\nThe Vermilion Sovereign caused the fire calamity, so the Yellow Sovereign subdued him.»",

      "translated_text": "共工 unleashed the water calamity, so Zhuanxu executed him.\n\nHe taught them with the Dao/Way, guided them with virtue/power, yet they refused to listen—then he confronted them with might and force. If they still did not comply, he subdued them with arms.\n\nTo slaughter the innocent and nourish the unrighteous—no greater harm exists. To exhaust the wealth of the realm for the desires of one—no deeper calamity exists. To indulge one’s own desires while prolonging the afflictions of the land—this is what the natural order rejects.\n\nThe reason kings are established is to suppress violence and chaos. Yet now, they exploit the strength of the people, only to become tyrants and bandits. How then can they not be removed? Just as one who raises fish must eliminate the otters, and one who tends beasts must eradicate the wolves—how much more so when shepherding the people?\n\nThus, the origin of arms and warfare.\n\nThe five phases of the state’s transformations have endured for ages. In the Fire Phase of the Vermilion Sovereign, the ruler lost his virtue/power, and fire became a calamity. In the Water Phase of共工, the ruler lost his virtue/power, and water became a calamity. Thus, it is known: when a ruler loses virtue/power, the corresponding phase brings disaster—this is the origin of arms and warfare.\n\nAll who govern lands—can they lose virtue/power and bring calamity upon themselves, yet remain unaware of warning?\n\nLaozi said: *\"The Way of governing a state is this: the sovereign issues no harsh decrees, officials impose no burdensome regulations, scholars engage in no deceitful conduct, and artisans practice no excessive craftsmanship. Their tasks are fulfilled without disturbance, their tools are complete without ornamentation.*\n\n*Yet in chaotic times, it is otherwise: those who act seek to outdo one another in extravagance; those who uphold ritual vie in false pretension. Chariots are over-elaborated with carvings, utensils are excessively adorned with engravings. Those who seek wealth compete to hoard rare treasures as precious; those who criticize culture pursue frivolous complications as urgent. Scholars engage in false argumentation, delaying decisions endlessly without aiding governance but fostering disorder. Artisans craft bizarre devices, taking years to complete, yet they serve no practical purpose.*\n\n*The Way of Shennong decreed: If men of prime vigor do not till the fields, there will be those who starve in the land. If women of childbearing years do not weave, there will be those who freeze. Thus, the sage himself plowed and his wife wove, setting an example for the people. He guided them, not valuing rare goods nor prizing useless objects. Therefore, the tillers did not toil excessively, yet had enough to sustain life; the weavers did not labor beyond measure, yet had enough to clothe their bodies. Neither surplus nor deficiency existed—each took only what they needed. With abundant food and clothing, deceit did not arise; with peace and ease, the realm was harmonious. The wise had no schemes to employ, the brave no valor to display. The methods of ancient and modern governance differ because customs change.*\n\n*In ancient times, people were pure and simple: the sovereign issued no harsh decrees, officials imposed no burdensome regulations, scholars engaged in no deceitful conduct, and artisans practiced no excessive craftsmanship. Thus, the people’s hearts were easily satisfied, and governance was not difficult. In later ages, customs shifted and winds changed; the sovereign’s excesses were emulated below, luxury became the norm, and greed knew no bound. Hence, the people’s hearts were hard to satisfy, and governance became arduous.\"*\n\nLaozi said: *\"The Way of the hegemonic king is this: he plans with strategy, he schemes with tactics. He acts with righteousness, not for mere survival, but to secure or destroy. Thus, when he hears of a neighboring ruler oppressing his people, he raises his army to their borders, accusing them of unrighteousness and reproaching their misdeeds. Upon arrival, he commands his generals: ‘Do not cut down trees, do not dig up graves, do not destroy crops, do not burn stores, do not capture civilians, do not seize livestock.’ Then he proclaims: ‘Their ruler defies heaven and earth, insults the spirits, judges unjustly, and slaughters the innocent. Heaven condemns him, and the people seek vengeance. Our army comes to abolish unrighteousness and bestow virtue/power upon them. Any who resist the heavenly order and harm the people shall be exterminated—root and branch. Those who surrender their households shall be rewarded with their households; those who surrender their neighborhoods shall be rewarded with their neighborhoods; those who surrender their districts shall be ennobled as lords of their districts. We conquer the state, but spare its people. We depose the tyrant, reform his governance, honor the virtuous, exalt the worthy, aid the orphaned and widowed, relieve the poor, release the imprisoned, and reward the meritorious.’ The people open their doors to welcome them, offering grain and provisions, fearing only that they may not arrive. A righteous army reaches the border and halts without battle. An unrighteous army arrives amid piles of corpses and flowing blood, clashing until all is lost.*\n\n*He who fights for the land cannot achieve kingship; he who fights for himself cannot establish his merit. He who acts for others gains their support; he who acts for himself loses them. Where the multitude aids, even the weak become strong; where the multitude abandons, even the mighty perish.\"*\n\nThe *Wenzi* comprises twelve chapters, of which three are primary and four secondary. It encompasses both the ancient sages and the hegemons—within it lie the emperors and kings. The age of hegemony was perhaps the autumn of the times? Observing its language—*\"not for mere survival, but to secure or destroy\"*—one sees the spirit of revival and restoration vividly, far removed from the unrighteous deeds of later ages.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The superior ruler governs the state, orders the realm, practices benevolence and righteousness, dispenses virtue/power and favors, establishes just laws, and blocks deceitful paths. His ministers and officials are loyal, the people are harmonious, and all hearts are united in purpose. The feudal lords submit to his authority, and the four quarters revere his virtue/power. He refines governance within the ancestral temple, and repels invasions a thousand li away. His decrees issued, the realm responds in unison—this is the highest attainment.*\n\n*In the next rank: vast lands, numerous people, a wise sovereign, capable generals, abundant wealth, strong arms, reliable discipline, clear orders. When facing equal foes, before a single blade is drawn, the enemy flees in rout—this is the secondary attainment.*\n\n*He knows the suitability of the land, masters the advantages of terrain, understands the shifts of oppressive governance, and discerns the tactics of battle.\"*",

      "translated_text": "To wield the blade in close combat, to face arrows and stones like rain, to carry the slain and tend the wounded—this is the lowest application of virtue/Way.\n\nThe triumph or defeat of armies lies in governance. When governance overcomes the people, the ministers submit and the soldiers grow strong. When the people overcome governance, the ministers rebel and the soldiers grow weak. When virtue/Way is sufficient to embrace the people of the realm, when undertakings are adequate to meet the realm’s crises, when appointments and promotions win the hearts of worthy scholars, and when counsel and deliberation resolve matters of weight—this is the highest virtue/Way of the military.\n\nThe *Art of War* states that the first to act is the host, the one who responds is the guest. There is a saying about warfare: *\"I dare not be the host and instead be the guest,\"*—meaning one must not act rashly in battle.\n\nWhen use of arms is unavoidable, then just cause is supreme; the enemy’s flight is secondary, and combat itself is the lowest recourse. Laozi said: *\"The reason a state grows strong is that its people are willing to die.\"* The reason they are willing to die is that their cause is just. The just cause succeeds because of its righteous might. Thus, to govern with *civil* means and align with *martial* force is called the way of inevitable victory; when righteous might and just cause are united, this is called strength.\n\nIn battle, when blades clash and arrows and stones fall like rain, and officers vie to lead—it is because rewards are trustworthy and punishments are clear. If a ruler regards his subjects as sons, they will serve him as fathers. If a ruler regards his subjects as brothers, they will follow him as elder siblings. If he views them as sons, he will reign over the four seas. If he views them as fathers, he will rectify the world.\n\nIf a ruler regards his subjects as brothers, he will not hesitate to die for them. If subjects serve their ruler as elder siblings, they will not hesitate to perish for him. Hence, when the bonds are those of father and son or brother and brother, such conflicts cannot be fought.\n\nTherefore, a just ruler refines governance within and accumulates virtue/power within the ancestral temple, while repelling evil without to demonstrate his might. He observes their labor and rest to know their hunger and fullness. When battle is certain, he treats death as returning home—such is the depth of his benevolence.\n\nThere is a Way to govern the realm—why resort to arms at all? Only when there is no alternative. The soldiers of a strong state die because they are compelled by just cause. Then, would a ruler of the Way tolerate a strong state that places its people in the path of death?\n\nIf a ruler regards his subjects as sons, and they serve him as fathers, then a just ruler who refines governance and accumulates virtue/power will see his state grow strong naturally—such examples exist in the world.\n\n*(End of Chapter Eleven of the *True Classic of the Mysterious Dao*, compiled by the Southern Valley Master Du Daojian.)*\n\n---\n**Chapter Twelve: The Way of the Realm** *(Compiled by the Southern Valley Master Du Daojian.)*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twelve: The Way of the Realm**\n*(The True Classic of the Mysterious Dao, compiled by the Southern Valley Master Du Daojian)*\n\n---\n\n**Section on Supreme Rites**\n\nLaozi said:\nIn the age of the ancient True Ones, they harmonized the breath of yin and yang, and all living beings looked up to their virtue/power in harmony. At that time, all things spontaneously aligned, their essence remained hidden and pure, and the world thrived in great ease.\n\nWhen the age declined to the time of Fu Xi, men grew dim and laborious, all seeking to abandon their childlike innocence and awaken to the world. Between heaven and earth, virtue became fragmented and inconsistent. When Shennong and the Yellow Emperor took leadership over the world, they established the framework of the four seasons, harmonized yin and yang, and thus all people stood in awe, straining their senses to listen and obey. Yet governance remained unbalanced.\n\nBy the time of the Xia and Shang dynasties, desires grew excessive, and wisdom was seduced by external things, so that nature and life lost their true essence. When this spread to the Zhou, refinement scattered simplicity, and they abandoned the Dao for artifice, perverting virtue into conduct. Cleverness and cunning emerged, and men mimicked the sages with deceitful learning, flaunting empty rhetoric to coerce the masses, polishing poetry and books to trade for fame. Each sought to impose their own intelligence, masking themselves in falsehoods to fit the world, thus losing the root of the great tradition.\n\nThus, the world has long suffered the decay of nature and life.\n\nTherefore, the study of the True Ones seeks to restore nature through stillness, to wander the heart in emptiness. The study of the common world, however, flaunts virtue/power and exhausts nature, agitating the five viscera, recklessly acting beyond wisdom, and clamoring for fame in the world—these are the things the True Ones do not do. To exhaust nature is to sever life.\n\nThe True Ones are fixed in the intent of life and death, penetrating the logic of honor and shame. If the world praises them, they are not further encouraged; if the world condemns them, they are not further discouraged. This is the essence of attaining the Dao.\n\nIs the \"supreme rite\" the five rites—auspicious, mourning, military, guest, and festive?\n\nThe ancient True Ones were the sovereigns of the primal age. At that time, all living beings were pure and simple, and the world thrived in great ease. From Fu Xi to Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, and extending to the Three Sovereigns, governance varied, and rites adapted accordingly, reaching their peak in the Warring States era. But the root was already lost.\n\nLaozi said:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings wore loose hair without collars and ruled the world. Their virtue/power gave life without taking it, gave without seizing, and the world did not reject their ways. All shared in their virtue/power. At that time, yin and yang were in harmony, and all things flourished. Birds’ nests could be reached by bending down, and wild beasts could be tethered and led.\n\nBut as the age declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became men’s adversaries. Thus, iron was cast and blades forged to repel these dangers. When people faced hardship, they sought convenience; when they encountered calamity, they devised defenses. Each used their intelligence to avoid harm and pursue benefit. Customs were not fixed, and tools were not permanent. Thus, the laws of the ancient kings were subject to change.\n\nTherefore, it is said: *\"The named is the named, but not the unchanging name.\"* The Five Emperors followed different Ways, yet their virtue/power covered the world. The Three Kings pursued distinct affairs, yet their names endured in posterity. This was adapting to the times.\n\nIt is like the blind musician Zhi Kuang tuning the five tones—his adjustments had no fixed measure, yet none were out of harmony. Thus, those attuned to the essence of music could compose melodies. Those who grasped the fundamental principles of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords could govern men.\n\nTherefore, the ancient kings’ institutions, if no longer fitting, were abandoned; the customs of later ages, if beneficial, were adopted. Thus, the sages who established rites and music were not bound by rites and music, those who governed things were not bound by things, and those who made laws were not bound by laws. Hence it is said: *\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\"*\n\nThe Way of Heaven has no constancy, and the world grows ever more degenerate. In ancient times, the sovereigns wore loose hair without collars, and the world did not reject their attire. The people and creatures flourished, all sharing in their virtue/power. But as the age declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became men’s adversaries. Laws and tools adapted to the times, and thus warfare arose.\n\nLaozi said:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings looked upward to the patterns of Heaven, downward to the measures of Earth, and inward to the laws of humanity. They regulated the qi of yin and yang, harmonized the rhythms of the four seasons, and observed the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and fertile or barren lands to establish affairs and generate wealth, removing the sufferings of hunger and cold, averting the calamities of sickness and misfortune.\n\nWithin, they received the affairs of humanity to establish rites and music, practicing the Way of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relationships. They arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to establish filial piety and form the family. They listened to the pure and impure tones of the five notes and the generative sequences of the six pitches to establish the obligations of ruler and subject and form the state. They observed the order of early, middle, and late in the four seasons to establish the hierarchy of elders and juniors and form the bureaucracy. They divided the lands into regions and assigned duties to govern them. They established the Grand Academy to teach—these were the fundamental principles of governance.\n\nWhen the Way is attained, it is upheld; when the Way is lost, it is abandoned. Nothing in the world remains stretched without relaxation, completed without ruin—only the sage can achieve completion without decay.\n\nIs the principle of Heaven’s unity the same as the principle of a man’s life? To know the beginning of life is to know the origin of all things, for the time before life is the time before all things.\n\nWhen a man is young and then grows strong, it is like the convergence and movement of the primal unity. When he grows old, it is like the passage of an age. To know that youth transforms into strength, strength into old age, and old age into death is to understand what comes after the origin of all things.\n\nAs for those who transform without being transformed—are they not the sages alone?\n\nWhen the sages first composed music, it was to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness, restoring the heart to its natural state. But as it declined, it became excessive and unreturning, indulging in sensuality without regard for proper law, spreading to later ages until it led to the fall of kingdoms.\n\nAs for their writings, they were meant to guide all affairs—so that the foolish would not forget, and the wise would record events.",

But when they declined, they indulged in reckless hunting and hawking, seizing the people’s time and exhausting their strength.\n\nAs for their promotion of the worthy, it was meant to harmonize teaching and governance, to adjudicate lawsuits fairly, to place the worthy in office, and to assign the capable to their duties. Benevolence spread below, and the common people cherished virtue. But when it declined, factions and cliques formed, each advancing their own allies, abandoning the public for private gain, and elevating outsiders and insiders alike. The wicked took office, while the worthy withdrew in obscurity.\n\nThe writings of **Wénzǐ** serve as a mirror for ten thousand generations.\n\nThe original intent of the sages in establishing these institutions was:\nMusic, to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness;\nWritings, to guide all affairs;\nParks and preserves, to provide for ancestral temple offerings;\nPromotion of the worthy, to harmonize teaching and governance, and to adjudicate lawsuits fairly.\n\nBut when they declined:\nMusic became an indulgence in sensuality,\nWritings became deceitful,\nParks and preserves became grounds for hunting,\nPromotion of the worthy became factionalism,\nAnd the wicked took office while the worthy hid away—this was inevitable.\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven and Earth is such that extremes reverse, and excess leads to loss.\nThus, the sages addressed decay by reforming institutions, and when one method reached its end, they introduced another. Their excellence lay in harmony, their failure in expedience.\n\nThe **Dao** of the sages states:\nWithout cultivating ritual and righteousness, propriety and shame cannot stand. If the people lack propriety and shame, they cannot be governed. Without knowing ritual and righteousness, laws cannot be properly enforced. Without upholding the good and abandoning the base, people will not turn toward ritual and righteousness. Without laws, governance is impossible. Without knowing ritual and righteousness, laws cannot be implemented.\n\nLaws may kill the unfilial, but they cannot make people filial. They may punish thieves, but they cannot make people virtuous.\n\nWhen the sage-kings ruled above, they made their preferences and disapprovals clear to the people, using praise and blame to guide them. They honored the worthy and advanced them, while they degraded the unworthy and removed them. They enforced punishments but did not rely on them; they cultivated ritual and righteousness and entrusted governance to the virtuous.\n\nThus, the highest in the land were the **Three Dukes**, the highest in a state were the **Nine Ministers**, the highest in a country were the **Twenty-Seven Great Officers**, and the highest in a village were the **Eighty-One Elemental Worthies**.\n\nThe vastness of Heaven and Earth cannot stand without humanity. The exalted status of the emperor cannot be sustained without the people. The multitude of the four quarters cannot be governed without ritual, righteousness, and shame.\n\nTherefore, the sages reformed decayed institutions and established new ones, using ritual, righteousness, and shame as the four cardinal supports. When the worthy were in their posts, ritual and righteousness flourished, and punishments were rarely used.\n\nTo surpass ten thousand people in wisdom was called **Yīng** (英),\nTo surpass a thousand was called **Zhì** (智),\nTo surpass a hundred was called **Jié** (杰),\nTo surpass ten was called **Háo** (豪).\n\nOne who understood the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth, and grasped the principles of human nature,\nWhose breadth could embrace the multitude, whose benevolence could win the distant,\nWhose wisdom could discern expedience—such a person was **Yīng** (英);\n\nOne whose virtue could teach and transform, whose conduct could uphold righteousness,\nWhose trustworthiness could win the people, whose clarity could illuminate below—such a person was **Zhì** (智);\n\nOne whose conduct could serve as a model, whose wisdom could resolve doubts,\nWhose trustworthiness could keep agreements, whose integrity could govern the distribution of wealth,\nWhose actions were lawful, whose words were proper—such a person was **Jié** (杰);\n\nOne who fulfilled their duties without neglect, who adhered to righteousness without forming factions,\nWho did not evade difficulties and did not seek unjust gain—such a person was **Háo** (豪).\n\nThe **Yīng, Zhì, Jié,** and **Háo** were placed in their respective positions according to their talents—from root to branch, from heavy to light—with the ruler leading and the people responding in harmony. Within the four seas, all hearts turned in unison, abandoning greed and vulgarity, turning toward benevolence and righteousness. In transforming the people, their influence was like the wind sweeping through the grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy rule over the worthy, even severe punishments cannot restrain their deceit.\n\nThe small cannot control the great, the weak cannot command the strong—this is the nature of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the sages selected the worthy to establish merit, while unworthy rulers elevated their like-minded allies. By observing whom they promote, one can discern whether a state is orderly or chaotic. By examining their factions, one can judge whether they are worthy or unworthy.\n\nIn ancient times, the method of selecting officials ranked **moral cultivation and virtue** highest, followed by **benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music**, then **writing, arithmetic, and laws**. Only then did they consider **wisdom**. Was this not the method of the **Warring States**?\n\nThe principles of governance are such that the small cannot control the great, and the weak cannot control the strong. If one relies on **balancing scales and sealed debates**, even severe punishments cannot restrain deceit.\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said:\nThose who establish ritual carve and polish human nature, forcing and restraining its spontaneity. Though the eyes desire something, ritual restrains its measure. Though the heart takes pleasure, ritual restricts it with propriety. Moving, circling, bowing, and scraping—limbs stiffen though they do not eat, wine settles though they do not drink. Externally, the body is bound; internally, the mind is troubled. The harmony of yin and yang is suppressed, and the essence of life is strained. Thus, one spends their life as a sorrowful being.\n\nWhy? Because they do not address the root of desire but only restrain its expression. They do not explore the source of joy but only prevent its indulgence. This is like caging a wild beast without blocking its path, or damning a river’s flow with one’s hands. Therefore, it is said:\n*\"Open the mouth of the flood, complete the task—yet the life will never be saved.\"*\n\nRitual does not eliminate desire but restrains it.\nMusic does not eliminate joy but regulates it.\n\nRitual is the standard for self-discipline and the tool to prevent vice—it is the universal path of the world.\n\nAs **Yánzǐ**’s gaze, hearing, speech, and movement adhered to ritual, keeping his heart in harmony with it, then the improper could not enter.\n\nThe proper use of ritual values **harmony** above all.\nWhen a gentleman’s heart is full, ritual is sincere within and expressed without, naturally harmonizing with Heaven and Earth. Human relationships become harmonious, yin and yang are balanced, and all things flourish.",

      "translated_text": "The ruler who makes all under Heaven fear punishment so that none dare steal—\nhow much better it would be to eliminate the very desire to steal!\n\nThus, when the use of something is known, even the greedy will decline it;\nwhen its uselessness is unknown, even the virtuous cannot relinquish it.\n\nThe reason states perish, rulers die by others’ hands, and they become the laughingstock of the world—\nit is never because of anything other than desire.\n\nIf one knows that a fan in winter and a fur in summer serve no purpose,\nthen all things would be reduced to dust and filth.\n\nThus, to stop boiling by skimming the foam only makes it worse—\none must remove the fire at its source.\n\nThe difficulty of governing theft has long persisted.\nSteal a hook and you are executed; steal a kingdom and you become a feudal lord.\nThus, theft lies with the ruler, not the commoner.\n\nIf, like Yao, one’s thatched hut is left untrimmed and unhewn timber uncarved,\neven rewards would not tempt theft.\n\nTo topple palaces of jade and gold, to ruin the halls of the tyrants—\nthe fate of Jie and Zhou—\ntheir bodies torn apart by others, alas!\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"To act in accordance with one’s nature is called the Dao;\nto attain one’s innate nature is called virtue.*\n\nWhen nature is lost, then benevolence is prized;\nwhen the Dao is lost, then righteousness is prized.\nOnce benevolence and righteousness are established, virtue and the Dao decay.\nWhen purity and simplicity scatter, ritual and music become ornate;\nwhen distinctions of right and wrong take form, the people are bewildered;\nwhen jade and pearls are treasured, the world falls into contention.\n\nRitual serves to distinguish the noble from the base, the high from the low;\nrighteousness harmonizes the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son,\nbrothers, husband and wife—the proper order of human affairs.\n\nIn the decadent age, ritual becomes mere formality, and acts of courtesy are called ‘righteousness’\nfor the sake of gain, while lords and ministers denounce one another,\nand kin harbor grudges.\n\nThus, stagnant water breeds cannibalistic creatures,\ndecaying earth spawns self-devouring beasts—\nornate ritual and music give rise to deceit and falsehood.\n\nNo thing, in its use, endures without eventually decaying.\nThough the Dao may be followed and virtue attained,\nif the time is not right, it cannot be practiced.\n\nEven when lords and ministers uphold righteousness,\nthey cannot escape mutual reproach;\nwhen parents and children rely on affection,\nthey may still breed resentment.\n\nIs this not the fixed nature of human hearts?\n\nIn the decadent age, governance does not accumulate the means of sustenance,\nbut instead corrupts the purity of the people, scatters their simplicity,\nconfuses the masses, and inverts clarity for filth.\nLife and essence scatter in chaos, all for the sake of greed.\nSincerity and trust decay into arrogance and negligence,\nand people lose their true nature.\nLaw and righteousness diverge, conduct and self-interest oppose one another,\nwhile the rich and poor scheme against each other—\neven the ruler and his servants are beyond comparison.\n\nWhen one has excess, one should yield;\nwhen one lacks, one contends.\nYielding gives rise to ritual and righteousness;\ncontention spawns violence and disorder.\nThus, excessive desire leads to unchecked actions,\nand insatiable greed fuels endless strife.\n\nTherefore, in an age of order, the petty man adheres to propriety\nand cannot be enticed by profit;\nin an age of chaos, the noble resorts to deceit\nand cannot be restrained by law.\n\nFood is essential to life—\none day without it brings hunger,\nthree days brings sickness,\nseven days brings death.\n\nIn ancient times, states stored ten years’ worth of grain,\nand thus could endure nine years of flood and seven years of drought\nwithout the people starving.\n\nBut in the decadent age, governance does not accumulate the means of sustenance—\nfor rulers, consumed by desire, cannot curb their actions.\nWhen the ruler lacks provision, he must take from below;\nwhen the people lack sustenance, they must contend for survival.\nHow grave is this hunger!\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"In a declining age, the ruler drills through mountains for ore,\nplucks gold and jade like fruit,\nharvests pearls and shells,\nmelts copper and iron—\nyet all things wither and fail to flourish.\n\nHe flays the pregnant, burns the sacrificial grounds,\ndestroys nests and ruins states—\nthe phoenix will not alight, the qilin will not roam.\nHe builds wooden towers, burns forests for hunting,\ndrains ponds for fishing, piles earth to make mounds,\ndug wells to drink from, dredges rivers to make pools,\nfortifies cities as strongholds, imprisons beasts for sport—\nand thus yin and yang are disrupted, the four seasons fall out of order.\nThunder and lightning are shattered, hail and frost bring ruin,\nten thousand things wither and die prematurely.\nHalf the crops fail, grasses and trees wither in summer,\nthe three great rivers run dry and cease to flow.\n\nHe demarcates mountains and rivers, setting boundaries,\ncounts the people, assigning quotas,\ndevises traps and ambushes as defenses,\nregulates clothing and colors, ranks the noble and base,\ndistinguishes the worthy from the unworthy,\nand enforces rewards and punishments—\nand thus war arises, and resentment spreads.\nThe innocent are slaughtered, the guilty go unpunished—\nthis is how calamity begins.\n\nThose who are full yet know not to stop\nare condemned by Heaven, Earth, and the spirits.\n\nWhen yin and yang are disrupted, the four seasons fall out of order,\nthunder and lightning are shattered, hail and frost bring ruin,\nten thousand things wither and die prematurely,\nand the rivers run dry—\nthese are the consequences of excess, the transformation of excess,\nand the harm of excess.\n\nIf one cannot correct these errors,\nthen human misfortune from excess follows.\n\nThis is indeed something to fear.\n\nLaozi said:\n*'When the world is about to lose its nature and essence,\nit is like the rise of yin energy—\nthe ruler is dim-witted and unclear,\nthe Dao is abandoned and not practiced,\nvirtue is extinguished and not upheld.\nActions defy Heaven, decrees contradict the seasons.\nSpring and autumn shrink from harmony,\nHeaven and Earth withdraw their blessings,\nthe ruler sits uneasily in his position,\nthe ministers withdraw in seclusion and remain silent,\nthe officials follow the ruler’s whims and abandon tradition,\nthey alienate their kin while flattering themselves,\nflatterers scheme in secret, mimicking the ruler’s chaos,\nand the people complete their ruin.\nThus, the ruler and minister grow estranged and untrusting,\nkin become distant and unfaithful,\nfields yield no grain, roads are deserted,\ntreasures lose their luster, jade becomes worthless,\ntortoiseshells have no inner markings, divination fails daily,\nand though the world is one in name, it is not truly united.\n\nThe feudal lords enact laws that differ in every state,\ncustoms become perverse,\nroots are uprooted, foundations abandoned,\nthe Five Punishments are sharpened into cruelty,\nthey quarrel over trifles while slaughtering half the people,\nraise armies for war, assault cities, and massacre indiscriminately,\noverturning the high to secure the low, deploying massive chariots,\nbuilding towering ramparts, clearing battlefields,\nforcing soldiers into death traps,\nclashing with stern enemies time and again—\ntheir fame may swell, their conquests vast,\nbut the dead pile up by the tens of thousands,\nand the old and weak perish in hunger and cold beyond count.'\"",
