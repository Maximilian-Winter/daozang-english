  "full_translation": "**Preface to the Essential Teachings of the *Elixir Canon of Master Yuxi* (Volume One)**\n\nMy ancestral home lies east of the prefectural city of Yichun. My distant forebear, the Court Discussant of the Observatory, retired to cultivate the Dao and styled himself the Old Man of Wangxi (now, great clans no longer invoke their ancestral prefectures but simply call themselves \"Yu Huo\").\n\nTwice he encountered the Perfected One of Pure Yang yet failed to awaken.\n(First beneath the pines of Yue Mountain; again on a moonlit night at Yueyang Tower, where he heard the sound of a flute.)\n\nLater, while traveling to Mount Nanyue to seek Lan Yangsu, he met a man on the road carrying tools for nails and hinges. The man addressed him: \"Are you not Master Li? Are you going to Yue Mountain to see Yangsu?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"Indeed.\"\n\nThe man said, \"Then I beg you to deliver a message to Lan: 'The Recluse Liu inquires of the Master—how does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?'\"\n\nWith that, he made a deep bow and departed.\n\nThe Master walked several *li*, troubled and disquieted. He reflected: *This man knew my name, discerned my purpose, and his words were unlike those of the common world.* He sought him again but could not find him.\n\nUpon meeting Lan, he recounted all that had been said.\n\nLan asked, \"Is there not a white mole between your brows?\"\nThe Master replied, \"There is.\"\nLan said, \"This was Liu Haichan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo, and none but he could verify its fruition. Pray, repeat his words to me.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"The Recluse Liu inquires of the Master—how does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?\"\n\nLan clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Suddenly, a rumbling like thunder resounded from his crown, and a figure radiant as snow and moonlight—indistinguishable from Lan—ascended straight into the heavens. Lan had already departed.\n\nThe Master burned incense, sighed, and withdrew. This was the \"Long-Laughing Master of Yue Mountain.\" (See *Records of Marvelous Encounters in Our Family* and *Gazetteer of Yichun*.)\n\nUpon returning home, the Master gathered hagiographies of immortals, Daoist scriptures, and various philosophical texts, shut his door to visitors, and pored over them by day. Before long, he too passed away without illness. (His *Xian’guan Collection* circulates in the world.)\n\nI am his descendant. Though I studied the Confucian classics in youth, my aspirations were unfulfilled. Yet in the canons of Daoism and Buddhism, the classics of astrology, music, medicine, and divination, I explored all without exception. My heart, however, was especially devoted to the single secret of the Golden Elixir. Thus, I traversed rivers and lakes, journeyed across mountains and plains, and even bowed to beggars to seek their instruction. My resolve unwavering, heaven guided my heart.\n\nI encountered a perfected one within the Gui Xian precinct at the Temple of Prince Wang, and later met him again in Jiangling Prefecture. A single word from him illumined the principles of the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions. I once sojourned in Wudang, Xiangyang, the Han River, the Jiang and Huai regions—no place I did not visit. Yet few among them were enlightened, discerning masters of the subtle mechanism. Thus, I sealed my lips and spoke not a word of the Mystery.\n\nBy the *guihai* year of the Jingding era (1263, Southern Song, Emperor Lizong), I had traveled from Jingxiang to Xingcha, not far from Languan. There, I met someone from my hometown. In conversation, I inquired after old acquaintances, only to find the strong now aged and the aged passed away. Unbidden, tears flowed.\n\nI reflected: As the Perfected One of Ziyang said, \"To plan for oneself is gain, but to begrudge the Dao is the greatest transgression.\" Thereupon, I opened my heart in prayer to heaven, unlocking the Golden Gate and Jade Key. Compiling these, I wrote the *Essential Pointers to the Wuzhen Pian*, the *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*, and the *Treatise on Dispelling Delusion*. For those who asked about the teachings, fearing the symbols and images were not exhaustive, I further expounded the functions of the Primordial Sovereign to clarify the advance and retreat of talismanic fire—this may be said to reveal the celestial mechanism.\n\nThose who aspire to the Way must treasure what they have attained. Let each cultivate and each achieve perfection; when merit is complete and virtue perfected, all shall together verify the fruit of immortality. Should one grow careless, calamity will swiftly manifest. Though my words are coarse and unrefined, they contain nothing beyond the practical matters of the inner chamber. Gentlemen devoted to the Way should ponder them carefully. If enlightenment comes, it is heaven’s gift—not from the paltry transmission of my lips.\n\nIn the fourth month of the cyclical year *jiazi* in the fifth year of the Jingding reign (1264), during the full moon.\n\n*Preface by Li Jianyi, the Master of Yuxi of Yichun.*\n\n**Essential Pointers on the Alchemical Canon, Volume One**\n*Compiled by Li Jianyi, the Master of Yuxi*\n\n---\n\n**The Conjunction Diagram**\nDependent on the *kun* position’s generative body,\nSown in the *qian* house’s chamber of intercourse.\nOne man and one woman form heaven and earth,\nThree boys and three girls share a common end.\nThe elixir lies in the southwest—its native land,\nWhere the toad’s light shines all day on the Western River.\n\n*Diagram omitted.*\n\n---\n\n**The Three-Five-One Diagram**\nThree, five, and one—three characters,\nRare indeed are those who understand them through the ages.\nEast’s three and south’s two together make five,\nNorth’s one and west’s four complete the sum.\n*Wu* and *ji* naturally reside in the generative number five,\nWhen the three families meet, the infant is conceived.\nThe infant is the one containing true *qi*,\nAfter ten months in the womb, it enters the sacred foundation.\n\nThe mind-horse returns to the spirit-chamber,\nSwiftly forming the three natures.\nThe heart-ape guards the grotto-room,\nWhere spirit and essence harmonize with the five phases.\nSpirit, essence, soul, and intent—\nHere the four images are distinguished.\nThey become the purple gold frost,\nGathered to form the fetal infant.\n\n*Diagram omitted.*\n\n---\n\n**I. Nine Returns and Seven Reversions**\n\"Returns\" and \"reversions\" denote the principle of inversion—\nThey are but the reckoning of metal and fire.\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Seven reversions: cinnabar returns to its root,\nNine returns: golden liquid reverts to truth.\nDo not fixate on the reckoning of yin and yang,\nBut observe the five phases as the standard.*\n\nMetal’s number is four; multiplied by earth, it becomes nine returns.\nFire’s number is two; multiplied by earth, it becomes seven reversions.\nWhat the *Cantong Qi* calls \"the secret in lead and fire\"\nIs the golden elixir—\nThe golden elixir is the divine water of the flower pool.\nThe *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:\n*In alchemy, nothing is more luminous than metal and fire.*\nAnd again:\n*The spirit-chamber refines its essence,\nFire and metal mutually propel.\nThe male yang is the azure water,\nThe female yin is the ochre gold.*\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*Pound and blend them together,\nHold them and enter the vermilion gate.\nThe secret lies therein!*\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*The White Tiger’s primary scripture is the supreme treasure,\nThe flower pool’s divine water is true gold.*\nNow, pointing directly to clarify—\nMay it open the path to awakening.\n\nMetal is true lead;\nFire is divine mercury.\nTrue lead is the *qi* of the prior heavens,\nBorn from the kidneys—\nThus the alchemical canon says:\n*How sublime! True lead,\nPreceding heaven and earth.*\nDivine mercury is the truth within nature,\nIssuing from the heart.\nThe *qi* within the kidneys conceals true water,\nThe truth within nature stores true fire.\nMaster Shi said:\n*Take the medicine from the prior-heaven qi,\nSeek fire in the essence of the great yang.\nKnowing how to take the medicine and seek fire,\nYou will surely succeed in making the elixir.*\nWithout true earth, they cannot unite—\nThus the return and reversion of metal and fire\nAre the utmost essentials of the inner elixir.\nSeek them within the body;\nApart from this, all else is not the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**II. The Crucible**\nThe crucible is the yang furnace and yin tripod,\nThe jade furnace and golden tripod.\nIt is also called the spirit-chamber,\nThe upper and lower cauldrons,\nThe yellow chamber,\nThe recumbent moon furnace,\nThe enclosure of *kan* and *li*,\nOr the single aperture of the mysterious pass—\nIts alternate names are too numerous to list.\nThis is the pivot of the returning elixir,\nThe treasury where spirit and *qi* return and are stored.\n\nIn truth, there are two:\nOne is the inner crucible and spirit-furnace,\nThe other is the outer crucible and its symbolic form.\nAt the body’s vertical center, above and below,\nFacing the navel in front and the kidneys behind—\nLead and mercury converge,\nA single point alights within.\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies,\nRely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.\nOnce true essence returns to the golden chamber,\nA luminous pearl will never depart.*\nThis is what is meant by \"establishing the foundation for a hundred days.\"\n\nThe outer crucible and its symbolic form\nTake their model from yin and yang:\nWater above, fire below,\nMarking the crescent, full, waning, and new moons,\nAligning with the eight trigrams and four seasons,\nDrilling and gathering the five phases,\nHarmonizing the four images,\nRefining dragon and tiger,\nRestraining soul and spirit—\nInner and outer correspond,\nInversion and ascent-descent proceed.\nHeaven and earth serve as father and mother,\n*Kan* and *li* as husband and wife.\nDividing the 384 lines,\nCirculating the fire-times;\nMoving the five stars and twenty-eight constellations,\nArranging them within the crucible.\nSealing and fortifying the embankments,\nPrecise to the instant.\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*First take heaven and earth as the crucible,\nThen gather the sun and moon to cook the medicine.\nOnce you drive the two things into the Yellow Path,\nHow could the golden elixir fail to form?*\nAnother verse says:\n*The *Cantong Qi* speaks of tending the capital’s outskirts,\nCongealing spirit to form the body.*\nAnd again:\n*The true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nFloating and roaming within the compass’s bounds.*\nThis is the single aperture of the mysterious pass.\n\nThe inner and outer crucibles and their symbolic forms\nAre clearly revealed.\nIf you seek further outside,\nOr indulge in passions, desires, and delusions,\nAttempting to fabricate in the realm of form—\nYou will be separated by a thousand miles!\n\n---\n\n**III. True Lead**\nTrue lead is the *kan* male,\nThe infant,\nThe moon’s essence,\nThe yin tiger,\nThe metal duke,\nLead within silver,\nWhite within black,\nYang within yin—\nIts alternate names are many.\nCalled true lead,\nIt is in truth the single *qi* of the prior heavens,\nGathered before the Great Simplicity.\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Simply capture the earth’s essence to subdue the vermilion mercury.*\nIt meets true mercury to form the elixir,\nAnd is restrained by true earth to unite.\n\n---\n\n**IV. True Mercury**\nTrue mercury is the *li* female,\nThe sun’s spirit,\nThe radiant maiden,\nThe yang dragon,\nMercury within cinnabar,\nThe female within the male,\nYin within yang—\nIts alternate names are many.\nCalled true mercury,\nIt is merely the liquid of wood.\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Of itself, the heaven’s spirit restrains the water-metal.*\nIt meets true lead to form the elixir,\nAnd is restrained by true earth to unite.\n\n---\n\n**V. True Earth**\nTrue earth is *wu* and *ji*,\nThe central palace,\nThe *kun* palace—\nIt is not the spleen.\nWhen lead meets mercury,\nWithout true earth, they cannot fuse and congeal.\nWielding the sword and laying down the halberd,\nIt governs the four directions.\n\n**The *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:**\nThe four seas converge like spokes to a hub, establishing great peace—all through the virtue of earth in the central palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor.\n*The Covenant* says: \"The three things of one household all return to *wu* and *ji*.\"\nMaster Ziyang said: \"This is to send them back to the earthen cauldron, firmly sealed.\"\nAs the linchpin of metal, wood, water, and fire, the work of the Five Phases is complete!\n\n**I. The Knife-Tip (Dao Gui)**\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*If *li* and *kan* lack *wu* and *ji*,\nThough they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form.\nFor only when each embraces true earth\nCan the golden elixir return and restore.*\n\nMaster Yuzhen said: \"The great medicine never departs from true *wu* and *ji*—hence the immortals call it *one knife-tip*.\"\nThe *knife* is a metaphor for metal; the *tip* (gui), for the two earths. To *drink the knife-tip* is to flow *wu* into *ji*.\nMaster Shizhen said: \"When you know how lead and mercury unite, you may drink the knife-tip.\"\n*The Restoration of Life* says:\n*The dragon and tiger, once entwined, gaze longingly,\n*Kan* and *li*, now cleansed, conceive the embryo.\nA single handful of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nSeek it with intent, and seize it when it comes.*\nThis is to drink the knife-tip in that very moment.\n\n**II. The Matchmaker**\nThe *matchmaker* is a metaphor for union. When lead is cast to meet mercury, without a matchmaker, it cannot be done—this is the Yellow Dame.\n(It is not the spleen.)\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*If true lead is to retain mercury,\nThe sovereign must not depart from his ministers.\nWood and metal, though estranged, meet by no cause—\nOnly the matchmaker’s allure can bridge them.*\nThis, too, is the principle of flowing *wu* into *ji*.\n\n**III. Gathering and Harvesting**\n*Gathering* is to gather without gathering; *harvesting*, to harvest without harvesting.\nIt cannot be sought with intention, nor obtained without it.\nMaster Shao said:\n*At winter solstice, midnight’s half,\nThe heart of heaven never shifts.\nWhere the first yang stirs,\nBefore the ten thousand things arise—\nAll begins here, the place of action.*\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: \"The Dao of *qian* becomes male; the Dao of *kun* becomes female.\"\nThus, at sixteen, a man’s true essence is full, corresponding to *qian*; at fourteen, a woman’s celestial water descends, corresponding to *kun*.\n*Qian* embraces *jia* and *ren*; *kun* embraces *yi* and *gui*—creation has its origins here!\nMaster Ziyang said: \"When lead appears at *gui*, gather it swiftly.\"\nThis is the end of *kun* and the beginning of *fu*, before the primordial *qi* of *taiyi* manifests. Wait for the first yang to stir, then gather it urgently.\n\"Gold met at a distance is not worth tasting\"—lest the delicate blossom scatter carelessly.\nMaster Fuming the Chan Master said:\n*Gathering must be secret,\nThe heart sincere, discerning beauty from ugliness.\nThe thread of intent is hard to trace—\nA moment’s ease, and the cold spring is lost.*\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Tap the bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom,\nPluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife-tip.*\nThis is the pivotal mechanism of drawing lead into the crucible—it is not the art of \"refining metal with the jade woman.\"\n\n**IV. Fusion and Coagulation**\nAn ancient song says:\n*The sun is *li*, the moon is *kan*—\nTheir essences devour each other.*\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Both things are born of the child producing the mother,\nThe Five Phases must all enter the central palace.*\nThis is the union of the five stars in a string, the sun and moon as one disk.\nThe later Master Ma Danyang said:\n*Fire arises in water—banish the heart’s scenery,\nFlowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of intent.*\nSuch is the vision at the time of fusion and coagulation.\nLet those who study the Dao savor this deeply!\n\n**V. Steaming and Refining**\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*Below lies the *qi* of the great yang,\nSteaming and seething in an instant.*\nAnd:\n*Rising and roasting on the mountain of rice,\nThe blazing fire is set below.*\nAnd:\n*A clamor of voices, so mournful,\nLike an infant longing for its mother.*\nAnd:\n*When *yinghuo* guards the west and *taibai* crosses the sky,\nThe killing *qi* descends—what can stand unshaken?\nThe fox and dog guard the rat; the crow and sparrow fear the crane.*\n*The Restoration of Life* says:\n*Seize the essence and marrow of the crow and hare,\nHasten to gather and refine them in the crucible.*\n\nAn ancient song says:\n*The divine fire steams the lead’s *qi* away by night,\nThe old turtle swallows the soul of *Zhurong*.*\nThis is the natural principle of steaming and refining. Those who do not understand creation should not lightly discuss it.\n\n**VI. The Union of Metal and Wood**\nMetal is the nature of lead; wood, the nature of mercury. In the profound and indistinct, they defy description.\nMetal within the body is firm, strong, and pure, coursing through the four limbs—this is metal’s true nature, not the nature of desire.\nWood within the interior is soft, yielding, and compassionate, like sweating at the croak of a frog—this is wood’s true nature, the very root of benevolence.\nMetal’s nature, nurtured by lead, becomes supple; wood’s nature, congealed by mercury, becomes dense. When lead and mercury meet, their natures intertwine in mutual longing.\nMaster Zhenyi said: \"The male’s nature and the female’s essence, each needing the other, embrace and exhale, gathering and generating, transforming into true essence to become the divine medicine.\"\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s nature yearns for wood’s kindness.\nDevouring each other, yet growing closer,\nOnly then does the man conceive.*\n*The Covenant* says: \"When metal returns to its original nature, it is called the returning elixir.\"\nAnd: \"Metal fells, wood flourishes.\"\nWithout the matchmaker’s harmony, there would be the peril of estrangement!\n\n**VII. The Clarity and Turbidity of the Water’s Source**\nThe *water’s source* is a metaphor for the heart’s source, the sea of nature. When the dragon coils and the tiger crouches, clouds disperse and mists clear—then the waves of the sea of desire are stilled, the billows of the river of love are calmed. In stillness, heaven and earth are vast; in leisure, the sun and moon are long.\nWhether turbid or clear, you will see it in that moment.\n\n**VIII. Warm Nurturing**\n\nEliminate passions and dispel desires, withdraw sight and return hearing, cast off the limbs, dull the senses, and remain foolish all day—never depart from this for even a moment. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, let no interruption occur; like a hen brooding her eggs, let the warmth never cease. Laozi said: *\"Concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\"* And again: *\"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.\"* The secret says: *\"Forget the form to nourish the qi, forget the qi to nourish the spirit, forget the spirit to nourish the void.\"* The true person guards the center of the compass, and the qi is like spring within the blossoms. When the seasonal cycle is complete, the embryo sheds its shell, and the spirit transforms.\n\n**Fire and Timing**\nFire is the fire of spirit; timing is the alignment of signs. Model the cauldron and furnace upon heaven and earth, use yang as charcoal, yin as water, and let the sun and moon revolve—one cold, one hot. The central sovereign issues commands, carefully harmonizing and blending. For the numinous medicine is formless yet subtly follows the mechanism of transformation, ascending and descending in reversal. Master Cao said: *\"When the qi of Li is reached in a hundred moments, cinnabar emerges from it.\"* There are rhythms of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, bathing—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, regret and misfortune arise at once. Master Ziyang said: *\"Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire and timing, it is as idle as leisure. All depends on the power of maintenance—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir will not form.\"* This matter belongs to the celestial mechanism and brooks no careless discussion; its general meaning is already evident in the Fuxi’s workings. The wise and discerning, by daily reflection, will naturally awaken.\n\nOf old, the Most High Lord Lao transmitted the *\"Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire and Timing of the Golden Elixir,\"* which are respectfully recorded here:\n\nThe sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nTheir hexagrammic cycles are most clearly marked.\n(From Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning, like a linked ring)\nThree and five before, three and five after—\n(The waxing and waning crescents)\nFive and six make thirty, returning to life—\n(The lunar nodes of a month)\nLife and death cycle through twelve—\n(The solar terms of a year)\nTwelve divided into twenty-four.\n(The twenty-four solar terms completing a year’s fire and timing)\nThe twenty-four terms mutually shift and change,\n(Revolving without end)\nAll phenomena, every ounce and grain, lie herein.\nMercury, one substance, divides into two,\nTransforming into yin and yang, becoming *jwei* and *wei*.\n*Jwei* and *wei* then unite as husband and wife,\nAnd one perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.\n\nThis song-verse was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Most High, revealing the subtlest principles of medicinal substances and fire-timing. It is decreed that later learners of the Dao should treat it with reverence. If any should slight or disdain it, calamity will swiftly follow—everywhere, at all times, there are divine spirits! One cannot be too cautious.\n\nMaster Pure Yang’s postscript says: *\"Great indeed are the twelve verses, harmonizing with the Five Thousand Words.\"*\n\n**Bathing**\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: *\"In the second month, the elm dies; in the eighth month, the wheat sprouts. When punishment and virtue stand at the gate, beware of peril.\"* Master Ziyang said: *\"In the months of the hare and the rooster, when the time arrives and the signs of punishment and virtue approach, this is when the golden cinnabar should be bathed. If fire is added instead, danger will surely overturn it.\"* Thus, at the hours of Mao and You, one should bathe to balance it, refraining from advancing the fire.\n\n**Shedding the Embryo**\nGradually grow larger, gradually grow more numinous, gradually come to completion. Master Ziyang said: *\"A fruit ripens on the branch in due time—how is the child in the womb any different?\"* Master Yunfang said: *\"The child is young and not yet fully formed; it must rely on the nurturing kindness of father and mother. After nine years and three years, when human affairs are exhausted, it will roam heaven and earth without dependence on kin.\"* Looking back at the old body, it is but a heap of dung and earth. When merit is complete and the fruit is full, one ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign. This may be called *\"form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\"* The *\"Song of Breaking Delusion\"* by the Most Supreme Perfected says:\n\nA fish by the roadside still flicks its red tail—\nif you would save it, swiftly return it to the depths.\nA man you meet upon the path, his life near spent—\nif you would save him, swiftly teach him the Way’s principle.\n\nByways and minor arts branch in a thousand, ten thousand strands,\nbut the true Dao’s work is not so vast—it lies within oneself alone.\nTo spare the lost from delusion, I briefly name one or two:\n\nCirculating qi is not the Dao—\nbreath and pulse grow disordered.\nSwallowing saliva is not the Dao—\nspittle is not the water of spirit.\n\nVisualization is not the Dao—\npainting cakes cannot serve as food.\nAbsorbing yin is not the Dao—\nessence exhausted, life follows in death.\nAvoiding salt is not the Dao—\nfood loses all savor.\nFasting is not the Dao—\nhunger and weakness harm the stomach and bowels.\nAbandoning one’s wife is not the Dao—\nyin and yang lose their proper place.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao?\nThe Great One holds true qi,\nqi intermingling yet not intermingling,\nascending and descending in emulation of heaven and earth.\nTwo things pair and unite,\narising from the Primal Beginning—\nthe marvelous maiden and the infant boy,\nmatched to achieve the Completed Success.\nThese are true yin and true yang,\nhusband and wife sharing one meaning.\nThus there is no need to abandon—\nhow can solitary yang accomplish anything?\n\nTo proclaim oneself an immortal—\nis the golden elixir so easily attained?\nThe steadfast scholar does not speak plainly,\nfor the Great Cavern holds profound meaning.\n\nThe five phases do not proceed in order—\nthe tiger is born within water.\nThe five phases’ inverted art—\nthe dragon emerges from fire.\nThese words are truly wondrous—\nsuch is the power of the Great One.\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*\"Abandoning one’s wife needlessly severs yin and yang;\nfasting merely leaves the stomach and bowels empty.\"*\nThese lines quote the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Most Supreme Perfected.\nFasting is not the ultimate Dao,\nbut the teaching on abandoning one’s wife holds profound truth.\n\nNowadays, those bound for hell,\nupon seeing Ziyang’s words,\nimmediately misconstrue them as the \"Three Peaks of Golden Flower\" arts of bedchamber yoga,\nadding reckless annotations to mislead later generations,\ndragging scholars and gentlemen into hell.\nLittle do they know that the intent of the Most Supreme Perfected and Master Ziyang\nconcerns the union of true yin and true yang within the body.\nThus the *Cantong qi* says:\n*\"The male does not dwell alone,\nthe female does not live in solitude.\"*\nAnd further:\n*\"Things without yin and yang defy heaven and betray the origin;\na rooster hatching eggs alone will not produce whole chicks.\"*\nMaster Yunfang said:\n*\"Do not claim this body is wholly the Dao—\ncultivating a single element is but solitary yin.\"*\nBai Yuchan said:\n*\"Within one’s own body lies husband and wife—\nto speak of this to others is to invite mockery.\"*\nThis is the meaning.\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*\"If you can seek the inverted in daily use,\nthe sands of the earth all become treasure.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you can turn this mechanism of life and death,\ndisaster transforms to fortune in the palm of your hand.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"I urge you: in battle, do not underestimate the foe,\nlest you lose our priceless treasure.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,\nyou will know how harm gives rise to kindness.\"*\nLater, he admonished:\n*\"If you have not refined the elixir, refine it swiftly;\nonce refined, know when to stop.\nIf you persist in grasping without restraint,\nyou will one day meet with ruin and disgrace.\"*\nThis discourse guards against danger and considers peril—\nit concerns the mechanism of reversal.\nIf the mind of lust is not extinguished and the fire of desire burns below,\nthe great treasure will be lost, the foundation of life will crumble.\nWhen that time comes, how can regret avail?\n\nI reiterate this to warn those who study the Dao,\nhoping all will follow the true path and together ascend the immortal ranks,\nguiding those who come after,\nlest one blind man lead another blind.\n\nThe *Song of Flowing Pearls* by Immortal Ge Xixi says:\n*Flowing pearls, flowing pearls,\ncast to me in my smallness.\nWandering the four seas,\nperusing ten thousand books.\nEndlessly striving, forgetting sleep and meals,\nconsulting all friends, burning cinnabar to exhaustion.\nFor thirty years, sighing daily,\nnow at sixty, I fear descending the three woeful paths.\nThanks to my teacher’s transmission—\nthe primal qi of emptiness and nothingness.\nFirst stabilize the golden crucible,\nthen establish the jade furnace.\nThe fire of Li excites,\nthe water of Kan takes form.\nJade liquid irrigates,\nthe chamber of mystery flows with butter.\nThe Perfected One delivers me—\nonly a great man can do so.\nHold this in mind, remember this—\nentrust it to my record.*\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the ancients’ diligent study of the Dao\ninevitably met with the guidance of a perfected being.\n\nThe path of internal elixir refinement\nemploys no more than the two substances, lead and mercury.\nFirst cultivate the human Dao,\nwith loyalty and filial piety as the foundation,\naiding others as the priority.\nTreasure this one body,\ncultivating inner work and outer conduct,\neliminating desires, calming the mind and qi,\nmoderating diet, reducing sleep.\nThe supreme medicines within the body are essence, qi, and spirit—\nif essence is not recklessly discharged, primordial qi blends harmoniously;\nif primordial qi blends harmoniously, primordial spirit rests at ease.\nWhen these three are firm, the crucible gradually takes shape.\nOnly when the crucible is complete can one speak of refinement.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What does it mean that 'following the sequence gives birth to humans, reversing it becomes the mother of the elixir'?\"*\nI replied: *\"Following the sequence is the great principle of human relations—\nessence and qi divide to form humans.\nEssence and qi become things, wandering souls undergo transformation.\nWith a body comes suffering, and afflictions arise from this.\nReversal inverts the five phases, harmonizes the four images,\ngathers the qi of undivided primordial chaos,\nseizes the essence of the dragon and tiger’s first union,\nenters the yellow chamber, and produces the supreme treasure.\nThis may be called 'formless giving rise to form, a body beyond the body.'\nWhen merit is complete and virtue perfected, one attains the rank of superior immortal!\"*\n\n**Essential Pointers from the Jade Creek’s Elixir Canon, Scroll Three**\n*Zhang Ziyang’s Song for Daoist Liu of White Dragon Cavern*\n\nHare runs, crow flies—both luminaries rush,\nfirst I hear flowers bloom, then autumn frost descends.\nVainly boast of a thousand years of wealth and longevity—\nit is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.\nA lightning flash—how fleeting!\nA hundred years, thirty-six thousand days,\nbetween them cold and heat alternately torment,\nunaware, the rosy face fades in darkness.\nEven with children and grandchildren before your eyes,\nall become bonds of love that entangle.\nWhen essence is exhausted and the body withers,\nwho can teach you to briefly halt and extend your days?\n\nTo briefly halt and extend—yet no means exist,\ninevitably the body follows the flowing waters.\nLook back at the sages and worthies of old—\nhow many knew the art of abiding in the world?\n\nTo abide in the world—there *is* a method,\nbut men of this age misjudge and stray.\nThey scramble into the mountains seeking herbs and trees,\nrefining lead, restraining mercury, concocting cinnabar.\n\nConcocting

excellent.\nDo not fault my words for their wild and coarse tone—\nit is only that men of this age are hard to discern.\nOnly when your heart aligns with mine\ndo I dare pour out my inmost thoughts to you.\n\nThe Kan and Kun bodies, the Li and Qian bodies:\nQian, with its yang, joins Kun to form Kan—\nthis is called “flowing Wu.”\nKun, with its yin, joins Qian to give rise to Li—\nthis is called “returning Ji.”\nAll things are conceived in the Zi hour,\nwhen Qian’s Ren and Kun’s Gui meet in the north—\nthus it is called the Kan palace,\nand the Kan palace is none other than the Kun palace.\nThe southwest is the native land,\nnot the Wei or Shen positions.\nThe primordial qi arises from this,\nand the crimson blood is the body’s single spark of yang essence,\nalso called “yang lead,”\ntruly the primordial qi of the prior heaven.\nThe scriptures say: “How sublime!\nTrue lead, born before heaven and earth—\nthis is the true lead.”\nThe Li position is the Qian palace.\nKnowing the season, gather this yang lead\nto subdue the yin essence of the Li position.\nYin essence is yin mercury,\nthe liquid of Wood.\nWhen these two substances unite,\nthey form the inner elixir—\nnot the cinnabar or mercury of the world,\nnor the five metals, eight stones, herbs, or trees of form.\n\nThe matching and blending follow their proper seasons.\nThe medicine’s flavor is mild, Metal and Water each half,\nwith Yellow Matron as the matchmaker,\nseeking the union of bride and groom—\nthe key lies in knowing the season.\n\nWhen the season is right, employ the matchmaker.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: “From the last day of the lunar month to the dawn of the new moon,\nZhen comes to receive the tally.”\nThis is the moment when the first yang stirs.\nAt this time, the female dragon hums,\nthe male tiger roars,\nand with the matchmaker’s aid, they naturally unite.\nThe matchmaker is Yellow Matron.\nAn ancient song says: “Three and four dwell together in one chamber,\none and two as husband and wife.\nOnly with a good matchmaker may they wed,\nand thus their bond grows ever closer.”\nZiyang says: “Originally relying on Wu and Ji as the matchmaker,\nthus husband and wife are ever joyfully united.”\nAnd again: “One must rely on the matchmaker’s guidance.”\nMaster Shi says: “Who knows the use?\nThe gist lies with Yellow Matron.”\nThus Yellow Matron is true Earth,\nand true Earth is Yellow Matron.\nWhen the male and female unite,\nhard and soft intertwine inseparably—\nnone but Yellow Matron can achieve this.\nShe is the pivot of the returning elixir,\nthe embankment of Metal and Water,\nthe Yellow Center that penetrates principle,\nrightly positioned within the body,\nher beauty dwelling within.\nYellow Matron, true Earth—\nher great outline is now clear!\n\nThe Metal Lord and the Maiden wed in marriage.\nThe Metal Lord and the Maiden—\nas explained below—\n“wed in marriage” means uniting lead and merging mercury.\nThe Metal Lord delights in riding the White Tiger:\nthe Metal Lord is lead,\nembracing the essence of Heaven’s One,\nborn from the moon and lodged in the west’s Geng and Xin Metal,\nemerging from the Kan position—\nthus it is said the Tiger is born from water,\nlead within silver,\nwhite within black,\nMetal within Water.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: “Metal is the mother of Water,\nthe mother conceals the child’s embryo.”\nWater is the child of Metal,\nthe child hidden in the mother’s womb.\nAnd again: “Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade,\noutwardly a madman.”\nThis is true lead,\ntruly the single qi of the prior heaven.\n\nThe Maiden ever mounts the Crimson Dragon’s form:\nthe Maiden is mercury,\nbearing the true yang’s qi,\nborn from the sun and lodged in the east’s Jia and Yi Wood,\nemerging from the Li palace—\nthus it is said the Dragon emerges from fire,\nmercury within cinnabar,\nthe female within the male,\nthe Great Yang’s flowing pearl.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: “Mercury is called the flowing pearl,\nthe Green Dragon accompanies it.”\nAnd the scriptures say: “Crimson marrow flows as mercury,\nthe Maiden plays with brightness.”\nThis is true mercury,\nthe liquid of Wood!\n\nThe Tiger comes to rest in the autumn river,\nthe Dragon stirs its body in the azure pool.\nThe autumn river is the west’s azure pool,\njust as the true Dragon of the eastern sea—\nwhen it sees the true Tiger, one rises as the other falls,\nboth coveting the other’s advantage.\nThe two beasts meet and battle in a single fray,\nwaves surging, seething like a boiling cauldron.\nAn ancient song says: “The Green Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger seeks the Dragon,\nthe Red Bird unites with cries of joy.”\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is the Dragon contending with the Tiger in battle—water surging, fire erupting, the cauldron seething and boiling over, their forces overturned and restrained, at times emitting the cries of an infant. The Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their numinous might; the True Man of Stone says: *\"The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair, Elder Ding’s heart is kind and merciful. Dragon and Tiger wage their war—how could the bound lord ever know?\"* The Yellow Dame was explained earlier; Elder Ding is the gentle fire.\n\nMaster Yin the True says: *\"I hold the Dao of the world, endless and boundless—yet I know only how to subdue the infant’s heart.\"* This is the true revelation of heaven’s secret. The shaking of heaven and earth startles gods and ghosts. An ancient song says: *\"The sage seizes the workings of creation, grasps sun and moon to place within the furnace. Gently stirring the essence of heaven and earth, he gathers yin and yang to rouse gods and ghosts.\"* Gods and ghosts are the celestial soul and earthly spirit.\n\nIn an instant, the battle ceases and the clouds disperse—clouds gather and rain scatters, all sounds return to silence, and within the palm, fortune is transformed. A mysterious pearl is planted in the mud’s depths. The *Fuming Pian* says: *\"At night, chaos falls to the earth—all the ten thousand images and signs know nothing of it.\"* This is the single drop descending into the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court is the central palace, the Yellow Chamber, the Mysterious Pass—likened to the mud’s depths.\n\nMaster Ziyang says: *\"Within one double-hour, the elixir is complete—this is the elixir’s daily accomplishment.\"* Day by day, it grows by a grain of millet, gradually forming the mysterious pearl. The Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl in the Red Waters—without the formless one, none could obtain it. This is that pearl; the formless one is without thought or care. From this, the root and sprout gradually mature. Constantly irrigated, it embraces true essence. Master Sanguzi says: *\"Establish the foundation for a hundred days, nurture it through the full cycle of stars. Simply guard the essence, tone, and spirit—water will naturally moisten, fire will naturally nurture, awaiting the qi’s fullness.\"*\n\nAfter ten months, the embryo is shed, and it is swallowed into the belly—suddenly, one senses the mortal body already imbued with spirit. Master Ziyang also says: *\"A single grain of numinous elixir is swallowed into the belly.\"* He speaks of *shedding the embryo* and *communing with the divine and sagely*. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and rain.\"* If this is the inner elixir, why does it speak of entering the belly, the mouth, the five viscera? Later generations doubted this and took it for an external elixir. Little did they know that *form arises from the formless*—this is what is called the Returned Elixir.\n\nTrue Master Unity speaks of first exploring the primal chaotic qi of heaven and earth to establish the root; then taking the essence of Qian and Kun, subtly moving its traces to form the model; following the numbers of Kan, Li, Pi, and Tai to determine punishment and virtue; stealing the mechanism of yin-yang’s transformations to complete winter and summer. Yin is born after noon, yang arises at midnight’s start—thus Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, the remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire times. Refining, nurturing, and subtly seizing the work of transformation—like fruit growing on a branch, the child within the womb, after ten months of fire times and qi’s fullness, suddenly sheds its spirit to enter the true embryo, uniting with heaven.\n\nThus it speaks of entering the mouth, the belly, the five viscera. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"It resembles a chicken’s egg, white and black aligned, a single inch in length and breadth, as the beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete. After ten months, it emerges from the womb.\"* This is *form arising from the formless*, a body beyond the body. Clinging to the old frame traps one in darkness; emerging from the ninth mud allows roaming heaven and earth. One’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, one’s title is True Man—this is the time when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.\n\nThis matter is rare in the world, not something ordinary people can know. If one lacks the immortal bones of past lives, how could one easily encounter it? Having encountered it, one should swiftly refine it—time flies like an arrow. To catch the fish, one must cast the net; do not stand by the abyss and sigh in vain. I hear you have known the medicine for many years—why not gather your heart and refine mercury and lead? Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind, for the six paths of rebirth leave no room for complaint.\n\nThese words admonish Immortal Liu, urging him to gather his heart and refine mercury and lead. From this, it is clear that the inner elixir must be refined within oneself—it is not a matter of external medicine. Recently, worldly people have grown cunning, competing to don Daoist robes and claim the Way. Ask them what metal and wood are—they fall silent, mute and ashamed.\n\nMetal and wood are explained in the *Essential Pointers*: *\"Without knowing this, one cannot speak of the Returned Elixir.\"* Yet they speak of breath cultivation and fasting, claiming other schools and doctrines are profound. Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*? *\"The Great One embraces true qi—this method is strongest.\"* The myriad minor side paths, though countless, have nothing to do with the Way of Golden Liquor and the Returned Inner Elixir. What is called the Dao? The Great One embracing true qi, the five stars aligning in a string, the sun and moon conjoining—this is how the inner elixir is formed, how the Dharma-body emerges. There is no second gate.\n\nDo not fault my words for their crudeness—it is only because the world lacks discernment. Only when your heart aligns with mine will I dare pour out my thoughts for you.\n\n---\n\n**Regulating the Center Diagram**\n*Preface to the Twelve-Character Formula of the Regulating the Center Diagram*\n\nThree thousand six hundred methods, dozens of schools for nurturing life—all are side paths, nothing but crooked trails. Take, for example, breath cultivation to inflate the empty belly, the *Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence*, absorbing and grinding to move the river chariot, holding the breath as fire times, inhaling the clear and exhaling the turbid, connecting to realms and lamenting flows, guiding the turtle and turning the perch, mirroring forms to seek liberation, storing the chimney, guarding the brow’s center—all are adding heads atop heads, stirring trouble where there is none, overturning order and deviating from the utmost truth.\n\nThus, the hundred vessels boil over, the three fields collapse into chaos. What was meant to grant eternal life instead harms it. This is truly going against the harmony of heaven and earth, failing to align with nature’s intent. After simplifying and studying the *Cantong Qi* for thirty years, I have grasped its mysteries. Drawing from the threads of the alchemical classics, I composed the *Twelve-Character Formula of the Regulating the Center Diagram* to transmit to those who study the Dao. It takes rectifying the heart and sincerely cultivating intention as its foundation, the central pillar—abiding in the center to govern the external.\n\nWith the eight characters as auxiliaries, one regulates and governs the four seasons, responding to the internal from the external. Above, it aligns with the heart of heaven; in the middle, it examines human affairs; silently, it accords with creation, following the course of yin and yang. Externally, it models the five phases; internally, it orders the five viscera—thus forming the endless cycle of daily use.\n\nIt does not rely on action, nor does it depend on visualization. Serenely, in great stillness, it unites the primal mechanism. One must only sever cravings, stabilize the heart and qi, reduce thoughts, moderate diet, regulate breath, guard against drowsiness, and restrain the senses—nurturing the harmony of heaven. Within the four dignified postures, one merges with nature, without any complexity or difficulty.\n\nFor those who have already established the *yinqie* (the alchemical crucible), this serves to harmonize with the firing process and nurture the sacred embryo. For those who have not yet established the *yinqie*, this strengthens the primal qi, nourishes the spirit, and serves as the gradual foundation for its establishment. As for depletion, loss, illness, and affliction, this method dispels sickness, fortifies the primal, and serves as the art of supplementation, longevity, and life-nurturing—truly the gateway of simplicity!\n\n**The Regulating the Center Diagram**\nTo \"regulate the center\" is to dwell within a compass, neither in the middle nor within or without—neither clinging to images nor attaching to things. It resides in the center of the body, the center of intention, like the self within a great mirror. Simply rectify the heart and sincerely cultivate intention as the central pillar. When all distractions vanish, the true person appears—like a fish in the deep abyss, swimming freely yet never leaving the square inch. This is the true person abiding in the profound depths, floating and guarding the regulated center.\n\nWhen joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have yet to arise, at this moment, one may reside in the regulated center, floating and swimming while subtly governing the four seasons to rectify creation. Within the four dignified postures, one must not lose proper measure! When things come, respond and then pass, returning to the center—never disturbing the central pillar. Within the center, always maintain emptiness, not a speck of dust standing. Over time, neither indulgent nor restrained, one naturally attains its benefits.\n\nIts essential subtlety lies in the six yin returning to *Kun*, all things reverting to the origin, the *Fu* hexagram’s first sprouting. The eldest son succeeds the father’s body; where the solitary yang stirs in concealment, before the myriad things are born—all arises from this point, the place of activation.\n\nAt this time, sit cross-legged in great stillness, concentrate the spirit within, and regulate the breath to be continuous. Silently guard it, and a single qi emerges from the formless void—dim and obscure, without color or shape, manifesting in the profound darkness of *Kun* and *Gui*, born within the kidneys to nurture the primal essence, replenish and sustain the primal qi, ceaselessly strengthening day by day. First, it dispels illness; next, it returns to infancy. Accumulated, it becomes the foundation of the inner elixir!\n\nMaster Tuzhen said: \"This is the primal qi replenishing the primal qi—how could it be mere common cinnabar?\" This is the supreme method of supplementation.\n\n**Morning Layering (Zhaotun)**\nThe *Zhaotun* embodies the beginning of the noble one’s governance, the first sprouting of the myriad things—the inception of benevolence. At the *zi* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the kidneys. It comes unbidden, and one should treasure and nurture it. Regulate the breath so the ears do not hear it; simply listen to its gentle, continuous flow, harmonizing with nature, resonating with the key of heaven and earth. Over time, kidney qi merges with heart qi, the two qi interacting to descend sweet dew and produce the mysterious pearl!\n\n**Evening Enveloping (Mumeng)**\n\"Enveloping to nurture correctness\" is the sagely work, not losing the heart of the infant. At the *wu* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the heart. Without thought or worry, in utter stillness, inwardly illuminate and unite with it. One should sit in quietude to gather it. Over time, heart qi naturally merges with kidney qi, accomplishing the work of *jiji* (completion and benefit).\n\nHumans reside within the three powers, their body equaling heaven and earth, thus corresponding to the qi of heaven and earth and aligning with the essence of the true one. A person’s primal qi spans eight hundred and ten *zhang*, resembling the bellows and key. Thus, the great movement of primal qi follows heaven, and the lesser movement follows the sun. Yet people cannot embody and emulate heaven and earth, leading to rupture, damage, and the scattering of spirit—deviating from them on their own. How could heaven and earth deviate from them?\n\nIf one can follow its principles and grasp its mechanism, one may accord with the work of creation and engage in elixir refinement—the inner cultivation of the Dao of long life and enduring vision. Beyond humans, all are endowed with turbid confusion within the primal qi, merely transformed things. How could they govern the primal qi?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n\"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen-si*;\nIn autumn and winter, employ the outer use, from *wu* to *xu-hai*.\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn;\nDusk and dawn follow cold and heat.\nThe line statements hold benevolence and righteousness,\nTimely expressing joy and anger.\nThus responding to the four seasons,\nThe five phases attain their principles.\"\n\nTherefore, *zi-chou-yin* correspond to spring, *mao-chen-si* to summer, *wu-wei-shen* to autumn, and *you-xu-hai* to winter.\n\n*Zi-chou-yin* align with spring, when wood governs—wood embodies benevolence, the time of the myriad things’ arising. Thus, the two characters *xihe* (radiant harmony) nurture it, flourishing like spring ascending a terrace. *He* (harmony) is beauty—central yellow penetrating principle, rightly positioned in the body, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in undertakings, the utmost beauty. Like an infant not yet laughing, crying without hoarseness—this is the utmost harmony. Unaware of the union of male and female, yet the genitalia stir—this is the utmost essence.\n\n*Mao-chen-si* align with summer, when fire governs—fire embodies ritual, the time of the myriad things’ flourishing. Thus, the two characters *zhonghe* (central harmony) nurture it. Once harmonized, without excess or deficiency, this is called the center, where emotions and nature roam freely without turbulence.\n\n*Wu-wei-shen* align with autumn, when metal governs—metal embodies righteousness, the time of yellowing grass and falling leaves, the harvest of the myriad things. Thus, the two characters *lianjing* (gathering and stillness) nurture it, fulfilling the nature of the myriad things.\n\nThe *you-xu-hai* align with winter, when water governs—water embodies wisdom, the time of the myriad things returning to their roots, when primordial *qi* begins its solemnity. Thus, the two characters *liansu* (gathering and solemnity) nurture it, aligning with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"The true person abides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass’s center.\" The true person is none other than the one true self: when congealed, it becomes spirit; when employed, it becomes mind; when still, it becomes nature. Neither moving nor still, empty yet spiritually penetrating—this is also called the true heart. It roams within the compass’s center, within the square and circle’s rules, serving as the master of creation. Its movements never err, centrally attuned to the four seasons, reliably nurtured to become true earth.\n\nIssuing commands and decrees, it nurtures primordial *qi*, regulates and preserves primordial essence, transforming and generating purity. It harmonizes the five phases without coercion, thereby connecting with the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Thus, rectifying the heart and sincerifying the intent enables selflessness.\n\nOnly then are *Qian* and *Kun* at peace while *Kan* and *Li* unite, yin and yang harmonize so the myriad things flourish, the three luminaries align in proper measure, and great peace is achieved. Thereafter, the state prospers and the people are at ease, and the hundred bones are all ordered.\n\n**Explanation of the \"Spring in the Qin Garden\" by the Pure Yang True Person**\n\nThe *Qin Garden Spring* lyric by the Pure Yang Wondrous Dao True Person encapsulates the supreme principles of returning the elixir, disseminated throughout the world. Though commentaries abound, they often remain pedantic and overelaborate—how could they grasp that this bit of immortal method lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates? Thus, one must meet heart with heart, intent with intent. Only when one reaches the delight of that realm does one trust that it arises naturally.\n\nOne might say the essential Dao is not complex, the practice is effortless—free from the web of doubts, one enters the gate of myriad wonders. Here I have composed sixteen quatrains in seven-character lines, pairing each with a verse by Master Tongning, totaling twenty pounds in weight, with direct annotations to reveal the profound mechanism. May the reader savor them carefully: grasp one corner, and all corners become evident.\n\n**Preface by Yuxi the Late Learner of Yichun, during the Purification Festival of the Bingyin year of the Xianchun era**\n\n**Lyrics for the Qin Garden Offering**\n\nLifting the topic at hand is itself the affair of the Dao-heart.\nHark!\nOn a fine night of clear brightness,\nIn the primordial chaos of the infant child,\nOne attains the delight within the stringless zither—\nThe notes and tones are not for outsiders to know.\n\nSevenfold return of the elixir, gold reverts to its original nature:\nThis is the sevenfold return, achieving success through earth,\nCalled the ninefold return.\nWhen emotion merges with the sea of nature, it is called union;\nThe furnace refines golden radiance, termed the return.\nNurtured wholly by the power of true earth,\nThe refined spiritual essence emerges from the dusty world.\n\nFor the practitioner, the great Dao resides solely within the self;\nThe inner elixir must be refined a hundred times.\nThe Great One divides into three, yet one is obtained;\nThe great medicine is sought only within the body.\nPitiful are the myriad thousands who take it all for pleasure and ease.\n\nFirst, refine the self and await the moment.\nRefining the self begins with subduing the heart;\nGathering the medicine has its own season.\nTurning the mechanism sets one apart from the vulgar;\nThe heart is serene and still, like an infant.\nObserve closely: the Creator originally has no thing—\nWhen spring arrives in Jiangnan, flowers bloom of themselves.\n\nAt the first stirring of the true yang,\nKun transforms into Fu—\nIs this not the heart of heaven and earth revealed?\nSitting in stillness upon the rush mat, thoughts cease;\nThe spirit’s abode breathes in and out, gradually slowing.\nWarm, misty qi returns to the celestial valley—\nKnow this as the time when the one yang returns.\n\nIn the depths of night, the water clock endures:\nThe depths of night are midnight,\nWhen within the clepsydra one first senses the lengthening hours.\nVapor rises in waves, all sounds are clear;\nWithin the body, the winter solstice arrives at the third watch.\nWho can fathom such delightful savor?\nOnly the sound of the bronze clepsydra’s dripping is heard.\n\nThe lead cauldron, warm and gentle—\nThe cauldron is not of metal, the furnace not of the moon.\nLi arises from below Kan, Dui resides within the cauldron.\nThe jade hare’s decoction boils and surges;\nThe golden furnace’s fire blazes, its light resplendent.\nWho in the profound darkness recognizes the existence within nothingness?\nWithin lies golden radiance, the foundation of the sage.\n\nLight pierces the curtains—\nThe original spirit generates yang;\nThe spirit’s light flickers, the heart illumines inwardly,\nAll returns to the primal void.\nAt first, the azure qi—color yet not color—\nEmerges from the dragon tower to return to the phoenix palace.\nBeneath the lapis lazuli screen, candles glow in mutual brilliance;\nBy the Jiang’s head, the rain has just ceased.\n\nCreation hastens swiftly:\nHusband and wife return to the chamber.\nWhen the moon reaches the yang palace,\nAmidst the peach-blossom waves,\nDragon and tiger meet.\nRed and black converge, unknown to the world;\nAll relies on Wu and Ji as the matchmaker.\nA full ladle of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nSeek it with intent and sip it in.\n\nThe work of advancing the fire is like navigating peril.\nFire arises within water, flowers bloom within thunder;\nOne must remain vigilant, applying skillful means with stability.\nWithin the realm of primordial chaos, qi is misty and warm;\nOn the branch of red apricot, it is the second month of spring.\nSimply secure the golden gate firmly shut—\nThe turning mechanism is ever the treasure within the house.\n\nBy the winding river, the moon’s radiance is serene and bright—\nA crow takes flight.\nThe oxherd and weaver girl share affection;\nThe Dao is fundamentally like the tortoise and snake,\nInnately so.\nWhen the yang crow meets the new moon, they unite in beauty;\nThe two qi mutually support and revolve.\nThis is the mutual affinity of lead and mercury—\nDo not mistake it for the nine bends of the small intestine.\n\nMaster Xiaozhen’s verse says:\nAbove the winding river, the magpie bridge spans;\nThe oxherd and weaver girl’s bond—\nThis is the Dao itself.\nThe great medicine, the golden elixir, is born from this.\nIf you do not believe, knock upon the gate of Jia and Yi—\nThe twin youths will naturally guide you on your way.\nThe gate of Jia and Yi is like the gate of Wu and Ji.\nThis principle is profoundly deep and far-reaching,\nDifficult to express with brush or tongue—\nYet it is merely the affair of the body itself.\n\nHark!\nTo know the path beneath the mountain,\nAsk those who come and go.\n\nAt that time, one drinks the knife and measure:\nThe two earths are Wu and Ji;\nThe golden blade is lead and mercury.\nDragon coiled, tiger crouched, they guard the center;\nLi and Kan unite, the light of sun and moon.\nAfter drinking, one awakens and returns to the grotto palace—\nIn the flowery pond, the lotus fragrance is rich.\n\nWho would believe a child is nurtured within nothingness?\nWithin the body, yin and yang;\nWithin the pot, sun and moon.\nAll immortals and sages—\nOriginally, there is no difference.\nIf one is not of this realm,\nHow can I explain it?\n\nRefine essence to nurture the spiritual root, refine qi to nurture the spirit;\nThe merging of lead and mercury gestates the true body.\nSuddenly, one emerges through the crown of the mud-pill palace—\nOnly then does one trust that the immortals do not deceive.\n\nDiscern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source,\nThe separation of wood and metal—\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is difficult to know.\nLead sinks, silver floats;\nThe clear is above, the turbid below.\nThe clear is golden radiance, the turbid is leaden essence.\nTo merge golden radiance with the liquid of wood—\nThis is the wondrous method of employing lead.\nWhen the two substances meet, emotion and nature blend;\nWhen the millet pearl forms, wood and metal separate.\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is difficult to know.\nClear and turbid, sinking and floating, share a single source;\nTo take the clear and discard the turbid is even more profound.\nThe blending and separation must be distinguished—\nThe wonder lies in a single word from a true teacher.\n\nThe Dao is subtle and mysterious, the heavenly mechanism deep and distant;\nTo begin practice swiftly is still too late.\nOnly when one reaches the point of shame in learning\nDoes one realize one’s skill is not refined.\n\nAs Master Baiyun said:\nThose who slander it are like grasping a giant melon stem to sweep Kunlun;\nThose who taste it are like swans drinking from the vast sea.\nThe views of the well-frog and fence-sparrow—\nHow could they know the vastness of sea and sky?\n\nDiligence without encounter—\nOne must eventually encounter it;\nTo encounter it and not refine it is utter folly.\nCherish each moment, do not let time pass in vain.\nOne must awaken swiftly and practice urgently—\nWhen will the precious pearl in hand become bright?\nIf the hut is ruined, how can it be rebuilt?\n\nWithin the millet pearl, the world is vast;\nThe immortals and perfected ones enter it with vigor.\nHow many gaze in vain, merely admiring—\nSighing in vain that the heavens are high and unattainable.\n\nMaster Changchun’s verse says:\nSun and moon swiftly fly above the crown;\nTime swiftly passes before the eyes.\nTurning to look back, one is already old—\nTo begin practice swiftly is still too late.\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, in the southern part of Yichun City, the household of Prefect Wei was often shrouded in mystery. One day, a strange man entered directly into the study and called out, \"Prefect Wei, come and speak with me.\" At that time, Wei was napping during the day, and his attendants dared not inform him. The stranger then inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall before leaving, titled *Sumuzhe*. When Wei awoke and saw it, he deeply regretted it, sending people to search for the man, but he could not be found. The poem read:\n\nGold surges through the waters, aligning with the Dipper;\nJade locks and golden gates—\nGuardian spirits stand watch.\nCrimson waters, cinnabar terraces,\nDragons and tigers roam,\nMyriad forms in solemn array,\nVigorously casting forth the pearl.\n\nDrink from the sacred spring, refine the fire’s timing,\nThe Great One’s furnace opens,\nThe elixir ripens, divine radiance shines through.\nFleeting fame and profit soon fade—\nBegin practice swiftly,\nSeek the existence within nothingness.\nThe path to Penglai—\nRely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,\nStriding alone upon the clouds to return.\n\nThe *Scripture of the August Void* states: \"Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first establish merit. Thus, the Celestial Emperors, the exalted Lords of Heaven, the Perfected Ones, and the Divine Immortals all ascend to the sacred and true ranks through meritorious effort. Heaven records merit, and those in the world who cultivate the true and sincere resolve—once merit is complete and virtue perfected—shed their mortal forms to become immortals, immortals transform into Perfected Ones, and Perfected Ones attain boundless freedom, merging with the natural. When dissolved, they become qi; when at rest, they become human. With divine powers unrestrained, they transform without form, soaring through the Three Realms, traversing the hidden and obscure. Those who practice refinement must first cherish essence and treasure qi, anchoring the mind and concentrating spirit to establish the foundation of nurturing. Then, entering seclusion for three thousand days, internal work must not be lacking, until the embryo is fully formed, transcending to the primordial origin. External conduct also aids this, aligning with the Dao of Heaven. Thus, merit is never too much, and deeds are never too vast. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one becomes an immortal in the Great Veil; with three thousand deeds accomplished, one becomes a guest in the Great Veil.\"\n\nMaster Zhongli said: \"Merit without conduct is like having no feet; conduct without merit leaves one unable to advance. Only with both merit and conduct complete are the feet fully prepared—who then can say one has no share in becoming a divine immortal?\"\n\nMoreover, in cultivating the Dao and attaining the Way, one first resides in Penglai, Fangzhang, or Yingzhou, becoming a free-roaming immortal. The Supreme One, the Primordial Lord, then summons one to receive the chart, inscribing one’s name in the immortal register, ascending step by step to the sacred rank, paying homage to the Jade Emperor, and bearing the title of Perfected One. One must further guide and enlighten those who come after, spreading teachings and transformations, until reaching the state of no cultivation and no attainment—this is called the natural.\n\nA poem by a High Perfected One reads:\nIn the tenth month, the fire’s timing is cast aside,\nInternal work is counted in three thousand days.\nFurther relying on external conduct to align with the Dao of Heaven,\nTranscending to the primordial origin, one attains the rank of Supreme Immortal.\n\nOn the day when Master Quanzhen, Wa Zhang, attained the Dao, he composed the *Ci of Untying the Pendant*, saying:\nCultivators of the Way,\nYour meritorious efforts are no small matter.\nDiscern the reversal and inversion of the Five Phases,\nThe wondrous principle is profoundly abstruse.\nWithin the jade furnace, dragons coil and tigers crouch,\nIn the golden tripod, the supreme treasure is refined.\nThe yang spirit departs the body,\nVast and obscure,\nIn an instant, it roams the Three Isles.\nOnce entry and exit are mastered,\nRestrain and hold fast,\nSeek further mysteries,\nMerge with true emptiness—\nThe Great Void is the ultimate end.\n\nFive Secret Poems:\n\n**I**\nHiss and exhale—three feet, yet no trace,\nReleased and gathered swiftly as the wind.\nAmong a hundred thousand, select one or two,\nThis Dao is entrusted to you alone.\n\n**II**\nExtended like lightning, round as the moon,\nNot for men—do not draw near.\nTo realize Buddhahood or become a Perfected One,\nThese subtle wonders require a master.\n\n**III**\nSevering nails and cutting iron, dispelling delusion,\nThe wondrous use, freely applied, comes from the master.\nReturning at will, filling the sleeves,\nCherish and nurture it like a grandson.\n\n**IV**\nRadiance blazes, pressing upon the body,\nBones tremble, hairs stand on end—what is to be done?\nIf you are truly a man, you will not fear,\nWith a single flourish, the truth is revealed at once.\n\n**V**\nAmong a hundred thousand, one or two,\nA single flourish must align with the hearts of sages and worthies.\nThe Red Youth manifests divine auspices,\nWithered wood blooms, iron turns to gold.\n\n**Eulogy for the Portrait of the Pure Yang Immortal**\nSupreme virtue defies description,\nPrimordial merit governs nothing—\nWhat need for verses or praises?\nHeaven is impartial,\nOnly virtue is aided;\nThe sagely teacher is never far.\n\nWith the bearing of a phoenix and the essence of a dragon,\nA true Confucian of his generation,\nHis beard like a coiled dragon, his moon-like visage—\nA descendant of Tang officials.\nAwakened by the dream of yellow millet,\nHe severed the endless cycle of life and death.\nOnce the elixir was complete, he sought only to deliver others,\nHis rank exalted, ever aiding the drowning.\nIn the south, he refined gold lead and wood mercury;\nIn Bianjing, he tasted jade nectar and *suka*.\nSpreading the One Vibration to perfect the true,\nCountless living beings relied on his grace.\nWielding the Three Swords as admonitions,\nDark and countless disciples received his love.\nAt times, he wandered amidst white reeds and red dreams;\nAt times, he dwelled in the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.\nLetting go of all, he beheld the Great Void,\nYet still stood in attendance in the Hall of Luminous Understanding.\nThroughout the land, his noble demeanor was longed for,\nHis divine traces shone across the realm.\n\nMaster Guo on Mount Ao longed to return—\nThe master spoke of himself thus.\nDaoist Peng still awaited enlightenment—\nThis was Peng Chongyang.\n\nFor eons, I have been foolish and deluded,\nEntangled in habitual tendencies.\nSince gaining discernment,\nI have never measured my strength,\nIndulging in every pursuit—\nOnly the Dao of immortals and Buddhas\nHave I not yet inquired into.\n\nMy elder, Lord Yue Suchan of Changsha, a descendant of officials, shared my passion,\nAnd we became friends despite the difference in age.\nI knew he was a dharma-friend of Peng Chongyang and Hu Guchan,\nAll three having received the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir from Master Yuxi.\nOne day, as we spoke of the frontier,\nHe suddenly stood and spoke earnestly:\n\"In my daily visits to friends and searches for teachers,\nI have spared neither body nor life.\nLater, I met Master Yuxi,\nAnd though you and I have only shared simple affections and casual discourse,\nThe time for learning the Dao has its own causes and conditions.\nSince you have reached this point,\nThe time is now!\nWait for an auspicious day to transmit the teachings.\"\nThus, in the *chen* hour of the *jiazi* day,\nHe secretly imparted a few words,\nEncouraging me to try them out.\n\nWithin less than a month, the elixir path proved efficacious—what was called \"golden light suffusing the body,\" \"jade towers and crimson palaces,\" \"dragon and tiger, infant and maiden,\" all appearing in a fleeting trance with vivid clarity. Upon hearing this, Master Yue stroked his tears and sighed: \"Since I first heard the Dao, my body has been plagued by fleshly ailments, preventing me from gathering my strength. Thus, I have yet to begin the work of stoking the fire. You, however, were born with immortal bones—this is no trifling matter. I dare not claim to be your teacher. Instead, I point to one among them who bears an uncanny resemblance to Master Yuxi. Simply don the robes and cap to capture the master’s likeness, and take him as your teacher. I now entrust you solemnly with all the master’s handwritten texts and these ten volumes.\"\n\nLater, I heard from the slightly acquainted Administrator Shu Zong: \"The master once stayed in my family’s home. When my father, the Pacification Commissioner, completed his term, we traveled together back to Huai, with the master lodging and dining in the kitchen boat, tethered by an iron chain to the stern of our vessel. As we neared Zhenzhou, a sudden storm arose, and the chain snapped—both boat and belongings vanished into the surging waves. Two days later, the master appeared at Yangzi Bridge, clutching a small bundle of clothes. As our boat was being woven together, he bid my father farewell in person before departing. Only then did we realize the master had attained the Dao of entering water without drowning. My family sighed in awe endlessly.\"\n\nSince receiving the transmission, fifty-five years have passed, and now, at ninety, I have labored to depict the immortal’s likeness at the end of the preface to these ten volumes, committing them to woodblocks to ensure their wide dissemination. On this day of the fourteenth year of the Zhizheng era, Wang Junzhang of Zhongyang, with incense lit, respectfully inscribes this.\n\n*Essential Pointers on the Elixir Classics of Master Yuxi, Volume the Lower* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "Lan asked, \"Is there not a white mole between your brows?\"\nThe Master replied, \"There is.\"\nLan said, \"This was Liu Haichan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo, and none but he could verify its fruition. Pray, repeat his words to me.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"The Recluse Liu inquires of the Master—how does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?\"\n\nLan clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Suddenly, a rumbling like thunder resounded from his crown, and a figure radiant as snow and moonlight—indistinguishable from Lan—ascended straight into the heavens. Lan had already departed.\n\nThe Master burned incense, sighed, and withdrew. This was the \"Long-Laughing Master of Yue Mountain.\" (See *Records of Marvelous Encounters in Our Family* and *Gazetteer of Yichun*.)\n\nUpon returning home, the Master gathered hagiographies of immortals, Daoist scriptures, and various philosophical texts, shut his door to visitors, and pored over them by day. Before long, he too passed away without illness. (His *Xian’guan Collection* circulates in the world.)\n\nI am his descendant. Though I studied the Confucian classics in youth, my aspirations were unfulfilled. Yet in the canons of Daoism and Buddhism, the classics of astrology, music, medicine, and divination, I explored all without exception. My heart, however, was especially devoted to the single secret of the Golden Elixir. Thus, I traversed rivers and lakes, journeyed across mountains and plains, and even bowed to beggars to seek their instruction. My resolve unwavering, heaven guided my heart.\n\nI encountered a perfected one within the Gui Xian precinct at the Temple of Prince Wang, and later met him again in Jiangling Prefecture. A single word from him illumined the principles of the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions. I once sojourned in Wudang, Xiangyang, the Han River, the Jiang and Huai regions—no place I did not visit. Yet few among them were enlightened, discerning masters of the subtle mechanism. Thus, I sealed my lips and spoke not a word of the Mystery.\n\nBy the *guihai* year of the Jingding era (1263, Southern Song, Emperor Lizong), I had traveled from Jingxiang to Xingcha, not far from Languan. There, I met someone from my hometown. In conversation, I inquired after old acquaintances, only to find the strong now aged and the aged passed away. Unbidden, tears flowed.\n\nI reflected: As the Perfected One of Ziyang said, \"To plan for oneself is gain, but to begrudge the Dao is the greatest transgression.\" Thereupon, I opened my heart in prayer to heaven, unlocking the Golden Gate and Jade Key. Compiling these, I wrote the *Essential Pointers to the Wuzhen Pian*, the *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*, and the *Treatise on Dispelling Delusion*. For those who asked about the teachings, fearing the symbols and images were not exhaustive, I further expounded the functions of the Primordial Sovereign to clarify the advance and retreat of talismanic fire—this may be said to reveal the celestial mechanism.\n\nThose who aspire to the Way must treasure what they have attained. Let each cultivate and each achieve perfection; when merit is complete and virtue perfected, all shall together verify the fruit of immortality. Should one grow careless, calamity will swiftly manifest. Though my words are coarse and unrefined, they contain nothing beyond the practical matters of the inner chamber.

      "translated_text": "**The *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:**\nThe four seas converge like spokes to a hub, establishing great peace—all through the virtue of earth in the central palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor.\n*The Covenant* says: \"The three things of one household all return to *wu* and *ji*.\"\nMaster Ziyang said: \"This is to send them back to the earthen cauldron, firmly sealed.\"\nAs the linchpin of metal, wood, water, and fire, the work of the Five Phases is complete!\n\n**I. The Knife-Tip (Dao Gui)**\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*If *li* and *kan* lack *wu* and *ji*,\nThough they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form.\nFor only when each embraces true earth\nCan the golden elixir return and restore.*\n\nMaster Yuzhen said: \"The great medicine never departs from true *wu* and *ji*—hence the immortals call it *one knife-tip*.\"\nThe *knife* is a metaphor for metal; the *tip* (gui), for the two earths. To *drink the knife-tip* is to flow *wu* into *ji*.\nMaster Shizhen said: \"When you know how lead and mercury unite, you may drink the knife-tip.\"\n*The Restoration of Life* says:\n*The dragon and tiger, once entwined, gaze longingly,\n*Kan* and *li*, now cleansed, conceive the embryo.\nA single handful of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nSeek it with intent, and seize it when it comes.*\nThis is to drink the knife-tip in that very moment.\n\n**II. The Matchmaker**\nThe *matchmaker* is a metaphor for union. When lead is cast to meet mercury, without a matchmaker, it cannot be done—this is the Yellow Dame.\n(It is not the spleen.)\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*If true lead is to retain mercury,\nThe sovereign must not depart from his ministers.\nWood and metal, though estranged, meet by no cause—\nOnly the matchmaker’s allure can bridge them.*\nThis, too, is the principle of flowing *wu* into *ji*.\n\n**III. Gathering and Harvesting**\n*Gathering* is to gather without gathering; *harvesting*, to harvest without harvesting.\nIt cannot be sought with intention, nor obtained without it.\nMaster Shao said:\n*At winter solstice, midnight’s half,\nThe heart of heaven never shifts.\nWhere the first yang stirs,\nBefore the ten thousand things arise—\nAll begins here, the place of action.*\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: \"The Dao of *qian* becomes male; the Dao of *kun* becomes female.\"\nThus, at sixteen, a man’s true essence is full, corresponding to *qian*; at fourteen, a woman’s celestial water descends, corresponding to *kun*.\n*Qian* embraces *jia* and *ren*; *kun* embraces *yi* and *gui*—creation has its origins here!\nMaster Ziyang said: \"When lead appears at *gui*, gather it swiftly.\"\nThis is the end of *kun* and the beginning of *fu*, before the primordial *qi* of *taiyi* manifests. Wait for the first yang to stir, then gather it urgently.\n\"Gold met at a distance is not worth tasting\"—lest the delicate blossom scatter carelessly.\nMaster Fuming the Chan Master said:\n*Gathering must be secret,\nThe heart sincere, discerning beauty from ugliness.\nThe thread of intent is hard to trace—\nA moment’s ease, and the cold spring is lost.*\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Tap the bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom,\nPluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife-tip.*\nThis is the pivotal mechanism of drawing lead into the crucible—it is not the art of \"refining metal with the jade woman.\"\n\n**IV. Fusion and Coagulation**\nAn ancient song says:\n*The sun is *li*, the moon is *kan*—\nTheir essences devour each other.*\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Both things are born of the child producing the mother,\nThe Five Phases must all enter the central palace.*\nThis is the union of the five stars in a string, the sun and moon as one disk.\nThe later Master Ma Danyang said:\n*Fire arises in water—banish the heart’s scenery,\nFlowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of intent.*\nSuch is the vision at the time of fusion and coagulation.\nLet those who study the Dao savor this deeply!\n\n**V. Steaming and Refining**\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*Below lies the *qi* of the great yang,\nSteaming and seething in an instant.*\nAnd:\n*Rising and roasting on the mountain of rice,\nThe blazing fire is set below.*\nAnd:\n*A clamor of voices, so mournful,\nLike an infant longing for its mother.*\nAnd:\n*When *yinghuo* guards the west and *taibai* crosses the sky,\nThe killing *qi* descends—what can stand unshaken?\nThe fox and dog guard the rat; the crow and sparrow fear the crane.*\n*The Restoration of Life* says:\n*Seize the essence and marrow of the crow and hare,\nHasten to gather and refine them in the crucible.*\n\nAn ancient song says:\n*The divine fire steams the lead’s *qi* away by night,\nThe old turtle swallows the soul of *Zhurong*.*\nThis is the natural principle of steaming and refining. Those who do not understand creation should not lightly discuss it.\n\n**VI. The Union of Metal and Wood**\nMetal is the nature of lead; wood, the nature of mercury. In the profound and indistinct, they defy description.\nMetal within the body is firm, strong, and pure, coursing through the four limbs—this is metal’s true nature, not the nature of desire.\nWood within the interior is soft, yielding, and compassionate, like sweating at the croak of a frog—this is wood’s true nature, the very root of benevolence.\nMetal’s nature, nurtured by lead, becomes supple; wood’s nature, congealed by mercury, becomes dense. When lead and mercury meet, their natures intertwine in mutual longing.\nMaster Zhenyi said: \"The male’s nature and the female’s essence, each needing the other, embrace and exhale, gathering and generating, transforming into true essence to become the divine medicine.\"\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s nature yearns for wood’s kindness.\nDevouring each other, yet growing closer,\nOnly then does the man conceive.*\n*The Covenant* says: \"When metal returns to its original nature, it is called the returning elixir.\"\nAnd: \"Metal fells, wood flourishes.\"\nWithout the matchmaker’s harmony, there would be the peril of estrangement!\n\n**VII. The Clarity and Turbidity of the Water’s Source**\nThe *water’s source* is a metaphor for the heart’s source, the sea of nature. When the dragon coils and the tiger crouches, clouds disperse and mists clear—then the waves of the sea of desire are stilled, the billows of the river of love are calmed. In stillness, heaven and earth are vast; in leisure, the sun and moon are long.\nWhether turbid or clear, you will see it in that moment.\n\n**VIII. Warm Nurturing**",
      "overlap_context": "e names are many.\nCalled true mercury,\nIt is merely the liquid of wood.\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*Of itself, the heaven’s spirit restrains the water-metal.*\nIt meets true lead to form the elixir,\nAnd is restrained by true earth to unite.\n\n---\n\n**V. True Earth**\nTrue earth is *wu* and *ji*,\nThe central palace,\nThe *kun* palace—\nIt is not the spleen.\nWhen lead meets mercury,\nWithout true earth, they cannot fuse and congeal.\nWielding the sword and laying down the halberd,\nIt governs the four directions.",

      "translated_text": "Eliminate passions and dispel desires, withdraw sight and return hearing, cast off the limbs, dull the senses, and remain foolish all day—never depart from this for even a moment. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, let no interruption occur; like a hen brooding her eggs, let the warmth never cease. Laozi said: *\"Concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\"* And again: *\"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.\"* The secret says: *\"Forget the form to nourish the qi, forget the qi to nourish the spirit, forget the spirit to nourish the void.\"* The true person guards the center of the compass, and the qi is like spring within the blossoms. When the seasonal cycle is complete, the embryo sheds its shell, and the spirit transforms.\n\n**Fire and Timing**\nFire is the fire of spirit; timing is the alignment of signs. Model the cauldron and furnace upon heaven and earth, use yang as charcoal, yin as water, and let the sun and moon revolve—one cold, one hot. The central sovereign issues commands, carefully harmonizing and blending. For the numinous medicine is formless yet subtly follows the mechanism of transformation, ascending and descending in reversal. Master Cao said: *\"When the qi of Li is reached in a hundred moments, cinnabar emerges from it.\"* There are rhythms of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, bathing—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, regret and misfortune arise at once. Master Ziyang said: *\"Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire and timing, it is as idle as leisure. All depends on the power of maintenance—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir will not form.\"* This matter belongs to the celestial mechanism and brooks no careless discussion; its general meaning is already evident in the Fuxi’s workings. The wise and discerning, by daily reflection, will naturally awaken.\n\nOf old, the Most High Lord Lao transmitted the *\"Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire and Timing of the Golden Elixir,\"* which are respectfully recorded here:\n\nThe sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nTheir hexagrammic cycles are most clearly marked.\n(From Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning, like a linked ring)\nThree and five before, three and five after—\n(The waxing and waning crescents)\nFive and six make thirty, returning to life—\n(The lunar nodes of a month)\nLife and death cycle through twelve—\n(The solar terms of a year)\nTwelve divided into twenty-four.\n(The twenty-four solar terms completing a year’s fire and timing)\nThe twenty-four terms mutually shift and change,\n(Revolving without end)\nAll phenomena, every ounce and grain, lie herein.\nMercury, one substance, divides into two,\nTransforming into yin and yang, becoming *jwei* and *wei*.\n*Jwei* and *wei* then unite as husband and wife,\nAnd one perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.\n\nThis song-verse was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Most High, revealing the subtlest principles of medicinal substances and fire-timing. It is decreed that later learners of the Dao should treat it with reverence. If any should slight or disdain it, calamity will swiftly follow—everywhere, at all times, there are divine spirits! One cannot be too cautious.\n\nMaster Pure Yang’s postscript says: *\"Great indeed are the twelve verses, harmonizing with the Five Thousand Words.\"*\n\n**Bathing**\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: *\"In the second month, the elm dies; in the eighth month, the wheat sprouts. When punishment and virtue stand at the gate, beware of peril.\"* Master Ziyang said: *\"In the months of the hare and the rooster, when the time arrives and the signs of punishment and virtue approach, this is when the golden cinnabar should be bathed. If fire is added instead, danger will surely overturn it.\"* Thus, at the hours of Mao and You, one should bathe to balance it, refraining from advancing the fire.\n\n**Shedding the Embryo**\nGradually grow larger, gradually grow more numinous, gradually come to completion. Master Ziyang said: *\"A fruit ripens on the branch in due time—how is the child in the womb any different?\"* Master Yunfang said: *\"The child is young and not yet fully formed; it must rely on the nurturing kindness of father and mother. After nine years and three years, when human affairs are exhausted, it will roam heaven and earth without dependence on kin.\"* Looking back at the old body, it is but a heap of dung and earth. When merit is complete and the fruit is full, one ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign. This may be called *\"form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\"* The *\"Song of Breaking Delusion\"* by the Most Supreme Perfected says:",

save him, swiftly teach him the Way’s principle.\n\nByways and minor arts branch in a thousand, ten thousand strands,\nbut the true Dao’s work is not so vast—it lies within oneself alone.\nTo spare the lost from delusion, I briefly name one or two:\n\nCirculating qi is not the Dao—\nbreath and pulse grow disordered.\nSwallowing saliva is not the Dao—\nspittle is not the water of spirit.\n\nVisualization is not the Dao—\npainting cakes cannot serve as food.\nAbsorbing yin is not the Dao—\nessence exhausted, life follows in death.\nAvoiding salt is not the Dao—\nfood loses all savor.\nFasting is not the Dao—\nhunger and weakness harm the stomach and bowels.\nAbandoning one’s wife is not the Dao—\nyin and yang lose their proper place.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao?\nThe Great One holds true qi,\nqi intermingling yet not intermingling,\nascending and descending in emulation of heaven and earth.\nTwo things pair and unite,\narising from the Primal Beginning—\nthe marvelous maiden and the infant boy,\nmatched to achieve the Completed Success.\nThese are true yin and true yang,\nhusband and wife sharing one meaning.\nThus there is no need to abandon—\nhow can solitary yang accomplish anything?\n\nTo proclaim oneself an immortal—\nis the golden elixir so easily attained?\nThe steadfast scholar does not speak plainly,\nfor the Great Cavern holds profound meaning.\n\nThe five phases do not proceed in order—\nthe tiger is born within water.\nThe five phases’ inverted art—\nthe dragon emerges from fire.\nThese words are truly wondrous—\nsuch is the power of the Great One.\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*\"Abandoning one’s wife needlessly severs yin and yang;\nfasting merely leaves the stomach and bowels empty.\"*\nThese lines quote the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Most Supreme Perfected.\nFasting is not the ultimate Dao,\nbut the teaching on abandoning one’s wife holds profound truth.\n\nNowadays, those bound for hell,\nupon seeing Ziyang’s words,\nimmediately misconstrue them as the \"Three Peaks of Golden Flower\" arts of bedchamber yoga,\nadding reckless annotations to mislead later generations,\ndragging scholars and gentlemen into hell.\nLittle do they know that the intent of the Most Supreme Perfected and Master Ziyang\nconcerns the union of true yin and true yang within the body.\nThus the *Cantong qi* says:\n*\"The male does not dwell alone,\nthe female does not live in solitude.\"*\nAnd further:\n*\"Things without yin and yang defy heaven and betray the origin;\na rooster hatching eggs alone will not produce whole chicks.\"*\nMaster Yunfang said:\n*\"Do not claim this body is wholly the Dao—\ncultivating a single element is but solitary yin.\"*\nBai Yuchan said:\n*\"Within one’s own body lies husband and wife—\nto speak of this to others is to invite mockery.\"*\nThis is the meaning.\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*\"If you can seek the inverted in daily use,\nthe sands of the earth all become treasure.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you can turn this mechanism of life and death,\ndisaster transforms to fortune in the palm of your hand.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"I urge you: in battle, do not underestimate the foe,\nlest you lose our priceless treasure.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,\nyou will know how harm gives rise to kindness.\"*\nLater, he admonished:\n*\"If you have not refined the elixir, refine it swiftly;\nonce refined, know when to stop.\nIf you persist in grasping without restraint,\nyou will one day meet with ruin and disgrace.\"*\nThis discourse guards against danger and considers peril—\nit concerns the mechanism of reversal.\nIf the mind of lust is not extinguished and the fire of desire burns below,\nthe great treasure will be lost, the foundation of life will crumble.\nWhen that time comes, how can regret avail?\n\nI reiterate this to warn those who study the Dao,\nhoping all will follow the true path and together ascend the immortal ranks,\nguiding those who come after,\nlest one blind man lead another blind.\n\nThe *Song of Flowing Pearls* by Immortal Ge Xixi says:\n*Flowing pearls, flowing pearls,\ncast to me in my smallness.\nWandering the four seas,\nperusing ten thousand books.\nEndlessly striving, forgetting sleep and meals,\nconsulting all friends, burning cinnabar to exhaustion.\nFor thirty years, sighing daily,\nnow at sixty, I fear descending the three woeful paths.\nThanks to my teacher’s transmission—\nthe primal qi of emptiness and nothingness.\nFirst stabilize the golden crucible,\nthen establish the jade furnace.\nThe fire of Li excites,\nthe water of Kan takes form.\nJade liquid irrigates,\nthe chamber of mystery flows with butter.\nThe Perfected One delivers me—\nonly a great man can do so.\nHold this in mind, remember this—\nentrust it to my record.*\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the ancients’ diligent study of the Dao\ninevitably met with the guidance of a perfected being.\n\nThe path of internal elixir refinement\nemploys no more than the two substances, lead and mercury.\nFirst cultivate the human Dao,\nwith loyalty and filial piety as the foundation,\naiding others as the priority.\nTreasure this one body,\ncultivating inner work and outer conduct,\neliminating desires, calming the mind and qi,\nmoderating diet, reducing sleep.\nThe supreme medicines within the body are essence, qi, and spirit—\nif essence is not recklessly discharged, primordial qi blends harmoniously;\nif primordial qi blends harmoniously, primordial spirit rests at ease.\nWhen these three are

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is the Dragon contending with the Tiger in battle—water surging, fire erupting, the cauldron seething and boiling over, their forces overturned and restrained, at times emitting the cries of an infant. The Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their numinous might; the True Man of Stone says: *\"The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair, Elder Ding’s heart is kind and merciful. Dragon and Tiger wage their war—how could the bound lord ever know?\"* The Yellow Dame was explained earlier; Elder Ding is the gentle fire.\n\nMaster Yin the True says: *\"I hold the Dao of the world, endless and boundless—yet I know only how to subdue the infant’s heart.\"* This is the true revelation of heaven’s secret. The shaking of heaven and earth startles gods and ghosts. An ancient song says: *\"The sage seizes the workings of creation, grasps sun and moon to place within the furnace. Gently stirring the essence of heaven and earth, he gathers yin and yang to rouse gods and ghosts.\"* Gods and ghosts are the celestial soul and earthly spirit.\n\nIn an instant, the battle ceases and the clouds disperse—clouds gather and rain scatters, all sounds return to silence, and within the palm, fortune is transformed. A mysterious pearl is planted in the mud’s depths. The *Fuming Pian* says: *\"At night, chaos falls to the earth—all the ten thousand images and signs know nothing of it.\"* This is the single drop descending into the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court is the central palace, the Yellow Chamber, the Mysterious Pass—likened to the mud’s depths.\n\nMaster Ziyang says: *\"Within one double-hour, the elixir is complete—this is the elixir’s daily accomplishment.\"* Day by day, it grows by a grain of millet, gradually forming the mysterious pearl. The Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl in the Red Waters—without the formless one, none could obtain it. This is that pearl; the formless one is without thought or care. From this, the root and sprout gradually mature. Constantly irrigated, it embraces true essence. Master Sanguzi says: *\"Establish the foundation for a hundred days, nurture it through the full cycle of stars. Simply guard the essence, tone, and spirit—water will naturally moisten, fire will naturally nurture, awaiting the qi’s fullness.\"*\n\nAfter ten months, the embryo is shed, and it is swallowed into the belly—suddenly, one senses the mortal body already imbued with spirit. Master Ziyang also says: *\"A single grain of numinous elixir is swallowed into the belly.\"* He speaks of *shedding the embryo* and *communing with the divine and sagely*. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and rain.\"* If this is the inner elixir, why does it speak of entering the belly, the mouth, the five viscera? Later generations doubted this and took it for an external elixir. Little did they know that *form arises from the formless*—this is what is called the Returned Elixir.\n\nTrue Master Unity speaks of first exploring the primal chaotic qi of heaven and earth to establish the root; then taking the essence of Qian and Kun, subtly moving its traces to form the model; following the numbers of Kan, Li, Pi, and Tai to determine punishment and virtue; stealing the mechanism of yin-yang’s transformations to complete winter and summer. Yin is born after noon, yang arises at midnight’s start—thus Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, the remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire times. Refining, nurturing, and subtly seizing the work of transformation—like fruit growing on a branch, the child within the womb, after ten months of fire times and qi’s fullness, suddenly sheds its spirit to enter the true embryo, uniting with heaven.\n\nThus it speaks of entering the mouth, the belly, the five viscera. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"It resembles a chicken’s egg, white and black aligned, a single inch in length and breadth, as the beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete. After ten months, it emerges from the womb.\"* This is *form arising from the formless*, a body beyond the body. Clinging to the old frame traps one in darkness; emerging from the ninth mud allows roaming heaven and earth. One’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, one’s title is True Man—this is the time when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.\n\nThis matter is rare in the world, not something ordinary people can know. If one lacks the immortal bones of past lives, how could one easily encounter it? Having encountered it, one should swiftly refine it—time flies like an arrow. To catch the fish, one must cast the net; do not stand by the abyss and sigh in vain. I hear you have known the medicine for many years—why not gather your heart and refine mercury and lead? Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind, for the six paths of rebirth leave no room for complaint.\n\nThese words admonish Immortal Liu, urging him to gather his heart and refine mercury and lead. From this, it is clear that the inner elixir must be refined within oneself—it is not a matter of external medicine. Recently, worldly people have grown cunning, competing to don Daoist robes and claim the Way. Ask them what metal and wood are—they fall silent, mute and ashamed.\n\nMetal and wood are explained in the *Essential Pointers*: *\"Without knowing this, one cannot speak of the Returned Elixir.\"* Yet they speak of breath cultivation and fasting, claiming other schools and doctrines are profound. Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*? *\"The Great One embraces true qi—this method is strongest.\"* The myriad minor side paths, though countless, have nothing to do with the Way of Golden Liquor and the Returned Inner Elixir. What is called the Dao? The Great One embracing true qi, the five stars aligning in a string, the sun and moon conjoining—this is how the inner elixir is formed, how the Dharma-body emerges. There is no second gate.\n\nDo not fault my words for their crudeness—it is only because the world lacks discernment. Only when your heart aligns with mine will I dare pour out my thoughts for you.\n\n---\n\n**Regulating the Center Diagram**\n*Preface to the Twelve-Character Formula of the Regulating the Center Diagram*\n\nThree thousand six hundred methods, dozens of schools for nurturing life—all are side paths, nothing but crooked trails. Take, for example, breath cultivation to inflate the empty belly, the *Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence*, absorbing and grinding to move the river chariot, holding the breath as fire times, inhaling the clear and exhaling the turbid, connecting to realms and lamenting flows, guiding the turtle and turning the perch, mirroring forms to seek liberation, storing the chimney, guarding the brow’s center—all are adding heads atop heads, stirring trouble where there is none, overturning order and deviating from the utmost truth.\n\nThus, the hundred vessels boil over, the three fields collapse into chaos. What was meant to grant eternal life instead harms it. This is truly going against the harmony of heaven and earth, failing to align with nature’s intent. After simplifying and studying the *Cantong Qi* for thirty years, I have grasped its mysteries. Drawing from the threads of the alchemical classics, I composed the *Twelve-Character Formula of the Regulating the Center Diagram* to transmit to those who study the Dao. It takes rectifying the heart and sincerely cultivating intention as its foundation, the central pillar—abiding in the center to govern the external.",

      "translated_text": "With the eight characters as auxiliaries, one regulates and governs the four seasons, responding to the internal from the external. Above, it aligns with the heart of heaven; in the middle, it examines human affairs; silently, it accords with creation, following the course of yin and yang. Externally, it models the five phases; internally, it orders the five viscera—thus forming the endless cycle of daily use.\n\nIt does not rely on action, nor does it depend on visualization. Serenely, in great stillness, it unites the primal mechanism. One must only sever cravings, stabilize the heart and qi, reduce thoughts, moderate diet, regulate breath, guard against drowsiness, and restrain the senses—nurturing the harmony of heaven. Within the four dignified postures, one merges with nature, without any complexity or difficulty.\n\nFor those who have already established the *yinqie* (the alchemical crucible), this serves to harmonize with the firing process and nurture the sacred embryo. For those who have not yet established the *yinqie*, this strengthens the primal qi, nourishes the spirit, and serves as the gradual foundation for its establishment. As for depletion, loss, illness, and affliction, this method dispels sickness, fortifies the primal, and serves as the art of supplementation, longevity, and life-nurturing—truly the gateway of simplicity!\n\n**The Regulating the Center Diagram**\nTo \"regulate the center\" is to dwell within a compass, neither in the middle nor within or without—neither clinging to images nor attaching to things. It resides in the center of the body, the center of intention, like the self within a great mirror. Simply rectify the heart and sincerely cultivate intention as the central pillar. When all distractions vanish, the true person appears—like a fish in the deep abyss, swimming freely yet never leaving the square inch. This is the true person abiding in the profound depths, floating and guarding the regulated center.\n\nWhen joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have yet to arise, at this moment, one may reside in the regulated center, floating and swimming while subtly governing the four seasons to rectify creation. Within the four dignified postures, one must not lose proper measure! When things come, respond and then pass, returning to the center—never disturbing the central pillar. Within the center, always maintain emptiness, not a speck of dust standing. Over time, neither indulgent nor restrained, one naturally attains its benefits.\n\nIts essential subtlety lies in the six yin returning to *Kun*, all things reverting to the origin, the *Fu* hexagram’s first sprouting. The eldest son succeeds the father’s body; where the solitary yang stirs in concealment, before the myriad things are born—all arises from this point, the place of activation.\n\nAt this time, sit cross-legged in great stillness, concentrate the spirit within, and regulate the breath to be continuous. Silently guard it, and a single qi emerges from the formless void—dim and obscure, without color or shape, manifesting in the profound darkness of *Kun* and *Gui*, born within the kidneys to nurture the primal essence, replenish and sustain the primal qi, ceaselessly strengthening day by day. First, it dispels illness; next, it returns to infancy. Accumulated, it becomes the foundation of the inner elixir!\n\nMaster Tuzhen said: \"This is the primal qi replenishing the primal qi—how could it be mere common cinnabar?\" This is the supreme method of supplementation.\n\n**Morning Layering (Zhaotun)**\nThe *Zhaotun* embodies the beginning of the noble one’s governance, the first sprouting of the myriad things—the inception of benevolence. At the *zi* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the kidneys. It comes unbidden, and one should treasure and nurture it. Regulate the breath so the ears do not hear it; simply listen to its gentle, continuous flow, harmonizing with nature, resonating with the key of heaven and earth. Over time, kidney qi merges with heart qi, the two qi interacting to descend sweet dew and produce the mysterious pearl!\n\n**Evening Enveloping (Mumeng)**\n\"Enveloping to nurture correctness\" is the sagely work, not losing the heart of the infant. At the *wu* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the heart. Without thought or worry, in utter stillness, inwardly illuminate and unite with it. One should sit in quietude to gather it. Over time, heart qi naturally merges with kidney qi, accomplishing the work of *jiji* (completion and benefit).\n\nHumans reside within the three powers, their body equaling heaven and earth, thus corresponding to the qi of heaven and earth and aligning with the essence of the true one. A person’s primal qi spans eight hundred and ten *zhang*, resembling the bellows and key. Thus, the great movement of primal qi follows heaven, and the lesser movement follows the sun. Yet people cannot embody and emulate heaven and earth, leading to rupture, damage, and the scattering of spirit—deviating from them on their own. How could heaven and earth deviate from them?\n\nIf one can follow its principles and grasp its mechanism, one may accord with the work of creation and engage in elixir refinement—the inner cultivation of the Dao of long life and enduring vision. Beyond humans, all are endowed with turbid confusion within the primal qi, merely transformed things. How could they govern the primal qi?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n\"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen-si*;\nIn autumn and winter, employ the outer use, from *wu* to *xu-hai*.\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn;\nDusk and dawn follow cold and heat.\nThe line statements hold benevolence and righteousness,\nTimely expressing joy and anger.\nThus responding to the four seasons,\nThe five phases attain their principles.\"\n\nTherefore, *zi-chou-yin* correspond to spring, *mao-chen-si* to summer, *wu-wei-shen* to autumn, and *you-xu-hai* to winter.\n\n*Zi-chou-yin* align with spring, when wood governs—wood embodies benevolence, the time of the myriad things’ arising. Thus, the two characters *xihe* (radiant harmony) nurture it, flourishing like spring ascending a terrace. *He* (harmony) is beauty—central yellow penetrating principle, rightly positioned in the body, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in undertakings, the utmost beauty. Like an infant not yet laughing, crying without hoarseness—this is the utmost harmony. Unaware of the union of male and female, yet the genitalia stir—this is the utmost essence.\n\n*Mao-chen-si* align with summer, when fire governs—fire embodies ritual, the time of the myriad things’ flourishing. Thus, the two characters *zhonghe* (central harmony) nurture it. Once harmonized, without excess or deficiency, this is called the center, where emotions and nature roam freely without turbulence.\n\n*Wu-wei-shen* align with autumn, when metal governs—metal embodies righteousness, the time of yellowing grass and falling leaves, the harvest of the myriad things. Thus, the two characters *lianjing* (gathering and stillness) nurture it, fulfilling the nature of the myriad things.",

      "translated_text": "One might say the essential Dao is not complex, the practice is effortless—free from the web of doubts, one enters the gate of myriad wonders. Here I have composed sixteen quatrains in seven-character lines, pairing each with a verse by Master Tongning, totaling twenty pounds in weight, with direct annotations to reveal the profound mechanism. May the reader savor them carefully: grasp one corner, and all corners become evident.\n\n**Preface by Yuxi the Late Learner of Yichun, during the Purification Festival of the Bingyin year of the Xianchun era**\n\n**Lyrics for the Qin Garden Offering**\n\nLifting the topic at hand is itself the affair of the Dao-heart.\nHark!\nOn a fine night of clear brightness,\nIn the primordial chaos of the infant child,\nOne attains the delight within the stringless zither—\nThe notes and tones are not for outsiders to know.\n\nSevenfold return of the elixir, gold reverts to its original nature:\nThis is the sevenfold return, achieving success through earth,\nCalled the ninefold return.\nWhen emotion merges with the sea of nature, it is called union;\nThe furnace refines golden radiance, termed the return.\nNurtured wholly by the power of true earth,\nThe refined spiritual essence emerges from the dusty world.\n\nFor the practitioner, the great Dao resides solely within the self;\nThe inner elixir must be refined a hundred times.\nThe Great One divides into three, yet one is obtained;\nThe great medicine is sought only within the body.\nPitiful are the myriad thousands who take it all for pleasure and ease.\n\nFirst, refine the self and await the moment.\nRefining the self begins with subduing the heart;\nGathering the medicine has its own season.\nTurning the mechanism sets one apart from the vulgar;\nThe heart is serene and still, like an infant.\nObserve closely: the Creator originally has no thing—\nWhen spring arrives in Jiangnan, flowers bloom of themselves.\n\nAt the first stirring of the true yang,\nKun transforms into Fu—\nIs this not the heart of heaven and earth revealed?\nSitting in stillness upon the rush mat, thoughts cease;\nThe spirit’s abode breathes in and out, gradually slowing.\nWarm, misty qi returns to the celestial valley—\nKnow this as the time when the one yang returns.\n\nIn the depths of night, the water clock endures:\nThe depths of night are midnight,\nWhen within the clepsydra one first senses the lengthening hours.\nVapor rises in waves, all sounds are clear;\nWithin the body, the winter solstice arrives at the third watch.\nWho can fathom such delightful savor?\nOnly the sound of the bronze clepsydra’s dripping is heard.\n\nThe lead cauldron, warm and gentle—\nThe cauldron is not of metal, the furnace not of the moon.\nLi arises from below Kan, Dui resides within the cauldron.\nThe jade hare’s decoction boils and surges;\nThe golden furnace’s fire blazes, its light resplendent.\nWho in the profound darkness recognizes the existence within nothingness?\nWithin lies golden radiance, the foundation of the sage.\n\nLight pierces the curtains—\nThe original spirit generates yang;\nThe spirit’s light flickers, the heart illumines inwardly,\nAll returns to the primal void.\nAt first, the azure qi—color yet not color—\nEmerges from the dragon tower to return to the phoenix palace.\nBeneath the lapis lazuli screen, candles glow in mutual brilliance;\nBy the Jiang’s head, the rain has just ceased.\n\nCreation hastens swiftly:\nHusband and wife return to the chamber.\nWhen the moon reaches the yang palace,\nAmidst the peach-blossom waves,\nDragon and tiger meet.\nRed and black converge, unknown to the world;\nAll relies on Wu and Ji as the matchmaker.\nA full ladle of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nSeek it with intent and sip it in.\n\nThe work of advancing the fire is like navigating peril.\nFire arises within water, flowers bloom within thunder;\nOne must remain vigilant, applying skillful means with stability.\nWithin the realm of primordial chaos, qi is misty and warm;\nOn the branch of red apricot, it is the second month of spring.\nSimply secure the golden gate firmly shut—\nThe turning mechanism is ever the treasure within the house.\n\nBy the winding river, the moon’s radiance is serene and bright—\nA crow takes flight.\nThe oxherd and weaver girl share affection;\nThe Dao is fundamentally like the tortoise and snake,\nInnately so.\nWhen the yang crow meets the new moon, they unite in beauty;\nThe two qi mutually support and revolve.\nThis is the mutual affinity of lead and mercury—\nDo not mistake it for the nine bends of the small intestine.\n\nMaster Xiaozhen’s verse says:\nAbove the winding river, the magpie bridge spans;\nThe oxherd and weaver girl’s bond—\nThis is the Dao itself.\nThe great medicine, the golden elixir, is born from this.\nIf you do not believe, knock upon the gate of Jia and Yi—\nThe twin youths will naturally guide you on your way.\nThe gate of Jia and Yi is like the gate of Wu and Ji.\nThis principle is profoundly deep and far-reaching,\nDifficult to express with brush or tongue—\nYet it is merely the affair of the body itself.\n\nHark!\nTo know the path beneath the mountain,\nAsk those who come and go.\n\nAt that time, one drinks the knife and measure:\nThe two earths are Wu and Ji;\nThe golden blade is lead and mercury.\nDragon coiled, tiger crouched, they guard the center;\nLi and Kan unite, the light of sun and moon.\nAfter drinking, one awakens and returns to the grotto palace—\nIn the flowery pond, the lotus fragrance is rich.\n\nWho would believe a child is nurtured within nothingness?\nWithin the body, yin and yang;\nWithin the pot, sun and moon.\nAll immortals and sages—\nOriginally, there is no difference.\nIf one is not of this realm,\nHow can I explain it?\n\nRefine essence to nurture the spiritual root, refine qi to nurture the spirit;\nThe merging of lead and mercury gestates the true body.\nSuddenly, one emerges through the crown of the mud-pill palace—\nOnly then does one trust that the immortals do not deceive.\n\nDiscern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source,\nThe separation of wood and metal—\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is difficult to know.\nLead sinks, silver floats;\nThe clear is above, the turbid below.\nThe clear is golden radiance, the turbid is leaden essence.\nTo merge golden radiance with the liquid of wood—\nThis is the wondrous method of employing lead.\nWhen the two substances meet, emotion and nature blend;\nWhen the millet pearl forms, wood and metal separate.\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is difficult to know.\nClear and turbid, sinking and floating, share a single source;\nTo take the clear and discard the turbid is even more profound.\nThe blending and separation must be distinguished—\nThe wonder lies in a single word from a true teacher.\n\nThe Dao is subtle and mysterious, the heavenly mechanism deep and distant;\nTo begin practice swiftly is still too late.\nOnly when one reaches the point of shame in learning\nDoes one realize one’s skill is not refined.\n\nAs Master Baiyun said:\nThose who slander it are like grasping a giant melon stem to sweep Kunlun;\nThose who taste it are like swans drinking from the vast sea.\nThe views of the well-frog and fence-sparrow—\nHow could they know the vastness of sea and sky?\n\nDiligence without encounter—\nOne must eventually encounter it;\nTo encounter it and not refine it is utter folly.\nCherish each moment, do not let time pass in vain.\nOne must awaken swiftly and practice urgently—\nWhen will the precious pearl in hand become bright?\nIf the hut is ruined, how can it be rebuilt?\n\nWithin the millet pearl, the world is vast;\nThe immortals and perfected ones enter it with vigor.\nHow many gaze in vain, merely admiring—\nSighing in vain that the heavens are high and unattainable.\n\nMaster Changchun’s verse says:\nSun and moon swiftly fly above the crown;\nTime swiftly passes before the eyes.\nTurning to look back, one is already old—\nTo begin practice swiftly is still too late.",

      "translated_text": "During the Shaoxing era, in the southern part of Yichun City, the household of Prefect Wei was often shrouded in mystery. One day, a strange man entered directly into the study and called out, \"Prefect Wei, come and speak with me.\" At that time, Wei was napping during the day, and his attendants dared not inform him. The stranger then inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall before leaving, titled *Sumuzhe*. When Wei awoke and saw it, he deeply regretted it, sending people to search for the man, but he could not be found. The poem read:\n\nGold surges through the waters, aligning with the Dipper;\nJade locks and golden gates—\nGuardian spirits stand watch.\nCrimson waters, cinnabar terraces,\nDragons and tigers roam,\nMyriad forms in solemn array,\nVigorously casting forth the pearl.\n\nDrink from the sacred spring, refine the fire’s timing,\nThe Great One’s furnace opens,\nThe elixir ripens, divine radiance shines through.\nFleeting fame and profit soon fade—\nBegin practice swiftly,\nSeek the existence within nothingness.\nThe path to Penglai—\nRely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,\nStriding alone upon the clouds to return.\n\nThe *Scripture of the August Void* states: \"Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first establish merit. Thus, the Celestial Emperors, the exalted Lords of Heaven, the Perfected Ones, and the Divine Immortals all ascend to the sacred and true ranks through meritorious effort. Heaven records merit, and those in the world who cultivate the true and sincere resolve—once merit is complete and virtue perfected—shed their mortal forms to become immortals, immortals transform into Perfected Ones, and Perfected Ones attain boundless freedom, merging with the natural. When dissolved, they become qi; when at rest, they become human. With divine powers unrestrained, they transform without form, soaring through the Three Realms, traversing the hidden and obscure. Those who practice refinement must first cherish essence and treasure qi, anchoring the mind and concentrating spirit to establish the foundation of nurturing. Then, entering seclusion for three thousand days, internal work must not be lacking, until the embryo is fully formed, transcending to the primordial origin. External conduct also aids this, aligning with the Dao of Heaven. Thus, merit is never too much, and deeds are never too vast. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one becomes an immortal in the Great Veil; with three thousand deeds accomplished, one becomes a guest in the Great Veil.\"\n\nMaster Zhongli said: \"Merit without conduct is like having no feet; conduct without merit leaves one unable to advance. Only with both merit and conduct complete are the feet fully prepared—who then can say one has no share in becoming a divine immortal?\"\n\nMoreover, in cultivating the Dao and attaining the Way, one first resides in Penglai, Fangzhang, or Yingzhou, becoming a free-roaming immortal. The Supreme One, the Primordial Lord, then summons one to receive the chart, inscribing one’s name in the immortal register, ascending step by step to the sacred rank, paying homage to the Jade Emperor, and bearing the title of Perfected One. One must further guide and enlighten those who come after, spreading teachings and transformations, until reaching the state of no cultivation and no attainment—this is called the natural.\n\nA poem by a High Perfected One reads:\nIn the tenth month, the fire’s timing is cast aside,\nInternal work is counted in three thousand days.\nFurther relying on external conduct to align with the Dao of Heaven,\nTranscending to the primordial origin, one attains the rank of Supreme Immortal.\n\nOn the day when Master Quanzhen, Wa Zhang, attained the Dao, he composed the *Ci of Untying the Pendant*, saying:\nCultivators of the Way,\nYour meritorious efforts are no small matter.\nDiscern the reversal and inversion of the Five Phases,\nThe wondrous principle is profoundly abstruse.\nWithin the jade furnace, dragons coil and tigers crouch,\nIn the golden tripod, the supreme treasure is refined.\nThe yang spirit departs the body,\nVast and obscure,\nIn an instant, it roams the Three Isles.\nOnce entry and exit are mastered,\nRestrain and hold fast,\nSeek further mysteries,\nMerge with true emptiness—\nThe Great Void is the ultimate end.\n\nFive Secret Poems:\n\n**I**\nHiss and exhale—three feet, yet no trace,\nReleased and gathered swiftly as the wind.\nAmong a hundred thousand, select one or two,\nThis Dao is entrusted to you alone.\n\n**II**\nExtended like lightning, round as the moon,\nNot for men—do not draw near.\nTo realize Buddhahood or become a Perfected One,\nThese subtle wonders require a master.\n\n**III**\nSevering nails and cutting iron, dispelling delusion,\nThe wondrous use, freely applied, comes from the master.\nReturning at will, filling the sleeves,\nCherish and nurture it like a grandson.\n\n**IV**\nRadiance blazes, pressing upon the body,\nBones tremble, hairs stand on end—what is to be done?\nIf you are truly a man, you will not fear,\nWith a single flourish, the truth is revealed at once.\n\n**V**\nAmong a hundred thousand, one or two,\nA single flourish must align with the hearts of sages and worthies.\nThe Red Youth manifests divine auspices,\nWithered wood blooms, iron turns to gold.\n\n**Eulogy for the Portrait of the Pure Yang Immortal**\nSupreme virtue defies description,\nPrimordial merit governs nothing—\nWhat need for verses or praises?\nHeaven is impartial,\nOnly virtue is aided;\nThe sagely teacher is never far.\n\nWith the bearing of a phoenix and the essence of a dragon,\nA true Confucian of his generation,\nHis beard like a coiled dragon, his moon-like visage—\nA descendant of Tang officials.\nAwakened by the dream of yellow millet,\nHe severed the endless cycle of life and death.\nOnce the elixir was complete, he sought only to deliver others,\nHis rank exalted, ever aiding the drowning.\nIn the south, he refined gold lead and wood mercury;\nIn Bianjing, he tasted jade nectar and *suka*.\nSpreading the One Vibration to perfect the true,\nCountless living beings relied on his grace.\nWielding the Three Swords as admonitions,\nDark and countless disciples received his love.\nAt times, he wandered amidst white reeds and red dreams;\nAt times, he dwelled in the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.\nLetting go of all, he beheld the Great Void,\nYet still stood in attendance in the Hall of Luminous Understanding.\nThroughout the land, his noble demeanor was longed for,\nHis divine traces shone across the realm.\n\nMaster Guo on Mount Ao longed to return—\nThe master spoke of himself thus.\nDaoist Peng still awaited enlightenment—\nThis was Peng Chongyang.\n\nFor eons, I have been foolish and deluded,\nEntangled in habitual tendencies.\nSince gaining discernment,\nI have never measured my strength,\nIndulging in every pursuit—\nOnly the Dao of immortals and Buddhas\nHave I not yet inquired into.\n\nMy elder, Lord Yue Suchan of Changsha, a descendant of officials, shared my passion,\nAnd we became friends despite the difference in age.\nI knew he was a dharma-friend of Peng Chongyang and Hu Guchan,\nAll three having received the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir from Master Yuxi.\nOne day, as we spoke of the frontier,\nHe suddenly stood and spoke earnestly:\n\"In my daily visits to friends and searches for teachers,\nI have spared neither body nor life.\nLater, I met Master Yuxi,\nAnd though you and I have only shared simple affections and casual discourse,\nThe time for learning the Dao has its own causes and conditions.\nSince you have reached this point,\nThe time is now!\nWait for an auspicious day to transmit the teachings.\"\nThus, in the *chen* hour of the *jiazi* day,\nHe secretly imparted a few words,\nEncouraging me to try them out.",

      "translated_text": "Within less than a month, the elixir path proved efficacious—what was called \"golden light suffusing the body,\" \"jade towers and crimson palaces,\" \"dragon and tiger, infant and maiden,\" all appearing in a fleeting trance with vivid clarity. Upon hearing this, Master Yue stroked his tears and sighed: \"Since I first heard the Dao, my body has been plagued by fleshly ailments, preventing me from gathering my strength. Thus, I have yet to begin the work of stoking the fire. You, however, were born with immortal bones—this is no trifling matter. I dare not claim to be your teacher. Instead, I point to one among them who bears an uncanny resemblance to Master Yuxi. Simply don the robes and cap to capture the master’s likeness, and take him as your teacher. I now entrust you solemnly with all the master’s handwritten texts and these ten volumes.\"\n\nLater, I heard from the slightly acquainted Administrator Shu Zong: \"The master once stayed in my family’s home. When my father, the Pacification Commissioner, completed his term, we traveled together back to Huai, with the master lodging and dining in the kitchen boat, tethered by an iron chain to the stern of our vessel. As we neared Zhenzhou, a sudden storm arose, and the chain snapped—both boat and belongings vanished into the surging waves. Two days later, the master appeared at Yangzi Bridge, clutching a small bundle of clothes. As our boat was being woven together, he bid my father farewell in person before departing. Only then did we realize the master had attained the Dao of entering water without drowning. My family sighed in awe endlessly.\"\n\nSince receiving the transmission, fifty-five years have passed, and now, at ninety, I have labored to depict the immortal’s likeness at the end of the preface to these ten volumes, committing them to woodblocks to ensure their wide dissemination. On this day of the fourteenth year of the Zhizheng era, Wang Junzhang of Zhongyang, with incense lit, respectfully inscribes this.\n\n*Essential Pointers on the Elixir Classics of Master Yuxi, Volume the Lower* concludes.",
