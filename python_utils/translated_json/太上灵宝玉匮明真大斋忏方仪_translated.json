Through this repentance and gratitude, we beseech their complete eradication. May we cross the ford of the five burdens and be stricken from the ledgers of the nine darknesses. May we ascend the cloud paths of the divine, soaring upon the celestial thoroughfares. Refined and transformed by nature, may we roam freely in eternal joy. May auspicious blessings flow to the imperial lineage, bestowing prosperity upon the emperor’s person. May we lead the realm into great peace, dispelling the gloom of the hidden realms.
