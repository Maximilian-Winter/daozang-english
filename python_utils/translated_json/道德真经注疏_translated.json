  "full_translation": "**Daoist Classic of the *Dao De Jing* with Commentary**\n**Title:** *Dao De Jing* with Commentary\n**Original Attribution:** Attributed to Master Gu Xuan of Wu Commandery, though likely composed by a Song-era scholar.\n**Eight volumes.**\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngshén Bù* (Mystic Treasures Section), *Yùjué Lèi* (Jade Precepts Category); Supplementary: Dunhuang fragment S.4430.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of the *Dao De Jing* with Commentary**\n**Narrated by the Wu Commandery recluse Gu Xuan**\n\n**Chapter 1: The Dao that Can Be Spoken of**\n**Commentary:** This refers to the Dao as expounded in the *Jing* for the cultivation of political and religious teachings.\n\n**The Dao that Cannot Be Spoken of**\n**Commentary:** This is not the Dao of natural longevity and immortality.\n\n**The True Dao** (that cannot be spoken of) is to:\n- Nourish the spirit with non-action (*wúwéi*),\n- Keep the people at ease without affairs (*wúshì*),\n- Hold the luminous within and conceal its brilliance (*hán guāng cáng huī*),\n- Erase one’s traces and obscure one’s origin (*miè jì nì duān*),—\nso profound it cannot be named or described.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe term *Dao* signifies the principle of emptiness and fluidity (*xūtōng*), while *cháng* denotes the state of profound stillness (*zhànjì*). The **Dao of the Boundless** is the innate nature (*zhèngxìng*) of all beings. When it speaks of \"the Dao that can be spoken of,\" it refers to **named teachings**—the methods that can be articulated.\n\nThough it may be called \"the Dao that can be spoken of,\" one must adapt to circumstances (*suí jī qiè dàng*) and speak accordingly, yet it remains merely a manifestation of sound and discourse (*yǒu shēng yǒu shuō*), not the **true, immutable, and eternally still Dao**.\n\nThe **True Dao** transcends named teachings and cannot be grasped by thought or reasoning (*bùkě míngyán biàn*). Its subtlety is unparalleled (*miào zhuó xīyí*), its essence elusive to the point of bewilderment (*lǐ qióng huǎnghū*). Thus, only beyond the realm of words and symbols (*zhī yán xiàng zhī biǎo*) does one truly align with the **Dao of immutable stillness**.\n\nWhat can be spoken of and named is the **Dao that is not the True Dao**.\n\n**The Name that Can Be Named**\n**Commentary:** This refers to the **names of wealth, honor, and worldly eminence** (*fùguì zūnróng gāoshì zhī míng*).\n\n**The Name that Cannot Be Named**\n**Commentary:** This is not the **name of natural, eternal permanence**.\n\nThe **True Name** (that cannot be named) should be like:\n- The infant’s unspoken innocence (*yīngxiōng zhī wèiyán*),\n- The undivided egg (*jīzǐ zhī wèifēn*),\n- The pearl still within the oyster (*míngzhū zài bàng zhōng*),\n- The gemstone hidden in stone (*měiyù chǔ shíwèn*),—\nwhere its inner radiance is clear (*zhāozhāo*), yet its outer appearance is dull as ignorance (*wài rú wán yú*).\n\n**Exegesis:**\n**Name** is **teaching** (*jiào*). Earlier, the Dao that can be spoken of was expounded with utmost clarity (*shèng míng yú lǐ*). Now, the Name that can be named is a secondary revelation through teaching (*cì xiǎn yú jiào*). Since the True Dao transcends words and symbols, and even teaching surpasses mere discourse (*shuōshì*), the essence of the Dao and its teachings are **one without distinction** (*bùyī bùyì*).\n\nYet the **Supreme Dao** is too profound to measure (*bùkě yá liàng*), neither void nor existent (*fēiwú fēiyǒu*), neither fixed nor eternal (*bùduàn bùcháng*), yet it holds **nuanced distinctions** (*yì yǒu yìyáng*), and **teaching** accommodates both gradual and sudden methods (*jiào cún jiàndùn*). Thus, the True Dao is posited to transcend what can be named, hence the statement: *\"The Dao that can be named is not the True Dao.\"*\n\nWhen discourse reaches its utmost, it rests in **the realm of neither naming nor not naming** (*wúkě wúbùkě*). Therefore, the *Yùjīng Jing* (Jade Capital Scripture) states:\n*\"Neither naming nor not naming, thought merges with the subtlest essence.\"*\n\n**The Nameless**\n**Commentary:** The **Nameless** refers to the **Dao itself**, which has no form and thus cannot be named. **The Beginning** signifies the Dao’s emission of *qi* and manifestation of transformation (*tǔqì bùhuà*), arising from the **Void** (*xūwú*) as the primordial source of heaven and earth.\n\n**Exegesis by Master Wang:**\nThough the Dao is **Nameless**, it yet **emits *qi* and manifests transformation**, emerging from the **Void** to become the **origin of heaven, earth, and all things**.\n\n**Exegesis:**\n**The Beginning** is the **Source** (*běn*). The **Void and Nameless Dao** molds and refines all things (*táoyǒng zhōngwàn wù*), from the **Two Poles** (*èr yún*) to the **Three Manifestations** (*sān jǐng*), all deriving from it. Thus, the **Nameless** is the **root of all things**, and though it can be spoken of, its clarity is evident.\n\n**The Named**\n**Commentary:** The **Named** refers to **heaven and earth**, which possess form, position, yin and yang, and softness and hardness—these are their **Names**.\n\nThe **Mother of All Things** is heaven and earth, which contain *qi* and give birth to all things, nurturing them to growth and maturity, like a mother rearing her child.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe **Mother** has **form and traces** (*yǒu míng jì*). The **Dao of the Profound Void** originates as the **Nameless**, yet descending from its source, names and distinctions arise. Thus, the Sage establishes the **Named** to elucidate the **Nameless**, desiring to **nurture beings back to their origin**—through compassion and care (*cíbēi jūyǎng*), akin to a mother’s role.\n\n**Master Gu states:**\nThe **Named** refers to **yin and yang**, while the **Nameless** is the **True Dao**. The True Dao has no substance (*wú tǐ*), hence it is **Nameless**. Yin and yang are differentiated (*yǒu fēn*), hence they are **Named**.\n\n**The Beginning** is taken from its **timelessness** (*wú xiān*), while **Mother** is taken from its **function** (*yǒu gōng*). Timelessness renders the origin unsearchable (*běn bùkě xún*), while function makes its principle explicable (*qí lǐ kě shuō*). For yin and yang contain *qi* and give birth to all things, nurturing them to growth and maturity—like a mother rearing her child—hence they are called **Mother**.\n\n**Constantly without desire, one observes its subtlety.**\n**Commentary:** *Miao* means **essential unity** (*yào*). When one constantly remains without desire (*wú yù*), one can perceive the **core principle** of the Great Dao.\n\n**Essential unity** is **oneness** (*yī*), which issues forth and manifests transformation (*míng dào zàn shū*), distinguishing right and wrong (*míng shìfēi*).\n\n**Exegesis by Jiéshuò:**\nThis refers to **preserving the Void** (*shǒu xūwú*).\n\n**Exegesis:**\n*Miao* means **profound and refined** (*jīngwēi*). **Observation** is **illumination and scrutiny** (*zhào chá*). **Its** refers to **oneself** (*jǐ*). When one constantly remains without desire or action (*wú yù wúwéi*), in **absolute emptiness and stillness** (*zhì xū zhì jìng*), one can then **discern the subtleties of one’s own Dao** and **perceive the refined essence of ultimate principle**.\n\n**Constantly with desire, one observes its return.**\n**Commentary:** *Jiǎo* means **alignment** (*guī*). Those who constantly harbor desire (*yǒu yù*) can observe the **tendencies of the worldly realm**.\n\n**Master Yu states:**\nHumans are born in stillness (*jīng*), which is the **nature of Heaven**. When stirred by things (*gǎn wù*), they move—this is the **desire of nature**. If one constantly upholds **purity and stillness**, releases the mind and frees the spirit (*jiěxīn shìshén*), and reflects back upon one’s true nature (*fǎn zhào zhèngxìng*), then one observes the **refined origin**.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nWhen one cannot remain in **non-action and serenity** (*wúwéi tiándàn*), fails to **guard the refined and uphold the true**, but instead **arises with greed and indulges in worldly attachments** (*wàngqǐ tānqiú, sìqíng rǎnzhì*), one merely sees the **existence of worldly conditions** (*shìjìng zhī yǒu*), yet does not grasp the **emptiness of immediate existence** (*jìyǒu zhī kōng*). Thus, one fails to perceive the **refined essence of the Dao** and only witnesses the **alignment toward life and death**.\n\nEarlier, the distinction between the **Nameless and Named** was clarified; now, the **superiority of those without desire over those with desire** is revealed.\n\n**Master Zhang states:**\nThe **highest attainments** (*shàng dá zhī rén*) take and discard with equanimity (*qíngyí*), maintaining **purity and emptiness without desire** (*qīngxū wúyù*). Their **spirit and emotions** are illuminated and scrutinized (*shénqíng zhào chá*), thus they attain the **subtleties of the Dao**.\n\n**The two aspects** (of desire and non-desire) **emerge from the same source yet bear different names.**\n**Commentary:** The **two aspects** refer to **those with and without desire** (*yǒu yù wúyù*). **Same source** means they both arise from **human nature** (*tóng chū rén zhī xīn*). **Different names** signifies their **distinct outcomes** (*suǒ míng gèyì*).\n\nThose without desire endure, while those with desire perish their bodies.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe observed realm is singular, yet the observing wisdom varies—\nwhen these two modes of perception differ, their subtleties earn distinct names.\nThey are called **Dao/Way** together.\n**Note:** *Dao/Way* refers to **Heaven**.\n\nIt is said that those with desire and those without share the same origin in **Heaven’s qi**.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*Dao/Way* signifies depth and boundlessness, also a name for non-adherence.\nWith two minds—having and not having—both trace back to the same **Dao/Way**, emerging yet differing.\nThis differing yet singular **Dao/Way** is called **depth and boundlessness**.\nThe boundlessness of depth: its principle lies in non-adherence.\nNeither adhering to having nor to not-having—both non-adherence—\nthus it is called **Dao/Way**.\n**Dao/Way**, again **Dao/Way**,\n**Note:** *Heaven within Heaven.*\n\nIt is said that the reception of qi varies in thickness—\nthose who attain **harmony and nourishment** become sages and worthies,\nwhile those who receive **turbulence and impurity** become greedy and licentious.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThose with desire cling only to having,\nwhile those without desire cling to not-having—\nthus, **Dao/Way** is spoken of to dispel both fixations.\nYet fearing practitioners might cling to this **Dao/Way**,\nanother **Dao/Way** is spoken of to remove the later affliction.\nNow, not clinging to clinging nor to not-clinging—\nthis is dispelling again, hence **Dao/Way**, again **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Master Gu states:**\nThough all receive qi from Heaven,\nhumans differ in elevation, and qi in purity—\nHeaven is ever higher and purer, Earth ever lower and fouler.\nThose who receive pure qi become the wise and virtuous,\nwhile those who receive impure qi become the common and foolish.\nThe wise and virtuous are without desire, perceiving its subtleties.\nThe common and foolish are with desire, perceiving only its entanglements—\nthis is natural.\n**The Gateway to All Subtleties.**\n**Note:** To know that Heaven contains Heaven within it,\nthat the reception of qi varies in thickness—\nif one can eliminate emotions and desires,\nand abide in **harmony**,\nthis is called the **Gateway to Knowing the Dao**.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*Gateway* is the **Law-gate**.\nEarlier, with the singular **Dao/Way** of the center,\nthe dual fixations of the two extremes were dispelled.\nOnce the dual afflictions are removed,\nthe medicine of the center is itself dispelled—\nwhen medicine and affliction vanish together,\nthis is the utmost subtlety, exhausting principle and essence.\nIt is not merely the doorway of all sages,\nbut also the **Law-gate of all subtleties**.\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\n**Note:** *To exalt oneself, making it manifest.*\n\n**This evil is already present.**\n**Note:** There is peril and ruin.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*Heaven under Heaven* is the comprehensive name for the worldly realm. *Beauty* means delight and affection. The *Sutra of the Upper Primordial* states:\n*\"All beneath the heavens, all above the earth—\nwithin them dwell beings, called the worldly realm.\"*\nIt speaks of all living creatures, none who do not cling to dusty passions, falsely arising in beauty and ugliness. What contradicts the heart gives rise to resentment—this is called *evil*. What aligns with the will inevitably breeds attachment—this is called *beauty*.\nYet unaware that all dharmas are both existent and empty, beauty and ugliness being empty, what is there to love or hate?\n\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The fur-lined walls and lovely consorts—\nwhat mortals call beautiful—\nfish see them and dive deep,\nbirds see them and take flight.\nAgain, the beautiful deems itself beautiful,\nbut I do not know its beauty.\nThe ugly deems itself ugly,\nbut I do not know its ugliness.\"*\nBy this standard, where is there beauty or ugliness?\nThus, those in the world who cling to beauty as beauty—\nthis is itself the root of evil.\n\n**Gu says:**\nAll beings know they indulge in the beauty of sensory objects—\nthe five desires, sounds, colors, and all dusty passions—\nand this unceasing beauty brings suffering to the body.\nThus, this evil is already present.\n\n**This goodness is already present.**\n**Note:** There is fame and status.\n\n**This non-goodness is already present.**\n**Note:** It is what people contend for.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe vulgar masses, lost in true principle,\nnot only indulge in lust and color\nbut also covet fame and reputation,\npursuing name at the cost of life,\nserving self while harming others,\nunaware that fame and virtue are hollow constructs.\nThus the text below asks: *Which is closer to you, name or body?*\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To do good without seeking fame,\nand again, what they prize and spare—\nnothing but fame and virtue.\"*\nThus, it is clear that clinging to fame and virtue\ncontradicts true principle.\nOnly by forgetting good and evil and abiding in the center\ndoes one attain the Way of *wuwei*.\n\n**Luo says:**\nAll beings, receiving form,\ncherish their bodies and crave fame—\nwhat they treasure is nothing but fame and virtue.\nThis \"goodness\" without goodness\nonly invites suffering.\nThough fame may be attained,\nwhat benefit does it bring to oneself?\n\n**Being and non-being generate each other.**\n**Note:** Seeing being as non-being.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe two names, *being* and *non-being*,\narise interdependently.\nPursuing principle to its end,\nthey are both empty in essence.\nOnce it is known that being and non-being generate each other,\nit is clear that all dharmas are without substance.\n\n**Wang says:**\nCraving desire is the mind of *having*;\nemptiness and stillness are the mind of *non-being*.\n\n**Difficulty and ease arise together.**\n**Note:** Seeing difficulty as ease.\n\n**Commentary:**\nWith a mind of emptiness and wisdom,\nthere is neither ease nor difficulty.\nWith discriminating attachment,\nthere is both ease and difficulty.\nThus, the two dharmas of difficulty and ease\nmutually arise and depend on each other.\n\n**Wang says:**\nTo suppress nature is difficult;\nto follow desire is easy.\nTo suppress ease and follow difficulty is good;\nto abandon difficulty and follow ease is disastrous.\nDisaster and perversity manifest outwardly—\nthus it is said they arise together.\n\n**Long and short define each other.**\n**Note:** Seeing shortness as length.\n\n**Commentary:**\nTo measure length by length reveals no length;\nto compare shortness with shortness reveals no shortness.\nThus it is said that long and short define each other.\n\n**Wang says:**\nSelf is length, others are short—\neach is self and not the other.\n\n**High and low topple each other.**\n**Note:** Seeing high as low.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*Topple* means to usurp.\nWhere there is high, there must be low;\nwithout low, there is no high.\nHow so?\nCompare a *chi* with a *cun*—\nthe *chi* becomes high,\ncompare a *zhang* with a *chi*—\nthe *chi* becomes low.\nWhat was once high is now low—\nthus it is clear that high and low have no fixed nature,\nmutually usurping, all empty.\n\n**Sounds harmonize each other.**\n**Note:** When one sings above, the other must respond below.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe five tones and bamboo pipes\nharmonize to form music.\nPursuing their intrinsic nature,\nthey are all empty in essence.\nBy analogy, all phenomena are likewise empty and false.\n\n**Before and after follow each other.**\n**Note:** When one moves above, the other must follow below.**\n\n「○Commentary: When one looks back from today to the past, today exists because of the past; when one looks forward from the past to today, the past is named because of today. Yet today is not truly today—how could it give rise to the past? The past is not truly the past—how could it give rise to today? Since there is neither past nor present, what is before or after? Thus, it is known that though there are before and after, the three times follow one another yet have no ultimate substance.\n\n○Master Wang said: Beginning and end pursue each other, never far apart—like accumulating virtue yields blessings, accumulating vice invites calamity. Good and evil act in the present, while fortune and misfortune follow in their wake.\n\nThus, the Sage governs through *wuwei* (non-action).\n**Note:** Governance through the Dao.\n**Explanation:** This means naturalness.\n\n○Commentary: The Sage is one who embodies the Dao and aligns with the True. \"Sage\" also means \"rectified\"—able to rectify oneself and, in turn, others. Therefore, they are called Sage. This Sage, with compassion and mercy, rescues all beings, upholding the wondrous law of *wuwei* to govern the desiring masses. The governance is near—referring to the ability to govern mentioned earlier, which belongs to the Sage. Continuing from before, it states: Thus, the Sage governs through *wuwei*, being still yet active, active yet still, still yet active, and through *wuwei* yet able to act.\n\nActive yet still—this means, in the world, not abandoning *wuwei*. Thus, *wuwei* is indeed action, and action is indeed *wuwei*. How could there be distinctions between marketplace and mountain valley, or separations between bowing in silence and governing the world? Hence, it is said to govern through *wuwei*.\n\nPracticing the teaching of *wu* (non-speech);\n**Note:** Leading by personal example.\n\n○Commentary: The wondrous embodiment of the True Source transcends speech and form. Though dwelling in stillness, its transformations are boundless. Not only does the True not contradict response, but speech does not hinder silence. Having emerged from speech and silence, their essence is one. Silent and composed, yet filling the world with influence—how could one say the Sage \"does not speak\" by sealing the lips? Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"One who speaks sufficiently can speak all day and exhaust the Dao; one who speaks insufficiently can speak all day and exhaust things.\"*\n\nAll things arise,\n**Note:** Each moves spontaneously.\nyet without complaint.\n**Note:** Not repelling or obstructing.\n\n○Commentary: All things are all living beings. *Action* means response and movement. *Beginning* means first. The Sage, without intention, responds to stimuli—like a clear mirror or an empty valley. Responding only after being moved, not acting before things, hence *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Ever harmonious yet never leading.\"*\n\nBringing forth yet not possessing,\n**Note:** The Original Qi gives rise to all things yet does not possess them.\nacting yet not relying,\n**Note:** The Dao’s actions are not done with expectation of reward.\n\n○Commentary: *Relying* means depending on. The great Sage, with an empty heart, seizes opportunities to benefit beings, treating self and others equally, forgetting both self and others. Though achieving great deeds, they never depend on them, forgetting their accomplishments.\n\nWhen deeds are complete, they do not dwell upon them.\n**Note:** When deeds are done and affairs settled, they withdraw, not claiming position.\n\n○Commentary: Covering and nourishing all things, their deeds reach heaven and earth, illuminating the people with brilliance surpassing the sun and moon—yet they attribute their deeds to others, not dwelling in their virtue.\n\nOnly because they do not dwell upon it,\n**Note:** Only because their deeds are complete and they do not claim position,\nis it that it does not depart from them.\n**Note:** Their blessings and virtue remain ever-present.\n\nThis speaks of the Sage’s non-action, which cannot be followed; their non-speech, which cannot be known. The previous six lines—high and low, long and short—Master Wang opens one source, from which a hundred branches arise. The transformations of these hundred branches never fail to bring chaos.\n\n○Commentary: *Fu* marks the beginning of speech; *wei* emphasizes uniqueness. Only the Sage creates and transforms heaven and earth, nurtures all sentient beings, achieves great deeds, yet attributes them to others. Who but the Sage could do this? Because they recognize their deeds, their great deeds are ever distant, their Sage virtue ever present—thus it does not depart.\n\nNot elevating the worthy,\n**Note:** The \"worthy\" refers to worldly scholars—eloquent in speech, skilled in texts, yet detached from the Dao, prioritizing form over substance.\n\nNot elevating means not honoring them with rank or office.\n**Explanation:** Master Wang says: Elevating the worthy creates distinctions; following distinctions sparks contention. Thus, the people do not contend.\n\n**Note:** Not contending over fame and position, returning to naturalness.\n\n○Commentary: This does not mean the ruler does not value the worthy. It is that people practice humility, placing others before themselves, not exalting themselves while belittling others. Speaking of \"not contending\"—if everyone exalts themselves while belittling others, then vain competition flourishes. If all retreat from self and prioritize others, then contention naturally ceases.\n\nNot treasuring difficult-to-obtain goods,\n**Note:** The ruler does not hoard treasures—gold abandoned in mountains, pearls cast into abysses.\n\nThus, the people do not steal;\n**Note:** The ruler’s purity descends, so the people have no desire for noble things.\n\n**Explanation:** This means evil *qi* does not arise, thieves do not enter. A single firm grasp dispels evil *qi*.\n\n○Commentary: Difficult-to-obtain goods refer to treasures like Zhao pearls and Jing jade. If treasures are universally prized, thieves will arise. If treasures are universally despised, petty thefts will not occur. Hence, it is said there is no theft.\n\nNot seeing what is desirable,\n**Note:** Banishing *Zheng* music, distancing flatterers.\n\n**Explanation:** This means *wuwei*.\n\nThus, the heart does not become disordered.\n**Note:** No licentiousness.\n\n**Explanation:** Ever maintaining the One.\n\n○Commentary: What is desirable refers to worldly sights and sounds—objects of greed and attachment. The Sage does not see them—not because they block the ears, but because the wondrous embodiment perceives the emptiness of dust and phenomena, finding no true desirable objects. Exhausting the roots of dust, they do not align, hence no desire arises. Since there are no desirable objects, the ears and eyes wander freely, yet the heart remains ever empty and still. Thus, it is said the heart does not become disordered.\n\nHence, the *Xisheng Jing* says: *\"Like shadows in a mirror—visible yet untouchable.\"* It also says: *\"To see is to see nothing; to listen is to hear nothing.\"* The previous statements on non-contention and non-theft are specific; this statement on not seeing what is desirable is comprehensive, dispelling the three activities and all phenomena. It solely reveals the Sage’s empty heart benefiting beings.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance—whether of the realm or of the self—\n*○节解 (Jiejie)* says: *\"Of the self, it means:*\nTo empty the heart, to fill the belly—\n*○注 (Zhù)*: *to discard cravings and dispel distractions.*\nTo embrace the Dao/Way and hold to the One, to preserve the Five Spirits.\n*○御 (Yù)*: *The heart, undisturbed by desirable objects, is thus emptied.*\n\n*○节解 (Jiejie)* says: *\"To empty the heart is to have no wicked thoughts.*\nTo fill the belly is to close the qi and nurture the essence.*\n\n*○郭 (Guō)*: *When all evil is transformed and exhausted, all virtues arise naturally.*\nTo embrace the Dao/Way and hold to the One is to maintain purity and harmony within—\n*○疏 (Shū)*: *Having no desirable objects without, and no desiring heart within,*\nThe heart and its objects both forgotten—\n*○疏*: *This is the state of \"heart without heart.\"*\nThough the external realm be illusory and the heart be emptied,\nYet there remains a luminous awareness—\nSo it is said, *\"The wondrous embodiment perceives emptiness yet responds without distinction,\"*\nAnd *\"virtue is full within.\"*\nTo weaken the will—\n*○注 (Zhù)*: *to soften, yield, and humble oneself,*\nNot to seek power or dominance.\n*○御 (Yù)*: *When the heart is emptied, the will naturally weakens.*\n\n*○疏*: *Though the inner self is filled with wisdom,*\nThe outer self expands to meet all beings,\nIn the world yet unsoiled by dust—\n*○疏*: *Gentle and yielding, retreating from strife.*\n\nTo strengthen the bones—\n*○注 (Zhù)*: *to cherish essence and value qi,*\nSo the bones are full and firm.\n*○御 (Yù)*: *When the belly is filled, the bones naturally grow strong.*\n*○顾 (Gù)*: *Bones rely on containing essence;*\nWhen essence is scattered, the bones grow weak.\nPreserving essence and valuing qi—\nThen the bones naturally strengthen.\n\n*○床化 (Chuáng Huà)*: *The Sage, though outwardly demonstrating harmony and brightness,*\nRemains inwardly ever still and undisturbed.\nTo make clear that movement does not harm emptiness,\nAnd response does not depart from truth—\nThus it is said, *\"To strengthen the bones.\"*\n\nEver keep the heart in ignorance and without desire—\n*○注 (Zhù)*: *returning to simplicity and guarding purity.*\n\n**○御 says:**\n*To reject contention and curb the knowing,*\n*To sever greed and extinguish desire.*\n\n**○疏:**\n*Knowing* refers to the distinctions of sound and name,\n*Desire* is the label for avarice and seeking.\nIt speaks of how the Sage, ever empty yet benefiting the people,\nTurns upside-down ones away from divisive thoughts,\nQuells the vulgar’s greedy cravings.\nThus, those who know dare not act.\n\n**注:**\n*Deep in thought, speaking not lightly.*\n\n**To act without action,**\n**注:**\n*Not contriving, moving only in accordance with the Way.*\n\n**Then nothing remains ungoverned.**\n**注:**\n*Virtue’s cultivation is pure; the people dwell in peace.*\n\n**○疏:**\nHaving already abandoned desire in seeking non-desire,\nYet fearing those without desire might stagnate in empty views,\nThe Way of non-action is spoken of—\nYet to say *\"dare not act\"* is to dispel non-desire.\nFearful of clinging to this *\"not acting,\"*\nThus it follows with *\"dare not\"* as well.\n\n*Governance* means rectification;\nIf one but first dispels having-desire,\nThen dispels non-desire,\nThis is the double-dispelling of the two extremes,\nThe wondrous embodiment of the One Way,\nWhere self and other merge,\nAnd phenomena and wisdom both vanish—\nThus governance, with nothing left unrectified.\n\n**The Way is void yet applied,**\n**注:**\n*Void—this means central.*\nThe Way conceals itself in name, its use lies within.\n\n*A household says:*\n*The Way’s use lies in its void and harmony—*\nThus it is called *void.*\n\n**○饰解 says:**\n*Void* means *one*—\nThat the One abides within, ever acting.\n\n**Or it does not overflow.**\n**注:**\n*Or*—always.\nThe Way is ever modest, never full.\n\n**○饰解 says:**\n*This means guarding stillness.*\n\n**○疏:**\nThe Sage’s transformations are manifold;\nNo words are more fitting than *\"central\"*—\nThus, *\"The Way is void yet applied.\"*\nThis is to take *centrality* as use,\nYet to say *\"or it does not overflow\"*—\nToward the One Central Way,\nBreaking the two extremes,\nOnce the extremes are removed, the One returns to dispelment.\n\nNow, lest those who cling to teaching\nDwell in the One Centrality,\nAnd take it as fullness—\nTo say *\"does not overflow\"* is to dispel the meaning of *centrality.*\n\n**Deep, like the source of all things.**\n**注:**\n*The Way’s depth is unfathomable—*\nLike the ancestral root of all things.\n\n**○疏:**\n*Deep*—still water.\nTo liken the Sage’s words:\nStill water can reflect people,\nSage-wisdom illuminates all dharmas—\nThus the Master Carpenter takes his measure from still water,\nAll beings find their ultimate in the Sage—\nYet it is called *\"like\"*:\nTo clarify that there is no fixed source,\nYet the source is sourced.\n\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"No one mirrors in flowing water,\nBut all mirror in still water.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Still water is clear and deep—*\nThe Great Teacher’s ultimate essence.\"*\n\n**To blunt its sharpness,**\n**注:**\n*Blunt*—to

Though they see only the *xuányuán* (the primal yellow of the cosmos) and the *jūyù* (jade-like radiance of the Dao), the brilliance of the Godly Spirit is lost, and the five colors’ dazzling glare obscures all else—so the eyes are blind.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black.\nIt states that one cannot internally illuminate the true source of existence, yet externally pursues fleeting sensory realms. Though they see the illusory colors of the world, they remain unaware of the formless *color*—so what difference is there between blindness and this?\n\nFive tones deafen the ears,\n*[Note:]* Delight in the five tones scatters harmonious *qi*, preventing one from hearing the soundless *sound*—thus, the ears grow deaf.\n\n**[Node Solution]:** It does not mean the ears are physically deaf, but that one’s own hearing is dulled. Though they hear only the clamor of bells and drums, they fail to perceive the Godly Spirit’s voice—so it is called deafness of the ears.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The five tones are *gōng* (yellow bell), *shāng* (major second), *jué* (minor third), *zhǐ* (major fourth), and *yǔ* (major fifth).\nWhen the mind indulges in strings and pipes, the ears become clogged by the five tones, unable to return and listen to the subtle *sound* of the Dao—so it is called deafness.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: It is not only the body that has blindness and deafness, but the mind as well.\n\n**[Wang Bi’s Commentary]:** If one is ensnared by them, then licentious sounds will harm the Godly Spirit and disrupt the true nature. When one’s speech is filled with lamentation and sorrow, it is the same as being deaf.\n\n**[Gu Xuan and Shi Le’s Commentary]:** Though they hear only discordant clamor, it is still called not being deaf—yet they fail to recognize that the true nature of sound is emptiness, and thus are no different from the deaf.\n\nFive flavors make the mouth insensible,\n*[Note:]* *Shuāng* (insensible) is the same as *wáng* (lost).\nIndulgence in the five flavors leads to reckless speech, straying from the Dao.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The five flavors are sweet, bitter, sour, pungent, and salty.\n*Shuāng* means deviation and loss. When one indulges in rich delicacies and savors the rank, they cannot taste the Dao’s essence or discuss its mysteries—so it is called insensibility of the mouth.\n\nThose who indulge in reckless pursuits and hunting,\nTheir minds grow deranged.\n\n*[Note:]* The human spirit prefers tranquility; if one gallops and breathes wildly, the spirit scatters and dissipates—so the mind grows deranged.\n\n**[Node Solution]:** It refers to the dead returning to the earth, their kin lamenting in sorrow, while the living rush about in haste, weeping and wailing. The departed are buried in tombs, the living scatter in the fields, the close kin are deranged with grief, the distant kin are sorrowful—so it is said that their minds grow deranged.\n\n**[Imperial Annotation]:** Those who chase after worldly affairs, clinging to artificial actions, like hunters who seek only to slay, wage daily battles with their minds, racing after sensory realms—when they pause to reflect, they are struck by madness.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** *Chíchéng* (reckless pursuits) is akin to *zǒuzòu* (rushing about). Hunters, driven by greed, chase after beasts, their hearts wild and unrestrained—like madmen. Those who invert the Dao’s principles, their desires chase after sensory realms, swift as galloping steeds, their minds as deranged as hunters.\n\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: There are five ways to lose one’s true nature—one of which is when the five colors blind the eyes, preventing them from seeing clearly.\n\nHard-to-obtain treasures bring hindrance to one’s conduct.\n*[Note:]* *Fáng* (hindrance) is the same as *shāng* (harm).\nHard-to-obtain treasures—such as the *Zhào Bì* (Bi of Zhao) and *Suí Zhū* (Pearl of Suí), precious gold, silver, jade, and pearls—when one’s heart covets them and their mind desires them without knowing contentment, then their conduct brings harm to their body and disgrace to their name.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Fine and beautiful things, when one clings to and indulges in them, become the cause of birth and death. Within the path of cultivating the Dao, they greatly obstruct progress.\nThus, the Sage holds to the *fù* (abdomen),\n*[Note:]* Guarding the five *xìng* (nature/essence), eliminating the six *qíng* (emotions), moderating the *zhìqì* (intentional *qi*), and nurturing the Godly Spirit.\n\nAnd does not indulge the eyes,\n*[Note:]* The eyes should not gaze wantonly, for wanton gazing scatters vital essence outward.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Thus, following the previous text—\nThe Sage embodies the sacred precepts: whatever is within the abdomen, whatever is external to the eyes, they embrace the Dao and cultivate its *virtue/power*, filling their inner being. Therefore, they hold to the abdomen.\nInternally, they perceive the formless *color*; they return to listen to the soundless *sound*. All sensory faculties are empty and pure, untouched by dusty realms—so they do not indulge the eyes.\n\nThus, they abandon the former and take the latter.\n*[Note:]* Abandoning the eyes’ wanton gazing, taking the abdomen’s nurturing of the Godly Spirit.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Abandoning the ears and eyes’ blindness and deafness, taking the abdomen’s true wisdom.\n\nFavor and disgrace are like sudden alarm,\n*[Note:]* Both receiving honor and enduring humiliation bring alarm.\n\n**[Imperial Annotation]:** When one clings to them, they are filled with dread; when one is bound by them, they are filled with sorrow. Not having set their minds to honor or disgrace, they are both alarming.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Favor refers to the name of glory and love; disgrace refers to the shame of punishment. *Ruò* (like) means *as*; *jīng* (alarm) means *fear*.\nWhen one receives favor, they grow idle and joyful; when one suffers disgrace, they are startled and troubled in spirit—so receiving favor fills the heart with alarming joy, while enduring disgrace fills the heart with alarming dread.\nThough joy and fear differ, they are both forms of alarm—so it is said that they are like alarm.\n\nYet the emotions of joy and fear are not the true nature—so those who attain the Dao liken poverty and wealth to the cold and heat of the seasons, compare honor and disgrace to the coming and going of fortune, and remain unshaken by death and life—what then is the power of honor and disgrace to alarm them?\n\nGreat misfortune is like the body itself.\n*[Note:]* *Guì* (great) means *fear*; *ruò* (like) means *until*.\nOne fears great misfortune until it reaches the body—so it is alarming.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Great refers to noble rank, but also to one who forgets their body in their own nobility. It refers to afflictions such as worries, old age, and illness.\nCommon people only know to boast of their own bodies, yet fear great misfortune—unaware that great misfortune is their very body. They seek nourishment and sustenance, yet ultimately return to decay and ruin. So to fear the body is to fear great misfortune, and to fear great misfortune is to fear the body—both are rooted in the body itself.\n\n**[Cai’s Commentary]:** Those who cling to the body are attached to their own form, unable to let go or forget. They worry over their body’s labor, fear its hunger and cold, and ponder its decay—this is great misfortune. Thus, it is known that clinging to existence brings suffering, and preserving the body is the root of all misfortune. Those who fear their own body are no different from those who fear great misfortune.»\n\nThus the *Xi Sheng Jing* says:\n*\"The body is the root of affliction—pain, itch, cold, and heat—\nthe origin of great misfortune, arising from clinging to the body.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *honor and disgrace*?\n**Note:** *Honor* refers to exaltation and dignity; *disgrace* refers to shame upon the body.\nThis is a self-directed inquiry to awaken understanding in others.\n\nHonor is lowly,\n**Note:** *Honor and disgrace* are both base.\nTo gain it is like a shock,\n**Note:** Those who gain honor in shock—\nlike one in high station fearing peril—\nnoble yet dare not be arrogant, wealthy yet dare not be extravagant.\nTo lose it is like a shock.\n**Note:** *Loss* means losing favor and suffering disgrace.\n*Shock* means fearing that calamity will return.\n\n**Jie’s Explanation:** It means that when one attains the Dao, all spirits gather within the abdomen, murmuring and conversing with one’s children—knowing that the five spirits and vital *qi* flow freely, hence *\"to gain it is like a shock.\"* To lose it is like a shock means that when *qi* is lost and essence depleted, the spirits stagnate and one part fails—hair turns white, teeth fall out, and death comes, while mourners wail and call the soul from the roof, shocked by the heavenly spirits—hence *\"to lose it is like a shock.\"*\n\n**Cushion:** The world is inverted, valuing honor as supreme, while wisdom sees it as base. Why? Because gaining honor brings startled joy, losing it brings startled dread—both shocks stem from the same *honor*, hence it is lowly.\n\nThis is called *\"honor and disgrace as shock.\"*\n\n**Note:** Explaining *\"to gain it is like a shock, to lose it is like a shock.\"*\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:** Honor and disgrace cycle—honor is the root of disgrace.\nOrdinary minds are deluded, shocked by disgrace yet not by honor.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"fearing great misfortune as the body\"*?\n**Note:** Returning to self-inquiry—why fear great misfortune as the body?\nMy great misfortune arises because I have a body.\n**Note:** My great misfortune comes from having a body—\nto labor over it, to fear hunger and cold,\nto indulge emotions and desires—\nthus inviting calamity.\n\n**Cushion:** This answers the prior question.\nClinging to the body, unable to forget it,\nworrying over its labor, its hunger, its cold—\nthis is great misfortune.\nThus, those who prize the body are no different from those who prize misfortune.\n\nHence the *Xi Sheng Jing* says:\n*\"The body is the root of affliction—pain, itch, cold, and heat—\nI am bound by the body, knowing it as great misfortune—\nthis is its reality.*\nWhen I have no body, what misfortune do I have?\n**Note:** If I have no body, attaining the Dao naturally,\nlightly ascending to the clouds, entering and exiting without hindrance,\ncommuning with the Dao and spirits—\nwhat misfortune could there be?\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:** If one knows that heaven and earth harmonize without being mine,\ndetaching from form and discarding intellect,\nrealizing the body is not the body,\nuniting with the Great Way—\nwhat misfortune could there be?\n\n**Jie’s Explanation:** Forgetting the body to nourish the spirit is called *\"no body.\"*\n\n**Cushion:** *\"No\"* here means *sitting-forgetfulness*, losing the self,\nenjoying the body while detached from form—\nthus the body has no body,\nnot annihilation but transcendence.\n\nThus, those who prize the body as the world’s master\nmay temporarily rely on the world,\n**Note:** Those who exalt their body while belittling others,\ndesiring to rule the world,\ncan establish themselves but not endure.\n**Cushion:** Unaware that the body is great misfortune,\nthey cling to it, exalting themselves,\nalways seeking to dominate others—\nsuch people may briefly dwell in the world\nbut cannot long govern it.\n\nThose who love the body as the world’s master\nmay truly entrust themselves to the world.\n**Note:** Those who love their body not for themselves\nbut as parents to all people—\nif a ruler governs with this virtue,\nthey may entrust their body to the people above,\nenduring without blame.\n\n**Cushion:** *Rely* means temporary dwelling;\n*entrust* means enduring commitment—\nspeaking of preserving and cherishing the body without reckless indulgence.\nWith humility to govern oneself,\nyielding and following others,\nthey may transform and entrust themselves to the world—\nhence the *De Jing* says: *\"Love yourself but do not exalt yourself.\"*\n\nThat which cannot be seen is called *yi*,\n**Note:** *Yi*—without color—\nspeaking of absolute uniformity,\nunable to be perceived by sight.\n**Cushion:** *Yi* means level—\nthe Dao’s subtlety cannot be grasped by the five colors,\nhence it cannot be seen.\nIf it had color, it would be uneven—\nonly without color is it perfectly level.\n\nThat which cannot be heard is called *xi*,\n**Note:** *Xi*—without sound—\nspeaking of absolute silence,\nunable to be perceived by hearing.\n**Cushion:** *Xi* means sparse—\nits essence is not the five tones,\nhence it cannot be heard by the ear.\n\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *wei*.\n**Note:** *Wei*—without form—\nspeaking of absolute formlessness,\nunable to be held or touched.\n**Yu’s Commentary:** *Wei* means subtle.\nThe Dao has no shape, hence cannot be grasped.\nYet within its formlessness, it manifests—\nthus it is called *wei*.\n\n**Cushion:** *Wei* means subtle—\nits essence is not material,\nhence cannot be touched or held.\n\n**Zang’s Commentary:** When speaking of *yi, xi, wei*,\nit refers to *jing, shen,* and *qi*—\n*jing* is the name for luminous wisdom,\n*shen* is the name for unfathomable function,\n*qi* is the name for form and appearance—\nthese three are unified as one.\n\nThe Sage does not see this *jing*,\ndoes not hear this *shen*,\ndoes not grasp this *qi*.\nSince it cannot be seen, heard, or grasped,\nit should be called *without color, without sound, without form*—\nyet why speak of *yi, xi, wei*?\n\nThe Supreme Dao, though called *without color*,\nis not utterly nonexistent—\nif utterly nonexistent, it would be like the Great Void,\nleading to nihilistic views.\nNow it is clarified:\n*Without color yet colored*,\n*without sound yet sounding*,\n*without form yet forming*—\nhence it is called *yi, xi, wei*.\n\nThe so-called **Three-in-One**—\nthese three cannot be defined or explained.\n**Annotation:** The three refer to *yi, xi, wei*.\n\nThat which cannot be defined or explained is *without color, without sound, without form*,\nwords cannot describe it,\nscript cannot transmit it—\none must **receive it in stillness**,\n**seek it with the Dao/Way**,\nit cannot be forced through definition or inquiry to be obtained.\nHence, they are merged as one.\n**Annotation:** *Hun* means \"to blend\" or \"to unite.\"\nThus, they are united in three names yet one.\n\n**Exegesis:** When true and responsive, it scatters one as three;\nwhen responsive and true, it blends three into one—\none and three, three and one, are not different,\nhence it cannot be defined.\n\n**Further Explanation:** This true and responsive duality manifests as the Three Vehicles,\nthe meaning of which is fully expounded in the *Opening Topic Scroll*.\n\nIts uppermost aspect is **unfading**,\n**Annotation:** Saying one exists in the heavens above,\nyet its radiance is not **glittering and bright**.\n\nIts lowermost aspect is **unobscured**,\n**Annotation:** Saying one exists in the mortal realm below,\nyet it is not **darkened and clouded**,\nillustrating the Dao’s infinite reach above and below.\n**Exegesis:** The Supreme Dao is subtle and profound,\nneither foolish nor wise—\nascending beyond the Three Pure Ones,\nit does not **augment its clarity**,\ndescending into the Nine Abysses,\nit does not **add to its darkness**,\nas it is said: **\"neither increasing nor diminishing\"**,\nis this not so?\n\n**Endless and nameless**,\n**Annotation:** *Shéngshéng* means \"endless motion.\"\nThat which is nameless is not a single hue—\nit cannot be distinguished as **blue, yellow, red, white, or black**;\nnot a single sound—\nit cannot be heard as **the six tones** (官商角征羽);\nnot a single form—\nit cannot be measured by **length, shortness, size, or smallness**.\n\n**Exegesis:** The Dao penetrates into the skin, flesh, bones, and joints,\nhence it is said: **endless and nameless**.\n\nReturning again to **the Great Void**,\n**Annotation:** *Wu* means \"substance\" or \"essence.\"\nIt must be returned to **that which lacks essence**.\n\n**Exegesis:** *Shéngshéng* means \"rectitude,\" akin to the meaning of *string and ink*.\nThe Sage, though able to **self-rectify**,\ncan also **rectify others**,\nthus the endless and nameless cannot be grasped by name or sought by logic,\nhence it is nameless.\n\n**Further Explanation:** *Shéngshéng* depicts **motion and transformation**,\nsaying the Supreme Dao **turns and transforms** heaven and earth,\n**molds and nurtures** living beings,\nyet sight and hearing cannot trace it—\nhence it is nameless.\n\nReturning again means **reverting to the source**,\nthe Great Void is the **wondrous origin**.\nWhen responding to circumstances and descending to guide,\nit becomes **visible and audible**;\nwhen reverting to its root origin,\nit is **without name or form**.\nHence, it is said: **returning again to the Great Void**.\n\nThis is called **the form of the formless**,\n**Annotation:** Saying one lacks shape and form,\nyet it can **give shape and form to all things**.\n\nThis is called **the image of the substance-less**,\n**Annotation:** Saying one lacks material essence,\nyet it can **establish forms and appearances for all things**.\n\n**Exegesis:** The wondrous origin is subtle and profound,\nhence called **the formless**.\nIt leaves no trace of substance,\nyet can **generate all things**,\nhence it is called **the form of the formless** and **the image of the substance-less**.\n\nThis is called **dim and indistinct**,\n**Annotation:** Saying one is **dimly present and indistinctly absent**,\nneither fully here nor fully gone—\nit cannot be described.\n\n**Exegesis:** The Dao is **not fixed in existence or nonexistence**,\nresponse is not **fixed in absence or presence**,\nneither absent nor present,\nyet **absent yet present**,\nits presence and absence are indeterminate—\nhence it is called **dim and indistinct**.\n\nWhen **welcomed**, it is **not seen in its beginning**,\n**Annotation:** One lacks **start and end**,\nand **cannot be anticipated**.\n\n「When one discards emotions and renounces desires,\none returns to the self—**the Way of Oneness** with one’s true nature.\n**Annotation:** The *Dao* is the **form without substance**,\nsaying it is **comprehensible in appearance yet not in reality**,\nfor though it lacks material form, it manifests in response to all things.\nIf one were to say it **has** form, its shape is unseen;\nif one were to say it **lacks** form, all things arise from it.\n\n**Master Gu** says: Its coming is **unforeseen**,\nsuddenly present yet **unseen in its beginning**—\nhence the saying, **\"when welcomed, one does not see its start.\"**\n\n**Annotation:** It is **neither fixed in ancient nonexistence nor in modern termination**;\n**Annotation:** The Dao is **not ancient without beginning**,\nnor is it **modern without end**.\nOne follows it and **finds no trace**—\nit cannot be seen.\n**Master Gu** says: The Dao **has no beginning**,\nhence when welcomed, one does not see its start.\nThe Dao **has no end**,\nhence when followed, one does not see its conclusion.\n**Annotation:** The Dao is **not modern without end**;\n**Annotation:** **Master Gu** says: Its departure **leaves no trace**,\nmixed and boundless.\n\nThe **Sage holds the ancient Dao**,\nto **govern all things in the present**.\n**Annotation:** The Sage **clasps the ancient Dao**,\n**the Way of Non-action**, to **govern the present world of action**—\nthus returning to **primordial simplicity and purity**.\n**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **\"Holds\"** means **\"preserves.\"**\nThe Sage **preserves the Dao of the Great Ancient**,\n**the Way without name**, and **refines the present age**.\n**Master Gu** says: Though ancient and modern differ,\nthe Dao remains **constant and enduring**.\nOnly those who **grasp it** can **govern all things**.\nTo **know the ancient beginning** is called **the Dao’s framework**.\n**Annotation:** When one **knows the Dao of the Upper Ancient**,\n**the beginning of the Way without name**,\nthis is called **grasping the fundamental principles of the Dao**.\n\n**Annotation:** The ancient beginning is **the Way without name**;\nif one knows **the beginningless and endless Dao**,\nyet **both beginning and ending**—\nneither ancient nor modern,\nyet **both ancient and modern**—\nand **applies the ancient Dao** to **govern the present world**,\none may truly be said to **grasp the Dao’s fundamental framework**.\n**Master Gu** says: The Sage **preserves the ancient Dao of Non-action**,\n**governing the present world of action**,\n**calming the restless customs of the age**,\nand **returning to the ancient simplicity and purity**.\n**Refining and tempering** the transformations—\nthis is **attaining the Dao’s framework**.\n\nIn the ancient times, those who **excelled in the Way of the Sage**,\n**Annotation:** Referring to **the Sage who governs the Way**;\n**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **\"Ancient\"** means **\"of old,\"**\n**\"excelled\"** means **wise and virtuous**,\n**\"for\"** means **to cultivate and study**.\nThe previous chapter **clarified holding the ancient to govern the present**,\nand this **applies governing the present to draw upon the ancient**,\nhence **citing those of old who cultivated the Way with wisdom**,\nto **establish a model for the Sage**.\n\n**Subtle and profound**, **penetrating the Mysterious**,\n**deep beyond recognition**.\n**Annotation:** The **virtue and power of the Dao** are **profound and distant**,\nunable to be **known or discerned**—\n**inner vision is blind**, **reversed hearing is deaf**,\nnone know **its extent**.\n**Master Gu** says: **\"For\"** means **\"affairs\"**;\nspeaking of those in ancient times who **excelled in taking the Dao as their affairs**,\n**even in slight and subtle words**,\nthe **profound and refined Dao** is **unfailingly discerned and illuminated**,\nyet its **virtue and power are deep and vast**,\nbeyond recognition.\n**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **\"Subtle and profound\"** is **the wisdom that enables cultivation**,\n**\"penetrating the Mysterious\"** is **the realm of what is cultivated**—\nwhen **wisdom and realm converge**,\nboth **become profound**,\nand **cannot be known by the mind alone**—\nhence the admiration.\n\nFor **only what cannot be recognized** is **worthy of being described**.\n**Annotation:** Referring to the following sentence;\n**Master Gu** says: **Only the virtue and power of the Dao are difficult to recognize**,\nhence **forcefully describing its appearance** to make it clear.\n**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **\"Appearance\"** means **form and

formless principle** as **the appearance of cultivation**.\n\n**Cautious as winter crossing a river**,\n**Annotation:** When undertaking any matter, one must **add weight and caution**—\n**cautious as winter crossing a river**,\nfor the **heart finds it difficult**.\n**The *Xiang Er*** says: **\"Cautious\"** is **like hesitation**,\n**the bearing of movement and stillness**—\n**always should one stand in awe**.\nWinter crossing a river is **fearful**;\n**to fear the four neighbors**,\n**daring not to act wrongly**,\n**for fear they know**—\nthis is how **those who follow the Dao and honor its precepts** **show humility**.\n\n**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **\"Hesitation\"** is **fear**;\nspeaking of **those cultivating the Dao**,\n**fearing the world’s conditions**,\nlike **crossing a river in winter’s ice**,\n**the heart trembles in dread**,\n**fearing to sink**—\nthis **illustrates the purity of intent and deeds**.\n\n**Like fearing the four neighbors**,\n**Annotation:** Their **advance and retreat are hesitant and constrained**,\nas if **one commits a crime**,\n**fearing the four neighbors know**—\nthis **illustrates the purity of speech**.\n**Master Gu** says: The **four neighbors** are **birth, death, old age, and sickness**,\nalso **the four demons**—\nwhen one **does not uphold precepts**,\n**delights in violating the law**,\nthe **four demons record it**,\nhence one **must be cautious**,\n**as if fearing others’ knowledge**—\n**still and quiet**.\n\n**Solemn as a guest**,\n**Annotation:** Like a **guest facing the host**,\n**solemn and without contrivance**.\n\n「○Exegesis: *Yǎn* is the appearance of **dignity and solemnity**.\nThe *Records of Ritual* states: **\"Solemn as though in contemplation\"**, meaning the **sage** should **restrain and invigorate** the body and mind,\n**not indulging in laxity**,\nas if a **guest facing the host**,\n**unable to be frivolous**—\nthis **illustrates the purity of bodily conduct**.\n\n○Master Gù says: It is the **appearance of reverence and restraint**,\nspeaking of the **sage’s reverence and restraint**,\n**doing nothing artificial**,\nlike a **guest before the host**,\n**not daring to be

*Dūn* means **genuine and thick**,\n*Pǔ* means **formless and unadorned**—\n**internally preserving spirit**,\n**externally without ornament**.\n\n○Exegesis: *Dūn* is **sincerity and depth**,\n*Pǔ* is

tranquil**,\n**leisurely and clear**.\n**Though in motion, it remains still**—\nthis **illustrates stillness amid activity**.\n\n○Master Gù says: *Zhuó* is the **appearance of dullness**,\nmeaning

**responding to things in motion**,\n**the heart remains ever leisurely and transforming**—\nthis **illustrates stillness amid activity**.\n\n○Master Wáng says: **When waves are mixed, turbidity arises**,\n**when stillness is gradual, clarity emerges**,\n**when agitation is extreme, death follows**,\n**when tranquility is enduring, life sustains**.\n**The wise know turbidity can be cleared**,\nso **they harmonize with the waves** and then **transform**,\n**they grasp danger’s potential for safety**,\nso **they move gradually** to **nurture life**—\n**none but those who embody the Dao’s good transformation** can thus be.\nThus it is said **\"Who can?\"**.\n**Life and transformation are subtle and profound**,\n**not achieved quickly**,\nrequiring **the heart’s singular

they are close to him and praise him;\n○Commentary: **His virtue is visible**, his benevolence and favors can be spoken of,\nthus they are close and praise him.\n○Exalted Explication: **When virtue is pure yet declining**,\nthe Sovereign governs with good teachings,\nhis kindness is seen, hence they are close to him,\nhis achievements are high, hence they praise him.\n○Commentary: **Those of moderate insight**,\nwith somewhat dull faculties,\ncannot forget words to attain principles,\nmust cling to forms and study methodically,\nthus they immerse themselves in scriptures and teachings,\ncling to what is close and praise what is apparent,\ngenerating interpretations from texts and shared conventions.\n○Reflection: **This is the age of antiquity’s middle phase**,\ngrowing distant from the Dao,\nfixating on words and clinging to forms—\nits virtue is still visible.\nWhen they are close and praise above,\nthen below they trust and believe in him,\nbelow then praises and honors him above—\nhis deeds can be spoken of,\nthus songs of joy resound on the roads.\n\n**The next level**, they fear him;\n○Commentary: **He establishes forms and laws to govern them**.\n○Exalted Explication: **When virtue further declines**,\nthe Sovereign rules with many flaws,\nthe people cannot bear his commands,\nthus he drives them with punishments and retribution,\nhence they fear him.\n○Reflection: **Those of dull faculties**,\nwith hearts deceived by illusions,\ncannot discern clearly,\nthus they mock and slander.\n○Commentary: **Mockery**—**deception**.\nThose of low faculties,\nwith dull and coarse natures,\nindulge their hearts in chasing sensory objects,\ntheir entanglements deepen daily.\nThey only fear worldly authority and punishments,\nnot the underworld’s scrutiny and judgment,\nthus they mock and slander the sacred words,\ndestroying faith and disbelief—\nhence the scripture says: *‘The lower hear the Dao and laugh at it.’*\n\nWhen trust is insufficient,\n○Commentary: **The Sovereign’s trust is insufficient toward the lower**,\nthe lower then has deceitful and cunning people.\n○Exalted Explication: **The Sovereign’s trust is insufficient toward the lower**,\nthe lower then responds with disbelief,\nand deceives their Sovereign.\n○Reflection: **Those who fear and mock him**,\nall stem from the Sovereign’s insufficient trust,\nthus the lower has people who do not believe.\n\n○Commentary: **It is because their faculties are low and their obstacles heavy**,\ntheir trust in the Dao is insufficient,\nthus they doubt and slander the sacred texts,\nincurring the crime of disbelief.\n\n**Yet they still value words**,\n○Commentary: **Speaking of the Supreme Sovereign’s governance**,\nhis actions are still held in higher regard than words,\nfearing he may stray from the Dao and lose naturalness**.\n\n○Commentary: **They still value worldly, superficial, and false words**,\nthus they do not believe in the Dao’s true and authentic teachings,\nhence their confusion deepens daily,\nand their crimes and obstacles grow ever greater.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\n○Commentary: **This means the world is at great peace**.\nThe people say *‘it is natural for me.’*\n○Exalted Explication: **When deeds are done yet not grasped**,\naffairs fulfilled yet without action,\nthe people use them daily without knowing,\nsaying *‘it is natural that I have accomplished and fulfilled them.’*\n\n○Commentary: **When the functions of punishment and relief are fulfilled**,\nthe nurturing of life and affairs is complete,\nyet the supreme virtue subtly permeates,\nsuccess not claimed—\nthe people use them daily without knowing,\nall say *‘it is natural that I have attained such things,’*\nunaware of the sacred grace bestowed.\n\n○Reflection: **Transformation does not come through words**,\nthe silent merit subtly covers all,\neach thing roams freely,\nbeating earthenware in self-awakened joy,\nusing them daily without knowing,\nrejoicing in reliance without master,\nunaware of who has wrought this—\nthus they all say *‘it is natural for me.’*\n\nWhen the **Great Dao is abandoned**,\n**there arises benevolence and righteousness**.\n○Commentary: **In the age of the Great Dao**,\neach family has filial children,\neach household has loyal and trustworthy people—\nbenevolence and righteousness are unseen.\nWhen the **Great Dao is abandoned and not practiced**,\nevil and rebellious deeds arise together,\nthen **benevolence and righteousness** can be transmitted as the **Dao**.\n\n○Exalted Explication: **When purity is diluted and simplicity dispersed**,\nthe **Great Dao does not prevail**,\ndaily **benevolence and righteousness** emerge,\nsmall achievements arise and are completed,\nyet **purity is diluted, simplicity dispersed**,\nelaborate flaws spring from deliberate action.\n\n○Commentary: **This is the abandonment of the ancient teachings**.\nSpeaking of the **Great Dao’s** age,\nthe five virtues are not manifest,\n**benevolence and righteousness** arise,\n**purity and simplicity** then decay—\nhence *Zhuangzi* says:\n*‘Dispersing virtue and the Dao to create benevolence and righteousness is the fault of the sages.’*\nAnd again:\n*‘They rely on one another to moisten, they support one another with oil—\nit is not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes.’*\n\nWhen wisdom emerges,\n**there arises great falsehood**.\n○Commentary: **The wise Sovereign**,\ndevalues virtue while valuing words,\ndevalues substance while valuing ornament—\nthe lower then responds by creating **great falsehood and deceit**.\n\n○Exalted Explication: **Using wisdom**,\nhe will establish laws.\nWhen laws emerge, deceit arises,\nthus there is **great falsehood**.\n\n○Commentary: **Wisdom**—**sacred wisdom**.\nThe upper uses **sacred wisdom** to govern things,\nlaws and decrees multiply,\nthe lower then employs countless deceits to evade the net of punishments,\nstealing **sacred wisdom** to fashion false instruments—\nthe harm of wisdom is fully shown in *Zhuangzi’s* texts.\n\n○Reflection: **In the age of the Great Dao**,\nthere is no knowledge, no desire,\nall things cherish virtue,\nexternal use unseen—\nwhen the Dao’s merit ceases,\ndeceit then flourishes.\nWielding wisdom startles the dull,\ndisplaying talent moves the common,\n**purity disperses, simplicity departs**,\ndeceitful emotions arise together—\nthus it is said: **great falsehood**.\n\n「When the six bonds of kinship are fractured,\n**filial piety and benevolence** arise.\n**Explication:** The six bonds of kinship severed,\nthen relatives and kin fall out of harmony,\nand thus **filial piety and benevolence** emerge to nurture one another.\n\n○**御 (Yu) says:** All stem from losing the Dao,\nso there are **partial names** in its place.\n\n○**疏 (Shu) says:** The six bonds of kinship—\nfather and son, brothers, husband and wife.\nIn a world of **purity and harmony**,\npartial affection is not evident.\nWhen the six bonds fall into disorder,\n**filial piety and benevolence** then stand out,\nhence in the age when Zhou’s **virtue/power** declined,\n**Jiao (浇, King Jie of Xia)** arose in competition,\nand **Zeng Min (曾闵, Zeng and Min)** were praised for their lofty conduct.\n\nWhen a state is in chaos,\n**loyal ministers** appear.\n**Explication:** When laws and decrees fail,\nsuperior and inferior blame each other,\nevil factions vie for power,\nand thus **loyal ministers** arise to rectify their ruler.\n\nThis is to say:\nIn the age of the **Great Dao**,\nthere is no knowledge of **ren (仁)** and **yi (义)**—\npeople are naturally without desire for propriety,\nyet they remain inherently clean;\nno need for **zheng (贞, integrity)**,\nyet they are naturally upright;\nno need for **zhong (忠, loyalty)**,\nyet they keep their word.\n\nIn the **Great Dao’s** time,\n**ren (仁)** and **yi (义)** vanish,\n**filial piety and benevolence** fade away—\njust as at noon, when the sun is brightest,\nall stars lose their luster.\n\n○**疏 (Shu) says:** The sovereign of myriad chariots,\nholding the four seas as his home,\nthus when a state is only well-governed,\nloyalty and sincerity remain unseen.\nIn times of chaos,\n**upright integrity** then shines forth—\nhence **Long Feng (龙逢)** was renowned for his loyalty under **King Jie of Xia (夏桀)**,\nand **Bi Gan (比干)** was praised for his virtue under **King Zhou of Shang (殷纣)**.\n\n**Discarding sacred wisdom**,\n**Explication:** Discarding the **sacred wisdom** of rulers,\nreturning to the original, guarding the root—\nthe Five Emperors (五帝) drew symbols,\n**Cang Jie (仓颉)** created writing,\nyet this was not as good as the Three Sovereigns (三皇) using knotted cords without script.\n\n**Abandoning cleverness**,\n**Explication:** Abandoning **cleverness**,\nreturning to **non-action (无为)**.\nThe people’s benefits multiply a hundredfold;\n**Explication:** Agriculture prospers,\npublic affairs are without private gain.\n\n○**御 (Yu) says:** Discarding the **sacred wisdom** of rulers,\nthen their teachings fade away,\nand **transformation (化)** is smooth without contrivance.\nAbandoning the **common folk’s** cunning and deceitful schemes,\npeople return to **purity and simplicity**.\nWhen people return to **purity and simplicity**,\nartifice does not arise,\n**self-aggrandizement and partiality** cease.\nPeople in harmony with **Heaven’s Dao**,\nthings lose no part of their nature—\nthus there is **a hundredfold increase in benefits**.\n\n○**疏 (Shu) says:** Discarding the **sacred wisdom** of named sages,\nabandoning discriminating cleverness,\npeople all return to their roots,\ntheir benefits become boundless—\n*a hundredfold* is but an approximation of the great number.\nHence *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Rui’s wine was thin, yet Han Dan (邯郸) was besieged—\nwhen sages arise, great thieves appear.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Tian Chengzi (田成子) stole a kingdom using sacred wisdom.\"*\n\n**Discarding ren and abandoning yi**,\n**Explication:** Discarding **ren (仁)**’s display of favor,\nabandoning **yi (义)**’s emphasis on empty words—\nthe people return to **filial piety and benevolence**;\n**Explication:** **Virtue/power**’s transformation is pure.\n\n○**御 (Yu) says:** Discarding **ren (仁)** as universal love,\nabandoning **yi (义)**’s rejection of material gain,\nthen people return to **great filial piety and benevolence**.\n\n○**疏 (Shu) says:** Discarding **ren (仁)**’s partial inclinations,\nabandoning **yi (义)**’s rigid adherence to forms,\npeople all follow their true nature,\nwithout artificiality or pretension.\n**Filial piety** springs from **Heaven’s natural order**,\n**benevolence** flows from spontaneous virtue—\nreturning to **purity and simplicity of antiquity**,\nhence it is said the people **return to their original state**.\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Ren and yi are the decayed huts and straw dogs of former kings.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"If you eliminate Zeng and Shi’s (曾史) conduct,\nthe world will all be ren.\"*\n\n**Discarding cleverness and abandoning profit**,\n**Explication:** Discarding clever deceit,\nsealing the path of greed,\nclosing the door to power struggles—\nthieves and robbers will not exist;\n**Explication:** When the upper echelons are fair and just,\nthe lower levels have no private or evil schemes.\n\n○**御 (Yu) says:** If one **boasts of partial skill**,\nthere will inevitably be **contention for profit**,\nthus discarding cleverness means people no longer contend,\nabandoning profit means people find self-sufficiency.\nWhen self-sufficient, they will not become thieves.\n\n○**疏 (Shu) says:** Discarding **cleverness** from divergent paths,\nabandoning **profit-seeking**,\neach thing guards its proper measure—\nthus there is no theft or robbery.\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"If a carpenter spits on his fingers,\nthe world will all be clever.\"*\n\nThese three cases,\n**Explication:** Referring to the three matters above\nthat should be discarded.\n\nThe text is insufficient in its teachings.\n**Explication:** It is insufficient because the teachings cannot guide the people.\n\n○**Shu says:** These three matters refer to the three prior absolutions. This text is a sudden teaching of the Great Vehicle, the study of the superior ones, whose principles are profound and distant, insufficient to instruct those of lower capacity. Therefore, it is ordered to have its proper associations.\n\n**Explication:** As in the following sentence.\n\n○**Yu says:** These three matters merely require abandonment; they do not yet demonstrate practice. Thus, it is said that this text is insufficient for instruction, and further associations are ordered—referring to the following passages.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Association* means to entrust. The people of lower capacity cannot yet bear the Great Vehicle’s teachings, so they must first have associations to arouse their learning. The associated text is the four lines below:\n\nSeeing simplicity, embracing sincerity,\n**Explication:** *Seeing simplicity* means to see and guard simplicity, not to adorn with artifice.\n\n*Embracing sincerity* means to embrace one’s natural simplicity and demonstrate it to the world, so it may be emulated.\n\nFew in private,\n**Explication:** To be upright and without self-interest.\n\nFew in desires,\n**Explication:** To know contentment.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Seeing simplicity*—rejecting ornamentation. *Embracing sincerity*—returning to reality. *Few in private*—uprightness and justice. *Few in desires*—quelling greed.\n\nAbandoning learning,\n**Explication:** Abandoning learning that is not true or does not conform to the Dao’s teachings.\n\nWithout worry.\n**Explication:** Removing superficiality, then there is no worry or trouble.\n\n○**Jie Jie says:** This means abandoning all scriptures and returning to the One.\n\n○**Yu says:** Abandoning the learning of contrivance, then one becomes pure and simple.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Worry*—trouble. Abandoning the learning of relative forms, one attains the principle of non-action, and thus troubles are exhausted, so there is no worry.\n\nHow far apart are *yes* and *ah*?\n**Explication:** Both are responses, yet how far apart they are—criticizing the times for valuing superficiality and demeaning substance.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Yes*—respectful assent. *Ah*—a lazy response. The *Records of Rites* says: When the teacher summons, do not answer. *How far apart*—not distant, but people do not understand the distinction between compliance and defiance, recklessly generating joy or anger. Hearing *yes* brings joy; hearing *ah* brings disdain, unaware that *yes* and *ah* issue from the same mouth, not far apart.\n\nHow far apart are good and evil?\n**Explication:** *Good* is praise, *evil* is slander—how different are they? The times detest the loyal and upright, favoring deceitful flatterers.\n\n○**Shu says:** Conforming to desire is good; opposing the heart is evil. Since compliance and defiance are both empty, beauty and ugliness are meaningless. Moreover, *yes* and *ah* arise from one mouth, while good and evil stem from one heart. Those who forget know they are not distinct; those who cling are divided like the liver and gall. Yet those entangled in contrivance are many, and within the distinctions of right and wrong, within the *yes* and *ah*, lies the root of all troubles. To abandon them is to have no worry—these two pairs briefly illustrate what must be abandoned in the learning of attachment.\n\nWhat people fear,\n**Explication:** *People*—the Daoist practitioner. What they fear is fearing not to abandon learning in rulers.\n\nCannot but fear.\n**Explication:** Nearby are those who kill the virtuous through flattery.\n\n○**Shu says:** This is what the practitioner fears—life and death, and all worldly entanglements.\n\n**Explication:** They will surely perish. Earlier, it was ordered to abandon evil, showing that beauty and ugliness are both empty, lest one become attached to this text and be stained by worldly affairs. Hence, this sentence is issued as a warning.\n\nHow vast and endless it is!\n**Explication:** The people of the world are chaotic and unrestrained, desiring to study but clinging to false teachings, with no end.\n\n○**Shu says:** The *River Above* text reads *vast*, while others say *wild and boundless*—a distant, dim vastness. *Endless*—lamenting that it does not cease. The hearts of sentient beings are deeply entangled for a long time, their attachments firm, with no time of rest.\n\nAll people are exultant,\n**Explication:** *Exultant*—indulgent in lust and desire.\n\nLike feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\n**Explication:** Like a starving man craving the finest sacrificial meats, never satisfied.\n\nLike ascending a terrace in spring.\n**Explication:** In spring, yin and yang interact, and all things respond. Ascending a terrace to gaze upon it, one’s desires are unrestrained.\n\n○**Shu says:** Many are entangled, hence *all people*—another term for *sentient beings*. *Exultant*—joy and delight. *Feasting*—banqueting. *Grandest sacrifice*—ox, sheep, and pig. Sentient beings delight in sounds and colors, their attachments extreme, like a starving man feasting on the finest sacrificial meats, finding such joy, or like ascending a terrace in spring, gazing upon forests and fields, finding their hearts fully at ease.\n\nI alone am serene, with no signs yet.\n**Explication:** I alone am serene and tranquil, with no traces of desire.\n\n○**Shu says:** *I*—the Old Master’s self-reference. *Serene*—stillness. *Signs*—manifestation. The Sage, though in the world, has a still and serene mind, untouched by the surroundings, with no inclination toward green hills.\n\nLike an infant before it smiles.\n**Explication:** Like a child before it can laugh at others.\n\n○**Yu says:** I alone am serene and tranquil, with no traces of desire, like that infant before it can laugh.\n\nTowering yet without destination.\n**Explication:** Towering like a remote village, with nowhere to go.\n\n○**Yu says:** The Perfect One has no mind; movement follows things, taking and giving nothing. Like a traveler with no destination.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Infant*—the uncarved block. *Smile*—laughter. *Towering*—vastness. *Destination*—movement. The Sage acts without deviating from stillness, remains untouched in defilement, like that infant before it can laugh, its form and mind both still. Its wisdom is vast and respectful, its capacity boundless—like an empty boat with no mooring.\n\nAll people have excess,\n**Explication:** People have excess wealth for luxury, excess intelligence for deceit.\n\nI alone seem abandoned—\n**Explication:** I alone appear cast aside, as if insufficient.\n\n○**Shu:** The multitude clings to possession, thus indulging in excess. The Sage’s wisdom embodies emptiness, thus abandoned and untaken.\n\nI hold the heart of the simple fool—\n**Explication:** I do not follow the ways of the world, steadfast in the One, unmoved, like the heart of the simple fool.\n\nPure and undivided—\n**Explication:** Without distinction.\n\n○**Shu:** Pure and undivided—unmixed. The Sage’s wisdom is empty and clear, pure and refined, like the simple fool’s heart, undivided.\n\nThe vulgar shine brightly—\n**Explication:** Bright and discerning.\n\nI alone seem dim—\n**Explication:** As if obscured.\n\n○**Yu:** I conceal myself.\n○**Shu:** The vulgar’s hearts are dim yet sharp in distinction, boasting their cleverness. The Sage’s wisdom is empty yet luminous, bright as sun and moon, yet veiled—thus seeming dim.\n\nThe vulgar are keen and hasty—\n\nThe vulgar are keen and hasty—\n**Explication:** They are quick and sharp in discernment.\n\n○**Yu:** Establishing laws and institutions.\n\nI alone am **mènmèn**—\n**Explication:** Without cutting off or restricting.\n\n○**Shu:** Keen and hasty, this is the heart of distinction. **Mènmèn** is broad and unhurried, the wisdom of undivided discernment. Though the vulgar’s hearts are dull in perception, they cling to judging right and wrong, recklessly hastening in urgency. The Sage’s wisdom perceives form yet transcends it, knows emptiness and illusion, ever abiding in stillness.\n\nLike the vast sea—\n**Explication:** I alone drift and flow like the river and sea, boundless in extent.\n\n○**Shu:** The *Héshàng* [River Above] text reads *hǎi* [sea]. **Huì** means dark, **zhǐ** means to stop or dwell. Though the Sage’s wisdom is truly luminous, it drifts like darkness seeking to reveal itself—bright yet not dazzling. Thus, this saying emerges.\n\nThough mingling with the dust of the world,\nYet ever serene and still—\nAnd not fixed in this stillness—\nThus, no true dwelling or halting.\n\nLike drifting without end—\n**Explication:** I alone drift and drift, as if rising and unbound, my spirit and intention soaring in the realm of the divine.\n\n○**Yu:** My heart is still, severed from worldly learning, as if without attachment or fixation.\n\nAll others have **yǐ**—\n**Explication:** *Yǐ*, worldly striving.\n\nI alone am dull, like the vulgar—\n**Explication:** I alone have no striving, seeming vulgar and lacking.\n\n○**Yu:** **Wán** means undivided; **bǐ** means insufficient, yet my heart truly comprehends. Though appearing insufficient, thus I say *like the vulgar*.\n\n○**Shu:** The vulgar are mired in sensory desires, never resting. Though they may take different paths, they all share the same worldly attachments. The Sage’s wisdom penetrates the false and the real, never distinguishing. Neither seeing what is right nor knowing what is wrong, like the dull and vulgar, yet in truth, it is thus.\n\nI alone differ from others—\n**Explication:** I alone am distinct from people.\n\n○**Yu:** Others are bound by emotions and desires; I have no tainted heart.\n\nAnd I alone honor **shímǔ**—\n**Explication:** *Shí*, to employ; *mǔ*, the Dao/Way.\n\nI alone hold the Dao/Way in highest regard.\n\n○**Shu:** Others distinguish and cling to sensory pleasures; I alone drift in forgetfulness. Distinction leads to attachment to sounds and colors; forgetfulness leads to reverence for the true Dao/Way—thus my difference.\n\nThe **vast virtue’s** appearance—\n**Explication:** *Kong*, great/extreme; the bearing of one with great virtue.\n\nOne with great virtue encompasses all without exception,\n**Explication:** able to receive filth and turbidity, to dwell in humility.\nOnly the Dao/Way is followed.\n\n**Explication:** *Wei*, alone; one with great virtue does not conform to worldly practices but follows the Dao/Way alone.\n\n○**Shu:** The great/extreme virtue’s bearing—how does it appear?\nOnly in following the Dao/Way does its form manifest.\n**Alternative:** *Róng*, to encompass; great virtue’s profound harmony\nthus moves the heart and shapes conduct, following the Dao/Way alone.\nIn speech and silence, actions and reticence, all are Dao/Way’s domains.\n\nThe Dao/Way, as a thing—\n**Explication:** The Dao/Way’s relation to all things:\nIt alone comes and goes in their midst.\n\n○**Yu:** This reveals the Dao/Way that the great virtue follows—\nneither having nor lacking, beyond naming or verification,\nhence it is *hunhuáng*.\n\n○**Shu:** Of the supreme Dao/Way as a thing,\nIt neither has nor lacks, yet though it has, it lacks;\nthough it lacks, it does not lack.\nIts presence and absence are indeterminate,\nthus it is *huánghū*.\n\nWhy speak of \"thing\"?\nTo clarify the Dao/Way does not depart from things,\nthings do not depart from the Dao/Way;\noutside the Dao/Way, there are no things,\noutside things, there is no Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way and things are one in function,\none in essence—\nalso, enlightenment is the unity of things and Dao/Way,\ndelusion is their duality.\nThings and Dao/Way are neither one nor two,\nyet one while not one—\nnot Dao/Way, not things,\nyet Dao/Way and things are not two.\nHence, one is not one,\nand things are not dual.\n\n○**Gù:** It seeks to define presence,\nyet has no color, no sound;\nto say it lacks presence,\nyet it has emotion, has faith—\nfor its essence cannot be defined,\nthus it is *hunhuáng*.\n\nWithin *hunhuáng* there is form,\n**Explication:** Though the Dao/Way is *hunhuáng* and shapeless,\nit alone sets patterns for all things.\n\n○**Yu:** *Hū*, lacking; *huáng*, having.\nIts traces appear as daily forms.\nFrom the void descending into manifestation,\nit becomes the form of all things.\n\nWithin *hunhuáng* there is substance,\n**Explication:** Though the Dao/Way is *hunhuáng*,\nwithin it there is unity—\nnurturing and transforming, establishing form through *qi*.\n\n○**Shu:** Within it is substance—\nthis is the divine mystery,\nthe wondrous thing named.\nThough neither lacking nor having,\nit contains an unfathomable substance.\nWithin it is form—\nthis is *qi*, though neither form nor color,\nit becomes form and color,\nthus it is *qi*.\nSpeaking of the Dao/Way’s manifold transformations,\nit is neither lacking nor having in things,\nneither lacking nor having in form.\n\nWithin *yǎomiǎng* there is essence.\n**Explication:** Though the Dao/Way is *yǎomiǎng* and formless,\nwithin it there is essence—\nthe subtle interplay of yin and yang\nto establish form and spirit.\n\n○**Jiě:** Refers to the original *qi* in the brain transforming into essence.\n\n○**Yu:** *Hū* and *huáng* are presence and absence,\n*yǎomiǎng* is unfathomable.\nIn generation and transformation,\nthe essence is wondrously preserved.\n\n○**Shu:** *Yǎomiǎng*, profound and distant.\nWithin it is essence—*wisdom*.\nThe Dao/Way, though profound and distant, *hū* and *huáng*,\npossesses wondrous essence and spirit—\nits wisdom shines without bounds,\nits divine power unfathomable.\n\nIts essence is most true,\n**Explication:** The Dao/Way’s essence, *qi*, and spirit are wondrously true,\nwithout adornment.\n\n○**Shu:** Its true essence is unmixed,\nnot empty or false.\nAmong the three-in-one, it emphasizes essence\nto reveal essence as the root of *qi*, color, and spirit’s function.\n\n○**Gù:** The supreme Dao/Way’s essence and spirit are utterly true, without falsehood.\n\nWithin it there is faith.\n**Explication:** The Dao/Way hides its function, conceals its name,\nits faith resides within.\n\n○**Jiě:** Refers to *essence*.\nIf essence does not transform and blood does not store,\nthen one becomes a true person.\nIn one’s conduct, within it there is faith.\n\n○**Shu:** The Dao/Way has no mind,\nyet responds to stimuli without fail—\nfaith like the four seasons,\nnever out of step.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name does not depart,\n**Explication:** *Zì*, from; from ancient times to the present,\nthe Dao/Way remains ever-present.\n\n○**Jiě:** *Name* refers to the Dao/Way;\nthe Sage does not die, his name endures.\n\n○**Shu:** Time has ancient and present,\nyet the Dao/Way has neither coming nor going.\nSince its name does not depart,\nit suffices to show it has no coming—\nthe text is concise.\n\nWith this, it observes all things at their beginning.\n**Explication:** *Yuè*, to receive/embody; *fǔ*, initial.\nThe Dao/Way can embody and bestow,\nall things begin to arise—\nthey receive *qi* from the Dao/Way.\n\n○**Shu:** *Yuè*, to survey; *fǔ*, initial.\nThough the supreme Dao/Way has neither coming nor going,\nit also goes and comes—\nthus it surveys ancient and present,\nresponds to all ends and beginnings.\n\nHow do I know all things arise thus?\n**Explication:** How do I know all things receive *qi* from the Dao/Way?\n\nWith this.\n**Explication:** *This*, the present;\nwith the present, all things gain the Dao/Way’s essence and *qi* to arise.\nHuman actions, movements, and dwellings\nwithout the Dao/Way would not be.\n\n○**Shu:** A rhetorical question posed.\nLaozi asks: How do I know the affairs of beginning and end?\nOnly through this pure and faithful Dao/Way,\nthe joyous and *hū* *yǎomiǎng* method,\ndo I know it.\n\nBending brings fullness,\n**Explication:** *Qū*, to bend oneself to others;\nnot asserting oneself brings fullness.\n\n○**Shu:** Flexible and compliant,\nnot clinging to things’ emotions—\ngentle and weak, humble and harmonious,\npreserving life’s Dao/Way,\nthus *Zhuangzi* says:\nI walk in curves, yet my feet remain unharmed,\nthis sentence forgets compliance.\n\nPerverting brings rectitude,\n**Explication:** *Yǎng*, to bend oneself while extending to others;\nlong-term, one attains rectitude.\n\n○**Shu:** *Yǎng*, to err/transgress.\nKnowing transgression and error are not dual,\none can receive slander without retaliating—\nthus, perversion gains true rectitude.\nThis sentence forgets praise and blame.\n\nHollow brings abundance,\n**Explication:** *Dì*, earth; hollow and low,\nwater flows into it—\nhumble and low, virtue returns to it.\n\nWorn brings renewal,\n**Explication:** *Bì*, to receive harm/thinness;\nself-sacrifice for others, the world respects it—\nlong-term, one attains renewal.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Dì*, to be low/humble.\nHumble and yielding, retiring oneself to lowliness,\nnot competing with others—\nthus virtue and conduct overflow abundantly.\nThis sentence forgets the high and the low.\n\n**Explication:** *Bì*, to be worn/harmed.\nTo endure dishonor and vileness while not coveting glory and favor,\none’s virtue renews daily—\nthis again forgets honor and disgrace.\n\n**Moderation brings gain,**\n**Explication:** *Shǎo*, to take little—then one gains much.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven favors the humble,\nthe divine illuminates the empty.\n**Excess brings confusion,**\n**Explication:** *Duō*, to be excessive.\nThe vulgar, with many thoughts and desires,\nwalk without steadfastness—\nthus they are confused.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Shǎo* refers to the complete practice of *Yǎng* (bending/extending),\nunaware of high and low,\ndwelling in the singular middle.\n\n*Duō* refers to being stuck in the duality of *Wéi Shùn* (compliance/transgression),\nnever leaving the two extremes.\n\nTo embody the singular middle—then gain is attained;\nto cling to the two extremes—then confusion arises.\n\nThus the sage holds the One as the model for all under Heaven.\n**Explication:** *Bào*, to guard/hold.\n*Shì*, law/pattern.\nThe sage guards the One and thus knows all things,\nmaking it the law/pattern for all under Heaven.\n\n○**Commentary:** It means to focus on the One Dao/Way,\nto guard the balance of the self.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Shì*, law/pattern.\nThe sage upholds this singular middle Dao/Way,\nguiding all beings by its path—\nthus becoming the exemplar for all under Heaven’s cultivation.\n\n**Not self-illuminating—then clarity,**\n**Explication:** The sage does not see the world as through his own eyes,\nbut uses the sight of all under Heaven to perceive it—\nthus attaining clarity.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Wù* (things) and *wǒ* (self) alike are empty,\nno perception of self or form—\nthus wisdom shines brightly.\n\n**Not self-righteous—then brilliance,**\n**Explication:** The sage does not assert his own correctness while rejecting others—\nthus his virtue/power shines in the world.\n\n○**Commentary:** Self and others are equal;\nnot asserting correctness in oneself or in things—\nthus his virtue/power is manifest and evident.\n\n**Not self-praising—then merit,**\n**Explication:** *Fá*, to take/claim.\nThe sage’s virtue/power flows naturally,\nnot claiming its own beauty—\nthus it benefits all under Heaven.\n\n○**Commentary:** Though he may be merciful to all beings,\nhe humbles himself as their dog (servant),\nattributing merit to others—\nthus he attains great merit.\n\n**Not self-glorifying—then longevity.**\n**Explication:** *Jīng*, to magnify/boast.\nThe sage does not exalt himself—\nthus his virtue/power endures without peril.\n\n○**Commentary:** Only by attributing merit to others,\nnot boasting or magnifying—\nthus his virtue/power lasts far and wide.\n\n**For only the non-competing—\nnone under Heaven can compete with them.**\n**Explication:** *Zhēng*, to contend.\nThis praises those of the four virtues,\nwho grasp compliance/transgression subtly,\ncultivate themselves with humility—\nand do not contend with others—\nthus all ranks under Heaven cannot contend with the non-competing.\n\n**The ancients’ saying—\"Flexibility brings wholeness\"—\nwas it idle speech?**\n\n**Explication:** *Qū*, to bend.\n*Zéng*, to follow.\nThe ancients said that bending and yielding in compliance\npreserves one’s Dao/Way—\nthis saying is true, not idle.\nOnly by following the teachings and practicing accordingly,\nnot contending with others—\none attains complete virtue/power,\nand all things return to oneself.\n\nThus, **wholeness is indeed attained and returned.**\n\n**Explication:** *Chéng*, reality/truth.\nThose who practice bending and yielding\ntruly preserve their body and mind,\nreturning to their parents (nature)—\nno harm comes to them.\n\n**Sparse speech is natural.**\n**Explication:** *Xī*, to love/minimize.\nThose who love minimizing speech\nembody the Dao/Way of Nature.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Xī*, few/sparse.\nIf one loves few words and sparse speech,\nthen actions align with Nature’s Dao/Way.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Xī*, to minimize.\nMinimizing speech is to forget speech.\nThe ultimate of Nature is the *Chóng Xuán* (profound emptiness).\nDao/Way seeks to clarify the ultimate,\nwhich transcends speech.\nSpeech itself deviates from principle—\nonly by forgetting speech and discarding teaching,\ncan one aptly meet the profound emptiness.\n\n**Gale winds do not last a morning,\ntorrent rains do not last a day.**\n\n**Explication:** *Piāo*, drifting.\n*Fēng*, wind.\n*Zòu*, sudden.\n*Yǔ*, rain.\nIt says that swiftness cannot endure,\nviolence cannot persist.\n\n○**Commentary:** Drifting winds and sudden rains\ndo not even last a morning—\nhow could they endure a full day?\nIt likens those who cling to teaching, lost in doctrine,\nto rash actions in pursuit of swift rewards—\ntheir resolve is fleeting and cannot last long,\nhence the comparison to gale winds and torrent rains.\n\nDay is the total of morning,\nmorning is a division of day—\nthe division illustrates the newness of each moment,\nthe total signifies the span of a hundred years,\nboth convey impermanence.\n\n○**Commentary:** Mountains and valleys communicate,\ngiving rise to gale winds.\nYin-qi erupts,\nforming torrent rains.\nWhen yin and yang lose their rhythms,\nthen gale winds and sudden rains occur.\nIf humans lose the middle harmony,\nthen they become violent and swift.\nRuining the body and losing substance—\nthis cannot be sustained.\nSudden violence is not constant,\nNature cannot endure it long—\nthus it is said: \"They do not last a morning.\"\n\n○**Commentary:** Heaven disperses yang-qi downward,\nwhich becomes wind;\nEarth ascends yin-qi upward,\nwhich condenses into rain.\n\n○**Commentary:** Heaven is vigorous, Earth is yielding,\nthe divine qi is uniquely absolute—\nthis causes sudden violence and swiftness,\nyet even this cannot last a full day,\nlet alone the vulgar, who are born in the morning and die in the evening,\nand whose many words harm others—\nhow could they endure?\n\n○**Commentary:** The greatest forms are Heaven and Earth.\nThe most expansive qi are yin and yang.\nWhen yin and yang clash,\nHeaven and Earth intertwine—\ngale winds and sudden rains arise,\nyet cannot last long.\nHow much more so for humans,\nso small and fragile between Heaven and Earth,\nwho perish swiftly from excessive speech—\ntheir swift extinction is known.\n\n**Who causes this?**\nHeaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth cannot endure long—\n*[Note: They cannot last from morning to evening.]*\nHow much more so for humans?\n*[Note: Heaven and Earth are supremely divine; when they combine to produce gale winds and sudden rains, they still cannot last from morning to evening. How much more so for humans, who seek sudden death?]*\n\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*\"Who\"*—this is a rhetorical question asking who causes the winds and rains.\nThe answer is: The Two Principles of Heaven and Earth generate and transform with great divine power.\nEven gale winds and sudden rains cannot endure long—\nhow much more so for the vulgar, whose reckless actions\ncannot last?\nThus, those who practice the Dao—\n*[Note: \"From\" here means \"to engage in.\" Humans should act in accordance with the Dao’s tranquility, not like gale winds and sudden rains.]*\n○ **Yu’s Commentary:**\nThose who practice the Dao should not cling to rigid teachings.\nThose who embody the Dao awaken to it and forget speech—\nthus, they align with the Dao itself.\n○ **Exegesis:**\n\"Following the Dao\" means yielding to it.\n\"Affairs\" refers to worldly matters.\nThose who embody supreme virtue act in accordance with both principle and reality,\nwith the Dao and with things—\nthus, they naturally remain empty and fluid,\njust as Confucius said: *\"Only the Dao is worth following.\"*\n\n○ **Cai’s Commentary:**\nIf all actions conform to the Dao,\nthen the Dao is attained—\nthis is the harmony of Dao’s operation.\n\n○ **Wang’s Commentary:**\nTo reverse conventional teachings and conform to the Dao,\none must abandon all burdens and merge with emptiness—\nthis is called aligning with the Dao.\nThe Dao responds accordingly.\n\n*[Note: This is because one’s actions and understanding merge,\nallowing perception and wisdom to converge naturally.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\n\"Dao attained\" means attaining the Dao.\nThose who align with virtue also attain virtue.\n*[Note: \"Virtue\" here refers to those who cultivate virtue.\nThose who align with virtue act in accordance with it.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe Dao is the eternal principle;\nvirtue is the highest virtue.\nThose who embody both teaching and practice, forgetting speech,\nact in harmony with supreme virtue—\nthus, virtue naturally resonates and responds in kind.\nThe Dao is the essence of virtue;\nvirtue is the manifestation of the Dao.\nSpeaking of essence, we call it Dao;\nspeaking of manifestation, we call it virtue—\nhence the two expressions.\n\nThose who align with loss also lose.\n*[Note: \"Loss\" refers to acting selfishly and failing others.]*\nThose who align with loss also lose.\n*[Note: Those who act in accordance with loss also delight in loss.]*\nThose who align with the Dao also find the Dao delights in them.\n*[Note: Those who align with the Dao also find the Dao delights in them.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThose who act recklessly, cling to teachings, and remain deluded\nultimately align with those who act against principle—\nthus, they cannot attain empty-hearted unity.\nAs for those who claim to speak of the Dao yet fail—\nthis is akin to losing the Dao itself.\nThus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"In past lives, you did not study;\nnow you consort with those who stray.\"*\n\nThose who align with virtue also find virtue delights in them.\n*[Note: Those who align with virtue also find virtue delights in them.]*\nThose who align with loss also find loss delights in them.\n*[Note: Those who align with loss also find loss delights in them.]*\n\nLacking faith is met with disbelief.\n*[Note: If the ruler lacks faith in his subjects,\nthe subjects respond with disbelief.]*\nThere is disbelief.\n*[Note: This speaks of natural affinities:\ndragons gather where dragons are,\nwinds follow tigers,\nwater flows to moisture,\nfire seeks dryness—\nthese are the laws of nature.]*\n○ **Yu’s Commentary:**\nClinging to speech and rigid teachings,\none fails to awaken—\nthis is the root of insufficient faith.\nAligning with loss, loss seeks them—\nthis is the manifestation of disbelief.\n○ **Exegesis:**\nUnable to forget speech and instead seeking principle through words,\nthough one claims to have faith in the Dao,\none’s understanding remains insufficient.\nThus, clinging to speech and rigid teachings,\none fails to grasp the true source—\nhence, in the realm of the Triple Mystery,\none harbors doubt.\n\nThose who advance arrogantly cannot stand.\n*[Note: \"Advance\" here means greedy for power and fame,\nseeking glory and honor—\nsuch actions cannot sustain one’s conduct or the Dao.]*\nThose who strut cannot walk.\n*[Note: Those who consider themselves noble and domineer over others\nare despised by the crowd,\npreventing them from proceeding.]*\nThose who self-display are blind.\n*[Note: People who admire their own appearance or actions,\nbelieving them virtuous,\nare unaware of their ugliness or vulgarity.]*\n○ **Yu’s Commentary:**\nFlashing talent and boasting of oneself\nonly invites criticism—\nthus, one remains unseen.\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThis is because one cannot forget the self.\n\nThose who insist on being right are not illuminated.\n*[Note: Those who insist on their own correctness while rejecting others\nare despised by the crowd,\npreventing their virtue from shining.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe crowd despises them—\nthus, their virtue remains hidden.\n\nThose who boast of their own merits achieve nothing.\n*[Note: Those who constantly praise their own achievements\nlose the true credit of having helped others.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nWhenever they act, they immediately claim credit,\nand others refuse to acknowledge their contributions—\nthus, they achieve no true merit.\n\nThose who pride themselves cannot endure.\n*[Note: Those who boast of their own greatness\ncannot last long.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nArrogance and vanity, contempt for others—\nthis is short-sightedness.\nHow could such virtue endure?\n\nSuch people bring only excess consumption and superfluous actions to the Dao.\n*[Note: \"Excess\" here means greed.]*\nIf such boastful, self-praising individuals govern a state,\nthey daily extort surplus taxes and luxuries for their own gluttony.\n○ **Exegesis:**\n\"Excess consumption\" refers to leftover food—\n\"superfluous\" refers to useless flesh, as in *Zhuangzi*:\n*\"Hanging warts and parasitic growths.\"*\nSuch prideful, self-righteous people,\nin their Daoist practice,\nare like leftover food and parasitic growths—\nhow despicable they are.\n\nPeople may come to hate them.\n*[Note: Such individuals in power act harmfully,\nso all fear and despise them.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nSuperfluous flesh is useless;\nboastful actions are meaningless.\nThose who cultivate the Dao would never harbor such vain ambitions.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao do not dwell [in any one place].\n*[Note: Those who follow the Dao do not remain fixed in any realm or state.]*\n\nThere exists a primal unity that coalesced before Heaven and Earth came into being.\n*[Note: This refers to the Dao—formless and indistinct, yet giving rise to all things before Heaven and Earth existed.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe \"primal unity\" is the Dao.\nThe Dao is neither a thing nor not a thing,\nneither formless nor formed,\nyet it generates all existence—\nthus it is both indistinct and distinct.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The divine and the sovereign spirits,\ngiving birth to Heaven and Earth,\nyet not aging—*\n*Silent and boundless,\nself-sufficient and unchanging.\"*\n\nSilent and void,\nit stands alone without peer,\nunchanging in its transformations.\n*[Note: Silent—without sound; void—without form.\nAlone—without counterpart.\nUnchanging—its transformations are constant.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nSilent—no sound.\nVoid—no form.\nAlone—no dependence on another.\nUnchanging—no alteration or decay.\nThe Dao’s essence is profound and obscure,\nits form and sound extinguished,\nneither dependent nor altered—\nthis is the singularity beyond mere singularity.\n\nIts circulation is boundless and unceasing,\n*[Note: The Dao permeates Heaven and Earth without obstruction,\nneither scorching in the sun nor rotting in the shade,\npenetrating all things without peril or failure.]*\n○ **Exegesis (Node Analysis):**\nThe Sage embodies the Dao within the body,\nflowing through limbs, joints, orifices, and pores—\nthus its circulation is boundless and unceasing.\n\nIt can be the mother of all under Heaven.\n*[Note: The Dao nurtures all things,\nits vital essence like a mother to her children.]*\n○ **Exegesis (Node Analysis):**\nThe Sage who guards the Dao and embodies unity\nis the mother of all under Heaven.\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe Dao is everywhere—\nits circulation is boundless,\nits presence universal—\nthus there is no peril or failure.\nIt opens and harmonizes yin and yang,\nestablishes Heaven and Earth,\nnurtures all beings,\nand gives birth to all sentient life—\nthus it is the mother.\n\nI know not its name,\nso I call it the Dao.\n*[Note: I see no form to name the Dao,\nyet all things arise from it—\nthus I name it the Dao.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe Dao cannot be grasped by intellect;\nits name was first mentioned in the opening chapter:\n*\"The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\"*\nTaking its pervasive generative virtue,\nI name it the Dao.\n\nI forcefully name it **Great**.\n*[Note: Unable to name it truly,\nI call it Great—\nvast and without limit,\nencompassing all without exclusion.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nIts essence knows no bounds—\nthus it is called Great.\nNot *great* in the ordinary sense—\nthus it is called *Great* by force.\nNames summon the essence,\ncharacters express the virtue—\nthe Dao is its function,\nthe Great is its substance—\nthus it is named *Great* and called *Dao*.\nMen usually name first, then characterize,\nbut here the order is reversed\nto contrast the Dao with the common.\n\nThe Great is called **Passing**.\n*[Note: Its greatness is not like Heaven’s fixed position above\nnor Earth’s fixed position below—\nit moves on, without permanence.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*Passing*—to go.\nWith great power, it guides all beings\nto the Sage’s realm.\n\n*Passing* is called **Distant**.\n*[Note: Distant—extending to the boundless,\nits qi permeating Heaven and Earth without obstruction.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nAscending beyond the Three Realms,\nreaching the Three Purities.\n*Distant*—to return.\n*[Note: Return—restoration.]*\nHaving perfected the Dao within,\nattaining the distant Sage’s realm,\nit returns to the mortal world\nto compassionately save all beings.\n*Alternative Exegesis:*\nWhen lost, the Three Purities are the Three Realms;\nwhen enlightened, the Three Realms are the Three Purities—\nthus its return to the mundane is the Great Void Heaven above.\n\nThus, the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sovereign is Great.\n*[Note: The Dao is Great—encompassing Heaven and Earth without limit.\nHeaven is Great—covering all without exclusion.\nEarth is Great—bearing all without failure.\nThe Sovereign is Great—controlling all without overreach.\nWithin the realm, there are these four Great ones,\nand the Sovereign occupies one of them.]*\n○ **Exegesis (Command):**\nThe Sovereign is the master of humanity,\nthe fate of all things resting on his rise or fall.\nTo warn and admonish him,\nit is said the Sovereign occupies one of the four.\n○ **Exegesis:**\nWithin the domain, these four Great ones exist,\nand the Sovereign, with his transformative virtue,\nfollows Heaven and Earth in occupying one place.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Dao was never confined by boundaries—\nspeaking of ‘within the realm’ is to say\nthough confined, it is not confined,\nthough not confined, it is confined—\ndiscussing confinement,\nthough confined, it is not confined—\nencompassing all without limit.\"*\n\n○ **Exegesis (Node Analysis):**\nThe lungs are Great,\nthe heart is Great,\nthe liver is Great,\nthe spleen is Great—\nkidney water generates the One,\nand the Sovereign governs from the One,\nas the spleen’s qi spreads unity in all directions.\n\nThe Sovereign should model himself after Earth—\n*[Note: The ruler must emulate Earth’s stillness, gentleness, and yielding nature.]*\n\nThe cultivation of the five grains yields abundance,\nand digging yields sweet springs—\nlaboring without complaint,\nwith merit yet unclaimed.\n\nEarth follows Heaven,\n*[Heaven is serene and unmoving,\nbestowing without seeking return,\nnurturing all things yet taking nothing.]*\n\nHeaven follows the Dao,\n*[The Dao acts with effortless clarity,\nits subtle qi moving unseen,\nand all things form without contrivance.]*\n\nThe Dao follows *ziran* [自然].\n*[The Dao’s nature is spontaneous—\nit follows nothing, transcending all imitation.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis (Commentary):**\nThe ruler must emulate Earth—\ncalmness in action, for only then\ndoes wisdom arise.\nThus the next passage states:\n*\"Agitation loses sovereignty—\nwhen still as Earth,\nhe must next follow Heaven’s purity,\nnurturing all without partiality.\"*\n\nHeaven has the Three Lights—\na metaphor for wisdom’s illumination—\nEarth is the gate of *ding* [定, steadfastness],\nHeaven the gate of wisdom.\nHaving aligned with Heaven,\nhe must next follow the Dao’s boundless openness,\nembracing all things.\n\nHaving aligned with the Dao,\nhe must then follow *ziran*’s profound mystery—\nthe realm of *Chóngxuān* [重玄].\nThe Dao is the path,\n*ziran* is its essence—\nto grasp the essence is to master the path,\nhence the saying, *\"to follow.\"*\n\nFurther elucidation:\nThe Dao’s nature is *ziran*—\nit follows nothing,\ntranscending all cultivation,\nthus it is said, *\"the Dao follows ziran.\"*\n\n*Chóng* [重] is the root of *qīng* [轻]—\n*[For rulers, neglecting weightiness brings disrespect;\nin self-cultivation, neglect brings loss of vitality—\nflowers and leaves are light and fall,\nroots are heavy and endure.]*\n\n○ **Commentary:**\nThis warns against recklessness,\nfor it is written:\n*\"The noble does not act lightly, lest he lose authority.\"*\n\nStillness governs agitation—\n*[A ruler’s agitation brings ruin;\nin self-cultivation, agitation brings peril—\nthe dragon’s stillness allows transformation,\nthe tiger’s agitation invites early death.]*\n\n○ **Commentary:**\nStillness is non-action;\nagitation is desire—\ndesire brings death,\nnon-action brings longevity.\nStillness masters movement,\nthus it is the ruler’s essence.\n\nHence the sage moves through life\nyet never departs from *zhīzhòng* [辎重].\n*[Zhī: stillness. Zhòng: weightiness.]*\nThe sage walks the Dao all day,\nnever straying from stillness and weightiness.\n\n○ **Commentary:**\nThe noble and enlightened move through the world,\nyet remain rooted in weightiness and stillness—\nthis is motion in tranquility.\n\nThough adorned with palaces and halls,\ntheir repose is transcendent.\n*[Palaces: the royal halls.\nHalls: the consorts’ quarters.\nTranscendent: detached, uninvolved.]*\n\n○ **Commentary:**\nThose who embody weightiness and stillness,\nthough surrounded by splendor and comfort,\ndwell in emptiness and detachment,\nuntainted by worldly pleasures.\n\nHow then does the sovereign of ten thousand chariots—\n*[Naihe: a lament for the times, a sorrowful exclamation.\nTen thousand chariots: the king.]*\n—abandon the greatest treasure, the realm?\n*[The realm is the supreme position of authority.]*\nHow can the ruler indulge his body in excess,\nsquander his vital essence,\nand lose his

indulges in licentiousness and debauchery,\nimposes heavy taxes and unrest,\npursues sensual excess and ruinous desires,\nneglects his inner chambers—\nhis lament is profound,\nthus it is asked: *how is this possible?*\nAnd yet he treats his body with such levity,\nrisking the realm’s collapse.\n\n*[The ruler, though noble, must guard the One for longevity—\nseeing yet not learning,\nhe treats his

his ministers;\nself-neglect dissipates vital essence.]*\nagitation brings loss of sovereignty.\n*[The ruler’s haste undermines his authority;\nagitation depletes his spirit.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThose consumed by restless thought\ncannot attain longevity.\n\n○ **Commentary:**\nIndulgence and agitation grow worse by the day—\nexternally, the nation falls;\ninternally, the body perishes.\nLoyal ministers flee,\nthe throne collapses—\nloss of ministers,\nloss of sovereignty.\n\nThe virtuous path leaves no trace,\n*[The true practitioner seeks virtue within—\nno need to step outside,\nno need to leave the hall,\nthus no tracks remain.]*\n\n○ **Commentary:**\nTo act without action,\nto move without form—\nthis is the virtuous path,\na subtle accord with cultivation.\nWhen mind and wisdom merge,\nno traces appear—\nthis reveals a pure life.\n\nThe virtuous word has no flaws,\n*[The virtuous speaker chooses words with care,\nleaving no blemish or reproach in the world.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe enlightened teach without obstruction,\ntranscending literal forms,\nseeking meaning beyond symbols,\nforgetting speech in its essence—\nthus their words are without fault.\n\n○ **Commentary:**\nSpeech that is not spoken,\nspoken yet not spoken—\nall day speaking yet never speaking,\nnor ever not speaking—\nthis is the virtuous word.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"When words suffice, one speaks all day yet exhausts the Dao.\"*\n\nFlaws are defects,\nreproach is censure.\nSpeech and silence are one,\nthus no blame attaches to the mouth—\nthis reveals a pure tongue.\n\nThe virtuous plan requires no calculations,\n*[The virtuous strategist acts without scheming,\nneeding no abacus or reckoning.]*\n\n「The virtuous strategist who calculates through the Dao/Way\nholds fast to the One without deviation,\nthough myriad affairs arise,\nyet needs no abacus or reckoning—\nthe path is clear.\n\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe subtle insight of all dharmas as One in emptiness and illusion,\nabandoning neither emptiness nor illusion,\nthen the false body becomes true—\neffortless clarity,\nno need for scheming or calculation,\nthis reveals the purity of intent.\n\nThe virtuous closure knows no latch or bolt that can be opened,\n*[The virtuous who seals through the Dao/Way restrains emotions and desires,\nguarding the spirit—\nno door or barrier can be forced open,\nnor can it be unlocked.]*\n\n○ **Commentary:**\n*[The Dao/Way seals the mind,\nnot like a door with a latch or bolt that can be pried open.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThis refers to closing the breath and firming the spirit,\nsealing the celestial *yin* (天牝),\nretaining the earthly *yang* (地牡)—\nthus it is said, \"no latch or bolt.\"\n\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*[The virtuous transcend both speech and action,\nnot entering any false path—\nthe mind is free from entanglement in phenomena,\nphenomena bear no burden of arising thoughts,\nthough no latch or barrier exists,\nhow could it ever

rank\nprioritize others over themselves,\nharbor vast compassionate vows,\ntransform and guide all beings—\ntheir resolve is unyielding,\ntheir bonds unbroken,\nnot constrained by worldly ropes or cords,\nthus they cannot be undone.\n\nYet such vows are manifold,\nyet they reduce to five:\n1. The vow of awakening intent,\n   *[to enter my path and embrace the natural Dao/Way.]*\n2. The vow of subduing the mind,\n   *[to conquer all obstacles and delusions.]*\n3. The vow of knowing the true mind,\n   *[which bears nine grades,\n   yielding birth to the nine officials.]*\n4. The vow of emancipating the mind,\n   *[which bears three grades,\n   yielding birth to the Three Pure Ones—\n   the Sage, the True, and the Holy.]*\n5. The vow of the peerless mind,\n   *[to ascend directly to the Dao/Way’s fruit,\n   even attaining the Great Void.]*\n\nThe virtuous knotting binds these five minds\nwithout ever faltering—\nthis is the vow’s firm resolve.\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*[This refers to binding the soul and spirit,\nthe Sage holding fast to them—\nthus it is said, \"unbreakable.\"]*\n\nThe Sage ever holds the soul and spirit,\nthus it is said, \"unbreakable.\"\n\nTherefore, the Sage is always virtuous in saving beings,\n*[for the Sage’s constant teaching of loyalty and filial piety\nseeks to rescue the essence of human nature.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe Sage is one whose three actions are pure,\nwhose six senses are liberated.\nTo awaken vast vows,\nto rescue and guide all beings,\nthe Sage remains in the world,\nresponding to each need—\ncompassionate, equitable, and boundless,\nnever abandoning any.\n\nAnd yet, no being is abandoned;\n*[for the Sage guides the noble and lowly to their proper place.]*\n\nAlways virtuous in saving all things,\n*[for the Sage teaches the people to follow the four seasons,\nthus sparing all creatures from harm.]*\n\nThus, no thing is abandoned.\n*[The Sage does not deem stone less precious than jade,\nbut views them as equal.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nFirst, the Sage’s virtue extends to all sentient beings,\nthen, to all things—\nsaving beings directly through the common folk,\nsaving creatures through the four seasons—\nthis is called *clinging to clarity*.\n\n*[The Sage’s virtue in saving all things\nis called clinging to the clarity of Heaven’s Dao/Way.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*Clinging* means to uphold, to employ.\nThus, the Sage’s virtue in praising the Sage’s constancy,\nbenefiting all without abandon,\nmay be called upholding and employing the Sage’s Way.\n\nThe virtuous are teachers to the unvirtuous;\n*[those who practice virtue\nthe Sage takes as teachers for humanity.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe virtuous are those who follow the clarity of the Way,\never bearing a great mind,\nprioritizing others over themselves,\nguiding all beings—\ntruly the master craftsmen of the path.\n\nThe unvirtuous are the material for the virtuous;\n*[material, here meaning resource or means.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*[The Sage always transforms and guides the multitude,\nusing even the unvirtuous as a field of merit,\nfor the benefit of all beings\nthus perfects my virtue.]*\n\nThe Sage does not esteem their teachers,\n*[for there is no reliance.]*\nnor cherish their resources,\n*[for there is no purpose.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*[If one retains the notion of teachers and resources,\nthis is not yet the ultimate.]*\n\nNow, the reason the Sage esteems teachers\nis to preserve the form of learning;\nonce the form of learning is empty,\nnaturally there is no esteem.\nThe reason the Sage cherishes resources\nis to preserve the form of teaching;\nin teaching, forgetting teaching,\nthus no resources are cherished.\nEsteem and cherishing both forgotten,\nthe Dao/Way transforms naturally.\nThough one may seem deeply deluded,\n*[though one may think oneself knowing,\nthis person is truly great delusion.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*[There is no transformation.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nThe Sage guides the multitude,\nencouraging them to study and cultivate.\nNow, the Sage’s equality with the vulgar\ndiscards the notion of teachers and resources—\nthus, from shallow to profound,\ngradually ascending to all wonders,\nthis is called *essential subtlety*.\n\n*[One who grasps this meaning\nis said to know the subtle and essential Dao/Way.]*\n○ **Exegesis:**\nDiscarding teachers and resources,\nthe Sage and the vulgar are one—\nthough one may seem deeply deluded,\naccording to principle,\nthey truly attain essential subtlety.\n\nKnowing one’s strength as *yang*,\nguarding one’s weakness as *yin*,\none becomes the Dao/Way of the world’s valleys.\n*[Strength as *yang* symbolizes the exalted,\n*yin* the

into deep valleys.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis:**\n*Valley* means path.\n*Yang* is the name for the vigorous and harsh,\n*yin* for the gentle and tranquil.\nKnowing the vigor of *yang* leads to ruin and death,\n*yin*’s gentleness brings longevity—\nthus, discarding *yang* and guarding *yin*,\none attains the essential path of the world’s harmony.\n\n○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**\nThe *yang* is the *hun* soul—\nthe worthy scholar follows the Way,\nguarding natural spontaneity,\ndrawing in and closing the *qi*,\nembracing and holding the *hun* and *po* souls.\nConstant virtue never departs—\n*[For when one remains humble as a deep valley,\nvirtue abides and does not stray.]*\nReturn once more to the state of an infant.\n*[One must return one’s mind to the innocence of an infant,\nserene and without knowledge.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**\n*Valley* means *mouth*—\nwhen one practices *yi* (one-ness) and closes the *qi* in stillness,\nthere is no action.\n*[Thus, one does not age;\nreturning to the state of an infant.]*\n*[Exegesis:]* *Depart* means to disperse;\nthe infant is a metaphor for undifferentiated wisdom.\nWhen one constantly guards stillness,\nvirtue does not disperse,\nand thus returns to its original nature,\nreverting to wisdom without distinction.\n\nGuard its darkness,\nand become the model for all under Heaven.\n*[White symbolizes brilliance,\ndarkness symbolizes obscurity—\nthough one knows their own clarity,\nthey must also guard obscurity,\nas if in darkness with nothing to see—\nthus, they become the standard for all under Heaven,\nand virtue remains constant.]*\n*[Exegesis:]* White is luminous clarity.\nDarkness is obscurity.\n*Model* means *law*.\nTo display oneself openly and flaunt before others\nis certain to provoke resistance—\nnot the conduct of the wise.\nWithdrawing brilliance and concealing traces,\nretiring into obscurity,\none does not offend against things—\nthus, they are the virtuous person.\nThose who know the benefits and harms of light and dark\ncan serve as the grand exemplar for cultivators.\n\nTo become the model for all under Heaven,\nvirtue never falters—\n*[For when one becomes the standard for all under Heaven,\nvirtue abides within them,\nnever deviating.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**\nThis means the Dao is practiced in *yi* (one-ness) to attain transcendence,\nbecoming the model for all under Heaven.\nReturn once more to the *Wuji* (Non-Extreme).\n*[When virtue does not deviate,\nlongevity and eternal life are attained,\nand the body returns to the boundless.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**\nThis means constantly guarding the *sheng* (life) practice in *yi* (one-ness) without limit.\n*[Exegesis:]* *Deviate* means to stray.\n*Wuji* is the Dao.\nWhen one constantly abandons brightness and guards darkness,\nvirtue does not stray,\nrestoring purity and returning to the ultimate Dao.\n\nKnow its glory,\nguard its humiliation,\nand become the valley of all under Heaven.\n*[Glory symbolizes nobility,\nhumiliation symbolizes filth—\nthough one knows their own honor,\nthey must also guard humiliation,\nas if in filth—\nthus, all under Heaven will follow,\nlike water flowing into deep valleys.]*\n*[Exegesis:]* Glory is favor and nobility.\nHumiliation is lowliness and disgrace.\nDwelling in glory and nobility,\none may rise to arrogance and extravagance,\nand suddenly—\nas good fortune turns to misfortune and lust to ruin—\none’s former glory becomes the foundation of calamity.\nIf one knows that rise and fall are inconstant,\nthat nobility is the beginning of disaster,\none must restrain themselves\nand not indulge in dissipation.\nDwelling in splendor yet ever as lowly,\nnobility is rooted in humility,\nand height is founded on the lowly.\nThus, knowing glory and humiliation,\nall under Heaven will follow,\nlike rivers converging in the empty valleys.\n\nTo become the valley of all under Heaven,\nvirtue is then complete—\n*[Complete means to cease;\nwhen one becomes the valley for all under Heaven,\nvirtue finds its fulfillment within.]*\nReturn once more to *Pu* (the Uncarved).\n*[One must return to the simplicity of the unadorned,\nno longer adorned with artifice.]*\n\n○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**\nThis means guarding naturalness.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* *Pu* is the true origin.\nFrom knowing *yang* to ultimately guarding humiliation,\nthese three methods of cultivation\nare the essentials of the Dao.\nJust as the empty valley contains all sounds,\nso too does the constant Dao’s virtue\nthus find fulfillment,\nand one can return to true emptiness,\nreverting to the wondrous origin.\n\n*Pu* disperses into *qi* (vessels)—\n*[Vessels mean use;\nwhen the *Pu* of all things disperses,\nit becomes functional.]*\nThe Dao disperses into the numinous,\nflowing as the sun and moon,\nmanifesting as the Five Phases.\nThe Sage employs it,\nand becomes the ruler of officials.\n*[The Sage, ascending in use,\nbecomes the primal leader of all officials.]*\n*[Commentary:]* When virtue is internally harmonized,\none returns to *Pu*.\nWhen virtue is applied,\nit disperses into *qi* (vessels).\nOnce engaged in form and function,\nthere must be refinement and coarseness—\nthus, the Sage employs it to become the talents of the multitude and the leaders of officials.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* Disperses means to distribute.\n*Qi* means use.\n*Officials* refers to the sovereign.\n*Leaders* refers to teachers and masters.\nHaving returned to simplicity and restored purity,\nreverting to the wondrous origin,\none must descend from the origin to benefit the people.\nSpreading this purity and harmony as transformative use,\nthe *Xisheng Jing* says:\n*The Dao thus disperses and distributes,\nthen becomes the ruler to govern the world,\nthe teacher to guide the customs.*\nThe Sage employs this *Pu*,\ndispersing it into methods of governance and guidance.\nThus, the great measure knows no harm.\n*[The Sage governs the world with the great Dao,\nharming nothing;\ngoverning the body with the great Dao,\nharming no spirit.]*\n\n*[Exegesis:]* The supreme Sage’s divine power is unimaginable,\nsubduing all within the Three Realms.\nAs the sovereign of vast universes,\nthey are called the *Great Measure*.\nYet they refine all beings,\nmolding life—\nextending merit to things,\nnot ruling as a butcher.\nThus, it is said there is no harm.\n*Harm* means to slaughter.\n\nDesiring to take all under Heaven—\n*[Desiring to become the sovereign of all under Heaven.]*\nYet to act—\n*[Desiring to govern the people with deeds.]*\nI see that this is unavoidable.\n*[I see that this is contrary to the Dao and human nature—\nthe Dao abhors turmoil and filth,\nhuman nature abhors excess desire.]*\n\n*[Exegesis:]* When one is about to govern all under Heaven and transform the people,\none must empty the mind and forget desires.\nIf one governs with deeds,\nthe moment one attempts to transform,\none will fail—\nand this failure is already evident.\n\nAll under Heaven is the divine vessel—\n*[Vessel means thing;\nhumans are the divine things of all under Heaven.]*\nThe divine vessel loves tranquility,\nand cannot be governed by deeds.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* All sentient beings possess vitality,\nall capable of receiving the Dao,\nthus called the *divine vessel*.\n\nThe divine vessel is the **Imperial position**—\nIf one governs with **non-action** and tranquility,\nthen all beings and things flourish in harmony,\nbut if one governs with **deeds** and forced intervention,\nthen all sentient beings lose their **inherent nature**—\nthus, it cannot be governed by deeds.\n\nThose who **act** (with deeds) will **corrupt** it,\n*[Exegesis:]* Forcing governance upon it will spoil its **natural simplicity**.\nThose who **cling** will **lose** it.\n*[Exegesis:]* If one rigidly enforces teachings,\none will **fail** to grasp its **true essence**,\ngiving rise to **deceit and falsehood**.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* To stagnate and drown in **deeds** leads to **self-destruction and ruin**,\nto fixate on desires and greed brings **loss of state and nation**.\n\nThus, things sometimes **operate by themselves** or **follow others**,\n*[Exegesis:]* Whatever the **Sovereign** does,\nthe **subjects** will inevitably follow.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* Things—**all things**—are uncertain.\nSometimes they **act by their own nature**,\nsometimes they **conform to others**.\nThis illustrates that **authority and influence** are inherently unstable—\nsometimes **one prevails**, sometimes **one falters**.\n\nSometimes they **warm**, sometimes they **chill**,\n*[Exegesis:]* **Warm** (mild) and **chill** (harsh) are complementary.\nWhere there is warmth, there must be cold.\n*[Exegesis:]* Warmness symbolizes **wealth and honor**,\ncoldness symbolizes **poverty and lowly status**.\nThings may first be **wealthy and honored**, then **poor and lowly**,\njust as the **scarlet summer** blazes with heat,\nand the **dark winter** is piercing with cold.\nThe **Heavenly** alternates between **gentleness and severity**—\nhuman fortunes of **wealth and honor** are equally transient.\n\nSometimes they **strengthen**, sometimes they **weaken**,\n*[Exegesis:]* Where there is **strength**, there must be **frailty**.\n---\n\n「○ *Exegesis*: For great strength cannot endure long before decline—\nthus the next chapter states, *\"When things are at their peak, they grow old,\"*\nand the *Xi Sheng Jing* says: *\"The flourishing must decline.\"*\nThis is the principle of **flourishing and decline being unstable**.\n\nSometimes they **settle**, sometimes they **peril**.\n*[Exegesis:]* **Settle** means **stability**; **peril** means **danger**.\nWhere there is stability, there must be danger—\nthis illustrates that rulers must not act arbitrarily,\nwhether governing the state or cultivating the self.\n○ *Exegesis*: The *He Shang* text originally renders *\"or settle\"* as *\"or connect.\"*\n**Connection** means continuity; **ruin** means decay.\nContinuity and connection bring completion,\nwhile decay brings ruin—\nthis demonstrates the instability of stability and danger.\n\nThus *Zhuangzi* says: *\"What is completed is also destroyed.\"*\nBy enumerating these eight principles—\ntheir instability reveals that all things are impermanent—\nthose who govern the state or cultivate the self\nmust not cling to rigid actions or fixed outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **discards excess, extravagance, and excessiveness**.\n*[Exegesis:]* **Excess** refers to greed for sounds and colors,\n**extravagance** refers to carriages, attire, and drink,\n**excessiveness** refers to official halls and pavilions.\nBy abandoning these three, one abides in **moderation**,\nacts with **non-action (wuwei)**,\nand the world transforms naturally.\n○ *Exegesis*: The Sage, embracing the Dao, subtly embodies emptiness and falseness,\nthus does not cling to the eight principles above,\nbut instead practices the three below:\nExcess beautifies sounds and colors,\nextravagance adorns garments and ornaments,\nexcessiveness expands halls and pavilions.\nBy removing these three delusions,\ndwelling in the **central unity (zhongyi)**,\ngoverning the state ensures enduring blessings,\ncultivating the self ensures longevity and clear vision.\n\nFor those who **assist the ruler with the Dao**—\n*[Exegesis:]* Meaning the ruler strengthens themselves with the Dao—\nthey do not **coerce the world with arms**.\n*[Exegesis:]* By assisting the ruler with the Dao,\nnot relying on arms,\nfollowing the Dao and trusting in **virtue/power (de)**,\nenemies submit naturally.\n○ *Explanation*: This refers to—\nthe art of war itself.»\n\n...when words err, arms must follow,\nthen **spirit (shen)** surges and **soul (hun)** and **vital essence (po)** combine,\n**divine intelligence (shenming)** grows discontented and agitated—\nthen it abandons the body.\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* \"以\" means \"to use.\"\n\"佐\" means \"to assist.\"\n\"人主\" means \"the sovereign/ruler.\"\nThose who **use the Dao to assist the ruler**—\nshould **lay down arms and cultivate culture (yanshu xiuwen)**,\nguide them with **virtue/power (de)**,\nand not **overuse military force to coerce the world**.\nThe **internal wars of body and mind**—\nthat is, the **three afflictions (sanpo) and six senses (liujin)** as arms.\nTheir deeds return to themselves.\n○ *[Exegesis:]* \"好还\" means—\nwhen one steadies the heart and calms the will to act with **central unity (zhongyi)**,\nthis returns to their own person.\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* \"还\" means \"return\" or \"recompense.\"\nIf one **uses external arms**,\nand harbors resentment toward enemies within,\nor **applies the three poisons (sanduo)** internally—\nthen they invite the **three sufferings (santuo)** as recompense.\nThis is inevitable,\nhence it is said that their deeds return to themselves.\n\nWhere the **army (shi)** treads,\nthorns and brambles grow.\n○ *[Exegesis:]* Fields lie fallow, crops unplanted.\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* \"师\" means \"army.\"\nWhere **warhorses and soldiers** march,\nthey harm people and destroy things—\nonly thorns and weeds sprout,\nno grain grows.\nIt is the same as where the **desire-heart (yuxin)** roams unrestrained—\nonly evil deeds multiply,\nno good fortune arises.\n\nAfter a great army,\nthere must be years of calamity.\n○ *[Exegesis:]* Heaven responds with **harmful qi (ezhiqi)**,\nthen the five grains are blighted,\nthe five grains exhausted—\nthen people suffer.\n\nThe **virtuous (shan)** act with **resolute sincerity (guo)**—\n○ *[Exegesis:]* Those who practice goodness\nshould act with **resolute sincerity** alone,\nthat is, with **restraint (xiuxi)**.\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* \"果\" means \"resolute.\"\n\"已\" means \"to cease.\"\nThe **cultivated Daoist** resolutely ceases\nthis violent heart and does not wield arms.\n\nDo not **dare to take strength

acting under coercion or compulsion.\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* \"骄\" means **to disrespect superiors (mangshang)**,\n\"矜\" means **to boast before inferiors (kuaxia)**.\nThe **cultivated Daoist** must **practice modesty (qianxun)** and **yielding (ran)**,\nnot **seizing strength or violence (ziquiangbao)**,\nnor **bullying or arrogating power (mangkuai)**.\nThey must also **avoid

choosing,\nnot **delighting in war or conquest (lebingfa)**.\n\"勿强\" means—\nbefore the **knotted cords (jiehuang)** era,\n**resolute sincerity** was the **determined cessation of arms**.\n\nThis is **resolute yet not strong (guo er wujiang)**—\n○ *[Exegesis:]* **Resolute yet not relying on arms or fortified might (qujiangbianjia)** to oppress others.**\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* When enemies invade,\nif

*[Exegesis:]* \"物壮则老\" means—\nwhen **plants and trees reach their peak (zhuangji)**,\nthey wither and fall,\nand when **people reach their peak (zhuangji)**,\nthey grow decrepit and old.\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* Those who **overuse strength** cannot endure long.\n○ *[Exegesis:]* Just as **extreme heat must give way to cold (yanji zeleng)**,\nthis is the **constant principle of nature

\"death.\"*\n\n○ *[Exegesis:]* When **plants and trees reach their peak (zhuangji)**,\nthey wither and fall—\nwhen **arms grow strong (bingjiang)**,\nthey bring decline.\nSince they **do not practice modesty and yielding (buqianran)**,\nthey are **not true Daoists (feizhendao)**—\nthey must **cease and desist (zhiqi)**,\nnot **persist in such ways**.\n\nNow, **fine arms (jia bing)**—\nare **inauspicious instruments (bu xiang zhiqi)**—\n○ *[Exegesis:]* \"祥\" means \"good.\"\nArms **disturb the spirit (jing shen)** and **muddy harmonious qi (zhuo heqi)**,\nthey are **not good instruments

*Commentary:* **Left is the auspicious position (jwei),**\n**right is the mourning position (sangwei).**\n**Now, the lesser general is placed on the left,**\n**while the greater general is stationed

present, and thus it is honored.\"*\nThus, the recluses—Púchū, Xùyóu, Wángnǎi, and Nièquē—\nthese sages,\nthough reduced to poverty as common folk,\nwere never subjects of the Son of Heaven\nnor friends of the feudal lords—\nthis is their very essence.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nall things would come of their own accord in submission.\n\nCommentary:\nIf lords and kings could guard the Dao/Way and act without contrivance,\nall things would spontaneously submit and follow its virtue.\n\n○ *Cū says:* When a ruler aligns with the Dao’s virtue\nand harmonizes with the order of yin and yang,\nthen the four seasons proceed like jade candles,\nthe seven luminaries move without fault,\nand auspicious signs—strange plants, sweet dew—\nabound, leaving no want in the land.\nHow could this not be so?\nThe people need no command to be naturally balanced.\n\nCommentary:\n*Balanced* means harmonious.\n*None* means without.\nWhen virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nand clarity unites the three luminaries,\nthe people require no edicts—\nthey are spontaneously at peace.\nThe power of the Dao is beyond reckoning;\nits guardianship brings such benefits.\n\nWhen the Dao first established names,\nCommentary:\n*The Dao* refers to the Way,\n*names* to the myriad things.\nThe nameless Dao governs the named,\nthe formless governs the formed.\n\n○ *Cū says:* The named arises from the nameless,\nthe named illuminates the nameless—\nonly then can one guide the lost\nand lead them to awakening.\n\nWhen names have already been established,\nCommentary:\n*Exhausted* means fully realized.\nWhen the named things are complete in their desires,\nthey rebel against the Dao and forsake virtue,\nand thus bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nHeaven too will know when to stop,\nCommentary:\nIf one follows the Dao and practices virtue,\nHeaven itself will know when to cease.\n\n○ *Cū says:* The Dao has no designation,\nyet it descends to establish names—\nits intent is to guide beings toward their true path,\nreturning them to their root.\nOnce the metaphor is understood,\none must cease clinging to names\nand seek the reality beyond—\nlest one be ensnared by the snare,\nlosing sight of fish and hare alike.\n\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n\nCommentary:\nTo know when to stop is to invite the aid of the numinous—\nthen there is no longer danger.\n\n○ *Cū says:* Once the snare is forgotten,\nthe subtle truth is attained.\nWhen names converge with reality,\nthere is no peril.\n\nThe Dao/Way in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.\nCommentary:\nThe Dao/Way in the world,\nharmonizing with all things,\nis like rivers and valleys flowing into the sea.\n\n○ *Cū says:* The sea excels in receiving all rivers—\nthe Sage’s emptiness receives all beings.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The sea is king of the rivers because it excels in descending.\"*\n\nTo know people is wisdom,\nCommentary:\nTo discern people’s likes and dislikes—\nthis is wisdom.\n\n○ *Cū says:* To perceive the nature of others—discerning their subtleties, whether profound or shallow—without failing to know them fully: this is *other-heart wisdom*. To know oneself is clarity.\n\n*Commentary:* When one knows their own virtues and flaws, this is *listening in silence* and *gazing inward without form*—thus it is called clarity.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* The wise employ their intelligence to discern things, while the enlightened illuminate subtleties with radiant insight. Intelligence may have its limits, but enlightenment knows no bounds.\n\n○ *Cū says:* To know one’s past lives—both merit and sin—and the retributions of the three ages with perfect clarity: this is *host-fate wisdom*.\n\nTo overcome others is strength,\n*Commentary:* Those who overcome others do so only through coercive power.\n\n○ *Cū says:* Intelligence and strength overcome others; might subdues beings. Thus one subdues celestial demons and eliminates heterodox paths—this is *subduing-demons wisdom*.\n\n○ *Gù says:* Talent and capability may overcome others, but strength alone is fleeting. Those with strength must have adversaries. If one has adversaries, strength is not yet absolute. But to master one’s nature and temper emotions—that is *self-overcoming*. Those who overcome themselves have no rival within themselves, and thus may be called truly strong.\n\n*Self-overcoming is strength.*\n*Commentary:* When one conquers their own desires, none in the world can contend with them—thus they are strong.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* Those who can conquer others are merely strong in power. But those who conquer their own hearts, softening them, alone preserve their true strength.\n\n○ *Cū says:* To subdue one’s own mind, to master all entangling desires—when desires no longer arise, wisdom grows ever stronger: this is *severing-delusion wisdom*.\n\nTo know contentment is wealth,\n*Commentary:* When one knows sufficiency as sufficiency, they preserve fortune and blessing eternally—thus they are wealthy.\n\n○ *Cū says:* To guard one’s portion and know contentment is not merely to avoid poverty in wealth, but to be rich in virtue and morality. Further, to discern presence and absence—when all realms are illuminated, wisdom knows no lack, and thus is called *wealth*—this is *contentment wisdom*.\n\nTo act with vigor is resolve.\n*Commentary:* When one exerts strength in doing good, they are said to have resolve in the Dao, and the Dao responds in kind.\n\n○ *Jié says:* To practice the Dao without rest, day and night.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* Those who know contentment lack greed—thus they are wealthy. Those who act with vigor never falter—thus they possess resolve and principle.\n\n○ *Cū says:* *Resolve* is principle. When resolve is strong, great vows arise—prioritizing others over self, sacrificing one’s life to benefit beings, even in the final moments, never retreating.\n\nTo never lose one’s place is longevity.\n*Commentary:* When one preserves their vital essence, cherishing the heavens’ refined *qi*, they endure.\n\n○ *Jié says:* To never lose one’s singular essence.\n\n○ *Cū says:* Responding to circumstances with appropriate remedies, administering medicine to suit each ailment—all in perfect accord, never straying from what is fitting. Thus, in interacting with beings, one remains enduring and unyielding.\n\nTo die yet not perish is longevity.\n*Commentary:* Eyes do not gaze wantonly, ears do not listen indiscriminately, the mouth does not speak recklessly—thus no resentment lingers in the world, and one attains true longevity.\n\n○ *Jié says:* Referring to those who achieve *corpse dissolution*—dying only to be reborn.\n\n○ *Cū says:* When both deeds and vows are complete, inner and outer paths aligned, logically there should be no death or birth, no untimely end or extended life. Yet it is said, *\"To die yet not perish\"*—to clarify that death is not true death, and non-longevity is true longevity. The body may depart, but the Sage’s essence remains unchanged—thus it is called *longevity*.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* Death is the end of one’s appointed fate; perishing is the reversal of heaven’s will; longevity is the fulfillment of one’s allotted span. To know others and overcome them invites calamity, but contentment and vigor align with the natural order. To die yet not perish—this is the completion of one’s span, and thus may be called *longevity*.\n\nThe Great Dao is boundless,\n*Commentary:* The Dao is vast, like floating and sinking, presence and absence—visible yet unseen, spoken yet indistinct.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* The Great Dao is boundless, unrestrained yet responsive to all things, neither favoring left nor right.\n\nIts left and right are boundless.\n*Commentary:* The Dao can turn left or right, fitting all circumstances.\n\n○ *Cū says:* *Boundless* means unrestrained, also universal. The Dao is empty and mysterious, boundless in compassion, responding as it is moved—though neither yin nor yang, it adapts to left and right, revealing that square and round conform to things, exhausting all possibilities without fail. Hence *Zhuangzi* says: *\"There is left and right, there is right and wrong.\"*\n\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it does not decline.\n*Commentary:* All things depend on the Dao for existence, yet it never refuses or resists.\n\n○ *Cū says:* All things rely on the ultimate Dao for their formation, compassionately saving and guiding, never weary of effort. Further, things themselves do not decline—they arise naturally.\n\nIts achievements are unnamed.\n*Commentary:* The Dao does not claim credit for its accomplishments.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* All things rely on the harmonious *qi* of the Dao for transformation, yet the Dao does not decline in its labor. When its functions are complete, it does not claim ownership.\n\n○ *Cū says:* It nurtures all forms of life, its subtle work unseen, yet its merit is attributed to the things themselves—thus it does not claim the name of achievement.\n\nIt clothes all things yet is not their master—\nThis may be called *small*.\n*Commentary:* The Dao, though nurturing all things, does not rule like a sovereign.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* *Clothing* is akin to nurturing.\n\n○ *Cū says:* It clothes all beings, molding life—yet its divine function remains hidden, not assuming mastery. Humbling itself before things, it is rightly called *small*—though not truly small, but *small in name*.\n\nAll things return to it yet it does not rule—\nThis may be called *great*.\n*Commentary:* The Dao is vast as the empty sea, where all rivers converge. It does not rule as a sovereign—its meaning has been explained before. Since all things turn to the Dao, it rightly bears the name of *great*—though not truly great, but *great in name*.\n\nThus, the Sage never claims greatness,\n*Commentary:* The Sage follows the Dao, concealing virtue and hiding renown, not indulging in grandiosity.\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\n*Commentary:* The Sage embodies the Dao, acting without speech yet transforming all things, and thus attains true greatness.\n*Yuè says:* The Sage follows the Dao and forgets merit, never seeking to magnify itself, and so achieves true greatness.\n*Cū says:* The Sage who embodies the Dao forgets self for things, retreats in stillness and humility, never claiming greatness—only prioritizing others over self, forgetting merit and greatness. Thus, it becomes the leader of all beings, alone holding the highest honor in the Three Realms, and attains true greatness.\n\nHolding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven turns toward it.\n*Commentary:* *Holding* means upholding. *Symbol* refers to the Dao. The Sage upholds the Great Dao, and thus all people align their hearts and turn toward it. Governing the self, Heaven sends divine clarity, coming and going within it.\n*Cū says:* *Holding* means to grasp, yet it is grasping without grasping, grasping nothing. The Great Symbol is like the law of the Great Dao—just as the Sage who forgets greatness upholds the formless Great Symbol, always benefiting things, making all under Heaven turn toward it.\nAs in *Zhuangzi*: \"Wang Dai stood without teaching, sat without ruling, empty in departure, full in return.\" Confucius led all under Heaven to turn toward him.\nComing and going without harm,\nIt brings peace, stability, and harmony.\n*Commentary:* When all things turn without harm, the realm is secure, families are at peace, and great harmony prevails. Governing the self without harming the divine, the body remains secure and long-lived.\n*Yuè says:* Things turn without harm, and thus dwell in great peace.\n*Cū says:* *Great* means vast. The common people turn to the most sagely, all gaining benefit without loss. The benefit they gain is the law of peace and stability. Without harm, it reveals the removal of suffering; peace and stability speak of sharing in joy.\n\nJoy and delicacies—\nThe passing traveler stops.\n*Commentary:* *Delicacies* means beauty. The traveler is one. If one takes delight in the Dao’s beauty, they will stop and stay.\nOne is the absence of excess, dwelling in emptiness, like a passing traveler.\n\nThe Dao, when spoken of, is without taste.\n*Commentary:* The Dao, entering and exiting the mouth, is insipid—unlike the five flavors of sour, salty, bitter, sweet, and spicy.\n*Cū says:* The utmost Dao is empty and silent, its essence subtle and elusive. Thus, its speech is insipid and without allure, unlike music or fine foods that delight the senses. Music has sounds to please, delicacies have flavors to nourish—what is pleasing and satisfying makes even passing travelers stop and linger. But the Dao’s speech is insipid, and few scholars pause to reflect.\n\nAh, how deeply the world’s folly is obscured!\nThey can indulge in pleasing sounds,\nYet who can savor the tasteless taste?\n\nIt cannot be seen when gazed upon,\n*Commentary:* *Sufficient* means attainment. The Dao is formless—unlike the five colors of blue, yellow, red, white, and black that can be perceived.\n*Cū says:* The utmost Dao is profound and dark, transcending form and color. Unlike worldly teachings, it cannot be recognized by the eyes.\n\nIt cannot be heard when listened to,\n*Commentary:* The Dao is unlike the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—that can be heard.\n*Cū says:* The great sound is subtle and without pitch. It is not like the tones of *gong* and *shang*, nor can it be heard like bells and drums. The Sage’s speech follows this same principle.\n\nIts use cannot be exhausted.\n*Commentary:* Using the Dao to govern the realm brings wealth and prosperity to the people; governing the self extends life—there is no end to its use.\n*Yuè says:* With the Dao in stillness, there is no need for spoken instruction. Thus, it cannot be seen, cannot be heard. Pure winds prevail, all things flourish abundantly, and each year’s harvests overflow—so its use cannot be exhausted. *Exhausted* means finished.\n*Cū says:* The utmost Dao’s words are insipid and distant, neither sound nor color, transcending sight and hearing. Like a mirror’s reflection, things come and it responds; like the Sage’s wisdom, it responds intuitively. Thus, the use of the non-use is difficult to exhaust.\n\nWhen one would gather it,\nOne must first disperse it;\n*Commentary:* First, one opens and disperses to indulge in extreme decadence.\n*Cū says:* *Gather* means to contract, to restrain. To enact governance and transform all things, making them contract and not be corrupted by luxury, one must first open and indulge them, pushing them to extreme decadence. This was how Laozi, upon entering the Western Regions, first allowed their fierce and unrestrained nature to flourish before transforming them with the Dao.\n\nWhen one would weaken it,\nOne must first strengthen it;\n*Commentary:* First strengthening it is to invite disaster.\n*Cū says:* To make them return to the Dao’s gentle weakness, one must first push them to extreme strength, then guide them toward yielding softness.\n\nWhen one would abolish it,\nOne must first establish it;\n*Commentary:* First establishing it is to let their arrogance and excess reach danger.\n*Cū says:* To abolish their brutality, one must first indulge their ferocity. Once their ferocity reaches its peak, it can be abolished.\n\nWhen one would take from it,\nOne must first give to it.\n*Commentary:* First giving to it is to indulge their greed.\n\nThe *Cū* says:\nTo indulge their evil first is called *giving* to them.\nLater, to make them return to the Dao and goodness is called *taking* from them.\nThus, the Old Master first revealed the common and confused,\nSo as to indulge their obstinate and perverse nature.\nLater, when they witnessed the divine transformations,\nThe wicked were subdued, and only then could their ferocity be taken away,\nAnd they were led back to the virtuous Dao.\nThese four paired principles share similar logic—\nOnly differing in that the initial is shallow and the latter profound.\n\nThose of superior capacity, upon hearing the truth, immediately awaken.\nThose of inferior capacity require reliance on expedient means—\nThis is the *Increased Treatment of the Profound*.\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\n*Commentary:* These four matters—\nTheir Dao is subtle, yet their effects are clear.\n\n*Yuè* says:\nThe Classic states: *\"True speech seems contrary.\"*\nThe *Yì* says: *\"Compliance to act with expedience.\"*\nExpedience is contrary to the Classic yet harmonizes with principle.\nThus, the noble employ expedience when it aligns with principle,\nWhile the petty use it for deceit and guile.\nConfucius said: *\"One may entrust them with uprightness, but not with expedience.\"*\nIndeed.\n\nThus, the Old Master in the previous chapter demonstrated the Great Image—\nThis is called *truth*.\nThis chapter follows with contraction and expansion—\nThis is called *expedience*.\nTo measure the roots of sentient beings,\nHe thus demonstrated both expedience and truth,\nReversing appearances to reveal essence,\nSo that they must attain the realm of life and fate.\nYet the deluded claim this is not the intent of the Dao and its virtue—\nHow deeply they err and fail to awaken!\n\nWhen one seeks to contract and restrain the desires of sentient beings,\nFirst expand them, indulging their extravagant hearts,\nSo that they become ensnared in love and desire—\nThen contraction and restraint may follow.\nThe principles of strength and weakness are similarly applied.\nThis Dao is exceedingly subtle, yet its effects are clearly manifest—\nHence it is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nThe *Cū* says:\nThough the expedient Dao above is subtle and profound,\nIts verification is nonetheless evident.\nGentleness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength.\n\n*Commentary:* Gentleness and weakness endure,\nWhile rigidity and strength perish.\n\nThe *Cū* says:\nGentleness and weakness are *true wisdom*,\nRigidity and strength are *expedient wisdom*.\nTo teach and transform sentient beings,\nOne must employ expedient wisdom.\nIn definitive terms, *true wisdom* prevails.\n\nFish cannot be removed from the depths,\n*Commentary:* Fish removed from the depths\nGain softness by losing rigidity—\nThey can no longer be controlled.\n\nA state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to the people.\n*Commentary:* Sharp tools refer to the expedient Dao.\nThose who wield state expedience must not reveal it to officials,\nAnd those who practice the Dao of self-cultivation\nMust not reveal it to the unworthy.\n\nThe *Cū* says:\n*Detachment* means *loss*.\nSharp tools are *authority*.\nFish hidden in water, expedience concealed in the heart—\nThus nothing harms them.\nFish lost from water are seized by others,\nExpedience revealed to others is controlled by others—\nHence it must not be shown to others.\n\n*End of Volume Three of the Annotations on the Dao De Jing*\n#1: Original text reads *\"giant\"* (巨), corrected to *\"subject\"* (臣).\n\n*Volume Four of the Annotations on the Dao De Jing*\nNarrated by the *Chéngshì* of Wú Commandery, *Gù Huān*.\n\nThe Dao is ever without action yet without failing to act.\n*Commentary:* The Dao is always without action.\n*Exegesis:* The Dao of profound stillness is quiescent and without action, yet from its essence arises function, responding to things and transforming them—hence it is said to be without failing to act. The first sentence is the root, the second the manifestation; this clarifies root and manifestation, the interplay of stillness and motion.\n\n*Cai* says: The Dao’s essence is congealed and still, its true realm unmoving—hence it is said to be without action. Yet it responds to things and moves; nothing is left unused—hence it is said to be without failing to act. If lords and kings could uphold it, all things would spontaneously transform.\n*Commentary:* If lords and kings could uphold the Dao, all things would spontaneously transform, benefiting themselves.\n*Yu* says: The wondrous root is pure and pristine, hence always without action. Things rely on it to thrive, yet it is without failing to act. If lords and kings could uphold the Dao’s non-action, all things would spontaneously transform. The ruler’s non-action brings the world to simplicity and purity.\n*Exegesis:* Even sovereigns of ten thousand chariots, rulers of the five ranks—if they could uphold this Dao, the eight extremes and myriad lands would naturally follow its transformation. The same applies to commoners. The reason this passage emphasizes lords and kings is to show that rulers lead transformation, benefiting and expanding for all.\n*Du* says: Virtue can subdue things; the Dao is present, and thus the sovereign is honored. Kings who uphold the Dao do not command—yet all is balanced. Dukes and marquises embrace virtue without severity, yet all is transformed.\n*Luo* (Rushen) *Inner Explanation* says: The mind attains emptiness yet does not lose its resources; all spirits follow transformation, and evil is subdued, returning to the right path.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act, I shall restrain it with the nameless Primal Simplicity.\n*Commentary:* \"I\" refers to the self; the nameless Primal Simplicity is the Dao. All things transform, benefiting themselves.\n*Yu* says: When people have followed the ruler’s transformation—non-action, pure and pristine—and yet still desire to act and do, I shall restrain them with the nameless Primal Simplicity, which is the Dao.\n*Exegesis:* \"Act\" means to begin cultivation. \"Primal Simplicity\" is the Dao. It says that when beings first begin cultivation, they must have desires for fruition. Once such desires arise, one must settle their mind with the nameless, pristine Dao, so that it is not stained by the worldly—this is to dispel the \"having\" with the \"non.\"\n*Gu* says: \"Act\" means deceit arises. It says that when a lord upholds the Dao, all things follow transformation, yet someone from within this harmony might harbor deceitful intentions. The Master says, \"I shall restrain them with the Dao.\" Again: \"Make their hearts chaotic, so that there is no distinction.\" Again: \"The nameless Primal Simplicity is instruction.\" The nameless Primal Simplicity also does not desire; not desiring is stillness.\n*Commentary:* It says that when a ruler restrains with virtue and the Dao, the people will also not desire, hence one must guide them with purity and stillness.\n*Exegesis:* Not only must one not desire the \"having\" of laws, but one must also not desire the \"non\" of this nameless purity. Earlier, the \"non\" dispelled the \"having\"; now, the \"non\" dispels the \"non.\" Having and non are both dispelled, departing from the single Middle Way. The world will then spontaneously rectify itself.\n*Commentary:* Stillness is cessation. Earlier, the nameless dispelled the having; next, not desiring dispelled the non. Having and non having are both dispelled, not desiring is then extinguished, and not desiring removed, the single Middle is effaced. This is dispelling again and again, the mysterious beyond the mysterious—what is called probing the subtle, seeking the hidden, exhausting principle, and perfecting nature. Then all dharmas are without exception true and genuine; even weeds and tiles are all the utmost Dao—hence it is said the world spontaneously rectifies itself. This one sentence seals the gate of all mysteries.\n*Yu* says: The nameless Primal Simplicity also does not desire—it says that when the ruler has restrained with the nameless Primal Simplicity, the common people must not cling to this namelessness, lest they seek to advance and lose their root, falling back into action. Hence, even this nameless Primal Simplicity must be forgotten. Not desiring desire, not desiring is also forgotten—pure and pristine, the world spontaneously rectifies itself.\nAgain: The Dao is ever without desire, delighting in purity, hence it makes heaven and earth ever rectified. Heaven and earth are the Dao’s subjects; when the ruler follows the Dao and issues precepts, the hearts of all subjects will spontaneously rectify.\n\nThe highest virtue does not claim virtue, hence it has virtue;\n*Commentary:* The highest virtue refers to the ancient sovereign without name—his virtue is great yet unnamed, hence it is called highest virtue. \"Not claiming virtue\" means he does not teach virtue to the people; he follows nature, nurturing human life and vitality, his virtue unseen—hence it is said he does not claim virtue. It says his virtue aligns with heaven and earth, harmonious *qi* flowing, and the people are thereby preserved.\n*Exegesis:* \"Highest\" means elevated, a name for transcendence. \"Virtue\" means attainment, with the sense of achieving. It says those of highest virtue intuitively grasp the Dao’s realm; their insight is obscure yet unified, attainment and loss both forgotten. Attainment and loss forgotten—hence it is said they do not claim virtue. Insight obscure yet unified—hence it is said they have virtue. Having virtue dispels loss; not claiming virtue dispels attainment.\n\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue, hence it has no virtue.\n*Commentary:* The lower virtue refers to the named sovereign—his virtue does not reach that of the highest, hence it is called lower virtue. \"Not losing virtue\" means his virtue is visible, his deeds praiseworthy. Since he bears a name and title, it is said he has no virtue.\nThe highest virtue acts without action, yet there is nothing it does not act upon;\n*Commentary:* It says the Dao’s law is tranquil, without contrivance, hence there is no need for a name.\n*Exegesis:* \"Act upon\" means to use. The highest virtue acts without action, reaching the root of congealed stillness, yet its manifestation is empty and wondrous—this is called non-action yet action; action is precisely non-action.\n\nThe lower virtue acts with contrivance, yet there is something it does act upon.\n*Commentary:* It speaks of a sovereign who enforces teachings and policies, all for his own sake, and claims a name for himself. ○*Exegesis:* Since his heart does not forget virtue, he is called \"for it.\" Yet he still has affairs to attend to, hence it is said he acts with contrivance.\n\nThe highest virtue acts with benevolence, yet there is nothing it does not transcend.\n*Commentary:* The highest virtue refers to a sovereign who practices benevolence without equal, hence it is called the highest virtue. \"Acts with benevolence\" means to extend compassion. When deeds are accomplished and affairs established, there is nothing to cling to as a means. ○*Exegesis:* Benevolence is compassion—it arises from a mind of nurturing. Since he does not value reciprocal kindness, it is said he transcends contrivance. Though the highest virtue is not as profound as the lower virtue, in terms of moral rectitude, benevolence surpasses it, hence it is called \"transcend contrivance.\" Within the Three Jewels, compassion is paramount, so among the Five Virtues, benevolence is also placed first.\n\nThe highest righteousness acts with contrivance, yet there is something it does act upon.\n*Commentary:* It acts with righteousness to sever and cut away—his actions are for his own sake, killing to establish his authority, taxing the people to sustain his own indulgence. ○*Exegesis:* Righteousness upholds the correction of evil and the punishment of wrongdoing, as seen in the scriptures’ precepts and disciplines. Yet the essence of these precepts, when applied to lower beings, still involves contrivance; they have not yet reached the realm of empty and wondrous non-action, hence it is said he acts with contrivance.\n\nThe highest propriety acts, yet none respond to it.\n*Commentary:* It refers to a sovereign whose propriety is without equal. \"Acts\" means to establish rites, institutions, and ceremonial authority. It speaks of propriety being ornate yet inwardly decayed, adorned with falsehood and excessive detail—any movement departs from the Dao, and thus it cannot be responded to. ○*Exegesis:* Propriety emphasizes ceremonial decorum, as seen in the scriptures’ teachings on fasting, rituals, and etiquette. Moreover, the highest Dao is boundless and tranquil, its great form without substance; yet now it is devalued, the simple esteemed over the elaborate, the plain over the ornate, and only ceremonial authority is upheld. Though it may be a gradual teaching, it fails to align with true principle, not only contradicting the Dao internally but also unable to harmonize with the external world, hence it is said none respond to it. ○*Lu’s Saying:* The rites of jade and silk are used as tokens for betrothal, hence it is called \"highest.\" Rank and title are conferred in due measure, hence it is said \"acts.\" Yet with so many ceremonial details, the jade and silk are exhausted, and the people cannot sustain the sovereign, hence it is said \"none respond to it.\" Because none respond, punishments are enforced. Then, he raises his arm in anger and drags others into conflict.\n*Commentary:* It speaks of how, when propriety is too burdensome to be followed, the sovereign and the people grow resentful, hence he raises his arm in anger and drags others into contention. ○*Yu’s Saying:* Propriety emphasizes reciprocity and mutual expectation. Because of its shallow observance, he raises his arm in anger and drags others into conflict, desiring to make clear the flaws of teaching propriety. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Rujiu is thin, yet Handan was besieged\"—this is its case. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue alone remains.\n\n「○*Commentary:* Virtue here refers to the **highest virtue** (上德). When the **Dao/Way** declines and the people grow weary, its transformative power fades, and only then does **virtue/power** manifest. It responds to things according to their time, but **virtue/power** of the lower order appears only when the **Dao/Way** is lost.\n\nWhen **virtue/power** is lost, **benevolence** (仁) emerges,\n　　○*Commentary:* It means that as **virtue/power** wanes, **benevolence** and love take its place.\n\nWhen **benevolence** is lost, **righteousness** (義) arises,\n　　○*Commentary:* When **benevolence**’s compassion fails to prevail, **righteousness**’s distinctions then arise.\n\nWhen **righteousness** is lost, **propriety** (礼) is practiced.\n\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* Those who lose the **Dao/Way** lose the **highest virtue**, for the **highest virtue** aligns with the **Dao/Way**, hence it is said \"lose the **Dao/Way**.\"\n\nNow, **virtue/power**, **benevolence**, **righteousness**, and **propriety** are merely the names of refined and coarse customs in different times. Thus, when the **Dao/Way** declines, **virtue/power** appears; when **virtue/power** is lost, **benevolence** remains; when **benevolence** fades, **righteousness** stands forth; when **righteousness** is gone, **propriety** is resorted to—these are all fitting measures for their times. Therefore, when discussing **propriety** in the age of simplicity and purity (淳朴), it is either madness or perversity; when **propriety** is forgotten in the age of artificiality and corruption (浇醨), it is either foolishness or slander. If one can dissolve and transcend these layers, they should abandon **propriety** to uphold **righteousness**, abandon **righteousness** to uphold **benevolence**, abandon **benevolence** to uphold **virtue/power**, and forget **virtue/power** to return to the **Dao/Way**, thus restoring simplicity and purity. Then, the **highest virtue** will have nothing to rely upon.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* From the **Dao/Way**’s decline in the age of artificiality and corruption to its uttermost extreme, unable to curb evil, **propriety** is then employed for ritual and etiquette. Though it may forcefully establish ceremonial decorum, its superficiality only grows worse.\n\n**Propriety** is the thinning of **loyalty and trustworthiness** (忠信),\n　　○*Commentary:* It means that **propriety**, though it regulates external forms, neglects its roots—**loyalty and trustworthiness**—and thus these virtues grow ever more shallow.\n\nAnd the beginning of **chaos**.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Propriety** values outward display over inner sincerity, so the upright and honest dwindle while licentiousness and disorder flourish.\n\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Propriety** is meant to rescue **chaos**, yet it esteems rigid knowledge. Those who cling to **propriety**’s outward forms—who prize jade and silk, who revere bowing and kneeling—are the very ones who become the starting point of **foolishness and ignorance**.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* Those who claim to know without true understanding are called **pretense of knowledge** (前识). This is the case of those who have lost the **Dao/Way**’s substance but cling to its superficial trappings. Such **pretense of knowledge** is the origin of **stupidity and darkness**.\n\n　　○*Gu’s Saying:* **Pretense of knowledge** refers to those who do not await deep inquiry. Now, the pure and subtle **Dao/Way** is profound beyond comprehension, formless and colorless—its truth lies within itself. Yet those who rely on elaborate discourse and ornate displays, who flaunt ceremonial splendor and arrayed beauty, these are not the **Dao/Way**’s true essence but its superficial adornments, the beginning of **stupidity**.\n\nWhen **stupidity** first takes root, it has not yet encountered the **Dao/Way**’s true reality, so it is led astray by **pretense of knowledge**. The **Dao/Way**’s superficiality corrupts its very beginning. The *Sequence of Families* says: This interpretation is the most refined.\n\nTherefore, the **great man** (大丈夫) dwells in the **thick substance** (厚),\n　　○*Commentary:* **Great man** refers to one of **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—a leader who sustains the people with courage, compassion, and wisdom. His aspirations are vast and universal, hence the name **great man**.\n\nBut not in the **thin veneer** (薄).\n\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Artifice** (有为) is the **Dao/Way**’s thinness. **Propriety** and **righteousness** are the **virtue/power**’s superficial adornments. Thus, the sage dwells in the **Dao/Way**’s **non-artifice** (无为), which is its **thick substance**.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* The **great man** of the **Dao/Way**, the transcendent scholar, should anchor his emotions in **virtue/power**’s true essence, not fixate on the **pretense of knowledge**’s superficial trappings. Hence, he discards the latter for the former.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* Discarding the **thin veneer** means severing **benevolence** and **righteousness**. Taking the **thick substance** means returning to simplicity and purity. Moreover, the **highest virtue** of the sage embodies **non-duality** (无分别), so how could he ever fixate on distinctions or be entangled in discarding and taking? Indeed, it is not a matter of discarding what is not to be discarded, nor of taking what is not to be taken. The same holds true for the **Dao/Way**’s duality of superficiality and substance.\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained **Oneness** (一):\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Oneness** is the **wonderful harmony of pure and subtle qi** (冲和之妙气).\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Ancient** refers to the past. It speaks of those who attained the **Dao/Way** in bygone ages, and their condition is fully described in the following text. This is **Yu** citing the past to elucidate the present.\n\nThe heavens attained **Oneness** with **clarity** (清),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the **muddy pellet** (泥丸) within the human head emits **pure qi**, which descends to illuminate, hence it is said \"with **clarity**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* The heavens absorb the **Dao/Way**’s **qi**, thus gathering **yang** to form the sky, which remains **clear and elevated** above.\n\nThe earth attained **Oneness** with **tranquility** (宁),\n　　○*Commentary:* The earth, too, absorbs the **Dao/Way**’s **Oneness**, thus congealing **yin** to form the earth, which remains **tranquil and still** below.\n\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the **elixir field** (丹田) does not indulge in licentiousness or disorder, and **spirit** (神) resides within the body, hence it is said \"with **tranquility**.\"\n\nThe **spirit** (神) attained **Oneness** with **aliveness** (灵),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* **Spirit** refers to the **heart** (心). The **heart** is the **alive spirit** of the five **zang** organs (五藏), hence it is said \"with **aliveness**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* It means that the **spirit** attains **Oneness**, hence its ability to **transform and manifest without form**.»\n\nThe **Dao/Way** dwells in **yin**, dark and unfathomable,\n　　○*Commentary:* By its **Oneness**, it achieves boundless **aliveness** and **wisdom**, hence *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The spirits and the **Dao/Way**’s **Imperial Sovereign** (神帝) generate the heavens and the earth.\"*\n\nThe **valleys** (谷) attained **Oneness** with **fullness** (盈),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* The **valleys**—that is, the **Huaxi Palace** (华池宫)—can summon the **elixir spring** (醴泉), hence it is said \"with **fullness**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* The **valleys** (谷) are mountain basins. By attaining **Oneness**, they can nourish flowing springs and fill the **Han moats** (汉壑) with abundance.\n\nThe **ten thousand things** (万物) attained **Oneness** with **birth** (生),\n　　○*Commentary:* All sentient and insentient beings, collectively called the **ten thousand things**, share **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way**, hence they come to **birth** and **manifestation**.\n\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that all things, though of varied forms, equally attain **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way** to bring forth life, hence it is said \"with **birth**.\"\n\nThe **feudal lords and kings** (侯王) attained **Oneness** to govern the **world** (天下) with **rectitude** (正).\n　　○*Commentary:* Feudal lords and kings alike observe the **Dao/Way** to transform, and by embracing **non-action** (无为) to attain **Oneness**, they can administer the world’s **affairs** (政). The examples are **Fangxun** (放勋) and **Wenming** (文命).\n\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It refers to the **spleen** (脾). Positioned in the **central yellow** (中黄), it governs the four directions through **Oneness**, hence it is said \"with **rectitude**.\"\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s** **manifestation** (致) is thus,\n　　○*Yu’s Interpretation:* When things attain the **Dao/Way**, they are named accordingly. The **Dao/Way** persists, names stand; the **Dao/Way** fades, reality perishes. Hence, the heavens’ **clarity**, the earth’s **tranquility**, the **spirit’s** **aliveness**, and the **valleys’** **fullness** all arise from **wondrous application** (妙用) of the **Dao/Way**, thus it is said \"its **manifestation**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Manifestation** (致) means **attainment**. It unifies the preceding six affairs, all of which attain **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way**. The *Inner Resolution* says: \"This is the **sixfold practice** (六种行门) of a single individual.\"\n\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the heavens, earth, humans, **spirit**, **elixir waters**, **springs**, and the **ten thousand things** all attain **Oneness** to manifest, hence it is said \"its **manifestation**.\"\n\nThe heavens, without **clarity**, would fear **rupture** (裂),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **marrow pellet** (泥丸) does not attain **Oneness**, then the **brain** (脑) will wither, the **head’s white** (桔头白) will fade, and the **teeth** (齿) will fall out, hence it is said \"rupture.\"\n\nThe earth, without **tranquility**, would fear **outburst** (发),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **elixir field** (丹田) does not attain **Oneness**, then the **essence-qi** (精气) will dissipate, hence it is said \"fear **outburst**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Outburst** (发) means **change and movement**. If the earth cannot apply the **Dao/Way** to remain **tranquil**, then disasters like **collapse** (崩沦) may arise. In ancient times, the **Qishan mountain** (岐山) collapsed, causing the **three rivers** (三川) to tremble—this is the case.\n\nThe **spirit**, without **aliveness**, would fear **extinction** (歇),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **heart** (心) is disordered and does not uphold **Oneness**, then the body will **hollow out** (空) and age prematurely, hence it is said \"fear **extinction**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Extinction** (歇) means **decay**. If the **spirit** does not rely on the **Dao/Way**, then **wisdom and application** (智用) will grow **stupid and sluggish** (愚怠), lacking **aliveness**, and will fear **extinction** and **obliteration**.\n\nThe **valleys**, without **fullness**, would fear **exhaustion** (竭),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **Huaxi Palace** (华池宫) loses its **Oneness**, then it will lack **vital fluids** (津液), hence it is said \"exhaustion.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Exhaustion** (竭) means **blockage**. If the **valleys** (川谷) deviate from **Oneness**, then calamities will begin, causing the **springs** to dry up and the **flowing channels** (流注) to stagnate.\n\nThe **ten thousand things**, without **birth**, would fear **annihilation** (灭),\n　　○*Commentary:* All the **ten thousand things** attain **birth** through **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way**; if they lose the **Dao/Way** and deviate from **truth**, then they will perish in an instant.\n\nThe **feudal lords and kings**, without **nobility and elevation** (贵高), would fear **overthrow** (蹶),\n　　○*Yu’s Interpretation:* Those who attain **Oneness** must not boast of their **application**. The **Sages** (圣人) taught that their purpose is for the **living beings** (生灵), though they may elevate the heavens and earth to **clarity** and **tranquility**, their ultimate convergence lies in the **feudal lords and kings** practicing **humility** (谦和) and adhering to the **Dao/Way of female stillness** (雌静), thus avoiding **overthrow** or **annihilation**.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Overthrow** (蹶) means **ruin**. If rulers cannot apply the **Dao/Way** to maintain their **nobility**, acting against **principle** (理) and **virtue** (德), then their **divine instruments** (神器) will fall into **disorder**, and their **states** (社稷) will face **peril**. The tyrants **Jie of Xia** (夏桀) and **Zhou of Shang** (殷纣) are such examples.\n\nThus, **nobility** must take **humility** as its foundation,\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that those who seek **long life** (长生) must regard **original qi** (元气) as their **mother**, hence it is said \"its foundation.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Nobility** (贵) refers to **elevation** and **exaltation**. **Humility** (贱) means **lowliness**.\n\nThe ruler who attains **Oneness** (得一之君) thus remains humble,\nwhile the ruler who loses the **Dao/Way** (失道之主) falls into arrogance and pride.\nHence, arrogance and pride are the foundation of lowliness,\nand humility is the root of exaltation.\nBy measuring gain and loss,\none establishes this admonition.\n\n**Exaltation** must take **humility** as its foundation.\n○*Annotation:* It means that if one seeks true nobility,\nthey must take **humility** as their foundation—\njust as when building walls or structures,\none must first establish a low base;\nif the foundation is not firm,\nthe structure will inevitably collapse.\n\n○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that those who cultivate **Dao/Way** to nourish **essence** (精) and supplement the **marrow** (脑) must use the **elixir field** (丹田) as their foundation—\nthus, it is the foundation.\n\n○*Gu’s Commentary:* Those who speak of **exaltation** taking **humility** as its foundation\ndo not attain nobility by themselves—\nthey are elevated by what the lowly revere.\nThey do not rise by themselves—\nthey are borne aloft by what is beneath them.\nThus, nobility depends on humility—\nhow could one not take **humility** as the root?\n\nTherefore, the wise cultivate the foundation,\nand thus remain humble without peril.\nThe foolish pursue superficiality,\nand thus reach for heights only to fall.\n\nHence, rulers call themselves **\"lonely and bereft\"** (孤寡).\n○*Annotation:* **\"Lonely\"** (孤) signifies solitude,\n**\"bereft\"** (寡) signifies inability—\nlike a wheel hub (毂) that cannot be the center\nfor all spokes to gather.\nThough kings and lords are most exalted,\nthey call themselves thus—\nis this not taking **humility** as their foundation,\nto enlighten the people?\n\n○*Commentary:* **\"Bereft\"** (不毂) means unworthy.\nRulers, wise and enlightened,\nknow that arrogance is the root of self-destruction,\nwhile humility is the foundation of true nobility.\nThus, they govern the common people,\nshepherding themselves with humility.\n\n○*Gu’s Commentary:* **\"Bereft\"** (不毂) means unworthy.\nIt means that **virtue** (德) is not something to be worshipped—\none cannot command the words of the multitude.\nAll three of these—\nthe ruler’s self-designation, the people’s revulsion,\nand the ruler’s own humility—\nare ways of taking **humility** as the foundation.\nIs this not so?\n○*Annotation:* **\"Is this not so?\"** (非乎) is merely an exclamatory rhetorical question.\n\n○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It is not that their **Dao/Way** is **Original Oneness** (元一).\nThus, they achieve **\"ten thousand chariots without a chariot\"** (致数车无车).\n○*Annotation:* **\"Achieve\"** (致) means to gather—\npeople gather around the chariot’s components:\nspokes, wheels, hub, yoke, axle, and shaft,\nyet none of these is called a chariot;\nonly when assembled do they become one.\nThus, rulers do not name themselves by their exalted titles,\nand so their nobility is complete.\n\n○*Commentary:* The box, cover, hub, and rim—\nartificial combinations—\nthough called a chariot, lack true substance.\nThe five elements and four great forces are likewise illusory;\nsince the body is inherently empty,\nwhere then would nobility reside?\nThus, when in a position of nobility,\none must practice humility.\n\n○*Cai’s Commentary:* **\"Praise\"** (誉) refers to both praise and blame.\nIt means that a **Dao/Way**-governed ruler,\nhumble in self-cultivation,\nforgets distinctions of nobility and lowliness,\nand thus transcends both praise and blame.\nThough people frequently extol his virtues,\nhe does not consider himself noble;\nthough they frequently condemn his failings,\nhe does not consider himself lowly.\n\n○*Gu’s Commentary:* It means that the **noble person** (君子) establishes **moral cultivation** (道德功行) in mind and body.\nWithout virtue to display,\nwithout traces to reveal,\ntheir roots run deep and their foundations are firm—\nunshaken by praise or blame,\ndesire or aversion.\n\n**\"Do not be polished like jade, nor rigid like stone.\"**\n○*Yu’s Annotation:* **\"Jing-jing\"** (琭琭) describes jade’s appearance,\n**\"luo-luo\"** (落落) describes stone’s appearance.\nThis is taking **humility** as the foundation.\n\n**\"The inverted is the movement of the Dao.\"**\n○*Annotation:* This clarifies **strategic adaptation** (权).\n**\"The inverted\"** refers to reversing conventional principles to align with meaning.\n\n**\"The weak is the application of the Dao.\"**\n○*Annotation:* This clarifies **substance** (实).\n\nThe weak is taken for its yielding softness and receptive stillness—\nreceptive stillness is how the Sage abides in substance.\nTo abide in substance is the Dao’s constant application,\nthus it is said: *The weak is the Dao’s use.*\n\nAll things under Heaven are born of *having*,\n*—for all things arise from Heaven and Earth’s form and place.*\nHaving is born of *non-being*,\n*—for Heaven and Earth’s mysteries, the fluttering and crawling of life,*\n*all arise from the Dao, which is formless and nameless.*\nThis speaks of the root prevailing over the flourishing,\nthe weak prevailing over the strong,\nhumility prevailing over fullness.\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nSubstance and strategy are like non-being generating having—\nthus those who practice strategy must return to substance,\nand those who employ having must rely on non-being.\nYet the ultimate Dao is boundless and silent,\nfree from names and forms.\nAll dharmas are of empty nature,\nnot dependent on each other.\nIf one can forget both strategy and substance,\nand merge having and non-being,\nthen neither counting nor not-counting exists—\nthis may be called transcendence.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Having* is the Dao’s manifestation—\nthe so-called *One Qi of non-being*.\nThe primal One is the wondrous root—\nthe so-called *silent and empty realm*.\nAll things under Heaven arise from the Dao’s manifested laws,\nand these laws themselves arise from the wondrous root—\nthe ultimate non-being.\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao and strives to practice it.\n*—The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, exerts utmost effort to practice it.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe superior in wisdom, hearing the Dao,\ninstantly comprehends that all phenomena are empty,\nthus they diligently cultivate without hesitation or laziness.\n\nThe middle person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly.\n*—The middle person, hearing the Dao,*\n*seeks longevity through self-cultivation,*\n*and seeks peace for the realm,*\n*yet when confronted with wealth, desire, or honor,*\n*they are confused by passions and abandon it.*\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nThe middle person may ascend or descend,\nthus they are doubtful—\nsometimes holding, sometimes losing.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe middle in wisdom, dim in insight,\ncannot fully grasp the principles.\nThough they hear the Dao, they fail to penetrate its depths.\nIf they restrain their emotions and return to stillness,\nthey may briefly attain emptiness of mind,\nbut once immersed in worldly affairs,\nthey become entangled in the realm of having,\nvacillating between gain and loss—\nthus it is said: *uncertain holding or losing.*\n\nThe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it.\n*—The inferior person, greedy and desiring,*\n*sees the Dao’s softness as terrifying,*\n*sees its simplicity as vulgar,*\n*thus they laugh loudly.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe inferior in wisdom, dull and obtuse,\nhearing the profound and vast truths of the Dao,\nfail to comprehend and deem them empty fables,\nthus they scoff and laugh aloud.\n\nIf it is not laughed at, it is not the Dao.\n*—That which is not laughed at by the inferior is not worthy to be called the Dao.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThat which is not scorned by the vulgar\nis not worthy to be called the Sage’s Way.\n\nThus, the establishment of speech is as follows:\n*—The method of establishing the Dao is as in the six lines below.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Establishment*—to set forth.\nThe Dao practiced by the superior is established in the following:\n\nThe enlightened one appears as if in darkness,\n*—The one who illuminates the Dao*\n*appears as if blind and ignorant,*\n*concealing their brilliance among the common.*\n\nThe one advancing in the Dao appears as if retreating,\n*—The great scholar*\n*does not reveal their progress,*\n*though internally cultivating,*\n*externally they seem to decline.*\n\nThe one in harmony with the Dao blends with the common,\n*—*Harmony*—levelness.\nThe great Daoist does not distinguish themselves,\nappearing as if among many.*\n\nThe Sage’s virtue is like a deep valley,\n*—The Sage of highest virtue*\n*is like a valley,*\n*unashamed by filth or dampness.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe one who excels in moral cultivation\nis equal to the boundless void,\nthus they can embrace all things,\nlike an empty valley.\n*[Original note:]* Those who forget virtue\ndo not differ from the vulgar.\n\nThe greatly pure appear as if shamed,\n*—The greatly pure and virtuous*\n*appear as if stained,*\n*not displaying themselves.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Purity*—cleanness.\n*Shame*—defilement.\nThe one of great purity and high conduct\nblends with the dust,\ndoes not dazzle others,\nthus they can mix unnoticed—\nlike defilement.\n\nHence, the Eastern Sage purifies their Way\nwhile staining their traces—\nthis is the very meaning.\n\nThe broadly virtuous appear insufficient,\n*—The one of vast virtue*\n*appears as if foolish and lacking.*\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nGreat achievement while holding humility.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe one bearing great virtue,\nabiding in Daoic forgetfulness,\ninternally overflows,\nyet externally appears deficient.\n\nLaozi’s transmission states:\n*The skilled merchant hides deeply like emptiness,*\n*The Sage of great virtue appears as if foolish.*\n\nThe one establishing virtue appears as if deceitful,\n*—The one establishing morality*\n*appears as if stealing,*\n*hiding their name and progress,*\n*like one who acts secretly,*\n*thus the Classic says:*\n*‘As if fearing their neighbors.’*\n\nThe genuine appear as if false,\n*—The genuine and sincere*\n*appear as if their colors fade,*\n*unclear.*\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nPure and harmonious in light.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Genuine*—substance.\n*False*—change.\nThe scholar of pure substance,\nstill yet moving,\ntrue yet responsive,\ntheir changes reveal impermanence—\nthus they appear as if false.\n\nThe great square has no corners,\n*—The great and square*\n*has no crookedness or angles.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Corner*—angle.\nThe one embodying the great square\nfollows things naturally,\ndoes not cling to principles,\ndoes not establish petty angles—\nas said: *‘The superior transcends all nodes.’*\n\nGreat vessels take long to mature,\n*—The great vessel*\n*is like the Nine Cauldrons and coral ornaments,*\n*not formed hastily.*\n\n○ *Exegesis:*\nThe Nine Cauldrons and coral ornaments\nare not formed in a single day—\na parable for the scholar of the Great Learning,\nwho cannot swiftly attain enlightenment.\nThey must accumulate eons of cultivation and vigilance\nbefore attaining the utmost emptiness—\nthus the tale of *Ren’s Son* fishing in astonishment.\n\n○ *Sectional Analysis:*\nIt speaks of steadfastly abiding in the One without peril,\nand thus, in aging, attaining the Dao.\n\n*The Great Sound is rare in voice,*\n*—The Great Sound, like thunder,*\n*awaits its moment to move—*\n*a metaphor for cherishing qi and sparing speech.*\n\n○ *Exegesis:*\n*Rare*—as if nonexistent.\nThe utmost Dao, in its profound silence,\ndescends from its wondrous origin without a trace of sound.\nThe Master Blind could hear yet not perceive its voice.\nThe resonant *Qiong* vibrates through the cosmos,\nto illuminate the manifestation as the origin—\nthus it is said: *The Great Sound is rare in voice.*\n\n*The Great Image is formless,*\n*—The one embodying the Great Law’s symbol*\n*is unadorned and without outward appearance.*\n\n○ *Exegesis:*\nThe Dao’s symbol is formless yet manifest.\n*Li Lou* gazes yet sees no shape—\nits hues pervade the void,\nto reveal the paradox of presence within absence—\nhence, *The Great Image is formless.*\n\n*The Way is hidden, nameless.*\n*—The Dao’s depths elude all designation.*\n\n○ *Exegesis:*\nThe utmost Dao, in its mysterious obscurity,\ndefies measurement by form or instrument—\nhow could mere names or speech ever explicate it?\n\nOnly the Dao\nis benevolent in lending and fulfilling.\n*—To fulfill*—to complete.\n\n○ *Exegesis:*\n*Lending*—borrowing.\nThis nameless Dao alone possesses boundless compassion,\nthus stooping to rescue all beings.\nIt borrows their virtuous strength,\nshielding all classes from poison,\nnurturing the Three Realms,\nthrough myriad expedients,\nguiding them toward fulfillment.\n\n*The Dao generates the One,*\n*The One generates the Two,*\n*The Two generates the Three,*\n*The Three generates the Ten Thousand Things.*\n\n*—The Dao generates the One*—the Dao’s first generation is the One.\n*—The One generates the Two*—the One generates yin and yang.\n*—The Two generates the Three*—yin and yang generate the three qi of harmony, purity, and turbidity, partitioning into Heaven, Earth, and Man.\n*—The Three generates the Ten Thousand Things*—Heaven, Earth, and Man together generate the Ten Thousand Things, as Heaven bestows, Earth transforms, and Man nourishes them.\n\n○ *Honor’s Commentary:*\n*The Dao generates the One*—within the void, qi stirs, hence *the Dao generates*.\nBefore primordial qi divides, it is called the One.\n*The One generates the Two*—pure and turbid separate, yin and yang manifest.\n*The Two generates the Three*—the two qi circulate through the Three Realms.\n*The Three generates the Ten Thousand Things*—the round Heaven covers above, the square Earth bears below, and Man governs between—what thing fails to emerge?\n\n*The Ten Thousand Things bear yin while embracing yang,*\n*—The Ten Thousand Things without fail bear yin while turning toward yang,*\n*returning to the heart and seeking the sun.*\n\n○ *Chen’s Commentary:*\nYin and yang are the Dao’s wondrous functions—\n*bear* means external, *embrace* means internal.\n\n#1 *The clashing qi harmonizes.*\n\n「Annotations:\n*The Ten Thousand Things all contain primordial qi*—\nby which they are harmonized and softened.\nIf in the chest there is a *藏* (hidden essence),\nand in the bones there is *髓* (marrow),\nthen within grasses and trees there is *空虚* (emptiness/voidness),\nand the harmonizing qi subtly pervades—\nthus they attain longevity.\n\n○ *Honor’s Commentary:*\nYang qi is hot and solitary—\nit too cannot generate the Ten Thousand Things.\nYin qi is cold and lone—\nit too is insufficient to form shape.\nThrough the *Great Dao* it is communicated,\nand by the *clashing qi* it is harmonized—\nthus the Ten Thousand Things come to be.\n\nWhat men detest,\nare the *孤寡不谷* (lonely, widowed, and unblessed),\nyet kings and lords take them as their titles.\nAnnotations:\n*The lonely, widowed, and unblessed*—\nthis is the name for *谷不祥* (unauspicious blessings),\nyet kings and lords take them as their titles—\ndwelling in humility,\nand following the *voidness*, *emptiness*, and *softness*.\n\n○ *Sparse Commentary:*\nLoneliness and widowhood are matters of misfortune—\nto abhor them is human nature.\nYet kings and nobles employ them to govern themselves,\nproving that nobility stems from humility,\nand exalted status rests on lowly foundations,\nurging those who seek the Dao\nto cultivate a humble and yielding heart.\nThus, some things are diminished when increased—\nAnnotations:\n*If one pulls, it cannot be pushed*—\n*Wenzi* says: *\"To vie is to lack, to yield is to have excess.\nTo yield is to give rise to propriety and righteousness;\nto vie is to spawn violence and chaos.\"*\n—\nand increased when diminished.\n\nAnnotations:\n*Those who heap highness court collapse,\nand those who covet wealth invite ruin.*\n\n○ *Master’s Commentary:*\nHe who diminishes himself is benefited by others.\nHe who benefits himself is diminished by others.\nThus, those who *朝宗* (return to the root) excel in yielding,\nand the humble and weak hold the reins of *德* (virtue).\nFor *孤寡* (lonely/widowed) to be a title—\nis it not fitting?\n\n○ *Master’s Sparse Commentary:*\n*Thus*—reiterating the previous point.\n*Diminished*—meaning self-abasement.\nSpeaking of kings and lords who adopt the titles of *孤寡* (lonely/widowed)\nto humble themselves,\nthe people will joyfully promote them,\nrevering and serving them,\nand the governance thus flourishes.\nOr, when increased yet diminished—\nif kings and nobles indulge their own bodies,\ndwell above and grow arrogant,\nthen those below scatter and the realm collapses.\n*The Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain\"—\nthis is what is meant.\n\n○ *Cheng’s Commentary:*\nHumility and softness,\ndiminishing oneself to aid others—\nthings will naturally gravitate toward him,\nthus attaining the Dao and preserving wholeness.\nArrogance and boasting,\nincreasing oneself to dominate others—\nthings will resist him,\nthus inviting peril and ruin.\nPeril and ruin are *损* (loss),\nwholeness and life are *益* (gain)—\nthe verification of loss and gain\nis entirely manifest,\nthus it is said:\n*to diminish is to gain*,\n*to increase is to lose*.\n\nWhat men are taught—\nAnnotations:\n*That the common people are taught to forsake weakness for strength,\nand softness for rigidity.*\n—\nI too instruct them with righteousness.\nAnnotations:\n*Saying that I teach the common people\nto forsake strength for weakness,\nand rigidity for softness.*\n\n○ *Master’s Commentary:*\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"When a ruler desires to establish teachings to teach the people,\nhe must use my doctrine of softness, weakness, humility, and emptiness to instruct them.\"*\n\n○ *Sparse Commentary:*\nThe vulgar and those of the *儒* (Confucian) teachings also extol humility and softness,\nyet my school’s gate\noriginally reveres stillness and retreat,\nvalues emptiness and forgetfulness—\nthus it differs.\n\nThe *强梁* (unyielding/rigid) do not die naturally—\nAnnotations:\n*The unyielding*—those who do not trust in *玄妙* (mystic profundity),\nrebel against *道德* (Daoist virtue),\ndo not follow the *经教* (scriptures and teachings),\nand rely on power and force.\n*Do not die naturally*—meaning they are cut off by fate,\nslain by arms,\nexecuted by royal law,\nand do not attain death by natural lifespan.\nI shall make them my *教父* (teaching progenitor).\nAnnotations:\n*Progenitor*—the origin.\n\n○ *Master’s Commentary:*\nI have seen the unyielding perish,\nand the soft and weak preserved—\nthus I make this teaching of softness and weakness\nthe progenitor of all teachings.\n\n○ *Sparse Commentary:*\n*Unyielding*—akin to *刚躁* (rigidity and impetuosity).\n*Progenitor*—the origin.\nSpeaking of those who are rigid and unyielding—\nthey must surely die young,\nand cannot rely on fate to die naturally.\nThough the *Laozi* expounds the law in myriad ways,\nand his teachings are not singular,\nhe always says that softness and weakness are good,\nand rigidity and strength are evil—\nthis is the most critical point\nfor those who seek the Dao to grasp first.\n*Progenitor*—origin.\n\n○ *Gu’s Commentary:*\nSpeaking of these rigid and unyielding men—\nsince they do not die naturally,\nI establish this teaching for them,\nexplaining the *无为* (effortless Daoist virtue),\nand making it the foundational progenitor of their instruction.\n\n*The utmost softness in the world,*\n*drives through the utmost firmness in the world.*\nAnnotations:\n*The utmost softness*—water.\n*The utmost firmness*—metal and stone.\nWater can penetrate rigidity,\nand enter strength—\nit flows through all without obstruction.\n\n○ *Sparse Commentary:*\n*Utmost softness*—water.\n*Utmost firmness*—metal.\n*Drives through*—to penetrate.\nSpeaking of water’s utmost softness\nyet ability to break through metal’s firmness—\nit illustrates that the *无为* (effortless Dao)\nin its utmost softness\ncan shatter the burdens of *有为* (worldly striving).\nThus the following passage says:\n*\"The world’s soft and weak,\nnone surpass water—\nin attacking rigidity and strength,\nnone can rival it.\"*\n\n*Without form, it enters the formless.*\nAnnotations:\n*Without form*—the Dao.\nThe Dao has no substance or quality,\nthus it can emerge and enter without obstruction,\ncommuning with the divine,\nand benefiting all living things.\n\n○ *Master’s Commentary:*\n*Without form*—untainted by mundane realms,\nand the heart holds nothing.\n*Without obstruction*—the Dao’s nature is naturally pure and clear,\nits subtle body unified and complete,\nwith no gaps or separations.\nIf one is not disrupted by desires,\nand both heart and realm are still,\nholding nothing at all,\nthen the heart aligns with the Dao,\nand emerges and enters without obstruction.\n\n○ *Sparse Commentary:*\n*Obstruction*—gaps.\nSpeaking of those who are deluded—\nthey see emptiness as having form,\nwhile those who perceive truthfully\nsee form as emptiness—\nthus *without form*.\n*Enter*—harmonious resonance.\n*有为* (worldly striving) is coarse and sparse,\nthus it has gaps.\n*无为* (effortless Dao) is subtle and refined,\nthus it has no obstruction.\nYet in both form and emptiness,\nit can enter the formless principle.\n\n○ *Che’s Commentary:*\nSpeaking of water and wind—\nthey originally have no substance or form,\nmetal and stone, marrow—\nthey too have no gaps or obstructions.\nWind and water can already\npenetrate and traverse,\nand their attacks are relentless.\nThe most wondrous Dao\nis inherently formless—\nkarmic entanglements and coarse habits\nalso lack gaps or openings.\nThe Dao’s profound grace\nhas long since entered and permeated—\nto trace the roots of their bonds,\nto reveal the foundation of their stubbornness,\nto administer the medicine of awakening,\nto open the mechanism of their true nature—\nthis is *without form entering the formless*.」\n\nThe Master thus knew that *effortless Dao* is beneficial.\n\n**Commentary:**\nI have seen the Dao of *effortless action*, yet all things spontaneously transform and complete themselves—thus I know that *effortless Dao* is beneficial to humanity.\n\nThe teaching of *unspeaking*,\n**Commentary:**\nThe Dao’s method is unspeaking; the Sage guides by example.\n\nThe benefit of *effortless action*,\n**Commentary:**\nThe Dao’s method is *effortless*—to cultivate the self benefits the spirit, to govern the realm benefits the people, and it avoids toil and labor.\n\n○ Sun said:\nSoftness can overcome hardness; *nothingness* can dispel *somethingness*—thus it is known that the teaching of *effortless Dao* greatly benefits humanity.\nFew in the world attain it.\n**Commentary:**\nThe world’s ruler—few can approach the Dao’s *effortless* cultivation of self and governance.\n\n○ Cushion:\nWhat is called *unspeaking* is not about sealing the mouth.\nIn principle, it is both *having* and *not having*; in teaching, it is both *speaking* and *silence*.\nBoth *speaking* and *silence*—thus it is called the teaching of *unspeaking*.\nBoth *having* and *not having*—thus it is called the benefit of *effortless action*.\nThe benefit, though not a benefit, is indeed a benefit; the teaching, though not a teaching, is indeed a teaching.\nThis is the exhaustive exploration of principle and nature—rare discourse in the world.\nWorldly teachings seldom reach this, hence it is said that few in the world attain it.\n\n○ Gu said:\nThe Heavenly follows in silent mystery, yet customs shift naturally—thus it is called the teaching of *unspeaking*.\nThe Dao’s method is *effortless*; things and people transform spontaneously—thus it is called the benefit of *effortless action*.\nWhich is closer—*name* or *self*?\n**Commentary:**\nWhen *name* succeeds, the *self* retreats.\n\n○ Yu said:\n*Name* is the guest of *reality*; the world pursues *name* and loses the *self*—thus the question arises: which is closer?\nIt is to abandon merit and *name* and preserve the true.\n\n○ Cushion:\n*Self*—the inner, the real.\n*Name*—the outer, the guest.\n*Na* (who)—who.\nThe world seeks the outer and loses the inner, covets *name* and loses *reality*.\nWhy? Praise and fame are originally for the *self*—if the *self* is for *name*, when the *self* dies, what use is the *name*?\nThe Old Master pitied this inversion, thus he reversed: *Name* and *self*—which is truly yours?\nDo you covet *name* and forget the *self*?\nBy this measure, closeness and distance become clear—thus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Biyí died for his name beneath Chief Yang’s hill.\"*\n\nWhich is more—*self* or *wealth*?\n**Commentary:**\nWealth multiplies and harms the *self*.\n\n○ Yu said:\nPursuing abundance to seek wealth—wealth obtained, the *self* lost—thus the question arises: which is more?\nIt is to cast away jade and shatter pearls to preserve the *self*.\n\n○ Cushion:\nWealth is originally for the *self*—deluded ones lose the *self* for wealth.\nThus the Old Master reproaches: *You abandon the self for wealth—wealth is more beneficial, or losing the self is more beneficial?*\nThus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Zhoulu died for profit atop Mount Shunling.\"*\n\nWhich is the affliction—*gain* or *loss*?\n**Commentary:**\nExcessive desire for gain brings ruin in conduct.\n\n○ Cushion:\nTo covet wealth excessively is to lose oneself; to desire little is to preserve the *self*.\nThen *gain* is the sign of self-ruin, *loss* the proof of self-preservation.\nSelf-ruin is affliction; self-preservation is joy—yet the world reverses this, calling *gain* suitable and *loss* affliction.\nHow mistaken!\nThus the teaching says: *Gain and loss—determine which is the affliction.*\n\nExcessive love brings great expenditure.\n**Commentary:**\nExcessive love of beauty wastes the spirit; excessive love of wealth invites calamity.\nThe more one loves, the less one retains—thus it is called great expenditure.\n\n○ Cushion:\n*Expenditure*—loss.\nThis is its meaning: those who love fame excessively labor their bodies and weary their minds, depleting their spirit and intelligence.\nThis sentence resolves *name*.\n\nHoarding much brings great loss.\n**Commentary:**\nThe living hoard in treasuries; the dead are buried in graves.\nThe living face robbery and plunder; the dead face grave-robbing and coffin desecration.\n\n○ Cushion:\nThose who hoard wealth in treasuries must fear robbers—\nnot only losing their wealth but also endangering their lives.\nTheir ruin is deep and their calamity great.\nThus the *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"An ordinary man without guilt, yet his jade brings him guilt.\"*\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The great scholar Luo recited:\nGreen wheat grows on the hillocks—\nIf not given in life, why hoard pearls in death?\"*\nThus he struck his chin with a hammer and parted his cheeks—\nlest the pearl in his mouth be harmed.\nThis sentence resolves *wealth*.\n\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace.\n**Commentary:**\nThose who know sufficiency cut off desires and avoid gain—\ntheir bodies unshamed, their spirits at ease.\n\n○ Cushion:\nUnderstanding wealth’s falsity, guarding one’s portion, content and serene—\nthus there is no shame.\nThis sentence resolves *wealth*.\n\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\n**Commentary:**\nKnowing when to stop and stopping—\nwealth and gain do not burden the body and mind,\nsounds and colors do not confuse the ears and eyes—\nthus one’s life is never in danger.\n\n○ Cushion:\nHaving awakened to *name*’s falsity, one ceases attachment,\npreserving the *self* and avoiding harm—\nthus there is no peril.\nThe previous passage says:\n*\"Name has already been attained—\nthen one will know when to stop.\"*\nThis sentence concludes *name*.\n\nThus it can endure long.\n**Commentary:**\nIf one knows when to stop, blessings and fortune abide with them.\nCultivating the self, the spirit is unwearied;\ngoverning the realm, the people are undisturbed—\nthus it can endure long.\n\n○ Cushion:\nKnowing when to stop with *name*, knowing sufficiency with *wealth*,\nforgetting *name* and gain—\nthus it can endure long.\nThis sentence summarizes *name*.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* Commentary and Exegesis, Volume Four complete.\n**Note:** This commentary appears in the *Daozang* edition of Chen Xiangu’s *Exegesis of the Dao De Jing*, Volume Lower.\nXiangu was a *Chengyi Lang* of the late Northern Song.\nThus it is known this book emerged from the late Northern Song to early Southern Song,\nnot the Southern Qi’s Gu Xuan’s work, nor a Tang-era compilation.\n\n*The Dao De Jing* Commentary and Exegesis, Volume Five\nBy Wu County Recluse Gu Xuan\n\nGreat completion seems incomplete,\n\n---\n\n**Annotations:**\n「注：」—*Commentary:*\n「○御曰：」—*Master Gu’s Explanation:*\n「○疏：」—*Exegesis:*\n\n---\n\nGreat completion, though seemingly incomplete,\n*—Commentary:* This refers to the sovereign of supreme *Dao* and *virtue*—\nthough appearing incomplete, like a shattered vessel,\nhe extinguishes his *name* and conceals his merit.\nThus his use is unexhausted.\n*—Commentary:* His mind, thus governed, knows no depletion with time.\n*—Master Gu’s Explanation:* Humility brings benefit, so there is no time of want or ruin.\n*—Exegesis:* The one whose deeds are fully accomplished\nyet forgets his accomplishment—\nthough fully accomplished, he seems deficient.\nOnly because he forgets his accomplishment\ndoes his wealth and use never diminish through time.\n\nThus does *Zhuangzi* say:\n*\"Small completion obscures the *Dao*.\"*\n\nNow, completion is not incomplete,\nincompleteness is not completion—\nyet today, completion seems incomplete,\nforgetting incompleteness, forgetting completion.\nThus, unseen is completion as incomplete,\nso it seems incomplete yet is truly complete;\nunseen is incompleteness as completion,\nso great completion seems incomplete.\n\nGreat fullness is like emptiness,\n*—Commentary:* This refers to the sovereign of supreme *Dao* and *virtue*—\nthough full, like emptiness, he does not dare to be proud in his nobility,\nnor extravagant in his riches.\nThus his use is inexhaustible.\n*—Commentary:* His mind, thus governed, knows no exhaustion with time.\n*—Exegesis:* *Chong* is emptiness; *jing* is exhaustion.\nThe one whose *Dao* and *virtue* are fully satisfied\nyet satisfies his fullness—\nthus, though full, he seems empty and void.\nOnly because he forgets fullness, emptiness, and voidness\ndoes his utility never fail.\n\nNow, fullness is not emptiness,\nemptiness is not fullness—\nyet today, fullness seems empty,\nforgetting fullness, forgetting emptiness.\nThus, he is both empty and full,\nfull yet seeming empty.\n\nGreat rectitude is like bending,\n*—Commentary:* Great rectitude refers to the upright practice of *Dao* and law,\nyet bending, like one who does not contend with the vulgar,\nas if yielding and pliable.\n*—Exegesis:* The one of great simplicity and sincerity\ndoes not display his rectitude openly,\nthus blending with the common, bending with things—\nhence, he seems bent.\nThus, true rectitude surpasses petty rectitude.\n\nGreat skill is like clumsiness,\n*—Commentary:* Great skill refers to abundant talents and achievements,\nyet seeming clumsy, he does not dare to display his abilities.\n*—Exegesis:* The artisan who crafts myriad things,\nthe smith who forges all life—\nthough possessing great skill and achievement,\nhe forgets his craft and utility,\nhiding his traces among the common—\nthus, he seems clumsy.\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"He carves and shapes all forms yet does not consider it skillful.\"*\nThus, true skill surpasses petty skill.\n\nGreat eloquence is like inarticulateness.\n*—Commentary:* Great eloquence is unquestionable wisdom;\nyet seeming inarticulate, he has no verbal adornment.\n*—Master Gu’s Explanation:* He does not embellish with trivial tales.\n*—Exegesis:* The one whose profound insight dissects true emptiness,\nmeasuring the utmost mysteries—\nhis speech is beyond speech.\nHe does not conform to the world’s ways.\nSwift and sharp in talent, thus his speech is halting and inarticulate.\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The unsaid eloquence\"*—also, *\"Great eloquence does not speak.\"*\nThus, true eloquence surpasses petty eloquence.\n\nFrenzy overcomes cold,\n*—Commentary:* *Sheng* means extreme.\n\nThe vitality of spring and summer ascends swiftly and fiercely above—when all things reach their utmost flourishing, cold ensues, and cold brings withering and death. Thus, it is said that one should not align with rigid excess.\n\n*Qi* of stillness overcomes heat.\n*—Commentary:* In autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the Yellow Springs—when stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises, and heat is the source of life. ○*Exegesis:* *Liao* (frenzy) is the *yang* (active, bright). Stillness is the *yin* (passive, dark). *Sheng* (overcomes) means extreme. It speaks of the four seasons’ cyclical turn: when *yin* reaches its peak, *yang* emerges; when *yang* reaches its peak, *yin* arises. *Yin*’s emergence causes all things to wither; *yang*’s emergence causes all things to flourish. It analogizes stillness as the foundation of longevity, while frenzy is the root of decay, urging practitioners to abandon frenzy and return to stillness. Again, it explains: descending from the origin to its manifestation, we see frenzy overcoming cold. Returning from the manifestation to the origin, we see stillness overcoming heat. This clarifies how movement and stillness adapt to their proper times.\n\n*—Master Gu’s Explanation:* All things pushed to their limit invert. Movement pushed to its limit becomes stillness; stillness pushed to its limit becomes movement. Observing this, we see that extreme flourishing leads to decline, and extreme decline leads to flourishing—all phenomena in the world follow this pattern. Since it is not the norm to preserve, what should one covet or seek? Therefore, the sage takes nothing, seeks nothing, gains nothing, loses nothing, and in the five great practices of *Dao*, remains naturally pure and still, unaffected by cold or heat. Only then can he be the true master of the world, as it is said: *\"He who clears and stills himself becomes the rightful master of the world.\"*\n\n*—Commentary:* To clear and still oneself is to become the rightful master of the world. *Clearing* and *stillness* ensure enduring rectitude, and holding to the *Dao* means there is no end to its timelessness.\n\n*—Exegesis:* Pure, tranquil, and at ease—one can benefit himself and others, rectify what is wrong and suppress what is perverse. Thus, he becomes the rightful master of the world. This then concludes the exposition of stillness overcoming frenzy, clarifying the distinction between excellence and mediocrity.\n\n*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* It refers to entering deep mountains, practicing purity, and abiding in nature—then one becomes a true person. When the *Dao* prevails in the world, *—Commentary:* Meaning when the ruler of the world follows the *Dao*—\n\nHowever, the warhorses are turned to plowing fields.\n*—Commentary:* \"Plowing\" (粪) here means tilling. It signifies that when arms are not used, warhorses are instead employed to cultivate the fields. For those cultivating the self, it means channeling the vital essence of *yang* to nourish the body.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Explanation:* A ruler who follows the *Dao* governs through *wu-wei*, his actions free from greed, thus avoiding warfare. He dispenses with the use of warhorses, allowing people to till the fields. For those cultivating the self, it means restraining the six senses—like an army—to till the heart with the *Dao*. Hence, Mencius said: *\"All till their fields with dung, but none till their hearts with learning.\"*\n\nWhen the *Dao* prevails in the world,\n*—Commentary:* Meaning when the ruler of the world follows the *Dao*—\n\nthe warhorses are stabled at the outskirts.\n*—Commentary:* Constant warfare keeps warhorses stationed at the borders, never returning. *—Exegesis:* The outskirts are called *jiao* (郊). A ruler without the *Dao* oppresses his people, causing chaos. Greedy for territory, he wages endless wars, forcing military horses to remain permanently beyond the borders. Moreover, those who are reckless and competitive, their hearts devoid of the *Dao*, let their six senses—like an army—gallop through the dusty realm, hence the saying that they \"generate at the outskirts.\"\n\nNo guilt is greater than indulging desire.\n*—Commentary:* Lustful desire. *—Exegesis:* \"Guilt\" (罪) means ruin—being overwhelmed by suffering. When one encounters alluring sights that stir the heart’s craving, it is called \"desirable.\" Yet, if external phenomena can ensnare the mind, they become the root of sin. Thus, the previous passage states: *\"Do not see what is desirable, lest the heart be disturbed.\"*\n\nNo calamity is greater than knowing insufficiency.\n*—Commentary:* Wealth and honor cannot restrain oneself. *—Exegesis:* \"Calamity\" is the deepest form of guilt—when the heart clings to external phenomena, never satisfied, harming others and depleting resources. The guilt grows ever deeper, not just afflicting oneself but extending to three generations.\n\nNo blame is graver than the craving to possess.\n*—Master Yu’s Explanation:* The greatest misfortune is desire; its consequences are deep, hence \"blame.\" *—Exegesis:* \"Blame\" (咎) means censure. The heart’s craving for possession knows no bounds—its censure is unparalleled. Comparing the depths of guilt and calamity, the latter is heavier, while blame is lighter. To fully reveal human nature, both are made explicit.\n\nThus, the sufficiency of *knowing sufficiency*,\n*—Commentary:* Preserving the true root—\nis ever sufficient.\n*—Commentary:* Free from desire. *—Exegesis:* One who adheres to their proper place, without indulging in external pursuits, is always complete, never lacking.\n\nWithout stepping outside,\none knows the world.\n*—Commentary:* The sage does not step outside yet knows the world because they understand others through themselves, and others’ families through their own. *—Exegesis:* \"Outside\" refers to perception, discrimination, and the gates of the senses. The virtuous person, with an empty mind and inner stillness, does not let their thoughts wander into external phenomena, yet knows all under heaven. This is true illumination reflecting the mundane.\n\nWithout peering through the window,\none perceives the *Dao* of Heaven.\n*—Commentary:* The *Dao* of Heaven and humanity are the same; Heaven and man are interconnected, their vital *qi* flowing together. When a ruler is pure and still, Heaven’s *qi* aligns naturally. When a ruler is greedy, Heaven’s *qi* becomes turbulent and impure. All fortune, misfortune, benefit, and harm arise from within oneself. *—Master Yu’s Explanation:* With hands resting and *wu-wei* governance, no decrees are issued beyond the door, yet the *Dao* of Heaven is known. *—Exegesis:* The window (牖) refers to the sensory orifices. The *Dao* of Heaven is the natural principle. In a state of forgetfulness, seated and still, one does not gaze through the sensory gates, yet the true heart shines brightly, revealing the natural *Dao*. This is wisdom illuminating truth.\n\nThe door allows passage in and out—\nfrom true illumination to the mundane.\nThe window, when closed within—\na return to the true source.\n\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\n*—Commentary:* Observing others’ families from afar, others’ bodies from a distance—what is observed grows farther, and what is known grows less. *—Exegesis:* Those who are inverted cannot perceive truth; their minds follow phenomena, ever distant yet never satisfied. Their knowledge is shallow and obscured, lacking discernment.\n\nThus, the sage acts without going,\nyet knows all.\n*—Commentary:* The sage does not ascend to Heaven nor descend into the abyss, yet knows the world through the mind. *—Exegesis:* \"Acts without going\" means the mind does not cling to external phenomena yet knows all things in their true nature. Like a mirror hung in a hall, objects pass before it and are reflected without effort. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The sage does not use the mind to illuminate Heaven.\"*\n\nWithout seeing,\none names.\n*—Commentary:* The ruler cherishes the *Dao*, the people cherish virtue; the ruler values martial prowess, the people value strength. The sage infers the great from the small, the external from the internal. *—Exegesis:* \"Without seeing\" means penetrating the emptiness of all phenomena, for there is nothing visible. \"Names\" refers to rectifying names and classifying all things, leaving traces and manifesting teachings. Without seeing, one diminishes emotional attachments and ornamental excesses daily. *—Master Yu’s Explanation:* Since one does not peer through the window, it is said, \"without seeing.\" When humanity and Heaven are in harmony, one can name the era of great peace.\n\nWithout doing,\none achieves.\n*—Commentary:* If the ruler does nothing, the people have no tasks; households are prosperous, and all things transform naturally. *—Exegesis:* \"Without doing\" means concentrating the spirit in stillness, abandoning all action. \"Achieves\" refers to nurturing all beings and perfecting those who learn—this illustrates stillness in motion.\n\nFor those who study,\ndaily increase.\n*—Commentary:* \"Those who study\" refers to governance, teaching, rites, and music. \"Daily increase\" means emotional desires and ornamental excesses grow ever more.\n\n「○ *Exegesis:* \"For\" means cultivating and embellishing. \"Learn\" refers to mundane studies. It speaks of those who cultivate mundane learning—with sharp emotions and discriminating minds, their desires thus accumulate daily. \"For Dao daily diminishes\" means they act in accordance with the Way of Nature, causing their desires and embellishments to be daily eroded away.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* Those who study accumulate knowledge daily, while those who follow the Dao diminish their deeds. \"Accumulating knowledge\" is the gradual progression of mundane study, while \"diminishing deeds\" is the gateway to enlightenment. Thus, through accumulation, one cultivates virtue, and in forgetting virtue, one attains the Dao itself.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* \"For Dao\" means cultivating the Dao. It speaks of those who cultivate the Dao—with empty minds and tranquil ease, their wisdom and virtue gradually become clear, and their delusions daily dissipate. \"Diminish again, diminish again\" means diminishing desires once more, and again, so as to gradually eliminate them, until reaching the state of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n○ *Exegesis:* Those who study cling to desires, while those who follow the Dao are hindered by the notion of *wuwei*. Though their depths differ, both suffer afflictions. Now, to correct these two extremes, there is the text on diminishing and augmenting. First, diminish and diminish desires; later, diminish and diminish the fixation on *wuwei*. With both extremes dispelled, one attains the non-action of the central path. In non-action, there is nothing that is not done.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* This is the Dao of stillness in motion, of embodying yet applying—thus, there is nothing that is not done. The earlier section states: \"The Dao is ever *wuwei* yet ever *wuwei*.\" To govern the realm, one must always do so without exertion—never burdening the people with laborious tasks.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* \"Govern\" means to transform and guide. It speaks of those who transform and guide all under Heaven, leading them to goodness, always through *wuwei* and non-exertion. Though they respond to things and act accordingly, their minds remain undisturbed—this is stillness within motion. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Who is it that wears himself out, making things his business?\" When one truly has affairs, he is unfit to govern the realm.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* When his mind is not yet empty and forgetful, treating affairs as his business and thus having affairs, this is different from true *wuwei*. True *wuwei* is distinct from having affairs; motion differs from stillness, and stillness contradicts motion. Such a person is unfit to transform and guide the realm.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* The Sage has no mind—never altering his ways, valuing steadfastness, as if without mind. He takes the hearts of the people as his own—following what they find convenient.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* In embodying the Dao, he penetrates and forgets all things, his mind empty and free from thought, like still ashes. Thus, he has no mind. The people are all beings. Though the Sage has no mind, he responds to all stimuli—his responses follow the sensations of things. Hence, he takes the hearts of the people as his own, yet in having no mind, his responses are also without responses.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* \"The Sage’s heart is without heart, yet it responds to all stimuli.\" Thus, those who are already trustworthy, he trusts them; those who are not, he also trusts them. When the people’s virtue is good, the Sage’s virtue is also good. When the people are trustworthy, the Sage trusts them; when they are not, he also trusts them. When the people’s virtue is good, the Sage’s virtue is also good.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* Those who desire goodness and trustworthiness, I follow them accordingly. Those who are not trustworthy, I also teach them goodness and trustworthiness, so that the people are moved by my virtue to become good and trustworthy.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* Trustworthiness means taking delight in hearing the *dharma* and precepts, while lack of trust means not rejoicing in the Dao’s teachings. The Sage, through empty practice and compassion, universally transforms and guides all beings equally, regardless of trust or doubt, so that all may benefit and universally awaken faith. Hence, the *Zhenji* of *Zhenwei* says: \"Trust is the key to gain or loss.\" The *sutra* also states: \"Trust is the pivot of learning the Dao.\"\n\nOne question: If the Sage has no mind, yet responds to all stimuli, and does not respond when there are none, then does he teach those who are trustworthy but not those who are not? Yet the text says that both trustworthy and untrustworthy are taught in the same way, and so too with stimuli and non-stimuli—all are responded to alike.\n\nThe answer: There is both universal and particular response. Like treating illness in the *Xuan Du* Palace of Jade Clarity, yet always saving the Three Realms—this is universal response. As for the barbarians who, upon sensing the *Zhi* of Purple Qi, receive the *Dao* from *Yin* the True Person—this is particular response.\n\nIf the response is particular, it awaits particular stimuli; if universal, it is ever-present with boundless compassion. Hence the *sutra* says: *\"Ever saving all beings without abandoning any.\"*\n\n**Explication:**\nIt means that when a person is trustworthy, trust is one; when trust is one, it trusts the person. If a person does not trust the One, the One arises from the person, so the Dao ever attains its trust.\n\nThe Sage moves through the world with constant reverence—\n*Note:* The Sage, moving through the world, is ever reverent and fearful, never daring to indulge in arrogance or excess from wealth and honor.\n\n**Commentary:** *Reverence* (*chùchù*)—the form of ceaseless fear—speaks of having no mind to respond to stimuli.\n\nThe Sage, dwelling in the world, ever spreads great compassion, protecting and saving all beings, fearing they may perish or drown. Thus, he moves with constant reverence and fear.\n\nHe muddles the hearts of the people—\n*Note:* The Sage muddles the hearts of the common folk, as if making them dull and unknowing.\n\n**Commentary:** *Muddled* (*húntūn*)—without distinction. It speaks of how ordinary people, ensnared by emotions and entangled in the world, foolishly grasp at gain and loss. The Sage desires to muddle their hearts, leaving them without distinction, and this is the meaning of his constant fear and reverence.\n\nAll the people focus their ears and eyes—\n*Note:* *Focus* (*zhù*)—to use.\n\nAll the people use their ears and eyes as the Sage’s eyes and ears.\n\n**Commentary:** The *River Above* text reads *zhù* (focus), while other versions read *yín* (indulgence). *Indulgence* means to be stained and entangled; those who are deluded and inverted, lost in the world, give free rein to their ears and eyes, clinging to sounds and colors. Later, they drift adrift in endless wandering, accumulating faults day by day. The Sage pities their suffering, so he reveals their affliction.\n\nAmong the six senses, two are highlighted to show these two afflictions are the deepest.\nThus the *Sutra of Western Ascension* says: *\"Ears and eyes, sounds and colors—these are the children’s faults.\"* Yet by mentioning one sense, all senses are implied, for completeness’ sake.\n\nThe Sage treats them all like infants—\n*Note:* The Sage loves and cares for the people as if they were newborn children, nurturing them without expecting repayment.\n\n**Commentary:** Ordinary beings indulge their ears and eyes, drowning in the river of desire. The Sage, with constant fear and compassion, acts like one who pities infants, grieving their ignorance.\n\nThey are born and they die.\n*Note:* *Born*—when emotions arise from within, the spirit is settled, the soul is still, hence *born*. *Die*—when emotions enter the chest, the spirit is confused and agitated, hence *death*.\n\n**Commentary:** *Born*—transcending the Three Realms, free from birth and death.\n*Die*—sinking into the Three Paths, drowning in birth and death. If one understands the meaning of birth and death, it is from non-being to being, releasing *birth* as *birth*; from being back to non-being, releasing *extinction* as *death*.\n\nThere are thirteen kinds of those who are born, and thirteen kinds of those who die.\n*Note:* It speaks of the thirteen types of birth and death—namely, the nine orifices and four passages.\n\nIn their birth: the eyes do not gaze wantonly, the ears do not listen wantonly, the nose does not sniff wantonly, the mouth does not speak wantonly, the tongue does not taste wantonly, the hands do not grasp wantonly, the feet do not walk wantonly, the vital essence is not expended wantonly. In their death, it is the opposite.\n\n**Commentary:** *Kinds* (*tú*)—types. The nine orifices and four passages belong to both sages and ordinary beings. The Sage forgets them, thus transcending the Three Realms. Ordinary beings cling to them, thus entering the Six Paths. Entering the Six Paths is the kind of death; transcending the Three Realms is the kind of birth.\n\nA person’s life moves toward thirteen kinds of death.\n*Note:* When a person seeks life through action, it reverses into thirteen kinds of death.\n\n**Commentary:** When a person’s life is directed toward death, it is because they cling to these thirteen (senses), becoming entangled in the world before them.\n\nWhy is this so?\n*Note:* Asking why one moves toward death through action.\n\n**Commentary:** A rhetorical question, answered below.\n\nBecause their attachment to life is excessive.\n*Note:* The reason one moves toward death through action is that their pursuit of life is too heavy, contrary to the Dao and Heaven, acting recklessly and losing measure.\n\n**Commentary:** It speaks of how people cannot embody the Dao and forget life, instead clinging to life as real, accumulating wealth and resources, overindulging in life’s concerns, thus moving toward death. This sentence answers the prior question.\n\nIndeed, it is heard that those who skillfully nurture life—\n*Note:* *Nurture* (*shè*)—to guard, to nourish.\n\n**Commentary:** *Indeed*—not a direct answer, akin to *\"I have heard.\"* *Nurture*—to guard, to nourish. It speaks of how those who skillfully guard and nourish life are simple and unadorned, untouched by the world. The excellence of their guardianship is shown below.\n\nWhen walking on land, they avoid rhinoceroses and tigers—\n*Note:* Naturally avoiding harm, which does not reach them.\n\n**Commentary:** *Land*—flat ground. *Rhinoceros*—a poisonous beast with one horn, resembling a wild ox, green in color. It speaks of how those who nurture life skillfully are not harmed by poisonous beasts. Internally, it means they remain calm and undisturbed by afflictions in daily life.\n\nEntering battle, they are unharmed by armor and weapons—\n*Note:* They do not love war or killing.\n\n**Commentary:** It speaks of how those who nurture life do not enter battlefields and are not harmed by weapons. Internally, even if they enter the world, they are not injured by desires.\n\nRhinoceroses have no place to strike with their horns, tigers no place to place their claws, weapons no place to lodge their blades—\n*Note:* Those who nurture life skillfully are not injured by rhinoceroses or tigers, nor harmed by weapons.\n\n**Commentary:** Other texts say *zhù* (stationary). *Stationary*—to stand; *place*—to settle. Rhinoceroses, encountering objects, charge; this allegorizes the foolish. Tigers are fierce and violent; this allegorizes greed. Weapons are sharp and can harm people; this allegorizes gluttony. It speaks of how those who nurture life skillfully embody true emptiness, so even amid the world, they are unharmed by the Three Poisons.\n\nWhy is this so?\n\n*—Asking why tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons do not harm them.*\n\nFor they dwell in the realm of no-death.\n\n*—Because they do not violate the thirteen forbidden grounds of death, the numinous protects them, and these creatures dare not harm them.*\n\n*—The Way flows naturally without partiality; they do not regard death as death, so things cannot harm their life—thus, the realm of no-death.*\n\n*—Those who perceive form as form regard the body as the ground of death. But those who practice life-nurturing skillfully forget bodily form—when form is forgotten, there is no ground for death. Without the ground of death, how could the Three Poisons take hold?*\n\n*—The Sage embraces spirit and unity, regulates qi and stabilizes the fetal breath, thus these creatures cannot harm them. The Dao dwells in the heart, and true qi abides—there is no ground for execution.*\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\nVirtue nurtures them,\nForm shapes them,\nMomentum completes them.\n\n*—The Dao generates all things. Virtue (unity) spreads qi and nurtures them.*\n\n*—The Supreme Dao is boundless and mysterious, generating all things; supreme virtue is compassionate and sustains all life—thus, \"the Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures.\"*\n\n*—It endows them with form and momentum to complete them.*\n\n*—Thus all things reverence the Dao and honor virtue.*\n\n*—All things arise from the Dao and virtue; hence, they are revered.*\n\n*—The Dao and virtue are honored not by titles but by their natural operation.*\n\n*—The Dao’s honor and virtue’s nobility require no artificial elevation—they are naturally so.*\n\nThus the Dao:\nGives birth to them,\nNurtures them,\nLengthens them,\nCultivates them,\nPerfects them,\nMatures them,\nSustains them,\nCovers them.\n\n*—The Dao’s work for all things is not merely to give birth but to lengthen, nurture, perfect, mature, sustain, and cover—fulfilling their nature and life.*\n\n*—This mirrors the ruler’s governance of state and self.*\n\n*—The text repeats earlier phrases to introduce what follows. The Dao is mentioned without virtue because virtue does not differ from the Dao, though the text is concise for brevity.*\n\nAs the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"The Dao and virtue are indistinct and mysteriously unified.\"*\n\nLengthening refers to fostering their virtuous sprouts.\nCultivating refers to advancing their deeds.\nPerfecting and maturing refers to refining their hearts with supreme teachings, so their Dao is fulfilled and their virtue perfected—this echoes prior language to lead into the next passage.\nSustaining and covering: sustaining refers to rewarding their fruits; covering refers to sheltering with boundless compassion.\n\nThe four pairs above clarify the virtue of benefiting all things; the three below clarify the Dao’s self-effacing function.\n\nGiving birth yet not possessing,\nActing yet not relying,\nLengthening yet not controlling—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\n*—The Dao’s operation is an unfathomable benevolence, invisible yet profound.*\n\n*—This refers to the passage above, introducing what follows. \"Mysterious\" denotes depth; \"virtue\" signifies protective fulfillment. It points to those who embody the Dao, benefiting others while forgetting their own deeds, guiding people with the law—truly Mysterious Virtue.*\n\n*—The Dao is the apex of yang, yang being heaven. Heaven moves, thus generating all things. Virtue is the apex of yin, yin being earth; earth encompasses, thus nurturing all things. Receiving qi is birth; nurturing form is sustenance—the forms and momentum of all things. Perfecting refers to completing them through their deeds and momentum, forming human shape.*\n\n*—The Dao endows all beings with the four seasonal rhythms, completing all things—this explanation precedes.*\n\nAt the origin of all things lies the Dao,\nWhich becomes the mother of all under heaven.\n\n*—The origin is the subtle black of primordial harmony; this mysterious qi generates all things with nourishing virtue, thus it can be the mother of all under heaven.*\n\n*—The Dao is the primordial mother; this is its description. The mysterious Dao is the source of great wisdom, transcending names and forms, beyond all colored appearances. All things under heaven arise from it.*\n\n---\n\nNow the text speaks of those who boldly proclaim,\nSeeking to make the Wayfarer* recognize the root and know the origin,\nThus the Classic says: *\"All things originate from the Dao.\"*\n\nWhen it says *\"the mother of all under heaven,\"*\nIt means the Dao descends from its origin,\nGuiding and nurturing the teeming multitude,\nCultivating and fostering them,\nLike a mother’s love for her child,\nHence the Upper Classic says: *\"The Dao that bears a name is the mother of all things.\"*\n\n*—Cai says: \"Origin\" is the root.*\nAll beings are sunk in the Five Desires,*\nIgnorant of their root and origin,\nDriven by the current, chasing after trivial ends,\nFloating through life and death.\nThus the Venerable Lord Laozi raises the root to show them,\nIlluminating that the world possesses the Clear and Void Qi as Virtue and Power,\nAs your root and origin.\nMoreover, the origin has no predecessor,\nThe mother has merit,\nTaking the Dao’s role in generating life,\nThus it is called *\"origin.\"*\nThe nurturing merit is then called *\"mother.\"*\n\nHaving known its mother,\nOne must also know its child.\n*—The child is Unity.*\nHaving known the Dao,\nOne must also know Unity.\n\n*—Yu says: When all things have received the Clear Qi’s nurturing virtue,*\nAnd know their own bodies,\nThat is the Clear Qi’s child.\n\n*—Cui says: The root can generate form,*\nThe mother can generate life.\nHaving known that the Dao is my mother,\nI know that I am the Dao’s child,\nBorn from the Dao.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"The Void and Natural is the true parent.\"*\nHaving known its child,\nOne must again safeguard its mother,\n*—Safeguarding Unity,*\nOne must again safeguard the Dao,\nReturning to Non-Action.*\n\n*—Cai says: Having known that I am the Dao’s child,*\nAnd thus obtain life,\nI must safeguard the Clear and Tranquil Non-Action,\nReturning to its mother,\nThus merging with the Dao.\nThe body will not perish.\n*—It will not be endangered.*\n\n*—Yu says: Having known that the body is the Clear Qi’s child,*\nOne must safeguard this Clear and Harmonious Qi,\nPreventing its dispersion,\nThen the body will not perish,\nAnd its danger will not manifest.\n\n*—Cui says: Having known that I am the Dao’s child,*\nI must return and safeguard its mother.\nBut if one can return to the root and safeguard the mother,\nSafeguarding the Dao to attain Truth,\nThough the forms may appear or vanish,\nThe origin remains undangerous and unendangered.\nWhy so?\nThe Dao can generate life,\nThe Dao is the origin.\nLife arises from the Dao,\nLife is the trivial end.\nYet the trivial end can encompass the origin,\nThus one must return to its mother.\nThe mother can generate the child,\nThus one must safeguard its mother.\nSafeguarding the mother brings enduring vision and longevity,\nReturning to the root ensures the body’s safety,\nHence the exhortation.\n\nThe *Xisheng Classic* says: *\"Constantly nurturing the mother, one can endure long.\"*\n\nClose the *Fu* (eyes),\n*—Preventing the eyes from viewing indiscriminately.*\nShut the *Men* (mouth),\n*—Preventing the mouth from speaking indiscriminately.*\n*—Cui says: Though the text above exhorts safeguarding the mother,*\nIt has not yet shown the method of cultivation and safeguarding,\nThus the following passage fully displays the means of safeguarding and returning,\nIncluding closing and shutting.*\n\n*Fu* is the mouth,\n*—Yet among the Six Roots,*\nThe *Fu* is singled out,\nRevealing that the Yang River* is both the Three Activities and the Six Roots,\nAnd its sins are manifold.\n*Men* refers to the Five Gates.\nClosing the Five Gates,\n*—Preventing contamination by dustly realms.*\nThe previous mention of *Fu* was a distinction among the roots,\nNow *Men* is the comprehensive root.\n\nBut the meaning of closing and shutting has two aspects:\nOne is to sever desires and endure colors,\nTo take refuge in mountains and forests,\nOr to turn away and shut the gates,\n*—Not seeing what is desirable.*\nTwo is to understand that the Six Dusts are illusory and insubstantial,\nThe roots are not true,\nWithin, there is no heart capable of contamination,\nWithout, there are no desirable realms.\nThus, though one’s eyes see and ears hear to their utmost,\nOne remains ever in the Dao’s realm,\nNot straying from the True,\nHow could one say that plugging ears and closing eyes is closing and shutting?\nNo, it is not so—\nThis is the wondrous essence of closing and shutting.\n\nAll one’s life, one is not weary.\n*—When humans close their eyes to prevent indiscriminate viewing,*\nAnd shut their mouths to prevent indiscriminate speaking,\nThey will not toil all their lives.*\n\n*—Cui says: \"Weary\" means labor and suffering.*\nThe Dao has many paths,\nThe gates are not singular;\nSome still the heart to avoid dustly realms,\nSome dwell in realms to grasp the True Source,\nDeep and shallow entanglements,\nIndeed manifold.\n\nThus the *Xisheng Classic* says: *\"Action brings calamity, and the self is burdened—*\nThis is the utmost toil and suffering.\"\nBut if one follows the earlier closing and shutting,\nDwelling in realms while attaining the True,\nThe heart’s nature is at ease and broad,\nFree from labor and fatigue,\nThus one can live out the years,\nAnd not weary all their lives.\n\nOpen the *Fu* (eyes),\n*—To indulge in the Five Desires’ gates,*\nAnd aid the Six Dusts’ affairs,\n*—The heart and spirit grow inwardly exhausted,*\nThe ears and eyes are outwardly strained,\nAll one’s life in labor and fatigue.*\n\nAll one’s life, one is not saved.\n*—Calamity is accomplished.*\n\n*—Cui says: When the foolish act thus,*\nThey open the eyes and ears,\nAssisting in sound and color,\nAll their lives entangled,\nPerishing in lust,\nEven the Great Sage and Great Compassionate\nCould not save them from this fate.*\n\nSeeing small is called *Ming* (clear).\n*—When sprouts are yet unseen and calamity not yet revealed,*\nThat is the small and manifest,\nOnly seeing is called *Ming* (clear).*\n\n*—Yu says: When humans, at the onset of affairs,*\nSee the small and change their conduct,\nThis can be called *Ming* (clear).*\n\n*—Cui says: \"Seeing\" is observation and illumination,*\n\"Small\" is the name for the minute and subtle.\nThe utmost subtle principle,\nSpeaking that humans, if they but observe the subtle realm,\nWill daily increase in wisdom and clarity,\nHence the Upper Classic says: *\"Observe its subtlety.\"*\nSafeguarding softness brings daily strength.\n*—Cui says: Having seen the small,*\nWisdom and clarity increase,\nAnd one can apply the Dao,\nKnowing softness as well,\nThus one’s virtue and deeds grow daily stronger.\nAt the start of learning,\nThere is steadiness and benefit,\nThere is practice and understanding,\nSeeing the small is the gate to benefit and steadiness,\nApplying softness is the extension of practice and understanding.\nThus among the Six Perfections,\nThere is practice and understanding,\nThe first five are practice,\nThe last is understanding,\nUnderstanding is benefit and emptiness,\nPractice encompasses both emptiness and substance,\nUsing substance to guide emptiness,\nUsing emptiness to aid substance,\nDesiring to clarify the ability of guidance and aid,\nThus it is said: \"Apply softness, see the small.\"*\n\n「Use its light—\n*—Cui says: To deploy its luminous gaze outward,*\nAnd observe the world’s advantages and harms.\nThen return to its clarity—\n*—Cui says: To withdraw its light inward,*\nLest the spirit be dissipated outward.\n○ *Commentary:* Light illuminates the external.\nYet once deployed, it is forgotten—\nConcealing brilliance, obscuring traces,\nReturning clarity to the dim.\nThus it is said: *Then return to its clarity.*\nThe following passage states: *Illuminating without dazzling.*\n*Zhuangzi* says: *The brilliance of doubt is what the Sage seeks to avoid.*\nWithout inviting calamity upon oneself—\n*—Cui says: To inwardly preserve the spirit,*\nLest it be lost or harmed.\nThis is called *habitual cultivation.*\n*—Yu says:* \"遗\" (*herni*—*to invite*) means *to share with* or *to give to*.\nTo restore and guard the inner clarity,\nThen no calamity is shared with the body—\nThus it is called *secretly applying the Dao of True Constancy.*\n○ *Commentary:* Once deployed and forgotten,\nThe round virtue is fully practiced,\nAll burdens exhausted,\nNo lingering calamity remains.\nIt is also said: *No calamity is shared with the body,*\nAnd all burdens are fully exhausted.\nWhen deeds are complete,\nAll burdens are exhausted—\nThe transmission of the scripture and the master’s teaching\nBelongs to this person,\nThus one may call him *inheriting the Dao of Constancy,*\nAnd *continuing the True Teaching.*\n\n*—If I were to possess even a modicum of knowledge,*\nI would walk the Great Dao—\n*—Cui says:* \"介\" (*jie*—*modicum*) means *great*.\nLaozi laments that rulers do not walk the Great Dao,\nThus he sets forth: *If I were to possess even a modicum of knowledge,*\nI would then walk the Great Dao,\nPersonally embodying the transformation of *Wuwei*.\n○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* I have always, day and night,\nGuarded the One within my body.\n○ *Wang Bi and Luoshimo* say#1: \"介\" (*jie*—*modicum*) means *small*—\nIf I had even a small measure of knowledge,\nI would then walk the Great Dao.\n\n*—Yet I alone fear what is applied.*\n*—Cui says:* \"唯\" (*wei*—*alone*) means *only*.\nOnly fearing what is applied,\nLest the Dao’s intent be lost—\nDesiring to reward the good, yet fearing false goodness arises,\nDesiring to trust the loyal, yet fearing deceitful loyalty emerges.\n○ *Yu says:* The Master Laozi speaks:\nIf I were to be upright and boast of my knowledge,\nDesiring to walk the Great Dao,\nYet it does not align with the Dao,\nThus only what is applied is to be feared.\n○ *Commentary:* \"使我\" (*shǐ wǒ*—*If I*) is a hypothetical phrase.\nKnowledge is discrimination.\n\"介然\" (*jièrán*—*modicum*) is minute.\nThe Great Dao is most level and easy,\nYet if I were to arise with even a modicum of discrimination,\nTo knowingly walk the Dao,\nThis is deeply unfit.\nWhy?\nThe Ultimate Dao is empty and boundless,\nIts mysteries surpass all discrimination—\nNeither true nor false,\nNeither real nor unreal,\nTrue and false share the same nature,\nDeath and life are the same offering.\nEntering the Nine Abysses without confusion,\nExiting the Three Realms without distinction,\nTreading dangers yet ever secure,\nConfronting great calamities without fear.\nNow, to arise with discrimination,\nTo deviate from the Ultimate Dao—\nAll actions lead to the path of death,\nThus they are to be feared.\n\nThe Great Dao is most level and easy,\nYet people prefer crooked paths.\n*—Cui says:* \"径\" (*jing*—*crooked paths*) means *devious ways*,\nWhile the Dao is most level and easy,\nYet people prefer to follow devious paths.\n○ *Commentary:* \"夷\" (*yi*—*level*) is upright and true.\n\"径\" (*jing*—*devious*) is the crooked way.\nThe utmost principle is equal and level,\nWithout distinction or discrimination,\nYet those who are inverted\nTurn from the true to the devious,\nThus the Great Dao is neglected,\nAnd petty achievements flourish.\n\n*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of people’s love of deceit and falsehood,\nAnd their reckless pursuit of shortcuts.\n\n*—Morning is most refined,*\n*—Cui says:* High palaces and pavilions,\nElaborate halls and chambers.\n○ *Commentary:* The ruler without Dao\nLoves devious paths,\nDoes not uphold simplicity,\nOnly values luxury and excess—\nThen he demolishes his old halls,\nRaises new palaces,\nCarves pillars and beams,\nExhausts all ornate beauty.\n\n*—Fields are most overgrown,*\n*—Cui says:* Agriculture neglected,\nUnplowed and uncultivated,\nWasting the seasons.\n○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of people not refining their inner nature,\nBut instead adorning themselves morning and evening,\nThus generating illness—\nTheir hearts become wild and unclean.\n○ *Commentary:* With taxes and labor burdens heavy,\nFarmers abandon their work—\nThe eastern slopes lie fallow,\nThe southern fields overgrown with weeds.\n\n*—Granaries are most empty,*\n*—Cui says:* The five grains are harmed,\nThe state has no reserves.\n○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of not guarding the inner constancy,\nThus the five *zang* organs are depleted—\nHence it says *empty*.\n○ *Commentary:* Harvests decline,\nThe state has no wealth—\nThe loom and spindle lie idle,\nGranaries are left bare.\n\n*—Wearing embroidered silks,*\n*—Cui says:* Loving false adornment,\nValuing external splendor.\n*—And carrying sharp blades,*\n*—Cui says:* Upholding rigidity,\nMartial and extravagant.\n○ *Yu says:* Virtue is not cultivated,\nYet martial strength is prized.\n○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of loving fine garments,\nRejecting falsehood for truth—\nCarrying sharp blades,\nRelying on weapons for defense,\nThus falling ill from the influence of malevolent spirits.\n\n*—Sated with drink and food.*\n*—Cui says:* Excessive desires,\nNever knowing contentment.\n○ *Commentary:* Brocade and embroidery adorn the body,\nGanjiang and Moye guard the life,\nSweet wine and rich meats delight the palate—\nYet they do not exalt the superior virtue,\nNor care for the common people.\nAlas, the gluttonous and greedy!\nThey reach this extreme.\n\n*—Wealth and goods are in excess,*\nThis is called *plundering and boasting.*\n*—Cui says:* The people lack sufficient means,\nYet the ruler has excess—\nThis is due to robbing and plundering\nFor his adornments and extravagance,\nHolding displays to boast before others,\nUnknowing that death and ruin will follow,\nAnd his kin will perish with him.\n\n*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of loving sweet and fatty foods\nTo nourish the body,\nYet abandoning the inner constancy—\nThus a hundred ailments arise,\nAnd wealth is amassed only for the sake of death and mourning.\n\n*—This is not the Dao!*»\n*—Cui says:* If a ruler acts thus,\nHis death is not in accordance with the Dao.\n\n「Again, it says *\"Also, this is not the Dao!\"*—\nA lamenting and grieving expression.\n\n*—Yu says:* To indulge in what is known,\nEvery action brings ruin—\nActing like thieves and robbers,\nYet still boasting and vaunting,\nBoasting and thievery are not the Dao,\nOnly inviting sighs of lamentation.\n\n*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It means that people do not practice *non-action* (無爲),\nBut only think of fine clothing and delicious food,\nAs if they could become thieves and robbers,\nYet they cannot stop sickness or avert death—\nThus, it is not the Dao.\n\n*—Commentary:* Hoarding wealth and amassing riches,\nLike thieves and bandits,\nBoth storing and accumulating,\nYet boasting and showing off,\nContrary to reason and against virtue—\nThis is called *\"not the Dao.\"*\n\n*—The one who walks the Dao with a resolute heart*\nCannot be praised—\nHis carriage is stripped bare,\nNo virtuous deeds remain.\nHis fields lie overgrown,\nHis mind neglected.\nHis granaries stand empty,\nNo moral cultivation.\nHe adorns himself with embroidered finery,\nDelights in ornate speech.\nHe wears a sharp blade,\nHis greed as keen as steel.\nHe feasts on food,\nYet indulges in its flavors.\nWealth and goods abound,\nYet he does not disperse them.\nGoodly foundations cannot be uprooted—\n*—Annotation:* *Jian* (建) means to establish.\nThose who establish themselves and their realm with the Dao\nCannot be pulled away or overturned.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Jian* (建) means to establish.\n*Ba* (拔) means to topple.\nOne who establishes the Dao-heart\nHas firm resolve,\nReaching the Dao-field,\nUnshakable and unyielding.\n\n*—Wang and Lu say:* A carriage is made from many materials,\nOnly then is it called a carriage.\nA ruler is formed by the people bearing him,\nOnly then is he called a ruler.\nYet without materials,\nHow can a carriage exist?\nWithout people,\nHow can a ruler stand tall?\nThus, one who loves carriages\nMust value the materials,\nAnd one who treasures the Dao-root\nMust guard the people.\n\n*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* The Dao is truly nameless, embracing *Oneness* (抱一),\nGuarding within, not seeking without—\nThus, it is said to have *\"no praise\"*.\n*—The one who holds fast to the Dao*\nCannot be separated—\n*—Annotation:* Those who hold fast to the Dao with their spirit,\nForever cannot be pulled away or freed.」\n\nThis verse follows upon the resolve of the Dao-heart,\nAnd begins the practice of the Dao-body.\n*—The one who holds fast to the Dao*\nGains the eternal *Oneness*—\nNever deviating or failing.\n\n*—Sacrifices of descendants do not cease.*\n*—Annotation:* The *Master* says: *[The one who] holds fast to the Dao-root through virtue and power,*\nWhose merit extends to posterity,\nLoving the sweet osmanthus grove—\nHow much more so for their descendants?\n*—The ruler’s merit lies in the Dao,*\nThe ancestor’s virtue lies in the Dao,\nThus, the rise of Zhou began with Hou Ji,\nAnd was completed by Wen and Wu.\n*—Zhou’s sacrifices*\nHonor Hou Ji in the *Altar of Heaven* (郊祀),\nAnd worship Wen Wang in the ancestral temple (宗祀),\nSo even when divination foretold thirty generations of succession,\nAnd seven hundred years of rule,\nWhen the main stream of the ancestral temple was destroyed and overflowed outward,\n*—The sacrifices to Hou Ji and Wen Wang did not cease.*\n\n*—Practicing the Dao in oneself,*\nOne’s virtue becomes true;\n*—Annotation:* *[The one who] practices the Dao in oneself,*\nNurtures *qi* and tends the spirit,\nExtending life and prolonging years—\n*—Thus, their virtue is real.*\n*—Annotation:* Through prior learning and practice,\nOne refines oneself until\n*—The body and mind harmonize,*\n*—And virtue and power are truly realized.*\n\n*—Practicing the Dao in the family,*\nOne’s virtue becomes abundant;\n*—Annotation:* *[The one who] practices the Dao in the family,*\n*—Where the father is kind and the son filial,*\n*—Where brothers are friendly and younger siblings obedient,*\n*—Where the husband is trustworthy and the wife chaste,*\n*—Thus, their virtue brings lasting blessings,*\n*—Extending to future generations.*\n\n*—Practicing the Dao in the

state,*\n*—Then the ruler is trustworthy and the ministers loyal,*\n*—Ren and righteousness arise naturally,*\n*—Rites and music flourish spontaneously,*\n*—Governance is fair and without

internal or external worries,*\n*—Are they not the virtuous and sagely rulers,*\n*—Whose deeds are rich and ample?*\n\n*—Practicing the Dao in the world,*\nOne’s virtue becomes universal.\n*—Annotation:* The sovereign who practices the Dao in the world,\n*—Acts without words and transforms without teaching,*\n*—The people respond to the ruler as shadows follow form,*\n*—Trustful as echoes follow sound,*\n*—Thus, their virtue is boundless and far-reaching.*\n*—Annotation:* The *Nine-at-the-Top* sovereign (九五之君),\n*—Rules by the Dao,*\n*—Upright and silent, profound and taciturn,*\n*—Bringing great peace to the world,*\n*—Thus, all nations come to pay homage,*\n*—And all quarters submit in allegiance,*\n*—Their transformation reaches

tortoise-shell guide.*\n*—Annotation:* The *Master* says: *I know of the world’s rise and fall,*\n*—Of those who practice the Dao flourishing,*\n*—And those who abandon the Dao perishing,*\n*—By observing this way.*\n\n*—Annotation:* Yao and Shun’s ascension to peace was because of the Dao.\n*—Jie and Zhou’s* descent into licentiousness was because of the lack of the Dao.\n*—Thus, it is

be discerned.*\n\n*—Thus, the Master* sets forth the analogy:\n*—How do I know the world’s success and failure?*\n*—Only by this criterion,*\n*—It suffices as a mirror and tortoise-shell

myriad things,\nyet never contradicting the unsaid.\nThis verse reveals the cooling of *verbal action*.\n\nTo know harmony is to know the constant.\n*—Annotation:* If one knows the gentle, yielding *qi* as beneficial,\nthen they grasp the Dao’s enduring truth.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* To remain like the babe,\nsteadfast in softness and harmony—\nthis is the practice of knowing the constant.\n*—Exegesis:* To recognize this speechless speech,\nthis pure and harmonious principle,\nis to embody the eternal Dao.\n\nTo know the constant is to be enlightened.\n*—Annotation:* If one practices the Dao’s enduring truth,\nthen daily they illuminate the profound mysteries.\n*—Exegesis:* To know the eternal Dao\nis to shine with wisdom’s radiance.\n\nTo nurture life is auspicious.\n*—Annotation:* *Auspicious* means *growth*.\nThe babe’s life grows naturally, day by day.\n*—Exegesis:* *Auspicious* means *abundance*.\nThose deluded by worldly desires,\nunaware of birth and non-birth,\nindulge in worldly gains,\nthickening their vital *qi*—\nthus their afflictions and obstructions multiply daily.\n\nThe heart directs *qi*, making it strong.\n*—Annotation:* If the heart remains focused on harmony and softness,\nthen *qi* solidifies within, and the form grows supple.\nBut if the heart is driven by delusion,\nharmonizing *qi* departs,\nand the body grows rigid and strong.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* If the heart harbors distinctions,\n*qi* loses its differentiation—\nto force the heart to command *qi*\nis to become a tyrant of strength.\n*—Exegesis:* The heart is the spirit;\n*qi* is the body.\nWorldly passions invert truth,\nand delusion arises from contact.\nHow could they know all things are empty,\nthe body but an illusion?\nYet they compel the spirit to dominate the form,\ndriving it in toil—\nthus the karmic bonds of birth and death grow ever stronger.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they wither—\nthis is called *not the Dao*.\n*—Annotation:* When all things peak, they decay and age,\nand decay brings no attainment of the Dao.\n*—Exegesis:* The flourishing must decline;\nwhen things reach their height, they age—\nthus, to nurture life and strengthen *qi*\nproves the impermanence of existence.\nSince impermanence is true,\nthis cannot be the true Dao.\n\nNot attaining the Dao brings early decline.\n*—Annotation:* Those who fail to attain the Dao decline early.\n*Early decline* means *death*.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* All things, when at their peak, decay—\nthus the warning: *\"Pride in strength is unaligned with the Dao,\nand must be halted.\"*\n*Halting* means *cessation*.\n*—Exegesis:* *Halting* means *cessation*.\n\nIf it is not the true Dao, one must cease and not pursue it.\n\n---\n\n**Daoist Canon: Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao/Way* (卷之五 complete)**\n\n#1: Original reads *\"亡\"* (wáng), should be *\"云\"* (yún).\n#2: Original reads *\"伐\"* (fá), should

action over speech.\n*—Exegesis:* Those who grasp the Dao, comprehend its subtle principles—\nthey know that reason transcends words,\nthus they do not speak.\n\nHence, *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Dao cannot be questioned,\nnor can questions be answered—\nthis is called *wuwei* (non-action).\"*\n*—Rhythmic Explanation:* Meaning the Dao is beyond articulation.\n\nThose who speak do not know.\n*—Annotation:* A tongue outpaces four horses—\nmany words bring many calamities.\n*—Exegesis:* Those who cling to verbal definitions\nand seek reason in words alone\ncannot fathom the Dao’s transcendence of speech and symbols,\nthus they do not know.\n\nHence, *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"If one questions the Dao and receives an answer,\nthey do not know the Dao.\"*\n*—Rhythmic Explanation:* Meaning the speaker does not grasp its singularity.\n\nThe Dao is known by the Yellow Emperor.\n\n*—Annotation:* He who blocks the *兑* (duì, \"joy\" or \"mouth\"),\nand shuts his gates,\n*—Annotation:* Those who block and seal\ndesire to cut off its source.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* Those who attain enlightenment\nhave no attachment to the Dao,\nnor do they cling to words,\nthus it is said: *\"He who blocks the *兑*.\"*\nSince there is no attachment,\nthe gates of craving are closed.\n\n*—Exegesis:* *Blocking* means silencing speech,\n*closing* means restraining the six emotions.\n*—Rhythmic Explanation:* Meaning to seal the nine orifices,\nto preserve essence and guard *qi*.\n\n*—Annotation:* When human nature sharpens its desires,\none must recall the Dao’s *wuwei*,\nto blunt and halt them.\n\n*—Exegesis:* To stop avarice and rivalry.\n\n*—Annotation:* *纷* (fēn, \"entanglement\"), those who nurse grudges endlessly,\nmust recall the Dao’s simplicity and detachment\nto dissolve and explain them.\n\n*—Exegesis:* To release resentment and anger.\n\n*—Annotation:* Even with singular insight,\none must harmonize it to make it dim,\nnot to dazzle and confuse others.\n\n*—Exegesis:* To accommodate the ignorant and vulgar.\n\n*—Annotation:* One must not separate oneself as exceptional.\n\n*—Exegesis:* To blend with worldly affairs.\n\nThe preceding sentences have already been fully explained;\nnow, the text is briefly appended without further elaboration.\nThus, these words are repeated,\nto emphasize their relevance to the path of learning.\n\nThis is called *玄同* (*xuán tóng*).\n*—Annotation:* *玄* (xuán, \"mysterious\"), is heaven.\nIf one acts as above,\nit is said they align with heaven’s Dao.\n\n*—Exegesis:* Having already subdued body and mind,\nthey next harmonize light and obscure their traces,\nthus their conduct is complete and virtuous,\nand they accord with the mysterious principle.\n\n*—Master’s Commentary:* *光* (guāng, \"light\"), is wisdom.\n*尘* (chén, \"dust\"), is folly.\nOrdinary beings adorn their wisdom to dazzle others,\nand indulge their folly to invite suffering,\nbut the sage harmonizes light without dazzling,\nand aligns with dust.\n\nHence, they cannot be approached with intimacy,\n*—Annotation:* They do not take pride in honor,\nnor do they lament solitude.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* *玄同* is without bias,\nthus they cannot be approached with intimacy.\n\nHence, they cannot be shunned with distance;\n*—Annotation:* Their focus is on stillness, without desire,\nand they bear no grudges against others.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* They float universally with the multitude,\nthus they cannot be shunned with distance.\n*—Exegesis:* The Dao resonates with the mysterious,\nand the realm of knowledge is doubly severed—\nhaving forgotten both self and others,\nthey also transcend the notions of intimacy and distance.\n\nThey cannot be exploited for gain,\n*—Annotation:* Their body does not crave wealth and nobility,\nnor their mouth the five flavors.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* Without desire,\nthey cannot be exploited for gain.\n\nThey also cannot be harmed;\n*—Annotation:* They do not compete with the strong for advantage,\nnor do they vie with the bold for *qi*.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* Without desire to contest,\nthey cannot be harmed.\n*—Exegesis:* For gain and harm\nare tied to life and death,\nexistence and annihilation—\nhow much more so when they concern profit and loss.\nHence, *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Do not pursue gain,\nnor shun harm.\"*\n\nThey cannot be elevated to nobility,\n*—Annotation:* They do not govern in chaotic times,\nnor serve in corrupt courts.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* They embody the Dao naturally,\nthus they cannot be elevated to nobility.\n\nThey also cannot be debased to lowliness.\n*—Annotation:* They do not ride on power to become arrogant,\nnor do they bend their will when thwarted.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* They are pure without stain,\nthus they cannot be debased to lowliness.\n*—Exegesis:* For wealth and nobility\narise from honor and disgrace—\nthus praise and blame do not move them,\nnor do they tremble at favor or insult,\nhence they cannot be ranked as noble or ignoble,\nfor nobility and ignobility are only labels of the heart.\n\nThus, they are noble throughout the world.\n*—Annotation:* Their virtue is such\nthat even emperors cannot make them subjects,\nnor lords bend them—\nthey float with the world,\nadapt to survive,\nand avoid harm,\nthus they are noble throughout the world.\n*—Master’s Commentary:* They embody the Dao without obstruction,\nand forget words to let reason flow freely—\ntheir sharpness and entanglements are dissolved,\ntheir light and dust are harmonized—\nsince they defy intimacy and distance,\nand transcend nobility and ignobility,\nthey are thus noble throughout the world.\n*—Exegesis:* Having dispelled both intimacy and distance,\nand emptied their minds of gain and harm,\nthey do not concern themselves with praise or blame,\nnor do they harbor thoughts of nobility or ignobility—\nthus the common folk bear them with reverence,\nand all ranks gladly promote them without fatigue,\nhence the world honors and values them.\n\nThey govern the realm with uprightness,\n*—Annotation:* *以* (yǐ, \"reach\"), heaven appoints those of upright conduct\nto rule over states.\n*—Exegesis:* *以* (yǐ, \"use\"), governance means laws and teachings,\n*治* (zhì, \"order\"), is to harmonize and regulate.\nThe sage leads the world and interacts with beings,\nadapting to circumstances and wielding power—\nthe Dao is used to deploy troops and implement strategy,\nwisdom to regulate the state.\nThis is the era of *pausing arms and refining culture*.\n\nThey use the *奇* (*qí*) to wage war,\n*—Annotation:* *奇* (qí, \"strange\"), is deceit—\nheaven appoints those who practice deception\nto wage war.\n*—Exegesis:* *奇* (qí), is covert deceit.\nWhen disorder must be quelled,\nwar must be waged—\nwar does not reject deception,\nit relies on stratagem and guile.\nThis is the era of *pausing culture and refining arms*.\n\nWar harms itself. A state is like the body. To take the world without action—\n*—Annotation:* To appoint those who act without doing as rulers of the world.\n\n*—Exegesis:* Governing the world through non-action is most noble. If one uses laws and teachings to rule, or deceit and stratagem in war, these are all contrary to the Dao. Only through non-action and non-doing can one take the world.\n\n*—Commentary:* The Way of governance adapts to circumstances like a passing shelter or a sacrificial dog—if grasped too tightly, it only increases harm. Better to remain in non-action, centered in the *Gushu* [1], neither wielding arms nor culture, yet ruling from the hall of state with effortless ease. Thus, things transform without blemish, and the people sing in harmony. The art of governance lies here.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus? By this.\n*—Annotation:* *This*, meaning the present—Laozi says, \"How do I know the will of heaven is so?\" I know it by what I see today.\n\n*—Exegesis:* *This* refers to the reasoning below.\n\n*—Commentary:* The argument assumes: \"How do I know that governing the world must be through non-action?\" The reasoning below reveals it.\n\nThe more taboos a land enforces, the poorer its people grow.\n*—Annotation:* *Land* refers to the ruler; *taboos* mean prohibitions. Excessive restrictions breed deceit, and many prohibitions make the people cunning, deceiving one another for survival—thus poverty.\n\n*—Explanation:* This speaks of artificial governance.\n\n*—Commentary:* Harsh laws multiply offenders, disrupting livelihoods and deepening poverty.\n\nThose who govern themselves cannot follow their true nature but cling to prohibitions, lacking inner virtue—thus poverty.\n\nWhen the people wield many tools, the state grows confused.\n*—Annotation:* *Tools* means *power*—when the people hold much power, their vision is dazzled, their ears deceived, and trust between ruler and subjects erodes, leading to chaos.\n\n*—Exegesis:* *Tools* refers to schemes. If rulers rely too much on cunning, the people respond with deceit, deepening the state’s confusion.\n\nWhen people rely on cleverness, strange devices proliferate.\n*—Annotation:* *People* refers to rulers and feudal lords who favor cleverness—engraving palaces, carving garments—so strange devices arise, and the people below imitate, adorning gold and jade, embroidering colors, endlessly innovating.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Cleverness* means deceitful schemes. *Strange devices* are war machines. If rulers favor war, the people follow, inventing strange devices to earn glory. Those who govern themselves indulge in cleverness, seizing others’ lands, and their divisive hearts only worsen corruption. This sentence further explains the use of war.\n\nWhen laws proliferate, thieves multiply.\n*—Annotation:* *Laws* means luxuries. If luxuries abound, farming declines, and hunger and cold follow—thus thieves multiply.\n\n*—Exegesis:* Having lost non-action, laws become stricter, and those who exploit them become thieves—how could they not multiply?\n\n*—Honor’s Note:* Luxuries are what laws protect. If gold and jade are prized, thieves will rise.\n\n*—Chen’s Note:* It is natural: excessive taboos disrupt balance, many tools shift power downward, cleverness breeds deceit, and more laws only invite greater corruption.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves,*\n*—Annotation:* *Thus the Sage says*—referring to the following.\n\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.\"* The Sage speaks of cultivating the Dao in harmony with heaven, making no artificial changes, yet the people naturally refine themselves.\n\n*—Explanation:* This means preserving nature so that *yuanqi* [2] flows freely.\n\n*—Commentary:* If the ruler remains detached and non-acting, the people naturally transform, abandoning vice for virtue. Laozi, being a Sage, modestly attributes this transformation to the *Shenghua* [3], hence *Zhuangzi* says: \"Metaphorical speech is nineteen out of twenty.\"\n\n*\"I impose no tasks, yet the people grow rich,*\n*—Annotation:* *I impose no tasks*—meaning no forced labor or conscription—so the people secure their livelihoods and prosper.\n\n*—Explanation:* This means the body’s *form* and *qi* flourish when unrestrained.\n\n*—Commentary:* With no artificial demands and no burdens, the four classes [4] settle into their work, the world harmonizes, taxes are light—how could they not prosper?\n\n*\"I value stillness, yet the people align themselves,*\n*—Annotation:* The Sage says, *\"I value stillness\"*—without speaking or teaching, the people naturally become loyal and upright.\n\n*—Explanation:* This means the heart remains empty of deceit, so *qi* resides within the form.\n\n*—Commentary:* If the ruler cherishes stillness and does not disturb the people, they inherit pure customs and return to righteousness.\n\n*\"I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n*—Annotation:* *I desire nothing*—constantly rejecting ornamentation, dressing plainly—so the people follow, becoming unadorned.\n\n*—Explanation:* This means the mind, undisturbed by desires, remains steadfast, so *jingqi* [5] is pure and unexhausted.\n\n*—Commentary:* If the ruler is frugal and unselfish, the people know contentment and simplicity, returning to natural virtue.\n\nFrom *\"Thus the Sage says\"* onward, these lines collectively explain the meaning of *\"taking the world without action.\"*\n\nTheir governance is obscure yet profound,\n*—Annotation:* Their governance is broad and unrestrictive, obscure yet deep—\n\ntheir people are sincere and rich.\n*—Annotation:* Broad governance makes the people sincere and abundant, living in harmony.\n\nThe commentary states:\n*\"Mùn-mùn\"* means expansive and ample.\n*\"Chún\"* means simplicity and sincerity.\nIt speaks of the ruler acting without interference, governance broad and unrestrained—\nso the people, following transformation, are all sincere and unadorned.\n\nWhen governance is *chá-chá*,\n*—Annotation:* Governance is urgent and hasty, its words pressing upon the ears—\nthe people become *quē-quē*.\n*—Annotation:* Governance hasty and urgent—\nthe people, unable to sustain life, grow thin and scattered daily.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Chá-chá* means strict and swift.\n*Quē-quē* means decay and dispersion.\nWhen the ruler favors action, governance becomes oppressive and abrupt—\nthe people suffer its violence, thus many perish and scatter.\n\nTo govern oneself, one must embrace emptiness, forgetfulness, and ease—\nnot clinging to a hasty, urgent mind.\n\nFate as fortune’s foundation,\n*—Annotation:* *Yǐ* means \"from.\"\nFor misfortune arises from fortune—\nwhen people face calamity and repent, blame themselves,\npractice virtue, and follow the Way,\nfortune arrives, and misfortune departs.\n\nFortune as misfortune’s hidden seed.\n*—Annotation:* Fortune lies concealed within misfortune—\nwhen people grow proud from fortune,\nfortune departs, and misfortune comes.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Yǐ* means \"from,\" *nì* means \"concealed.\"\nWhen governance is *mùn-mùn*, fortune is invited;\nwhen *chá-chá*, misfortune is summoned.\nThese three matters stem from the mind—\nfortune lies within misfortune,\nmisfortune hides within fortune—\ntheir principle is not distant.\n\nWho knows their ultimate end?\n*—Annotation:* Misfortune and fortune cyclically generate—\nwho knows their final limit?\n\nThere is no rectitude.\n*—Annotation:* *Wú* means \"not\"—\nthe ruler, failing to rectify himself, brings ruin to the realm.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Shú* means \"who.\"\nThe signs of fortune and misfortune arise from good and evil.\nKarma undetermined, retribution follows—\nthus the wheel turns through the Three Realms,\nreturning through the Six Paths,\nin myriad transformations—\nwho knows their end?\n\nThe superior sage, mindful of saving others,\nembodies this rectitude,\nawakens to the Profound Mystery,\nand does not become the cause of fortune or misfortune—\nthus, no retribution of fortune or misfortune comes.\nHence, *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Misfortune does not arrive, fortune does not come—\nmisfortune and fortune are nonexistent;\nwho would suffer calamity?\"*\n\nNow, why the endless cycle?\nBecause they do not embrace the rectitude of the Way.\n\nRectitude returns as deceit,\n*—Annotation:* *Qí* means \"deceit\"—\nwhen the ruler is unrectified,\neven if the people are rectified,\nthey in turn corrupt the ruler’s deceit.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Qí* means \"hollow deceit.\"\nEven if one studies rectitude with sincerity,\nclinging to its name while failing to forget it,\nit does not align with reality—\nthus it becomes hollow deceit.\n\nVirtue returns as omens of disaster.\n*—Annotation:* Even virtuous people revert to omens of calamity.\n\n*—Commentary:* Though one acts virtuously,\nstill clinging to names and words,\ncontradicting true principle,\nbecoming a portent of misfortune—\nthus *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To act for sound and name is to become a portent of misfortune.\"*\n\n*—Metu’s Note:* If one seeks virtue yet becomes a portent,\nit is the virtue of name alone.\n\n*—Annotation:* Those who attain the Dao’s fortune\nyet fail to uphold unity\nsoon grow proud and swollen—\nevil intent resurfaces.\n\nThe people’s delusion has long endured.\n*—Annotation:* The ruler’s confusion and loss of rectitude\nhas lasted for ages.\n\n*—Annotation:* The world’s people cannot uphold unity,\ndeceived by deceit and falsehood,\nlosing fortune and inviting misfortune—\nthis has been longstanding, not just today.\n\n*—Commentary:* The vulgar and coarse\nbecome portents and deceitful\nthrough their stupidity and delusion—\ntheir error is without beginning,\nnot merely this life.\n\nThus the *Xī Shēng Jing* says:\n*\"Such delusion has endured long.\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\n*—Annotation:* The Sage walks the square path of rectitude\nto guide the people—\nnot to sever or harm them.\n\n*—Annotation:* \"Square\" refers to the rectitude of unity—\nguard it firmly, practice it enduringly,\nnever harming oneself with deceit.\n\n*—Commentary:* The Sage embodies the Dao’s rectitude,\nsetting the standard for the people,\nadapting to circumstances, guiding without coercion—\nnever ruling or forcing them to conform.\n\nThis is the Sage’s admonition,\nurging all to cultivate.\n\nFrugal yet not harmful,\n*—Annotation:* The Sage’s conduct is pure and clear,\nusing it to transform the people—\nnot to harm them.\n\n*—Commentary:* Mysteriously attuned to the empty, illusory nature of things,\nfree from greed or attachment,\nelevated and pure,\navoiding the filth of the world.\n\nThus, cold and filth are both discarded,\ngreed and purity forgotten—\nneither frugal nor impure,\nneither pure nor filthy—\nhence *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Great purity knows no fear,\"*\nand *\"Frugal purity is untrustworthy.\"*\n\n*—Annotation:* \"Pure\" refers to the clarity of *qi*.\nImpurity cannot obstruct the Dao’s practice.\n\nStraight yet not arrogant,\n*—Annotation:* *Sì* means \"to press\"—\nthough the Sage bends to others,\nhe does not assert himself.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Sì* means \"to press.\"\nNaturally upright and refined,\nhis essence untainted by deceit—\nyet he bends to circumstances,\nnot forcing his own straightness.\nThus, the previous chapter says: *\"Great straightness seems crooked.\"*\n\n*—Annotation:* The function of unity is balanced—\nfollowing the heart’s flexibility,\nnot measuring by rigid rules.\n\nIlluminating yet not dazzling.\n*—Annotation:* Though the Sage possesses singular insight,\nhe remains as if obscured—\nnot blinding others with brilliance.\n\n*—Annotation:* The Sage’s transformation is subtle—\nnot imposing square rectitude,\nnot staining others with impurity,\nnot pressing his straightness,\nnot dazzling with light—\nbut cultivating within himself,\nwhile the world transforms naturally.\n\n*—Commentary:* Wisdom’s light shines everywhere,\nyet he conceals his brilliance,\nnot flaunting it before others,\nforgetting even his own illumination.\n\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The brilliance of the slippery doubt is a trap the Sage perceives and confines.\"*\n\nTo govern the people—\n*—Annotation:* This refers to the ruler’s desire to administer the populace.\n\nTo serve the Dao—\n*—Annotation:* Serve, here meaning *use*. One must employ the Way of Heaven, follow the Four Seasons.\n\nThere is nothing better than **frugality**.\n*—Annotation:* *Frugality* (啬), to cherish and conserve.\n\nIn governing the state, one must cherish the people’s wealth—\nnot indulge in **Qin’s extravagance**,\n*—Annotation:* *Qin’s extravagance*, referring to the wasteful policies of the Qin state.\nin cultivating oneself, one must cherish **qi** and **spirit**—\nnot abandon oneself to dissipation.\n\n*—Annotation:* Heaven, the natural order.\n*Style*, law.\nThere is nothing better than **moderation without excess**.\n*—Annotation:* The Sage aligns with Heaven’s Way above,\ntransforms the common folk below—\nemploying the supreme law of **wuwei** (无为).\n\nOnly through **frugality** does one gain early **virtue**—\n*—Annotation:* Early, to precede others;\n**virtue**, attainment.\n\nOnly through **frugality** and cherishing the people’s wealth\ndoes the populace find peace.\nCherishing **qi** and **spirit**,\none attains the Way of Heaven first.\n\n*—Annotation:* How does one gather the people?\nBy wealth—\nthus, through careful conservation,\nthose from all quarters come bearing burdens and arrive,\nearly serving their ruler.\n*—Annotation:* Serve, to submit in service.\n\n*—Annotation:* This **wuwei** method alone\ncan benefit both self and others—\napplied to personal cultivation, it subdues **demons and trials**;\napplied to state governance, it brings distant lands into submission.\n\nEarly **virtue** is called **deep accumulation**—\n*—Annotation:* To first attain Heaven’s Way\nis to deeply accumulate **virtue** within oneself.\n\n*—Annotation:* Deep, profound and weighty.\nAccumulation, layered accumulation.\nTo internally subdue **demons and trials**,\nexternally bring distant regions under control,\none must layer deeds and cultivate **virtue**—\nits power profound and weighty,\nonly then can distant lands submit.\n\n*—Annotation:* The Sage’s accumulated **virtue**\ndraws all under Heaven to his service—\nthen there is none he cannot subdue.\n\n*—Annotation:* *Kè* (克), to be capable.\n*—Annotation:* Those harboring deceit and evil\nare subdued through **unity of qi** and its accumulation.\n*—Annotation:* *Kè* (克), to conquer, also to attain.\nLayered deeds and **virtue**,\nself-benefit and benefit to others,\nwithout loss—\ninternally and externally subdued,\nnone fail to conquer.\n\n*—Annotation:* Through **unity of qi** and its accumulation,\nevil is expelled and diseases cured—\nthus, none fail to conquer.\n\nIf none can conquer,\nthen none know its limits—\n*—Annotation:* If none can be conquered,\nthen none can fathom the depths of one’s own **virtue**.\n\n*—Annotation:* One who understands **corresponding principles**\nfinds none beyond the reach of **Dao’s profound and distant power**—\nnone can know its ultimate bounds.\n\n*—Annotation:* Through **unity of qi** and its accumulation,\nevil is expelled and diseases cured—\nnone can know its full extent,\nthus one’s life endures long.\n\nIf none know its limits,\nthen one can establish a state—\n*—Annotation:* If none can fathom the depths of one’s **virtue**,\nthen one can secure the land and its people,\nbringing governance and blessing.\n\n*—Annotation:* When all principles are harmonized,\ntheir depths and distances are boundless—\nthus, one can rule a state and transform the people,\nbecoming the sovereign of kings and lords.\n\nThe foundation of a state,\none can endure forever.\n*—Annotation:* State and body are analogous;\n**mother**, the Way.\nIf one preserves the Way within the body—\n**qi** unexpended,\nthe Five Spirits untroubled—\nthen one can endure long.\n\n*—Annotation:* As sovereign of a state,\nnurturing all under Heaven,\ntreating all as his children,\nhence called **mother**.\n\nThough **virtue** and deeds may be exalted,\nif they are achieved without attachment,\nand **wuwei** remains pure and subtle,\nthen one can endure forever.\n\nThis is called **deep-rooted and firm-founded**—\n*—Annotation:* One who takes **harmony** (熙) as root,\n**refinement** (精) as foundation,\nlike a tree—\nif its roots are not deep, it is uprooted;\nif its foundation is not firm, it falls—\nmust deeply conceal his **qi**,\nfirmly guard his **refinement**,\nnever letting it leak or disperse.\n\nthe **Dao of enduring life and long vision**.\n*—Annotation:* Those with deep roots and firm foundations\nare the **Dao of enduring life and long vision**.\n\n*—Annotation:* Root, origin.\nFoundation, trace.\nThe root can generate the foundation—\nusing this analogy, the origin gives rise to the trace.\nTo elaborate: the origin is **deep-rooted**,\nits progression is **firm-founded**.\nIf roots are not deep, they become precarious;\nif foundations are not firm, they scatter.\nIt is because roots are deep that one endures long,\nbecause foundations are firm that one’s vision lasts—\nthis explains why the Sage’s **virtue** and **Dao** are both perfect,\nhence concluding with the **Dao of enduring life and long vision**.\n\n*—Annotation:* Vision, illumination.\n\nTo govern a great state,\none must treat it as cooking a small fresh delicacy.\n\n「*—Annotation:* Fresh, fish.\n\nTo cook small fish, one does not remove its entrails,\ndoes not scrape its scales,\ndoes not dare to prod it—\nlest it disintegrate.\n\nTo govern a state with excess brings chaos below;\nto govern the body with excess scatters the essence.\n\n*—Annotation:* Cook, to boil.\nFresh, fish.\nIt is said that if one prods a small fish while boiling, it will disintegrate,\nbut if left undisturbed, it remains whole—\na metaphor: governing with *wuwei* brings great peace,\nwhile agitation leads to ruin.\n\nTo act in the Way across the world,\nits spirits lose their menace.\n*—Annotation:* When one governs the world with virtue and the Way,\nghosts and spirits dare not manifest their malevolence against people.\n\n*—Annotation:* *Lì* (莅), to oversee.\nIt is said that those who govern with righteousness\nprevent malevolent spirits from causing harm.\n\n*—Annotation by Gu (顾):* Spirit refers to their supernatural efficacy.\n\nWhen one governs the world with the Way,\nthe land is at great peace—\nin such times, ghosts and spirits lack the power to manifest harm.\nWhen one cultivates the Way in the body,\ntrue illumination attains unity—\nthose who attain unity are unharmed by spectral forces.\n\nIt is not that their spirits lack efficacy,\nbut that evil cannot enter the righteous—\nthus, they cannot harm natural beings.\n\n*—Annotation by Yu (御):* Earlier, it was said that their spirits lack menace,\nnot that they are extinguished and devoid of spirit—\nonly that they dare not manifest harm to people.\n\n*—Annotation:* Spirit, supernatural efficacy.\nIt is not that these spirits lack efficacy,\nbut that they bring blessings to people\nwithout harming anything.\n\nFor governing the body,\n*xièméi* (馅魅) refers to restless, licentious thoughts.\nIt is said that when one governs the body with righteous principles,\nrestless thoughts cannot harm virtuous conduct—\neven if the mind stirs, true illumination remains,\nand thus cannot harm conduct.\n\n*—Annotation by Jiéjiě (节解):* It is not that spirits lack efficacy,\nbut that the Way resides in the person—\nthus, their spirit cannot harm them.\n\nIt is not that their spirit cannot harm people,\nnor that the Sage cannot harm people.\n*—Annotation:* It is not that spirits cannot harm people,\nbut that the Sage, in office, does not harm people—\nthus, ghosts dare not interfere.\n\n*—Annotation by Yu (御):* Ghosts that manifest harm are so because\nthe Sage has acted contrary to the Way.\nNow, ghosts do not manifest harm because\nthe Sage acts with *wuwei* and purity.\n\n*—Annotation:* All manuscripts originally read *yì* (亦),\nbut Zhang Xi’s and Master Lu’s texts read *zhī* (之).\nSince *yì* and *zhī* resemble each other in script,\n*zhī* was mistakenly written as *yì*—now corrected to *zhī*.\n\nThis means that it is not that these spirits do not harm things,\nbut that the Sage, acting in the Way, can subdue evil—\nthus, ghosts do not harm people.\nPower lies in the Sage’s righteousness—\nhence, it is also said that the Sage does not harm people.\n\nFor governing the body, it is said that\neven if the mind stirs, it cannot harm stillness—\nfor Sage-wisdom subdues it, so though it moves,\nit cannot disturb the tranquil.\n\n*—Annotation by Jiéjiě (节解):* It is said that when a person’s conduct aligns with divine clarity,\nthere are no hidden faults within—\nthus, ghosts cannot harm them.\nThere are no outward crimes—\nthus, the Sage does not punish them.\n\nHeavenly spirits stand guard outside the body,\nprotecting its form within.\nOriginal *qi* is undifferentiated—\nall aid in governing the body.\n\nOne’s conduct follows Heaven above:\nthe head wears the luminosity of sun and moon,\nstars and constellations arrayed within the body.\nSpirit and breath nourish on *yùyīng* (玉英).\nThus, the two do not harm each other.\n*—Annotation:* Ghosts and the Sage—\nboth do not harm each other.\n\nHence, virtue reciprocates.\n*—Annotation:* Those who do not harm each other\nallow people to thrive in the Yang,\nghosts to thrive in the Yin—\npeople preserve their life and nature,\nghosts preserve their spirit—\nthus, virtue reciprocates.\n\n*—Annotation:* The two—ghosts in the Yin, people in the Yang—\neach finds its place, unharmed,\nguarding its domain.\nWith no transgression between them,\npeople extend virtue to ghosts,\nghosts extend grace to people—\nvirtue and kindness circulate,\nthus they attach to one another in harmony.\n\nFor governing the body,\none stills agitation and returns to tranquility,\nfulfilling one’s conduct.\nSince movement and stillness are simultaneous,\nwhat is there to restrain?\n\nNow it is clarified:\nrestraint without restraint,\nresponse without expectation—\nnot responding yet responding.\n\nA great state is the confluence of the world.\n*—Annotation:* To govern a great state is like the river and sea,\nwhich reside in the lowest flow,\nnot opposing the minutest currents.\n\nThe world’s gathering place.\n*—Annotation:* A great state is where all under Heaven assemble.\n\n*—Annotation by Jiéjiě (节解):* The *nìwán* (泥丸) is both great state and small state—\nreceiving from above, it irrigates the *dāntián* (丹田),\nwhich is the earthly frontier.\n\n*—Annotation:* A great state refers to a realm of ten thousand chariots,\n*jiāo* (郊), the outer walls.\n*Zhī* (之), to go.\nIt is said that a great state, vast and accommodating,\nis like the river and sea—\nthe river and sea lie beneath all currents,\nthus all streams rush toward them.\nA great state, acting in the Way with humility and gentleness,\nthus all nations come and pay homage,\nrevering virtue and filling the outer walls.\n\n*Běn* (本) is also written as *jiāo* (交).\nA great state, acting in humility,\nthus exchanges with small states.\n\nThe world’s gathering place is the receptive.\nThe receptive, ever still, overcomes the assertive.\nSoft, yielding, and harmonious—\nnot competing.\nWomen can submit to men because Yin overcomes Yang.\nTheir tranquility comes from not seeking first.\n\n*—Annotation:* The world’s frontier—\nechoing the preceding text to generate the following sentence.\nThe receptive is female, still;\nthe assertive is male, restless.\nIt is said that a great state can make all nations submit and assemble\nonly by employing gentle, receptive stillness—\nthus overcoming restless assertiveness.\nIf it acts with rigidity, it cannot govern.\n\nThus, it is known that governing the body and the state\nmust prioritize gentleness and compliance.\nWith stillness as the foundation.\n*—Annotation:* The Yin Way values tranquil stillness as humility.\n\nThus, a great state, humbling itself to small states,\ntakes them in.\n*—Annotation:* Those who humble themselves\nconstantly attract others.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: **\"以\"** means **\"to employ.\"** **\"下\"** means **\"humility.\"** **\"取\"** means **\"to assimilate and transform.\"** The Sage-King, ruling over great states, skillfully employs humility and gentleness, thus assimilating all nations—near and far—into submission, bringing tribute through layered tributaries. Is this not fitting?\n\nWhen small states humble themselves to great states, they gather under their protection.\n*—Annotation:* This means that regardless of a state’s size, if it practices humility and nurtures others, it will have no faults.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* The great state takes the small as its subjects and servants; the small state takes the great as its allies and support.\n\n*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* The *Upper Seal* (泥丸) represents the great state, while the *Lower Elixir Field* (丹田) represents the small. Practicing the *One Way*, one closes the breath and swallows saliva, letting it descend to the *Lower Elixir Field*, where it transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into *qi*. Through embryonic breathing, it is drawn upward to replenish the brain, then pushed and drawn outward, spreading like clouds across the four seas. Thus, the great takes from the small, and the small gathers under the great.\n\nThe small state, knowing its own lowliness, guards its place with feminine gentleness, gathering within the great state out of reverence for its virtue and moral influence.\n\nThus, sometimes the great takes, sometimes the small gathers.\n*—Annotation:* **\"下\"** refers to the great state humbling itself to the small, and the small humbling itself to the great, alternately taking each other through righteousness.\n\n*—Commentary:* **\"或\"** means **\"indeterminate\"**—when the small state employs gentleness, it gathers under the great; when the great employs humility, it takes the submission of all nations. Though both use humility, their methods differ—one gathers, the other takes.\n\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others; the small state seeks only to enter and serve.\n*—Annotation:* If the great state does not lose its humility, it will encompass and assimilate the small, making them its subjects and servants.\n\n*—Commentary:* The great state employs humility without ulterior motives—only to love and embrace the small states. The small state employs gentleness without hidden intentions—only to enter the great state’s embrace, admiring its virtue and seeking to serve.\n\nBoth achieve what they desire: the great state should thus be humble.\n*—Annotation:* Great and small states each seek what they desire, yet the great state should especially practice humility.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* One seeks subjects and servants; the other seeks allies and support. Both obtain what they desire, yet the great state must always guard against arrogance, hence it should be humble.\n\n*—Commentary:* The two refer to great and small states—both encompassing and serving, each fulfilling their desires. Though both may use gentleness, the great state should particularly emphasize humility. Why? For things naturally press down the great—small things do not overpower the great. Thus, those who overpower the great should humble themselves, adhering to the principle of lowering the high.\n\n*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* The two refer to the *Upper Seal* (泥丸) and the *Lower Elixir Field* (丹田). The *Upper Seal* desires descending *qi*, while the *Lower Elixir Field* desires ascending *qi*, together forming a single divine transformation.\n\nThe *Dao* is the profound essence of all things.\n*—Annotation:* **\"奥\"** means **\"to conceal.\"** The *Dao* is the hidden repository of all things, containing all within itself.\n\n*—Commentary:* The *Dao* is the wondrous, boundless principle of emptiness and flow, the innate nature of all beings. **\"奥\"** means both **\"profound\"** and **\"hidden\"**—it speaks of the *Dao* generating all existence, encompassing all life, without exclusion, thus serving as the hidden repository of all things.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\n*—Annotation:* The virtuous person regards the *Dao* as their bodily treasure, thus daring not to stray from it.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* The virtuous know that adherence to the *Dao* brings flourishing, while abandonment brings ruin. Thus, they cherish and practice it without ceasing.\n\n*—Commentary:* Those who cultivate the *Dao* perceive true nature, obtaining the *Mystic Pearl* in the *Crimson Stream*, hence they treasure and honor it.\n\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n*—Annotation:* The *Dao* is the unvirtuous’ last reliance. Even in calamity or peril, they may yet repent and humble themselves.\n\n*—Commentary:* **\"保\"** means **\"to uphold.\"** The vulgar, entangled in material desires and competitive striving, cannot uphold the *Dao*. Their speech is flattering and deceitful, like market haggling—buyers seek swift purchase, sellers swift sale. Unable to guard true humility, they prioritize self over others, yet still claim noble conduct, thus distancing themselves from the *Dao*.\n\nSweet speech can be sold in the market,\n*—Annotation:* Only sweet speech can be traded in the marketplace. Once the exchange is complete, the buyer and seller part ways—no further harmony remains. Sweet words and flattery are sought eagerly by buyers, swiftly sold by merchants.\n\nNoble conduct can elevate a person.\n*—Annotation:* **\"加\"** means **\"to distinguish.\"** A person of noble conduct can set themselves apart from the common, yet this is insufficient to elevate the *Dao*.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* Sweet and pleasing words can be traded like goods in the market; noble and lofty conduct can distinguish a person. By analogy, the Sage uses sweet, virtuous teachings and lofty, detached conduct to transform the unvirtuous—just as merchants sell goods, people follow in emulation.\n\n*—Commentary:* The unvirtuous, with shallow hearts and hollow speech, adorn themselves with flattery like market traders seeking profit, yet they cannot uphold true humility. They place themselves before others, boast of their own nobility, and domineer over people. Such conduct, far from the *Dao*, only distances them further.\n\nWhy abandon those who are unvirtuous?\n*—Annotation:* Though unvirtuous, they should be transformed by the *Dao*. In the age of the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue and teaching were pure.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* Even the unvirtuous can be transformed by virtue. Why abandon them?\n\n*—Commentary:* **\"奚\"** means **\"why.\"** The Sage’s *Dao* is boundless in its reach, universally salvific. Though beings may be unvirtuous, how could there be abandonment? Its compassion covers all, aiding without exclusion.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is enthroned,\nand the Three Ministers are appointed,\n*—Annotation:* To transform the unvirtuous through teaching.\n\n*—Commentary:* Having aided without exclusion, the proper order of the world must be established. Thus, the Son of Heaven is enthroned to govern all affairs, and the Three Ministers are appointed to discuss the *Dao*.\n\nTo harmonize *Yin* and *Yang*,\nand to refine and flourish in governance,\nwith intent on guiding all classes like a vessel,\nand protecting all life from poison.\n\nSince the opening of the cosmos, the True Sovereign has manifested in the world, embodying the *Dao* and, through expedient means, assuming the role of emperor, establishing an administration to emulate the Three Pure Ones.\n\nThough one may present a jade tablet held aloft—\npreceded by a team of four horses—\nit is not as good as simply sitting and advancing this *Dao*.\n*—Annotation:* Even if one arrives with a high-capped carriage bearing a perfect jade tablet, it is still inferior to sitting in quietude and cultivating this *Dao*.\n\n*—Commentary:* *\"Jade tablet\"* refers to holding a round, flawless jade tablet. *\"Four horses\"* denotes a single carriage. In ancient times, when summoning a scholar, one would first purify oneself and present the jade tablet, then dispatch a carriage drawn by four horses. Though such offerings bring wealth and honor, they pale in comparison to the effortless, forgetful cultivation of this *Dao*. Why? For cultivating the *Dao* grants longevity, while wealth and honor are but great calamities. Hence, Guangchengzi said: *\"Human life in the world is like a cloud soaring in the sky—its presence fleeting, vanishing in an instant. Measured by this standard, it is better to withdraw far from such things.\"*\n\n*—Master Gu’s Note:* To maintain a spotless reputation is called \"noble conduct,\" but one who prides himself in conduct may surpass others—yet this is not the ultimate.\n\n*—Master Sun’s Note:* Fine words can outvalue all goods, and noble conduct can elevate one above others. Yet the *Dao* expressed in words is bland, without flavor. The Sage acts without action, teaches without speech. How could he adorn speech to please the ears of the people or embellish conduct to dazzle the eyes of all things?\n\nWhy then was this *Dao* held in such esteem in antiquity?\nIt is not that seeking brings attainment,\n\n「Annotations: The reason antiquity held this *Dao* in such high regard was not that one could seek it daily and attain it through distant travels, but rather that it could be found within oneself. ○Master Gu notes: There is no need for distant searching—one seeks it daily, but its accumulation lies within the self, and its attainment rests in the heart. Its profound enlightenment resides within me. Would one only seek to avoid guilt when already guilty? ○Annotations: \"Guilt\" refers to suffering in turbulent times under tyrannical rulers, where arbitrary punishments prevail. Cultivating the *Dao* can resolve resentment and spare one from the evils of the multitude. ○Kumarajiva and others say: By dedicating oneself to the virtuous *Dao*, one avoids all evils. Thus, it is held in highest esteem by the world. ○Annotations: With profound *Dao* and virtue, nothing escapes its nurturing embrace—preserving life, governing the realm with ease, and remaining serene in non-action. Hence, it is worthy of the world’s reverence. ○Master Yu notes: The *Dao* lies in enlightenment, not in seeking. Unlike wealth or silk, which can be sought daily and obtained, it is said that one does not seek it daily to attain it. Once enlightened, there is no burden of guilt—why wait for guilt to arise before seeking release? Thus, it is worthy of the world’s reverence.\n\n○Exegesis: Why did the sages of old hold this *Dao* so precious? Simply because it is not a matter of seeking it day by day to obtain it. The enlightened see the *Dao* before them, while the deluded wander countless kalpas without comprehension. Even if, from beginningless time, one has been bound by birth and death, by guilt and retribution—once returned to the source, all is instantly freed. Such divine power is beyond measure, hence the world reveres it as the object of all inquiry.\n\nNon-action (*wuwei*), ○Annotations: Achieved through natural unfolding, requiring no artificial contrivance.\n○Exegesis: In perfect harmony with the heart’s essence, it never loses its true illumination. Illuminating all action, it is itself the very nature of non-action. Thus, non-action is action, and action is non-action.\n\n○Concise Analysis: To say \"one does not act\" means one does not act for the self.\n\nNon-doing (*wu shi*), ○Annotations: Refraining from preparation, eliminating distractions and unnecessary affairs.\n○Exegesis: \"Affairs\" refers to sensory phenomena—colors, sounds, material forms—all things. In perfect alignment with true emptiness, one’s illumination does not contradict stillness. Though engaged in affairs, there is no attachment to them.\n\n○Concise Analysis: To say \"one does not do\" means one does not act for others.\n\nFlavorless (*wu wei*), ○Annotations: Deep contemplation and foresight—savoring the *Dao*’s essence.\n○Exegesis: \"Flavor\" denotes attachment and clinging. With both root and object emptied, color and taste both cease. Though one may still engage with taste, there is no lingering obstruction.\n\nGreat and small, much and little, ○Annotations: A call to observe restraint and discipline.»\n\n「One wishes to invert greatness into smallness, abundance into scarcity—this is the Dao/Way of nature. Returning resentment with virtue.\n\n○Annotations: Cultivating goodness and the Dao/Way, extinguishing calamity before it arises.\n○Concise Analysis: For those who act without doing (*wu wei*), engage in affairs without attachment, and savor taste without lingering—if greatness and smallness, abundance and scarcity, are both kept within their proper bounds, then there is no transgression to provoke resentment. If one’s mind arises with chasing sensory phenomena and exceeds one’s natural portion, harming one’s true nature, then there is neither greatness nor smallness—all become resentment and anger. Now, since one abides by one’s portion and maintains perfect harmony, one can thus return resentment with virtue.\n\n○Exegesis: Resentment is anger. Returning means recompensing. From the beginning of existence onward, great and small offenses, abundant and scarce deeds—if one seeks to cry out and eliminate them all at once, one must first apply the three kinds of virtuous mind: *wu wei*, non-attachment to affairs, and non-lingering with taste. Then the Three Worlds are emptied, all dharmas are tranquil and void, and the unity of self and other is realized—what lingering remains? Hence the previous chapter states: \"By what virtue/power can one be freed from crime?\" This is what it refers to.\n\nEndeavoring the difficult in the easy, ○Annotations: To seek to accomplish difficult matters, one must first practice in easy ones before they are perfected.\n\n○Exegesis: *Tú* means to plan and measure. *Nán* refers to retribution for misdeeds. *Yì* denotes the initial mind.\n\nIt states that those who wish to plan and dispel the hardships of evil paths must first observe the initial mind. If there is no action, there will be no retribution.\n\nThe great surpasses the small.\n○Annotation: To accomplish great deeds, one must begin with small ones—calamities arise from the small.\n\n○The Master said: Those who indulge their passions and desires find all actions difficult and all matters great. Now, if one seeks to plan and measure their difficulties, to undertake their greatness, they must act when their nature is yet undispersed and their boundaries untransgressed—that is, when they are still in their easy and small beginnings.\n\n○Exegesis: *Xiǎo* means small. Great calamities originate from the minute. This clarifies that to extinguish evil fruits, one must first eliminate the causes.\n\nGreat undertakings under heaven must begin with what is easy.\nGreat affairs under heaven must begin with what is small.\n○Annotation: This elucidates the earlier precepts.\n\nThus, the Sage never undertakes what is great.\n○Annotation: This reflects humility.\n\n○Exegesis: *Zuò* means to initiate. The hardships and retributions of the world necessarily arise from the easy mind—speaking of how a single thought of the initial mind can easily create karma. Hence, great calamities must begin with the small, growing from the subtle to the manifest, gradually forming great conflicts. Therefore, to remove evil retributions, one must first restrain the initial mind.\n\nThus, one can achieve the great.\n○Annotation: All under heaven converge upon it.\n\n「Lightly given promises are bound to lack trustworthiness. ○*Annotation*: One does not lightly speak.\n\n○*Exegesis*: It speaks of those who lightly promise—losing the substance of self-respect. ○*Commentary*: Here, a metaphor is introduced. *Nuo* (诺) means \"to assent or agree.\" *Guǎ* (寡) means \"few or scarce.\" Those who lightly assent to others’ requests will inevitably be few in truthfulness, later incurring the blame of untrustworthiness.\n\nTo act lightly will bring many hardships. ○*Annotation*: One must not neglect potential calamities. ○*Commentary*: Lightly assenting to others leads to few truths; acting lightly in deeds will later bring many hardships.\n\n○*Commentary*: This combines the metaphors. Lightly assenting to others leads to untrustworthiness, just as lightly committing sins will invite the heavy retribution of the Eight Difficulties (八难). Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must be solemn and deliberate, never reckless.\n\nThus, the Sage finds even difficulty hard,\n○*Annotation*: The Sage weighs actions and matters with great deliberation, seeking to block their origins.\nand so never faces difficulty.\n○*Annotation*: The Sage’s lifelong absence of hardship arises from deep avoidance of harm.\n\n○*Commentary*: *Yóu* (犹) means \"still\" or \"even.\" The Sage of true Daoic cultivation has no difficulty or ease, yet still finds difficulty hard and does not act upon it, thus avoiding blame for hardship. How much more so for the common folk who indulge their passions!\n\nThis is a general precept for the Sage and the vulgar alike.\nHence, Guo Xiang’s annotation on *Zhuangzi* states: \"The Sage, though entering fire, does not feel its heat, yet never once stepped into the fire.\" Again, he says: \"Avoiding fire is not fleeing its heat—this is the very meaning.\"\n\nIts tranquility is easy to uphold,\n○*Annotation*: In governing oneself and the realm, the tranquil is easily maintained.\n○*Commentary*: *An* (安) means \"tranquil,\" *chí* (持) means \"to uphold.\" When the Sage’s spirit is still and undisturbed, no desires have yet arisen—at such times, it is very easy to cultivate and guard against them.\n\nits latent state is easy to plan against;\n○*Annotation*: When desires or calamities have not yet taken form, they are easy to forestall.\n○*Commentary*: *Zhào* (兆) means \"signs or indications,\" *móu* (谋) means \"to plan or strategize.\" Though desires may arise in the mind, no form has yet manifested in the external world. At this moment, one should restrain the mind and return to stillness, for the karmic deed has not yet taken root—thus, it is easy to plan against and consider.\n\nits frailty is easy to shatter,\n○*Annotation*: Calamities and chaos have not yet stirred in the morning or evening, nor have desires shown in form or expression—like something brittle, they are easily broken away.\nits subtlety is easy to disperse.\n○*Annotation*: Before matters become manifest, they are small and easily scattered.\n\n○*Commentary*: *Cuì* (脆) means \"brittle or fragile.\" Like a gourd whose fruit has not yet hardened, it is fragile and easily broken. When the initial mind arises with defilements, it is the same—karmic deeds are shallow and thus easily removed.\n\nTo act upon it before it arises,\n○*Annotation*: When one seeks to do something, one must act before its sprouts take root.\n○*Commentary*: *Wéi* (为) means \"to cultivate or study.\" The Sage’s cultivation and guarding are constant, even before desires arise—this explains *its tranquility is easy to uphold*.\n\nto govern it before it falls into disorder.\n○*Commentary*: *Luàn* (乱) means \"disorder,\" referring to the mind being ensnared by karmic deeds and thus clouded and disordered. Now, though the mind may sprout defilements, no form has yet appeared in the external world. At this very moment, it is easy to align with reason—this explains *its latent state is easy to plan against*.\n\nA tree with arms’ embrace grows from a hair’s end;\n○*Annotation*: From small to great.\n○*Commentary*: A hundred-surrounding tree (百围之木) originates from a hair’s tip (毫微). This metaphor illustrates how threefold heavy conflicts (三涂重衅) arise from a single defiled thought. The tree is used as a metaphor because, though it grows from nothingness, it is not inherently \"nothing\"—it is formed by the four dusts (四尘). Likewise, defilements arise from emptiness, yet are not truly \"nothing,\" for they are shaped by the four dusts as well.\n\nTroubles and vexations are thus of no inherent substance,\n○*Annotation*: They emerge from emptiness.\n\nnine-tiered towers are built from piled earth;\n○*Annotation*: From low to high.\n○*Commentary*: *Céng* (层) is akin to \"levels.\" A nine-level tower (九级之台) begins with a single basket of soil (累土). This metaphor illustrates how nine nights of calamity (九夜之祸) arise from a single defiled thought—it deeply warns all learners to be cautious.\n\nand a thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet. ○*Annotation*: From near to far.\n\nThe *Commentary* reads: The *River-Upper* text states \"thousand-li,\" but here it speaks of \"hundred *rèn*.\"[^1]\nFor seven *chi* is called a *rèn*, and a lofty peak of a hundred *rèn* in height begins with its first step.\nTreading the eightfold gates of suffering arises from a defiled mind.\nThe prior analogy has yet to be fully realized.\n\nThe one who acts brings about its ruin.\n*Annotation*: To act in affairs corrupts spontaneity; to act in principle corrupts benevolence and compassion; to act in form corrupts spirit.\n\nThe one who clings loses it.\n*Annotation*: Clinging to gain leads to its cessation; clinging to enmity forfeits one’s life; obstinacy yields nothing, while yielding returns it.\n\nThe *Master’s Response* says: All worldly attachments are deluded and clinging; unable to forget or release, every movement becomes attachment. The clinger seeks possession, yet reason dictates loss.\n\nThe *Commentary* explains: The Supreme Dao is empty and boundless, without action or attachment. Worldly minds are inverted, with attachment and contrivance. Action leads to peril, hence \"ruin\"; clinging contradicts reality, hence \"loss.\"\n\nThus, the Sage acts not, and so knows no ruin;\n*Annotation*: The Sage does not indulge in superficial adornments, nor covet material gains or harm others, and thus knows no corruption.\n\nacts not in clinging, and so knows no loss.\n*Annotation*: The Sage teaches the ignorant with virtue and aids the poor with wealth, holding nothing back, and thus loses nothing to others.\n\nYet the people, in their pursuits, often nearing completion, bring ruin upon themselves.\n*Annotation*: \"From\" means \"to act.\" The people’s affairs, nearing fulfillment, grow greedy for position and fame, indulgent in excess, and thus self-destruct.\nThe *Commentary* states: \"Near\" means \"close.\" All people engage in contrived endeavors, restless and competitive, distinguishing and selecting without foresight. Ever seeking near-completion, they begin but do not finish, hence their frequent ruin.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: Few have beginnings, but fewer still have endings.\nTo be as vigilant at the end as at the beginning brings no ruin.\n*Annotation*: The end must mirror the beginning; do not grow slack.\n\nThe *Commentary* warns: This admonishes learners to fortify their Dao-heart, steadfast from beginning to end, lest there be ruin. Within the Six Perfections, this is the fourth.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not;\n*Annotation*: The Sage desires what others reject—when others seek display, the Sage hides brilliance; when others seek ornamentation, the Sage seeks simplicity; when others lust after wealth and form, the Sage seeks virtue and power.\n\nvalues not the hard-to-obtain treasures;\n*Annotation*: The Sage does not dazzle with adornments nor devalue stone while esteeming jade.\n\nlearns what others do not learn;\n*Annotation*: The Sage learns what others cannot—while others learn cunning, the Sage learns spontaneity; while others learn to govern the world, the Sage learns to govern the self, guarding the true Dao.\n\nand reverses the errors of the multitude.\n*Annotation*: The multitude learns in reverse—errors become ends, reality becomes superficial. To reverse is to restore the original and true.\n\nThe *Master’s Response* says: The Sage does not seek excessive learning.\n\nThe *Commentary* elaborates: The Sage’s luminous insight comes from Heaven, differing from common wisdom. Knowing all phenomena as empty and illusory, no desirable object appears. Thus, within desire, no desire-form is seen. Having no desire for what others desire, how could jade and silk be valued?\n\nFurther, comprehending true and false as undifferentiated, the Sage neither learns nor fails to learn. Learning is not learning, and not-learning is learning—no distinction between learning and not-learning. Hence, the *Western Ascension Sutra* says: *\"I learn nothing, yet I illuminate spontaneity.\"*\n\nThe *River-Upper* text reads *\"reverse,\"* while other editions say *\"prevent.\"*[^2] To prevent is to guard against the calamities of those who cling to contrivance, unable to forget learning.\n\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\n*Annotation*: Teaching people to return to their original and true nature, desiring to assist the natural essence of all things.\n\nyet daring not to act.\n*Annotation*: The Sage’s movements follow naturally, daring not to contrive, lest they stray from the root.\n\nThe *Commentary* explains: \"Aid\" means \"assist\" and \"guide.\" All beings inherently possess a correct and natural disposition, yet delusion and attachment cause them to stray from the Dao and lose authenticity.

The text speaks of \"Great Harmony,\"\n\n顺亦有大小乎。\ndoes harmony not have degrees of greatness and smallness?\n\n答曰：夫以顺对违，\n*The Answer* states: Harmony is contrasted with defiance,\n\n虽顺而小，\nthough it may be small harmony,\n\n今不顺不违，\nbut when one neither defies nor aligns with worldly matters,\n\n而违而顺，\nyet both defies and harmonizes—\n\n顺不异违，\nharmony is not different from defiance,\n\n违不乖顺，\nand defiance is not contrary to harmony—\n\n所以出处语默，\nthus, in conduct and speech, one follows the Dao silently,\n\n唯道是从，\nconforming only to the Dao,\n\n和光同尘，\nblending one’s brilliance with the

it is called \"Great Harmony.\"\n\n江海所以能为百谷王者，\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all streams is that\n\n以其善下之，\nthey excel in humility.\n\n注：江海以卑下，故众流共归之，若人民归就王者也。\n*Annotation*: The rivers and seas, being lowly and humble, thus gather all streams, just as the people gather to a sovereign.\n\n○疏：王，往也。\nThe *Commentary* explains: \"Sovereign\" means \"to go toward.\"\n\n百谷，百川也。\n\"All streams\" refers to the hundred rivers.\n\n言江海所以百川之所归往者，\nThe rivers and seas are where the hundred rivers converge because\n\n以其善居洼下之地也。\nthey excel in dwelling in lowly

folk converge.\n\n故能为百谷王。\nThus they can be sovereigns of all streams.\n\n注：以其卑下故能为百谷王也。\n*Annotation*: Because of their humility and lowliness, they can be sovereigns of all streams.\n\n○疏：此结成其义，\nThe *Commentary* concludes its meaning:\n\n故经云：海为百川王。」\nthus the text says: \"The sea is the sovereign of all rivers.\"」\n\nThus the Sage desires to be above the people,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Desires to be above the people.\"\n\nyet speaks of humility;\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Follows the Way of the rivers and seas, abiding in humility and modesty.\"\n\nThey wish to have all beings\nreside above themselves,\nso they display a gentle demeanor,\nconstantly humbling themselves.\n\nThey desire to lead the people,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Desires to be before the people.\"\n\nyet place themselves behind them.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"They lead others while placing themselves last.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"To have beings before oneself, one must retreat in self and reside behind all things, hence the text says: *All who have not attained the Dao, I always do not hold in hope.* The former advances yet ends in arrogance, while the latter guards humility yet secretly progresses. Thus the Sage, though above the people,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"The Sage, though above the people as their ruler, does not oppress them with their exalted status, hence the people revere them without feeling burdened.\"\n\n*The Commentary* further elucidates: \"The Sage is tranquil, unassuming, and free from self-interest, with few desires. As their ruler, they govern with light taxes and minimal labor, so the people are not weighed down. Alternatively: The Sage’s virtue extends to all things, so the people bear and uphold them without chaos.\"\n\nand before them,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"The Sage, though before the people, does not obscure them with their brilliance, so the people love them as they would parents, never harming them.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"As rulers who stand before all things, they bring harmony to the realm, making the people sing and strike the earth in joy. The world is peaceful and prosperous, their benefits vast, yet none are harmed. Alternatively: The Sage’s virtue is boundless, the people willingly embrace it, cherishing their blessings—how dare they harm?\"\n\nthus the world delights in upholding them without tiring.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"The Sage’s love and benevolence are deep, treating the people as their own children, hence the world takes joy in supporting them as their ruler, never wearying.\"\n\nBecause they do not contend,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"The heavens do not weary of the Sage, for the Sage does not compete with others for precedence.\"\n\nthe world cannot contend with them.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"All speak of my Dao as great, yet I feign foolishness as if unworthy.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"The *River Above* text reads *xìao* (肖), while other families render it *xiào* (笑). *Smile* refers to the Sage’s natural harmony and profound enlightenment, so all beings cannot but revere them as the Great Sage. Yet why does it seem so? Only because, in dealing with others, they are humble and yielding, never boasting or scoffing, hence the result.\"\n\n*Master Gu* states: \"Because they do not align with others, it says *unworthy* (不肖). The Sage’s Dao is exalted and virtuous, indeed worthy of greatness, yet they conceal their traces like dust, their presence indeterminate—neither appearing wise nor foolish, hence *unworthy*.\"\n\nFor only the great\nseem unworthy.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Only those whose virtue is truly great would harm themselves by boasting, so they feign foolishness as if unworthy, making no distinctions or divisions, not demeaning others while elevating themselves. If *worthy* (肖) were long-standing,\n*The Annotation* explains: *Worthy* (肖) means *good* (善). It refers to those who excel in debate and benevolence, yet elevate themselves in speech, implementing meticulous governance—such as the petty scholars of old.\"\n\ntheir refinement is indeed shallow.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Only the petty-minded are refined in debate and benevolence, not the noble.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"The Sage alone, with their vast virtue, does not boast or scoff before others. If they did, they would long be among the petty. *Worthy* (肖) means *good*—the people cannot follow the good Dao because of the Sage’s greatness. The Sage’s greatness is why they cannot practice the good Dao, for they must long remain humble and lowly.\"\n\n*Master Gu* states: \"The Great Sage is beyond comparison. If their form had a fixed nature and their wisdom a constant measure, then their Dao would be constrained and rigid—this is the mark of the petty, not the sublime Great Sage.\"\n\nI possess three Treasures,\ntreasures that I hold fast.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"The Sage says, *I possess three Treasures*, which they embrace and rely upon.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"Thus the Sage’s virtue is great, yet they do not boast or align themselves with others, because they depend on the Three Treasures, which are precious and held firm.\"\n\nThe first is **cí** (慈, compassion),\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Loving the people as their own children.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"Compassionate thoughts for all beings, delivering them from suffering and bringing them joy—this is the Dao’s Treasure.\"\n\nThe second is **jiǎn** (俭, frugality),\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Taxing and taking as if from oneself.\"\n\n*Master Yu* states: \"Compassion means broad salvation; frugality means sufficient resources.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"Content with little, knowing satisfaction, guarding one’s portion without greed—this is the scripture’s Treasure.\"\n\nThe third is **bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān** (不敢为天下先, not daring to be first under heaven).\n*The Annotation* explains: \"They hold to humility, never taking the lead.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"Humility and feigned weakness, placing others before themselves, retreating to benefit others—this is the Teacher’s Treasure.\"\n\n*Master Jié* states: \"It refers to the Treasures of **jīng-qì-shén** (精气神) within a person’s form, which they preserve to sustain life.\"\n\nCompassion makes them **yǒng** (勇, courageous),\n*The Commentary* explains: \"Within them lies great compassion, outwardly extending to all beings, hence their courage to enter the Three Realms and rescue all.\"\n\nfrugality makes them broad;\n*The Annotation* explains: \"The sovereign’s body, if frugal, makes the people’s daily use vast and great.\"\n\n*The Commentary* explains: \"All phenomena are empty and illusory; they unite without greed, maintaining simplicity and purity, hence their virtue is vast.\"\n\nand not daring to be first under heaven,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Not daring to be first under heaven.\"\n\nthus they can fulfill their role as vessels of the long-lasting.\n\n「The *Annotation* explains: \"To fulfill the role of *long-lasting vessels* refers to those who have attained the Dao. I can be the foremost among those who embody the Dao.\"\n\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: \"The virtues of compassion and frugality, when tempered with humility, grow ever brighter. When their brilliance is shared with others, none will weary of it, hence they can become the sovereign vessels of the long-lasting.\"\n\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"It is only because of their courage to rescue the common folk that they retreat from the world to dwell alone in the Celestial Capital, becoming the foremost among all the sages. When descending to the mortal realm, they occupy the august position of the Nine Ranked, the sovereign of the divine vessel. Now, however, they abandon their compassion and courage—\n*The Annotation* explains: \"In this age, they combine the seven aspects of compassion into mere martial prowess.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"They discard compassion and instead revel in fierce valor.\"\n\nThey abandon their frugality and vast virtue—\n*The Annotation* explains: \"They combine their frugality into mere extravagance.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"They forsake their simplicity and instead indulge in greed for worldly things.\"\n\nThey abandon their humility and instead seek to be first—\n*The Annotation* explains: \"They combine their self-effacement into a rush to lead.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"They abandon the mind of retreat and instead hasten toward advancement.\"\n\nThus, they court death.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Such actions inevitably lead one to the path of destruction.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"Summing the three transgressions above—rejecting the Three Treasures—they plunge into the Three Abysses, hence the declaration: *Thus, they court death.*\"\n\nNow, compassion: in war, it brings victory; in defense, it ensures steadfastness.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Those who embody compassion inspire the people’s loyalty, uniting hearts and minds. Thus, in war, they conquer their foes, and in defense, they remain unshaken.\"\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: \"When leading armies with compassion, soldiers are moved by gratitude, ensuring swift triumph.\"\n*The Inner Explanation* adds: \"The six senses are like soldiers; if they are not ensnared by the six dusts, they achieve victory.\"\nAgain, when defending with compassion, the people’s hearts align, making the defense unbreakable.\n*The Inner Explanation* adds: \"Guarding with a compassionate, empty mind fortifies the Dao-heart, rendering it impervious to assault.\"\n\nWhen Heaven intends to save them, it shields them with compassion.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Heaven rescues those who practice compassion, endowing them with its nature to aid themselves.\"\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: \"To wage war and defend with compassion is not merely to unite the people—Heaven’s Way is profound, and it too will save and protect them.\"\nVictory in war is Heaven’s salvation.\nSteadfastness in defense is Heaven’s guardianship.\nAll this is because of compassion, hence it is said: *When Heaven intends to save them, it shields them with compassion.*\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"The Celestial Sovereign of the Dao rescues and protects those who practice compassion, using compassion itself to guard them.\"\n\nThus, within the Three Treasures, compassion takes precedence, and among the Four Virtues, it is paramount. Truly, compassion’s meaning is vast!\n\nThe ancient wise warriors did not rely on force,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"It is said that moral cultivation is valued over martial might.\"\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: \"士 (*shì*) means *affairs*. Those who govern well through the Dao prioritize virtue, hence they do not emphasize force.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"The ancient wise cultivated the Dao in stillness and retreat, never abandoning compassion for martial valor.\"\n\nThe skilled warriors do not rage,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Those who wage war through the Dao suppress evil in their hearts and cut off misfortune before it arises, harboring no anger.\"\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: \"If conflict is unavoidable, one must respond—but compassion makes it skillful, hence no reliance on wrath.\"\n*The Sectional Explanation* adds: \"This means *closure*—harmonizing the essence, so all spirits rejoice.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"Those who penetrate the emptiness of all phenomena can subdue enemies before they arise. Their wondrous body transcends both compliance and defiance, hence they experience neither joy nor anger.\"\n\nThe skilled conquerors do not contend,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Those who conquer through the Dao draw near with benevolence and seek the distant with virtue, never clashing with enemies, who thus submit of their own accord.\"\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: \"Military triumph lies in harmony; harmony means no contention.\"\n*The Sectional Explanation* adds: \"This means *unifying the mouth*—all ghosts bow in submission, hence *no contention*.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"If one is untouched by the dusts, it is called conquering enemies. Since there is neither joy nor anger, what is there to contend over?\"\n\nThe skilled leaders place themselves below others.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Those who skillfully employ others always practice humility.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"Those who embody humility are naturally followed by others, hence they can command their use.\"\n\nThus, the virtue of non-contention—\n*The Annotation* explains: \"This refers to the preceding point of placing oneself below others.\"\n—is the very Dao of not contending for the realm.\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"Not contending with others allows one’s own virtue to flourish; this concludes the section on skilled conquerors who do not contend.\"\n\nThis is called employing the strength of others.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Those who place themselves below others can employ the strength of their ministers.\"\n*Zhang’s Explanation* adds: \"If one delights in leading others, they forget their own toil.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"Through humility and yielding softness, one does not exert dominance over others, yet others submit and serve one’s purposes; this concludes the section on skilled leaders who place themselves below others.\"\n\nThis is to align with Heaven,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Those who practice this can match Heaven’s virtue.\"\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: \"The virtue of skilled conquest is non-contention, and employing others is using their strength. Thus, one can align with Heaven and claim the imperial title—this is the supreme Dao of antiquity.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"Align (*pèi*) means *to harmonize*. Heaven refers to *nature*.\"\n\nThe **extreme** is the **fruit of the Dao**.\nIt speaks of those who cultivate the Dao with skill—\nprofoundly embodying true emptiness,\npenetrating the interplay of opposition and compliance,\nnot contending with things—\nthus harmonizing with the ultimate principle of nature,\nand attaining the **supreme Dao** of antiquity’s origin.\nThis is the **conclusion**.\n\nOn wielding arms, there is a saying:\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Chen’s martial teachings—\nLaozi despised the age’s use of arms,\nso he framed this principle under his own words.\"\n*The Commentary* elaborates: \"Wielding arms refers to **strategic wisdom**,\nsubduing and transforming beings—\nalso how the Sage employs the six senses\nto engage with the dusty realm.\"\n\nThere is a saying—\nits meaning lies in the following text.\n\nI dare not act as the **initiator**,\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Initiator (*zhǔ*) means *first*—\nI dare not first raise arms.\"\nas but the **guest**.\n*The Annotation* explains: \"Guest means *yielding without leading*—\nin wielding arms, one must follow Heaven’s movement before acting.\"\n*The Chapter Explanation* states:\n\"Upper arms refer to **speech**,\nlower arms refer to **subtle action**.\nEmpty speech harms oneself,\nso one speaks in humility and restraint.\nLightly employing subtle action depletes one’s essence,\nso one does not dare to lead but yields instead.\"\n\n*The Annotation* explains:\n\"‘Master’ refers to **my own body**,\n‘guest’ refers to **past defilements**—\nspeaking of how the roots and defilements are both empty,\nand **self** and **phenomena** are all illusory.\nSince there is no **self** to act upon,\nnor any **defilements** to be stained,\nI dare not advance an inch for fear of retreating a foot.\"\n\n*The Annotation* explains:\n\"Advance\" means **taking**,\n\"retreat\" means **letting go**.\n‘Little’ signifies **nothing**,\n‘much’ signifies **something**.\"\n\nOnce **discriminating wisdom** and **phenomena** are both abandoned,\nand **roots** and **defilements** forgotten,\nthe **Mystic Oneness** is realized,\nfree from the duality of **self** and **other**—\nthus, there is nothing in **non-action** to be sought,\nnor anything in **action** to be embraced.\n\nThis is called **\"actionless action.\"**\n*The Annotation* explains:\n\"If one does not cease, they become a **scourge to the world**—\nthough they may be executed, they are not **arrested** in their **non-action**.\"\n\n*The Master’s Commentary* states:\n\"Retreating a foot as a **guest**,\nnot contending with things—\nthough one may respond to hostility,\nit aligns with **actionless action**.\"\n\n*The Annotation* explains:\nHaving abandoned all **deliberate action**,\nand forgotten all **phenomenal perceptions**,\nthere is no **action** to be called **action**.\n\n**Brandishing arms without arms,**\n*The Annotation* explains:\n\"Though one might raise their arms in great anger,\nit is as if they had **no arms to brandish**.\"\n\n*The Chapter Explanation* states:\n\"Brandishing arms is meant to display anger,\nbut the virtuous warrior does not grow angry,\nso it

his outward form**.\nTreasuring jade means **illuminating his inner essence**.\nThus, few truly know me.\n\n*The Explication* says:\nThe Sage values **virtue and power** while despising his form—\nwearing skins and fur,\nembracing the **One** within,\nnot coveting office or rank,\nnurturing spirit and clarity within,\nrefining *qi* into jade,\nsolidifying essence into gold,\nthus able to

disease** does one **not fall ill**.\n*The Annotation* explains:\nOnly because the Sage **suffers from the disease of others’ forced knowledge**,\nhe does not **suffer himself**.\n\n*The Annotation* explains:\nThe Sage has no **flaw of knowledge**,\nwhile the common mind is **entangled in distinctions**—\nsuffering from the **disease of others’ disease**,\nthus he speaks to the vulgar, expounding teachings,\nhis intent to **rescue the drowning**.\nAlready **not ill yet ill**, **ill yet not ill**—\nhence it is said: **not ill**.\n\nThus, the Sage does not fall ill,\nbecause he **suffers from the disease of others**—\nthus he does not fall ill.\n\n*The Annotation* explains:\nThe Sage has no **disease of forced knowledge**,\nfor he **constantly suffers** with those who bear this disease,\nout of **compassion for them**—\nthus he does not suffer himself.\n\nThe Sage possesses **enlightened, penetrating wisdom**,\nyet **appears ignorant**,\nto make all under heaven **simple,

calamities**,\nthen **great calamities** shall come—\ngreat calamities being **death** itself.\nThose who fear it must **preserve their essence and nourish their spirit**,\n**align with Earth and receive from Heaven**.\n\n*The Annotated Commentary* elucidates:\n**\"Harm\"** means **punitive authority**—\nthe laws and prohibitions of all the scriptures.\n**Major harm** refers to the **three evil destinies**—\nthe cruel punishments of the **Northern Underworld (Tàlú and Lúchēng)**.\nIt speaks of how the **common folk**, unendured by scriptural precepts,\nwho **recklessly commit

**reside in deep mountains and vast marshes**,\nwhere one may **cultivate one’s nature**.\n\n**Lord Lu expounds:**\n**\"Do not narrow\"** means to **banish passions and discard desires**,\nso that

generated\"** is **the heart**.\n\nIt is said that those who cultivate the Dao must **settle the heart without attachments**, lest they **constrain it with narrow, inferior desires**, abandoning what they generate. Why? Though the body is **empty and illusory**, it is the **vessel for receiving the Dao**. One must neither **indulge in attachment** nor **reject with aversion**, for **indulgence clings to the realm of conditioned existence**, while **aversion drowns in the illusion of emptiness**. To **neither cling nor be defiled**, dwelling in the **Middle without dwelling in the Middle**—this is the **true practitioner of the Dao**.\n\nOnly **the one who does not satiate** is thus **unsatiated**.\n**Annotation:** Only the one who **does not satiate the spirit**—who **cleanses the heart of filth**, **discarding desires**—is **unsatiated by the spirit’s dwelling**.\n\n**Commentary:** The **domain of cultivation** is **neither existence nor emptiness**; thus, one **can cultivate it**. **Wisdom too** is **neither attached nor averse**; when **wisdom aligns with the domain**, it is **unsatiated**.\n\nThus, the **Sage knows himself**—\n**Annotation:** **Knowing one’s own gains and losses**.\n**without self-display**—\n**Annotation:** **Not revealing virtue externally**, but **concealing it within**.\n**Commentary:** When **wisdom aligns with the Dao’s domain**, one **penetrates the true source**, thus **knowing oneself**.

Therefore, **only those who do not cling to life** (独不以生为者) **can truly safeguard and honor those who do.**\n\n**Jiéjiě says:** This refers to **those who can mourn life before it is lost** (忧生於未生) and **guard form before it decays** (忧形於未形)—\n**only by contemplating non-action** (但念无为) and **abandoning artificiality** (舍自然) do they **attain true virtue and honor the Dao** (为贤贵道), **securing their own life** (安其生).\n\n**Now, the nature of human life is soft and frail** (人之生也柔弱).\n**Annotation:** When **humans are born, they are infused with harmonious qi** (含和气) and **embrace vital spirit** (抱精神), thus soft and frail.\n**Their death, however, is rigid and unyielding** (其死也坚强).\n**Annotation:** When **humans die, their harmonious qi is exhausted** (和气竭), and their **vital spirit departs** (精神亡), thus rigid and unyielding.\n\n**All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when they live** (万物草木之生也柔脆).\n**Annotation:** When **harmonious qi remains** (和气存也).\n**Their death, however, is withered and decayed** (其死也枯槁).\n**Annotation:** When **harmonious qi departs** (和气去也).\n**Commentary (疏):** When **life persists with its mandate** (生存有命), then **all limbs are soft and frail** (诸节柔弱). But **at death**, **bone and flesh become rigid and unyielding** (骨肉坚强).\n**Grasses and trees** are likewise—\n**when alive, they are pliable and tender** (生时软脆), but **when dead, their branches and trunks wither** (条柯枯槁). **This softness in life** (生而柔软者) **is because harmonious qi remains** (和气存也). **This rigidity in death** (死而坚强者) **is because harmonious qi departs** (和气离也).\n**This analogy serves to illustrate** (举此有识为辩) **the superiority and inferiority of things** (其胜劣者也).\n**Now, rigidity and unyielding are the marks of death** (夫坚强者死之徒), while **softness and frailty are the marks of life** (柔弱者生之徒).\n**Annotation:** Observing the **two precedents above**, it is clear—\n**rigidity and unyielding belong to death** (坚强者死), while **softness and frailty belong to life** (柔弱者生).\n**Commentary (疏):** *Tú* (徒) means **kindred or category** (类也). Thus, **those who act rigidly and forcefully** (行刚强者) **contradict the harmonious principle** (乖於和理), **and so align themselves with death** (故与死为徒). **Those who act softly and frailly** (行柔弱者) **conform to harmonious qi** (顺於和气), **and so align themselves with life** (故与生为徒).\n**This is a unified metaphor.**\n\n**Thus, strong armies do not prevail** (是以兵强则不胜).\n**Annotation:** Even **mighty armies** (强大之兵), **reckless in battle and delighting in slaughter** (轻战乐杀), **with poisonous flows and lingering grudges** (毒流怨结), **are ultimately undone when many weak stand as one** (众弱为一), **for their strength is their own undoing** (强故不胜).\n**Jiéjiě says:** *Army* (兵) here refers to **the mouth** (口)—\n**when the mouth is strong, it is exhausted by others** (口强为人所穷), and **when the yin is strong, it is overpowered by the female** (阴强为女所侵).\n**The Master responds:** *The softness of life* (生之柔弱) **is the fullness of harmonious qi** (和气全也). *The rigidity of death* (死之坚强) **is the dissipation of harmonious qi** (和气散也).\n**To clarify, guarding softness and frailty preserves life and extends years** (守柔弱者全生保年), while **acting rigidly and forcefully destroys the body and forfeits life** (为强梁者亡身失生).\n\n**When trees are rigid and strong, their branches and leaves are crushed** (木强则共).\n**Annotation:** When **trees are strong and robust** (木强大), their **branches and leaves are pressed beneath** (枝叶共生其上).\n**Commentary (疏):** *Army* (兵) here refers to **the three activities and six senses** (三业六根). **Those who indulge their passions** (纵恣六情), **forcefully dominate their surroundings** (强暴前境), and **consume without restraint** (食取无厌) **will inevitably suffer grave calamity and misfortune** (必遭重殃大祸), hence their defeat.\n**It is like a sturdy tree** (譬树木粗强), whose **branches are crushed beneath its own weight** (故枝条共压其上), or **like a grand beam** (亦犹梁栋宏壮), whose **rafters and tiles press down upon it** (故椽瓦压其上).\n**The strong are pressed low, while the weak rise high** (强大处下，柔弱处上).\n**Annotation:** When **constructing things or achieving feats**, **great trees are placed below** (大木处下), and **smaller things above** (小物处上). **This is the Dao of Heaven—suppressing the strong and elevating the weak** (天道抑强扶弱), **the natural order’s effect** (自然之效).\n**Jiéjiě says:** This refers to **the hair’s softness and frailty** (发以柔弱), **which is worn down by others** (为人所戴), and **the bones’ rigidity and strength** (体骨坚强), **which are labored upon by others** (为人所劳).\n**Commentary (疏):** The **rigid and strong trees dwell below** (坚强之木居下), while **the soft and weak branches ascend above** (柔弱之条处上). Thus, **the rigid and strong are consigned to the Nine Abysses below** (居九幽之下), and **the soft and weak are elevated to the Three Pure Ones above** (处三清之上).\n\n**Now, the Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow** (天之道，其犹张弓乎？).\n**Annotation:** The **Dao of Heaven is profound and distant** (天道杳邈), and **analogies are used to elucidate it** (举物类以为喻).\n**The Master responds:** The **Dao of Heaven is mysterious and far-reaching** (天道玄远), and **cannot be made clear without metaphor** (非喻不明), hence the **bow analogy to reveal its function** (举张弓以彰其用).\n**The high are pressed low, the low are lifted up** (高者抑之，下者举之), **the overabundant are diminished** (有余者损之), **and the insufficient are supplemented** (不足者与之).\n**Annotation:** This describes **the harmonious adjustment of drawing a bow** (言张弓和调之义如是), **only then can it be used.**\n**The Dao of Heaven presses the high and lifts the low** (天抑高举下), **diminishes the strong and supplements the weak** (损强益弱), **thus the Dao of Heaven** (天之道).\n**Commentary (疏):** To **lift the low and press the high** (举下使高，抑高令下), **both must be balanced** (高下调适), **only then can the arrow be released** (方可运箭). **The proud and arrogant, with excess** (傲慢有余者), **will inevitably meet ruin and defeat** (必招损败). **Those in harmony but lacking** (和不足者), **are granted fortune and goodness** (与其福善). **Thus the Dao of Heaven** (天道如是), **and it is likened to drawing a bow** (故似张弓).\n\n**The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency** (天之道，损有余补不足).\n**Annotation:** The **Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements the humble** (损有余而益谦), **for it always values moderation and harmony as supreme** (言天道常以中和为上).\n**Commentary (疏):** *Bestowing fortune upon the virtuous and calamity upon the licentious* (福善祸淫) is the **natural principle** (自然之理), **as previously expounded** (仍前生后). **This passage restates the same meaning.**\n\n**Now, human conduct is not so** (人之道则不然).\n**Annotation:** Human **conduct opposes the Dao of Heaven** (人道与天道反).\n**They diminish the deficient to enrich the excessive** (损不足，奉有余).\n**Annotation:** **Worldly folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich** (损贫以奉富), **plunder the weak to empower the strong** (夺弱以益强).\n**The Master responds:** The **Dao of Heaven applies evenhanded measures** (天道平施), **distributing surplus to the lacking** (裒多益寡), but **humans pervert Heaven’s ways** (人则违天), **flipping the principle of diminishing the deficient** (翻损不足者).\n**Commentary (疏):** In **human affairs**, **worldly conduct favors superficiality and deception** (好行浮伪), **pursuing trends and competing for gain** (趋势竞利). **This defies Heaven and contradicts nature** (违天背理), **plundering the deficient poor and lowly** (割损贫贱之不足) to **supply the excessive rich and noble** (供奉富贵之有余).\n\n「Who can have surplus to bestow upon the world, only those who embody the Dao. **Annotation:** It asks, who can occupy a position of surplus and, out of self-restraint, bestow upon the world’s deficient? Only a ruler who embodies the Dao can enact this.\n\nThe **Master responds:** The **Dao of Heaven** is evenhanded, yet the **virtue/power of the sage** does not accumulate. **Annotation:** The sage’s virtue/power is bestowed as benevolence, yet he does not rely upon or expect repayment. When his deeds are complete, he does not dwell in their fruits. **Annotation:** When his achievements are fulfilled, he does not claim their rewards.\n\n**Annotation:** The sage, by pushing his virtue/power outward and not dwelling in its results, does not wish to display his wisdom. **Annotation:** The sage’s reason for pushing his virtue/power outward and not dwelling in its results is to prevent others from recognizing his own wisdom.\n\n**Annotation:** The sage who embodies the Dao often rescues the world, yet though he bestows both wealth and virtue, he does not rely upon his own efforts. Even with great achievements, he does not dwell in their rewards, for his intent lies in humbly withdrawing himself, pushing virtue/power outward, concealing his brilliance and obscuring his traces, not wishing to display his own wisdom and ability.\n\nAmong all things in the world, none are as soft and weak as water, **Annotation:** Water is soft and weak—when contained, it is round; when shaped, it is square. If dammed, it stops; if released, it flows.\n\n**Annotation:** All things in the world differ in their nature, yet none are as soft and weak as water. By this, it illustrates the Dao’s gentle and yielding nature, its adaptability and capacity to nurture all things, like water permeating and nourishing everything.\n\nYet when it comes to overcoming hardness and strength, none can surpass it, **Annotation:** Water can erode mountains and topple ridges; it can wear down iron and dissolve bronze. Nothing can overcome water and achieve success.\n\n**Annotation:** Though water is soft and weak, its utility is boundless. It attacks and overcomes hardness and strength—none are more effective than it. This is because the Dao breaks through obstacles without force; its meaning is likewise.\n\n**Annotation:** Water is the inner essence, that is, the saliva in one’s mouth. When one rinses and swallows it, it can attack evil and dispel malice, penetrating to the marrow. Like the *qū bò* (麴蘗) that dissolves rice and medicinal herbs, nothing can surpass its efficacy.\n\n**Annotation:** In overcoming hardness and strength, nothing can replace water. **Annotation:** There is no substitute for water in overcoming hardness and strength.」\n\nThe Sovereign replied: *\"To attack strength with hardness, both hardnesses are damaged; to govern strength with softness, the strong are damaged while the soft remain intact. Thus, in overcoming hardness and strength, nothing can replace water.\"*\n\n**Annotation:** It is said that water can attack hardness—an unaltered principle across all ages. The Way of non-action overcoming existence is an unchanging art through the ages.\n\nThus, softness overcomes hardness, and weakness overcomes strength.\n**Annotation:** Water can extinguish fire; yin can consume yang.\nThe tongue is soft, the teeth are hard—yet the teeth perish before the tongue.\nNone in the world understand this,\n**Annotation:** Knowing that softness and weakness endure, while hardness and strength are broken.\nNone can act accordingly.\n**Annotation:** They shame humility and modesty, yet crave force and arrogance.\n\n**Annotation:** This refers to how a person, by containing essence and drinking qi, governs the blood and vital forces—common practice yet unrecognized by the masses.\n\n**Annotation:** Since water can attack metal and stone, it is known that softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength—a truth understood by both wise and foolish alike, yet no one in the world follows it.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n**Annotation:** Referring to serving those below.\n\nBearing the filth of the realm—this is called the steward of the ancestral altars.\n**Annotation:** A ruler who endures the impurities of the realm, like the sea that does not reject the tides, can long preserve the ancestral altars and become the sovereign of the land.\n**Annotation (御):** Drawing in the faults of all under heaven—this is bearing the realm’s filth. Calling oneself \"lonely and bereft\" (孤寡) and \"not the grain\" (不谷)—this is bearing the realm’s misfortunes. With such virtue, the ancestral altars are served, and thus all under heaven turn to him.\n\n**Annotation (疏):** *Guó* (国) refers to the domain of the state; *gòu* (垢) means disgrace. Those who embody the Dao in the world, humble and yielding, accommodating and compliant, enduring personal humiliation without contending with others, are fit to be stewards of the ancestral altars and shepherd the people.\n\n**Annotation (节解):** The human form’s left spirit (*arcan*) is the ancestral altar (*shè*), the right spirit (*pò*) is the grain altar (*jì*). Governing the vital breath (*yī qì*) makes one the sovereign.\n\nTo bear the realm’s misfortunes—this is called the King of all under heaven.\n**Annotation:** A ruler who takes upon himself the people’s faults and endures the calamities of misfortune can reign over all under heaven.\n**Annotation (节解):** The realm (*guó*) refers to the body. When breath enters the spleen, transforming dregs into essence and renewing the old with the new, nourishing the Five Spirits, it reigns over the viscera.\n\n**Annotation (疏):** *Bùxiáng* (不祥) means \"not good.\" The Sage’s discernment is vast and penetrating, knowing good and evil. If misfortune arises, he blames himself and takes the fault upon himself—this is worthy of ruling all under heaven. In ancient times, when King Tang said, *\"I cut down a thousand li to come,\"* this was his deed.\n\nEarlier, it was said that the ancestral altars could be entrusted to the feudal lords; now it is said that all under heaven should belong to the Son of Heaven. This is upright speech, though the world may take it as paradox.\n\n---\n\n**Annotation (节解):** The Way speaks of what common folk desire—purity and cleanliness as supreme, fragrance and beauty as highest—yet the Dao takes receiving filth as its master, dwelling in the low to rule. This is said to be contrary to the world.\n\n**Annotation (御):** Though the words appear contrary to common custom, why? The world loves beauty and honor, yet now it is said to receive filth and misfortune—thus it seems contrary. But *\"if\"* (若) is used to clarify that what is contrary is not fixed opposition: though it seems contrary, it is always in harmony with the Way. Though it appears contrary, it remains true, conforming to the world’s nature while transcending it. Though it seems contrary, it is not truly contrary—this is why *\"if\"* is added.\n\nEarlier, it was said that the **Way’s virtue** is profound and far-reaching, contrary to things, and then it attains great harmony—this is its meaning.\n\nTo reconcile great grievances,\n**Annotation (御):** *\"To reconcile\"* (和) means to harmonize. The greatest grievance against oneself is **emotional desire** (情欲). The ruler seeks to guide the people through speech, harmonizing their desires so that none remain—thus it is said, *\"To reconcile great grievances.\"*\n\nThere must be lingering grievances.\n**Annotation (御):** When laws are established, traces of governance remain, and these traces become grievances that affect the common people.\n**Annotation (疏):** Grievances are **discriminative perceptions** (慧). They are all **dharma** that awaits opposition—whether of existence or non-existence. Though one may discard the extremes of existence and non-existence, attain neither existence nor non-existence, and harmonize the two edges into the **middle path** (中一), one still clings to **emptiness** (玄), failing to penetrate its true essence. Though this is **non-attachment** (无待), it cannot fully escape **attachment** (不待). This is **selective attachment** (待独), not yet **absolute freedom** (独独)—thus lingering oppositions persist.\n\nHow can this be considered good?\n**Annotation (御):** If lingering grievances remain, it cannot be considered good.\n**Annotation (疏):** *\"How\"* (安) means *\"why.\"* Though one may discard the two extremes, one still clings to the middle—why can it not be fully good?\n\n**Annotation (节解):** This refers to the mouth. When one sings, there must be response. If people practice the Dao, the Dao will come to meet them. When one sings of goodness, the good will respond in harmony—then there will be no lingering grievances. But people of today indulge in **evil thoughts** (邪想). Evil thoughts follow them, and they call upon **evil spirits** (邪鬼). The spirits come to respond, and when one sings of evil, the evil harmonizes—how can such a thing be considered good?\n\nThus, the Sage holds the **left契** (left契),\n**Annotation (御):** The left契 is the **heart** (心). The heart is the **yang viscera** (阳藏), binding with the present realm (境) to establish trust—thus it is called the left契. The Sage knows that establishing guidance will inevitably leave traces, and traces will breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he upholds this heart, making it pure and tranquil, and transforms the people below, so that they have no desires. Without need for punishment or blame, the heart naturally aligns with **non-action** (无为).\n\n**Annotation (疏):** 契 is **trust** (信) and **harmony** (合). Left is **yang** (阳). The Sage’s heart, dwelling in **Dao/Way**, resonates with **wisdom** (智), in perfect accord. Through this, he can make all things harmonize, transcending the myriad faults. Thus, he attains the meaning of **longevity and eternal vision** (久视长生).\n\nTo hold the left契 is to not hold yet hold. Like an emperor grasping the left契, by which he governs all affairs, the Sage holds the **perfect契** within the cycle, thus able to guide the myriad multitudes. And when it is said that he does not blame, though he may guide all beings, he forgets their faults. The people are like **sacrificial dogs** (刍狗), and he does not blame them for their shortcomings.\n\n**Annotation (节解):** The left契 is **yang virtue** (阳德). The Sage does not reconcile great grievances but only cultivates his own virtue, never blaming others for their faults. Thus, the virtuous ruler governs through **trust and harmony** (司契), while the unvirtuous ruler governs through **traces and laws** (司彻).\n**Annotation (疏):** 司 means **to govern** (主), and 彻 means **traces** (迹). The Sage’s perfect契 does not cling to discriminative words. The unvirtuous ruler, however, remains stuck in the **nets of governance** (筌蹄), unable to fully transcend them. Since traces are not erased, it is said that he governs through **traces** (司彻).\n\n**Annotation (节解):** This refers to people practicing **moral cultivation** (行道德). The **Heavenly Command** (司命) bestows their **fate** (算). If people practice evil, the Command will **kill and destroy their records** (同杀彻其籍)—this is its meaning.\n\nThe **Heavenly Dao** has no favorites, always aligning with the good.\n**Annotation (疏):** The **natural principle** (天真) of the Dao knows no favoritism. Those of **highest virtue** (上善) naturally harmonize with it—just as before, the Sage held the left契 without blaming others.\n\n**Small realms, few people** (小国寡民).\n**Annotation (御):** Though the Sage may govern great realms, he still regards them as small, teaching **frugality** (俭约) and avoiding **extravagance** (奢泰). Though the people are many, they are treated as if few, not daring to burden or exploit them.\n\n**Annotation (疏):** Realm (国) is **domain** (域). The heart dwells in **emptiness** (空)—thus it is said *\"small realm.\"* This is the practice of **Hinayana** (小乘) and **few desires** (寡欲). Instruments (器) are the **weapons of the hundred** (什恶兵器). Though the six **roots** (根) exist, their use is **unexhausted** (不穷). When it is said *\"the hundred and the ten\"* (什伯), it refers to the greater numbers. *\"Not using\"* (不用) means **resting the roots** (息诸根), not staining them with the dust of the world.\n\n**Annotation (御):** 什 is **the five** (伍), and 伯 is **the great** (长). This chapter clarifies that people are **naturally harmonious** (含淳和), without seeking or demanding. When there are those whose talents and capacities fit to be **leaders of the five or the ten** (什伍伯长), they are still not **used** (用).\n\n「○**Jiéjiě** says: *\"Small realm\"* (小国) refers to the **body** (形), *\"the hundred and the ten\"* (什伯) refers to the **Five Zang Organs** (五藏).\nThe heart and kidneys are *\"the five\"* (什), the liver and lungs are *\"the great\"* (伯).\nWhen one **closes the mouth and cultivates the breath** (闭口行气), then the *\"hundred and the ten\"* (什伯) **qi** flourishes without **unnecessary use** (无不用).\n\nTo make the people **cherish death** (重死)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** If a ruler can **benefit the people and remove their harm** (兴利除害), allowing each to **find their rightful place** (得其所), then the people will **cherish death and hold life dear** (重死而贵生).\nAnd **not relocate far** (不远徙)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** If governance is **not burdensome** (不烦), then the people will **settle contentedly in their occupations** (各安其业).\nThus, they **do not move far** (不远迁徙), leaving their **usual dwellings** (常处).\n\n○**Yù** says: With **few thoughts and few desires** (少思寡欲), they **do not lightly expend their life** (不轻用其生), **devoting themselves to the root** (敦本) without **seeking anything** (无求), so they **do not relocate far** (故不远迁徙).\n\n○**Cù** says: All **actions** (诸行) are **heavy with stillness** (重静), **knowing contentment and abiding by their allotment** (守分), so they **attain their natural lifespan** (得终其天年) and **do not depart from their present realm** (不远遂前境).\n\nThough there are **vessels and conveyances** (舟舆), they **do not ride them** (无所乘之)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** In **purity and non-action** (清净无为), they **do not indulge in elaborate luxuries** (不作繁华) and **do not enjoy travel and recreation** (不好出入游娱).\n\n○**Cù** says: *\"Vessels and conveyances\"* (舟舆) refer to the **Three Yanas** (三乘教法).\nThe **boat** (舟) relies on **water** (水) to **ferry across** (济渡)—\nThis illustrates that **teachings** (教) are like a **boat navigating all beings** (舟航万物), **crossing the ocean of birth and death** (度於生死海).\nThus, the *Xīshēng Jīng* (《西升经》) states:\n*\"Long abandoned the sea of birth and death\"* (久旷生死海),\n*\"Cutting off the flow of greed and love\"* (隔绝贪爱流).\nThe **carriage** (舆) moves on **land** (陆) with **wheels** (轮转)—\nThis illustrates that **teachings** (教) can **transform the ordinary into the sacred** (转凡成圣), **achieving insight beyond words** (得理忘言).\nThus, they **dispense with teachings and do not rely on them** (能遣教而不用).\n\nThough there are **armor and weapons** (甲兵), they **do not deploy them** (无所陈之)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** They **harbor no resentment toward the world** (无怨恶於天下).\n\n○**Cù** says: Though one possesses **bodily and mental armor and weapons** (身心兵甲),\nIn the state of **\"sitting and forgetting\"** (车体坐忘),\nWith **external phenomena emptied** (物境既空),\nWhat need is there for **utterance or exposition** (陈说)?\nThis sentence **reverses and clarifies** the earlier *\"the hundred and the ten\"* (什伯) **instruments unused** (之器而不用).\n\nTo make the people **return to knotting cords** (复结绳) and **employ them** (而用之)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** To **abandon culture and return to simplicity** (弃文反质), **keeping faith without deceit** (信不欺).\n\n○**Yù** says: *\"Vessels and conveyances\"* (舟舆) are meant for **relocation** (利迁徙),\n*\"Armor and weapons\"* (甲兵) are meant for **waging war** (徇攻战).\nSince both are **unwanted** (无欲),\nThey **do not ride or deploy them** (故无所乘陈).\nReturning to **primordial simplicity** (反朴还淳),\nThey **revert to the use of the Three Sovereigns** (归於三皇结绳之用).\n\n○**Jiéjiě** says: This means that **Dao/Way-qi** (道气) **naturally flows and functions** (自流行),\nAs **bodily use** (形中之用),\nLike the **trustworthiness of knotted cords** (结绳之信).\n\n○**Cù** says: Having **emptied the heart and verified the principle** (虚心证理),\n**Discarding teachings and forgetting the raft** (舍教忘筌),\nThey **resort to knotted cords** (寄结绳),\n**Showing their return to the origin** (示其反本).\nThis sentence **repeats the earlier theme** of *\"though there are vessels and conveyances, they do not ride them\"* (虽有舟舆无所乘).\n\n**Simple food** (甘其食)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** To **enjoy simple nourishment** (甘其蔬养), **not plundering the people** (不渔食百姓).\n\n○**Cù** says: **Taste is the Dao/Way** (味至道).\n**Beautiful attire** (美其服)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** To **adorn simple garments** (美其恶衣), **not valuing the five colors** (不贵五色).\n\n○**Cù** says: **Virtue/power shines through the body** (德莹身).\n○**Jiéjiě** says: This means to **find sweetness in the qi of food** (甘食其气),\nAnd **beauty in the Dao/Way of attire** (美服其道).\n\n**Peaceful dwelling** (安其居)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** To **settle in humble thatched homes** (安其茅茨之居),\n**Not favoring ornate dwellings** (不好文饰之屋).\n\n○**Cù** says: **All places are peaceful** (所在皆安), **stillness in motion** (动而寂).\n\n**To delight in their customs** (乐其俗)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** To **rejoice in simplicity and authenticity** (乐其质朴之俗),\n**Not altering them** (不转移).\n\n○**Cù** says: **Harmonizing with the world** (和光人世),\n**Stillness in motion** (寂而动).\n\n○**Jiéjiě** says: This means to **settle the body and delight the spirit** (安形乐神),\n**Singing while embracing the belly** (抱腹而歌吟).\n\n**Neighboring realms are visible** (邻国相望), **the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard** (鸡狗之声相闻)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** They are **nearby** (相去近).\n\n○**Cù** says: The **chicken** (鸡) **marks the dawn** (司晨),\nThe **dog** (狗) **wards off night** (警夜)—\nThis illustrates that **all teachings** (一切言教)\n**Alert to the long night of ignorance** (警长昏之夜),\n**Awaken the dawn of wisdom** (思智慧之晨).\nThis **teaching** (言教) **is close to realizing the One Mind** (近证一心),\nThus it is said that their **sounds are heard** (故言相闻).\n\n**The people do not interact until old age** (民至老不相往来)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** They **lack emotional attachments** (其无情欲).\n\n○**Jiéjiě** says: *\"Neighboring realms\"* (邻国) are the **two ears** (两耳).\nThe **two ears** (两耳) **face each other** (相望),\n**Preserving their tranquility** (保其安).\nThey **guard their spirit-qi** (使神气各有所守),\n**Not interfering with one another** (不来往相干),\nThus **even in old age, they remain keen** (故至老常能聪明).\n\n○**Cù** says: **Uniting with principle and embodying truth** (会理体真),\n**The common is the Dao/Way, the Dao/Way is common** (即俗即道),\n**Not coming from the realm of birth and death** (不从生死而来),\nNor **going toward any realm of the Dao/Way** (亦无道境可往).\nWith **the two domains as one** (二域既一),\nThey **do not

ornate\"* (不美) means **simple and unadorned** (朴且质).\n\n○**Yù** says: *\"True words\"* (信言) are **sacred teachings** (圣教).\n**Honest and true words** (信实之言),\n**Do not exceed the common** (不出於俗),\nThus they are **not ornate** (故不美).\n\n**Ornate words are not true** (美言不信)—\n**Annotation (Zhù):** *\"Ornate words\"* (美言) are **embellished speech** (滋美之华辞).\n*\"Not true\"* (不信) means **decorative and full of emptiness** (饰伪多空虚).\n\n○**Yù** says: *\"Ornate words\"* (美言) are **worldly teachings** (世教).\n**Sweet and beautiful words** (甘美之言),\n**Align with the common** (动合於俗),\nThus they are **not true** (故不信).\n\n○**Cù** says: **Truth** (信) is **reality** (实).\n**Ornate** (美) is **superficial and gaudy** (浮艳).\nThose of **highest virtue/power** (上德之人),\n**Dwelling in true

      "translated_text": "**Daoist Classic of the *Dao De Jing* with Commentary**\n**Title:** *Dao De Jing* with Commentary\n**Original Attribution:** Attributed to Master Gu Xuan of Wu Commandery, though likely composed by a Song-era scholar.\n**Eight volumes.**\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngshén Bù* (Mystic Treasures Section), *Yùjué Lèi* (Jade Precepts Category); Supplementary: Dunhuang fragment S.4430.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of the *Dao De Jing* with Commentary**\n**Narrated by the Wu Commandery recluse Gu Xuan**\n\n**Chapter 1: The Dao that Can Be Spoken of**\n**Commentary:** This refers to the Dao as expounded in the *Jing* for the cultivation of political and religious teachings.\n\n**The Dao that Cannot Be Spoken of**\n**Commentary:** This is not the Dao of natural longevity and immortality.\n\n**The True Dao** (that cannot be spoken of) is to:\n- Nourish the spirit with non-action (*wúwéi*),\n- Keep the people at ease without affairs (*wúshì*),\n- Hold the luminous within and conceal its brilliance (*hán guāng cáng huī*),\n- Erase one’s traces and obscure one’s origin (*miè jì nì duān*),—\nso profound it cannot be named or described.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe term *Dao* signifies the principle of emptiness and fluidity (*xūtōng*), while *cháng* denotes the state of profound stillness (*zhànjì*). The **Dao of the Boundless** is the innate nature (*zhèngxìng*) of all beings. When it speaks of \"the Dao that can be spoken of,\" it refers to **named teachings**—the methods that can be articulated.\n\nThough it may be called \"the Dao that can be spoken of,\" one must adapt to circumstances (*suí jī qiè dàng*) and speak accordingly, yet it remains merely a manifestation of sound and discourse (*yǒu shēng yǒu shuō*), not the **true, immutable, and eternally still Dao**.\n\nThe **True Dao** transcends named teachings and cannot be grasped by thought or reasoning (*bùkě míngyán biàn*). Its subtlety is unparalleled (*miào zhuó xīyí*), its essence elusive to the point of bewilderment (*lǐ qióng huǎnghū*). Thus, only beyond the realm of words and symbols (*zhī yán xiàng zhī biǎo*) does one truly align with the **Dao of immutable stillness**.\n\nWhat can be spoken of and named is the **Dao that is not the True Dao**.\n\n**The Name that Can Be Named**\n**Commentary:** This refers to the **names of wealth, honor, and worldly eminence** (*fùguì zūnróng gāoshì zhī míng*).\n\n**The Name that Cannot Be Named**\n**Commentary:** This is not the **name of natural, eternal permanence**.\n\nThe **True Name** (that cannot be named) should be like:\n- The infant’s unspoken innocence (*yīngxiōng zhī wèiyán*),\n- The undivided egg (*jīzǐ zhī wèifēn*),\n- The pearl still within the oyster (*míngzhū zài bàng zhōng*),\n- The gemstone hidden in stone (*měiyù chǔ shíwèn*),—\nwhere its inner radiance is clear (*zhāozhāo*), yet its outer appearance is dull as ignorance (*wài rú wán yú*).\n\n**Exegesis:**\n**Name** is **teaching** (*jiào*). Earlier, the Dao that can be spoken of was expounded with utmost clarity (*shèng míng yú lǐ*). Now, the Name that can be named is a secondary revelation through teaching (*cì xiǎn yú jiào*). Since the True Dao transcends words and symbols, and even teaching surpasses mere discourse (*shuōshì*), the essence of the Dao and its teachings are **one without distinction** (*bùyī bùyì*).\n\nYet the **Supreme Dao** is too profound to measure (*bùkě yá liàng*), neither void nor existent (*fēiwú fēiyǒu*), neither fixed nor eternal (*bùduàn bùcháng*), yet it holds **nuanced distinctions** (*yì yǒu yìyáng*), and **teaching** accommodates both gradual and sudden methods (*jiào cún jiàndùn*). Thus, the True Dao is posited to transcend what can be named, hence the statement: *\"The Dao that can be named is not the True Dao.\"*\n\nWhen discourse reaches its utmost, it rests in **the realm of neither naming nor not naming** (*wúkě wúbùkě*). Therefore, the *Yùjīng Jing* (Jade Capital Scripture) states:\n*\"Neither naming nor not naming, thought merges with the subtlest essence.\"*\n\n**The Nameless**\n**Commentary:** The **Nameless** refers to the **Dao itself**, which has no form and thus cannot be named. **The Beginning** signifies the Dao’s emission of *qi* and manifestation of transformation (*tǔqì bùhuà*), arising from the **Void** (*xūwú*) as the primordial source of heaven and earth.\n\n**Exegesis by Master Wang:**\nThough the Dao is **Nameless**, it yet **emits *qi* and manifests transformation**, emerging from the **Void** to become the **origin of heaven, earth, and all things**.\n\n**Exegesis:**\n**The Beginning** is the **Source** (*běn*). The **Void and Nameless Dao** molds and refines all things (*táoyǒng zhōngwàn wù*), from the **Two Poles** (*èr yún*) to the **Three Manifestations** (*sān jǐng*), all deriving from it. Thus, the **Nameless** is the **root of all things**, and though it can be spoken of, its clarity is evident.\n\n**The Named**\n**Commentary:** The **Named** refers to **heaven and earth**, which possess form, position, yin and yang, and softness and hardness—these are their **Names**.\n\nThe **Mother of All Things** is heaven and earth, which contain *qi* and give birth to all things, nurturing them to growth and maturity, like a mother rearing her child.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe **Mother** has **form and traces** (*yǒu míng jì*). The **Dao of the Profound Void** originates as the **Nameless**, yet descending from its source, names and distinctions arise. Thus, the Sage establishes the **Named** to elucidate the **Nameless**, desiring to **nurture beings back to their origin**—through compassion and care (*cíbēi jūyǎng*), akin to a mother’s role.\n\n**Master Gu states:**\nThe **Named** refers to **yin and yang**, while the **Nameless** is the **True Dao**. The True Dao has no substance (*wú tǐ*), hence it is **Nameless**. Yin and yang are differentiated (*yǒu fēn*), hence they are **Named**.\n\n**The Beginning** is taken from its **timelessness** (*wú xiān*), while **Mother** is taken from its **function** (*yǒu gōng*). Timelessness renders the origin unsearchable (*běn bùkě xún*), while function makes its principle explicable (*qí lǐ kě shuō*). For yin and yang contain *qi* and give birth to all things, nurturing them to growth and maturity—like a mother rearing her child—hence they are called **Mother**.\n\n**Constantly without desire, one observes its subtlety.**\n**Commentary:** *Miao* means **essential unity** (*yào*). When one constantly remains without desire (*wú yù*), one can perceive the **core principle** of the Great Dao.\n\n**Essential unity** is **oneness** (*yī*), which issues forth and manifests transformation (*míng dào zàn shū*), distinguishing right and wrong (*míng shìfēi*).\n\n**Exegesis by Jiéshuò:**\nThis refers to **preserving the Void** (*shǒu xūwú*).\n\n**Exegesis:**\n*Miao* means **profound and refined** (*jīngwēi*). **Observation** is **illumination and scrutiny** (*zhào chá*). **Its** refers to **oneself** (*jǐ*). When one constantly remains without desire or action (*wú yù wúwéi*), in **absolute emptiness and stillness** (*zhì xū zhì jìng*), one can then **discern the subtleties of one’s own Dao** and **perceive the refined essence of ultimate principle**.\n\n**Constantly with desire, one observes its return.**\n**Commentary:** *Jiǎo* means **alignment** (*guī*). Those who constantly harbor desire (*yǒu yù*) can observe the **tendencies of the worldly realm**.\n\n**Master Yu states:**\nHumans are born in stillness (*jīng*), which is the **nature of Heaven**. When stirred by things (*gǎn wù*), they move—this is the **desire of nature**. If one constantly upholds **purity and stillness**, releases the mind and frees the spirit (*jiěxīn shìshén*), and reflects back upon one’s true nature (*fǎn zhào zhèngxìng*), then one observes the **refined origin**.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nWhen one cannot remain in **non-action and serenity** (*wúwéi tiándàn*), fails to **guard the refined and uphold the true**, but instead **arises with greed and indulges in worldly attachments** (*wàngqǐ tānqiú, sìqíng rǎnzhì*), one merely sees the **existence of worldly conditions** (*shìjìng zhī yǒu*), yet does not grasp the **emptiness of immediate existence** (*jìyǒu zhī kōng*). Thus, one fails to perceive the **refined essence of the Dao** and only witnesses the **alignment toward life and death**.\n\nEarlier, the distinction between the **Nameless and Named** was clarified; now, the **superiority of those without desire over those with desire** is revealed.\n\n**Master Zhang states:**\nThe **highest attainments** (*shàng dá zhī rén*) take and discard with equanimity (*qíngyí*), maintaining **purity and emptiness without desire** (*qīngxū wúyù*). Their **spirit and emotions** are illuminated and scrutinized (*shénqíng zhào chá*), thus they attain the **subtleties of the Dao**.\n\n**The two aspects** (of desire and non-desire) **emerge from the same source yet bear different names.**\n**Commentary:** The **two aspects** refer to **those with and without desire** (*yǒu yù wúyù*). **Same source** means they both arise from **human nature** (*tóng chū rén zhī xīn*). **Different names** signifies their **distinct outcomes** (*suǒ míng gèyì*).",

      "translated_text": "「○Commentary: When one looks back from today to the past, today exists because of the past; when one looks forward from the past to today, the past is named because of today. Yet today is not truly today—how could it give rise to the past? The past is not truly the past—how could it give rise to today? Since there is neither past nor present, what is before or after? Thus, it is known that though there are before and after, the three times follow one another yet have no ultimate substance.\n\n○Master Wang said: Beginning and end pursue each other, never far apart—like accumulating virtue yields blessings, accumulating vice invites calamity. Good and evil act in the present, while fortune and misfortune follow in their wake.\n\nThus, the Sage governs through *wuwei* (non-action).\n**Note:** Governance through the Dao.\n**Explanation:** This means naturalness.\n\n○Commentary: The Sage is one who embodies the Dao and aligns with the True. \"Sage\" also means \"rectified\"—able to rectify oneself and, in turn, others. Therefore, they are called Sage. This Sage, with compassion and mercy, rescues all beings, upholding the wondrous law of *wuwei* to govern the desiring masses. The governance is near—referring to the ability to govern mentioned earlier, which belongs to the Sage. Continuing from before, it states: Thus, the Sage governs through *wuwei*, being still yet active, active yet still, still yet active, and through *wuwei* yet able to act.\n\nActive yet still—this means, in the world, not abandoning *wuwei*. Thus, *wuwei* is indeed action, and action is indeed *wuwei*. How could there be distinctions between marketplace and mountain valley, or separations between bowing in silence and governing the world? Hence, it is said to govern through *wuwei*.\n\nPracticing the teaching of *wu* (non-speech);\n**Note:** Leading by personal example.\n\n○Commentary: The wondrous embodiment of the True Source transcends speech and form. Though dwelling in stillness, its transformations are boundless. Not only does the True not contradict response, but speech does not hinder silence. Having emerged from speech and silence, their essence is one. Silent and composed, yet filling the world with influence—how could one say the Sage \"does not speak\" by sealing the lips? Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"One who speaks sufficiently can speak all day and exhaust the Dao; one who speaks insufficiently can speak all day and exhaust things.\"*\n\nAll things arise,\n**Note:** Each moves spontaneously.\nyet without complaint.\n**Note:** Not repelling or obstructing.\n\n○Commentary: All things are all living beings. *Action* means response and movement. *Beginning* means first. The Sage, without intention, responds to stimuli—like a clear mirror or an empty valley. Responding only after being moved, not acting before things, hence *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Ever harmonious yet never leading.\"*\n\nBringing forth yet not possessing,\n**Note:** The Original Qi gives rise to all things yet does not possess them.\nacting yet not relying,\n**Note:** The Dao’s actions are not done with expectation of reward.\n\n○Commentary: *Relying* means depending on. The great Sage, with an empty heart, seizes opportunities to benefit beings, treating self and others equally, forgetting both self and others. Though achieving great deeds, they never depend on them, forgetting their accomplishments.\n\nWhen deeds are complete, they do not dwell upon them.\n**Note:** When deeds are done and affairs settled, they withdraw, not claiming position.\n\n○Commentary: Covering and nourishing all things, their deeds reach heaven and earth, illuminating the people with brilliance surpassing the sun and moon—yet they attribute their deeds to others, not dwelling in their virtue.\n\nOnly because they do not dwell upon it,\n**Note:** Only because their deeds are complete and they do not claim position,\nis it that it does not depart from them.\n**Note:** Their blessings and virtue remain ever-present.\n\nThis speaks of the Sage’s non-action, which cannot be followed; their non-speech, which cannot be known. The previous six lines—high and low, long and short—Master Wang opens one source, from which a hundred branches arise. The transformations of these hundred branches never fail to bring chaos.\n\n○Commentary: *Fu* marks the beginning of speech; *wei* emphasizes uniqueness. Only the Sage creates and transforms heaven and earth, nurtures all sentient beings, achieves great deeds, yet attributes them to others. Who but the Sage could do this? Because they recognize their deeds, their great deeds are ever distant, their Sage virtue ever present—thus it does not depart.\n\nNot elevating the worthy,\n**Note:** The \"worthy\" refers to worldly scholars—eloquent in speech, skilled in texts, yet detached from the Dao, prioritizing form over substance.\n\nNot elevating means not honoring them with rank or office.\n**Explanation:** Master Wang says: Elevating the worthy creates distinctions; following distinctions sparks contention. Thus, the people do not contend.\n\n**Note:** Not contending over fame and position, returning to naturalness.\n\n○Commentary: This does not mean the ruler does not value the worthy. It is that people practice humility, placing others before themselves, not exalting themselves while belittling others. Speaking of \"not contending\"—if everyone exalts themselves while belittling others, then vain competition flourishes. If all retreat from self and prioritize others, then contention naturally ceases.\n\nNot treasuring difficult-to-obtain goods,\n**Note:** The ruler does not hoard treasures—gold abandoned in mountains, pearls cast into abysses.\n\nThus, the people do not steal;\n**Note:** The ruler’s purity descends, so the people have no desire for noble things.\n\n**Explanation:** This means evil *qi* does not arise, thieves do not enter. A single firm grasp dispels evil *qi*.\n\n○Commentary: Difficult-to-obtain goods refer to treasures like Zhao pearls and Jing jade. If treasures are universally prized, thieves will arise. If treasures are universally despised, petty thefts will not occur. Hence, it is said there is no theft.\n\nNot seeing what is desirable,\n**Note:** Banishing *Zheng* music, distancing flatterers.\n\n**Explanation:** This means *wuwei*.\n\nThus, the heart does not become disordered.\n**Note:** No licentiousness.\n\n**Explanation:** Ever maintaining the One.\n\n○Commentary: What is desirable refers to worldly sights and sounds—objects of greed and attachment. The Sage does not see them—not because they block the ears, but because the wondrous embodiment perceives the emptiness of dust and phenomena, finding no true desirable objects. Exhausting the roots of dust, they do not align, hence no desire arises. Since there are no desirable objects, the ears and eyes wander freely, yet the heart remains ever empty and still. Thus, it is said the heart does not become disordered.\n\nHence, the *Xisheng Jing* says: *\"Like shadows in a mirror—visible yet untouchable.\"* It also says: *\"To see is to see nothing; to listen is to hear nothing.\"* The previous statements on non-contention and non-theft are specific; this statement on not seeing what is desirable is comprehensive, dispelling the three activities and all phenomena. It solely reveals the Sage’s empty heart benefiting beings.",

      "translated_text": "「#2 **Qi/Godly Spirit***: Originally written as *shēn* (a variant of *shén*), corrected to *shén* (Godly Spirit), based on the Tang Dynasty Emperor Xuanzong’s imperial annotation of the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Exegesis* from the Daoist Canon.\n\n**Volume Two of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Exegesis**\n*Narrated by the Wuyun recluse Gu Xuan*\n\nFive colors blind the eyes,\n*[Note:]* Indulgence in lustful desires and vibrant hues consumes vital essence, dims clarity, and prevents one from perceiving the formless *color*—thus, the eyes grow blind.\n\n**[Node Solution]:** It does not mean the eyes are physically blind, but that one’s own vision is obscured. Though they see only the *xuányuán* (the primal yellow of the cosmos) and the *jūyù* (jade-like radiance of the Dao), the brilliance of the Godly Spirit is lost, and the five colors’ dazzling glare obscures all else—so the eyes are blind.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black.\nIt states that one cannot internally illuminate the true source of existence, yet externally pursues fleeting sensory realms. Though they see the illusory colors of the world, they remain unaware of the formless *color*—so what difference is there between blindness and this?\n\nFive tones deafen the ears,\n*[Note:]* Delight in the five tones scatters harmonious *qi*, preventing one from hearing the soundless *sound*—thus, the ears grow deaf.\n\n**[Node Solution]:** It does not mean the ears are physically deaf, but that one’s own hearing is dulled. Though they hear only the clamor of bells and drums, they fail to perceive the Godly Spirit’s voice—so it is called deafness of the ears.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The five tones are *gōng* (yellow bell), *shāng* (major second), *jué* (minor third), *zhǐ* (major fourth), and *yǔ* (major fifth).\nWhen the mind indulges in strings and pipes, the ears become clogged by the five tones, unable to return and listen to the subtle *sound* of the Dao—so it is called deafness.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: It is not only the body that has blindness and deafness, but the mind as well.\n\n**[Wang Bi’s Commentary]:** If one is ensnared by them, then licentious sounds will harm the Godly Spirit and disrupt the true nature. When one’s speech is filled with lamentation and sorrow, it is the same as being deaf.\n\n**[Gu Xuan and Shi Le’s Commentary]:** Though they hear only discordant clamor, it is still called not being deaf—yet they fail to recognize that the true nature of sound is emptiness, and thus are no different from the deaf.\n\nFive flavors make the mouth insensible,\n*[Note:]* *Shuāng* (insensible) is the same as *wáng* (lost).\nIndulgence in the five flavors leads to reckless speech, straying from the Dao.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The five flavors are sweet, bitter, sour, pungent, and salty.\n*Shuāng* means deviation and loss. When one indulges in rich delicacies and savors the rank, they cannot taste the Dao’s essence or discuss its mysteries—so it is called insensibility of the mouth.\n\nThose who indulge in reckless pursuits and hunting,\nTheir minds grow deranged.\n\n*[Note:]* The human spirit prefers tranquility; if one gallops and breathes wildly, the spirit scatters and dissipates—so the mind grows deranged.\n\n**[Node Solution]:** It refers to the dead returning to the earth, their kin lamenting in sorrow, while the living rush about in haste, weeping and wailing. The departed are buried in tombs, the living scatter in the fields, the close kin are deranged with grief, the distant kin are sorrowful—so it is said that their minds grow deranged.\n\n**[Imperial Annotation]:** Those who chase after worldly affairs, clinging to artificial actions, like hunters who seek only to slay, wage daily battles with their minds, racing after sensory realms—when they pause to reflect, they are struck by madness.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** *Chíchéng* (reckless pursuits) is akin to *zǒuzòu* (rushing about). Hunters, driven by greed, chase after beasts, their hearts wild and unrestrained—like madmen. Those who invert the Dao’s principles, their desires chase after sensory realms, swift as galloping steeds, their minds as deranged as hunters.\n\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: There are five ways to lose one’s true nature—one of which is when the five colors blind the eyes, preventing them from seeing clearly.\n\nHard-to-obtain treasures bring hindrance to one’s conduct.\n*[Note:]* *Fáng* (hindrance) is the same as *shāng* (harm).\nHard-to-obtain treasures—such as the *Zhào Bì* (Bi of Zhao) and *Suí Zhū* (Pearl of Suí), precious gold, silver, jade, and pearls—when one’s heart covets them and their mind desires them without knowing contentment, then their conduct brings harm to their body and disgrace to their name.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Fine and beautiful things, when one clings to and indulges in them, become the cause of birth and death. Within the path of cultivating the Dao, they greatly obstruct progress.\nThus, the Sage holds to the *fù* (abdomen),\n*[Note:]* Guarding the five *xìng* (nature/essence), eliminating the six *qíng* (emotions), moderating the *zhìqì* (intentional *qi*), and nurturing the Godly Spirit.\n\nAnd does not indulge the eyes,\n*[Note:]* The eyes should not gaze wantonly, for wanton gazing scatters vital essence outward.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Thus, following the previous text—\nThe Sage embodies the sacred precepts: whatever is within the abdomen, whatever is external to the eyes, they embrace the Dao and cultivate its *virtue/power*, filling their inner being. Therefore, they hold to the abdomen.\nInternally, they perceive the formless *color*; they return to listen to the soundless *sound*. All sensory faculties are empty and pure, untouched by dusty realms—so they do not indulge the eyes.\n\nThus, they abandon the former and take the latter.\n*[Note:]* Abandoning the eyes’ wanton gazing, taking the abdomen’s nurturing of the Godly Spirit.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Abandoning the ears and eyes’ blindness and deafness, taking the abdomen’s true wisdom.\n\nFavor and disgrace are like sudden alarm,\n*[Note:]* Both receiving honor and enduring humiliation bring alarm.\n\n**[Imperial Annotation]:** When one clings to them, they are filled with dread; when one is bound by them, they are filled with sorrow. Not having set their minds to honor or disgrace, they are both alarming.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Favor refers to the name of glory and love; disgrace refers to the shame of punishment. *Ruò* (like) means *as*; *jīng* (alarm) means *fear*.\nWhen one receives favor, they grow idle and joyful; when one suffers disgrace, they are startled and troubled in spirit—so receiving favor fills the heart with alarming joy, while enduring disgrace fills the heart with alarming dread.\nThough joy and fear differ, they are both forms of alarm—so it is said that they are like alarm.\n\nYet the emotions of joy and fear are not the true nature—so those who attain the Dao liken poverty and wealth to the cold and heat of the seasons, compare honor and disgrace to the coming and going of fortune, and remain unshaken by death and life—what then is the power of honor and disgrace to alarm them?\n\nGreat misfortune is like the body itself.\n*[Note:]* *Guì* (great) means *fear*; *ruò* (like) means *until*.\nOne fears great misfortune until it reaches the body—so it is alarming.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Great refers to noble rank, but also to one who forgets their body in their own nobility. It refers to afflictions such as worries, old age, and illness.\nCommon people only know to boast of their own bodies, yet fear great misfortune—unaware that great misfortune is their very body. They seek nourishment and sustenance, yet ultimately return to decay and ruin. So to fear the body is to fear great misfortune, and to fear great misfortune is to fear the body—both are rooted in the body itself.\n\n**[Cai’s Commentary]:** Those who cling to the body are attached to their own form, unable to let go or forget. They worry over their body’s labor, fear its hunger and cold, and ponder its decay—this is great misfortune. Thus, it is known that clinging to existence brings suffering, and preserving the body is the root of all misfortune. Those who fear their own body are no different from those who fear great misfortune.»",

Why? Because gaining honor brings startled joy, losing it brings startled dread—both shocks stem from the same *honor*, hence it is lowly.\n\nThis is called *\"honor and disgrace as shock.\"*\n\n**Note:** Explaining *\"to gain it is like a shock, to lose it is like a shock.\"*\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:** Honor and disgrace cycle—honor is the root of disgrace.\nOrdinary minds are deluded, shocked by disgrace yet not by honor.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"fearing great misfortune as the body\"*?\n**Note:** Returning to self-inquiry—why fear great misfortune as the body?\nMy great misfortune arises because I have a body.\n**Note:** My great misfortune comes from having a body—\nto labor over it, to fear hunger and cold,\nto indulge emotions and desires—\nthus inviting calamity.\n\n**Cushion:** This answers the prior question.\nClinging to the body, unable to forget it,\nworrying over its labor, its hunger, its cold—\nthis is great misfortune.\nThus, those who prize the body are no different from those who prize misfortune.\n\nHence the *Xi Sheng Jing* says:\n*\"The body is the root of affliction—pain, itch, cold, and heat—\nI am bound by the body, knowing it as great misfortune—\nthis is its reality.*\nWhen I have no body, what misfortune do I have?\n**Note:** If I have no body, attaining the Dao naturally,\nlightly ascending to the clouds, entering and exiting without hindrance,\ncommuning with the Dao and spirits—\nwhat misfortune could there be?\n\n**Yu’s Commentary:** If one knows that heaven and earth harmonize without being mine,\ndetaching from form and discarding intellect,\nrealizing the body is not the body,\nuniting with the Great Way—\nwhat misfortune could there be?\n\n**Jie’s Explanation:** Forgetting the body to nourish the spirit is called *\"no body.\"*\n\n**Cushion:** *\"No\"* here means *sitting-forgetfulness*, losing the self,\nenjoying the body while detached from form—\nthus the body has no body,\nnot annihilation but transcendence.\n\nThus, those who prize the body as the world’s master\nmay temporarily rely on the world,\n**Note:** Those who exalt their body while belittling others,\ndesiring to rule the world,\ncan establish themselves but not endure.\n**Cushion:** Unaware that the body is great misfortune,\nthey cling to it, exalting themselves,\nalways seeking to dominate others—\nsuch people may briefly dwell in the world\nbut cannot long govern it.\n\nThose who love the body as the world’s master\nmay truly entrust themselves to the world.\n**Note:** Those who love their body not for themselves\nbut as parents to all people—\nif a ruler governs with this virtue,\nthey may entrust their body to the people above,\nenduring without blame.\n\n**Cushion:** *Rely* means temporary dwelling;\n*entrust* means enduring commitment—\nspeaking of preserving and cherishing the body without reckless indulgence.\nWith humility to govern oneself,\nyielding and following others,\nthey may transform and entrust themselves to the world—\nhence the *De Jing* says: *\"Love yourself but do not exalt yourself.\"*\n\nThat which cannot be seen is called *yi*,\n**Note:** *Yi*—without color—\nspeaking of absolute uniformity,\nunable to be perceived by sight.\n**Cushion:** *Yi* means level—\nthe Dao’s subtlety cannot be grasped by the five colors,\nhence it cannot be seen.\nIf it had color, it would be uneven—\nonly without color is it perfectly level.\n\nThat which cannot be heard is called *xi*,\n**Note:** *Xi*—without sound—\nspeaking of absolute silence,\nunable to be perceived by hearing.\n**Cushion:** *Xi* means sparse—\nits essence is not the five tones,\nhence it cannot be heard by the ear.\n\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *wei*.\n**Note:** *Wei*—without form—\nspeaking of absolute formlessness,\nunable to be held or touched.\n**Yu’s Commentary:** *Wei* means subtle.\nThe Dao has no shape, hence cannot be grasped.\nYet within its formlessness, it manifests—\nthus it is called *wei*.\n\n**Cushion:** *Wei* means subtle—\nits essence is not material,\nhence cannot be touched or held.\n\n**Zang’s Commentary:** When speaking of *yi, xi, wei*,\nit refers to *jing, shen,* and *qi*—\n*jing* is the name for luminous wisdom,\n*shen* is the name for unfathomable function,\n*qi* is the name for form and appearance—\nthese three are unified as one.\n\nThe Sage does not see this *jing*,\ndoes not hear this *shen*,\ndoes not grasp this *qi*.\nSince it cannot be seen, heard, or grasped,\nit should be called *without color, without sound, without form*—\nyet why speak of *yi, xi, wei*?\n\nThe Supreme Dao, though called *without color*,\nis not utterly nonexistent—\nif utterly nonexistent, it would be like the Great Void,\nleading to nihilistic views.\nNow it is clarified:\n*Without color yet colored*,\n*without sound yet sounding*,\n*without form yet forming*—\nhence it is called *yi, xi, wei*.",

      "translated_text": "The text is insufficient in its teachings.\n**Explication:** It is insufficient because the teachings cannot guide the people.\n\n○**Shu says:** These three matters refer to the three prior absolutions. This text is a sudden teaching of the Great Vehicle, the study of the superior ones, whose principles are profound and distant, insufficient to instruct those of lower capacity. Therefore, it is ordered to have its proper associations.\n\n**Explication:** As in the following sentence.\n\n○**Yu says:** These three matters merely require abandonment; they do not yet demonstrate practice. Thus, it is said that this text is insufficient for instruction, and further associations are ordered—referring to the following passages.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Association* means to entrust. The people of lower capacity cannot yet bear the Great Vehicle’s teachings, so they must first have associations to arouse their learning. The associated text is the four lines below:\n\nSeeing simplicity, embracing sincerity,\n**Explication:** *Seeing simplicity* means to see and guard simplicity, not to adorn with artifice.\n\n*Embracing sincerity* means to embrace one’s natural simplicity and demonstrate it to the world, so it may be emulated.\n\nFew in private,\n**Explication:** To be upright and without self-interest.\n\nFew in desires,\n**Explication:** To know contentment.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Seeing simplicity*—rejecting ornamentation. *Embracing sincerity*—returning to reality. *Few in private*—uprightness and justice. *Few in desires*—quelling greed.\n\nAbandoning learning,\n**Explication:** Abandoning learning that is not true or does not conform to the Dao’s teachings.\n\nWithout worry.\n**Explication:** Removing superficiality, then there is no worry or trouble.\n\n○**Jie Jie says:** This means abandoning all scriptures and returning to the One.\n\n○**Yu says:** Abandoning the learning of contrivance, then one becomes pure and simple.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Worry*—trouble. Abandoning the learning of relative forms, one attains the principle of non-action, and thus troubles are exhausted, so there is no worry.\n\nHow far apart are *yes* and *ah*?\n**Explication:** Both are responses, yet how far apart they are—criticizing the times for valuing superficiality and demeaning substance.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Yes*—respectful assent. *Ah*—a lazy response. The *Records of Rites* says: When the teacher summons, do not answer. *How far apart*—not distant, but people do not understand the distinction between compliance and defiance, recklessly generating joy or anger. Hearing *yes* brings joy; hearing *ah* brings disdain, unaware that *yes* and *ah* issue from the same mouth, not far apart.\n\nHow far apart are good and evil?\n**Explication:** *Good* is praise, *evil* is slander—how different are they? The times detest the loyal and upright, favoring deceitful flatterers.\n\n○**Shu says:** Conforming to desire is good; opposing the heart is evil. Since compliance and defiance are both empty, beauty and ugliness are meaningless. Moreover, *yes* and *ah* arise from one mouth, while good and evil stem from one heart. Those who forget know they are not distinct; those who cling are divided like the liver and gall. Yet those entangled in contrivance are many, and within the distinctions of right and wrong, within the *yes* and *ah*, lies the root of all troubles. To abandon them is to have no worry—these two pairs briefly illustrate what must be abandoned in the learning of attachment.\n\nWhat people fear,\n**Explication:** *People*—the Daoist practitioner. What they fear is fearing not to abandon learning in rulers.\n\nCannot but fear.\n**Explication:** Nearby are those who kill the virtuous through flattery.\n\n○**Shu says:** This is what the practitioner fears—life and death, and all worldly entanglements.\n\n**Explication:** They will surely perish. Earlier, it was ordered to abandon evil, showing that beauty and ugliness are both empty, lest one become attached to this text and be stained by worldly affairs. Hence, this sentence is issued as a warning.\n\nHow vast and endless it is!\n**Explication:** The people of the world are chaotic and unrestrained, desiring to study but clinging to false teachings, with no end.\n\n○**Shu says:** The *River Above* text reads *vast*, while others say *wild and boundless*—a distant, dim vastness. *Endless*—lamenting that it does not cease. The hearts of sentient beings are deeply entangled for a long time, their attachments firm, with no time of rest.\n\nAll people are exultant,\n**Explication:** *Exultant*—indulgent in lust and desire.\n\nLike feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\n**Explication:** Like a starving man craving the finest sacrificial meats, never satisfied.\n\nLike ascending a terrace in spring.\n**Explication:** In spring, yin and yang interact, and all things respond. Ascending a terrace to gaze upon it, one’s desires are unrestrained.\n\n○**Shu says:** Many are entangled, hence *all people*—another term for *sentient beings*. *Exultant*—joy and delight. *Feasting*—banqueting. *Grandest sacrifice*—ox, sheep, and pig. Sentient beings delight in sounds and colors, their attachments extreme, like a starving man feasting on the finest sacrificial meats, finding such joy, or like ascending a terrace in spring, gazing upon forests and fields, finding their hearts fully at ease.\n\nI alone am serene, with no signs yet.\n**Explication:** I alone am serene and tranquil, with no traces of desire.\n\n○**Shu says:** *I*—the Old Master’s self-reference. *Serene*—stillness. *Signs*—manifestation. The Sage, though in the world, has a still and serene mind, untouched by the surroundings, with no inclination toward green hills.\n\nLike an infant before it smiles.\n**Explication:** Like a child before it can laugh at others.\n\n○**Yu says:** I alone am serene and tranquil, with no traces of desire, like that infant before it can laugh.\n\nTowering yet without destination.\n**Explication:** Towering like a remote village, with nowhere to go.\n\n○**Yu says:** The Perfect One has no mind; movement follows things, taking and giving nothing. Like a traveler with no destination.\n\n○**Shu says:** *Infant*—the uncarved block. *Smile*—laughter. *Towering*—vastness. *Destination*—movement. The Sage acts without deviating from stillness, remains untouched in defilement, like that infant before it can laugh, its form and mind both still. Its wisdom is vast and respectful, its capacity boundless—like an empty boat with no mooring.\n\nAll people have excess,\n**Explication:** People have excess wealth for luxury, excess intelligence for deceit.",

honor and disgrace.\n\n**Moderation brings gain,**\n**Explication:** *Shǎo*, to take little—then one gains much.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven favors the humble,\nthe divine illuminates the empty.\n**Excess brings confusion,**\n**Explication:** *Duō*, to be excessive.\nThe vulgar, with many thoughts and desires,\nwalk without steadfastness—\nthus they are confused.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Shǎo* refers to the complete practice of *Yǎng* (bending/extending),\nunaware of high and low,\ndwelling in the singular middle.\n\n*Duō* refers to being stuck in the duality of *Wéi Shùn* (compliance/transgression),\nnever leaving the two extremes.\n\nTo embody the singular middle—then gain is attained;\nto cling to the two extremes—then confusion arises.\n\nThus the sage holds the One as the model for all under Heaven.\n**Explication:** *Bào*, to guard/hold.\n*Shì*, law/pattern.\nThe sage guards the One and thus knows all things,\nmaking it the law/pattern for all under Heaven.\n\n○**Commentary:** It means to focus on the One Dao/Way,\nto guard the balance of the self.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Shì*, law/pattern.\nThe sage upholds this singular middle Dao/Way,\nguiding all beings by its path—\nthus becoming the exemplar for all under Heaven’s cultivation.\n\n**Not self-illuminating—then clarity,**\n**Explication:** The sage does not see the world as through his own eyes,\nbut uses the sight of all under Heaven to perceive it—\nthus attaining clarity.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Wù* (things) and *wǒ* (self) alike are empty,\nno perception of self or form—\nthus wisdom shines brightly.\n\n**Not self-righteous—then brilliance,**\n**Explication:** The sage does not assert his own correctness while rejecting others—\nthus his virtue/power shines in the world.\n\n○**Commentary:** Self and others are equal;\nnot asserting correctness in oneself or in things—\nthus his virtue/power is manifest and evident.\n\n**Not self-praising—then

magnify/boast.\nThe sage does not exalt himself—\nthus his virtue/power endures without peril.\n\n○**Commentary:** Only by attributing merit to others,\nnot boasting or magnifying—\nthus his virtue/power lasts far and wide.\n\n**For only the non-competing—\nnone under Heaven can compete with them.**\n**Explication:** *Zhēng*, to contend.\nThis praises those of the four virtues,\nwho grasp compliance/transgression subtly,\ncultivate themselves with humility—\nand do not contend with others—\nthus all ranks under Heaven cannot contend with the non-competing.\n\n**The ancients’ saying—\"Flexibility brings wholeness\"—\nwas it idle speech?**\n\n**Explication:** *Qū*, to bend.\n*Zéng*, to follow.\nThe ancients said that bending and yielding in compliance\npreserves one’s Dao/Way—\nthis saying is true, not idle.\nOnly by following the teachings and practicing accordingly,\nnot contending with others—\none attains complete virtue/power,\nand all things return to oneself.\n\nThus, **wholeness is indeed attained and returned.**\n\n**Explication:** *Chéng*, reality/truth.\nThose who practice bending and yielding\ntruly preserve their body and mind,\nreturning to their parents (nature)—\nno harm comes to them.\n\n**Sparse speech is natural.**\n**Explication:** *Xī*, to love/minimize.\nThose who love minimizing speech\nembody the Dao/Way of Nature.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Xī*, few/sparse.\nIf one loves few words and sparse speech,\nthen actions align with Nature’s Dao/Way.\n\n○**Commentary:** *Xī*, to minimize.\nMinimizing speech is to forget speech.\nThe ultimate of Nature is the *Chóng Xuán* (profound emptiness).\nDao/Way seeks to clarify the ultimate,\nwhich transcends speech.\nSpeech itself deviates from principle—\nonly by forgetting speech and discarding teaching,\ncan one aptly meet the profound emptiness.\n\n**Gale winds do not last a morning,\ntorrent rains do not last a day.**\n\n**Explication:** *Piāo*, drifting.\n*Fēng*, wind.\n*Zòu*, sudden.\n*Yǔ*, rain.\nIt says that swiftness cannot endure,\nviolence cannot persist.\n\n○**Commentary:** Drifting winds and sudden rains\ndo not even last a morning—\nhow could they endure a full day?\nIt likens those who cling to teaching, lost in doctrine,\nto rash actions in pursuit of swift rewards—\ntheir resolve is fleeting and cannot last long,\nhence the comparison to gale winds and torrent rains.\n\nDay is the total of morning,\nmorning is a division of day—\nthe division illustrates the newness of each moment,\nthe total signifies the span of a hundred years,\nboth convey impermanence.\n\n○**Commentary:** Mountains and valleys communicate,\ngiving rise to gale winds.\nYin-qi erupts,\nforming torrent rains.\nWhen yin and yang

      "translated_text": "○ *Cū says:* To perceive the nature of others—discerning their subtleties, whether profound or shallow—without failing to know them fully: this is *other-heart wisdom*. To know oneself is clarity.\n\n*Commentary:* When one knows their own virtues and flaws, this is *listening in silence* and *gazing inward without form*—thus it is called clarity.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* The wise employ their intelligence to discern things, while the enlightened illuminate subtleties with radiant insight. Intelligence may have its limits, but enlightenment knows no bounds.\n\n○ *Cū says:* To know one’s past lives—both merit and sin—and the retributions of the three ages with perfect clarity: this is *host-fate wisdom*.\n\nTo overcome others is strength,\n*Commentary:* Those who overcome others do so only through coercive power.\n\n○ *Cū says:* Intelligence and strength overcome others; might subdues beings. Thus one subdues celestial demons and eliminates heterodox paths—this is *subduing-demons wisdom*.\n\n○ *Gù says:* Talent and capability may overcome others, but strength alone is fleeting. Those with strength must have adversaries. If one has adversaries, strength is not yet absolute. But to master one’s nature and temper emotions—that is *self-overcoming*. Those who overcome themselves have no rival within themselves, and thus may be called truly strong.\n\n*Self-overcoming is strength.*\n*Commentary:* When one conquers their own desires, none in the world can contend with them—thus they are strong.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* Those who can conquer others are merely strong in power. But those who conquer their own hearts, softening them, alone preserve their true strength.\n\n○ *Cū says:* To subdue one’s own mind, to master all entangling desires—when desires no longer arise, wisdom grows ever stronger: this is *severing-delusion wisdom*.\n\nTo know contentment is wealth,\n*Commentary:* When one knows sufficiency as sufficiency, they preserve fortune and blessing eternally—thus they are wealthy.\n\n○ *Cū says:* To guard one’s portion and know contentment is not merely to avoid poverty in wealth, but to be rich in virtue and morality. Further, to discern presence and absence—when all realms are illuminated, wisdom knows no lack, and thus is called *wealth*—this is *contentment wisdom*.\n\nTo act with vigor is resolve.\n*Commentary:* When one exerts strength in doing good, they are said to have resolve in the Dao, and the Dao responds in kind.\n\n○ *Jié says:* To practice the Dao without rest, day and night.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* Those who know contentment lack greed—thus they are wealthy. Those who act with vigor never falter—thus they possess resolve and principle.\n\n○ *Cū says:* *Resolve* is principle. When resolve is strong, great vows arise—prioritizing others over self, sacrificing one’s life to benefit beings, even in the final moments, never retreating.\n\nTo never lose one’s place is longevity.\n*Commentary:* When one preserves their vital essence, cherishing the heavens’ refined *qi*, they endure.\n\n○ *Jié says:* To never lose one’s singular essence.\n\n○ *Cū says:* Responding to circumstances with appropriate remedies, administering medicine to suit each ailment—all in perfect accord, never straying from what is fitting. Thus, in interacting with beings, one remains enduring and unyielding.\n\nTo die yet not perish is longevity.\n*Commentary:* Eyes do not gaze wantonly, ears do not listen indiscriminately, the mouth does not speak recklessly—thus no resentment lingers in the world, and one attains true longevity.\n\n○ *Jié says:* Referring to those who achieve *corpse dissolution*—dying only to be reborn.\n\n○ *Cū says:* When both deeds and vows are complete, inner and outer paths aligned, logically there should be no death or birth, no untimely end or extended life. Yet it is said, *\"To die yet not perish\"*—to clarify that death is not true death, and non-longevity is true longevity. The body may depart, but the Sage’s essence remains unchanged—thus it is called *longevity*.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* Death is the end of one’s appointed fate; perishing is the reversal of heaven’s will; longevity is the fulfillment of one’s allotted span. To know others and overcome them invites calamity, but contentment and vigor align with the natural order. To die yet not perish—this is the completion of one’s span, and thus may be called *longevity*.\n\nThe Great Dao is boundless,\n*Commentary:* The Dao is vast, like floating and sinking, presence and absence—visible yet unseen, spoken yet indistinct.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* The Great Dao is boundless, unrestrained yet responsive to all things, neither favoring left nor right.\n\nIts left and right are boundless.\n*Commentary:* The Dao can turn left or right, fitting all circumstances.\n\n○ *Cū says:* *Boundless* means unrestrained, also universal. The Dao is empty and mysterious, boundless in compassion, responding as it is moved—though neither yin nor yang, it adapts to left and right, revealing that square and round conform to things, exhausting all possibilities without fail. Hence *Zhuangzi* says: *\"There is left and right, there is right and wrong.\"*\n\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it does not decline.\n*Commentary:* All things depend on the Dao for existence, yet it never refuses or resists.\n\n○ *Cū says:* All things rely on the ultimate Dao for their formation, compassionately saving and guiding, never weary of effort. Further, things themselves do not decline—they arise naturally.\n\nIts achievements are unnamed.\n*Commentary:* The Dao does not claim credit for its accomplishments.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* All things rely on the harmonious *qi* of the Dao for transformation, yet the Dao does not decline in its labor. When its functions are complete, it does not claim ownership.\n\n○ *Cū says:* It nurtures all forms of life, its subtle work unseen, yet its merit is attributed to the things themselves—thus it does not claim the name of achievement.\n\nIt clothes all things yet is not their master—\nThis may be called *small*.\n*Commentary:* The Dao, though nurturing all things, does not rule like a sovereign.\n\n○ *Yuè says:* *Clothing* is akin to nurturing.\n\n○ *Cū says:* It clothes all beings, molding life—yet its divine function remains hidden, not assuming mastery. Humbling itself before things, it is rightly called *small*—though not truly small, but *small in name*.",

It does not rule as a sovereign—its meaning has been explained before. Since all things turn to the Dao, it rightly bears the name of *great*—though not truly great, but *great in name*.\n\nThus, the Sage never claims greatness,\n*Commentary:* The Sage follows the Dao, concealing virtue and hiding renown, not indulging in grandiosity.\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\n*Commentary:* The Sage embodies the Dao, acting without speech yet transforming all things, and thus attains true greatness.\n*Yuè says:* The Sage follows the Dao and forgets merit, never seeking to magnify itself, and so achieves true greatness.\n*Cū says:* The Sage who embodies the Dao forgets self for things, retreats in stillness and humility, never claiming greatness—only prioritizing others over self, forgetting merit and greatness. Thus, it becomes the leader of all beings, alone holding the highest honor in the Three Realms, and attains true greatness.\n\nHolding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven turns toward it.\n*Commentary:* *Holding* means upholding. *Symbol* refers to the Dao. The Sage upholds the Great Dao, and thus all people align their hearts and turn toward it. Governing the self, Heaven sends divine clarity, coming and going within it.\n*Cū says:* *Holding* means to grasp, yet it is grasping without grasping, grasping nothing. The Great Symbol is like the law of the Great Dao—just as the Sage who forgets greatness upholds the formless Great Symbol, always benefiting things, making all under Heaven turn toward it.\nAs in *Zhuangzi*: \"Wang Dai stood without teaching, sat without ruling, empty in departure, full in return.\" Confucius led all under Heaven to turn toward him.\nComing and going without harm,\nIt brings peace, stability, and harmony.\n*Commentary:* When all things turn without harm, the realm is secure, families are at peace, and great harmony prevails. Governing the self without harming the divine, the body remains secure and long-lived.\n*Yuè says:* Things turn without harm, and thus dwell in great peace.\n*Cū says:* *Great* means vast. The common people turn to the most sagely, all gaining benefit without loss. The benefit they gain is the law of peace and stability. Without harm, it reveals the removal of suffering; peace and stability speak of sharing in joy.\n\nJoy and delicacies—\nThe passing traveler stops.\n*Commentary:* *Delicacies* means beauty. The traveler is one. If one takes delight in the Dao’s beauty, they will stop and stay.\nOne is the absence of excess, dwelling in emptiness, like a passing traveler.\n\nThe Dao, when spoken of, is without taste.\n*Commentary:* The Dao, entering and exiting the mouth, is insipid—unlike the five flavors of sour, salty, bitter, sweet, and spicy.\n*Cū says:* The utmost Dao is empty and silent, its essence subtle and elusive. Thus, its speech is insipid and without allure, unlike music or fine foods that delight the senses. Music has sounds to please, delicacies have flavors to nourish—what is pleasing and satisfying makes even passing travelers stop and linger. But the Dao’s speech is insipid, and few scholars pause to reflect.\n\nAh, how deeply the world’s folly is obscured!\nThey can indulge in pleasing sounds,\nYet who can savor the tasteless taste?\n\nIt cannot be seen when gazed upon,\n*Commentary:* *Sufficient* means attainment. The Dao is formless—unlike the five colors of blue, yellow, red, white, and black that can be perceived.\n*Cū says:* The utmost Dao is profound and dark, transcending form and color. Unlike worldly teachings, it cannot be recognized by the eyes.\n\nIt cannot be heard when listened to,\n*Commentary:* The Dao is unlike the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—that can be heard.\n*Cū says:* The great sound is subtle and without pitch. It is not like the tones of *gong* and *shang*, nor can it be heard like bells and drums. The Sage’s speech follows this same principle.\n\nIts use cannot be exhausted.\n*Commentary:* Using the Dao to govern the realm brings wealth and prosperity to the people; governing the self extends life—there is no end to its use.\n*Yuè says:* With the Dao in stillness, there is no need for spoken instruction. Thus, it cannot be seen, cannot be heard. Pure winds prevail, all things flourish abundantly, and each year’s harvests overflow—so its use cannot be exhausted. *Exhausted* means finished.\n*Cū says:* The utmost Dao’s words are insipid and distant, neither sound nor color, transcending sight and hearing. Like a mirror’s reflection, things come and it responds; like the Sage’s wisdom, it responds intuitively. Thus, the use of the non-use is difficult to exhaust.\n\nWhen one would gather it,\nOne must first disperse it;\n*Commentary:* First, one opens and disperses to indulge in extreme decadence.\n*Cū says:* *Gather* means to contract, to restrain. To enact governance and transform all things, making them contract and not be corrupted by luxury, one must first open and indulge them, pushing them to extreme decadence. This was how Laozi, upon entering the Western Regions, first allowed their fierce and unrestrained nature to flourish before transforming them with the Dao.\n\nWhen one would weaken it,\nOne must first strengthen it;\n*Commentary:* First strengthening it is to invite disaster.\n*Cū says:* To make them return to the Dao’s gentle weakness, one must first push them to extreme strength, then guide them toward yielding softness.\n\nWhen one would abolish it,\nOne must first establish it;\n*Commentary:* First establishing it is to let their arrogance and excess reach danger.\n*Cū says:* To abolish their brutality, one must first indulge their ferocity. Once their ferocity reaches its peak, it can be abolished.\n\nWhen one would take from it,\nOne must first give to it.\n*Commentary:* First giving to it is to indulge their greed.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao is ever without action yet without failing to act.\n*Commentary:* The Dao is always without action.\n*Exegesis:* The Dao of profound stillness is quiescent and without action, yet from its essence arises function, responding to things and transforming them—hence it is said to be without failing to act. The first sentence is the root, the second the manifestation; this clarifies root and manifestation, the interplay of stillness and motion.\n\n*Cai* says: The Dao’s essence is congealed and still, its true realm unmoving—hence it is said to be without action. Yet it responds to things and moves; nothing is left unused—hence it is said to be without failing to act. If lords and kings could uphold it, all things would spontaneously transform.\n*Commentary:* If lords and kings could uphold the Dao, all things would spontaneously transform, benefiting themselves.\n*Yu* says: The wondrous root is pure and pristine, hence always without action. Things rely on it to thrive, yet it is without failing to act. If lords and kings could uphold the Dao’s non-action, all things would spontaneously transform. The ruler’s non-action brings the world to simplicity and purity.\n*Exegesis:* Even sovereigns of ten thousand chariots, rulers of the five ranks—if they could uphold this Dao, the eight extremes and myriad lands would naturally follow its transformation. The same applies to commoners. The reason this passage emphasizes lords and kings is to show that rulers lead transformation, benefiting and expanding for all.\n*Du* says: Virtue can subdue things; the Dao is present, and thus the sovereign is honored. Kings who uphold the Dao do not command—yet all is balanced. Dukes and marquises embrace virtue without severity, yet all is transformed.\n*Luo* (Rushen) *Inner Explanation* says: The mind attains emptiness yet does not lose its resources; all spirits follow transformation, and evil is subdued, returning to the right path.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act, I shall restrain it with the nameless Primal Simplicity.\n*Commentary:* \"I\" refers to the self; the nameless Primal Simplicity is the Dao. All things transform, benefiting themselves.\n*Yu* says: When people have followed the ruler’s transformation—non-action, pure and pristine—and yet still desire to act and do, I shall restrain them with the nameless Primal Simplicity, which is the Dao.\n*Exegesis:* \"Act\" means to begin cultivation. \"Primal Simplicity\" is the Dao. It says that when beings first begin cultivation, they must have desires for fruition. Once such desires arise, one must settle their mind with the nameless, pristine Dao, so that it is not stained by the worldly—this is to dispel the \"having\" with the \"non.\"\n*Gu* says: \"Act\" means deceit arises. It says that when a lord upholds the Dao, all things follow transformation, yet someone from within this harmony might harbor deceitful intentions. The Master says, \"I shall restrain them with the Dao.\" Again: \"Make their hearts chaotic, so that there is no distinction.\" Again: \"The nameless Primal Simplicity is instruction.\" The nameless Primal Simplicity also does not desire; not desiring is stillness.\n*Commentary:* It says that when a ruler restrains with virtue and the Dao, the people will also not desire, hence one must guide them with purity and stillness.\n*Exegesis:* Not only must one not desire the \"having\" of laws, but one must also not desire the \"non\" of this nameless purity. Earlier, the \"non\" dispelled the \"having\"; now, the \"non\" dispels the \"non.\" Having and non are both dispelled, departing from the single Middle Way. The world will then spontaneously rectify itself.\n*Commentary:* Stillness is cessation. Earlier, the nameless dispelled the having; next, not desiring dispelled the non. Having and non having are both dispelled, not desiring is then extinguished, and not desiring removed, the single Middle is effaced. This is dispelling again and again, the mysterious beyond the mysterious—what is called probing the subtle, seeking the hidden, exhausting principle, and perfecting nature. Then all dharmas are without exception true and genuine; even weeds and tiles are all the utmost Dao—hence it is said the world spontaneously rectifies itself. This one sentence seals the gate of all mysteries.\n*Yu* says: The nameless Primal Simplicity also does not desire—it says that when the ruler has restrained with the nameless Primal Simplicity, the common people must not cling to this namelessness, lest they seek to advance and lose their root, falling back into action. Hence, even this nameless Primal Simplicity must be forgotten. Not desiring desire, not desiring is also forgotten—pure and pristine, the world spontaneously rectifies itself.\nAgain: The Dao is ever without desire, delighting in purity, hence it makes heaven and earth ever rectified. Heaven and earth are the Dao’s subjects; when the ruler follows the Dao and issues precepts, the hearts of all subjects will spontaneously rectify.\n\nThe highest virtue does not claim virtue, hence it has virtue;\n*Commentary:* The highest virtue refers to the ancient sovereign without name—his virtue is great yet unnamed, hence it is called highest virtue. \"Not claiming virtue\" means he does not teach virtue to the people; he follows nature, nurturing human life and vitality, his virtue unseen—hence it is said he does not claim virtue. It says his virtue aligns with heaven and earth, harmonious *qi* flowing, and the people are thereby preserved.\n*Exegesis:* \"Highest\" means elevated, a name for transcendence. \"Virtue\" means attainment, with the sense of achieving. It says those of highest virtue intuitively grasp the Dao’s realm; their insight is obscure yet unified, attainment and loss both forgotten. Attainment and loss forgotten—hence it is said they do not claim virtue. Insight obscure yet unified—hence it is said they have virtue. Having virtue dispels loss; not claiming virtue dispels attainment.\n\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue, hence it has no virtue.\n*Commentary:* The lower virtue refers to the named sovereign—his virtue does not reach that of the highest, hence it is called lower virtue. \"Not losing virtue\" means his virtue is visible, his deeds praiseworthy. Since he bears a name and title, it is said he has no virtue.\nThe highest virtue acts without action, yet there is nothing it does not act upon;\n*Commentary:* It says the Dao’s law is tranquil, without contrivance, hence there is no need for a name.\n*Exegesis:* \"Act upon\" means to use. The highest virtue acts without action, reaching the root of congealed stillness, yet its manifestation is empty and wondrous—this is called non-action yet action; action is precisely non-action.",

      "translated_text": "The lower virtue acts with contrivance, yet there is something it does act upon.\n*Commentary:* It speaks of a sovereign who enforces teachings and policies, all for his own sake, and claims a name for himself. ○*Exegesis:* Since his heart does not forget virtue, he is called \"for it.\" Yet he still has affairs to attend to, hence it is said he acts with contrivance.\n\nThe highest virtue acts with benevolence, yet there is nothing it does not transcend.\n*Commentary:* The highest virtue refers to a sovereign who practices benevolence without equal, hence it is called the highest virtue. \"Acts with benevolence\" means to extend compassion. When deeds are accomplished and affairs established, there is nothing to cling to as a means. ○*Exegesis:* Benevolence is compassion—it arises from a mind of nurturing. Since he does not value reciprocal kindness, it is said he transcends contrivance. Though the highest virtue is not as profound as the lower virtue, in terms of moral rectitude, benevolence surpasses it, hence it is called \"transcend contrivance.\" Within the Three Jewels, compassion is paramount, so among the Five Virtues, benevolence is also placed first.\n\nThe highest righteousness acts with contrivance, yet there is something it does act upon.\n*Commentary:* It acts with righteousness to sever and cut away—his actions are for his own sake, killing to establish his authority, taxing the people to sustain his own indulgence. ○*Exegesis:* Righteousness upholds the correction of evil and the punishment of wrongdoing, as seen in the scriptures’ precepts and disciplines. Yet the essence of these precepts, when applied to lower beings, still involves contrivance; they have not yet reached the realm of empty and wondrous non-action, hence it is said he acts with contrivance.\n\nThe highest propriety acts, yet none respond to it.\n*Commentary:* It refers to a sovereign whose propriety is without equal. \"Acts\" means to establish rites, institutions, and ceremonial authority. It speaks of propriety being ornate yet inwardly decayed, adorned with falsehood and excessive detail—any movement departs from the Dao, and thus it cannot be responded to. ○*Exegesis:* Propriety emphasizes ceremonial decorum, as seen in the scriptures’ teachings on fasting, rituals, and etiquette. Moreover, the highest Dao is boundless and tranquil, its great form without substance; yet now it is devalued, the simple esteemed over the elaborate, the plain over the ornate, and only ceremonial authority is upheld. Though it may be a gradual teaching, it fails to align with true principle, not only contradicting the Dao internally but also unable to harmonize with the external world, hence it is said none respond to it. ○*Lu’s Saying:* The rites of jade and silk are used as tokens for betrothal, hence it is called \"highest.\" Rank and title are conferred in due measure, hence it is said \"acts.\" Yet with so many ceremonial details, the jade and silk are exhausted, and the people cannot sustain the sovereign, hence it is said \"none respond to it.\" Because none respond, punishments are enforced. Then, he raises his arm in anger and drags others into conflict.\n*Commentary:* It speaks of how, when propriety is too burdensome to be followed, the sovereign and the people grow resentful, hence he raises his arm in anger and drags others into contention. ○*Yu’s Saying:* Propriety emphasizes reciprocity and mutual expectation. Because of its shallow observance, he raises his arm in anger and drags others into conflict, desiring to make clear the flaws of teaching propriety. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Rujiu is thin, yet Handan was besieged\"—this is its case. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue alone remains.",

It responds to things according to their time, but **virtue/power** of the lower order appears only when the **Dao/Way** is lost.\n\nWhen **virtue/power** is lost, **benevolence** (仁) emerges,\n　　○*Commentary:* It means that as **virtue/power** wanes, **benevolence** and love take its place.\n\nWhen **benevolence** is lost, **righteousness** (義) arises,\n　　○*Commentary:* When **benevolence**’s compassion fails to prevail, **righteousness**’s distinctions then arise.\n\nWhen **righteousness** is lost, **propriety** (礼) is practiced.\n\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* Those who lose the **Dao/Way** lose the **highest virtue**, for the **highest virtue** aligns with the **Dao/Way**, hence it is said \"lose the **Dao/Way**.\"\n\nNow, **virtue/power**, **benevolence**, **righteousness**, and **propriety** are merely the names of refined and coarse customs in different times. Thus, when the **Dao/Way** declines, **virtue/power** appears; when **virtue/power** is lost, **benevolence** remains; when **benevolence** fades, **righteousness** stands forth; when **righteousness** is gone, **propriety** is resorted to—these are all fitting measures for their times. Therefore, when discussing **propriety** in the age of simplicity and purity (淳朴), it is either madness or perversity; when **propriety** is forgotten in the age of artificiality and corruption (浇醨), it is either foolishness or slander. If one can dissolve and transcend these layers, they should abandon **propriety** to uphold **righteousness**, abandon **righteousness** to uphold **benevolence**, abandon **benevolence** to uphold **virtue/power**, and forget **virtue/power** to return to the **Dao/Way**, thus restoring simplicity and purity. Then, the **highest virtue** will have nothing to rely upon.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* From the **Dao/Way**’s decline in the age of artificiality and corruption to its uttermost extreme, unable to curb evil, **propriety** is then employed for ritual and etiquette. Though it may forcefully establish ceremonial decorum, its superficiality only grows worse.\n\n**Propriety** is the thinning of **loyalty and trustworthiness** (忠信),\n　　○*Commentary:* It means that **propriety**, though it regulates external forms, neglects its roots—**loyalty and trustworthiness**—and thus these virtues grow ever more shallow.\n\nAnd the beginning of **chaos**.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Propriety** values outward display over inner sincerity, so the upright and honest dwindle while licentiousness and disorder flourish.\n\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Propriety** is meant to rescue **chaos**, yet it esteems rigid knowledge. Those who cling to **propriety**’s outward forms—who prize jade and silk, who revere bowing and kneeling—are the very ones who become the starting point of **foolishness and ignorance**.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* Those who claim to know without true understanding are called **pretense of knowledge** (前识). This is the case of those who have lost the **Dao/Way**’s substance but cling to its superficial trappings. Such **pretense of knowledge** is the origin of **stupidity and darkness**.\n\n　　○*Gu’s Saying:* **Pretense of knowledge** refers to those who do not await deep inquiry. Now, the pure and subtle **Dao/Way** is profound beyond comprehension, formless and colorless—its truth lies within itself. Yet those who rely on elaborate discourse and ornate displays, who flaunt ceremonial splendor and arrayed beauty, these are not the **Dao/Way**’s true essence but its superficial adornments, the beginning of **stupidity**.\n\nWhen **stupidity** first takes root, it has not yet encountered the **Dao/Way**’s true reality, so it is led astray by **pretense of knowledge**. The **Dao/Way**’s superficiality corrupts its very beginning. The *Sequence of Families* says: This interpretation is the most refined.\n\nTherefore, the **great man** (大丈夫) dwells in the **thick substance** (厚),\n　　○*Commentary:* **Great man** refers to one of **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—a leader who sustains the people with courage, compassion, and wisdom. His aspirations are vast and universal, hence the name **great man**.\n\nBut not in the **thin veneer** (薄).\n\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Artifice** (有为) is the **Dao/Way**’s thinness. **Propriety** and **righteousness** are the **virtue/power**’s superficial adornments. Thus, the sage dwells in the **Dao/Way**’s **non-artifice** (无为), which is its **thick substance**.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* The **great man** of the **Dao/Way**, the transcendent scholar, should anchor his emotions in **virtue/power**’s true essence, not fixate on the **pretense of knowledge**’s superficial trappings. Hence, he discards the latter for the former.\n\n　　○*Commentary:* Discarding the **thin veneer** means severing **benevolence** and **righteousness**. Taking the **thick substance** means returning to simplicity and purity. Moreover, the **highest virtue** of the sage embodies **non-duality** (无分别), so how could he ever fixate on distinctions or be entangled in discarding and taking? Indeed, it is not a matter of discarding what is not to be discarded, nor of taking what is not to be taken. The same holds true for the **Dao/Way**’s duality of superficiality and substance.\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained **Oneness** (一):\n　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Oneness** is the **wonderful harmony of pure and subtle qi** (冲和之妙气).\n\n　　○*Commentary:* **Ancient** refers to the past. It speaks of those who attained the **Dao/Way** in bygone ages, and their condition is fully described in the following text. This is **Yu** citing the past to elucidate the present.\n\nThe heavens attained **Oneness** with **clarity** (清),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the **muddy pellet** (泥丸) within the human head emits **pure qi**, which descends to illuminate, hence it is said \"with **clarity**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* The heavens absorb the **Dao/Way**’s **qi**, thus gathering **yang** to form the sky, which remains **clear and elevated** above.\n\nThe earth attained **Oneness** with **tranquility** (宁),\n　　○*Commentary:* The earth, too, absorbs the **Dao/Way**’s **Oneness**, thus congealing **yin** to form the earth, which remains **tranquil and still** below.\n\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the **elixir field** (丹田) does not indulge in licentiousness or disorder, and **spirit** (神) resides within the body, hence it is said \"with **tranquility**.\"\n\nThe **spirit** (神) attained **Oneness** with **aliveness** (灵),\n　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* **Spirit** refers to the **heart** (心). The **heart** is the **alive spirit** of the five **zang** organs (五藏), hence it is said \"with **aliveness**.\"\n\n　　○*Commentary:* It means that the **spirit** attains **Oneness**, hence its ability to **transform and manifest without form**.»",

Because of its shallow observance, he raises his arm in anger and drags others into conflict, desiring to make clear the flaws of teaching propriety. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Rujiu is thin, yet Handan was besieged\"—this is its case. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue alone remains.",

      "translated_text": "The weak is taken for its yielding softness and receptive stillness—\nreceptive stillness is how the Sage abides in substance.\nTo abide in substance is the Dao’s constant application,\nthus it is said: *The weak is the Dao’s use.*\n\nAll things under Heaven are born of *having*,\n*—for all things arise from Heaven and Earth’s form and place.*\nHaving is born of *non-being*,\n*—for Heaven and Earth’s mysteries, the fluttering and crawling of life,*\n*all arise from the Dao, which is formless and nameless.*\nThis speaks of the root prevailing over the flourishing,\nthe weak prevailing over the strong,\nhumility prevailing over fullness.\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nSubstance and strategy are like non-being generating having—\nthus those who practice strategy must return to substance,\nand those who employ having must rely on non-being.\nYet the ultimate Dao is boundless and silent,\nfree from names and forms.\nAll dharmas are of empty nature,\nnot dependent on each other.\nIf one can forget both strategy and substance,\nand merge having and non-being,\nthen neither counting nor not-counting exists—\nthis may be called transcendence.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Having* is the Dao’s manifestation—\nthe so-called *One Qi of non-being*.\nThe primal One is the wondrous root—\nthe so-called *silent and empty realm*.\nAll things under Heaven arise from the Dao’s manifested laws,\nand these laws themselves arise from the wondrous root—\nthe ultimate non-being.\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao and strives to practice it.\n*—The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, exerts utmost effort to practice it.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe superior in wisdom, hearing the Dao,\ninstantly comprehends that all phenomena are empty,\nthus they diligently cultivate without hesitation or laziness.\n\nThe middle person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly.\n*—The middle person, hearing the Dao,*\n*seeks longevity through self-cultivation,*\n*and seeks peace for the realm,*\n*yet when confronted with wealth, desire, or honor,*\n*they are confused by passions and abandon it.*\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nThe middle person may ascend or descend,\nthus they are doubtful—\nsometimes holding, sometimes losing.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe middle in wisdom, dim in insight,\ncannot fully grasp the principles.\nThough they hear the Dao, they fail to penetrate its depths.\nIf they restrain their emotions and return to stillness,\nthey may briefly attain emptiness of mind,\nbut once immersed in worldly affairs,\nthey become entangled in the realm of having,\nvacillating between gain and loss—\nthus it is said: *uncertain holding or losing.*\n\nThe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it.\n*—The inferior person, greedy and desiring,*\n*sees the Dao’s softness as terrifying,*\n*sees its simplicity as vulgar,*\n*thus they laugh loudly.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe inferior in wisdom, dull and obtuse,\nhearing the profound and vast truths of the Dao,\nfail to comprehend and deem them empty fables,\nthus they scoff and laugh aloud.\n\nIf it is not laughed at, it is not the Dao.\n*—That which is not laughed at by the inferior is not worthy to be called the Dao.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThat which is not scorned by the vulgar\nis not worthy to be called the Sage’s Way.\n\nThus, the establishment of speech is as follows:\n*—The method of establishing the Dao is as in the six lines below.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Establishment*—to set forth.\nThe Dao practiced by the superior is established in the following:\n\nThe enlightened one appears as if in darkness,\n*—The one who illuminates the Dao*\n*appears as if blind and ignorant,*\n*concealing their brilliance among the common.*\n\nThe one advancing in the Dao appears as if retreating,\n*—The great scholar*\n*does not reveal their progress,*\n*though internally cultivating,*\n*externally they seem to decline.*\n\nThe one in harmony with the Dao blends with the common,\n*—*Harmony*—levelness.\nThe great Daoist does not distinguish themselves,\nappearing as if among many.*\n\nThe Sage’s virtue is like a deep valley,\n*—The Sage of highest virtue*\n*is like a valley,*\n*unashamed by filth or dampness.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe one who excels in moral cultivation\nis equal to the boundless void,\nthus they can embrace all things,\nlike an empty valley.\n*[Original note:]* Those who forget virtue\ndo not differ from the vulgar.\n\nThe greatly pure appear as if shamed,\n*—The greatly pure and virtuous*\n*appear as if stained,*\n*not displaying themselves.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Purity*—cleanness.\n*Shame*—defilement.\nThe one of great purity and high conduct\nblends with the dust,\ndoes not dazzle others,\nthus they can mix unnoticed—\nlike defilement.\n\nHence, the Eastern Sage purifies their Way\nwhile staining their traces—\nthis is the very meaning.\n\nThe broadly virtuous appear insufficient,\n*—The one of vast virtue*\n*appears as if foolish and lacking.*\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nGreat achievement while holding humility.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\nThe one bearing great virtue,\nabiding in Daoic forgetfulness,\ninternally overflows,\nyet externally appears deficient.\n\nLaozi’s transmission states:\n*The skilled merchant hides deeply like emptiness,*\n*The Sage of great virtue appears as if foolish.*\n\nThe one establishing virtue appears as if deceitful,\n*—The one establishing morality*\n*appears as if stealing,*\n*hiding their name and progress,*\n*like one who acts secretly,*\n*thus the Classic says:*\n*‘As if fearing their neighbors.’*\n\nThe genuine appear as if false,\n*—The genuine and sincere*\n*appear as if their colors fade,*\n*unclear.*\n\n○*Yu’s Commentary:*\nPure and harmonious in light.\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Genuine*—substance.\n*False*—change.\nThe scholar of pure substance,\nstill yet moving,\ntrue yet responsive,\ntheir changes reveal impermanence—\nthus they appear as if false.\n\nThe great square has no corners,\n*—The great and square*\n*has no crookedness or angles.*\n\n○*Exegesis:*\n*Corner*—angle.\nThe one embodying the great square\nfollows things naturally,\ndoes not cling to principles,\ndoes not establish petty angles—\nas said: *‘The superior transcends all nodes.’*\n\nGreat vessels take long to mature,\n*—The great vessel*\n*is like the

Thus, it is said that one should not align with rigid excess.\n\n*Qi* of stillness overcomes heat.\n*—Commentary:* In autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the Yellow Springs—when stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises, and heat is the source of life. ○*Exegesis:* *Liao* (frenzy) is the *yang* (active, bright). Stillness is the *yin* (passive, dark). *Sheng* (overcomes) means extreme. It speaks of the four seasons’ cyclical turn: when *yin* reaches its peak, *yang* emerges; when *yang* reaches its peak, *yin* arises. *Yin*’s emergence causes all things to wither; *yang*’s emergence causes all things to flourish. It analogizes stillness as the foundation of longevity, while frenzy is the root of decay, urging practitioners to abandon frenzy and return to stillness. Again, it explains: descending from the origin to its manifestation, we see frenzy overcoming cold. Returning from the manifestation to the origin, we see stillness overcoming heat. This clarifies how movement and stillness adapt to their proper times.\n\n*—Master Gu’s Explanation:* All things pushed to their limit invert. Movement pushed to its limit becomes stillness; stillness pushed to its limit becomes movement. Observing this, we see that extreme flourishing leads to decline, and extreme decline leads to flourishing—all phenomena in the world follow this pattern. Since it is not the norm to preserve, what should one covet or seek? Therefore, the sage takes nothing, seeks nothing, gains nothing, loses nothing, and in the five great practices of *Dao*, remains naturally pure and still, unaffected by cold or heat. Only then can he be the true master of the world, as it is said: *\"He who clears and stills himself becomes the rightful master of the world.\"*\n\n*—Commentary:* To clear and still oneself is to become the rightful master of the world. *Clearing* and *stillness* ensure enduring rectitude, and holding to the *Dao* means there is no end to its timelessness.\n\n*—Exegesis:* Pure, tranquil, and at ease—one can benefit himself and others, rectify what is wrong and suppress what is perverse. Thus, he becomes the rightful master of the world. This then concludes the exposition of stillness overcoming frenzy, clarifying the distinction between excellence and mediocrity.\n\n*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* It refers to entering deep mountains, practicing purity, and abiding in nature—then one becomes a true person.

      "translated_text": "However, the warhorses are turned to plowing fields.\n*—Commentary:* \"Plowing\" (粪) here means tilling. It signifies that when arms are not used, warhorses are instead employed to cultivate the fields. For those cultivating the self, it means channeling the vital essence of *yang* to nourish the body.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Explanation:* A ruler who follows the *Dao* governs through *wu-wei*, his actions free from greed, thus avoiding warfare. He dispenses with the use of warhorses, allowing people to till the fields. For those cultivating the self, it means restraining the six senses—like an army—to till the heart with the *Dao*. Hence, Mencius said: *\"All till their fields with dung, but none till their hearts with learning.\"*\n\nWhen the *Dao* prevails in the world,\n*—Commentary:* Meaning when the ruler of the world follows the *Dao*—\n\nthe warhorses are stabled at the outskirts.\n*—Commentary:* Constant warfare keeps warhorses stationed at the borders, never returning. *—Exegesis:* The outskirts are called *jiao* (郊). A ruler without the *Dao* oppresses his people, causing chaos. Greedy for territory, he wages endless wars, forcing military horses to remain permanently beyond the borders. Moreover, those who are reckless and competitive, their hearts devoid of the *Dao*, let their six senses—like an army—gallop through the dusty realm, hence the saying that they \"generate at the outskirts.\"\n\nNo guilt is greater than indulging desire.\n*—Commentary:* Lustful desire. *—Exegesis:* \"Guilt\" (罪) means ruin—being overwhelmed by suffering. When one encounters alluring sights that stir the heart’s craving, it is called \"desirable.\" Yet, if external phenomena can ensnare the mind, they become the root of sin. Thus, the previous passage states: *\"Do not see what is desirable, lest the heart be disturbed.\"*\n\nNo calamity is greater than knowing insufficiency.\n*—Commentary:* Wealth and honor cannot restrain oneself. *—Exegesis:* \"Calamity\" is the deepest form of guilt—when the heart clings to external phenomena, never satisfied, harming others and depleting resources. The guilt grows ever deeper, not just afflicting oneself but extending to three generations.\n\nNo blame is graver than the craving to possess.\n*—Master Yu’s Explanation:* The greatest misfortune is desire; its consequences are deep, hence \"blame.\" *—Exegesis:* \"Blame\" (咎) means censure. The heart’s craving for possession knows no bounds—its censure is unparalleled. Comparing the depths of guilt and calamity, the latter is heavier, while blame is lighter. To fully reveal human nature, both are made explicit.\n\nThus, the sufficiency of *knowing sufficiency*,\n*—Commentary:* Preserving the true root—\nis ever sufficient.\n*—Commentary:* Free from desire. *—Exegesis:* One who adheres to their proper place, without indulging in external pursuits, is always complete, never lacking.\n\nWithout stepping outside,\none knows the world.\n*—Commentary:* The sage does not step outside yet knows the world because they understand others through themselves, and others’ families through their own. *—Exegesis:* \"Outside\" refers to perception, discrimination, and the gates of the senses. The virtuous person, with an empty mind and inner stillness, does not let their thoughts wander into external phenomena, yet knows all under heaven. This is true illumination reflecting the mundane.\n\nWithout peering through the window,\none perceives the *Dao* of Heaven.\n*—Commentary:* The *Dao* of Heaven and humanity are the same; Heaven and man are interconnected, their vital *qi* flowing together. When a ruler is pure and still, Heaven’s *qi* aligns naturally. When a ruler is greedy, Heaven’s *qi* becomes turbulent and impure. All fortune, misfortune, benefit, and harm arise from within oneself. *—Master Yu’s Explanation:* With hands resting and *wu-wei* governance, no decrees are issued beyond the door, yet the *Dao* of Heaven is known. *—Exegesis:* The window (牖) refers to the sensory orifices. The *Dao* of Heaven is the natural principle. In a state of forgetfulness, seated and still, one does not gaze through the sensory gates, yet the true heart shines brightly, revealing the natural *Dao*. This is wisdom illuminating truth.\n\nThe door allows passage in and out—\nfrom true illumination to the mundane.\nThe window, when closed within—\na return to the true source.\n\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\n*—Commentary:* Observing others’ families from afar, others’ bodies from a distance—what is observed grows farther, and what is known grows less. *—Exegesis:* Those who are inverted cannot perceive truth; their minds follow phenomena, ever distant yet never satisfied. Their knowledge is shallow and obscured, lacking discernment.\n\nThus, the sage acts without going,\nyet knows all.\n*—Commentary:* The sage does not ascend to Heaven nor descend into the abyss, yet knows the world through the mind. *—Exegesis:* \"Acts without going\" means the mind does not cling to external phenomena yet knows all things in their true nature. Like a mirror hung in a hall, objects pass before it and are reflected without effort. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The sage does not use the mind to illuminate Heaven.\"*\n\nWithout seeing,\none names.\n*—Commentary:* The ruler cherishes the *Dao*, the people cherish virtue; the ruler values martial prowess, the people value strength. The sage infers the great from the small, the external from the internal. *—Exegesis:* \"Without seeing\" means penetrating the emptiness of all phenomena, for there is nothing visible. \"Names\" refers to rectifying names and classifying all things, leaving traces and manifesting teachings. Without seeing, one diminishes emotional attachments and ornamental excesses daily. *—Master Yu’s Explanation:* Since one does not peer through the window, it is said, \"without seeing.\" When humanity and Heaven are in harmony, one can name the era of great peace.\n\nWithout doing,\none achieves.\n*—Commentary:* If the ruler does nothing, the people have no tasks; households are prosperous, and all things transform naturally. *—Exegesis:* \"Without doing\" means concentrating the spirit in stillness, abandoning all action. \"Achieves\" refers to nurturing all beings and perfecting those who learn—this illustrates stillness in motion.\n\nFor those who study,\ndaily increase.\n*—Commentary:* \"Those who study\" refers to governance, teaching, rites, and music. \"Daily increase\" means emotional desires and ornamental excesses grow ever more.",

      "translated_text": "「○ *Exegesis:* \"For\" means cultivating and embellishing. \"Learn\" refers to mundane studies. It speaks of those who cultivate mundane learning—with sharp emotions and discriminating minds, their desires thus accumulate daily. \"For Dao daily diminishes\" means they act in accordance with the Way of Nature, causing their desires and embellishments to be daily eroded away.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* Those who study accumulate knowledge daily, while those who follow the Dao diminish their deeds. \"Accumulating knowledge\" is the gradual progression of mundane study, while \"diminishing deeds\" is the gateway to enlightenment. Thus, through accumulation, one cultivates virtue, and in forgetting virtue, one attains the Dao itself.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* \"For Dao\" means cultivating the Dao. It speaks of those who cultivate the Dao—with empty minds and tranquil ease, their wisdom and virtue gradually become clear, and their delusions daily dissipate. \"Diminish again, diminish again\" means diminishing desires once more, and again, so as to gradually eliminate them, until reaching the state of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n○ *Exegesis:* Those who study cling to desires, while those who follow the Dao are hindered by the notion of *wuwei*. Though their depths differ, both suffer afflictions. Now, to correct these two extremes, there is the text on diminishing and augmenting. First, diminish and diminish desires; later, diminish and diminish the fixation on *wuwei*. With both extremes dispelled, one attains the non-action of the central path. In non-action, there is nothing that is not done.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* This is the Dao of stillness in motion, of embodying yet applying—thus, there is nothing that is not done. The earlier section states: \"The Dao is ever *wuwei* yet ever *wuwei*.\" To govern the realm, one must always do so without exertion—never burdening the people with laborious tasks.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* \"Govern\" means to transform and guide. It speaks of those who transform and guide all under Heaven, leading them to goodness, always through *wuwei* and non-exertion. Though they respond to things and act accordingly, their minds remain undisturbed—this is stillness within motion. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Who is it that wears himself out, making things his business?\" When one truly has affairs, he is unfit to govern the realm.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* When his mind is not yet empty and forgetful, treating affairs as his business and thus having affairs, this is different from true *wuwei*. True *wuwei* is distinct from having affairs; motion differs from stillness, and stillness contradicts motion. Such a person is unfit to transform and guide the realm.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* The Sage has no mind—never altering his ways, valuing steadfastness, as if without mind. He takes the hearts of the people as his own—following what they find convenient.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* In embodying the Dao, he penetrates and forgets all things, his mind empty and free from thought, like still ashes. Thus, he has no mind. The people are all beings. Though the Sage has no mind, he responds to all stimuli—his responses follow the sensations of things. Hence, he takes the hearts of the people as his own, yet in having no mind, his responses are also without responses.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* \"The Sage’s heart is without heart, yet it responds to all stimuli.\" Thus, those who are already trustworthy, he trusts them; those who are not, he also trusts them. When the people’s virtue is good, the Sage’s virtue is also good. When the people are trustworthy, the Sage trusts them; when they are not, he also trusts them. When the people’s virtue is good, the Sage’s virtue is also good.\n\n○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* Those who desire goodness and trustworthiness, I follow them accordingly. Those who are not trustworthy, I also teach them goodness and trustworthiness, so that the people are moved by my virtue to become good and trustworthy.\n\n○ *Exegesis:* Trustworthiness means taking delight in hearing the *dharma* and precepts, while lack of trust means not rejoicing in the Dao’s teachings. The Sage, through empty practice and compassion, universally transforms and guides all beings equally, regardless of trust or doubt, so that all may benefit and universally awaken faith. Hence, the *Zhenji* of *Zhenwei* says: \"Trust is the key to gain or loss.\" The *sutra* also states: \"Trust is the pivot of learning the Dao.\"\n\nOne question: If the Sage has no mind, yet responds to all stimuli, and does not respond when there are none, then does he teach those who are trustworthy but not those who are not? Yet the text says that both trustworthy and untrustworthy are taught in the same way, and so too with stimuli and non-stimuli—all are responded to alike.\n\nThe answer: There is both universal and particular response. Like treating illness in the *Xuan Du* Palace of Jade Clarity, yet always saving the Three Realms—this is universal response. As for the barbarians who, upon sensing the *Zhi* of Purple Qi, receive the *Dao* from *Yin* the True Person—this is particular response.",

      "translated_text": "If the response is particular, it awaits particular stimuli; if universal, it is ever-present with boundless compassion. Hence the *sutra* says: *\"Ever saving all beings without abandoning any.\"*\n\n**Explication:**\nIt means that when a person is trustworthy, trust is one; when trust is one, it trusts the person. If a person does not trust the One, the One arises from the person, so the Dao ever attains its trust.\n\nThe Sage moves through the world with constant reverence—\n*Note:* The Sage, moving through the world, is ever reverent and fearful, never daring to indulge in arrogance or excess from wealth and honor.\n\n**Commentary:** *Reverence* (*chùchù*)—the form of ceaseless fear—speaks of having no mind to respond to stimuli.\n\nThe Sage, dwelling in the world, ever spreads great compassion, protecting and saving all beings, fearing they may perish or drown. Thus, he moves with constant reverence and fear.\n\nHe muddles the hearts of the people—\n*Note:* The Sage muddles the hearts of the common folk, as if making them dull and unknowing.\n\n**Commentary:** *Muddled* (*húntūn*)—without distinction. It speaks of how ordinary people, ensnared by emotions and entangled in the world, foolishly grasp at gain and loss. The Sage desires to muddle their hearts, leaving them without distinction, and this is the meaning of his constant fear and reverence.\n\nAll the people focus their ears and eyes—\n*Note:* *Focus* (*zhù*)—to use.\n\nAll the people use their ears and eyes as the Sage’s eyes and ears.\n\n**Commentary:** The *River Above* text reads *zhù* (focus), while other versions read *yín* (indulgence). *Indulgence* means to be stained and entangled; those who are deluded and inverted, lost in the world, give free rein to their ears and eyes, clinging to sounds and colors. Later, they drift adrift in endless wandering, accumulating faults day by day. The Sage pities their suffering, so he reveals their affliction.\n\nAmong the six senses, two are highlighted to show these two afflictions are the deepest.\nThus the *Sutra of Western Ascension* says: *\"Ears and eyes, sounds and colors—these are the children’s faults.\"* Yet by mentioning one sense, all senses are implied, for completeness’ sake.\n\nThe Sage treats them all like infants—\n*Note:* The Sage loves and cares for the people as if they were newborn children, nurturing them without expecting repayment.\n\n**Commentary:** Ordinary beings indulge their ears and eyes, drowning in the river of desire. The Sage, with constant fear and compassion, acts like one who pities infants, grieving their ignorance.\n\nThey are born and they die.\n*Note:* *Born*—when emotions arise from within, the spirit is settled, the soul is still, hence *born*. *Die*—when emotions enter the chest, the spirit is confused and agitated, hence *death*.\n\n**Commentary:** *Born*—transcending the Three Realms, free from birth and death.\n*Die*—sinking into the Three Paths, drowning in birth and death. If one understands the meaning of birth and death, it is from non-being to being, releasing *birth* as *birth*; from being back to non-being, releasing *extinction* as *death*.\n\nThere are thirteen kinds of those who are born, and thirteen kinds of those who die.\n*Note:* It speaks of the thirteen types of birth and death—namely, the nine orifices and four passages.\n\nIn their birth: the eyes do not gaze wantonly, the ears do not listen wantonly, the nose does not sniff wantonly, the mouth does not speak wantonly, the tongue does not taste wantonly, the hands do not grasp wantonly, the feet do not walk wantonly, the vital essence is not expended wantonly. In their death, it is the opposite.\n\n**Commentary:** *Kinds* (*tú*)—types. The nine orifices and four passages belong to both sages and ordinary beings. The Sage forgets them, thus transcending the Three Realms. Ordinary beings cling to them, thus entering the Six Paths. Entering the Six Paths is the kind of death; transcending the Three Realms is the kind of birth.\n\nA person’s life moves toward thirteen kinds of death.\n*Note:* When a person seeks life through action, it reverses into thirteen kinds of death.\n\n**Commentary:** When a person’s life is directed toward death, it is because they cling to these thirteen (senses), becoming entangled in the world before them.\n\nWhy is this so?\n*Note:* Asking why one moves toward death through action.\n\n**Commentary:** A rhetorical question, answered below.\n\nBecause their attachment to life is excessive.\n*Note:* The reason one moves toward death through action is that their pursuit of life is too heavy, contrary to the Dao and Heaven, acting recklessly and losing measure.\n\n**Commentary:** It speaks of how people cannot embody the Dao and forget life, instead clinging to life as real, accumulating wealth and resources, overindulging in life’s concerns, thus moving toward death. This sentence answers the prior question.\n\nIndeed, it is heard that those who skillfully nurture life—\n*Note:* *Nurture* (*shè*)—to guard, to nourish.\n\n**Commentary:** *Indeed*—not a direct answer, akin to *\"I have heard.\"* *Nurture*—to guard, to nourish. It speaks of how those who skillfully guard and nourish life are simple and unadorned, untouched by the world. The excellence of their guardianship is shown below.\n\nWhen walking on land, they avoid rhinoceroses and tigers—\n*Note:* Naturally avoiding harm, which does not reach them.\n\n**Commentary:** *Land*—flat ground. *Rhinoceros*—a poisonous beast with one horn, resembling a wild ox, green in color. It speaks of how those who nurture life skillfully are not harmed by poisonous beasts. Internally, it means they remain calm and undisturbed by afflictions in daily life.\n\nEntering battle, they are unharmed by armor and weapons—\n*Note:* They do not love war or killing.\n\n**Commentary:** It speaks of how those who nurture life do not enter battlefields and are not harmed by weapons. Internally, even if they enter the world, they are not injured by desires.\n\nRhinoceroses have no place to strike with their horns, tigers no place to place their claws, weapons no place to lodge their blades—\n*Note:* Those who nurture life skillfully are not injured by rhinoceroses or tigers, nor harmed by weapons.\n\n**Commentary:** Other texts say *zhù* (stationary). *Stationary*—to stand; *place*—to settle. Rhinoceroses, encountering objects, charge; this allegorizes the foolish. Tigers are fierce and violent; this allegorizes greed. Weapons are sharp and can harm people; this allegorizes gluttony. It speaks of how those who nurture life skillfully embody true emptiness, so even amid the world, they are unharmed by the Three Poisons.",

But those who practice life-nurturing skillfully forget bodily form—when form is forgotten, there is no ground for death. Without the ground of death, how could the Three Poisons take hold?*\n\n*—The Sage embraces spirit and unity, regulates qi and stabilizes the fetal breath, thus these creatures cannot harm them. The Dao dwells in the heart, and true qi abides—there is no ground for execution.*\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\nVirtue nurtures them,\nForm shapes them,\nMomentum completes them.\n\n*—The Dao generates all things. Virtue (unity) spreads qi and nurtures them.*\n\n*—The Supreme Dao is boundless and mysterious, generating all things; supreme virtue is compassionate and sustains all life—thus, \"the Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures.\"*\n\n*—It endows them with form and momentum to complete them.*\n\n*—Thus all things reverence the Dao and honor virtue.*\n\n*—All things arise from the Dao and virtue; hence, they are revered.*\n\n*—The Dao and virtue are honored not by titles but by their natural operation.*\n\n*—The Dao’s honor and virtue’s nobility require no artificial elevation—they are naturally so.*\n\nThus the Dao:\nGives birth to them,\nNurtures them,\nLengthens them,\nCultivates them,\nPerfects them,\nMatures them,\nSustains them,\nCovers them.\n\n*—The Dao’s work for all things is not merely to give birth but to lengthen, nurture, perfect, mature, sustain, and cover—fulfilling their nature and life.*\n\n*—This mirrors the ruler’s governance of state and self.*\n\n*—The text repeats earlier phrases to introduce what follows. The Dao is mentioned without virtue because virtue does not differ from the Dao, though the text is concise for brevity.*\n\nAs the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:\n*\"The Dao and virtue are indistinct and mysteriously unified.\"*\n\nLengthening refers to fostering their virtuous sprouts.\nCultivating refers to advancing their deeds.\nPerfecting and maturing refers to refining their hearts with supreme teachings, so their Dao is fulfilled and their virtue perfected—this echoes prior language to lead into the next passage.\nSustaining and covering: sustaining refers to rewarding their fruits; covering refers to sheltering with boundless compassion.\n\nThe four pairs above clarify the virtue of benefiting all things; the three below clarify the Dao’s self-effacing function.\n\nGiving birth yet not possessing,\nActing yet not relying,\nLengthening yet not controlling—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\n*—The Dao’s operation is an unfathomable benevolence, invisible yet profound.*\n\n*—This refers to the passage above, introducing what follows. \"Mysterious\" denotes depth; \"virtue\" signifies protective fulfillment. It points to those who embody the Dao, benefiting others while forgetting their own deeds, guiding people with the law—truly Mysterious Virtue.*\n\n*—The Dao is the apex of yang, yang being heaven. Heaven moves, thus generating all things. Virtue is the apex of yin, yin being earth; earth encompasses, thus nurturing all things. Receiving qi is birth; nurturing form is sustenance—the forms and momentum of all things. Perfecting refers to completing them through their deeds and momentum, forming human shape.*\n\n*—The Dao endows all beings with the four seasonal rhythms, completing all things—this explanation precedes.*\n\nAt the origin of all things lies the Dao,\nWhich becomes the mother of all under heaven.\n\n*—The origin is the subtle black of primordial harmony; this mysterious qi generates all things with nourishing virtue, thus it can be the mother of all under heaven.*\n\n*—The Dao is the primordial mother; this is its description.

originate from the Dao.\"*\n\nWhen it says *\"the mother of all under heaven,\"*\nIt means the Dao descends from its origin,\nGuiding and nurturing the teeming multitude,\nCultivating and fostering them,\nLike a mother’s love for her child,\nHence the Upper Classic says: *\"The Dao that bears a name is the mother of all things.\"*\n\n*—Cai says: \"Origin\" is the root.*\nAll beings are sunk in the Five Desires,*\nIgnorant of their root and origin,\nDriven by the current, chasing after trivial ends,\nFloating through life and death.\nThus the Venerable Lord Laozi raises the root to show them,\nIlluminating that the world possesses the Clear and Void Qi as Virtue and Power,\nAs your root and origin.\nMoreover, the origin has no predecessor,\nThe mother has merit,\nTaking the Dao’s role in generating life,\nThus it is called *\"origin.\"*\nThe nurturing merit is then called *\"mother.\"*\n\nHaving known its mother,\nOne must also know its child.\n*—The child is Unity.*\nHaving known the Dao,\nOne must also know Unity.\n\n*—Yu says: When all things have received the Clear Qi’s nurturing virtue,*\nAnd know their own bodies,\nThat is the Clear Qi’s child.\n\n*—Cui says: The root can generate form,*\nThe mother can generate life.\nHaving known that the Dao is my mother,\nI know that I am the Dao’s child,\nBorn from the Dao.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"The Void and Natural is the true parent.\"*\nHaving known its child,\nOne must again safeguard its mother,\n*—Safeguarding Unity,*\nOne must again safeguard the Dao,\nReturning to Non-Action.*\n\n*—Cai says: Having known that I am the Dao’s child,*\nAnd thus obtain life,\nI must safeguard the Clear and Tranquil Non-Action,\nReturning to its mother,\nThus merging with the Dao.\nThe body will not perish.\n*—It will not be endangered.*\n\n*—Yu says: Having known that the body is the Clear Qi’s child,*\nOne must safeguard this Clear and Harmonious Qi,\nPreventing its dispersion,\nThen the body will not perish,\nAnd its danger will not manifest.\n\n*—Cui says: Having known that I am the Dao’s child,*\nI must return and safeguard its mother.\nBut if one can return to the root and safeguard the mother,\nSafeguarding the Dao to attain Truth,\nThough the forms may appear or vanish,\nThe origin remains undangerous and unendangered.\nWhy so?\nThe Dao can generate life,\nThe Dao is the origin.\nLife arises from the Dao,\nLife is the trivial end.\nYet the trivial end can encompass the origin,\nThus one must return to its mother.\nThe mother can generate the child,\nThus one must safeguard its mother.\nSafeguarding the mother brings enduring vision and longevity,\nReturning to the root ensures the body’s safety,\nHence the exhortation.\n\nThe *Xisheng Classic* says: *\"Constantly nurturing the mother, one can endure long.\"*\n\nClose the *Fu* (eyes),\n*—Preventing the eyes from viewing indiscriminately.*\nShut the *Men* (mouth),\n*—Preventing the mouth from speaking indiscriminately.*\n*—Cui says: Though the text above exhorts safeguarding the mother,*\nIt has not yet shown the method of cultivation and safeguarding,\nThus the following passage fully displays the means of safeguarding and returning,\nIncluding closing and shutting.*\n\n*Fu* is the mouth,\n*—Yet among the Six Roots,*\nThe *Fu* is singled out,\nRevealing that the Yang River* is both the Three Activities and the Six Roots,\nAnd its sins are manifold.\n*Men* refers to the Five Gates.\nClosing the Five Gates,\n*—Preventing contamination by dustly realms.*\nThe previous mention of *Fu* was a distinction among the roots,\nNow *Men* is the comprehensive root.\n\nBut the meaning of closing and shutting has two aspects:\nOne is to sever desires and endure colors,\nTo take refuge in mountains and forests,\nOr to turn away and shut the gates,\n*—Not seeing what is desirable.*\nTwo is to understand that the Six Dusts are illusory and insubstantial,\nThe roots are not true,\nWithin, there is no heart capable of contamination,\nWithout, there are no desirable realms.\nThus, though one’s eyes see and ears hear to their utmost,\nOne remains ever in the Dao’s realm,\nNot straying from the True,\nHow could one say that plugging ears and closing eyes is closing and shutting?\nNo, it is not so—\nThis is the wondrous essence of closing and shutting.\n\nAll one’s life, one is not weary.\n*—When humans close their eyes to prevent indiscriminate viewing,*\nAnd shut their mouths to prevent indiscriminate speaking,\nThey will not toil all their lives.*\n\n*—Cui says: \"Weary\" means labor and suffering.*\nThe Dao has many paths,\nThe gates are not singular;\nSome still the heart to avoid dustly realms,\nSome dwell in realms to grasp the True Source,\nDeep and shallow entanglements,\nIndeed manifold.\n\nThus the *Xisheng Classic* says: *\"Action brings calamity, and the self is burdened—*\nThis is the utmost toil and suffering.\"\nBut if one follows the earlier closing and shutting,\nDwelling in realms while attaining the True,\nThe heart’s nature is at ease and broad,\nFree from labor and fatigue,\nThus one can live out the years,\nAnd not weary all their lives.\n\nOpen the *Fu* (eyes),\n*—To indulge in the Five Desires’ gates,*\nAnd aid the Six Dusts’ affairs,\n*—The heart and spirit grow inwardly exhausted,*\nThe ears and eyes are outwardly strained,\nAll one’s life in labor and fatigue.*\n\nAll one’s life, one is not saved.\n*—Calamity is accomplished.*\n\n*—Cui says: When the foolish act thus,*\nThey open the eyes and ears,\nAssisting in sound and color,\nAll their lives entangled,\nPerishing in lust,\nEven the Great Sage and Great Compassionate\nCould not save them from this fate.*\n\nSeeing small is called *Ming* (clear).\n*—When sprouts are yet unseen and calamity not yet revealed,*\nThat is the small and manifest,\nOnly seeing is called *Ming* (clear).*\n\n*—Yu says: When humans, at the onset of affairs,*\nSee the small and change their conduct,\nThis can be called *Ming* (clear).*\n\n*—Cui says: \"Seeing\" is observation and illumination,*\n\"Small\" is the name for the minute and subtle.\nThe utmost subtle principle,\nSpeaking that humans, if they but observe the subtle realm,\nWill daily increase in wisdom and clarity,\nHence the Upper Classic says: *\"Observe its subtlety.\"*\nSafeguarding softness brings daily strength.\n*—Cui says: Having seen the small,*\nWisdom and clarity increase,\nAnd one can apply the Dao,\nKnowing softness as well,\nThus one’s virtue and deeds grow daily stronger.\nAt the start of learning,\nThere is steadiness and benefit,\nThere is practice and understanding,\nSeeing the small is the gate to benefit and steadiness,\nApplying softness is the extension of practice and understanding.\nThus among the Six Perfections,\nThere is practice and understanding,\nThe first five are practice,\nThe last is understanding,\nUnderstanding is benefit and emptiness,\nPractice encompasses both emptiness and substance,\nUsing substance to guide emptiness,\nUsing emptiness to aid substance,\nDesiring to clarify the ability of guidance and aid,\nThus it is said: \"Apply softness, see the small.\"*",

were to be upright and boast of my knowledge,\nDesiring to walk the Great Dao,\nYet it does not align with the Dao,\nThus only what is applied is to be feared.\n○ *Commentary:* \"使我\" (*shǐ wǒ*—*If

discrimination,\nTo knowingly walk the Dao,\nThis is deeply unfit.\nWhy?\nThe Ultimate Dao is empty and boundless,\nIts mysteries surpass all discrimination—\nNeither true nor false,\nNeither real nor unreal,\nTrue and false share the same nature,\nDeath and life are the same offering.\nEntering the Nine Abysses without confusion,\nExiting the Three Realms without distinction,\nTreading dangers yet ever secure,\nConfronting great calamities without fear.\nNow, to arise with discrimination,\nTo deviate from the Ultimate Dao—\nAll actions lead to the path of death,\nThus they are to be

love of deceit and falsehood,\nAnd their reckless pursuit of shortcuts.\n\n*—Morning is most refined,*\n*—Cui says:* High palaces and pavilions,\nElaborate halls and chambers.\n○ *Commentary:* The ruler without Dao\nLoves devious paths,\nDoes not uphold simplicity,\nOnly values luxury and excess—\nThen he demolishes his old halls,\nRaises new palaces,\nCarves pillars and beams,\nExhausts all ornate beauty.\n\n*—Fields are most overgrown,*\n*—Cui says:* Agriculture neglected,\nUnplowed and uncultivated,\nWasting the seasons.\n○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of people not refining their inner nature,\nBut instead adorning themselves morning and evening,\nThus generating illness—\nTheir hearts become wild and unclean.\n○ *Commentary:* With taxes and labor burdens heavy,\nFarmers abandon their work—\nThe eastern slopes lie fallow,\nThe southern fields overgrown with weeds.\n\n*—Granaries are most empty,*\n*—Cui says:* The five grains are harmed,\nThe state has no reserves.\n○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of not guarding the inner constancy,\nThus the five *zang* organs are depleted—\nHence it says *empty*.\n○ *Commentary:* Harvests decline,\nThe state has no wealth—\nThe loom and spindle lie idle,\nGranaries are left bare.\n\n*—Wearing embroidered silks,*\n*—Cui says:* Loving false adornment,\nValuing external splendor.\n*—And carrying sharp

says:* Excessive desires,\nNever knowing contentment.\n○ *Commentary:* Brocade and embroidery adorn the body,\nGanjiang and Moye guard the life,\nSweet wine and rich meats delight the palate—\nYet they do not exalt the superior virtue,\nNor care for the common people.\nAlas, the gluttonous and greedy!\nThey reach this extreme.\n\n*—Wealth and goods are in excess,*\nThis is called *plundering and boasting.*\n*—Cui says:* The people lack sufficient means,\nYet the ruler has excess—\nThis is due to robbing and plundering\nFor his adornments and extravagance,\nHolding displays to boast before others,\nUnknowing that death and ruin will follow,\nAnd his kin will perish with him.\n\n*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of loving sweet and fatty foods\nTo nourish the body,\nYet abandoning the

      "translated_text": "War harms itself. A state is like the body. To take the world without action—\n*—Annotation:* To appoint those who act without doing as rulers of the world.\n\n*—Exegesis:* Governing the world through non-action is most noble. If one uses laws and teachings to rule, or deceit and stratagem in war, these are all contrary to the Dao. Only through non-action and non-doing can one take the world.\n\n*—Commentary:* The Way of governance adapts to circumstances like a passing shelter or a sacrificial dog—if grasped too tightly, it only increases harm. Better to remain in non-action, centered in the *Gushu* [1], neither wielding arms nor culture, yet ruling from the hall of state with effortless ease. Thus, things transform without blemish, and the people sing in harmony. The art of governance lies here.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus? By this.\n*—Annotation:* *This*, meaning the present—Laozi says, \"How do I know the will of heaven is so?\" I know it by what I see today.\n\n*—Exegesis:* *This* refers to the reasoning below.\n\n*—Commentary:* The argument assumes: \"How do I know that governing the world must be through non-action?\" The reasoning below reveals it.\n\nThe more taboos a land enforces, the poorer its people grow.\n*—Annotation:* *Land* refers to the ruler; *taboos* mean prohibitions. Excessive restrictions breed deceit, and many prohibitions make the people cunning, deceiving one another for survival—thus poverty.\n\n*—Explanation:* This speaks of artificial governance.\n\n*—Commentary:* Harsh laws multiply offenders, disrupting livelihoods and deepening poverty.\n\nThose who govern themselves cannot follow their true nature but cling to prohibitions, lacking inner virtue—thus poverty.\n\nWhen the people wield many tools, the state grows confused.\n*—Annotation:* *Tools* means *power*—when the people hold much power, their vision is dazzled, their ears deceived, and trust between ruler and subjects erodes, leading to chaos.\n\n*—Exegesis:* *Tools* refers to schemes. If rulers rely too much on cunning, the people respond with deceit, deepening the state’s confusion.\n\nWhen people rely on cleverness, strange devices proliferate.\n*—Annotation:* *People* refers to rulers and feudal lords who favor cleverness—engraving palaces, carving garments—so strange devices arise, and the people below imitate, adorning gold and jade, embroidering colors, endlessly innovating.\n\n*—Commentary:* *Cleverness* means deceitful schemes. *Strange devices* are war machines. If rulers favor war, the people follow, inventing strange devices to earn glory. Those who govern themselves indulge in cleverness, seizing others’ lands, and their divisive hearts only worsen corruption. This sentence further explains the use of war.\n\nWhen laws proliferate, thieves multiply.\n*—Annotation:* *Laws* means luxuries. If luxuries abound, farming declines, and hunger and cold follow—thus thieves multiply.\n\n*—Exegesis:* Having lost non-action, laws become stricter, and those who exploit them become thieves—how could they not multiply?\n\n*—Honor’s Note:* Luxuries are what laws protect.

      "translated_text": "The *Commentary* states: **\"以\"** means **\"to employ.\"** **\"下\"** means **\"humility.\"** **\"取\"** means **\"to assimilate and transform.\"** The Sage-King, ruling over great states, skillfully employs humility and gentleness, thus assimilating all nations—near and far—into submission, bringing tribute through layered tributaries. Is this not fitting?\n\nWhen small states humble themselves to great states, they gather under their protection.\n*—Annotation:* This means that regardless of a state’s size, if it practices humility and nurtures others, it will have no faults.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* The great state takes the small as its subjects and servants; the small state takes the great as its allies and support.\n\n*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* The *Upper Seal* (泥丸) represents the great state, while the *Lower Elixir Field* (丹田) represents the small. Practicing the *One Way*, one closes the breath and swallows saliva, letting it descend to the *Lower Elixir Field*, where it transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into *qi*. Through embryonic breathing, it is drawn upward to replenish the brain, then pushed and drawn outward, spreading like clouds across the four seas. Thus, the great takes from the small, and the small gathers under the great.\n\nThe small state, knowing its own lowliness, guards its place with feminine gentleness, gathering within the great state out of reverence for its virtue and moral influence.\n\nThus, sometimes the great takes, sometimes the small gathers.\n*—Annotation:* **\"下\"** refers to the great state humbling itself to the small, and the small humbling itself to the great, alternately taking each other through righteousness.\n\n*—Commentary:* **\"或\"** means **\"indeterminate\"**—when the small state employs gentleness, it gathers under the great; when the great employs humility, it takes the submission of all nations. Though both use humility, their methods differ—one gathers, the other takes.\n\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others; the small state seeks only to enter and serve.\n*—Annotation:* If the great state does not lose its humility, it will encompass and assimilate the small, making them its subjects and servants.\n\n*—Commentary:* The great state employs humility without ulterior motives—only to love and embrace the small states. The small state employs gentleness without hidden intentions—only to enter the great state’s embrace, admiring its virtue and seeking to serve.\n\nBoth achieve what they desire: the great state should thus be humble.\n*—Annotation:* Great and small states each seek what they desire, yet the great state should especially practice humility.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* One seeks subjects and servants; the other seeks allies and support. Both obtain what they desire, yet the great state must always guard against arrogance, hence it should be humble.\n\n*—Commentary:* The two refer to great and small states—both encompassing and serving, each fulfilling their desires. Though both may use gentleness, the great state should particularly emphasize humility. Why? For things naturally press down the great—small things do not overpower the great. Thus, those who overpower the great should humble themselves, adhering to the principle of lowering the high.\n\n*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* The two refer to the *Upper Seal* (泥丸) and the *Lower Elixir Field* (丹田). The *Upper Seal* desires descending *qi*, while the *Lower Elixir Field* desires ascending *qi*, together forming a single divine transformation.\n\nThe *Dao* is the profound essence of all things.\n*—Annotation:* **\"奥\"** means **\"to conceal.\"** The *Dao* is the hidden repository of all things, containing all within itself.\n\n*—Commentary:* The *Dao* is the wondrous, boundless principle of emptiness and flow, the innate nature of all beings. **\"奥\"** means both **\"profound\"** and **\"hidden\"**—it speaks of the *Dao* generating all existence, encompassing all life, without exclusion, thus serving as the hidden repository of all things.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\n*—Annotation:* The virtuous person regards the *Dao* as their bodily treasure, thus daring not to stray from it.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* The virtuous know that adherence to the *Dao* brings flourishing, while abandonment brings ruin. Thus, they cherish and practice it without ceasing.\n\n*—Commentary:* Those who cultivate the *Dao* perceive true nature, obtaining the *Mystic Pearl* in the *Crimson Stream*, hence they treasure and honor it.\n\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n*—Annotation:* The *Dao* is the unvirtuous’ last reliance. Even in calamity or peril, they may yet repent and humble themselves.\n\n*—Commentary:* **\"保\"** means **\"to uphold.\"** The vulgar, entangled in material desires and competitive striving, cannot uphold the *Dao*. Their speech is flattering and deceitful, like market haggling—buyers seek swift purchase, sellers swift sale. Unable to guard true humility, they prioritize self over others, yet still claim noble conduct, thus distancing themselves from the *Dao*.\n\nSweet speech can be sold in the market,\n*—Annotation:* Only sweet speech can be traded in the marketplace. Once the exchange is complete, the buyer and seller part ways—no further harmony remains. Sweet words and flattery are sought eagerly by buyers, swiftly sold by merchants.\n\nNoble conduct can elevate a person.\n*—Annotation:* **\"加\"** means **\"to distinguish.\"** A person of noble conduct can set themselves apart from the common, yet this is insufficient to elevate the *Dao*.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* Sweet and pleasing words can be traded like goods in the market; noble and lofty conduct can distinguish a person. By analogy, the Sage uses sweet, virtuous teachings and lofty, detached conduct to transform the unvirtuous—just as merchants sell goods, people follow in emulation.\n\n*—Commentary:* The unvirtuous, with shallow hearts and hollow speech, adorn themselves with flattery like market traders seeking profit, yet they cannot uphold true humility. They place themselves before others, boast of their own nobility, and domineer over people. Such conduct, far from the *Dao*, only distances them further.\n\nWhy abandon those who are unvirtuous?\n*—Annotation:* Though unvirtuous, they should be transformed by the *Dao*. In the age of the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue and teaching were pure.\n\n*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* Even the unvirtuous can be transformed by virtue. Why abandon them?\n\n*—Commentary:* **\"奚\"** means **\"why.\"** The Sage’s *Dao* is boundless in its reach, universally salvific. Though beings may be unvirtuous, how could there be abandonment? Its compassion covers all, aiding without exclusion.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is enthroned,\nand the Three Ministers are appointed,\n*—Annotation:* To transform the unvirtuous through teaching.\n\n*—Commentary:* Having aided without exclusion, the proper order of the world must be established. Thus, the Son of Heaven is enthroned to govern all affairs, and the Three Ministers are appointed to discuss the *Dao*.\n\nTo harmonize *Yin* and *Yang*,\nand to refine and flourish in governance,\nwith intent on guiding all classes like a vessel,\nand protecting all life from poison.",

Its profound enlightenment resides within me. Would one only seek to avoid guilt when already guilty? ○Annotations: \"Guilt\" refers to suffering in turbulent times under tyrannical rulers, where arbitrary punishments prevail. Cultivating the *Dao* can resolve resentment and spare one from the evils of the multitude. ○Kumarajiva and others say: By dedicating oneself to the virtuous *Dao*, one avoids all evils.

Hence, it is worthy of the world’s reverence. ○Master Yu notes: The *Dao* lies in enlightenment, not in seeking. Unlike wealth or silk, which can be sought daily and obtained, it is said that one does not seek it daily to attain it. Once enlightened, there is no burden of guilt—why wait for guilt to arise before seeking release? Thus, it is worthy of the world’s reverence.\n\n○Exegesis: Why did the sages of old hold this *Dao* so precious? Simply because it is not a matter of seeking it day by day to obtain it.

The clinger seeks possession, yet reason dictates loss.\n\nThe *Commentary* explains: The Supreme Dao is empty and boundless, without action or attachment. Worldly minds are inverted, with attachment and contrivance. Action leads to peril, hence \"ruin\"; clinging contradicts reality, hence \"loss.\"\n\nThus, the Sage acts not, and so knows no ruin;\n*Annotation*: The Sage does not indulge in superficial adornments, nor covet material gains or harm others, and thus knows no corruption.\n\nacts not in clinging, and so knows no loss.\n*Annotation*: The Sage teaches the ignorant with virtue and aids the poor with wealth, holding nothing back, and thus loses nothing to others.\n\nYet the people, in their pursuits, often nearing completion, bring ruin upon themselves.\n*Annotation*: \"From\" means \"to act.\" The people’s affairs, nearing fulfillment, grow greedy for position and fame, indulgent in excess, and thus self-destruct.\nThe *Commentary* states: \"Near\" means \"close.\" All people engage in contrived endeavors, restless and competitive, distinguishing and selecting without foresight. Ever seeking near-completion, they begin but do not finish, hence their frequent ruin.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: Few have beginnings, but fewer still have endings.\nTo be as vigilant at the end as at the beginning brings no ruin.\n*Annotation*: The end must mirror the beginning; do not grow slack.\n\nThe *Commentary* warns: This admonishes learners to fortify their Dao-heart, steadfast from beginning to end, lest there be ruin. Within the Six Perfections, this is the fourth.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not;\n*Annotation*: The Sage desires what others reject—when others seek display, the Sage hides brilliance; when others seek ornamentation, the Sage seeks simplicity; when others lust after wealth and form, the Sage seeks virtue and power.\n\nvalues not the hard-to-obtain treasures;\n*Annotation*: The Sage does not dazzle with adornments nor devalue stone while esteeming jade.\n\nlearns what others do not learn;\n*Annotation*: The Sage learns what others cannot—while others learn cunning, the Sage learns spontaneity; while others learn to govern the world, the Sage learns to govern the self, guarding the true Dao.\n\nand reverses the errors of the multitude.\n*Annotation*: The multitude learns in reverse—errors become ends, reality becomes superficial. To reverse is to restore the original and true.\n\nThe *Master’s Response* says: The Sage does not seek excessive learning.\n\nThe *Commentary* elaborates: The Sage’s luminous insight comes from Heaven, differing from common wisdom. Knowing all phenomena as empty and illusory, no desirable object appears. Thus, within desire, no desire-form is seen. Having no desire for what others desire, how could jade and silk be valued?\n\nFurther, comprehending true and false as undifferentiated, the Sage neither learns nor fails to learn. Learning is not learning, and not-learning is learning—no distinction between learning and not-learning. Hence, the *Western Ascension Sutra* says: *\"I learn nothing, yet I illuminate spontaneity.\"*\n\nThe *River-Upper* text reads *\"reverse,\"* while other editions say *\"prevent.\"*[^2] To prevent is to guard against the calamities of those who cling to contrivance, unable to forget learning.\n\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\n*Annotation*: Teaching people to return to their original and true nature, desiring to assist the natural essence of all things.\n\nyet daring not to act.\n*Annotation*: The Sage’s movements follow naturally, daring not to contrive, lest they stray from the root.\n\nThe *Commentary* explains: \"Aid\" means \"assist\" and \"guide.\" All beings inherently possess a correct and natural disposition, yet delusion and attachment cause them to stray from the Dao and lose authenticity.

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Annotation (节解):** The Way speaks of what common folk desire—purity and cleanliness as supreme, fragrance and beauty as highest—yet the Dao takes receiving filth as its master, dwelling in the low to rule. This is said to be contrary to the world.\n\n**Annotation (御):** Though the words appear contrary to common custom, why? The world loves beauty and honor, yet now it is said to receive filth and misfortune—thus it seems contrary. But *\"if\"* (若) is used to clarify that what is contrary is not fixed opposition: though it seems contrary, it is always in harmony with the Way. Though it appears contrary, it remains true, conforming to the world’s nature while transcending it. Though it seems contrary, it is not truly contrary—this is why *\"if\"* is added.\n\nEarlier, it was said that the **Way’s virtue** is profound and far-reaching, contrary to things, and then it attains great harmony—this is its meaning.\n\nTo reconcile great grievances,\n**Annotation (御):** *\"To reconcile\"* (和) means to harmonize. The greatest grievance against oneself is **emotional desire** (情欲). The ruler seeks to guide the people through speech, harmonizing their desires so that none remain—thus it is said, *\"To reconcile great grievances.\"*\n\nThere must be lingering grievances.\n**Annotation (御):** When laws are established, traces of governance remain, and these traces become grievances that affect the common people.\n**Annotation (疏):** Grievances are **discriminative perceptions** (慧). They are all **dharma** that awaits opposition—whether of existence or non-existence. Though one may discard the extremes of existence and non-existence, attain neither existence nor non-existence, and harmonize the two edges into the **middle path** (中一), one still clings to **emptiness** (玄), failing to penetrate its true essence. Though this is **non-attachment** (无待), it cannot fully escape **attachment** (不待). This is **selective attachment** (待独), not yet **absolute freedom** (独独)—thus lingering oppositions persist.\n\nHow can this be considered good?\n**Annotation (御):** If lingering grievances remain, it cannot be considered good.\n**Annotation (疏):** *\"How\"* (安) means *\"why.\"* Though one may discard the two extremes, one still clings to the middle—why can it not be fully good?\n\n**Annotation (节解):** This refers to the mouth. When one sings, there must be response. If people practice the Dao, the Dao will come to meet them. When one sings of goodness, the good will respond in harmony—then there will be no lingering grievances. But people of today indulge in **evil thoughts** (邪想). Evil thoughts follow them, and they call upon **evil spirits** (邪鬼). The spirits come to respond, and when one sings of evil, the evil harmonizes—how can such a thing be considered good?\n\nThus, the Sage holds the **left契** (left契),\n**Annotation (御):** The left契 is the **heart** (心). The heart is the **yang viscera** (阳藏), binding with the present realm (境) to establish trust—thus it is called the left契. The Sage knows that establishing guidance will inevitably leave traces, and traces will breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he upholds this heart, making it pure and tranquil, and transforms the people below, so that they have no desires. Without need for punishment or blame, the heart naturally aligns with **non-action** (无为).\n\n**Annotation (疏):** 契 is **trust** (信) and **harmony** (合). Left is **yang** (阳). The Sage’s heart, dwelling in **Dao/Way**, resonates with **wisdom** (智), in perfect accord. Through this, he can make all things harmonize, transcending the myriad faults. Thus, he attains the meaning of **longevity and eternal vision** (久视长生).\n\nTo hold the left契 is to not hold yet hold. Like an emperor grasping the left契, by which he governs all affairs, the Sage holds the **perfect契** within the cycle, thus able to guide the myriad multitudes. And when it is said that he does not blame, though he may guide all beings, he forgets their faults. The people are like **sacrificial dogs** (刍狗), and he does not blame them for their shortcomings.\n\n**Annotation (节解):** The left契 is **yang virtue** (阳德). The Sage does not reconcile great grievances but only cultivates his own virtue, never blaming others for their faults. Thus, the virtuous ruler governs through **trust and harmony** (司契), while the unvirtuous ruler governs through **traces and laws** (司彻).\n**Annotation (疏):** 司 means **to govern** (主), and 彻 means **traces** (迹). The Sage’s perfect契 does not cling to discriminative words. The unvirtuous ruler, however, remains stuck in the **nets of governance** (筌蹄), unable to fully transcend them. Since traces are not erased, it is said that he governs through **traces** (司彻).\n\n**Annotation (节解):** This refers to people practicing **moral cultivation** (行道德). The **Heavenly Command** (司命) bestows their **fate** (算). If people practice evil, the Command will **kill and destroy their records** (同杀彻其籍)—this is its meaning.\n\nThe **Heavenly Dao** has no favorites, always aligning with the good.\n**Annotation (疏):** The **natural principle** (天真) of the Dao knows no favoritism. Those of **highest virtue** (上善) naturally harmonize with it—just as before, the Sage held the left契 without blaming others.\n\n**Small realms, few people** (小国寡民).\n**Annotation (御):** Though the Sage may govern great realms, he still regards them as small, teaching **frugality** (俭约) and avoiding **extravagance** (奢泰). Though the people are many, they are treated as if few, not daring to burden or exploit them.\n\n**Annotation (疏):** Realm (国) is **domain** (域). The heart dwells in **emptiness** (空)—thus it is said *\"small realm.\"* This is the practice of **Hinayana** (小乘) and **few desires** (寡欲). Instruments (器) are the **weapons of the hundred** (什恶兵器). Though the six **roots** (根) exist, their use is **unexhausted** (不穷). When it is said *\"the hundred and the ten\"* (什伯), it refers to the greater numbers. *\"Not using\"* (不用) means **resting the roots** (息诸根), not staining them with the dust of the world.\n\n**Annotation (御):** 什 is **the five** (伍), and 伯 is **the great** (长). This chapter clarifies that people are **naturally harmonious** (含淳和), without seeking or demanding. When there are those whose talents and capacities fit to be **leaders of the five or the ten** (什伍伯长), they are still not **used** (用).",
