  "full_translation": "**Wang Fuzhi’s *Expounding the Laozi*: Preface**\n\nThose who annotated the *Laozi* in former times belonged to different schools, each transmitting divergent interpretations. By the time of Wang Bi and He Yan, they conflated it with the *Book of Changes*’ principles of qian and kun, simplicity and ease; Kumārajīva and Emperor Wu of Liang diluted it with the Buddhist doctrines of cause and effect in affairs and principles. Such forced patchwork and arbitrary synthesis have long been distortions. Down to Lu Xisheng, Su Ziyou, Dong Sijing, and more recently Jiao Hong and Li Zhi, they increasingly drew from Chan Buddhism, stitching it together with Laozi’s teachings, blending what they called \"a special transmission outside the teachings.\" This is like the people of Min mistaking frost for snow, or those of Luo peeling a *pengqi* upon hearing of eating crabs.\n\nLaozi himself said: \"Carry your *po* and embrace the One without separation,\" \"The great Dao overflows, drifting left or right,\" and \"Use the harmonizing *qi* of the void.\" These are Laozi’s own explanations. Zhuangzi said: \"Do good without seeking fame, do evil without courting punishment, follow the central path as your constant.\" This is Zhuangzi’s elucidation of Laozi.\n\nTo abandon these clear expositions and forcibly align Confucianism with the Dao is to slander the Confucians; to forcibly align the Dao with Buddhism is to slander the Dao. Such interpreters drive worldly teachings to serve their own doctrines of \"turning away from dust and merging consciousness,\" becoming pests that endure. How can this be tolerated?\n\nHaving long examined these distortions, I now set aside all previous schools to expound Laozi’s meaning. It is like entering their fortress, seizing their supplies, exposing their defenses, and revealing their flaws. Only by seeing their flaws can the Dao be restored.\n\nWhat, then, are these flaws? Those who discourse on the Dao often provoke the vulgar by deliberately opposing them—this is unjust; they seize upon partial insights and cling to them—this is unprincipled; they hack at wisdom and flaunt it—this is inauspicious. Laozi’s teachings suffer from all three errors. Thus, compared to the sagely Dao, which is adorned with ritual and music to establish the ultimate of central harmony, Laozi’s depth is insufficient.\n\nNevertheless, as the world shifts and the Dao is lost, collapse and ruin follow in quick succession. Those who cling to texts drift into hypocrisy and theft; those who obscure the subtle portents become harbingers of disaster. Rulers who govern the world stir up trouble to exhaust the people; those who seize the world deplete their strength and wisdom to ruin their subjects. If we probe Laozi’s subtleties to await the Dao’s self-restoration, there is still hope. The rise of Emperors Wen and Jing led to lasting peace; Zhang Zifang and Sun Zhonghe, though differing in their pursuits, averted peril. Such is the use of this teaching. Compared to Buddhism’s desolate harshness, which ultimately leads to entanglement in thorns, recklessly discarding the principles of things to seek fleeting marvels, is this not the wiser path?\n\nSima Qian said: \"Laozi practiced non-action and transformed naturally; he purified himself and rectified naturally.\" This is close to the truth. As for the \"like a dragon\" praise attributed to Confucius’ disciples, what value does it hold?\n\nWritten in the year *zhanmeng xieqia*, the eighth month, day *yiwei*, by Wang Fuzhi of Nanyue.\n\n**Chapter One**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\n*[The eternal Dao is without Dao.]*\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\n*[The eternal name is without name.]*\nThe nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth;\n*[All names arise from it, yet it cannot be named by any single name.]*\nThe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\n*[Names are established by things, and names in turn generate things.]*\nThus, in constant non-being, one observes its mystery;\nIn constant being, one observes its manifestations.\n*[Its boundaries.]*\nThese two emerge together but differ in name.\n*[Different observations of the same constant: whether with desire or without, one does not divide the mind to respond. Abiding in the center and holding to the constant, one naturally attains the observation of mystery and manifestation.]*\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and again profound—\nThe gate of all mysteries.\n\n**Commentary on Chapter One**\n\nWhat is \"can be\" is not \"eternal\"; what is \"eternal\" has no \"can be.\" Yet if we rely on the \"eternal,\" then the \"eternal\" is one \"can be.\" Thus, the \"eternal\" is not abandoned, yet there is nothing that \"can be.\" By not abandoning the \"eternal,\" human mechanisms are connected; by having nothing that \"can be,\" the harmony of heaven is unified.\n\nSince there is already a \"beginning\" and a \"mother,\" I casually \"observe\" them. To \"observe\" is to ride upon their inevitability. Observing their \"difference,\" there are countless transformations; observing their \"sameness,\" what exists arises later, and what is non-existent is not the great beginning. Thus, those who respond by going forth see difference; those who abide and await see sameness.\n\nTherefore, one consumes the ten thousand things without claiming benevolence; one enters the realm of artifice without encountering its sharpness. Knowing the world’s conditions, one does not force others to serve oneself; discarding one’s own excess, one does not cling to the old to confuse the new.\n\nThus, none can name its achievement, yet we style it \"the host of mysteries\"—for in dwelling within the grasp of meaning, opening the gate to traverse the hundred transformations of life and death, how fitting it is!\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises. Being and non-being give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low fill each other; sound and voice harmonize each other; front and back follow each other. These are the eternal knowables of all under heaven. Therefore, the sage abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words. [It is not that he does not allow all under heaven to know, but rather that he follows what cannot be known.] The ten thousand things arise yet he does not initiate; they live yet he does not possess; he acts yet does not rely; achievements are completed yet he does not dwell. Only because he does not dwell, they do not depart.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nThough the changes of all under heaven are myriad, they ultimately return to two ends. These two ends arise from one source—thus, when there is \"beauty,\" there is also \"ugliness\"; when there is \"goodness,\" there is also \"not-goodness.\" If one clings to the one to encompass the other’s non-unity, then black and white contend, and praise and blame intermingle. The sage’s \"embracing of the One\" lies in this: when the one and the other become two, he slowly abides in the center. Thus, when that one and this one stand as fortresses, he knows their foundation is without fortress—then sits and gathers them in. The fortress-builder \"dwells,\" while the one who sits and gathers \"does not depart.\" This is called skillful contention.\n\nDo not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend. Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal. Do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be confused. Therefore, in the sage’s governance, he empties their hearts [using the useless to employ the without], fills their bellies [using the useful to employ the with], weakens their ambitions [entering the ten thousand things with skill], and strengthens their bones [planting them to await]. He constantly ensures the people are without knowledge and without desire. He causes the wise not to dare act. By acting through non-action, there is nothing left ungoverned.\n\n**Chapter Three**\nContention does not necessarily arise from \"worthiness\"; theft does not necessarily stem from \"rare goods\"; the heart is not necessarily \"confused\" by \"seeing what is desirable.\" The ten thousand things lie in clumps, and delusive dreams arise—when my spirit and form cannot balance themselves, then wood grates against wood to generate heat, water clashes with water to produce bubbles. Yet if one governs them with this, their generation never ceases. Thus, the yang fire advances, and the position it has advanced to, now empty, summons yin. The yin tally retreats, and what it has retreated from drifts to encroach upon yang. Is there not always its opposite?\n\nThe \"empty\" returns to the \"heart,\" the \"full\" returns to the \"belly,\" the \"weak\" returns to the \"ambition,\" the \"strong\" returns to the \"bones\"—these four numbers each have their return and find their joyous land. Then, without my going, governance is achieved. Who is the master that causes their return? And who holds their mandate at what time?\n\nCan this reveal the nature of contention? Those who do not understand take no part in it. Thus, the sage inwardly uses it to purify the self and outwardly to govern the world.\n\nThe Dao is empty—*chong* (in ancient texts, *zhong*, the hollow within a vessel)—yet its use is never full. *It does not seek fullness, hence its \"or\"*—abyssal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts their sharpness, unravels their tangles; harmonizes their radiance, equalizes their dust. *Yang employs sharpness and embodies light; yin employs tangles and embodies dust.* Profound, it seems to endure. I know not whose child it is—it appears before the image of the Lord.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nAll use tends toward fullness, yet only *\"empty and used, it is never full\"*! Its operation as a principle emerges from \"tangles\" and \"dust,\" enters into \"sharpness\" and \"light\"; emerges from \"sharpness\" and \"light,\" enters into \"tangles\" and \"dust.\" Only the empty can be sharp, can be bright, can be tangled, can be dust—receiving the return of these four yet retaining none. Thus, when fierce qi comes to contend, a cold heart retreats to its place. Though there be a proud son, he cannot betray his ancestor; though there be a grand emperor, he cannot surpass his predecessor. Does it ever covet their sacrificial vessels or compete in their steps? It resembles and mirrors them, taking its name from things that cannot defy it.\n\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent—he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs. The space between heaven and earth—is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, *only when exhausted does benevolence arise* the more it moves, the more it issues forth. Having issued, it must reach its limit. Much speech hastens exhaustion—benevolence must speak, yet it is better to guard the center.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nWind arises from emptiness; the bellows awaits the drum—each requires the other to function, yet the vessel itself is not the use. Thus, sounds in unison need not respond, and qi in harmony need not seek. Therefore, heaven cannot give birth, earth cannot complete—heaven and earth cannot claim sole mastery, how much less the myriad things? How much less the sage? What is established in them is merely *\"empty yet inexhaustible.\"* The Dao seams through their midst, so that fish may be made to fly and birds to swim—benevolence is insufficient to resemble it. Benevolence is heaven’s qi, earth’s nourishment, the work of finite ends.\n\nThe valley spirit does not die—*Lu Jifu says: \"Form and formless unite and do not die\"*—this is called the mysterious female. *Lu Jifu says: \"The body unites with the heart, the heart with qi, qi with spirit, spirit with nothingness—united, it does not die; not dying, it does not arise; not arising, it can give rise to life\"*—the gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth. Ceaselessly it endures, its use never strained.\n\n**Chapter Six**\n\nThose who seek to extinguish the *\"valley spirit\"* in this world are without limit—ascending mountains to hunt it, gazing into abysses to angle for it, entering states to govern it, traversing wilds to cultivate it. Yet the valley spirit cannot be extinguished: it may be hunted, angled, governed, or cultivated, but it does not precede things to claim merit. The heaven and earth of former times perish in the present; the heaven and earth of today arise from the former. Flowing ceaselessly, they pass one to the other—life thus knows no end, and this is called the root. Grasping the root kills the root; following the root preserves the root. *\"Ceaselessly\"*—how it clings! *\"Never strained\"*—how it seems abandoned! Those who follow the root to employ its benefits open the *\"gate of the mysterious female\"*!\n\nHeaven endures, earth persists. That heaven and earth can endure and persist is because they do not live for themselves, do not give life to themselves—thus they attain long life. Things grow together with them, so the sage places himself last and finds himself first; sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is selfless? Therefore he fulfills his self. **Chapter Seven**\n\nWhen the fetus grows strong, the mother becomes weak; when the grain ripens, the stalk is harvested—few doubt that heaven and earth too grow weak and are harvested. Yet heaven and earth cannot but feed upon the myriad things, though they never feed for the sake of feeding. Each embryo has its origin, each root its bud; they roam within the void, yet ultimately draw sustenance from what is their own.\n\nThe sage does not expose himself to peril—thus he comes last; does not place himself at the center—thus he remains outside. He feeds upon the myriad things yet shows no favor; is fed upon by the myriad things, yet they bear no resentment. Thus, without exerting effort, his merit seeps into the barren soil; without awaiting the ear, his virtue spreads through the generations. And so he matches the enduring constancy of heaven and earth.\n\n**Highest virtue resembles water.**\nWater benefits the myriad things yet contends with none, dwelling where the multitude shun—*for men prefer the high and disdain the low*—thus it comes near the Dao.\nIt abides in good earth, its heart in deep stillness; it befriends with true kindness, speaks with trustworthiness, governs with good order, acts with skill, moves in timely accord. *Not clinging to its goodness, it is truly good.* Only by not contending does it remain free from blame.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\n\nThe five phases in their essence—water is the most subtle. Those who dwell well in the Dao value its subtlety, not its conspicuousness; they stay behind the multitude yet always precede them. Why? While others shun what is low, they arrive early without notice. Calculating in reverse, they gather slowly through non-contention—what loss is there for others to dispute? And what blame could fall upon them? If the multitude could recognize the goodness in what they despise, they too would rush to claim it. Yet human nature ensures this never comes to pass, so the sage monopolizes the advantage.\n\nHold and fill it—*hold it to make it full*—better to desist. Temper and sharpen it—*temper it to make it keen*—it cannot long endure. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them; *rightly, one guards them by not guarding.* Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall. To withdraw once merit is achieved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n\nIs not the valley alone adept at fullness? Is not water alone adept at keenness? Abiding in the vessel yet holding nothing—flowing with the current yet never forcing. Thus, as it fills, it empties; as it sharpens, it dulls. Were it otherwise, taking heaven as fulfillment, life would never cease; taking heaven as withdrawal, qi would never recede—how could this be trusted?\n\nThus, Fan Li’s disappearance as Tao Zhugong followed its trace; Guo Ziyi’s obscurity grasped its mechanism; Xu You and Zhi Fu’s departure embodied its spirit. The trace takes advance as advance, retreat as retreat. The mechanism, even as it advances, retreats; even as it retreats, advances. Is this not the spirit?—achieving without achievement, fulfilling without fulfillment.\n\nYet even in its retreating trace, the spirit does not forget the Dao, nor does its encounter descend into mechanism.\n\nCarry the po—*the po is the hun; to carry is for the po to bear*—and embrace the One—*the Three and Five as One*—can you remain undivided? Concentrate qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant? Purify the mysterious mirror—can you be without blemish? Loving the state and governing the people—can you act without action? The Gate of Heaven opens and closes—*the source from which life emerges is the Gate of Heaven*—can you remain feminine?—*only when transformation is complete does it receive.* Illuminating the four directions—can you be without knowledge?\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n*To carry is to be two with what is carried, thus divided. To concentrate and attain is no longer to be an infant. To purify and remove is already to have blemish. To love and govern is to act. To close and open is to lose half of the feminine. Illumination within, extension to the four directions—this is knowledge. This is the Dao of no constancy, yet leaning upon it for its name, both sides remain without suspicion—this is the perfection of wondrous virtue.*\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n\nThirty spokes converge upon a single hub—where its emptiness lies, *the hollow at the hub’s core*, there is the use of the cart. Clay is shaped to form a vessel—where its emptiness lies, *the hollow at the vessel’s center*, there is the use of the vessel. Doors and windows are cut to make a chamber—where its emptiness lies, *the hollow of the door and window openings*, there is the use of the chamber. Thus, what is present is taken for its benefit, while what is absent is taken for its use.\n\n*Wu Youqing says: Qi sustains the body, yet things give rise to qi.*\n\nWhat is created seeks to possess. Who knows that in seeking to possess, one preserves the void? Striving for presence, yet serving only absence—is this delight in emptiness? No, the void is where use is stored. Things stand before me, yet I cannot grasp them. Forms and numbers stand before the Dao, yet the Dao does not reside in them to obstruct itself.\n\nYin congeals and yang melts to form humanity, while the primal qi abides between them—encountered by those who rely neither on fire nor on talismans. Benevolence and righteousness, firmness and softness, become teachings, while the great uncarved block abides between them—encountered by those who rely neither on nature nor on emotion. Victory and defeat, gain and loss, become transformations, while the convergence of events abides between them—encountered by those who rely neither on order nor on chaos.\n\nThus, avoid what is hard, strike at its flaws, discard its name, and seek its reality. Wait but a moment, and the ten thousand mechanisms unite in one.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes;\n\nFive tones deafen the ears;\nFive flavors dull the palate;\nRacing and hunting madden the heart;\nRare goods corrupt conduct.\nThus the sage attends to the belly, not to the eyes—hence discarding that and embracing this.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe eye takes mechanism as its mechanism,\nwhile the belly takes non-mechanism as its mechanism.\nMechanism responds to mechanism,\nbut non-mechanism is what mechanism seeks to contain.\nBetween eye and belly lies the heart.\nOnly by withdrawing the heart to the belly can one observe things.\nThus turbidity must not be given a mind,\nnor clarity be given traces.\nDo not use ritual to curb desire,\nnor knowledge to discern intent—\nawait things’ self-collapse, and Heaven will be effortlessly released.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm;\nvalue great trouble as you do your own body.\nWhat does “favor and disgrace are like alarm” mean?\nFavor is inferior—\ndisgrace arrives and one is alarmed, but when it departs, one is at ease.\nYet favor arrives and one is alarmed, and when it departs, one is alarmed again—\nthus it is even worse.\nTo gain it is alarming, to lose it is alarming—\nthis is called “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”\nWhat does “value great trouble as you do your own body” mean?\nThe reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.\nIf I had no body, what trouble would I have?\nThus one who values the body as the world may be entrusted with the world;\none who cherishes the body as the world may be charged with the world.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen (continued)**\nThe multitude internalize the world within the body,\nwhile the perfected person externalizes the body to the world.\nFor one who does not internalize the world—\ncan there be inevitable worries?\nFavor arrives like alarm, disgrace comes like alarm—\nthis is internalizing the world by internalizing alarm to disturb oneself.\nGreat trouble lies in the world,\nyet to internalize and value it as equal to the body—\nwhen the body itself is trouble,\nto value trouble as a heavy burden upon the body\nis to internalize trouble to shackle oneself.\nOnly one without a body:\nlets the ear be the ear, not bearing the world’s hearing;\nlets the eye be the eye, not bearing the world’s seeing.\nMy ears and eyes are still,\nand the world’s seeing and hearing do not dazzle.\nAlarm and trouble depart from oneself\nand dissolve into the world—\nthus one treads upon the people’s path without stumbling.\n\nLook and it cannot be seen—call it the Subtle;\nlisten and it cannot be heard—call it the Rare;\ngrasp and it cannot be held—call it the Minute.\nThese three cannot be exhaustively questioned—\nthus they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not obscure.\nUnceasing, yet unnameable—\nit alternates between being and non-being, with no beginning or end.\nTo name it as being is to lose non-being;\nto name it as non-being is to lose being.\nEndlessly continuous, it cannot be named—\nit returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nthe imageless image—\nthis is called the Indistinct and Vague.\nMeet it and you do not see its head;\nfollow it and you do not see its rear.\nHold to the ancient Dao to steer the present being.\nThe ancient is also the beginning,\nthe present is also being.\nEmpty the\n\nThose who do not perceive its intervals\nattempt to unite or oppose it—\nthus all things become afflictions.\nThe Dao has no intervals,\nyet people forcibly divide them;\nthus they grasp and distinguish it—\nand the Dao becomes mere name.\nRiding the interval-less upon the intervalled,\none roams all day,\nand affliction and name depart.\nWhen affliction and name depart,\nthis is \"nothingness.\"\nAs for things that exist:\nsome are light, some heavy;\nsome radiant, some dust-like;\nsome act, some rest—\nthis is called \"lack of principle.\"\nOne name is yin, another yang—\nyet the harmonizing qi perishes.\nOne name is benevolence, another righteousness—\nyet the Great Harmony perishes.\nThe Dao is born before yin and yang,\nyet dies in benevolence and righteousness!\nThus,\nLi Zhu could not discern the meeting of black and white,\nShi Kuang could not fathom the convergence of gong and shang,\nQing Ji could not seize the gap in empty dust,\nand the divine Yu could not clarify the division of heaven and earth.\nWho but one of utmost constancy could partake in this?\n\nThe ancients who were skilled in the Dao\nwere subtly mysterious and profoundly penetrating,\ntoo deep to be known.\nPrecisely because they could not be known,\none can only forcibly describe them:\nhesitant, as if fording a river in winter;\ncautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\ndispersing, as if ice melting;\nthick, as if uncarved wood;\nvast, as if a valley;\nturbid, as if muddy;\nplacid, as if the sea;\ndriftless, as if without end.\nWho can gradually clarify the turbid through stillness?\nWho can gradually quicken the tranquil through movement?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nOnly by not being full\ncan one remain concealed and not newly completed.\n\nThose who choose the wondrous are many,\nyet few trace subtlety to its source.\nThose who seek penetration are numerous,\nyet rare are those who take mystery as penetration.\nJust as ceremonial caps are unsuited to Yue,\nif I have no intention of entering Yue,\nthen wonder lies not in whether one wears a cap or not—\nhow dare I test it on my body?\nHow dare I test its absence on my head?\nHow could I know that those who dare not test it\ndo not find Yue suited to me?\nSitting and dissolving it,\nice may be warmed,\nthe turbid may be clarified—\none may walk in rain without an umbrella,\ngo hungry without provisions.\nIn gradual waiting,\nis there truly a Yellow River that cannot be stilled,\na horse’s horn that cannot grow?\nThe world is already thus,\nyet those who vie for fame take blunted sharpness as achievement.\nLong have they abandoned the old and delighted in the new,\nyet cannot bring anything to completion!\n\nTo reach utmost emptiness,\n[The *Kaiyuan Commentary* states: \"To reach\" means to ensure it comes of itself, as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*' \"to summon the army.\"]\nguard stillness with sincerity.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I thereby observe their return.\nThings flourish in abundance,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness,\n[not that I still it—]\nstillness is called regaining life’s mandate.\nRegaining life’s mandate is called constancy,\n[which cannot again be altered.]\nTo know constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\nKnowing constancy, one embraces all,\n[the myriad changes may be contained.]\nEmbracing all, one is impartial,\n[not hoarding goodness for oneself.]\nImpartiality is wholeness,\n[receiving all things that come.]\nWholeness is Heaven,\nHeaven is the Dao,\nthe Dao is enduring—\nthroughout life, one encounters no peril.\n\nChapter Sixteen\n[The lowest strike at the solid,\nthe next seek the hollow.\nThe lowest seize movement,\nthe next cling to stillness.\nBetween two solids,\nemptiness thus arises naturally;\nat the extremity of all movement,\nstillness originally returns of itself.\nNeither seeking nor clinging,\none attains the utmost, the sincere.\nHow to clarify this?\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nand in their flourishing,\ntheir momentum exhausted, they return to whence they came.\nThus, the leaves of Deng Forest\nmay be counted without tally;\nthe rain of a thousand *li*\nmay be measured without vessel.\nYet abandoning this to act—\ncan it not be called reckless?\nTherefore, with nothing to possess or contrive,\nthe world is at my disposal—\nits Dao does not rely on action but on observation.\nObservation is the eye.\nTo observe without acting,\nthe eye becomes the belly.]\n\nThe highest,\nunaware of their existence;\n\nThe next rank,\ncherishes and praises them;\nthe next,\nfears them;\nthe next,\nscorns them.\nWhere trust is insufficient,\nthere is distrust.\nHow measured, how precious his words!\n\n[When one lacks self-trust,\none cannot trust the natural order of the world.\nAnd not knowing restraint yet still speaking,\nthis invites scorn.]\n\nWhen merit is achieved and affairs completed,\nthe hundred clans all say, \"We are naturally thus.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\n[Relying on the Dao in this,\none doubts that as the Dao;\nrelying on the Dao in that,\none doubts this is not the Dao.\nHaving first differentiated,\nthen sought commonality,\nthe Dao is confounded in duality,\nand afflicted in unity.\nBoth confounded and afflicted,\ndoubt does not depart.\nHaving already taken doubt as one’s own,\nthus the true king, seeing no intimacy, grieves;\nthe hegemon, encountering no fear, trembles.\nWith doubt unresolved,\nhe resorts to binding words—\nthus beginning with oaths and covenants,\nand ending in armor and helmets.\n\nYet he who makes others forget him in spontaneity—\ncould his heart not be spontaneous?\nTrusting that the world cannot transgress this,\nhe allows its flow to shift without departing from its source,\nwithout erring in its return.\nEmpty and unburdened above the world,\nhe awaits the self-completion of things.\n\nThus, the world’s nature\ncannot be forced, cannot be altered.\nThe governance of the highest,\nneither obstructs nor facilitates,\nlike an elder’s guidance,\nlike exhausting another’s strength—\nand people, idle and at ease, call it spontaneity.]\n\nWhen the great Dao declines,\nthere is benevolence and righteousness.\n\nWhen wisdom emerges, great deceit arises;\nwhen the six relations fall out of harmony, filial piety and kindness appear;\nwhen the state is benighted and disordered, loyal ministers emerge.\n\nSever sagacity, discard wisdom—\nthe people benefit a hundredfold;\nsever benevolence, discard righteousness—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness;\nsever skill, discard profit—\nthieves and bandits vanish.\nYet these three, made into ornament, are not sufficient.\n\nThus let there be that to which one belongs:\nmanifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce thought, diminish desire,\ncut off learning, and be without care.\n\n\"Unceasing, as if existing\"—\ncould this be that to which one belongs?\n\nThus the fish swims and water bears it; the bird flies and emptiness upholds it.\nOf all that contains the world’s ornament, none is greater than plainness;\nof all that supplies the world’s insufficiency, none is greater than simplicity.\nTo regard it as existent is yet far from intimate with its use;\nto regard it as nonexistent is where human and Heaven’s mutual intimacy lies.\nLinked to harmony to bring forth life—\nthus one attains long life.\nSevered from harmony to employ it exclusively—\nthus it has no great use.\n\n\"Yea\" and \"ah,\" how far apart are they?\nBeauty and ugliness, how distant are they?\nWhat men fear cannot but be feared.\nVast and boundless—how it has not yet reached its end!\n\nThe multitude bustle and rejoice,\nas if feasting on the grand sacrifice,\nas if ascending the terrace in spring.\nI alone remain still,\nwithout sign or omen,\ndim and murky, like an infant yet to smile,\nweary and forlorn, as if with no place to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem to have lost everything.\nWhat a fool’s heart I possess!\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nwhile I alone am dull and obscure.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nwhile I alone am muddled and confused.\nThe multitude all have their uses,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nand value feeding from the Mother.\n\nVirtue’s power takes form only by following the Dao.\nAs a thing, the Dao is only vague and indistinct.\nIndistinct and vague,\nyet within it are images;\nvague and indistinct,\nyet within it are things.\nDark and obscure,\nyet within it is essence;\nits essence is most real,\nwithin it is trustworthiness.\nFrom present back to ancient times,\nits name has never departed,\nby which we observe the origins of the multitude.\nHow do I know the forms of the multitude’s origins?\nBy this.\n\nThe two pair and give rise to the \"Mean.\"\n\"Vague and indistinct\" have no pair,\nwithout pair there is no \"Mean.\"\nHow then can one know that between the paired,\nit is neither left nor right,\nand thus cannot be called the \"Mean\"?\nThe \"Mean\" enters into pairing yet embraces the paired.\nThough there be hardened metal,\nit may be forged and melted;\nthough there be piled earth,\nit may be washed away and leveled.\nThus metal and earth cannot preserve their nature.\nThough there be hot springs,\nthere are also cold fires;\nthus water and fire cannot maintain their true essence.\nWhat is it that is harder than metal without sharpening,\ndenser than earth without thickness,\nhotter than fire without warmth,\ncolder than water without moisture?\nIt observes change yet does not shift,\nknows what is so yet does not proceed.\nThus nothing is more real than the insubstantial,\nnothing more trustworthy than the unreturning,\nno name more enduring than that which does not alter between this and that,\nand no form more perfect than that which does not differ from the myriad in even one part.\nSeizing Heaven’s mechanism,\ndiscarding semblances of the Dao—\nonly then may it be named \"Vast Virtue.\"\n\nTo bend is to be whole,\nto twist is to be straight,\nto hollow is to be filled,\nto wear out is to be renewed,\nto have little is to gain,\nto have much is to be confused.\nThus the sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven.\nNot seeing oneself, one is thus illuminated;\nnot asserting oneself, one is thus distinguished.\n\nNot self-boasting, thus possessing merit;\nnot self-aggrandizing, thus enduring.\nOnly through non-contention\ndoes none under Heaven contend with it.\nThe ancient saying \"To bend is to be whole\"—\nhow could it be empty words?\nTruly whole, it returns to wholeness.\n\nChapter Twenty-Two\n\nThe teachings of things involve coming and going.\nTo meet what comes is not as good as to await what goes;\nto chase what goes is not as good as to await what comes.\nYet those who daily scrutinize coming and going with the mind\nare neither ahead of the time nor in time with it.\nPreceding, they lose what follows;\nfollowing, they lose what precedes—\ntoiling endlessly yet gaining nothing.\nThus lesser wisdom daily sees its excess,\nwhile greater wisdom daily sees its insufficiency.\nThe great Dao abides in the center,\nlike one who, searching for a lost child or misplaced family treasure,\nrushes about in confusion with armored steed,\nyet finds nothing all day—\nhow long has multiplicity been a delusion?\n\nOne is called \"emptiness,\" emptiness is called \"constancy.\"\nAbiding in constancy, employing emptiness,\nnurturing the bent to become whole,\none comprehends the great pattern of coming and going.\n\nFew words accord with nature.\n\nThus the whirlwind does not last the morning,\nnor the sudden rain the whole day.\nWhat brings these about? Heaven and Earth.\nIf even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,\nhow much less can man?\n\nTherefore those who engage with the Dao become one with the Dao;\nthose who engage with virtue become one with virtue;\nthose who engage with loss become one with loss.\nThose who become one with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them;\nthose who become one with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them;\nthose who become one with loss—loss delights in obtaining them.\nWhere trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\n\nOnly those who truly know the Dao see all as naturally trustworthy.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth violate their harmony,\nthey may act as heaven, act as earth,\nyet cannot endure.\nWhen man violates his harmony,\nhe may gain, he may lose,\nyet cannot unite.\nFlowing with yang, he is stifled by yin;\nflowing with yin, he is stifled by yang.\nWords in excess stumble; joy at its peak turns to sorrow.\nThe mind shifts a hundred times, startling even in sleep.\nNot knowing the vastness of unity, he disbelieves much,\nsitting and losing the constant Dao—\nhow can he hope for spontaneity?\n\nAll Dao is Dao, all virtue is virtue, all loss is loss.\nDao and virtue delight in roaming with the like—\nhow could they change even after long ages?\nWithout reaching extremes of joy or anger,\nwhat fault lies in wind or rain?\n\nThose who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm;\nthose who stride do not walk far.\nThose who display themselves are not enlightened;\nthose who assert themselves are not distinguished;\nthose who boast of their deeds achieve no merit;\nthose who are proud do not endure.\n\nIn the Way, these are called:\nexcess like leftover food, growths like tumors.\nBeings may loathe them—\nthus those who possess the Way do not dwell in them.\n\n---\n\nThose whose minds grow ever more frantic lose ever more of the trigger;\nthose who cling ever more rigidly err ever more grievously.\nWhen the prior trigger has passed,\nto chase and attach to it\nis like eating one’s fill and then setting out more.\nWhen the later trigger has not yet come,\nto force and bind to it\nis like a body already formed and then adding extra limbs.\nThe calculations of the Way are inexhaustible—\nto grasp partiality or excess in order to exhaust them\nis surely to incur the hatred of beings\nand to harm oneself.\n\n---\n\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nSilent, empty,\nit stands alone and does not change,\nit moves in cycles and does not weary—\nit may be called the Mother of heaven and earth.\n\nI do not know its name—\nforced to designate it, I call it *Dao*;\nforced to name it, I call it *Great*.\nGreat means passing,\npassing means far-reaching,\nfar-reaching means returning.\n\nThus the Dao is great,\nheaven is great,\nearth is great,\nand man is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four greats,\nand man occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nearth models itself on heaven,\nheaven models itself on the Dao,\nand the Dao models itself on spontaneity.\n\n---\n\nForms and images have gaps;\nthe Dao has no gaps.\nThe Dao does not choose being,\nnor does it choose non-being—\nit goes along with them all.\nGoing without ceasing in its going,\nthus it is called passing, far-reaching.\nAbiding without contradicting its coming,\ngoing along with them all in their coming,\nthen the passing and far-reaching immediately return.\nSince the Dao is already thus,\nthose who model themselves on the Dao\nalso ride along with it in its going and coming.\nAnd those who ride along with it in its going and coming,\nby maintaining constancy, the world naturally reverts—\nhow could they worry that their measures will be insufficient?\n\n“Bearing the *po* and embracing the One without parting”—\nthis is how it is used.\nTaken from near at hand, the body,\nit is like the stillness of the back, not the mechanism of the eyes.\nTaken from afar, heaven and earth,\nit is like great governance, not carving and dividing.\nThus it can serve as the king of the world.\n\nWeight is the root of lightness, stillness the ruler of restlessness.\nThus the noble person travels all day without parting from their heavy provisions.\nThough there be splendid sights, they dwell in leisurely detachment.\nHow could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his own person as light before the world?\nLightness loses its root, restlessness loses its ruler.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\n\nWhere there is root, there is stem; where there is ruler, there is minister.\nYet is it not better to guard the root?\nIn a single breath’s span, the myriad movements contend,\nyet cannot but come to rest.\nThe Dao does not stagnate in what comes to rest,\nbut through what comes to rest, observation is made—\nthen the Dao’s roaming in emptiness,\nits ceaseless continuity, becomes visible.\nIf one cannot endure even for a moment,\nbut proceeds lightly,\nthen responses lie in one while contradictions lie in ten thousand;\ngrace resides in one corner while resentment fills the other three.\nThus the world is handed the handle,\nand one’s own person is instead controlled.\nHence the Xia perished through the construction of the Mulberry Palace,\nand the Zhou declined through the boats for Han conquest.\nTo rescue the world with benevolence is to drown it;\nto save the world with righteousness is to sink it.\nThe world’s vastness may be swept away in an instant—\nhow much more the harmony within one’s own body?\n\nGood conduct leaves no wheel tracks, good speech no flaws.\n\nGood conduct does not tread upon solid ground, good speech does not cling to beauty. Good calculation requires no counting rods; counting rods achieve the small but forget the great. Good closure needs no bolt nor bar yet cannot be opened—Lu Jifu says: \"If I do not open, who can open it?\" Good binding needs no cord nor knot yet cannot be undone—no attachment, no separation, like a mother to her child.\n\nThus the sage is ever good at saving people, and so discards no one; ever good at saving things, and so discards nothing. This is called inheriting clarity.\n\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good; the not-good person is the resource of the good. If one does not value one’s teacher nor cherish one’s resource, though wise, one is greatly deluded. This is called the essential mystery.\n\nChapter Twenty-Seven\nMy possession of clarity is not clarity—how much less to cast clarity upon things and measure their lengths and shorts to make them shine? Thus birds are trapped by fullness, earthworms confined by emptiness, fish stranded on dry land—each secures its capture yet does not know that what seems not to be gained can be gain. If I wish to overcome them, I do not go forth to measure them.\n\nAll things adorn their forms to seek one another, or flee their beauty to provoke one another; all secretly probe their roots, conceal and possess them—then things come to me, and I do not go to things. The many full seek supply, but the one empty has no gaps. Thus the intentions of good and evil vanish, and what speech and conduct enclose and bind is an essential mystery beyond fathoming.\n\nKnow the masculine, keep to the feminine—Lu Jifu says: \"Harmonious yet not leading\"—become the world’s stream. As the world’s stream, constant virtue does not depart, returning to infancy. Know the white, keep to the black, become the world’s model. As the world’s model, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless. Know glory, keep to disgrace, become the world’s valley. As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to uncarved simplicity.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; the sage employs it and becomes the chief of officials—using what has not yet scattered. Thus great wisdom does not sever.\n\nChapter Twenty-Eight\nWhether feminine or masculine, white or black, glory or disgrace, each has its counterpart and cannot intermingle. Then my Dao is nearly exhausted, and my knowing and keeping are no longer one. The knowing return to clarity, the keeping return to turbidity; the two arts divide, each returning to its likeness. One who roams the circle’s center may know this.\n\nYet if one devotes intent to knowing but achieves success through keeping, why is this? The guest is clarity, the host is turbidity—by the necessity of things reaching their extreme and turning back, what turns back can long be the host. Thus infancy can mature, but maturity cannot return to infancy; the boundless can become bounded, but the bounded cannot become boundless; simplicity can be carved, but carving cannot return to simplicity.\n\nYet the sage does not meticulously distinguish between what can and cannot be. Roaming the circle’s center, like a soaking rain upon an anthill, like a prairie fire scorching a thicket—without beginning or end, most solid and most empty—establishing order so that clarity and turbidity each return to their abodes, resplendently enacting great regulation.\n\nThough compelled to seek its use, then the feminine, the black, the disgraceful—grasp their power to age the world’s vessels.\n\nChapter Twenty-Nine\nThose who would take the world and act upon it, I see they do not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel—though it is a vessel, the sacred constantly flows through it—it cannot be acted upon, cannot be grasped. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\n\nThus the sage practices non-action, and so does not ruin; does not grasp, and so does not lose. For things sometimes lead, sometimes follow; sometimes exhale, sometimes inhale; sometimes are strong, sometimes weak; sometimes are upheld, sometimes overthrown. All is as the sacred makes it so.\n\nTherefore the sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes excessiveness.\n\nThe world is within me—what do I take? I am within the world—what do I do? The world is like me—what do I desire? I am like the world—what do I grasp? Measuring the world by myself, the world is sacred. Encountering myself with the world, the world is not sacred. Those who are not sacred make it sacred, and the world is disordered. Those who are sacred make it not sacred, and I am at peace.\n\nThus exhausting the world with the eight reckonings and removing my three deaths, then raging fire may burn the forest yet one can await its cold, vast floods may drown the heavens yet one can watch them dry. Water and fire lose their power, metal and stone forsake their steadfastness—how much more those with feelings who must be exhausted and those with qi who must contract?\n\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use arms to strengthen the world.\n\nThe matter favors remoteness. Where the army dwells, brambles grow. In the wake of great armies, lean years must follow. Goodness achieves its end and no more—it does not seize strength. Having achieved, do not boast; having achieved, do not vaunt; having achieved, do not grow arrogant. Achievement comes only when there is no other choice; having achieved, do not force it. Even in times when arms must be used, when calamity arises and victory is certain, one should still hold these five principles in mind.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called not following the Dao. What does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\n[Chapter 30]\nThose who employ arms at the lowest level do so to kill; at the highest, to preserve life. Yet even those who use life to sustain life are superfluous—how much more those who use killing to sustain life? People are never without life—why then should I urge them? Moreover, the gate of merit is the mansion of harm. People are never without life, yet one cannot rely on their living; things are never without death, yet one cannot depend on their dying. A moment’s failure of restraint, and one calls oneself resolute—is this not delusion?\n\nThus, those who are skilled at restraining violence wait for its dissipation rather than crushing its breath; those who are skilled at governing the passions block their growth rather than forcing their decline; those who value life hold to the balance between growth and decline, without trespassing against their critical juncture. Even in adversity, they do not perish early.\n\nThe weapon of war is an inauspicious instrument—some beings detest it, and thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell with it. The noble person at rest values the left, but in warfare values the right. War is an inauspicious instrument, not the instrument of the noble person; when compelled to use it, one should do so with utmost restraint. To triumph is not to be celebrated; those who celebrate it delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their will in the world.\n\nAuspicious affairs honor the left, while inauspicious affairs honor the right. The deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right—this is to treat war as a funeral rite. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with funeral rites.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nBetter to forget it beforehand than to lament it afterward; better to dwell in the realm of no merit through auspicious means than to claim merit through inauspicious rites. Those who cannot seize the initiative, cannot choose the auspicious, cannot exploit opportunities with abundance—such are they of whom it is said, *\"How could they comprehend the meaning of ritual?\"*\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless—*Wang Fusi says: \"The Dao is formless and unbound, eternally beyond naming\"*—though its uncarved simplicity is small, none in the world can subjugate it. If lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will naturally submit. Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew, and the people, without command, distribute it evenly.\n\nOnce systems create names, and names are established, one must also know when to stop; knowing when to stop ensures one does not fall into peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams in relation to rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nValleys and streams form rivers and seas, but rivers and seas cannot revert to valleys and streams. The Dao disperses to become the world, but the world cannot revert to the Dao.\n\nThose who rely on the Great Beginning remain nameless; those who halt at what is already so acquire names. Yet if, having acquired names, one can still halt, then the former name is fulfilled while the latter name does not arise. Beyond this, one may yet return to the Great Beginning. Heaven and earth are substantial; sweet dew is subtle. Rising from the earth, the earth claims no merit; descending from heaven, heaven does not perpetually possess it. This is the natural course after halting—without command, it distributes itself evenly. The subtlety of post-heaven aligns with pre-heaven; how much more so for that which has never begun to halt?\n\nTo know others is wisdom; to know oneself is clarity.\n\nThe one who overcomes others is mighty; the one who overcomes oneself is strong. The one who knows contentment is rich. The one who acts with perseverance has resolve. The one who does not lose their place endures. The one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\n\n[Wealth does not necessarily entail resolve, and resolve cannot be equated with wealth. Endurance has its limits, but longevity knows no end.]\n\nTo use qi to supplement qi, essence to supplement essence, and claim \"I do not lose my place\"—yet in the end, all return to decay. How is this different from Shan Bao, who perished externally, or Zhang Yi, who perished internally? For those who scheme with cunning and exert force to pursue their ambitions, clinging to a \"place\" yet unable to follow the natural \"place\" of no loss—such is their fate. To see that one’s essence and qi are not in excess may be called death, yet that which remains within—gentle as a maiden, flowing like clouds, subtle and mysteriously penetrating—has never perished. Without truly employing this subtle clarity, bending and stretching within the ultimate harmony of the Dao, as if embracing it without parting, how could one partake in this?\n\nThus, the laws of Youyu endured, but the Way of Tai Shi was long-lived. The calculations of mediocre scholars may stretch long, but the life of those who embody the Dao knows no bounds. These words record the achievements of the Profound Mystery.\n\nThe Great Dao flows everywhere, to left and right alike. The myriad things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse; its work is accomplished, yet it does not claim possession. It clothes and nourishes the myriad things yet does not act as their master—it may be called small. The myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—it may be called great. Because it never asserts its own greatness, [it may be named yet does not act—this is why it never acts as such] it accomplishes its greatness.\n\nWho can claim to repay heaven and earth with life, only to resent them in death? Heaven and earth engage with things in constant exchange, merely prolonging their own existence. If even heaven and earth are thus, how much more so the Dao? Vast and boundless, without borders; flowing and interconnected, with means to communicate. Thus, east and west have no fixed direction, achievements and fame bear no attachment, host and guest have no fixed roles, one’s own life is valued yet the lives of things are not opposed. Truly, if one does not perceive what is desirable, it is not because desire is blocked; if one alternates in the role of master, it is not because one refuses mastery. How could those who hastily seek to establish their greatness ever comprehend this?\n\nHold to the Great Image, and all under heaven will come to you.\n\nThose who come to you do no harm—though they forget one another in the arts of the Dao, they never truly part—thus attaining peace and great tranquility.\n\nMusic and delicacies entice the passing traveler to stay.\nThe Dao that issues from the mouth is so bland it seems flavorless,\nseen yet not worthy of sight,\nheard yet not worthy of hearing,\nyet its use cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe thirty-fifth chapter:\nThe snake’s control lies in its neck; man’s control lies in his waist.\nBind its neck, and its sting is rendered useless;\n\"restrain the waist,\" and \"the spine unfolds.\"\nThe image is subtle, yet its control is vast.\n\nThus, the clear and empty are the convergence of things,\nwhile the heavy and turbid are their regulators.\nDo not abandon the regulator, nor flee the convergence;\nfrom emptiness gain fullness, from fullness gain emptiness.\nGrasp the heavy and turbid to attain the clear and empty.\n\nTry reflecting on this: when music plays and delicacies are prepared,\neven the traveler hastening on his way finds his wandering heart stilled—\nis this not a return to feeling?\nThis is what is meant by \"constantly having desire to observe its manifestations.\"\n\nYet the neck and the waist are without feeling.\nWhat is without feeling cannot be forced to accept what has feeling as its master.\nThus, in its profound subtlety and boundless use,\nthis is the ultimate of desirelessness.\n\nBeginning with the heavy and turbid, returning to the clear and empty;\nhaving attained the clear and empty, following the heavy and turbid;\nwhether with desire or without, the constant remains unchanged—\nthis is what those who hold to the Great Image alone attain!\n\nWhen you wish to contract it, you must first expand it;\nwhen you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it;\nwhen you wish to abolish it, you must first promote it;\nwhen you wish to seize it, you must first give it.\n(What is firm is inwardly and outwardly steadfast, unchanged from beginning to end.)\nThis is called \"subtle clarity.\"\n(As Wang Yuanzhe said: \"Even ghosts and spirits in their hidden depths cannot fathom it—how much less can men?\")\n\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nFish must not leave the depths;\nthe state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.\n\nLi Xizhai said: This is the way of the sage in mastering the heart and seizing the passions—Chapter Thirty-Six.\n(To contain the Dao is to find one’s own ease;\nto embrace the Dao is to preserve one’s own existence—\nis this not like fish finding their own fulfillment in the depths?\nThose who rely on names and reputations fear only that they will not be shown to others,\nand so the Dao stagnates, and the world probes its limits.\nWithout gates, without poisons, all things look to me for this alone.\nIf I do not respond to them with this, then the world will have no way to reach me.\nHaving no way to reach me, where in the world can it go?\nThus the world dies to the Dao and encounters eternal life in the world—\nthis is the use of this instrument.)\n\nThe Dao is constantly without action, yet there is nothing it does not do.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will transform themselves.\nWhen transformation stirs desire, I will suppress it with the nameless uncarved block.\nSuppressing it with the nameless uncarved block, desire will cease.\nWith desire stilled, the world will right itself.\n(What transforms returns to the manifest;\nwhat is right returns to the wondrous.)\n\nChapter Thirty-Seven:\n(Those who conceal the uncarved block have the use of instruments for all time;\nthose who display the uncarved block find their use limited to instruments alone.\nThus the nameless and the named are companions, yet they cannot be without it.\nFearing its use and making the named its companion, they therefore cast aside desire.\nThose who defend the state by fortifying the city do not seek the merit of repelling invaders;\nthose who guard the self by closing the gate do not resist the allure of external things.\nKnowing the root of things to be right, they dare not set them right through transformation.\nIn their practice of the Dao, when measured by the profound mystery, it seems shallow;\nwhen opened through the wondrous gate, it seems deep.\nDeeming it useless, its use is manifest;\ndeeming it useful, its uselessness is manifest.\nAll day long it disperses yet is never empty;\nin the faintest breath it communicates, wriggling as if it exists.\nTwo ramparts stand, and it guards well the space between;\ntwo extremes race, and it awaits well their return—\nthen what need is there to speak of the uncarved block, and how can the profound exhaust it?)\n\nHighest virtue does not act as virtue, and so possesses virtue;\nlesser virtue does not lose virtue, and so lacks virtue.\nHighest virtue acts without acting and without purpose;\nlesser virtue acts with purpose.\n(Acting in non-being is called acting without purpose;\nacting in being is called acting with purpose.)\nHighest benevolence acts without purpose;\nhighest righteousness acts with purpose.\nHighest propriety acts, and when none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and forces them.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows.\nPropriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of disorder.\nForeknowledge—\n(its clarity is not within, but arises from grasping prior conditions—\nthis is called foreknowledge)\n—is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly.\nTherefore the great man dwells in the substantial, not in the superficial;\n(what is sharp and swiftly gains fame is superficial;\nwhat retreats and nurtures the root is substantial.)\nhe dwells in the real, not in the flowery.\nThus he discards that and takes this.\n\nChapter Thirty-Eight.\n\nThe conduct of tigers and leopards—\nadvancing forward, they cannot look back.\nNewly planted trees—\nwhen their blossoms flourish, their roots cannot take firm hold.\nYet one cannot remain without advancing;\nif there must be advance, let it be with simplicity at the fore!\nThose who advance confront danger;\nthose who retreat observe change.\nThose who confront danger are steadfast and unshaken;\nthose who observe change adapt to circumstances with measured discernment.\nThus, one does not wield the sharpness of knowledge to assail the world’s perilous clefts.\nWhy?\nBecause to lose the master is to delight in seizing fine reputations and clinging to them,\nturning away from the encompassing beauty of the multitude—\nthese are virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety,\nwhich can be named but do not endure.\nThus, to go forth is to exceed in floridity,\nto return is to exceed in superficiality.\nOnly by first restraining those who advance\ncan one attain virtue without claiming virtue,\nand act without contrivance.\n\nYan Junping said:\n*\"The utmost arrives, yet oneness does not remain.\"*\nDoes it not remain?\nTruly, there is no means by which to retain it.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nspirits attained the One and became numinous;\nvalleys attained the One and became full;\n*(valleys are empty yet receive the myriad things, hence they are called \"full\")*\nthe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nkings and lords attained the One and became the norm for all under heaven.\nIn their attainment, it is said:\nWere heaven not clear, it would fear rending;\nwere earth not tranquil, it would fear crumbling;\nwere spirits not numinous, they would fear fading;\nwere valleys not full, they would fear exhaustion;\nwere the myriad things not alive, they would fear annihilation;\nwere kings and lords not the norm, they would fear downfall.\nThus, the noble takes the humble as its root,\nthe high takes the low as its foundation.\nTherefore, kings and lords refer to themselves as \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" \"the unworthy.\"\nIs this not taking the humble as their root?\nIs it not so?\nThus, to amass many carriages is to have no carriage.\nTherefore, one does not desire to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.\n\nLi Xizhai said:\n*\"Wheels, canopies, spokes, and axles—\nassembled, they become a carriage,\nyet each part has its name, while the carriage itself cannot be named.\nBenevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—\nunited, they form the Dao,\nyet benevolence and righteousness can be named, while the Dao cannot.\nIf there is something to grasp, allowing its traces to appear externally,\nthe noble becomes like jade, the base like stone—\nonce they can be pointed out and named, people begin to distinguish noble from base.\"*\n\nThe foolish cling to the \"One\" yet cannot \"employ\" it;\nthe wise daily \"employ\" it yet cannot \"unite\" with it.\nTo \"employ\" is to lose the \"One\";\nnot to \"unite\" is to lack \"employment.\"\nThe \"One\" embraces the myriad things,\nentering them without opposing them.\n\"Employment\" is without affairs,\nengaging with affairs without clinging to them.\nHow much less can it be sought or grasped?\nThus, when wine ferments, buyers arrive;\nwhen a lodging is repaired, travelers rest.\nI do not \"attain the One\" but provisionally guard its turbidity,\nusing it as a bellows and basket,\nand only then can the \"One\" be \"attained\" without refusal.\nFor the noble and base, high and low, are equal in relation to the \"One\"—\nhow can there be a fitting match?\nYet the noble and high are the storehouses of merit and fame,\nwhile the base and low have no accomplishment.\nMerit is established without mutual inclusion,\nfame is fixed without mutual communication—\nthen even the myriad things are not exhausted,\nhow much less the \"One\"?\nThus, the principle of heaven and earth is impaired,\nand the way of kings and lords is lost.\nThose who use the great \"carriage\" to bear all under heaven\nhave long known what to take and what to discard.\n\nReversion is the movement of the Dao.\n\nMovement both departing and arriving—this is called reversion. The qi-mechanism of transformation in things, all possessing departure and arrival, originates in the Dao’s flowing vastness, its ceaseless shifting, exhalation and inhalation, its subtlety in non-stasis.\n\nWeakness is the function of the Dao. Firmness and strength rely on support and thus lose their function—this is not the Dao. The function of the Dao lies solely in movement through weakness.\n\nThe ten thousand things under heaven are born from Being, and Being is born from Non-being. When the Dao rests in Non-being, is this not reversion? That which ascends—is it not movement? As Zhao Zhijian says: Though things have not yet taken form, their qi already exists. Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things arise from the One Qi, and the One Qi arises from the Dao.\n\nChapter Forty:\nFlowing, it may fill; full, it may halt—then it dies and becomes a vessel. People know the vessel’s utility but do not know it died in becoming a vessel. As for the Dao, it embraces the ten thousand things and enters the ten thousand things, now departing, now arriving, now arriving, now departing, coiling and subtle, never exhausted. When it presses forward and arrives, there is Being; when it draws back and departs, it entrusts itself to Non-being to generate Being, and thus may be named Non-being. Therefore, observing it through its reversion, one may perceive it directly.\n\nIts child is light, its grandchild is water—truly, to embody its function is difficult. To force arrival with strength, to halt departure with weakness, to bring forth function through movement, is to cling to robust existence and obstruct the qi-mechanism of life’s departure and arrival. Thus, function always lies in weakness, and only then can the Dao be employed.\n\nThe arising of movement is the work of Heaven. The arising of function is the work of humans. Heaven models itself on the Dao, humans model themselves on Heaven—what place is there for force? Yet those who know the fundamental movement of the Dao’s body are few. Only by knowing movement does one know reversion; by knowing reversion does one know weakness.\n\nThe highest scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it. The middling scholar, hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt. The lowest scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs loudly at it. Without such laughter, it would not suffice as the Dao. Thus, established sayings declare:\n\nThe luminous Dao seems obscure;\nThe advancing Dao seems to retreat;\nThe level Dao seems uneven;\nHighest virtue resembles a valley;\nVast virtue seems insufficient;\nEstablished virtue seems lax;\nTrue substance seems to change;\nGreat purity seems sullied;\nGreat squares have no corners;\nGreat vessels take long to complete;\nGreat sounds are scarcely heard;\nGreat images have no form.\n\nAs Lü Jifu says: Sinking into petty measures, one returns to great penetration.\n\nThe Dao conceals itself in namelessness.\n[The constant name cannot be named.]\n\nOnly the Dao excels at bestowing and accomplishing.\nAs in Chapter Forty-One:\n\nIf there were one skilled in bestowing, others would seek to borrow from him, yet he does not cling to things to grant them. The Dao, too, is thus—yet I have never seen things borrow from the Dao. Why? Things and the Dao form a single body, and things are the Dao itself. Things come and go, live and return, daily drinking from the Dao, yet ultimately never moistened; daily illuminated by the Dao, yet ultimately returning to where there is no light. Without moisture, without illumination—this is the minor accomplishment of things. Without brilliance, without flow—the Dao’s function reaches its utmost. Thus, one may strive yet never apply force; one may act yet never see achievement. The names of \"obscurity,\" \"retreating,\" \"disgrace,\" and \"laxity\" are not falsely ascribed. Yet those who accept them without refusal—can they not be called the highest scholars?\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One, [the unifying qi harmonizes]. The One gives birth to the Two, [once harmony is achieved, yin and yang emerge. The unifying qi and yin-yang become two]. The Two gives birth to the Three, [yin and yang again divide to become three]. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the unifying qi.\n\nWhat people despise are \"orphan,\" \"widow,\" and \"worthless,\" yet kings and lords take these as their titles. Thus, some things are diminished yet gain, while others are increased yet lose. What others teach, I also teach. [The supreme Dao is not in words; it is known through resonance.] \"The strong and violent do not meet a natural death\"—I take this as the father of all teachings.\n\nForty-Second Chapter\n[When it abides in the Dao, containing \"Three\" within the \"One,\" the fullness of life cannot be fathomed, and its ultimate state is minimal. When it acts as life, it begins with the \"unifying qi\" and ends with \"yin and yang.\" Once yin and yang are established, the affairs of life multiply, and the principle of life is exhausted. How much more so when, following the inclinations of yin and yang, one pursues purity to greedily grasp heaven and clings to turbidity to stubbornly hold earth, inhaling at dawn and dining at dusk, endlessly filling and pouring to flaunt abundance, while despising all else as insufficient? Then yin dies in turbidity, yang dies in purity—how can one even faintly resemble the so-called \"harmony\"? How much less attain the harmony that transcends harmony?\n\nReflecting on this, one then understands that ceaselessly preserving the minimal, diminishing the minimal to achieve \"harmony,\" and diminishing \"harmony\" to attain the \"One.\" Yet those who attain the \"One\" possess no \"One,\" and those who achieve \"harmony\" make no achievement. Dispersing their factions, wandering their courts, yin and yang reside within me yet do not betray their origin—then the greatest \"increase\" is achieved, what more could be added?]\n\nThe softest in the world gallops through the hardest. Non-being enters where there is no gap; thus I know the benefit of non-action. Teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain this.\n\nForty-Third Chapter\n[Those who rush north to reach Yan, those who race south to reach Yue—yet the chariot with no destination always finds level ground without obstruction, traversing all things without resistance. One who unties with an awl cannot undo an untangled knot; one who splits with an axe cannot cleave unsplit firewood. If one knows that the solid contains the hollow and thus follows it, then no matter how myriad the changes, my will is never thwarted. Those who flaunt their \"hardness\" and prepare defenses, or measure gaps to exploit fissures, are many—this is why the Dao ultimately withdraws into the \"nameable.\"]\n\nWhich is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Excessive love incurs great cost; hoarding leads to heavy loss. Thus, knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. [Xue Juncai says: Delighting in what one already has is enough—why seek further disgrace? Fearing future loss, one knows the peril of excess.] This is how one endures long.\n\nForty-Four Chapter\n[What is called the \"perfected person\" is not one who distances themselves from things to live in isolation, sitting idly to watch changes, knowing that in the end, I cannot control things, nor can things control me. Thus, disgrace has its origins, yet disgrace may come without cause; danger summons itself, yet danger may arrive uninvited. However, if one hastily seizes misfortune to accept a \"name,\" it would be better to remain without attachment. Therefore, one is said to skillfully cherish \"name\" and skillfully dwell in \"wealth,\" skillfully embrace \"gain\" and skillfully relinquish \"loss.\"\n\n\"Gain\" for the self quietly dissolves the disharmony of yin and yang; \"gain\" for the world disperses the ferocity of tigers and rhinos.]\n\nGreat accomplishment seems incomplete, yet its use is inexhaustible. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless. Great straightness seems bent, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems inarticulate. Cold overcomes restlessness; stillness overcomes heat. [Sheng reads as \"overcome.\" Ye Mengde says: Knowing what overcomes, what can one not achieve?] Purity and stillness govern the world. [When the world is governed, it governs itself. If one seeks to govern the world, one only increases its cold and heat.]\n\nForty-Fifth Chapter\n[When yin and yang interact, human affairs become complicated; when human affairs complicate, achievements and fame become prominent. Thus, those who delight in action are drawn to what is full and flock to it. Yet when one attaches to what is already full, it must diminish oneself, leading to the desire to overcome it. I see them shivering in the cold and rushing to the fire, or sweltering in heat and drinking ice—only to exhaust themselves. Do they enjoy such suffering? Initially, they followed what was easy to seek fullness, unaware it would come to this. But if one conserves early, remains unmoved by things, then yin and yang grow naturally, without attachment to achievements or fame. Beginning without dependence, ending without competition, the world is governed, yet I seem to have done nothing. Thus, in appearance, one seems lacking, yet in reality, enjoys abundance. Truly enjoying it, why worry about appearances?]\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields. When the world loses the Dao, warhorses breed in the suburbs. No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment; no fault is greater than the desire for gain. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is always sufficient.\n\nForty-Sixth Chapter\n[Disaster arises from the heart’s core, while fortune hides in namelessness. A single trigger’s movement is like an ant’s burrow, yet the clash of myriad killings is like a river’s breach. Therefore, those who follow the Dao do not seek fortune first, and the world knows no disaster. Is this due to forced restraint? Understanding the excesses and harms of yin and yang, delighting in wandering the garden of great harmony—how could one, with one’s limited knowledge, transgress what must harm others?]\n\n】Without stepping beyond the door, one knows the world;\n【Zhang An says: To step beyond the door is to depart from this and acquire knowledge】\nWithout gazing through the window, one sees the Heavenly Dao.\n【Zhang An says: To gaze through the window is to fix upon that and gain sight】\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus the sage knows without traveling, sees without looking, accomplishes without acting.\n\nForty-Seventh Chapter\n【The Dao fills the space between inclination and aversion.\nWhere there is inclination, there must be aversion.\nWithout inclination, without aversion—this may be called the center.\nYet people grope blindly all day in search of the center and fail to find it, becoming the world’s laughingstock.\nIf all else fails, one might try reversing course.\nReversal is not the center, yet gradually its boundaries appear.\nSuddenly, like light streaming through a crack;\nSubtly, like silk threading a loom.\nThings impart knowledge to me, yet I need not strive—\nOnly then do I realize that those who once chased lost children and pursued runaway horses were both toilsome and foolish.\nOtherwise, how could there be in the world those who \"know without traveling, see without looking, accomplish without acting\"?】\n\nIn learning, one daily accumulates;\nIn cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes.\nDiminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo govern the world, one must act without interference;\nWhen there is interference, it is no longer sufficient to govern the world.\n【The world cannot be governed by seizing—what the world offers to me is called \"seizing\" alone.】\n\nForty-Eighth Chapter\n【To diminish what is present is to augment what is absent.\nAbandon what is seized, preserve what has not yet been seized.\nWithout seizing, there is no loss.\nThus, though one may host a hundred affairs, the world comes as a guest.\nYet if one clings stubbornly to past knowledge as an unchanging rule,\nEach day brings accumulation of gain—and with it, mounting loss.\nThus the moon borrows brightness from the sun, yet with each dawn, the true moon dies.\nHow can one forsake this inexhaustible treasury to curry favor with the world’s eyes and ears?\nThe world is boundless: those who seize bring gratitude, but those who lose harbor resentment;\nThose who gain find fulfillment, but those who lose suffer ruin.\nThis is why even the highest rites cannot escape grasping arms, and why countless carriages end up with no carriage at all.】\n\nThe sage is ever without a heart of his own, taking the hearts of the people as his heart.\nTo the good, I am good;\nTo the not good, I am also good—thus virtue is goodness.\nTo the trustworthy, I am trustworthy;\nTo the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—thus virtue is trustworthiness.\nIn the world, the sage is all-embracing,\nUnifying the hearts of the world.\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.\n\nForty-Ninth Chapter\n【Even with a sage, how could the world’s people all become like children?\nFrom the One arise Two, and with Two come yin and yang;\nFrom yin and yang come nature and emotion;\nFrom nature and emotion come right and wrong.\nWhen nature and emotion congeal and cling to the semblances of yin and yang, will they then be taken as constant?\nWhat is constant in this is inconstant in that.\nOnly by grasping the Great Constant without clinging to constancy\nCan one let the extremes of yang’s excess and yin’s stagnation run their course,\nSo that the people may await their arrival as passively as scorched earth or flooding waters;\nAs gently as a breeze, while the people become like panpipes and zithers.\nIf there is overflow yet no reception, if there is sound yet no retention,\nThen goodness comes to roost like a child learning speech beside its elders—\nHow much more so for those who fix their ears and eyes on what is not good?\nAlas! Many in the world have eyes and fix their gaze—\nThose who make themselves a target will also be gazed upon.\nThe sage does not become a target, and thus the world becomes childlike from this.】\n\nFrom birth to death.\n\nFrom birth to death—\nThose bound for life number thirteen;\nthose bound for death number thirteen;\nand those who, while alive, move toward death’s realm also number thirteen.\n[Su Ziyou says: \"Nine are the paths of life and death, yet there is one path of neither life nor death.\"]\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they cling to life too heavily.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in nurturing life\nwalk the road without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter the army without being struck by armor or blade.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to unsheathe its claws,\nthe blade no place to lodge its edge.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they dwell in no realm of death.\n\nChapter Fifty:\nThere are realms of death, but no realms of life.\nWhere there is no realm, there is life;\nwhere there is a realm, there is death.\nLet us examine this in detail.\nWhen a person is born, the spirit abandons emptiness to take up function,\nthe form severs itself from solidity to cultivate the insubstantial—\nis this not emergence?\nYet when qi makes emptiness its dwelling,\nand form makes earth its substance,\nis this not entry into death?\n\nNevertheless, having been born,\none assumes that what has emerged can be perpetuated,\ndrawing out threads to spawn further life,\nroaming while clinging to a realm—\nthus death is indeed death in stillness,\nand life is also death in motion.\nThose who die in motion\ncan be still, yet cannot be still within motion.\nTo be still within motion is to move within stillness,\nto employ both motion and stillness while using neither.\nTo be still within motion is to name motion as stillness;\nonce named as stillness, stillness gladly returns to it—\nthis is what is meant by \"maintaining stillness with single-mindedness.\"\nTo move within stillness is to name stillness as motion;\nonce named as motion, stillness revolves with it and does not die—\nthis is what is meant by \"reversion is the movement of the Dao.\"\n\nThus, there are three who cling to realms,\nthree who take no realm as their realm,\nand three who hasten toward realms yet ultimately attain no realm.\nBeyond these nine, the subtlety of the One is difficult to express!\nYet those who nurture life employ motion,\nand those who hasten toward death also employ motion.\nHow can this be demonstrated?\nThose who nurture life worry over attaining a realm and move to depart from it.\nThose who hasten toward death worry over not attaining a realm and move to enter it.\nThough they daily traverse the boundary between emergence and entry,\nhow can they truly know motion?\nHow grave, then, is the peril of realms!\nThe rhinoceros’s assault must press upon the earth to display its power;\nthe blade’s killing must contend for a realm to secure victory.\nWhen they encounter one who dwells in no realm,\nall lose their murderous intent.\nThe killing is not in them—\ndeath departs from me.\nThus, riding the wind’s sound, one moves lightly and well;\nthus, Cloud General speaks freely and roams.\n\nThe Dao gives them life,\nvirtue nurtures them—\n[The function of the Dao is called virtue.]\nit shapes their forms,\nand circumstances bring them to completion.\n[All is the Dao’s spontaneity.]\nTherefore, the myriad things\nrevere the Dao and honor virtue without exception.\nThe Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—\nnothing commands this, yet it is ever spontaneous.\n\nThus, the Dao gives them life,\nvirtue nurtures them;\nit rears them, raises them,\nbrings them to fruition, ripens them,\nfosters them, shelters them.\n[Lu Xisheng says:\n\"Receiving its essence is called life;\ncontaining its qi is called nurturing;\ndeveloping its form is called rearing;\nnurturing its material is called raising;\nweighing its completion is called fruition;\nmeasuring its use is called ripening;\npreserving its harmony is called fostering;\nsecuring its life is called sheltering.\"]\nIt gives life yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely,\nrears yet does not govern.\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nChapter Fifty-One.\n\nSince the Dao has already given life—why should I give life?\nSince the Dao has already nurtured and sheltered—why should I act?\nWhy should I rear?\n\nThe neighbor cooks his granary’s grain to fill his own belly,\nthen smugly declares, “I fed myself”—who would believe him?\nYet he has never eaten from me,\nand never fails to eat from this.\n\nI alone perceive and know it,\nfollow and embrace it.\nThe world does not know me, yet accords me virtue;\nI, in turn, have no choice but to accord it virtue.\n\nThings take form,\ncircumstances reach completion.\nThough I perceive and know them, I do not name them in words;\nthough I follow and embrace them, I do not alter or displace them.\nThough those who accord me virtue do not know me,\nthrough all ages they trust it.\nThus, because the myriad things do not know one another,\nit may be called profound virtue.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the world’s mother.\nOnce you grasp the mother,\nyou know her children.\nIf you then guard the mother,\nyou will not perish to the end of your days.\n\nBlock the openings,\nshut the gates—\nand you will not toil all your life.\nOpen the openings,\naid in affairs—\nand you will not be saved all your life.\n\nTo see the small is called clarity;\nto guard the soft is called strength.\nUse its light,\nreturn to its clarity,\nand no misfortune will befall you.\nThis is called embracing the constant.\n\nChapter Fifty-Two.\n\n[On “beginning,” there are three senses:\nThe Confucian speaks of beginning as holding authority;\nthe Buddhist speaks of beginning as encompassing all;\nthis “beginning” speaks of life-in-motion.\nWhat moves in life is qi,\nyet it is not merely qi.\nIf it were only qi,\nthen as it moves in life there,\nhere it would already be hollow.\nFilled there, not empty here;\nborn before Heaven and Earth,\nyet dying after Heaven and Earth;\nits breath so subtle, its use without trace.\nSmall and without attachment—how much more so the great?\nWeak and not needing “use”—how much more so “strength”?\nWhom then could we follow to attain our “seeing” and “guarding”?\n\nThus, when we “guard” and “know,”\n“knowing” lies in “guarding”;\nwhen we “know” and “guard,”\n“guarding” lies in “knowing.”\nLife and breath endless,\nthe mechanism ripples in the vast.\nSeek to grasp it, and it has already fled;\nseek to examine it, and it has already shifted.\nSwift and fleeting, scattered and dispersed—\nwhere is the “constant”?\nYet within its inconstancy,\nit secretly embodies the “constant.”\nHow could this lie at the bounds of “child” and “mother”?\n\nIf not so—\nwith the limited use of one’s own knowledge and strength,\nchasing the transformations of “child” and “mother,”\none will hardly escape misfortune.]\n\nWere I to have even a little knowledge,\nand walk the great Dao,\nI would fear only deviation.\nThe great Dao is level,\nyet people prefer byways.\n\nThe court is swept clean,\nthe fields lie fallow,\nthe granaries are empty.\nYet they wear embroidered robes,\nbear sharp swords,\ngorge on food and drink,\nhoard surplus wealth—\nthese are the pipes of thieves.\nHow could this be the Dao?\n\nChapter Fifty-Three: *The Malady of Zhou’s Flourishing Culture*\n\nThe world cannot endure \"knowledge.\"\nWhen \"knowledge\" is put into practice,\nthe true forms of things die within one’s ears and eyes,\nand ears and eyes, too, will die within those forms.\n\nThen should knowledge be abandoned?\nYet knowledge cannot be abandoned.\nThere are those who possess knowledge,\nand those who employ my knowledge.\nThe knower claims long-standing mastery,\nwhile the one who employs my knowledge uses only its \"fragmentary\" aspect.\nKnowing the impermanence of the \"fragmentary,\"\none harbors no lingering attachments.\nWith no lingering attachments,\nthe world does not envy what one clings to.\nThough practice may not be feared,\nhow much less so knowledge?\n\nA fleeting gleam,\nyet the reliance of a lifetime;\nwhat one exalts,\nothers will follow and exalt.\nWang Mang and Cao Cao revering Yao and Shun as their *yu*,\nthe Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows revering Tang and Wu as their *yu*—\nthese are no different from the perverse qi of yin and yang\nrevering stagnant, congealed qi as their *yu*,\nthereby stealing life.\n\nThat the Dao cannot be walked in a \"fragmentary\" manner—\nis it not thus?\n\nThe well-established cannot be uprooted—\n*(Lü Jifu says: \"Established through constant non-being.\")*\nThe well-embraced cannot slip away—\n*(Lü Jifu says: \"Embracing spirit through stillness.\")*\nThus descendants maintain unbroken sacrifices.\n\nCultivated in the self,\nits virtue becomes authentic;\ncultivated in the family,\nits virtue becomes abundant;\ncultivated in the village,\nits virtue becomes enduring;\ncultivated in the state,\nits virtue becomes bountiful;\ncultivated throughout the world,\nits virtue becomes universal.\n\nTherefore, observe the self through the self,\nobserve the family through the family,\nobserve the village through the village,\nobserve the state through the state,\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\n*(When one establishes self, world, state, and family, they divide into factions.\nThat faction \"establishes,\" while this faction is \"uprooted\";\nthat faction \"embraces,\" while this faction \"slips away.\"\nYet can one of the Dao forcibly equalize and apply both?\nAffairs each have their form, circumstances each their shape—\nobserving accordingly, one may avoid contention.\nFlowing within these shapes and circumstances,\nusing what cannot be used to make them self-reliant—\nthis is called \"knowing through this.\"\nWhen there is no \"self,\" what \"observation\" of self?\nWhen there is no village, state, or world, what \"observation\" of mine?\nWhen there is no \"this,\" then there is \"this.\"\nDissolving what is natural, coalescing what is inevitable—\nnot only do factions vanish, but the truth of self and things appears,\nliquefying and interpenetrating, solidifying into endless longevity.\nThis is called \"dying yet not perishing.\")*\n\nOne whose virtue is profoundly stored\nis like a newborn child.\n\nA venomous creature does not sting him,\na fierce beast does not seize him,\na grasping bird does not strike him.\nHis bones are weak, his sinews soft, yet his grip is firm.\nHe knows not the union of male and female, yet his organ stirs—\nsuch is the perfection of his essence.\nHe cries all day without growing hoarse—\nsuch is the perfection of his harmony.\n[Viewed thus, man is never without essence, never without harmony.\nYet if one were to establish teaching on this basis,\nthere would still be those who cling to the crash of a falling object as their original face.]\n\nTo know harmony is called \"constancy,\"\nto know constancy is called \"clarity.\"\nTo seek excess in life is called \"ominous.\"\n[To seek to augment one’s life is to invite disaster.]\nThe heart that commands qi is called \"forceful.\"\n[Qi arises from essence and harmony, yet one forces it to be hard and restless.]\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nthis is called \"not following the Dao,\"\nwhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\n[Chapter 55]\n\nTo bear alone the boundlessness of all under heaven is impossible.\nAnxious that it cannot be borne, one’s heart races and qi scatters,\ninner strife erupts and outward betrayal follows.\nYet still one establishes virtue as virtue,\nspewing it forth as an external display,\nunaware that within there is no clarity.\nTo contain and be like a newborn child is to have virtue without establishing virtue;\nwhen virtue does not establish virtue,\ntaking and rejecting leave no trace;\nno trace, then there is \"harmony.\"\nNot establishing virtue as virtue,\nyin and yang return to unity,\nyin and yang return to unity, then there is \"essence.\"\nSuch a one—though immeasurably rich, needs no resources,\nthough immensely strong, cannot be broken—\ncould there yet be the afflictions of \"commanding qi\" or \"augmenting life\"?\nThus, close the doors and windows,\nand the six directions cease to exist;\nguard it in deep slumber,\nand wind and thunder vanish.\n\nThe perfected person embodies boundless transformation,\nas the infant manifests effortless resonance.\n\nThose who know do not speak;\nthose who speak do not know.\nNot only do they prevent others from glimpsing their joy or anger,\nbut they also ensure the Dao remains unbroken by union or separation.\n\nBlock the apertures, seal the gates,\nblunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,\nharmonize the radiance, merge with the dust—\nthis is called \"mysterious sameness.\"\n\nThus, they cannot be drawn near,\nnor can they be kept distant;\napproach them, and they seem utterly unlike,\nyet turn away, and they do not depart from this.\n\nThey cannot be benefited,\nnor can they be harmed;\nrain cannot moisten the void to bring forth life,\nnor can the sun scorch the void to produce heat.\n\nThey cannot be exalted,\nnor can they be debased.\nExaltation and debasement are but names—\nfrom exaltation arises debasement.\nWithout names, there is neither exaltation nor debasement,\nand thus they are honored by all under heaven.\n\nAs Yan Junping said:\nThe five flavors linger on the tongue, the five tones resonate in the ear—\nwhat is sweet is not truly sweet, what is bitter is not truly bitter,\nwhat is *shang* is not truly *shang*, what is *yu* is not truly *yu*,\nyet Yi Ya and Shi Kuang could distinguish them.\nIf even sounds and flavors are thus,\nhow much more so the subtle Dao?\nThe perfected person’s dwelling and movement—\nwhen manifest, they share the same root with the myriad things;\nwhen hidden, they merge their origin with emptiness and nothingness.\nSpeech and silence adapt to the moment without distinction,\nspontaneous words arise daily to respond to change—\nthis is truly called \"mysterious sameness.\"\n\nChapter Fifty-Six\n\nIf one seeks to align with what is alike,\nthen one must also diverge from what is different.\nWhat I esteem, others may despise;\nwhat I despise, others may esteem—\nwhy is this?\nBecause my esteem reveals others’ disdain,\nand my disdain reveals others’ esteem.\nOnly one who does not transgress against things\nwill find that things do not transgress against them.\nNot that they do not transgress—\nthings simply cannot transgress against them at all.\nThus, they let things drift and dissolve,\nsit and grow old with them,\nwhether bright as a row of torches,\ndark as sunken earth,\nsharp as Gan Jiang’s blade,\nor tangled as a skein of silk—\nthey listen to the endless flux of right and wrong\nyet never contend for sameness as a mark of worth.\nThus, they rise above all under heaven,\ngazing upon the fortunes and misfortunes of the world.\n\nProfound! Profound indeed!\n\nYet how can mere words suffice to establish this?\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\ndeploy troops with cunning,\nand take all under heaven through non-action.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more taboos under heaven, the poorer the people grow;\nthe more sharp tools people possess, the more benighted the state becomes;\nthe more skill and craft proliferate, the more strange things arise;\nthe more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear.\nThus the sage declares:\nI practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;\nI cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;\nI engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves;\nI harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\n\nChapter Fifty-Seven\n\nThere are things under heaven that remain ungoverned—yet when one seeks to govern them, nothing but \"uprightness\" can achieve success. Using \"uprightness\" to correct what is not upright, how can one know that what is called \"upright\" will not itself become crooked? Thus \"uprightness\" must lead to \"cunning,\" and governing the state must lead to deploying troops.\n\nNow, one who practices non-action corrects what uprightness corrects yet does not govern—so even those who might wish to employ cunning find themselves obstructed by the absence of suspicion, and I thereby sit and take all under heaven. Those who are ever-active and meddlesome do otherwise, saying, \"Governance is the natural state of things, while deploying troops is my last resort.\" Just as they share with all under heaven the peace and prosperity of stability, to call this a last resort—whose sorrow is this deception meant to assuage?\n\nThus, without names, there are no implements;\nwithout implements, there is no advantage;\nwithout advantage, there is no craft;\nwithout craft, laws have nothing to test.\nTherefore, those who wish to end warfare must first abandon governance.\n\nThe governance of the Dao is dull and unadorned, and its people are simple and sincere;\nits governance is sharp and exacting, and its people are lacking and deficient.\nThus the sage is square but does not cut,\nis sharp-edged but does not wound,\nis straight but does not stretch,\nis radiant but does not dazzle.\n\nMisfortune—how fortune leans upon it;\nfortune—how misfortune lies hidden within it.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nThere is no fixed norm.\n\n[Having circled and soared through the interplay of principle and fate, one comes to know there is no fixed norm. Those who sharply discern and rush to welcome fortune while shunning misfortune believe there is a fixed norm.]\n\nThe fixed norm reverts to the strange,\ngoodness reverts to the ominous.\nPeople’s delusion has endured for so long.\n\n(Chapter 58)\n\n[If there truly is no \"fixed norm,\" then why does the sage not also discard \"square,\" \"sharp-edged,\" \"straight,\" and \"radiant\"? To discard is necessarily to overcorrect, and today’s overcorrection becomes what later generations must correct. When a bow is drawn, its back bends outward; when released, its back bends inward. Does this mean nothing in the world can ever be right?\n\nThe sage, knowing there is no fixed norm, also knows there is no strange—only ever following the mean. \"What people fear, one dare not fail to fear\": thus the good cannot wield names to impose demands. \"All under heaven fix their gaze upon me, and I treat them all as children\": thus the unvirtuous cannot erect barriers to contend. Therefore, by keeping far from the harm of \"cutting,\" \"wounding,\" \"stretching,\" and \"dazzling,\" and by preserving the shelter of \"square,\" \"sharp-edged,\" \"straight,\" and \"radiant,\" the workings of fate lose their good and ominous turns, and the strange and the fixed norm are forgotten in name and reality.\n\nOtherwise, seeking fortune by avoiding misfortune through accommodation only deepens delusion and hastens the ominous.]\n\nGoverning people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality.\nTo be frugal is to be early in compliance;\nearly compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue.\n[Han Fei says: Thoughts settled, thus virtue does not depart;\nthe apertures empty, then harmonious qi enters daily.]\nWith repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing that cannot be overcome;\nnothing that cannot be overcome—then none know its limit.\nNone knowing its limit, one may possess the state.\nPossessing the state’s foundational power, one may endure long.\nThis is called the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, of long life and enduring vision.\n\nChapter Fifty-Nine\n[The passions of \"people\" are boundless; to take and \"govern\" them is to fall short of most passions. The reckonings of \"Heaven\" are infinite; to proceed and \"serve\" them is to find the unattainable ever distant. Following their exhausting exhaustions, chasing their vast vastness—this hopes for that one’s favor, while that one hopes for this, breeding resentment. Resentment cannot sustain a state, and exhausting oneself year after year also rots the \"root\" and withers the \"stem,\" so that one’s \"life\" does not extend. By the time it fails to extend, regretfully seeking \"compliance\"—is it not too late!\n\nAbiding at the center of the circle, there is little to \"govern,\" little to \"serve.\" Though passions are myriad, the passionate are one; though reckonings are myriad, the reckoning reckoners are not one. Some suspect stinginess and lack of virtue, yet the virtue of non-virtue means Heaven and humanity harbor no expectations at the outset, and thus no resentment or sorrow at the end. Yet in striking aside to guide the joints, provisions are inexhaustible—can there ever be an end?\n\nThus the male’s butting has its limit, while the female’s receptivity knows no cease. The one who \"repeatedly accumulates virtue\" finds the world drawn to her receptivity and returning to me. Seated in emptiness to discourse with all under Heaven—this is how the twofold difficulty of \"possessing the state\" and \"enduring long\" are both resolved here. Resolved here, then what could fail to be resolved here?]\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWith the Dao presiding over all under Heaven, its ghosts do not act as spirits;\nNot that its ghosts do not act as spirits, but their spirit does not harm people;\nNot that their spirit does not harm people, but the sage also does not harm people.\nWhen the two do not harm one another, their virtues converge and return together.\n\nChapter Sixty\n\nTo move the forms of all under Heaven is to leave behind its qi;\nTo move the qi of all under Heaven is to move without remainder.\n\"Cooking a small fish\" yet disturbing it—though the small fish itself is never harmed, its qi is already injured.\nWhen its qi is injured, the qi then rises in rebellion and retaliates.\nAll under Heaven has its \"ghosts and spirits,\" kneading order and chaos in the formless;\nOur bodies have their \"ghosts and spirits,\" stirring life and death in the formless.\nThe moment the mechanism of killing stirs, dragons and serpents rise from the land, and the power of life is ravaged.\nIn stillness, there is nothing; in motion, there is something—when spirits \"harm people,\" how fearful!\n\"Bearing the soul and embracing the One without parting\"—\npreserve them together in the water before it ripples.\nHow could one govern all under Heaven?\nSimply \"preside\" over it.\n\nThe great state lies in the lower reaches, the female of all under Heaven, the confluence of all under Heaven.\nThe female ever overcomes the male through stillness, through stillness holds the lower position.\n【Stillness dwelling below, profound virtue bears all things.】\nThus when the great state humbles itself before the small state, it wins the small state;\nwhen the small state humbles itself before the great state, it wins the great state.\nTherefore, some humble themselves to win, some humble themselves and win.\nThe great state desires only to shelter and nurture others;\nthe small state desires only to enter and serve others.\nBoth obtain what they desire, yet the greater should take the lower position.\n\nChapter Sixty-One\n【The Dao’s subtlety lies in receptivity.\nTo be receptive yet move—this is called \"receptive\" in name but not in reality.\nTo desire receptivity and move—this is truly receptive in reality but not in name.\nAll under Heaven responds in reality but contends over names;\nyin and yang in relation to humanity are inherently thus—how much more so human affairs?\nPushed to its extreme, the desire to \"shelter and nurture others\" is not truly nurturing others;\nthe desire to \"enter and serve others\" is not truly serving others.\nWhy? Reality is originally movement—how much less can one remain still when desire is involved?\nThe greater it is, the more it can receive.\nIf one can become the convergence of yin and yang, one’s position below becomes even more pronounced.\nStill the desires, still the movements—this is how rivers and seas become the kings of all valleys.】\nThe Dao is the mystery of the ten thousand things.\n\nThe treasure of the good person is what the unvirtuous cling to.\nFair words can purchase esteem, and esteemed conduct can be imposed upon others.\n【Though the unvirtuous cling to it, this is why the good is prized.\nYet if one could purchase esteem but does not, could impose but does not—this is the mystery.】\nWhy discard those who are not good?\nThus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,\nthough one may offer a large jade disk before a team of four horses,\nit is not equal to quietly presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy was this Dao prized in ancient times?\nWas it not said: \"Seek and you shall obtain; with transgressions, you shall be absolved\"?\nThus it is treasured under Heaven.\n\nChapter Sixty-Two\n【By this we may verify: does the one who embodies the Dao necessarily make no requests, nor ever conceal transgressions?\nTo make no requests is to be cut off; to conceal transgressions is to invite defilement—one who embodies the Dao does not dwell in these.\nAll under Heaven lies within the Dao; the good and the unvirtuous are but its transformative traces, while the Dao is their bellows and pipes.\nThus, there is nothing to choose, and one may deepen one’s breath thereby.\nTo know there is something to choose is to value the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes, to prize the large jade disk and the team of four horses as mere ornament—how could this be the Dao?\nAt times one may seek, yet never hoard treasure to isolate oneself;\none may wish to avoid transgression, yet never lose one’s safeguard to stand alone.\nHarmonizing right and wrong and resting in the balance of Heaven,\nall under Heaven becomes one with the Dao—who then could deem it base?】\n\nTo act without acting, to manage without managing, to savor the savorless.\nGreat or small, many or few—repay resentment with virtue.\n[Lü Jifu says: Returning to nothingness, thus one may be great, may be small, may be many, may be few.]\n\nPlan for difficulty while it is still easy; achieve greatness while it is still small.\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin with what is easy; the world’s great tasks must begin with what is minute.\nThus the sage never strives for greatness, and so accomplishes greatness.\nOne who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted; one who treats much as easy will meet much difficulty.\nThus the sage treats all as difficult, and so ultimately meets no difficulty.\n\nChapter Sixty-Three\n[What stirs growth and nurtures life—this is what people call “great.”\nThe exchange of kindness and resentment—this is what people call “difficult.”\nAutumn’s fallen leaves are spring’s flourishing;\ndense clouds gather, and rain dissolves them—\nnot that they are truly “great” or “difficult,” as careful observation reveals.\nIs the Dao not like water?\nEmerging subtly from peril, its flowing current never brims.\nWhen full, it follows the end and appears full, unaware of the source that sustains it.\nWere it so, the sage would be exhausted—\nyet by relying on nothingness, he remains unwearied.\nWithout “greatness,” he is as if “minute”; without “ease,” he is as if “difficult.”\nPreserving nothingness, he finds nothing beyond his grasp.\nWhat is difficult? Only to preserve nothingness.]\n\nWhat is secure is easy to hold; what shows no sign is easy to plan for.\nWhat is fragile is easy to dissolve; what is subtle is easy to scatter.\n[The Dao inherently possesses these four subtle signs.]\nAct before things arise; govern before disorder begins.\nA tree of arm-span girth grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;\na journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one’s feet.\n[Even when fully grown, it still has its sprout; even when complete, it still relies on piled earth—though a thousand miles, it is no more than a step.]\nOne who acts fails; one who grasps loses.\n[Su Ziyou says: Contending with misfortune for victory, adding to fortune as excess—thus misfortune cannot be averted, and fortune cannot be achieved.]\nThus the sage does not act, and so does not fail; does not grasp, and so does not lose.\nPeople in their undertakings often fail when nearly complete.\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure.\nThus the sage desires what others do not desire, does not prize rare and precious goods;\nlearns what others do not learn, restores what the multitude has passed over.\n[Liu Zhongping says: Desiring what others do not desire, not desiring what others desire;\nlearning what others do not learn, not learning what others learn—\nthus restoring what they have passed over.]\nHe relies on the spontaneity of the myriad things and does not dare to act.\n\nChapter Sixty-Four\n[Those who lose the Dao do not seek good fortune first or add to blessings as excess.\nTo govern by anticipating what has not yet arisen or what is not yet in disorder is to act by meeting too soon.\nTo be cautious when nearly complete is to act by following too closely.\nThat meeting and following are not the Dao has long been so—\nis it not because they constantly go back and forth and thus fall into exhaustion?\nWho knows that what has gone is even now coming, and what is coming is even now going?\nAnd who knows that what has gone has never truly gone, and what is coming has never truly come?\nBeware of following, for it begins as if meeting;\nbeware of meeting, for it begins as if following.\nAnd who knows that meeting and following can be avoided, while avoiding meeting and following can also be guarded against?\nWhether exhausted or avoided, one follows things.\nTo guard against both and attend to what is easy is to follow the Dao.\nOne who follows things is not constant; one who follows the Dao attains unity.\nWith unity, nothing to rely on—anticipating signs and “serving early”—\nthis is how one “relies on the spontaneity of the myriad things and does not dare to act.”]\n\nThose of old who were skilled in the Dao did not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because they possess too much knowledge.\nThus, governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane;\ngoverning the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing.\nTo know these two is also a model.\nAlways knowing this model is called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue runs deep and far, moving contrary to things,\nand this contrariness leads to great compliance.\n\n[Lu Jifu says: To return to the root contrary to things is to go against the current.]\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because they possess too much knowledge.\nThus, those who govern with knowledge are the state’s bane;\nthose who govern without knowledge are the state’s blessing.\nTo know these two is also a model.\nAlways knowing this model is called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue runs deep and far, moving contrary to things,\nand this contrariness leads to great compliance.\n\nWhen one complies, one grows with the world—\ngrowing knowledge, growing ignorance;\ngrowing fortune, growing misfortune;\ngrowing virtue, growing bane.\nNothing is certain in what grows, and compliance does not endure.\nIn guarding, I guard myself, and the world guards itself,\nwithout mutual instruction.\nThe Dao’s way of bestowing this world is such that\nthe world does not belong to me, nor I to the world—\nthis “model” has long been thus and remains unchanging.\nIf one imitates this “model” by multiplying jars and urns,\nthe earth will crack upon the hills;\nif one learns this “pattern” by multiplying ritual vessels,\nthe trees will wither upon the mountains.\nWould the world then be my jars and urns, my ritual vessels?\nThey would not submit, and resentment and harm would arise.\nWhen things desire to sprout, and I stop them at the bud,\nthe world preserves its richness.\nWhen the heart desires to sprout, and I stop it at the incipient,\nthe hun and po preserve their constant brightness.\nThis is not to “make them simple” by design—\nwhat is called “enlightening” is not true enlightenment.\n\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys\nis that they are good at lying low.\nThus, if the sage wishes to be above the people,\nhe must speak as if below them;\nif he wishes to lead the people,\nhe must place himself behind them.\nThus, the sage dwells above, yet the people do not feel burdened—\n[the people do not feel burdened, for the weight remains with him.\nGenerally, the higher is light and the lower heavy.\nTo dwell above without imposing weight on others—\nonly the sage can do this.]\nHe dwells ahead, yet the people do not feel harmed.\nThus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring.\nBecause he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.\n\n[To lower oneself is not easy; to be “good at lowering” is even harder.\nThus, few in the world become rivers and seas.\nIf one seeks to suppress, the reaction will surely be extreme;\nif one seeks to dredge, it will only deepen the unevenness.\nAnd this is not all.]\n\nStanding alone yet drawing all things to itself—such accumulation must be profound. When accumulation is profound yet nothing is discharged, attempts to suppress or dredge it will fail. Thus, only rivers and seas are \"adept at lowering.\" Rivers flow into the sea, and the sea has its tail-gate. When the sage possesses virtue, transgressions pass without lingering. Receiving the world’s submission yet never sated, how could the world grow weary of him? Therefore, he returns his breath to his heels, his heels to heaven, illumines all with spontaneity, and transforms his long-held qi, entering the \"Vast Heavenly Oneness.\"\n\nThe world says my Dao is great, yet seems formless. Precisely because it is great, it appears formless. Were it to take form, it would long since have been diminished! I possess three treasures, which I hold and preserve:\nThe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to place myself before the world.\nCompassion enables courage;\nfrugality enables abundance;\nnot daring to place myself before the world enables me to become the vessel’s chief.\nNow, to abandon compassion yet claim courage,\nto abandon frugality yet claim abundance,\nto abandon humility yet claim precedence—\nthis is death!\nWith compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.\nHeaven will save such a one, shielding him with compassion.\n\nA skilled warrior is not martial;\na master of war is not enraged;\none who conquers the enemy does not engage;\none who employs others places himself below them.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe power of employing others’ strength,\nthe alignment with heaven’s ancient ultimate.\n\nAvoiding killing cannot endure, just as delighting in killing cannot last. Some act from desire, others from aversion—both claim life and death lie in their grasp, usurping heaven’s authority. If one does not indulge in delight, what need is there for avoidance? Thus, those who \"govern with uprightness\" seek to quell arms, yet arms arise all the more. The \"skilled warrior\" may deploy troops, yet no harm is done. To know heaven’s transformative traces is to see thunder and lightning without joy or anger. To know the ancient \"model\" is to witness growth and decline without killing or giving life. How could one who embodies the Dao employ others by asserting himself? He follows what is already so and thus employs them.\n\nOn the use of arms, there is a saying:\nI dare not act as host, but as guest;\nI dare not advance an inch, but retreat a foot.\nThis is called marching without ranks,\nstriking without arms,\nseizing without foes,\nwielding without weapons.\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.\nThus, when evenly matched forces meet,\nthe grieving side prevails.\n\nThe Dao in the world is no different.\nYet this is but one instance—Chapter Sixty-Nine.\n\nAbiding in the palace of the Dao, one is neither \"host\" nor \"guest\";\nriding the momentum of the Dao, one both \"advances\" and \"retreats.\"\nYet the \"host\" knows not the \"guest,\" while the \"guest\" knows the \"host\"—\nthrough their mutual knowledge, one infers the use of neither \"host\" nor \"guest.\"\n\"Advance\" leaves no ground for \"retreat,\" while \"retreat\" holds ground for \"advance\"—\nby its surplus space, one seizes the subtlety of both \"advance\" and \"retreat.\"\nBetween \"host\" and \"guest\" lies a palace;\nbeyond \"advance\" and \"retreat\" lies their application.\n\"Without ranks,\" \"without arms,\" \"without foes,\" \"without weapons\"—\nsuch is this way.\nAvoiding deadly ground to attain \"subtle clarity,\"\nwhat else awaits if not victory?\nShould one seek this momentum in haste yet fail to grasp it,\nwhat then is to be done?\nIs there not recourse in reversing the situation and employing its nature?\nProceeding with \"grief\" in one’s \"inevitability,\"\none restrains one’s anger and does not lose one’s \"Three Treasures.\"\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\n\nThe world knows it not, practices it not.\nWords have their lineage, affairs have their lord.\nOnly through unknowing—\n【things follow their nature, not my words, not my deeds,\nyet I too abide therein unknowing】—\ndo they fail to know me.\nThose who know me are rare,\nthus those who emulate me are precious.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\n\nChapter Seventy\n\nGreat clamor arises from great silence,\ngreat life begins in non-life.\nRiding its clamor to harmonize with it—\nharmony cannot prevail.\nChasing its transformations to nurture them—\nnurturing cannot prevail.\nBlowing through reed pipes with the lips,\nthe fingers cannot pluck the zither;\ngazing upward to catch the cicada,\none cannot stoop to seize the grub.\nThus the world’s words become lips or fingers;\nthe world’s affairs become catching or seizing.\nEver chasing what is difficult yet never encountering it,\none hollowly boasts of one’s vast knowledge—\nhow could there be those who truly know me?\nMy own dwelling in \"rarity\"—\ncan the world not but \"rare\" itself?\nThus the great valley holds no faintest sound,\nand the great transformation bears no infant form.\n\nRejecting clamor and remaining unmoved by change,\none dons coarse cloth to delight in this \"ease,\"\nwhile holding jade within to subtly embody its \"rarity.\"\n\nTo know yet to know not—this is noble;\nto know not yet to know—this is sickness.\nThe sage is not sick, for he sickens of sickness.\nOnly by sickening of sickness does one not fall sick.\n\nChapter Seventy-One\nHeaven and earth employ the world to toil me—only when they know me;\nthey appoint me to carve up the world—only when they know the world.\nHow could it be merely that the world cannot be fully known?\nEven the knower, leaning at the edge of bounds, loses the flowing current.\nThus the sage, with oxen, forgets the plow;\nwith horses, forgets the harness;\nwith fields, forgets the tilling;\nwith timber, forgets the vessel.\nOblivious to himself, he does not see his storehouse;\noblivious to the world, he has no office to hold.\nAs for those who regulate the realm of the ten thousand clans\nand emulate the positions of the hundred bones,\nthere are already those who came before me, peddling their surplus knowledge.\nJust as they imitate it to toil themselves,\nand suffer from its many omissions,\nsinking and floating in new knowledge,\nfleeing old vessels—\nhow could they not fall sick?\n\nWhen the people do not fear power, then great power arrives.\n[Li Xizhai says: \"When the people do not fear power, none but those who have forgotten both self and world can achieve this.\"]\nDo not encroach upon their dwelling,\ndo not weary their livelihood.\nOnly by not wearying them do they not grow weary.\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself;\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore, he discards that and takes this.\n\nChapter Seventy-Two\n\nThose who indulge in being perish in non-being,\nfilling their voids only augments their fullness.\nLift a hand or cast a glance—nowhere is not \"narrow\";\nlift a hand or cast a glance—nowhere is not \"weary.\"\n\nThere are those who *dwell*, and those who dwell *in dwelling*;\nthere are those who *live*, and those who live *in living*.\nThose who dwell *in dwelling* merge with the inner reaches of dwelling,\nvast and boundless, swirling and turning, broader than heaven and earth.\nThose who live *in living* preserve the harmony of living,\ngentle and yielding, carefree and at ease, delighting in the spring terrace.\nYet to abandon one’s own joy, to block one’s own vastness—how lamentable!\nRestless through the night, unable to rely on oneself, seeking aid in \"power.\"\n\nThus, discard \"display\" and one’s narrowness becomes vast;\ndiscard \"exaltation\" and joy is no longer dependent on joy.\nDaily wandering in tranquility and distance,\ndissolving the boundless,\nexpansive with abundance,\nfulfilled with aptness.\nForget the world and it becomes no burden;\nthe world, too, will forget you.\n\nFor those who dwell *in dwelling* and live *in living* are the world’s inherent nature—\nwhy then should I \"display\" or \"exalt\" anything?\n\nCourage in daring leads to death;\ncourage in not-daring leads to life.\nThese two—one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWho knows the reason for what Heaven abhors?\n\nThe Way of Heaven:\ntriumphs without contention,\nresponds without speech,\narrives without summons,\nplans with ease and spaciousness.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nsparse yet never failing.\n\nChapter Seventy-Three\n\nGrasping \"not-daring\" with \"courage\" is *daring* indeed;\n\"not-daring\" in what one \"does not dare\" is *courage* indeed.\nThe application of \"courage\" and \"daring\"\nbrings the retribution of \"death\" and \"life.\"\nHeaven wields its authority,\nwhile we endure its changes—how *difficult*!\n\nThe sage fears this \"difficulty,\"\nyet embraces \"life,\"\nwithout shunning \"death.\"\nThus \"life\" rests with oneself,\nwhile \"death\" is left to the world.\nWhy? If one claims \"life\" for oneself,\nthere must be those who bear \"death\"—\nsuch is the inevitability of qi and fate,\nbeyond reproach.\n\nOnly when one’s own \"life\" is not a matter of merit,\nand the world’s \"death\" cannot be blamed,\ndoes one stand beyond reward and punishment,\nskillfully saving all beings.\nI am free of \"death\" and \"life,\"\nand the world, too, attains \"life.\"\n\nThose bound by qi and fate\ntoil endlessly over \"death\" and \"life,\"\nwhile to me,\nthey are but the whistling of a sword’s tip.\nThus the sage breaks through \"Heaven’s net\"\nto follow the \"Way of Heaven.\"\n\nThe people do not fear death—why threaten them with it? If the people could always be made to fear death, then for those who act perversely, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? There is always an executioner who kills. To take the executioner’s place in killing is like taking the master carpenter’s place in hewing—those who replace the master carpenter in hewing rarely avoid injuring their own hands.\n\nChapter Seventy-Four\n\nWood meets the axe—how could it evade being split, whether hard or brittle? Thus Robber Zhi and Bao Jiao mocked each other endlessly. To pick apart their mockery, deeming some right and some wrong, and cling to chaff to force belief upon those who firmly disbelieve—this is to exploit another’s death to prove one’s own gain, seeking profit from it. Those who delight in killing harm nothing in the world, yet only strip away their own harmony.\n\nThe sage, knowing the inevitability of such patterns, pities Heaven and witnesses the transformations with open eyes. Transformations daily shift, and one cannot but yield to them; to yield to transformation while mourning it is profound indeed. Does one seek the reputation of near-benevolence? Those who claim the office of life to replace Heaven in giving life—just as they replace Heaven in killing—are fools. The sage never acts the fool, and thus appears unworthy.\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—thus they hunger. The people’s unruliness comes from their superiors’ meddling—thus they are unruly. The people’s disregard for death comes from their superiors’ lavish pursuit of life—thus they disregard death. Only one who takes no thought for life excels those who prize it.\n\nChapter Seventy-Five\nThose who consume taxes are the superiors; those who hunger are the people. Those who meddle are the superiors; those who are unruly are the people. Though they do not know one another, they depend on each other—this is indeed so. To govern our lives while desiring to preserve them is no different from raising livestock. Who knows that though they do not know one another, they depend on each other? Are liver and gallbladder as distant as the northern Hu and southern Yue?\n\nThus, if you equate their differences, then liver and gallbladder become Hu and Yue; if you distinguish their sameness, then liver and gallbladder become Hu and Yue. In that there is this, in this there is that; that and this complete each other, and life and death do not contradict. How can all be so lavishly valued that none know what is slight? If one subtly makes them aware, then sinews, bones, blood, and flesh all become hollow, while emptiness and nothingness become full.\n\nThus it is said: “Empty yet used, it is never filled.” Truly, it is never filled—knowing how to enter without obstruction, why would one prize life so heavily and treat death so lightly?\n\nChapter Seventy-Six\nWhen people are alive, they are supple and weak; when dead, they are stiff and strong. When plants and trees are alive, they are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus, the stiff and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life. Therefore, when armies grow strong, they perish; when trees grow strong, they are felled. Dong Sijing said: “People unite to attack what is strong and great; the lowly and weak remain above.”\n\nStrength and weakness are but traces. How could a tree desire life and thus deliberately remain soft and fragile? When the celestial fluid does not reach it and only dregs remain, the form of stiffness and withering takes shape. Thus, stiffness and strength are accumulations of being; suppleness and weakness are transformations of non-being. If the transformation of non-being is still sufficient for life, how much more so what has not yet transformed? When forced to employ this transformation to remain supple and weak, it is because it has not strayed far from non-being. Without that strength, the supple would not congeal—this is how the world thickly cultivates its substance. Yet who knows that congealing is already the companion of death? Though substance is firmly established and cannot be without, when it employs the emptiness of Heaven and Earth to rise and fall, then not only is what remains above supple and weak, but even what lies below is far from withered and dry.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow: what is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted; what is excessive is reduced, what is insufficient is supplemented. The Way of Heaven reduces excess to supplement insufficiency. The way of man is not so—it reduces insufficiency to serve excess. Who can have excess to offer the world? Only one with the Dao. Thus, the sage acts without relying, accomplishes without dwelling, and does not wish to display worth.\n\nChapter Seventy-Seven\nOnly when a bow has “high” and “low” can one apply “pressing down” and “lifting up.” Only when people have “excess” and “insufficiency” can Heaven apply “reducing” and “supplementing.” Those who reduce themselves certainly do not lack reduction, but those who receive Heaven’s reduction suffer dire misfortune. The sage’s ability to avoid Heaven’s misfortune lies in not bringing misfortune upon the earth. How could only those who labor the world to serve themselves be serving excess? People are not yet unworthy yet desire to be worthy; they are not yet chaotic yet desire to govern. When fine reputations come their way and foul rumors are bestowed as gifts, is this not delighting in the world’s failure to perfect oneself? Thus, when one person rests securely in position, the world loses its footing; when one day’s will is carried out, a hundred men grieve. The impulse to kill arises from proclamations and oaths, and warhorses are born from merit and fame. Then how can the common man’s frugal self-service and the worthy man’s lavish self-service not be feared?\n\nNothing in the world is weaker than water, yet nothing can overcome what is hard and strong—nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard, none in the world do not know, yet none can practice it. Thus, the sage says: “Receiving the world’s filth, one is called lord of the altars of soil and grain; receiving the world’s misfortune, one is called king of all under Heaven.” Straightforward words seem contradictory.\n\nChapter Seventy-Eight\n\nWithout the power to \"attack,\" yet harboring the intent to \"attack,\" the mind stirs its power. Without the intent to \"attack,\" yet possessing the power to \"attack,\" the power unsettles the mind. When mind and power are both sufficient for \"attack,\" each vies for dominance, and within the self, each clutches its spear and halberd, ever shifting. Yet to seek to \"attack\" all under Heaven—none have succeeded without crumbling.\n\nNevertheless, nothing is more perilous than the mind. Now, does water ever desire to oppose the hard and strong as an attacker? It bears the world’s \"filth,\" yet through all ages, its intent remains unchanged, and its power follows. Why? Water’s lack of power is equal to its lack of intent; water’s lack of intent is equal to its lack of power.\n\nThus, one who \"weakens their will\" has no \"changing will\"; one who \"empties their mind\" has no \"changing mind.\" Acting only where unavoidable, unaware of hardness or strength, peril or ease give no cause for altered concern—nothing more, than lodging the mind in boundlessness while inwardly free from self-entanglement. Lodging the mind in boundlessness, nothing is feared. Inwardly free from self-entanglement, harmony is perfected.\n\nHarmony within, fearlessness without—who under Heaven can withstand it?\n\nTo reconcile great resentment, residual resentment must remain.\n\nTo repay resentment with virtue—how can this be deemed good? Thus the sage holds the left tally, yet makes no demand upon others. [The left tally is what the debtor holds to account for what is owed, merely awaiting the creditor’s claim.] One with virtue oversees the tally; one without virtue enforces uniformity. [Uniformity means to penetrate and equalize all things.] The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it ever accords with the good.\n\n[Li Xizhai says: It, too, merely oversees the tally.]\n\nChapter Seventy-Nine\n\nSince one does not wish to attack, one then “harmonizes” with it. For those who would act in the world, there is no other path but these two. Things are fundamentally equal—what need is there for me to penetrate them? If things are not penetrated, how then can I equalize them? Without intent, without power, resentment naturally does not grow. Those with intent find their minds settled and released; those with power find their strength exhausted and turn back. Not waiting for them to come to me at their wits’ end, but instead hastening to meet them with the virtue of equalizing and penetrating—this only deepens their resentment, and the resentment returns to me.\n\nThe sage, knowing this, sits and dissolves the shifts of yin and yang’s excesses and deficiencies, and Heaven naturally settles itself.

      "translated_text": "**Wang Fuzhi’s *Expounding the Laozi*: Preface**\n\nThose who annotated the *Laozi* in former times belonged to different schools, each transmitting divergent interpretations. By the time of Wang Bi and He Yan, they conflated it with the *Book of Changes*’ principles of qian and kun, simplicity and ease; Kumārajīva and Emperor Wu of Liang diluted it with the Buddhist doctrines of cause and effect in affairs and principles. Such forced patchwork and arbitrary synthesis have long been distortions. Down to Lu Xisheng, Su Ziyou, Dong Sijing, and more recently Jiao Hong and Li Zhi, they increasingly drew from Chan Buddhism, stitching it together with Laozi’s teachings, blending what they called \"a special transmission outside the teachings.\" This is like the people of Min mistaking frost for snow, or those of Luo peeling a *pengqi* upon hearing of eating crabs.\n\nLaozi himself said: \"Carry your *po* and embrace the One without separation,\" \"The great Dao overflows, drifting left or right,\" and \"Use the harmonizing *qi* of the void.\" These are Laozi’s own explanations. Zhuangzi said: \"Do good without seeking fame, do evil without courting punishment, follow the central path as your constant.\" This is Zhuangzi’s elucidation of Laozi.\n\nTo abandon these clear expositions and forcibly align Confucianism with the Dao is to slander the Confucians; to forcibly align the Dao with Buddhism is to slander the Dao. Such interpreters drive worldly teachings to serve their own doctrines of \"turning away from dust and merging consciousness,\" becoming pests that endure. How can this be tolerated?\n\nHaving long examined these distortions, I now set aside all previous schools to expound Laozi’s meaning. It is like entering their fortress, seizing their supplies, exposing their defenses, and revealing their flaws. Only by seeing their flaws can the Dao be restored.\n\nWhat, then, are these flaws? Those who discourse on the Dao often provoke the vulgar by deliberately opposing them—this is unjust; they seize upon partial insights and cling to them—this is unprincipled; they hack at wisdom and flaunt it—this is inauspicious. Laozi’s teachings suffer from all three errors. Thus, compared to the sagely Dao, which is adorned with ritual and music to establish the ultimate of central harmony, Laozi’s depth is insufficient.\n\nNevertheless, as the world shifts and the Dao is lost, collapse and ruin follow in quick succession. Those who cling to texts drift into hypocrisy and theft; those who obscure the subtle portents become harbingers of disaster. Rulers who govern the world stir up trouble to exhaust the people; those who seize the world deplete their strength and wisdom to ruin their subjects. If we probe Laozi’s subtleties to await the Dao’s self-restoration, there is still hope. The rise of Emperors Wen and Jing led to lasting peace; Zhang Zifang and Sun Zhonghe, though differing in their pursuits, averted peril. Such is the use of this teaching. Compared to Buddhism’s desolate harshness, which ultimately leads to entanglement in thorns, recklessly discarding the principles of things to seek fleeting marvels, is this not the wiser path?\n\nSima Qian said: \"Laozi practiced non-action and transformed naturally; he purified himself and rectified naturally.\" This is close to the truth. As for the \"like a dragon\" praise attributed to Confucius’ disciples, what value does it hold?\n\nWritten in the year *zhanmeng xieqia*, the eighth month, day *yiwei*, by Wang Fuzhi of Nanyue.\n\n**Chapter One**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\n*[The eternal Dao is without Dao.]*\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\n*[The eternal name is without name.]*\nThe nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth;\n*[All names arise from it, yet it cannot be named by any single name.]*\nThe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.\n*[Names are established by things, and names in turn generate things.]*\nThus, in constant non-being, one observes its mystery;\nIn constant being, one observes its manifestations.\n*[Its boundaries.]*\nThese two emerge together but differ in name.\n*[Different observations of the same constant: whether with desire or without, one does not divide the mind to respond. Abiding in the center and holding to the constant, one naturally attains the observation of mystery and manifestation.]*\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and again profound—\nThe gate of all mysteries.\n\n**Commentary on Chapter One**\n\nWhat is \"can be\" is not \"eternal\"; what is \"eternal\" has no \"can be.\" Yet if we rely on the \"eternal,\" then the \"eternal\" is one \"can be.\" Thus, the \"eternal\" is not abandoned, yet there is nothing that \"can be.\" By not abandoning the \"eternal,\" human mechanisms are connected; by having nothing that \"can be,\" the harmony of heaven is unified.\n\nSince there is already a \"beginning\" and a \"mother,\" I casually \"observe\" them. To \"observe\" is to ride upon their inevitability. Observing their \"difference,\" there are countless transformations; observing their \"sameness,\" what exists arises later, and what is non-existent is not the great beginning. Thus, those who respond by going forth see difference; those who abide and await see sameness.\n\nTherefore, one consumes the ten thousand things without claiming benevolence; one enters the realm of artifice without encountering its sharpness. Knowing the world’s conditions, one does not force others to serve oneself; discarding one’s own excess, one does not cling to the old to confuse the new.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, none can name its achievement, yet we style it \"the host of mysteries\"—for in dwelling within the grasp of meaning, opening the gate to traverse the hundred transformations of life and death, how fitting it is!\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises. Being and non-being give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low fill each other; sound and voice harmonize each other; front and back follow each other. These are the eternal knowables of all under heaven. Therefore, the sage abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words. [It is not that he does not allow all under heaven to know, but rather that he follows what cannot be known.] The ten thousand things arise yet he does not initiate; they live yet he does not possess; he acts yet does not rely; achievements are completed yet he does not dwell. Only because he does not dwell, they do not depart.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nThough the changes of all under heaven are myriad, they ultimately return to two ends. These two ends arise from one source—thus, when there is \"beauty,\" there is also \"ugliness\"; when there is \"goodness,\" there is also \"not-goodness.\" If one clings to the one to encompass the other’s non-unity, then black and white contend, and praise and blame intermingle. The sage’s \"embracing of the One\" lies in this: when the one and the other become two, he slowly abides in the center. Thus, when that one and this one stand as fortresses, he knows their foundation is without fortress—then sits and gathers them in. The fortress-builder \"dwells,\" while the one who sits and gathers \"does not depart.\" This is called skillful contention.\n\nDo not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend. Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal. Do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be confused. Therefore, in the sage’s governance, he empties their hearts [using the useless to employ the without], fills their bellies [using the useful to employ the with], weakens their ambitions [entering the ten thousand things with skill], and strengthens their bones [planting them to await]. He constantly ensures the people are without knowledge and without desire. He causes the wise not to dare act. By acting through non-action, there is nothing left ungoverned.\n\n**Chapter Three**\nContention does not necessarily arise from \"worthiness\"; theft does not necessarily stem from \"rare goods\"; the heart is not necessarily \"confused\" by \"seeing what is desirable.\" The ten thousand things lie in clumps, and delusive dreams arise—when my spirit and form cannot balance themselves, then wood grates against wood to generate heat, water clashes with water to produce bubbles. Yet if one governs them with this, their generation never ceases. Thus, the yang fire advances, and the position it has advanced to, now empty, summons yin. The yin tally retreats, and what it has retreated from drifts to encroach upon yang. Is there not always its opposite?\n\nThe \"empty\" returns to the \"heart,\" the \"full\" returns to the \"belly,\" the \"weak\" returns to the \"ambition,\" the \"strong\" returns to the \"bones\"—these four numbers each have their return and find their joyous land. Then, without my going, governance is achieved. Who is the master that causes their return? And who holds their mandate at what time?",

      "translated_text": "Can this reveal the nature of contention? Those who do not understand take no part in it. Thus, the sage inwardly uses it to purify the self and outwardly to govern the world.\n\nThe Dao is empty—*chong* (in ancient texts, *zhong*, the hollow within a vessel)—yet its use is never full. *It does not seek fullness, hence its \"or\"*—abyssal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts their sharpness, unravels their tangles; harmonizes their radiance, equalizes their dust. *Yang employs sharpness and embodies light; yin employs tangles and embodies dust.* Profound, it seems to endure. I know not whose child it is—it appears before the image of the Lord.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nAll use tends toward fullness, yet only *\"empty and used, it is never full\"*! Its operation as a principle emerges from \"tangles\" and \"dust,\" enters into \"sharpness\" and \"light\"; emerges from \"sharpness\" and \"light,\" enters into \"tangles\" and \"dust.\" Only the empty can be sharp, can be bright, can be tangled, can be dust—receiving the return of these four yet retaining none. Thus, when fierce qi comes to contend, a cold heart retreats to its place. Though there be a proud son, he cannot betray his ancestor; though there be a grand emperor, he cannot surpass his predecessor. Does it ever covet their sacrificial vessels or compete in their steps? It resembles and mirrors them, taking its name from things that cannot defy it.\n\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent—he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs. The space between heaven and earth—is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, *only when exhausted does benevolence arise* the more it moves, the more it issues forth. Having issued, it must reach its limit. Much speech hastens exhaustion—benevolence must speak, yet it is better to guard the center.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nWind arises from emptiness; the bellows awaits the drum—each requires the other to function, yet the vessel itself is not the use. Thus, sounds in unison need not respond, and qi in harmony need not seek. Therefore, heaven cannot give birth, earth cannot complete—heaven and earth cannot claim sole mastery, how much less the myriad things? How much less the sage? What is established in them is merely *\"empty yet inexhaustible.\"* The Dao seams through their midst, so that fish may be made to fly and birds to swim—benevolence is insufficient to resemble it. Benevolence is heaven’s qi, earth’s nourishment, the work of finite ends.\n\nThe valley spirit does not die—*Lu Jifu says: \"Form and formless unite and do not die\"*—this is called the mysterious female. *Lu Jifu says: \"The body unites with the heart, the heart with qi, qi with spirit, spirit with nothingness—united, it does not die; not dying, it does not arise; not arising, it can give rise to life\"*—the gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.

      "translated_text": "When the fetus grows strong, the mother becomes weak; when the grain ripens, the stalk is harvested—few doubt that heaven and earth too grow weak and are harvested. Yet heaven and earth cannot but feed upon the myriad things, though they never feed for the sake of feeding. Each embryo has its origin, each root its bud; they roam within the void, yet ultimately draw sustenance from what is their own.\n\nThe sage does not expose himself to peril—thus he comes last; does not place himself at the center—thus he remains outside. He feeds upon the myriad things yet shows no favor; is fed upon by the myriad things, yet they bear no resentment. Thus, without exerting effort, his merit seeps into the barren soil; without awaiting the ear, his virtue spreads through the generations. And so he matches the enduring constancy of heaven and earth.\n\n**Highest virtue resembles water.**\nWater benefits the myriad things yet contends with none, dwelling where the multitude shun—*for men prefer the high and disdain the low*—thus it comes near the Dao.\nIt abides in good earth, its heart in deep stillness; it befriends with true kindness, speaks with trustworthiness, governs with good order, acts with skill, moves in timely accord. *Not clinging to its goodness, it is truly good.* Only by not contending does it remain free from blame.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\n\nThe five phases in their essence—water is the most subtle. Those who dwell well in the Dao value its subtlety, not its conspicuousness; they stay behind the multitude yet always precede them. Why? While others shun what is low, they arrive early without notice. Calculating in reverse, they gather slowly through non-contention—what loss is there for others to dispute? And what blame could fall upon them? If the multitude could recognize the goodness in what they despise, they too would rush to claim it. Yet human nature ensures this never comes to pass, so the sage monopolizes the advantage.\n\nHold and fill it—*hold it to make it full*—better to desist. Temper and sharpen it—*temper it to make it keen*—it cannot long endure. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them; *rightly, one guards them by not guarding.* Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall. To withdraw once merit is achieved—this is the Dao of heaven.\n\n**Chapter Nine**",

That heaven and earth can endure and persist is because they do not live for themselves, do not give life to themselves—thus they attain long life. Things grow together with them, so the sage places himself last and finds himself first; sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is selfless? Therefore he fulfills his self. **Chapter Seven**",

      "translated_text": "Good conduct does not tread upon solid ground, good speech does not cling to beauty. Good calculation requires no counting rods; counting rods achieve the small but forget the great. Good closure needs no bolt nor bar yet cannot be opened—Lu Jifu says: \"If I do not open, who can open it?\" Good binding needs no cord nor knot yet cannot be undone—no attachment, no separation, like a mother to her child.\n\nThus the sage is ever good at saving people, and so discards no one; ever good at saving things, and so discards nothing. This is called inheriting clarity.\n\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good; the not-good person is the resource of the good. If one does not value one’s teacher nor cherish one’s resource, though wise, one is greatly deluded. This is called the essential mystery.\n\nChapter Twenty-Seven\nMy possession of clarity is not clarity—how much less to cast clarity upon things and measure their lengths and shorts to make them shine? Thus birds are trapped by fullness, earthworms confined by emptiness, fish stranded on dry land—each secures its capture yet does not know that what seems not to be gained can be gain. If I wish to overcome them, I do not go forth to measure them.\n\nAll things adorn their forms to seek one another, or flee their beauty to provoke one another; all secretly probe their roots, conceal and possess them—then things come to me, and I do not go to things. The many full seek supply, but the one empty has no gaps. Thus the intentions of good and evil vanish, and what speech and conduct enclose and bind is an essential mystery beyond fathoming.\n\nKnow the masculine, keep to the feminine—Lu Jifu says: \"Harmonious yet not leading\"—become the world’s stream. As the world’s stream, constant virtue does not depart, returning to infancy. Know the white, keep to the black, become the world’s model. As the world’s model, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless. Know glory, keep to disgrace, become the world’s valley. As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to uncarved simplicity.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; the sage employs it and becomes the chief of officials—using what has not yet scattered. Thus great wisdom does not sever.\n\nChapter Twenty-Eight\nWhether feminine or masculine, white or black, glory or disgrace, each has its counterpart and cannot intermingle. Then my Dao is nearly exhausted, and my knowing and keeping are no longer one. The knowing return to clarity, the keeping return to turbidity; the two arts divide, each returning to its likeness. One who roams the circle’s center may know this.\n\nYet if one devotes intent to knowing but achieves success through keeping, why is this? The guest is clarity, the host is turbidity—by the necessity of things reaching their extreme and turning back, what turns back can long be the host. Thus infancy can mature, but maturity cannot return to infancy; the boundless can become bounded, but the bounded cannot become boundless; simplicity can be carved, but carving cannot return to simplicity.\n\nYet the sage does not meticulously distinguish between what can and cannot be. Roaming the circle’s center, like a soaking rain upon an anthill, like a prairie fire scorching a thicket—without beginning or end, most solid and most empty—establishing order so that clarity and turbidity each return to their abodes, resplendently enacting great regulation.\n\nThough compelled to seek its use, then the feminine, the black, the disgraceful—grasp their power to age the world’s vessels.\n\nChapter Twenty-Nine\nThose who would take the world and act upon it, I see they do not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel—though it is a vessel, the sacred constantly flows through it—it cannot be acted upon, cannot be grasped. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\n\nThus the sage practices non-action, and so does not ruin; does not grasp, and so does not lose. For things sometimes lead, sometimes follow; sometimes exhale, sometimes inhale; sometimes are strong, sometimes weak; sometimes are upheld, sometimes overthrown. All is as the sacred makes it so.\n\nTherefore the sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes excessiveness.\n\nThe world is within me—what do I take? I am within the world—what do I do? The world is like me—what do I desire? I am like the world—what do I grasp? Measuring the world by myself, the world is sacred. Encountering myself with the world, the world is not sacred. Those who are not sacred make it sacred, and the world is disordered. Those who are sacred make it not sacred, and I am at peace.\n\nThus exhausting the world with the eight reckonings and removing my three deaths, then raging fire may burn the forest yet one can await its cold, vast floods may drown the heavens yet one can watch them dry. Water and fire lose their power, metal and stone forsake their steadfastness—how much more those with feelings who must be exhausted and those with qi who must contract?\n\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use arms to strengthen the world.",

      "translated_text": "The matter favors remoteness. Where the army dwells, brambles grow. In the wake of great armies, lean years must follow. Goodness achieves its end and no more—it does not seize strength. Having achieved, do not boast; having achieved, do not vaunt; having achieved, do not grow arrogant. Achievement comes only when there is no other choice; having achieved, do not force it. Even in times when arms must be used, when calamity arises and victory is certain, one should still hold these five principles in mind.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called not following the Dao. What does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\n[Chapter 30]\nThose who employ arms at the lowest level do so to kill; at the highest, to preserve life. Yet even those who use life to sustain life are superfluous—how much more those who use killing to sustain life? People are never without life—why then should I urge them? Moreover, the gate of merit is the mansion of harm. People are never without life, yet one cannot rely on their living; things are never without death, yet one cannot depend on their dying. A moment’s failure of restraint, and one calls oneself resolute—is this not delusion?\n\nThus, those who are skilled at restraining violence wait for its dissipation rather than crushing its breath; those who are skilled at governing the passions block their growth rather than forcing their decline; those who value life hold to the balance between growth and decline, without trespassing against their critical juncture.

The noble person at rest values the left, but in warfare values the right. War is an inauspicious instrument, not the instrument of the noble person; when compelled to use it, one should do so with utmost restraint. To triumph is not to be celebrated; those who celebrate it delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their will in the world.\n\nAuspicious affairs honor the left, while inauspicious affairs honor the right. The deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right—this is to treat war as a funeral rite. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with funeral rites.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nBetter to forget it beforehand than to lament it afterward; better to dwell in the realm of no merit through auspicious means than to claim merit through inauspicious rites.

The one who does not lose their place endures. The one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\n\n[Wealth does not necessarily entail resolve, and resolve cannot be equated with wealth. Endurance has its limits, but longevity knows no end.]\n\nTo use qi to supplement qi, essence to supplement essence, and claim \"I do not lose my place\"—yet in the end, all return to decay. How is this different from Shan Bao, who perished externally, or Zhang Yi, who perished internally? For those who scheme with cunning and exert force to pursue their ambitions, clinging to a \"place\" yet unable to follow the natural \"place\" of no loss—such is their fate. To see that one’s essence and qi are not in excess may be called death, yet that which remains within—gentle as a maiden, flowing like clouds, subtle and mysteriously penetrating—has never perished. Without truly employing this subtle clarity, bending and stretching within the ultimate harmony of the Dao, as if embracing it without parting, how could one partake in this?\n\nThus, the laws of Youyu endured, but the Way of Tai Shi was long-lived. The calculations of mediocre scholars may stretch long, but the life of those who embody the Dao knows no bounds.

Because it never asserts its own greatness, [it may be named yet does not act—this is why it never acts as such] it accomplishes its greatness.\n\nWho can claim to repay heaven and earth with life, only to resent them in death? Heaven and earth engage with things in constant exchange, merely prolonging their own existence. If even heaven and earth are thus, how much more so the Dao? Vast and boundless, without borders; flowing and interconnected, with means to communicate. Thus, east and west have no fixed direction, achievements and fame bear no attachment, host and guest have no fixed roles, one’s own life is valued yet the lives of things are not opposed. Truly, if one does not perceive what is desirable, it is not because desire is blocked; if one alternates in the role of master, it is not because one refuses mastery.

      "translated_text": "Movement both departing and arriving—this is called reversion. The qi-mechanism of transformation in things, all possessing departure and arrival, originates in the Dao’s flowing vastness, its ceaseless shifting, exhalation and inhalation, its subtlety in non-stasis.\n\nWeakness is the function of the Dao. Firmness and strength rely on support and thus lose their function—this is not the Dao. The function of the Dao lies solely in movement through weakness.\n\nThe ten thousand things under heaven are born from Being, and Being is born from Non-being. When the Dao rests in Non-being, is this not reversion? That which ascends—is it not movement? As Zhao Zhijian says: Though things have not yet taken form, their qi already exists. Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things arise from the One Qi, and the One Qi arises from the Dao.\n\nChapter Forty:\nFlowing, it may fill; full, it may halt—then it dies and becomes a vessel. People know the vessel’s utility but do not know it died in becoming a vessel. As for the Dao, it embraces the ten thousand things and enters the ten thousand things, now departing, now arriving, now arriving, now departing, coiling and subtle, never exhausted. When it presses forward and arrives, there is Being; when it draws back and departs, it entrusts itself to Non-being to generate Being, and thus may be named Non-being. Therefore, observing it through its reversion, one may perceive it directly.\n\nIts child is light, its grandchild is water—truly, to embody its function is difficult. To force arrival with strength, to halt departure with weakness, to bring forth function through movement, is to cling to robust existence and obstruct the qi-mechanism of life’s departure and arrival. Thus, function always lies in weakness, and only then can the Dao be employed.\n\nThe arising of movement is the work of Heaven. The arising of function is the work of humans. Heaven models itself on the Dao, humans model themselves on Heaven—what place is there for force? Yet those who know the fundamental movement of the Dao’s body are few. Only by knowing movement does one know reversion; by knowing reversion does one know weakness.\n\nThe highest scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it. The middling scholar, hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt. The lowest scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs loudly at it. Without such laughter, it would not suffice as the Dao. Thus, established sayings declare:\n\nThe luminous Dao seems obscure;\nThe advancing Dao seems to retreat;\nThe level Dao seems uneven;\nHighest virtue resembles a valley;\nVast virtue seems insufficient;\nEstablished virtue seems lax;\nTrue substance seems to change;\nGreat purity seems sullied;\nGreat squares have no corners;\nGreat vessels take long to complete;\nGreat sounds are scarcely heard;\nGreat images have no form.\n\nAs Lü Jifu says: Sinking into petty measures, one returns to great penetration.",

Then yin dies in turbidity, yang dies in purity—how can one even faintly resemble the so-called \"harmony\"? How much less attain the harmony that transcends harmony?\n\nReflecting on this, one then understands that ceaselessly preserving the minimal, diminishing the minimal to achieve \"harmony,\" and diminishing \"harmony\" to attain the \"One.\" Yet those who attain the \"One\" possess no \"One,\" and those who achieve \"harmony\" make no achievement. Dispersing their factions, wandering their courts, yin and yang reside within me yet do not betray their origin—then the greatest \"increase\" is achieved, what more could be added?]\n\nThe softest in the world gallops through the hardest. Non-being enters where there is no gap; thus I know the benefit of non-action. Teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain this.\n\nForty-Third Chapter\n[Those who rush north to reach Yan, those who race south to reach Yue—yet the chariot with no destination always finds level ground without obstruction, traversing all things without resistance. One who unties with an awl cannot undo an untangled knot; one who splits with an axe cannot cleave unsplit firewood. If one knows that the solid contains the hollow and thus follows it, then no matter how myriad the changes, my will is never thwarted. Those who flaunt their \"hardness\" and prepare defenses, or measure gaps to exploit fissures, are many—this is why the Dao ultimately withdraws into the \"nameable.\"]\n\nWhich is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Excessive love incurs great cost; hoarding leads to heavy loss. Thus, knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. [Xue Juncai says: Delighting in what one already has is enough—why seek further disgrace? Fearing future loss, one knows the peril of excess.] This is how one endures long.\n\nForty-Four Chapter\n[What is called the \"perfected person\" is not one who distances themselves from things to live in isolation, sitting idly to watch changes, knowing that in the end, I cannot control things, nor can things control me. Thus, disgrace has its origins, yet disgrace may come without cause; danger summons itself, yet danger may arrive uninvited. However, if one hastily seizes misfortune to accept a \"name,\" it would be better to remain without attachment. Therefore, one is said to skillfully cherish \"name\" and skillfully dwell in \"wealth,\" skillfully embrace \"gain\" and skillfully relinquish \"loss.\"\n\n\"Gain\" for the self quietly dissolves the disharmony of yin and yang; \"gain\" for the world disperses the ferocity of tigers and rhinos.]\n\nGreat accomplishment seems incomplete, yet its use is inexhaustible. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless. Great straightness seems bent, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems inarticulate. Cold overcomes restlessness; stillness overcomes heat. [Sheng reads as \"overcome.\" Ye Mengde says: Knowing what overcomes, what can one not achieve?] Purity and stillness govern the world. [When the world is governed, it governs itself. If one seeks to govern the world, one only increases its cold and heat.]\n\nForty-Fifth Chapter\n[When yin and yang interact, human affairs become complicated; when human affairs complicate, achievements and fame become prominent. Thus, those who delight in action are drawn to what is full and flock to it. Yet when one attaches to what is already full, it must diminish oneself, leading to the desire to overcome it. I see them shivering in the cold and rushing to the fire, or sweltering in heat and drinking ice—only to exhaust themselves. Do they enjoy such suffering? Initially, they followed what was easy to seek fullness, unaware it would come to this. But if one conserves early, remains unmoved by things, then yin and yang grow naturally, without attachment to achievements or fame. Beginning without dependence, ending without competition, the world is governed, yet I seem to have done nothing. Thus, in appearance, one seems lacking, yet in reality, enjoys abundance. Truly enjoying it, why worry about appearances?]\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields. When the world loses the Dao, warhorses breed in the suburbs. No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment; no fault is greater than the desire for gain. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is always sufficient.\n\nForty-Sixth Chapter\n[Disaster arises from the heart’s core, while fortune hides in namelessness. A single trigger’s movement is like an ant’s burrow, yet the clash of myriad killings is like a river’s breach. Therefore, those who follow the Dao do not seek fortune first, and the world knows no disaster. Is this due to forced restraint? Understanding the excesses and harms of yin and yang, delighting in wandering the garden of great harmony—how could one, with one’s limited knowledge, transgress what must harm others?]",

Thus, those who \"govern with uprightness\" seek to quell arms, yet arms arise all the more. The \"skilled warrior\" may deploy troops, yet no harm is done.

      "translated_text": "The people’s hunger comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—thus they hunger. The people’s unruliness comes from their superiors’ meddling—thus they are unruly. The people’s disregard for death comes from their superiors’ lavish pursuit of life—thus they disregard death. Only one who takes no thought for life excels those who prize it.\n\nChapter Seventy-Five\nThose who consume taxes are the superiors; those who hunger are the people. Those who meddle are the superiors; those who are unruly are the people. Though they do not know one another, they depend on each other—this is indeed so. To govern our lives while desiring to preserve them is no different from raising livestock. Who knows that though they do not know one another, they depend on each other? Are liver and gallbladder as distant as the northern Hu and southern Yue?\n\nThus, if you equate their differences, then liver and gallbladder become Hu and Yue; if you distinguish their sameness, then liver and gallbladder become Hu and Yue. In that there is this, in this there is that; that and this complete each other, and life and death do not contradict. How can all be so lavishly valued that none know what is slight? If one subtly makes them aware, then sinews, bones, blood, and flesh all become hollow, while emptiness and nothingness become full.\n\nThus it is said: “Empty yet used, it is never filled.” Truly, it is never filled—knowing how to enter without obstruction, why would one prize life so heavily and treat death so lightly?\n\nChapter Seventy-Six\nWhen people are alive, they are supple and weak; when dead, they are stiff and strong. When plants and trees are alive, they are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus, the stiff and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life. Therefore, when armies grow strong, they perish; when trees grow strong, they are felled. Dong Sijing said: “People unite to attack what is strong and great; the lowly and weak remain above.”\n\nStrength and weakness are but traces. How could a tree desire life and thus deliberately remain soft and fragile? When the celestial fluid does not reach it and only dregs remain, the form of stiffness and withering takes shape. Thus, stiffness and strength are accumulations of being; suppleness and weakness are transformations of non-being. If the transformation of non-being is still sufficient for life, how much more so what has not yet transformed? When forced to employ this transformation to remain supple and weak, it is because it has not strayed far from non-being. Without that strength, the supple would not congeal—this is how the world thickly cultivates its substance. Yet who knows that congealing is already the companion of death? Though substance is firmly established and cannot be without, when it employs the emptiness of Heaven and Earth to rise and fall, then not only is what remains above supple and weak, but even what lies below is far from withered and dry.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow: what is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted; what is excessive is reduced, what is insufficient is supplemented. The Way of Heaven reduces excess to supplement insufficiency. The way of man is not so—it reduces insufficiency to serve excess. Who can have excess to offer the world? Only one with the Dao. Thus, the sage acts without relying, accomplishes without dwelling, and does not wish to display worth.\n\nChapter Seventy-Seven\nOnly when a bow has “high” and “low” can one apply “pressing down” and “lifting up.” Only when people have “excess” and “insufficiency” can Heaven apply “reducing” and “supplementing.” Those who reduce themselves certainly do not lack reduction, but those who receive Heaven’s reduction suffer dire misfortune. The sage’s ability to avoid Heaven’s misfortune lies in not bringing misfortune upon the earth. How could only those who labor the world to serve themselves be serving excess? People are not yet unworthy yet desire to be worthy; they are not yet chaotic yet desire to govern. When fine reputations come their way and foul rumors are bestowed as gifts, is this not delighting in the world’s failure to perfect oneself? Thus, when one person rests securely in position, the world loses its footing; when one day’s will is carried out, a hundred men grieve. The impulse to kill arises from proclamations and oaths, and warhorses are born from merit and fame. Then how can the common man’s frugal self-service and the worthy man’s lavish self-service not be feared?\n\nNothing in the world is weaker than water, yet nothing can overcome what is hard and strong—nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard, none in the world do not know, yet none can practice it. Thus, the sage says: “Receiving the world’s filth, one is called lord of the altars of soil and grain; receiving the world’s misfortune, one is called king of all under Heaven.” Straightforward words seem contradictory.\n\nChapter Seventy-Eight",

Without the intent to \"attack,\" yet possessing the power to \"attack,\" the power unsettles the mind. When mind and power are both sufficient for \"attack,\" each vies for dominance, and within the self, each clutches its spear and halberd, ever shifting. Yet to seek to \"attack\" all under Heaven—none have succeeded without crumbling.\n\nNevertheless, nothing is more perilous than the mind. Now, does water ever desire to oppose the hard and strong as an attacker? It bears the world’s \"filth,\" yet through all ages, its intent remains unchanged, and its power follows. Why? Water’s lack of power is equal to its lack of intent; water’s lack of intent is equal to its lack of power.\n\nThus, one who \"weakens their will\" has no \"changing will\"; one who \"empties their mind\" has no \"changing mind.\" Acting only where unavoidable, unaware of hardness or strength, peril or ease give no cause for altered concern—nothing more, than lodging the mind in boundlessness while inwardly free from self-entanglement. Lodging the mind in boundlessness, nothing is feared.

      "translated_text": "To repay resentment with virtue—how can this be deemed good? Thus the sage holds the left tally, yet makes no demand upon others. [The left tally is what the debtor holds to account for what is owed, merely awaiting the creditor’s claim.] One with virtue oversees the tally; one without virtue enforces uniformity. [Uniformity means to penetrate and equalize all things.] The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it ever accords with the good.\n\n[Li Xizhai says: It, too, merely oversees the tally.]\n\nChapter Seventy-Nine\n\nSince one does not wish to attack, one then “harmonizes” with it. For those who would act in the world, there is no other path but these two. Things are fundamentally equal—what need is there for me to penetrate them? If things are not penetrated, how then can I equalize them? Without intent, without power, resentment naturally does not grow. Those with intent find their minds settled and released; those with power find their strength exhausted and turn back. Not waiting for them to come to me at their wits’ end, but instead hastening to meet them with the virtue of equalizing and penetrating—this only deepens their resentment, and the resentment returns to me.\n\nThe sage, knowing this, sits and dissolves the shifts of yin and yang’s excesses and deficiencies, and Heaven naturally settles itself. The oppositions of stillness and motion, cold and heat, he sits and overcomes, and the body naturally finds peace. The disputes of Confucians and Mohists, right and wrong, he sits and illuminates, and the Dao naturally unifies itself.
