Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, Dunxuan Section, *Weiyi* (Ritual Etiquette) Category.\n\n**Yellow Talisman Ten Invocations Rite – Ritual Procedure**\n\nWith reverence, we acknowledge that heaven covers and earth bears, secretly operating the vital mechanisms of life and transformation; as days pass and months turn, all are subject to the waxing and waning of light. Yet even as spring blooms and autumn fades, as yang breathes and yin dissipates, none can escape the appointed time of change, nor avoid the cycle of rebirth. How much more so for humanity—bound to the Three Realms, inheriting the Five Constants—whose life is as fleeting as the flash of a spark or the flicker of lightning. Unless one attains the Dao, how may one abide in the eternal?\n\nNow, though this departed one had no grave transgressions, their nature was pure and harmonious, their heart inclined toward the highest virtue. They vainly wished for the longevity of the *chun* and *song* trees, or the endurance of metal and stone. Yet the Three Pengs and Two Jians hasten their decline, and the Four Great Elements and hundred limbs cannot halt their passage. Thus, separation is bitter, and longing brings sorrow. Grieving the depth of posthumous bonds, they weigh heavily upon the weight of prior obligations.\n\nTherefore, we solemnly assemble this sacred gathering, devoutly preparing precious offerings, invoking the lofty immortals of the Three Realms and proclaiming the Ten Radiant Titles. May their spirit and soul remain unobscured, as if alive. Freed from worldly ties, they now reverently listen to the Dao.\n\n**The Assembly Recites the Ten Invocations in Order**\n\n*First Invocation:*\nProclaim to the departed soul: \"I take refuge in the supreme Dao Treasure, the Ten-Directional Great Saints, the Three Supreme Sovereigns. Countless kalpas have they liberated beings; before heaven’s establishment, they founded the teaching. Their boundless compassion extends to all life, and their radiant forms manifest in myriad transformations. As shadows follow sound and responses align with intent, their blessings are boundless in this world and the next. Thus, in this life and all future existences, one must always hold them in faith and reverence.\"\n\n*Second Invocation:*\nProclaim to the departed soul: \"I take refuge in the supreme Scripture Treasure, the Ten-Directional Supreme Saints. Their sacred texts are inscribed with jade characters and golden script, dragon-sealed and phoenix-embossed, comprising thirty-six divisions and eighteen thousand sutras. They guide the lost to the shore of enlightenment, and each verse erases sins while every phrase dissolves offenses. Thus, in this life and all future existences, one must always hold them in faith and reverence.\"\n\n*Third Invocation:*\nProclaim to the departed soul: \"I take refuge in the supreme Teacher Treasure, the Mystic Great Saints, the Three Ancient Masters, the Orthodox One True Person, the Three Heavenly Patriarchs, the Ten-Directional World’s Dao-attained Immortals. They transmit the Dao and impart the scriptures, awakening all beings. They are the true parents, the Great Physician Kings. Thus, in this life and all future existences, one must always hold them in faith and reverence.\"\n\nWith reverence, we acknowledge that the Dao offers the path to transcendence, while scriptures provide the stages of transformation. Sacred texts, adorned with jade and silk, praise the virtues; divine melodies guide the soul to ascend. Human life’s fleeting moments cannot be retained—why linger in regret? Yet the immortal realm’s celestial cultivation is effortless—let them ascend at will. Having heard the Three Treasures’ names, we now proclaim the Ten Radiant Titles.\n\n**The Assembly Recites the Ten Invocations as Follows:**\n\nWith sincere devotion, I pay homage to the Eastern Nine-*Qi* Heavenly Sovereign and all divine officials.
