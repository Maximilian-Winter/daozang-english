  "full_translation": "The *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Ten Masters’ Wondrous Method for Delivering Humanity*\n\nThus spake the Dao:\n\nIn the era of Longhan, sixty myriad *li* west of Mount Kunlun, upon the isles of the sea, there stood a kingdom named Jiuyeliguo. Its sovereign was styled Shengshouluo, ruling over nineteen lesser states, with a domain spanning two hundred thousand *li*. The people of that land were keen of root and wise of intellect, readily susceptible to transformation and deliverance.\n\nThe king’s consort, having planted the roots of virtue in former lives, had awakened to the supreme great Dao, her wisdom penetrating all things. Desiring to deliver the king, she came to be his wife, serving him with devotion, observing the precepts, and maintaining purity of body. She expounded the Dao to the king, whose mind became enlightened and receptive, fit to receive and uphold the teachings.\n\nAt that time, there appeared a perfected immortal, a true person of unmatched renown, vast in scriptural mastery, versed in all the canons. The nineteen lesser states, though acknowledging his vast learning, had never before heard such essential and true teachings. Thus, he aided the king in governing the realm with the correct Dharma.\n\nThe king’s consort personally attended to his needs, as one would serve one’s parents, and had a dwelling prepared for him. Its walls spanned a hundred *zhang*, adorned with the seven treasures: the ridgepoles were of gold, the pillars of coral, the walls of white jade, the floors of lapis lazuli, the patterns of agate, the curtains of crystal. Golden bells of purple hue hung from the four corners, while moon-light mani pearls studded the walls, casting perpetual radiance day and night. Exquisite and wondrous treasures served as his resting place, and delectable, tender viands were offered in his honor.\n\nThe king and his consort, their minds at ease and enlightened, rejoiced greatly in their hearts.\n\nNever before had such marvels been witnessed, and their reverence redoubled. The king immediately dispatched envoys to summon all the great ministers from the nineteen kingdoms, who arrived together at once. The king then declared before them: \"Do you know? I have a national preceptor, unmatched among men. You should all go to him, bow in respect, and together request the principles of governing the realm.\"\n\nAt that time, the ministers each received the king’s command and went to the immortal’s abode. They all paid homage, clasping their hands before their hearts, kneeling long, and said: \"We are benighted and foolish to the extreme. What merit or virtue have we, to be born in honor, cherished by the king, and enjoy such rank?\"\n\nThe immortal replied: \"Excellent, excellent! Listen carefully, listen carefully, and I shall explain the essential meaning to you. In your past lives, you delighted in almsgiving, revered the Three Treasures, and cherished all beings with compassion. Thus, you reaped the karmic reward of noble birth, abundant wealth, and the king’s esteem, attaining your present rank.\"\n\nThen the nineteen ministers each reflected inwardly, their minds enlightened with joy, and said to the immortal: \"We only pray that the great master will teach us the correct method of governing for our kings, so that the realm may be free of calamity, winds and rains timely, the five grains abundant, the people at peace, and all within the borders secure. May we forever bask in your radiant guidance.\"\n\nThe immortal replied: \"Governing correctly is most simple. Why is it simple? Cherish the orphaned and aged, do no wrong to the people, ensure no grievance goes unheard, no prisoner languishes in jail, corvée labor is timely, and the people’s affairs are never neglected. Treat the people as your children. Govern thus, and the realm will be at peace, the people content, all praising the king’s virtue. Malevolent stars will vanish, winds and rains come in season, rulers honorable and ministers loyal, borders tranquil, and the four barbarians will come to submit. With the realm at peace and the people secure, what disaster could arise?\n\nThe king is the arbiter of rewards and punishments. Rewards are for merit, punishments for transgression. If merit goes unrewarded and transgression unpunished, how can one be a ruler? If governance strays from the correct path, the ruler becomes tyrannical above, ministers rebellious below, and the four seas boil in chaos. Thus, comets appear at night, winds and rains come untimely, the people suffer hardship, locusts devour the land, and yin and yang fall into disorder. All this stems from the king and his great ministers wronging the innocent, imposing corvée without measure, relying on their power and wealth, acting with arrogance and pride, neglecting state affairs, and bringing suffering to the people, who long for an end to chaos. Heavenly spirits and earthly deities no longer protect them, and myriad evils draw near. This is the path of self-harm. To illustrate, there are four things in the world called self-harm. What are the four?\n\nFirst, a tree laden with blossoms and fruit breaks its own branches.\nSecond, iron bound to a frame destroys its own form.\nThird, a venomous snake harbors poison and harms its own body.\nFourth, a king without the Dao harms his own realm.\n\nAs a shadow follows form and an echo follows sound, so is the natural law of Heaven.\"\n\nThen the ministers’ minds were opened and enlightened. They rose, bowed, and took their leave. The nineteen ministers each returned to their kingdoms and fully explained the correct governance to their kings. The kings rejoiced greatly and sent their ministers back, bearing precious treasures to offer a grand feast. For seven days and seven nights, they expounded the Mahayana sutras.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable, seated in majesty upon the Great Brahma Heaven, gazed afar with his Dao-eye and saw that the nineteen kings had all awakened the mind for the Dao. He then transformed himself into an immortal, indistinguishable from the other, and entered the palace hall. There, he greeted them and inquired after their well-being, expounding the essentials of the supreme, correct, and true Dao without weariness.\n\nThen, by his divine power, the Heavenly Venerable caused the other immortal not to recognize him as the Heavenly Venerable. The king, his consort, and the nineteen ministers, seeing the two immortals seated solemnly before them, each thought to themselves: \"Which of these two great masters is the teacher, and which the disciple?\"\n\nAt that moment, the Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, transformed a single lapis lazuli pearl and placed it in the center of his palm. He showed it to all the ministers and addressed them: \"Behold this pearl, luminous within and without, without obstruction or hindrance.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"I see you all as this pearl, likewise without obstruction.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable, wishing to display his divine transformations, then addressed them, saying: \"Now I shall demonstrate your Dao-power.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Venerable rose into the empty sky, with nothing above to cling to nor below to rely upon. Suddenly, he descended to the earth, treading upon the ground as if it were water, and upon water as if it were earth, then returned to his seat.\n\nThe king, his consort, and all the ministers, witnessing this divine power, said to one another: \"This great master’s spiritual power is supreme. Never before have we seen such a rare and wondrous thing.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, transformed himself, displaying the thirty-two marks and eighty excellences. From his crown emanated radiant light, illuminating the ten directions, eclipsing the sun and moon so that they were no longer visible. Earth, stones, mountains, all grasses and trees turned to gold, as if submerged in the waters of a kalpa—vast and boundless—so that all things vanished from sight, leaving only the great waters. Even so was the Heavenly Venerable’s light. Wherever darkness and gloom reigned, where even the bright light of the sun and moon could not penetrate, all became brilliantly illuminated. The beings within could see one another and exclaimed in wonder: \"How is it that you have suddenly appeared here?\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable manifested a vast body, immeasurable and boundless, filling the empty sky without gap or space. Suddenly, he shrank to a size as minute as a speck of dust. After these transformations, from his mouth in the empty sky he emitted five-colored wondrous light, which transformed into a jeweled canopy and a lion-throne adorned with lotuses. Its brows were of silver, its roots of agate, its base of lapis lazuli, its pillars of purple gold, its beams of crystal, its leaves of giant clam, its dais of exquisite treasures, its blossoms of bright moon pearls, and its adornments of rare and wondrous jewels.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable manifested his form and seated himself upon the throne. Nineteen great kings, along with all the people from the ten directions, beheld the Heavenly Venerable in the empty sky, upon the seven-jeweled lotus throne. Each gathered fragrant flowers in their robes and, following the light, came to scatter them upon the Heavenly Venerable. They circled him three times from afar, paid their respects, and took their seats.\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable once more transformed in the empty sky, creating hundreds of thousands of jeweled canopies. Beneath them were hundreds of thousands of lion-thrones, and upon each throne sat a Heavenly Venerable. Each Heavenly Venerable was attended by hundreds of thousands of jade maidens and immortal youths. Moreover, tens of millions of boundless multitudes emerged from the earth, each scattering wondrous celestial flowers upon the Heavenly Venerable. The scattered flowers came from all ten directions, drifting down in profusion like snow falling from the heavens. Celestial musicians played their instruments in the empty sky, all at once. Then came the demon kings with their armies—among them, one had a human body and a beast’s head, others took the forms of dragons or serpents, each assuming various strange shapes. Following the light, they arrived at the Heavenly Venerable’s abode, bowed in reverence, and sat to one side. Great ghost kings, yakṣas, rākṣasas, agricultural spirits, and countless others all gathered together. Exotic birds with wondrous voices, their songs in eight tones, circled the Heavenly Venerable from afar, pouring forth their elegant melodies.\n\nThen came the Four Great Dragon Kings. The Dragon King of the Eastern Sea wore blue robes, a blue crown, carried a blue banner and a blue canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in blue. The Dragon King of the Southern Sea wore red robes, a red crown, carried a red banner and a red canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in red. The Dragon King of the Western Sea wore white robes, a white crown, carried a white banner and a white canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in white. The Dragon King of the Northern Sea wore black robes, a black crown, carried a black banner and a black canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in black. All followed the light, arriving at the Heavenly Venerable’s abode, circling him three times, paying their respects, and taking their seats.\n\nAt that time, seeing the boundless multitude assembled, the Heavenly Venerable transformed and manifested hundreds of thousands of Heavenly Venerables, who descended from his crown and entered him, then suddenly vanished. With a single voice, he expounded the Mahāyāna scriptures to this great assembly—celestial beings, humans, ghosts, and spirits alike. Then the eight divisions of gods and dragons, each according to their kind, understood the Heavenly Venerable’s single voice. They said to one another: \"Today, the Heavenly Venerable has expounded the profound meaning of the true Dharma, offering much illumination.\"\n\nThe immortals, witnessing these divine transformations beyond thought, saw hundreds of thousands of Heavenly Venerables seated upon seven-jeweled lion-thrones, who then entered through his crown and completely vanished. They addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: \"Earlier, we saw hundreds of thousands of boundless Heavenly Venerables and their attendants—now they have all disappeared. Should we have no doubts? The demon hosts may come to disturb us.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable then spoke to the immortals and the great assembly: \"It is like placing a hundred basins of water on a quiet night, each reflecting a moon. Are there a hundred moons in the sky?\" The immortals replied, \"No.\" The Heavenly Venerable said: \"My body is likewise. Just as the single moon in the sky is reflected in a hundred basins of water, what is strange about this?\"\n\nAs these words were spoken, three hundred and sixty people attained the rank of minor immortals, thirty thousand celestial beings attained the rank of superior immortals, and the nineteen great kings all became divine immortals. Then each of the great kings thought to themselves: \"Such a vast assembly—we should all bathe in fragrant waters.\" The Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, instantly created a pure pool with a golden bed and silver sand. The water within was clear and infused with subtle fragrance, neither cold nor hot, perfectly balanced in temperature to please all. After bathing, when they wished the water to reach their feet, it rose to their feet; when they wished it to reach their knees, it rose to their knees; when they wished it to reach their waists, it rose to their waists; when they wished it to bathe their bodies, it bathed their bodies. All who entered the pool aroused the mind aspiring to the supreme, true, and great Dao, and their illnesses were cured. The pool’s bed bloomed with wondrous flowers—jeweled blossoms, thousand-petaled lotuses, and various celestial flowers—whose eightfold fragrance, when smelled by worldly people, granted them celestial immortality and the supreme Dao.\n\nThe supreme Dao is neither born nor dies, neither perishes nor decays, neither changes nor alters, neither comes nor goes, neither real nor empty. Yet it does not depart from emptiness, abiding in serene stillness—this is called the supreme great Dao. As these words were spoken, the celestial beings of the ten directions attained the supreme Dao, and thirty-seven immortals all achieved the six supernatural powers and the fruits of the Dao.\n\nThen the great kings murmured to themselves: \"The midday meal has arrived. How can such a vast multitude be fed?\" The Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, said to the kings: \"It is but a single basin of rice.\" By his divine power, he multiplied one basin of rice, allowing the boundless multitude to eat their fill. The leftover rice became as vast as Mount Kunlun.\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable, displaying his wondrous power, took Mount Kunlun and placed it in his palm, ascending to the Great Brahmā Heaven. The entire assembly witnessed this—Mount Kunlun resting in his right palm, yet he did not rise from his seat. He displayed it to the ten directions, then returned it to its original place as effortlessly as a strong man flexing his arm, without causing any harm.\n\nThose in the great assembly who heard the essential Dharma—whether indolent or eager—experienced seven days as a single kalpa, and those who listened believed it was merely mealtime. The nineteen great kings, witnessing these divine powers and merits, the supreme accomplishment of the great Dharma ritual, and the liberation of boundless beings, asked: \"From which teacher did you learn this Mahāyāna? Pray, reveal to us the abode of our original master.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke: \"Excellent, excellent! Listen carefully, listen carefully. I have ten teachers, and they are not far from you.\"\n\nThe nineteen kings rose, stepped forward, bowed in reverence, and knelt, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"We pray you reveal to us the abode of our original master.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke: \"I see that worldly people, craving flavors, kill living beings, making hunting and fishing their livelihood. They fly hawks and run dogs, shoot birds with slings, cutting short the lives of countless beings. Upon death, they enter hell, and only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn as mayflies—born at dawn, dead by dusk. This is the retribution for having ended others’ lives in past existences. Seeing this, I have vowed never to kill, and thus I have attained a long-lived, indestructible body. This is my first teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people steal in secret, evade debts, and flee from obligations. Upon death, they enter hell, and only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn among donkeys and beasts of burden, bearing heavy loads, whipped and tormented. After death, their skins are flayed—agonizing, agonizing! Seeing this, I have vowed never to steal, and thus I naturally possess treasures. This is my second teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people harbor constant anger, harboring venomous resentment, their hearts filled with hatred, never free from sorrow and poison. Upon death, they enter hell and fall into evil destinies. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn among vipers. Seeing this, I have vowed never to harbor anger, and thus I have attained unshakable strength. This is my third teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people, consumed by lust, commit adultery and violate others’ spouses. Upon death, they enter hell—men embracing copper pillars, women lying on iron beds, their bodies scorched and burned, their pain unbearable. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn as eunuchs or barren women, enduring this for five hundred lifetimes. Seeing this, I have vowed never to commit adultery, keeping my body and mind pure. This is my fourth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people sow discord with duplicitous speech, spreading rumors, slandering others, and uttering false and frivolous words. They cause rulers and ministers, parents and children, friends and acquaintances to sever bonds of affection and trust, turning all relationships faithless. Upon death, they enter hell, where their tongues are torn out and molten copper poured into their mouths. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn among cattle, knowing only water and grass, ignorant of all else. If reborn as humans, they are born deaf and mute, their breath foul, disliked by all. Whatever they say, no one heeds them. Seeing this, I have vowed never to sow discord. Thus, my voice now possesses eight qualities, my words become the law, and all heavenly and human beings delight in hearing them. This is my fifth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people envy those superior to themselves, competing for fame and gain, quarreling and clamoring, never yielding to others. Upon death, they enter hell, and only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn in remote barbarian lands, deaf, blind, and mute—possessing human form but lacking human nature. Seeing this, I have vowed never to envy. Thus, my wisdom is now like the sea, my expedient means boundless, free from all delusions, my teachings inexhaustible. Among all assemblies, I am the most revered and supreme, like holding a torch in a dark room, dispelling all darkness. This is my sixth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people crave wine and rich flavors, becoming drunk and disorderly, cursing and reviling, losing the true Dharma and the pure nature of the Dao. They accumulate evil karma and, upon death, enter the boiling excrement hell, where they constantly endure foul stenches day and night. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge. If reborn as humans, they are mad, deaf, and mentally deranged, forever unable to hear the wondrous sounds of the true Dharma. Seeing this, I have vowed never to drink wine. Thus, my mind is now like the sun and moon, illuminating all, making even the darkest places bright and clear. This is my seventh teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people hoard wealth, unwilling to bestow charity, refusing to share even with their own brothers, wives, and children, clinging to their riches until death. Afterward, they are reborn among hungry ghosts, where water turns to pus and food to burning coals. Seeing this, I have vowed never to be miserly. Thus, I now partake of the celestial kitchen’s feast, where a hundred flavors arise naturally. This is my eighth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people, relying on their wealth and status, belittle the orphaned and the elderly, mocking and ridiculing them. Later, they are reborn in lowly and humble circumstances, short in stature, scorned by all, enduring the very suffering they once inflicted. Thus, when I see the poor, the short, the crippled, the deformed, and those with incomplete faculties, I feel deep compassion. Therefore, I have attained a pure and wondrous body, radiant and supreme, unmatched among all heavenly and human beings and in all Dharma realms. This is my ninth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people disrespect their parents, disregard their uncles and elders, and neglect their children and grandchildren. They ignore their parents’ teachings, refusing to obey. As children, they are unfilial; as parents, they are unkind; as elder brothers, they are disrespectful; as younger brothers, they are disobedient; as husbands, they are unfaithful; as wives, they are unchaste. Upon death, they enter hell, endlessly cycling through the five destinies, with no hope of escape. Later, they are reborn among maggots, spontaneously generated, without parents, spouses, children, or kin. Only after a kalpa do they become human again, born among barbarians in lands without propriety or righteousness. Seeing this, I diligently practice the Dao, ensuring that my seven generations of ancestors are all reborn in heaven. This is my tenth teacher.\n\nBy practicing all these virtues, I have attained the six spiritual penetrations, witnessed boundless wisdom, and gained the power of unimpeded spiritual transformation, reaching the bodhimanda. As these words were spoken, the heavenly and human beings of the ten directions all attained the true Dao. Even the demon kings and ghosts beheld the inconceivable traces of the Dao. As the true Dharma was expounded, the immortals and transcendents also attained the highest truth.\n\nThen, the immortals rose from their seats, prostrating themselves with their heads and feet, kneeling and addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"How should we uphold this great scripture today?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"This is called *The Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure’s Divine Transformations and Ten Teachers for Delivering Beings*. You should uphold it. If one were to carry a load of dry grass into a great fire and the fire could not burn it, that would not be considered difficult.\"\n\nIf one were to hurl Mount Kunlun far into another realm, that too would not be considered difficult. Yet to read this scripture and explain it to others—this is truly difficult.\n\nThose who seek to become immortals must read this scripture. Those who seek noble renown must read this scripture. Those who seek wealth, honor, and long life must read this scripture. Those who seek to meet enlightened teachers in every lifetime must read this scripture.\n\nThis scripture is most revered, mightier than even my own divine power. Those who uphold, transcribe, read, or recite it shall be distinguished in my sight. Though I have not yet revealed myself to you, I shall cause such a person to sit in the Dao-ground, where the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions will lay their hands upon their crown, bestowing spiritual protection and shielding them from decline and suffering.\n\nWhen this scripture was expounded, the gods of heaven, dragons, and all the great assembly heard the true teaching and rejoiced. They rose together, stepped forward, and bowed in reverence before departing.\n\n*The Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure’s Divine Transformations and Ten Teachers for Delivering Beings* concludes.",

You should all go to him, bow in respect, and together request the principles of governing the realm.\"\n\nAt that time, the ministers each received the king’s command and went to the immortal’s abode.

Thus, you reaped the karmic reward of noble birth, abundant wealth, and the king’s esteem, attaining your present rank.\"\n\nThen the nineteen ministers each reflected inwardly, their minds enlightened with joy, and said to the immortal: \"We only pray that the great master will teach us the correct method of governing for our kings, so that the realm may be free of calamity, winds and rains timely, the five grains abundant, the people at peace, and all within the borders secure. May we forever bask in your radiant guidance.\"\n\nThe immortal replied: \"Governing correctly is most simple. Why is it simple? Cherish the orphaned and aged, do no wrong to the people, ensure no grievance goes unheard, no prisoner languishes in jail, corvée labor is timely, and the people’s affairs are never neglected. Treat the people as your children. Govern thus, and the realm will be at peace, the people content, all praising the king’s virtue. Malevolent stars will vanish, winds and rains come in season, rulers honorable and ministers loyal, borders tranquil, and the four barbarians will come to submit. With the realm at peace and the people secure, what disaster could arise?\n\nThe king is the arbiter of rewards and punishments. Rewards are for merit, punishments for transgression. If merit goes unrewarded and transgression unpunished, how can one be a ruler? If governance strays from the correct path, the ruler becomes tyrannical above, ministers rebellious below, and the four seas boil in chaos. Thus, comets appear at night, winds and rains come untimely, the people suffer hardship, locusts devour the land, and yin and yang fall into disorder. All this stems from the king and his great ministers wronging the innocent, imposing corvée without measure, relying on their power and wealth, acting with arrogance and pride, neglecting state affairs, and bringing suffering to the people, who long for an end to chaos. Heavenly spirits and earthly deities no longer protect them, and myriad evils draw near. This is the path of self-harm. To illustrate, there are four things in the world called self-harm. What are the four?\n\nFirst, a tree laden with blossoms and fruit breaks its own branches.\nSecond, iron bound to a frame destroys its own form.\nThird, a venomous snake harbors poison and harms its own body.\nFourth, a king without the Dao harms his own realm.\n\nAs a shadow follows form and an echo follows sound, so is the natural law of Heaven.\"\n\nThen the ministers’ minds were opened and enlightened. They rose, bowed, and took their leave. The nineteen ministers each returned to their kingdoms and fully explained the correct governance to their kings. The kings rejoiced greatly and sent their ministers back, bearing precious treasures to offer a grand feast. For seven days and seven nights, they expounded the Mahayana sutras.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable, seated in majesty upon the Great Brahma Heaven, gazed afar with his Dao-eye and saw that the nineteen kings had all awakened the mind for the Dao. He then transformed himself into an immortal, indistinguishable from the other, and entered the palace hall. There, he greeted them and inquired after their well-being, expounding the essentials of the supreme, correct, and true Dao without weariness.\n\nThen, by his divine power, the Heavenly Venerable caused the other immortal not to recognize him as the Heavenly Venerable. The king, his consort, and the nineteen ministers, seeing the two immortals seated solemnly before them, each thought to themselves: \"Which of these two great masters is the teacher, and which the disciple?\"\n\nAt that moment, the Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, transformed a single lapis lazuli pearl and placed it in the center of his palm. He showed it to all the ministers and addressed them: \"Behold this pearl, luminous within and without, without obstruction or hindrance.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"I see you all as this pearl, likewise without obstruction.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable, wishing to display his divine transformations, then addressed them, saying: \"Now I shall demonstrate your Dao-power.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Venerable rose into the empty sky, with nothing above to cling to nor below to rely upon. Suddenly, he descended to the earth, treading upon the ground as if it were water, and upon water as if it were earth, then returned to his seat.\n\nThe king, his consort, and all the ministers, witnessing this divine power, said to one another: \"This great master’s spiritual power is supreme. Never before have we seen such a rare and wondrous thing.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, transformed himself, displaying the thirty-two marks and eighty excellences. From his crown emanated radiant light, illuminating the ten directions, eclipsing the sun and moon so that they were no longer visible. Earth, stones, mountains, all grasses and trees turned to gold, as if submerged in the waters of a kalpa—vast and boundless—so that all things vanished from sight, leaving only the great waters. Even so was the Heavenly Venerable’s light. Wherever darkness and gloom reigned, where even the bright light of the sun and moon could not penetrate, all became brilliantly illuminated. The beings within could see one another and exclaimed in wonder: \"How is it that you have suddenly appeared here?\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable manifested a vast body, immeasurable and boundless, filling the empty sky without gap or space. Suddenly, he shrank to a size as minute as a speck of dust. After these transformations, from his mouth in the empty sky he emitted five-colored wondrous light, which transformed into a jeweled canopy and a lion-throne adorned with lotuses. Its brows were of silver, its roots of agate, its base of lapis lazuli, its pillars of purple gold, its beams of crystal, its leaves of giant clam, its dais of exquisite treasures, its blossoms of bright moon pearls, and its adornments of rare and wondrous jewels.",

Exquisite and wondrous treasures served as his resting place, and delectable, tender viands were offered in his honor.\n\nThe king and his consort, their minds at ease and enlightened, rejoiced greatly in their hearts.",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Venerable manifested his form and seated himself upon the throne. Nineteen great kings, along with all the people from the ten directions, beheld the Heavenly Venerable in the empty sky, upon the seven-jeweled lotus throne. Each gathered fragrant flowers in their robes and, following the light, came to scatter them upon the Heavenly Venerable. They circled him three times from afar, paid their respects, and took their seats.\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable once more transformed in the empty sky, creating hundreds of thousands of jeweled canopies. Beneath them were hundreds of thousands of lion-thrones, and upon each throne sat a Heavenly Venerable. Each Heavenly Venerable was attended by hundreds of thousands of jade maidens and immortal youths. Moreover, tens of millions of boundless multitudes emerged from the earth, each scattering wondrous celestial flowers upon the Heavenly Venerable. The scattered flowers came from all ten directions, drifting down in profusion like snow falling from the heavens. Celestial musicians played their instruments in the empty sky, all at once. Then came the demon kings with their armies—among them, one had a human body and a beast’s head, others took the forms of dragons or serpents, each assuming various strange shapes. Following the light, they arrived at the Heavenly Venerable’s abode, bowed in reverence, and sat to one side. Great ghost kings, yakṣas, rākṣasas, agricultural spirits, and countless others all gathered together. Exotic birds with wondrous voices, their songs in eight tones, circled the Heavenly Venerable from afar, pouring forth their elegant melodies.\n\nThen came the Four Great Dragon Kings. The Dragon King of the Eastern Sea wore blue robes, a blue crown, carried a blue banner and a blue canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in blue. The Dragon King of the Southern Sea wore red robes, a red crown, carried a red banner and a red canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in red. The Dragon King of the Western Sea wore white robes, a white crown, carried a white banner and a white canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in white. The Dragon King of the Northern Sea wore black robes, a black crown, carried a black banner and a black canopy, and was followed by an innumerable host clad in black. All followed the light, arriving at the Heavenly Venerable’s abode, circling him three times, paying their respects, and taking their seats.\n\nAt that time, seeing the boundless multitude assembled, the Heavenly Venerable transformed and manifested hundreds of thousands of Heavenly Venerables, who descended from his crown and entered him, then suddenly vanished. With a single voice, he expounded the Mahāyāna scriptures to this great assembly—celestial beings, humans, ghosts, and spirits alike. Then the eight divisions of gods and dragons, each according to their kind, understood the Heavenly Venerable’s single voice. They said to one another: \"Today, the Heavenly Venerable has expounded the profound meaning of the true Dharma, offering much illumination.\"\n\nThe immortals, witnessing these divine transformations beyond thought, saw hundreds of thousands of Heavenly Venerables seated upon seven-jeweled lion-thrones, who then entered through his crown and completely vanished. They addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: \"Earlier, we saw hundreds of thousands of boundless Heavenly Venerables and their attendants—now they have all disappeared. Should we have no doubts? The demon hosts may come to disturb us.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable then spoke to the immortals and the great assembly: \"It is like placing a hundred basins of water on a quiet night, each reflecting a moon. Are there a hundred moons in the sky?\" The immortals replied, \"No.\" The Heavenly Venerable said: \"My body is likewise. Just as the single moon in the sky is reflected in a hundred basins of water, what is strange about this?\"\n\nAs these words were spoken, three hundred and sixty people attained the rank of minor immortals, thirty thousand celestial beings attained the rank of superior immortals, and the nineteen great kings all became divine immortals. Then each of the great kings thought to themselves: \"Such a vast assembly—we should all bathe in fragrant waters.\" The Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, instantly created a pure pool with a golden bed and silver sand. The water within was clear and infused with subtle fragrance, neither cold nor hot, perfectly balanced in temperature to please all. After bathing, when they wished the water to reach their feet, it rose to their feet; when they wished it to reach their knees, it rose to their knees; when they wished it to reach their waists, it rose to their waists; when they wished it to bathe their bodies, it bathed their bodies. All who entered the pool aroused the mind aspiring to the supreme, true, and great Dao, and their illnesses were cured. The pool’s bed bloomed with wondrous flowers—jeweled blossoms, thousand-petaled lotuses, and various celestial flowers—whose eightfold fragrance, when smelled by worldly people, granted them celestial immortality and the supreme Dao.\n\nThe supreme Dao is neither born nor dies, neither perishes nor decays, neither changes nor alters, neither comes nor goes, neither real nor empty. Yet it does not depart from emptiness, abiding in serene stillness—this is called the supreme great Dao. As these words were spoken, the celestial beings of the ten directions attained the supreme Dao, and thirty-seven immortals all achieved the six supernatural powers and the fruits of the Dao.\n\nThen the great kings murmured to themselves: \"The midday meal has arrived. How can such a vast multitude be fed?\" The Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, said to the kings: \"It is but a single basin of rice.\" By his divine power, he multiplied one basin of rice, allowing the boundless multitude to eat their fill. The leftover rice became as vast as Mount Kunlun.\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable, displaying his wondrous power, took Mount Kunlun and placed it in his palm, ascending to the Great Brahmā Heaven. The entire assembly witnessed this—Mount Kunlun resting in his right palm, yet he did not rise from his seat. He displayed it to the ten directions, then returned it to its original place as effortlessly as a strong man flexing his arm, without causing any harm.\n\nThose in the great assembly who heard the essential Dharma—whether indolent or eager—experienced seven days as a single kalpa, and those who listened believed it was merely mealtime. The nineteen great kings, witnessing these divine powers and merits, the supreme accomplishment of the great Dharma ritual, and the liberation of boundless beings, asked: \"From which teacher did you learn this Mahāyāna? Pray, reveal to us the abode of our original master.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Worthy spoke: \"Excellent, excellent! Listen carefully, listen carefully. I have ten teachers, and they are not far from you.\"\n\nThe nineteen kings rose, stepped forward, bowed in reverence, and knelt, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"We pray you reveal to us the abode of our original master.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke: \"I see that worldly people, craving flavors, kill living beings, making hunting and fishing their livelihood. They fly hawks and run dogs, shoot birds with slings, cutting short the lives of countless beings. Upon death, they enter hell, and only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn as mayflies—born at dawn, dead by dusk. This is the retribution for having ended others’ lives in past existences. Seeing this, I have vowed never to kill, and thus I have attained a long-lived, indestructible body. This is my first teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people steal in secret, evade debts, and flee from obligations. Upon death, they enter hell, and only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn among donkeys and beasts of burden, bearing heavy loads, whipped and tormented. After death, their skins are flayed—agonizing, agonizing! Seeing this, I have vowed never to steal, and thus I naturally possess treasures. This is my second teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people harbor constant anger, harboring venomous resentment, their hearts filled with hatred, never free from sorrow and poison. Upon death, they enter hell and fall into evil destinies. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn among vipers. Seeing this, I have vowed never to harbor anger, and thus I have attained unshakable strength. This is my third teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people, consumed by lust, commit adultery and violate others’ spouses. Upon death, they enter hell—men embracing copper pillars, women lying on iron beds, their bodies scorched and burned, their pain unbearable. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn as eunuchs or barren women, enduring this for five hundred lifetimes. Seeing this, I have vowed never to commit adultery, keeping my body and mind pure. This is my fourth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people sow discord with duplicitous speech, spreading rumors, slandering others, and uttering false and frivolous words. They cause rulers and ministers, parents and children, friends and acquaintances to sever bonds of affection and trust, turning all relationships faithless. Upon death, they enter hell, where their tongues are torn out and molten copper poured into their mouths. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn among cattle, knowing only water and grass, ignorant of all else. If reborn as humans, they are born deaf and mute, their breath foul, disliked by all. Whatever they say, no one heeds them. Seeing this, I have vowed never to sow discord. Thus, my voice now possesses eight qualities, my words become the law, and all heavenly and human beings delight in hearing them. This is my fifth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people envy those superior to themselves, competing for fame and gain, quarreling and clamoring, never yielding to others. Upon death, they enter hell, and only after countless kalpas do they emerge, reborn in remote barbarian lands, deaf, blind, and mute—possessing human form but lacking human nature. Seeing this, I have vowed never to envy. Thus, my wisdom is now like the sea, my expedient means boundless, free from all delusions, my teachings inexhaustible. Among all assemblies, I am the most revered and supreme, like holding a torch in a dark room, dispelling all darkness. This is my sixth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people crave wine and rich flavors, becoming drunk and disorderly, cursing and reviling, losing the true Dharma and the pure nature of the Dao. They accumulate evil karma and, upon death, enter the boiling excrement hell, where they constantly endure foul stenches day and night. Only after countless kalpas do they emerge. If reborn as humans, they are mad, deaf, and mentally deranged, forever unable to hear the wondrous sounds of the true Dharma. Seeing this, I have vowed never to drink wine. Thus, my mind is now like the sun and moon, illuminating all, making even the darkest places bright and clear. This is my seventh teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people hoard wealth, unwilling to bestow charity, refusing to share even with their own brothers, wives, and children, clinging to their riches until death. Afterward, they are reborn among hungry ghosts, where water turns to pus and food to burning coals. Seeing this, I have vowed never to be miserly. Thus, I now partake of the celestial kitchen’s feast, where a hundred flavors arise naturally. This is my eighth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people, relying on their wealth and status, belittle the orphaned and the elderly, mocking and ridiculing them. Later, they are reborn in lowly and humble circumstances, short in stature, scorned by all, enduring the very suffering they once inflicted. Thus, when I see the poor, the short, the crippled, the deformed, and those with incomplete faculties, I feel deep compassion. Therefore, I have attained a pure and wondrous body, radiant and supreme, unmatched among all heavenly and human beings and in all Dharma realms. This is my ninth teacher.\n\nI see that worldly people disrespect their parents, disregard their uncles and elders, and neglect their children and grandchildren. They ignore their parents’ teachings, refusing to obey. As children, they are unfilial; as parents, they are unkind; as elder brothers, they are disrespectful; as younger brothers, they are disobedient; as husbands, they are unfaithful; as wives, they are unchaste. Upon death, they enter hell, endlessly cycling through the five destinies, with no hope of escape. Later, they are reborn among maggots, spontaneously generated, without parents, spouses, children, or kin. Only after a kalpa do they become human again, born among barbarians in lands without propriety or righteousness. Seeing this, I diligently practice the Dao, ensuring that my seven generations of ancestors are all reborn in heaven. This is my tenth teacher.\n\nBy practicing all these virtues, I have attained the six spiritual penetrations, witnessed boundless wisdom, and gained the power of unimpeded spiritual transformation, reaching the bodhimanda. As these words were spoken, the heavenly and human beings of the ten directions all attained the true Dao. Even the demon kings and ghosts beheld the inconceivable traces of the Dao. As the true Dharma was expounded, the immortals and transcendents also attained the highest truth.\n\nThen, the immortals rose from their seats, prostrating themselves with their heads and feet, kneeling and addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"How should we uphold this great scripture today?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"This is called *The Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure’s Divine Transformations and Ten Teachers for Delivering Beings*. You should uphold it. If one were to carry a load of dry grass into a great fire and the fire could not burn it, that would not be considered difficult.\"",

Yet to read this scripture and explain it to others—this is truly difficult.\n\nThose who seek to become immortals must read this scripture. Those who seek noble renown must read this scripture. Those who seek wealth, honor, and long life must read this scripture. Those who seek to meet enlightened teachers in every lifetime must read this scripture.\n\nThis scripture is most revered, mightier than even my own divine power. Those who uphold, transcribe, read, or recite it shall be distinguished in my sight. Though I have not yet revealed myself to you, I shall cause such a person to sit in the Dao-ground, where the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions will lay their hands upon their crown, bestowing spiritual protection and shielding them from decline and suffering.\n\nWhen this scripture was expounded, the gods of heaven, dragons, and all the great assembly heard the true teaching and rejoiced. They rose together, stepped forward, and bowed in reverence before departing.\n\n*The Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure’s Divine Transformations and Ten Teachers for Delivering Beings* concludes.",

You should uphold it. If one were to carry a load of dry grass into a great fire and the fire could not burn it, that would not be considered difficult.\"",
