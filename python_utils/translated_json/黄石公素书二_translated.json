According to the *Records of the Former Han* (Xiàn Hàn), this text was the one the Yellow Stone Master imparted to Jiāng Zǐfáng at the Yǐqiáo Bridge. Many assume it to be *The Three Strategies* (Sānlüè), but this is the error of the transmitters.\n\nDuring the chaos of the Jin dynasty, bandits raided Jiāng Zǐfáng’s tomb, and within a jade pillow, they found this book—**1,336 words in total**—with a secret injunction forbidding its transmission to those who are **not aligned with the Dao**, **not attuned to the sacred**, **not reverent of the Holy**, or **not virtuous**. If one does not belong to such a person, they will suffer misfortune; if one obtains it but does not pass it on, they will also suffer misfortune.\n\n**Ah! How grave and weighty this is.**\n\nThe Yellow Stone Master obtained *Essentials of the Dao* (Sūshū) and transmitted it to Jiāng Zǐfáng, yet Jiāng Zǐfáng did not fully grasp its teachings and thus buried it. Five hundred years later, bandits unearthed it, and from then on, *Essentials of the Dao* began to circulate among mortals. Yet what was transmitted was merely the Yellow Stone Master’s words, and can his intent truly be exhausted by speech?\n\nI have often reflected: the Dao/Way of Heaven and humanity has never ceased to mutually benefit one another, and the ancient sages all devoted their hearts to it. Yáo revered the Heavenly Vault (Hào Tiān), Shùn harmonized the Seven Celestial Administrations (Qī Zhèng), Yǔ honored the Nine Regions (Jiǔ Chóu), and the sage Fùyuē expounded the Heavenly Dao. Wén Wáng emphasized the Eight Trigrams (Bā Guà), Zhōu Gōng established the Heavenly and Earthly Four Seasons’ Offices (Sìshí Guān), and further appointed the Three Ministers (Sān Gōng) to reconcile the balance of yin and yang. Kǒngzǐ sought to transcend words, while Lǎozǐ grounded it in the eternal and boundless (Cháng Wúyǒu).\n\nThe *Yīn Fú Jīng* (Scripture of the Yin Symbol) states:\n*\"The cosmos lies within the palm, all transformations arise from the body. When the Dao reaches this level, even ghosts and spirits cannot evade my mastery—how much more so the matters of punitive governance and measures!\"*\n\nThe Yellow Stone Master was a reclusive sage of the Qín. His words are concise, his meaning profound—even the sages Yáo, Shùn, Yǔ, Wén Wáng, Fùyuē, Zhōu Gōng, Kǒngzǐ, and Lǎozǐ could not surpass this. Thus, the Yellow Stone Master, knowing that the Qín would fall and the Hàn would rise, entrusted this book to Jiāng Zǐfáng. Yet could Jiāng Zǐfáng truly comprehend its entirety? His mastery was but partial, applying only a few of its precepts.\n\nThe book says: *\"Cunning schemes leaked to the outside lead to ruin.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor (Gāo Dì) to honor Hàn Xìn.\nThe book says: *\"Small grudges are unforgivable; great grudges must be resolved.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor to grant titles to Yōng Yì.\nThe book says: *\"Decisions made by the unvirtuous are perilous.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor to abandon the封封 (fēngfēng) of the Six Kingdoms.\nThe book says: *\"Deploying stratagems and exercising authority resolves deadlocks.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, summoning the Four Worthies (Sì Hào) to establish the Emperor Huì.\nThe book says: *\"No greater fortune exists than contentment.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, choosing to remain and封封 (fēngfēng) himself.\nThe book says: *\"Severing desires and restraining appetites removes burdens.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, abandoning worldly affairs and following Chìsōngzǐ.\n\nAlas! Though he discarded its dross and sediment, Jiāng Zǐfáng’s partial use was still enough to destroy the Qín and the Yǐng, while establishing the Emperor of Pèi. How much greater the effects would have been if he had applied it fully and delved into its depths!\n\nSince the Hàn dynasty, the study of章章 (zhāngzhāng) exegesis and文词 (wéncí) rhetoric has flourished, yet those who truly grasp the Dao have grown exceedingly rare. Figures like Zhēng Zhūliè, Wáng Měng, Fáng Qiáo, and Kuī Dù, though hailed as eminent ministers of their time, never truly understood the grand Dao of the ancient kings. This is why *Essentials of the Dao* was forbidden to transmission to those **not aligned with the Dao**, **not attuned to the sacred**, **not reverent of the Holy**, or **not virtuous**.\n\nThe Dao is the interplay of presence and absence (Lí Yǒu Lí Wú); the sacred is the transcendence of fixed definitions (Fēi Yǒu Fēi Wú); reverence for the Holy is the mastery of presence within absence (Yǒu Ér Wú); and virtue is the cultivation of absence within presence (Wú Ér Yǒu). Without these four qualities, even if one recites this book by rote, they cannot truly embody its teachings.\n\nThe *Preface of Heavenly Awakening* by Zhāng Shāngyīng. #1 *The original lacks a title; this one is supplied based on the text’s headings.*\n\n**Yellow Stone Master’s *Essentials of the Dao* (Sūshū) – Annotated by Zhāng Shāngyīng of the Sòng dynasty.**\n\n**Chapter One: On the Origin of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao cannot be said to have a beginning.\nDao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—these five are one in essence.\nSeparated in application, they become five; unified in essence, they return to one.\nOne unifies the five; the five manifest the one.\nThe Dao is what people tread upon, yet it is such that all things are unaware of its path.\nThe Dao’s influence pervades all things—vast and great.\nA single breath, a single word, a single movement or stillness, a single act of eating or drinking—whether in the grandness beyond the eight strings of the *qín* or the minutiae within the dust of the *mángyè* plant—where is there that is not the Dao?\n\nBenevolence is insufficient to name it, so the benevolent see it and call it benevolence.\nWisdom is insufficient to exhaust it, so the wise see it and call it wisdom.\nThe common folk are insufficient to perceive it, so it is said: *\"It is used, yet they know not.\"*\n\nVirtue is what people attain, allowing all things to fulfill their desires.\nDesire is what is sought.\nIf one seeks and does not attain, it is not the utmost of virtue.\nTo seek from the compass and square, one attains only the square and the circle.\nTo seek from the scales, one attains only lightness and heaviness.\nBut to seek from virtue—there is no desire that is not fulfilled:\nSovereign and minister, father and son attain it and thus become sovereign and minister, father and son;\nInsects and grasses attain it and thus become insects and grasses.\nThe great become great through it, the small become small through it.\nNearly, it encompasses the self; distantly, it encompasses all things.\nThere is no desire that is not fulfilled.\n\nBenevolence is what people hold dear—possessing compassion, kindness, and pity to nurture life’s fulfillment.\nBenevolence’s essence is like Heaven: Heaven covers all without exception;\nLike the sea: the sea contains all without exception;\nLike rain and dew: rain and dew nourish all without exception.\nCompassion, kindness, and pity—these are how benevolence is applied.\nIf one is not personally dear to all under Heaven, yet all under Heaven naturally hold them dear.\nThere is not a single person who does not receive their due,\nNor a single thing that does not attain its life.\nThe *Classic of Documents* says: *\"Even the birds and beasts, fish and turtles, are all as they should be.\"*\nThe *Book of Odes* says: *\"Thick the reeds grow along the path—let cattle and sheep not trample them.\"*\nThis is the utmost of benevolence.\n\nRighteousness is what is fitting for people—rewarding the good and punishing the evil to establish deeds and affairs.\nWhere principle resides is called righteousness.\nFollowing principle and making judgments in order—this is how righteousness is enacted.\nRewarding the good and punishing the evil are the principles of righteousness.\nEstablishing deeds and affairs are the judgments of righteousness.\n\nPropriety is what people tread upon—arising early and retiring late to fulfill the order of human relationships.\nPropriety is the act of treading.\nWhatever is trodden upon morning and evening without losing its order is propriety.\nIn speech, movement, sight, and hearing—even in sudden actions—where do licentiousness, eccentricity, or excess arise from?\nDesire is the foundation of being human; none of these five can be omitted.\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"When the Dao is lost, then virtue;\nWhen virtue is lost, then benevolence;\nWhen benevolence is lost, then righteousness;\nWhen righteousness is lost, then propriety.\"*\n*\"Lost\"* means dispersed.\nThe Dao disperses into virtue,\nVirtue disperses into benevolence,\nBenevolence disperses into righteousness,\nRighteousness disperses into propriety.\nThough the five never cease to serve one another,\nTheir essence remains undispersed—only the Dao’s subtlety preserves this.\n*Laozi* speaks of their essence, hence:\n*\"Propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trust, yet the beginning of chaos.\"*\nThe Yellow Stone Master speaks of their application, hence:\n*\"None can be omitted.\"*\n\nThe worthy and virtuous understand the ways of flourishing and decline,\nAre versed in the patterns of success and failure,\nDiscern the dynamics of order and chaos,\nAnd grasp the principles of retreat and advancement.\nFlourishing and decline have their Dao,\nSuccess and failure have their fate,\nOrder and chaos have their momentum,\nRetreat and advancement have their logic.\nThus, they retreat in seclusion, embracing the Dao,\nAwaiting their moment.\nThe Dao is like a boat;\nTime is like water.\nWith the advantage of a boat and oars but no river or sea to navigate,\nIts utility remains unseen.\nBut when the time arrives and they act,\nThey can attain the highest ranks of the realm;\nWhen the opportunity arises and they move,\nThey can achieve unparalleled deeds.\nIf they do not meet their moment, they perish in obscurity.\nIf their cultivation is profound and they act at the right time,\nTheir opportunity is swift—how could it be subject to deliberation?\nThus, their Dao is lofty, and their reputation endures through the ages.\nA lofty Dao ensures that their name grows heavier in later generations.\n\n**Chapter Two: On the Rectitude of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao cannot be said to be unrectified.\nVirtue is sufficient to win the distant—\n*\"Win\"* means the heart is pleased and sincerely submits.\nTrust is sufficient to unify the disparate,\nRighteousness is sufficient to gain the masses—\nIf one’s conduct and actions are fitting, the people will approve, and thus they will be gained.\nTalent is sufficient to discern antiquity,\nClarity is sufficient to illuminate those below—\nThis is the excellence of a person.\nConduct is sufficient to serve as a model,\nWisdom is sufficient to resolve doubts—\nAt moments of suspicion, only wisdom can judge.\nTrust can make one uphold agreements,\nIntegrity can make one distribute wealth fairly—\nThis is the prowess of a person.\nTo fulfill one’s duties without neglect—\nAs when Confucius served as a minor official overseeing fields.\nTo adhere to righteousness without yielding—\nWhen faced with profit and harm, resolutely upholding righteousness—this is not yielding.\nTo encounter suspicion without evading it improperly—\nThe Duke of Zhou did not avoid suspicion in his regency;\nThe Duke of Shao had suspicions;\nConfucius did not avoid seeing Lady Xi;\nZilu had suspicions.\nTo endure suspicion without evading it improperly—this is only for the most enlightened.\nTo encounter profit without seizing it improperly—\nThis is the excellence of a person.\n\nThe excellent are stern to others.\nThe prowessful are elevated above others.\nThe outstanding surpass others.\nThose with virtue, trust, righteousness, talent, and clarity—these are the deeds of the excellent.\nThose with conduct, wisdom, trust, and integrity—these are the deeds of the prowessful.\nAs for the outstanding, their talent and conduct suffice to name them.\nYet the outstanding surpass the prowessful,\nAnd the prowessful surpass the excellent.\n\n**Chapter Three: On Seeking a Person’s Aspirations**\n\nAspirations cannot be sought recklessly.\nCutting off desires and restraining appetites—\nThis is how burdens are removed.\n\nHuman nature is originally pure and tranquil, unencumbered by bonds.\nYet cravings and desires drag one away, ensnaring the self in external things.\nTo suppress and eliminate what is harmful—\nThis is how one atones for faults.\nTo atone means to sever and remove them entirely.\nOnly when suppression reaches its utmost and harm is utterly eliminated\nCan faults be fully atoned.\n\nTo abstain from wine and avoid licentiousness—\nThis is how one remains unstained.\nLicentiousness depletes vital essence, and when essence is exhausted, the spirit suffers.\nWine impairs the spirit, and when the spirit is injured, the essence is harmed.\nTo avoid suspicion and distance doubt—\nThis is how one avoids error.\nIf one’s path is without suspicion and one’s heart without doubt,\nThen affairs will not go awry.\n\nTo study extensively and question diligently—\nThis is how one broadens knowledge.\nTo possess the innate nature of sages and worthies yet fail to cultivate it through learning—\nThis is merely laziness.\n\nTo uphold lofty conduct and subtle speech—\nThis is how one refines oneself.\nConduct must be lofty yet unyielding; speech must be subtle yet not ostentatious.\n\nTo be reverent, frugal, modest, and restrained—\nThis is how one preserves oneself.\nTo deliberate deeply and plan far ahead—\nThis is how one avoids ruin.\nGuan Zhong’s strategies could unite the feudal lords,\nYet he faltered in the Way of the Sage-King.\nShang Yang’s strategies could strengthen a state,\nYet he faltered in benevolence and righteousness.\nHuan Kuan’s strategies could amass wealth,\nYet he faltered in nourishing the people.\nAll who meet ruin lack true calculation.\nTo associate with the virtuous and befriend the upright—\nThis is how one supports the faltering.\nThose who rejoice in praise cannot be true friends.\nTo practice forgiveness and cultivate sincerity—\nThis is how one interacts with others.\nTo embody the utmost clarity and yet adhere to the Middle Way—\nThis is how sages and worthies interact with others.\nThe utmost clarity belongs only to sages and worthies;\nThe Middle Way is what all people share.\n\nTo appoint the capable and employ the skilled—\nThis is how one accomplishes tasks.\nAdaptability is talent; utility is skill.\nThose with talent may be entrusted but not commanded;\nThose with skill may be commanded but not entrusted.\nThis is the natural progression in using people.\n\nTo censure vice and repel slander—\nThis is how one stops chaos.\nSlanderous speech and wicked deeds are the roots of disorder.\n\nTo examine antiquity and verify the present—\nThis is how one avoids confusion.\nBy following the progress of the ancients and inferring their intentions,\nOne may test the affairs of the present—how could there be confusion?\n\nTo establish standards first and measure afterward—\nThis is how one responds to emergencies.\nWith a single measure in hand, all lengths in the world are contained within it.\nWhen urgent matters arise and must be addressed without end,\nIt is because standards and measurements are fixed.\n\nTo adapt to changes and employ expedients—\nThis is how one resolves deadlocks.\nThere are fixed principles and flexible adaptations,\nFixed norms and expedient measures.\nWhen fixed principles cannot be applied,\nOne adjusts and returns to them.\nWhen fixed norms cannot be utilized,\nOne employs expedients and returns to them.\n\nTo restrain speech and conform to circumstances—\nThis is how one avoids blame.\nThe virtuous speak or remain silent according to the time,\nAct or withdraw according to the Way.\nThey restrain their words so their excellence is unseen,\nThey conform to circumstances so their intentions remain hidden—\nThus they avoid blame.\n\nTo be steadfast and unyielding—\nThis is how one achieves great deeds.\nTo be diligent and virtuous—\nThis is how one preserves one’s end.\n\nThe steadfast cannot be shaken;\nThe unyielding cannot be deflected.\nThe diligent are ever striving;\nThe virtuous are ever refining.\nTo achieve great deeds, nothing surpasses steadfastness;\nTo preserve one’s end, nothing surpasses avoiding fault.\n\n**Chapter Four: On the Foundation of Virtue and the Dao**\n\nThe foundation cannot be separated from virtue and the Dao.\nThe art of firm resolve and sincere action\nCannot be surpassed in breadth by extensive deliberation.\nDeliberation must be extensive.\nNothing is more secure than enduring insult.\nThe supreme Dao is vast and unobstructed—\nWhat insult could there be?\nNothing precedes virtue in cultivation.\nExternally, it perfects things;\nInternally, it perfects the self—\nThis is the cultivation of virtue.\n\nNothing brings greater joy than loving what is good.\nNothing is more divine than utmost sincerity.\nTo be without limits is to be divine.\nHuman divinity aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nYet one cannot match their divinity—\nFor one lacks utmost sincerity.\n\nNothing is clearer than comprehending things.\nThe *Records* say:\n*\"Clarity and purity within oneself,\nOne’s vital breath and spirit as divine.\"*\nThus, when all things come,\nHow could they evade your perception?\n\nNothing is more auspicious than contentment.\nThe auspiciousness of contentment is doubly auspicious.\nNothing is more bitter than excessive desires.\nThe Dao of the sage is serene and desireless.\nToward things, it responds when they come and does not cling when they depart—\nNever harboring desires.\nAmong the ancients with excessive desires,\nNone surpassed Qin Shi Huang and Han Wu.\nThey desired wealth for their states,\nStrength for their armies,\nGrandeur for their achievements,\nNobility for their names,\nSplendor for their palaces,\nBeauty for their consorts,\nSubmission for the barbarians,\nAnd immortality through alchemy.\nYet their states grew poorer,\nTheir armies weaker,\nTheir achievements humbler,\nTheir names duller,\nUntil finally they failed to obtain what they sought,\nLeaving behind only regret and humiliation—\nThis is the suffering of excessive desires.\nThose who govern states should certainly avoid excessive desires,\nBut for the virtuous in cultivating the self,\nHow could their restraint be insufficient?\n\nNothing is more sorrowful than scattered essence.\nWhat the Dao generates is called *One*.\nPurity is called *essence*.\nWhat essence emits is called *spirit*.\nIn its hidden state, it is without birth, without death,\nWithout before, without after,\nWithout yin, without yang,\nWithout motion, without stillness.\nIn its manifestation through form, it becomes\nClarity, wisdom, intelligence, and cognition.\nAll ranks of blood and qi receive it.\nWhen used correctly, it gathers and does not scatter;\nWhen used perversely, it scatters and does not gather.\nIf the eyes indulge in color, essence scatters through color;\nIf the ears indulge in sound, essence scatters through sound;\nIf the mouth indulges in flavor, essence scatters through flavor;\nIf the nose indulges in scent, essence scatters through scent.\nIf scattering continues unchecked,\nHow could it endure long?\n\nNothing is more ailment than instability.\nHeaven and Earth endure because they have constancy.\nIf humans lack constancy, is this not sickness?\n\nNothing is shorter than improper gain.\nWhat is obtained unjustly will surely be lost unjustly.\n\nNothing can be long-lasting if obtained improperly.\nNothing is more obscure than avarice and baseness—\nTo sacrifice one’s body for material things is the height of folly.\n\nNothing is more solitary than self-reliance—\nJie and Zhou of old trusted in their own talents,\nZhi Bo in his strength,\nXiang Yu in his courage,\nWang Mang in his cunning,\nYuan Zai and Lü Qi in their guile.\nSelf-reliance breeds arrogance in one’s **qi**, causing virtue to fail to enter the ears;\nIf virtue fails to enter, solitude and helplessness follow.\nWhen their downfall comes, the world competes to destroy them.\n\nNothing is more perilous than entrusting with doubt—\nHan doubted Han Xin yet employed him, and Xin nearly rebelled.\nTang doubted Li Huai Guang yet employed him, and Huai Guang ultimately turned traitor.\n\nNothing is more ruinous than excessive self-interest.\nRewards not given for merit, punishments not meted out for crimes,\nFavoring flatterers while hating the honest,\nNurturing kin while distancing the worthy—\nThe small leads to the resentment of individuals,\nThe great arouses the wrath of the world.\nThis is the path of self-interest’s destruction.\n\n**Chapter Five: Upholding Righteousness**\n\nTo follow and act upon righteousness is **Dao**.\nTo reveal wisdom outwardly brings darkness—\nThe **Dao** of the sages is inner clarity and outer obscurity.\nOnly those lacking in wisdom reveal it outwardly,\nAnd thus their **Dao** becomes obscured.\nIgnorance of one’s faults is a great veil—\nThe sage has no faults to acknowledge,\nThe worthy’s faults are manifest and thus understood.\nIgnorance of one’s faults, how profound is that blindness!\n\nThose who stray and do not return are ensnared—\nDrunkards know not the harm they do to their nature,\nLustful men know not the harm they do to their **qi**,\nThe greedy know not the harm they do to their resolve.\nHumans are born without delusion;\nIt is the ensnared who bring it upon themselves.\n\nTo invite calamity through speech is disaster—\nSpeak and act in harmony, and the **Dao** lies within while disaster rests with others;\nSpeak without acting, and the **Dao** lies with others while disaster rests within.\n\nOrders contrary to the heart are futile—\nThe heart issues commands, commands execute the heart.\nIf later contradicts earlier, destruction follows—\nInconstant decrees, a heart without trust, lead to abandoned affairs.\n\nAnger without authority invites transgression—\nKing Wen did not raise his voice or change his expression,\nYet the four quarters feared him.\nThus Confucius said:\n*\"The people fear not his anger, but the **Dao** of his ax and spear.\"*\n\nTo delight in humiliating others brings ruin—\nOne may seek a reputation for honesty,\nYet place others in positions of fault,\nAnd thus invite the path of calamity.\n\nTo dishonor those one employs brings peril—\nWhen a man is spoken of as lost,\nDanger follows close behind.\n\nTo disrespect those one should revere is ominous—\nBy age, it is the teeth;\nIn court, it is rank;\nAmong the worthy and unworthy, it is **virtue**.\nAll three may be revered—\nOutward respect is for teeth and rank,\nInner respect is for **virtue**.\n\nThose who outwardly conform yet inwardly diverge are solitary,\nThose who favor slander while distancing loyalty are doomed—\nSlanderers skillfully divine the ruler’s intent and strike true;\nLoyalists confront the ruler’s faults and remonstrate.\nThose who align with intent are often pleased,\nThose who oppose it are often enraged—\nThus, Zi Xu was slain and Wu fell,\nAnd Qu Yuan was exiled, leading to Chu’s ruin.\n\nTo draw near to vice while distancing the worthy is stupor—\nA woman’s audience in the public square brings chaos,\nAs seen in the calamities of Princess Taiping and Wei Shifu.\n\nTo appoint private individuals to office brings superficiality—\nShallow superficiality cannot bear the weight of high office,\nAs with the likes of Niu Jianke becoming Chancellor.\n\nTo overbear those below and seek victory is encroachment—\nWhen name fails to match reality, exhaustion follows.\nLu Zan said:\n*\"Name approaches the void, and thus is weighty in governance;\nProfit approaches reality, and thus is light in **virtue**.\nYet reality is the means to achieve name,\nName is the means to govern reality—\nWhen name and reality support each other, neither depletion nor scarcity will come.\"*\n\nTo neglect oneself while blaming others brings no resolution,\nTo enrich oneself while impoverishing others brings abandonment—\nThe sage always excels in saving others without abandoning them,\nIn nurturing things without discarding them.\nSelf-enrichment is self-satisfaction,\nNot the Confucian ideal of *\"cultivating one’s own virtue and benevolence.\"*\nTo enrich oneself while impoverishing others,\nAnd thus the talents of the people will be cast aside.\n\nTo reject merit for fault brings loss—\nWhen the multitude outwardly differs, ruin follows—\nMisplaced appointments, obstructed emotions,\nFlattery and private favor both advancing,\nEach with divergent hearts—\nSeeking survival without ruin is impossible.\nOnce employed but not trusted, one is estranged—\nTo employ the worthy yet distrust them,\nIs to lose their loyalty.\nThis is the *\"harm to the hegemon\"* of Guan Zhong.\n\nTo grant rewards with stingy demeanor brings discouragement—\nStinginess in rewards discourages the meritorious,\nAs with Xiang Yu’s *\"sparing the seal.\"*\nTo promise much yet give little breeds resentment—\nThe expectation is lost.\nTo welcome and then reject is discord—\nLiu Zhan welcomed Liu Bei yet turned him away.\nTo bestow lightly while expecting much brings no return—\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet treat all things as fodder for the slaughter;\nThe sage is not kind,\nYet treats the people as fodder for the slaughter.\nThey cover and bear them,\nNourish and give life to them—\nWhy demand they repay?\nTo prize nobility while forgetting humility brings no endurance—\nWhen the **Dao** suffices within oneself,\nNobility and humility cannot bring honor or shame.\nNobility is fixed, humility is fixed—\nOnly the petty man, suddenly elevated to high station,\nForgets his lowly origins,\nAnd thus his endurance is brief.\n\nTo dwell on past wrongs while discarding new merits is ominous—\nTo gnash one’s teeth over a grudge from a minor offense,\nOr to cherish a single meal’s kindness—\nThis is the measure of a common man.\nThose with resolve for the world,\nThough they harbor enmity from the past,\nWill employ them if their talents are great;\nThough they bear resentment from old scores,\nWill employ them if their merits are great.\nHan Gaozu ennobled Hou Yingyi,\nFor his merits.\nTang Taizong appointed Wei Zheng as Chancellor,\nFor his talents.\nTo employ men without proper alignment brings near-calamity—\nForced employment does not retain loyalty,\nAs with Cao Cao’s forced employment of Guan Yu,\nWho ultimately turned to Liu Bei—\nThis is the *\"not retaining\"* of it.\nTo choose officials for others brings chaos—\nTo lose what one is strong in brings weakness,\nFor there are those strong in **virtue**,\nThose strong in favor,\nThose strong in power,\nAnd those strong in arms.\n\nEmperor Yao and Shun ruled with **virtue** and grew strong,\nWhile Jie and Zhou lacked **virtue** and grew weak.\nTang and Wu flourished by gaining the people’s support and grew strong,\nWhile King You and King Li lost the people’s support and grew weak.\nThe Zhou Dynasty thrived by harnessing the power of the feudal lords and grew strong,\nBut lost that power and grew weak.\nThe Tang Dynasty prospered with its *fubing* (府兵) system and grew strong,\nYet lost it and grew weak.\nIn matters of governance, what is good strengthens,\nAnd what is evil weakens.\nIn personal conduct, innate nature strengthens,\nWhile emotions weaken.\n\nDecisions made by the unvirtuous are perilous—\nThe unvirtuous delight in others’ misfortune and rejoice in calamity.\nSecrets leaked in treachery lead to defeat,\nAnd excessive taxation with meager distribution brings decline.\n*Decline* means *eroded*—\nAs Master Wen Zhong said:\n*\"In lands where taxation is heavy,*\n*The treasury is likewise eroded.\"*\n\nWhen soldiers are impoverished and courtiers grow rich, the state decays—\nCourtiers fan the flames of intrigue, hoping for chaos in the land.\nSoldiers risk their lives, defending the borders against peril.\nIf wealth flows to one while another starves, military strength wanes.\n\nWhen bribery is openly practiced, justice is obscured—\nPrivate usurps public, crooked distorts straight.\nTo dismiss good counsel while remembering faults breeds tyranny—\nTyranny breeds resentment.\nTo entrust the unworthy and trust the unworthy brings corruption—\n*Corruption* means *drought*—\nThose who govern with **virtue** gather the people,\nWhile those who rule with harsh laws scatter them.\n*Law* originates from moral intent, with compassion at its core.\nThus, the sage kings supplemented **virtue** with law,\nNot relying solely on punishment.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"Govern with **virtue** and the people unite,\nRule with harsh laws and they scatter.\"*\n\nIf minor merits go unrewarded, great achievements will not stand.\nIf small grievances are not pardoned, great resentment will arise.\nRewards that do not win hearts, punishments that do not meet justice, breed rebellion—\nWhen the people’s hearts are not won, rebellion follows.\nRewarding the unworthy, punishing the innocent, is cruelty—\nCruelty is what should not be imposed.\n\nTo heed slander and praise it, to hear counsel and resent it, leads to ruin.\nHe who holds what is his own is secure,\nWhile the greedy who covet others’ possessions bring ruin.\nTo possess what is rightfully yours brings ease and stability—\nThis is the *Anli* chapter’s sixth principle.\nResentment stems from unforgiven minor offenses,\nCalamity arises from unprepared planning.\nFortune comes from accumulated goodness,\nDisaster from accumulated evil.\nGoodness accumulated brings fortune,\nEvil accumulated brings disaster.\nWithout goodness or evil, there is neither fortune nor disaster.\n\nHunger arises from neglecting agriculture,\nCold from idleness in weaving.\nSecurity comes from having the right people,\nPeril from losing the worthy.\n\nWealth comes from welcoming prosperity—\nThe frugality of Emperor Yao, Li Kui’s land reforms,\nKing Goujian’s decade of preparation, and Han’s *pingzhen* system\nAll were means to invite abundance.\nPoverty comes from squandering opportunity.\n\nWhen the ruler lacks constancy in policy,\nThe people grow suspicious.\nUnstable temperaments—\nUnchecked anger and joy—\nFuel mutual distrust, leaving none at ease.\nDisrespecting superiors invites punishment,\nInsulting inferiors invites estrangement.\nDisrespecting superiors is

plucking a hair.\"*\n\nSelf-doubt breeds mistrust—\nThis is *obscurity*.\nSelf-confidence without mistrust—\nThis is *clarity*.\nThe misguided lack true friends—\nLi Fengji’s associates were the likes of Bajuan and Shiliuzi.\nA crooked superior breeds a crooked subordinate—\nYuan Di’s ministers were Honggong and Shixian.\nA declining state lacks the worthy,\nA chaotic polity lacks the virtuous.\nIt is not that the worthy and virtuous do not exist—\nThey cannot be employed.\n\nThose who love deeply seek the worthy with urgency,\nAnd those who delight in the worthy nourish the people well.\nPeople cannot love themselves—\nThey rely on the worthy to love them.\nPeople cannot nourish themselves—\nThey rely on the worthy to nourish them.\nWhen a state is poised to dominate,\nThe worthy all flock to it—\nZhao killed Wuyu, so the Master turned back at the river.\nWhen a state is doomed to fall,\nThe worthy flee first—\nAs Miczi left Shang, and Confucius left Lu.\n\nBarren lands do not yield great crops,\nShallow waters do not hold great fish.\nBare trees do not shelter great birds,\nSparse forests do not harbor great beasts.\nThese four things illustrate:\nWhen people are shallow, there is no **virtue**,\nWhen a state is shallow, there are no loyal and worthy.\n\nTall mountains crumble from below,\nFull marshes overflow.\nThese two things warn against excess—\nExcessive height and excessive fullness.\n\nTo discard jade for stone is blindness—\nThe sighted and the blind are the same.\nA tiger’s skin over a lamb’s nature brings shame—\nFine appearance without substance is as good as none.\nClothing without a collar sags downward,\nRunning without watching the ground leads to a fall.\nWeak pillars cause the house to collapse,\nWeak ministers cause the state to topple.\n*Weakness* means insufficient strength for the task.\n\nCold feet harm the heart—\nPeople’s grievances harm the state.\nThe harmonious *qi* of the feet rises to govern the limbs,\nWhile the heart reigns as sovereign.\nWhen *qi* is harmonious, the sovereign’s heart is at ease,\nWhen *qi* is discordant, the sovereign’s heart is injured.\n\nBefore mountains crumble, the base weakens

who fear peril find security,\nThose who fear ruin find survival.\n\nWhat mortals pursue,\nIf aligned with the Dao brings fortune,\nIf contrary to the Dao brings calamity.\nThe fortunate are where a

resist;\nto rectify oneself while transforming others is to follow.\nThe teacher relies on words,\nthe transformer relies on the Dao/Way.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and robbers multiply.\"*\nThis is the resistance of teaching.\n\n*\"I act without doing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\nThis is the following of transformation.\n\nResistance is hard to follow,\nfollowing is easy to enact;\nhard to follow leads to chaos,\neasy to enact brings order.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is simple and easy—\nso too the Dao/Way of the Sage.\n\nFollow the sun and moon to mark day and night,\nfollow yin and yang to govern life and death,\nfollow mountains and rivers to shape high and low—\nthis is the simplicity of Heaven and Earth.\n\nFollow the barbarians by keeping them at bay,\nfollow the Central States by embracing them,\nfollow the virtuous by ennobling them,\nfollow the petty by employing them,\nfollow good and evil by rewarding and punishing,\nfollow the customs of the Nine Regions in taxation,\nfollow human relationships in their proper order—\nthis is the

threaded through its nose\nand a three-foot rope bound its neck,\neven a child could lead it.\n\nThe wind sweeps across the great marshes unrestrained—\nit is because its course follows the natural order.\n\nThus may one govern the body, the family, the state—\nthe principle is one, though the scale differs.\n\nThe *Huangshi Gong*’s *Su Shu* concludes.\n\nThis fivefold principle is called **\"employing them according to their talents.\"**\n\n#27 *\"Xiao Liangdi\"* (蕭良娣), the *Siku Quanshu* version reads *\"Zhang Liangdi\"* (張良娣).\n#28 The *Siku Quanshu* version omits the phrase *\"five sounds\"* (五聲).\n#30 The *Daozang* version originally lacked the character *\"xing\"* (行); now restored according to meaning and the *Siku Quanshu* version.\n\n#31 *\"Thus\"* (如此), the *Siku Quanshu*

      "translated_text": "**Ah! How grave and weighty this is.**\n\nThe Yellow Stone Master obtained *Essentials of the Dao* (Sūshū) and transmitted it to Jiāng Zǐfáng, yet Jiāng Zǐfáng did not fully grasp its teachings and thus buried it. Five hundred years later, bandits unearthed it, and from then on, *Essentials of the Dao* began to circulate among mortals. Yet what was transmitted was merely the Yellow Stone Master’s words, and can his intent truly be exhausted by speech?\n\nI have often reflected: the Dao/Way of Heaven and humanity has never ceased to mutually benefit one another, and the ancient sages all devoted their hearts to it. Yáo revered the Heavenly Vault (Hào Tiān), Shùn harmonized the Seven Celestial Administrations (Qī Zhèng), Yǔ honored the Nine Regions (Jiǔ Chóu), and the sage Fùyuē expounded the Heavenly Dao. Wén Wáng emphasized the Eight Trigrams (Bā Guà), Zhōu Gōng established the Heavenly and Earthly Four Seasons’ Offices (Sìshí Guān), and further appointed the Three Ministers (Sān Gōng) to reconcile the balance of yin and yang. Kǒngzǐ sought to transcend words, while Lǎozǐ grounded it in the eternal and boundless (Cháng Wúyǒu).\n\nThe *Yīn Fú Jīng* (Scripture of the Yin Symbol) states:\n*\"The cosmos lies within the palm, all transformations arise from the body. When the Dao reaches this level, even ghosts and spirits cannot evade my mastery—how much more so the matters of punitive governance and measures!\"*\n\nThe Yellow Stone Master was a reclusive sage of the Qín. His words are concise, his meaning profound—even the sages Yáo, Shùn, Yǔ, Wén Wáng, Fùyuē, Zhōu Gōng, Kǒngzǐ, and Lǎozǐ could not surpass this. Thus, the Yellow Stone Master, knowing that the Qín would fall and the Hàn would rise, entrusted this book to Jiāng Zǐfáng. Yet could Jiāng Zǐfáng truly comprehend its entirety? His mastery was but partial, applying only a few of its precepts.\n\nThe book says: *\"Cunning schemes leaked to the outside lead to ruin.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor (Gāo Dì) to honor Hàn Xìn.\nThe book says: *\"Small grudges are unforgivable; great grudges must be resolved.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor to grant titles to Yōng Yì.\nThe book says: *\"Decisions made by the unvirtuous are perilous.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor to abandon the封封 (fēngfēng) of the Six Kingdoms.\nThe book says: *\"Deploying stratagems and exercising authority resolves deadlocks.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, summoning the Four Worthies (Sì Hào) to establish the Emperor Huì.\nThe book says: *\"No greater fortune exists than contentment.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, choosing to remain and封封 (fēngfēng) himself.\nThe book says: *\"Severing desires and restraining appetites removes burdens.\"* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, abandoning worldly affairs and following Chìsōngzǐ.\n\nAlas! Though he discarded its dross and sediment, Jiāng Zǐfáng’s partial use was still enough to destroy the Qín and the Yǐng, while establishing the Emperor of Pèi. How much greater the effects would have been if he had applied it fully and delved into its depths!\n\nSince the Hàn dynasty, the study of章章 (zhāngzhāng) exegesis and文词 (wéncí) rhetoric has flourished, yet those who truly grasp the Dao have grown exceedingly rare. Figures like Zhēng Zhūliè, Wáng Měng, Fáng Qiáo, and Kuī Dù, though hailed as eminent ministers of their time, never truly understood the grand Dao of the ancient kings. This is why *Essentials of the Dao* was forbidden to transmission to those **not aligned with the Dao**, **not attuned to the sacred**, **not reverent of the Holy**, or **not virtuous**.\n\nThe Dao is the interplay of presence and absence (Lí Yǒu Lí Wú); the sacred is the transcendence of fixed definitions (Fēi Yǒu Fēi Wú); reverence for the Holy is the mastery of presence within absence (Yǒu Ér Wú); and virtue is the cultivation of absence within presence (Wú Ér Yǒu). Without these four qualities, even if one recites this book by rote, they cannot truly embody its teachings.\n\nThe *Preface of Heavenly Awakening* by Zhāng Shāngyīng. #1 *The original lacks a title; this one is supplied based on the text’s headings.*\n\n**Yellow Stone Master’s *Essentials of the Dao* (Sūshū) – Annotated by Zhāng Shāngyīng of the Sòng dynasty.**",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One: On the Origin of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao cannot be said to have a beginning.\nDao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—these five are one in essence.\nSeparated in application, they become five; unified in essence, they return to one.\nOne unifies the five; the five manifest the one.\nThe Dao is what people tread upon, yet it is such that all things are unaware of its path.\nThe Dao’s influence pervades all things—vast and great.\nA single breath, a single word, a single movement or stillness, a single act of eating or drinking—whether in the grandness beyond the eight strings of the *qín* or the minutiae within the dust of the *mángyè* plant—where is there that is not the Dao?\n\nBenevolence is insufficient to name it, so the benevolent see it and call it benevolence.\nWisdom is insufficient to exhaust it, so the wise see it and call it wisdom.\nThe common folk are insufficient to perceive it, so it is said: *\"It is used, yet they know not.\"*\n\nVirtue is what people attain, allowing all things to fulfill their desires.\nDesire is what is sought.\nIf one seeks and does not attain, it is not the utmost of virtue.\nTo seek from the compass and square, one attains only the square and the circle.\nTo seek from the scales, one attains only lightness and heaviness.\nBut to seek from virtue—there is no desire that is not fulfilled:\nSovereign and minister, father and son attain it and thus become sovereign and minister, father and son;\nInsects and grasses attain it and thus become insects and grasses.\nThe great become great through it, the small become small through it.\nNearly, it encompasses the self; distantly, it encompasses all things.\nThere is no desire that is not fulfilled.\n\nBenevolence is what people hold dear—possessing compassion, kindness, and pity to nurture life’s fulfillment.\nBenevolence’s essence is like Heaven: Heaven covers all without exception;\nLike the sea: the sea contains all without exception;\nLike rain and dew: rain and dew nourish all without exception.\nCompassion, kindness, and pity—these are how benevolence is applied.\nIf one is not personally dear to all under Heaven, yet all under Heaven naturally hold them dear.\nThere is not a single person who does not receive their due,\nNor a single thing that does not attain its life.\nThe *Classic of Documents* says: *\"Even the birds and beasts, fish and turtles, are all as they should be.\"*\nThe *Book of Odes* says: *\"Thick the reeds grow along the path—let cattle and sheep not trample them.\"*\nThis is the utmost of benevolence.\n\nRighteousness is what is fitting for people—rewarding the good and punishing the evil to establish deeds and affairs.\nWhere principle resides is called righteousness.\nFollowing principle and making judgments in order—this is how righteousness is enacted.\nRewarding the good and punishing the evil are the principles of righteousness.\nEstablishing deeds and affairs are the judgments of righteousness.\n\nPropriety is what people tread upon—arising early and retiring late to fulfill the order of human relationships.\nPropriety is the act of treading.\nWhatever is trodden upon morning and evening without losing its order is propriety.\nIn speech, movement, sight, and hearing—even in sudden actions—where do licentiousness, eccentricity, or excess arise from?\nDesire is the foundation of being human; none of these five can be omitted.\n*Laozi* says:\n*\"When the Dao is lost, then virtue;\nWhen virtue is lost, then benevolence;\nWhen benevolence is lost, then righteousness;\nWhen righteousness is lost, then propriety.\"*\n*\"Lost\"* means dispersed.\nThe Dao disperses into virtue,\nVirtue disperses into benevolence,\nBenevolence disperses into righteousness,\nRighteousness disperses into propriety.\nThough the five never cease to serve one another,\nTheir essence remains undispersed—only the Dao’s subtlety preserves this.\n*Laozi* speaks of their essence, hence:\n*\"Propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trust, yet the beginning of chaos.\"*\nThe Yellow Stone Master speaks of their application, hence:\n*\"None can be omitted.\"*\n\nThe worthy and virtuous understand the ways of flourishing and decline,\nAre versed in the patterns of success and failure,\nDiscern the dynamics of order and chaos,\nAnd grasp the principles of retreat and advancement.\nFlourishing and decline have their Dao,\nSuccess and failure have their fate,\nOrder and chaos have their momentum,\nRetreat and advancement have their logic.\nThus, they retreat in seclusion, embracing the Dao,\nAwaiting their moment.\nThe Dao is like a boat;\nTime is like water.\nWith the advantage of a boat and oars but no river or sea to navigate,\nIts utility remains unseen.\nBut when the time arrives and they act,\nThey can attain the highest ranks of the realm;\nWhen the opportunity arises and they move,\nThey can achieve unparalleled deeds.\nIf they do not meet their moment, they perish in obscurity.\nIf their cultivation is profound and they act at the right time,\nTheir opportunity is swift—how could it be subject to deliberation?\nThus, their Dao is lofty, and their reputation endures through the ages.\nA lofty Dao ensures that their name grows heavier in later generations.\n\n**Chapter Two: On the Rectitude of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao cannot be said to be unrectified.\nVirtue is sufficient to win the distant—\n*\"Win\"* means the heart is pleased and sincerely submits.\nTrust is sufficient to unify the disparate,\nRighteousness is sufficient to gain the masses—\nIf one’s conduct and actions are fitting, the people will approve, and thus they will be gained.\nTalent is sufficient to discern antiquity,\nClarity is sufficient to illuminate those below—\nThis is the excellence of a person.\nConduct is sufficient to serve as a model,\nWisdom is sufficient to resolve doubts—\nAt moments of suspicion, only wisdom can judge.\nTrust can make one uphold agreements,\nIntegrity can make one distribute wealth fairly—\nThis is the prowess of a person.\nTo fulfill one’s duties without neglect—\nAs when Confucius served as a minor official overseeing fields.\nTo adhere to righteousness without yielding—\nWhen faced with profit and harm, resolutely upholding righteousness—this is not yielding.\nTo encounter suspicion without evading it improperly—\nThe Duke of Zhou did not avoid suspicion in his regency;\nThe Duke of Shao had suspicions;\nConfucius did not avoid seeing Lady Xi;\nZilu had suspicions.\nTo endure suspicion without evading it improperly—this is only for the most enlightened.\nTo encounter profit without seizing it improperly—\nThis is the excellence of a person.\n\nThe excellent are stern to others.\nThe prowessful are elevated above others.\nThe outstanding surpass others.\nThose with virtue, trust, righteousness, talent, and clarity—these are the deeds of the excellent.\nThose with conduct, wisdom, trust, and integrity—these are the deeds of the prowessful.\nAs for the outstanding, their talent and conduct suffice to name them.\nYet the outstanding surpass the prowessful,\nAnd the prowessful surpass the excellent.\n\n**Chapter Three: On Seeking a Person’s Aspirations**\n\nAspirations cannot be sought recklessly.\nCutting off desires and restraining appetites—\nThis is how burdens are removed.",

be fully atoned.\n\nTo abstain from wine and avoid licentiousness—\nThis is how one remains unstained.\nLicentiousness depletes vital essence, and when essence is exhausted, the spirit suffers.\nWine impairs the spirit, and when the spirit is injured, the essence is harmed.\nTo avoid suspicion and distance doubt—\nThis is how one avoids error.\nIf one’s path is without suspicion and one’s heart without doubt,\nThen affairs will not go awry.\n\nTo study extensively and question diligently—\nThis is how one broadens knowledge.\nTo possess the innate nature of sages and worthies yet fail to cultivate it through learning—\nThis is merely laziness.\n\nTo uphold lofty conduct and subtle speech—\nThis is how one refines oneself.\nConduct must be lofty yet unyielding; speech must be subtle yet not ostentatious.\n\nTo be reverent, frugal, modest, and restrained—\nThis is how one preserves oneself.\nTo deliberate deeply and plan far ahead—\nThis is how one avoids ruin.\nGuan Zhong’s

Kuan’s strategies could amass wealth,\nYet he faltered in nourishing the people.\nAll who meet ruin lack true calculation.\nTo associate with the virtuous and befriend the upright—\nThis is how one supports the faltering.\nThose who rejoice in praise cannot be true friends.\nTo practice forgiveness and cultivate sincerity—\nThis is how one interacts with others.\nTo embody the utmost clarity and yet adhere to the Middle Way—\nThis is how sages and worthies interact with others.\nThe utmost clarity belongs only to sages and worthies;\nThe Middle Way is what all people share.\n\nTo appoint the capable and employ the skilled—\nThis is how one accomplishes tasks.\nAdaptability is talent; utility is skill.\nThose with talent may be entrusted but not commanded;\nThose with skill may be commanded but not entrusted.\nThis is the natural progression in using people.\n\nTo censure vice and repel slander—\nThis is how one stops chaos.\nSlanderous speech and wicked deeds are the roots of disorder.\n\nTo examine antiquity and verify the present—\nThis is how one avoids confusion.\nBy following the progress of the ancients and inferring their intentions,\nOne may test the affairs of the present—how could there be confusion?\n\nTo establish standards first and measure afterward—\nThis is how one responds to emergencies.\nWith a single measure in hand, all lengths in the world are contained within it.\nWhen urgent matters arise and must be addressed without end,\nIt is because standards and measurements are fixed.\n\nTo adapt to changes and employ expedients—\nThis is how one resolves deadlocks.\nThere are fixed principles and flexible adaptations,\nFixed norms and expedient measures.\nWhen fixed principles cannot be applied,\nOne adjusts and returns to them.\nWhen fixed norms cannot be utilized,\nOne employs expedients and returns to them.\n\nTo restrain speech and conform to circumstances—\nThis is how one avoids blame.\nThe virtuous speak or remain silent according to the time,\nAct or withdraw according to the Way.\nThey restrain their words so their excellence is unseen,\nThey conform to circumstances so their intentions remain hidden—\nThus they avoid blame.\n\nTo be steadfast and unyielding—\nThis is how one achieves great deeds.\nTo be diligent and virtuous—\nThis is how one preserves one’s end.\n\nThe steadfast cannot be shaken;\nThe unyielding

fault.\n\n**Chapter Four: On the Foundation of Virtue and the Dao**\n\nThe foundation cannot be separated from virtue and the Dao.\nThe art of firm resolve and sincere action\nCannot be surpassed in breadth by extensive deliberation.\nDeliberation must be extensive.\nNothing is more secure than enduring insult.\nThe supreme Dao is vast and unobstructed—\nWhat insult could there be?\nNothing precedes virtue in cultivation.\nExternally, it perfects things;\nInternally, it perfects the self—\nThis is the cultivation of virtue.\n\nNothing brings greater joy than loving what is good.\nNothing is more divine than utmost sincerity.\nTo be without limits is to be divine.\nHuman divinity aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nYet one cannot match their divinity—\nFor one lacks utmost sincerity.\n\nNothing is clearer than comprehending things.\nThe *Records* say:\n*\"Clarity and purity within oneself,\nOne’s vital breath and spirit as divine.\"*\nThus, when all things come,\nHow could they evade your perception?\n\nNothing is more auspicious than contentment.\nThe auspiciousness of contentment is doubly auspicious.\nNothing is more bitter than excessive desires.\nThe Dao of the sage is serene and desireless.\nToward things, it responds when they come and does not cling when they depart—\nNever harboring desires.\nAmong the ancients with excessive desires,\nNone surpassed Qin Shi Huang and Han Wu.\nThey desired wealth for their states,\nStrength for their armies,\nGrandeur for their achievements,\nNobility for their names,\nSplendor for their palaces,\nBeauty for their consorts,\nSubmission for the barbarians,\nAnd immortality through alchemy.\nYet their states grew poorer,\nTheir armies weaker,\nTheir achievements humbler,\nTheir names duller,\nUntil finally they failed to obtain what they sought,\nLeaving behind only regret and humiliation—\nThis is the suffering of excessive desires.\nThose who govern states should certainly avoid excessive desires,\nBut for

scatter;\nWhen used perversely, it scatters and does not gather.\nIf the eyes indulge in color, essence scatters through color;\nIf the ears indulge in sound, essence scatters through sound;\nIf the mouth indulges in flavor, essence scatters through flavor;\nIf the nose indulges in scent, essence scatters through scent.\nIf scattering continues unchecked,\nHow could it endure long?\n\nNothing is

hating the honest,\nNurturing kin while distancing the worthy—\nThe small leads to the resentment of individuals,\nThe great arouses the wrath of the world.\nThis is the path of self-interest’s destruction.\n\n**Chapter Five: Upholding Righteousness**\n\nTo follow and act upon righteousness is **Dao**.\nTo reveal wisdom outwardly brings darkness—\nThe **Dao** of the sages is inner clarity and outer obscurity.\nOnly those lacking in wisdom reveal it outwardly,\nAnd thus their **Dao** becomes obscured.\nIgnorance of one’s faults is a great veil—\nThe sage has no faults to acknowledge,\nThe worthy’s faults are manifest and thus understood.\nIgnorance of one’s faults, how profound is that blindness!\n\nThose who stray and do not return are ensnared—\nDrunkards know not the harm they do to their nature,\nLustful men know not the harm they do to their **qi**,\nThe greedy know not the harm they do to their resolve.\nHumans are born without delusion;\nIt is the ensnared who bring it upon themselves.\n\nTo invite calamity through speech is disaster—\nSpeak and act in harmony, and the **Dao** lies within while disaster rests with others;\nSpeak without acting, and the **Dao** lies with others while disaster rests within.\n\nOrders contrary to the heart are futile—\nThe heart issues commands, commands execute the heart.\nIf later contradicts earlier, destruction follows—\nInconstant decrees, a heart without trust, lead to abandoned affairs.\n\nAnger without authority invites transgression—\nKing Wen did not raise his voice or change his expression,\nYet the four quarters feared him.\nThus Confucius said:\n*\"The people fear not his anger, but the **Dao** of his ax and spear.\"*\n\nTo delight in humiliating others brings ruin—\nOne may seek a reputation for honesty,\nYet place others in positions of fault,\nAnd thus invite the path of calamity.\n\nTo dishonor those one employs brings peril—\nWhen a man is spoken of as lost,\nDanger follows close behind.\n\nTo disrespect those one should revere is ominous—\nBy age, it is the teeth;\nIn court, it is rank;\nAmong the worthy and unworthy, it is **virtue**.\nAll three may be revered—\nOutward respect is for teeth and rank,\nInner respect is for **virtue**.\n\nThose who outwardly conform yet inwardly diverge are solitary,\nThose who favor slander while distancing loyalty are doomed—\nSlanderers skillfully divine the ruler’s intent and strike true;\nLoyalists confront the ruler’s faults and remonstrate.\nThose who align with intent are often pleased,\nThose who oppose it are often enraged—\nThus, Zi Xu was slain and Wu fell,\nAnd Qu Yuan was exiled, leading to Chu’s ruin.\n\nTo draw near to vice while distancing the worthy is stupor—\nA woman’s audience in the public square brings chaos,\nAs seen in the calamities of Princess Taiping and Wei Shifu.\n\nTo appoint private individuals to office brings superficiality—\nShallow superficiality cannot bear the weight of high office,\nAs with the likes of Niu Jianke becoming Chancellor.\n\nTo overbear those below and seek victory is encroachment—\nWhen name fails to match reality, exhaustion follows.\nLu Zan said:\n*\"Name approaches the void, and thus is weighty in governance;\nProfit approaches reality, and thus is light in **virtue**.\nYet reality is the means to achieve name,\nName is the means to

impoverishing others brings abandonment—\nThe sage always excels in saving others without abandoning them,\nIn nurturing things without discarding them.\nSelf-enrichment is self-satisfaction,\nNot the Confucian ideal of *\"cultivating one’s own virtue and benevolence.\"*\nTo enrich oneself while impoverishing others,\nAnd thus the talents of the people will be cast aside.\n\nTo reject merit for fault brings loss—\nWhen the multitude outwardly differs, ruin follows—\nMisplaced appointments, obstructed emotions,\nFlattery and private favor both advancing,\nEach with divergent hearts—\nSeeking survival without ruin is impossible.\nOnce employed but not trusted, one is estranged—\nTo employ the worthy yet distrust them,\nIs to lose their loyalty.\nThis is the *\"harm to the hegemon\"* of Guan Zhong.\n\nTo grant rewards with stingy demeanor brings discouragement—\nStinginess in rewards discourages the meritorious,\nAs with Xiang Yu’s *\"sparing the seal.\"*\nTo promise much yet give little breeds resentment—\nThe expectation is lost.\nTo welcome and then reject is discord—\nLiu Zhan welcomed Liu Bei yet turned him away.\nTo bestow lightly while expecting much brings no return—\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet treat all things as fodder for the slaughter;\nThe sage is not kind,\nYet treats the people as fodder for the slaughter.\nThey cover and bear them,\nNourish and give life to them—\nWhy demand they repay?\nTo prize nobility while forgetting humility brings no endurance—\nWhen the **Dao** suffices within oneself,\nNobility and humility cannot bring honor or shame.\nNobility is fixed, humility is fixed—\nOnly the petty man, suddenly elevated to high station,\nForgets his lowly origins,\nAnd thus his endurance is brief.\n\nTo dwell on past wrongs while discarding new merits is ominous—\nTo gnash one’s teeth over a grudge from a minor offense,\nOr to cherish a single meal’s kindness—\nThis is the measure of a common man.\nThose with
