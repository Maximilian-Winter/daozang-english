Also known as *The Kinship of the Three in Accordance with the Zhouyi: Textual Variants* or *Annotations on the Kinship of the Three in Accordance with the Zhouyi*. Compiled by Zhu Xi of the Song dynasty. The base text includes supplementary notes by Huang Ruijie, a later scholar of Luling. Three fascicles. Base text source: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Supreme Mystery Section. Collated with the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* edition, Subsection of Daoist Works under the Classics Division (hereafter *Siku* edition).\n\n---\n\n### *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One\n**Supplementary Notes by Huang Ruijie of Luling**\n\n#### **Upper Chapter**\nQian and Kun are the gate and portal of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams. When speaking of Qian and Kun in relation to the cosmos, Qian (Heaven) is above and Kun (Earth) below, with all things between them. Kun’s yin is below, completing the cycle—this is the gate and portal of the *Yi*. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li as the enclosing frame, with Qian’s form as the northern inquiry. Through the transformations of yin and yang, when speaking of the human body, all things begin and end with Qian’s yang above, while the yin and yang of the body and the transformations of the myriad things all occur within it. Thus, Qian and Kun are the parents of all hexagrams, all pointing to the transformations of yin and yang. This is what is called the great elixir of golden cinnabar. Its furnace and crucible, then, are Kan and the enclosing frame, which turn the hub and align the axle. Kun occupies the positions above and below, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them—this is the *Yi*. The positions of the primordial Heaven are: Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, and Kan in the west. Thus, their image is like a walled enclosure; their ascent and descent are like an axle piercing the hub to turn the wheel, descending once and ascending once. The hub is solid on the outside to hold the spokes, while the crossbar beneath the carriage, passing through the hub at both ends to receive the linchpin, is Kun. The heart of the carriage wheel, hollow within to receive the axle, is Qian. The axle is the interlocking of the four trigrams of the female and male. The female and male refer to the four paired trigrams: Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen. The *qi* is the sack, and the *yue* is its tube. In the method of *na jia*, Qian is the full moon, Kun is the new moon, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them. Zhen governs the waxing light, Dui the first quarter; Xun governs the waning light, Gen the last quarter—like the tension and release of a drum’s strap.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Shaozi remarked, “Qian and Kun establish the positions above and below; Kan and Li arrange the gates to the left and right.” The hexagram positions in the *Cantong Qi* are all of the same principle. They encompass the Dao of yin and yang, like a skilled charioteer who holds the reins and bit, follows the inked line, and adheres to the wheel tracks. By abiding in the center to govern the external, the calculations are recorded in the pitch pipes and calendar. This speaks of the human heart’s ability to govern yin and yang, turning the hub and axle to refine the elixir. The reins and bit are what regulate yin and yang; the inked line refers to the firing times; the wheel tracks indicate the paths of ascent and descent; the center is the heart; the external is qi; and the calculations refer to the sixty hexagrams’ firing times below.\n\nThe lunar phases have five or six divisions; warp and weft serve the sun’s command. Combined, they make sixty, with firm and yielding having inner and outer aspects. The moon takes five days as one phase, six phases as one cycle. Combining day and night makes sixty, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams. Day is firm, night is yielding; firm is the inner, yielding the outer. Among the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—which serve as the furnace, crucible, elixir, and firing times—only sixty hexagrams remain.\n\nAt dawn, *Zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *Meng* receives its turn. Each day and night governs one hexagram, used in proper sequence. This is the general pattern of the sixty hexagrams. One month completes one cycle, referring to the timing of daily practice at dawn and dusk. From *Ji Ji* to *Wei Ji* until the break of dawn, the end returns to a new beginning. The celestial stems and branches set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late. *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* refer to the hexagrams of the dark moon: *Ji Ji* at dawn and *Wei Ji* at dusk. *Shuang* refers to the time of waxing light.\n\nSpring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. Autumn and winter employ the outer, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Spring and summer refer to dawn; autumn and winter to dusk. The inner body refers to the preceding hexagram; the outer to the following hexagram. This is also part of the pattern of the sixty hexagrams. In the later chapter, *Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*, while *Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*, fully expounding the *na jia* method. Generally, the times used in a single day are merely the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The line statements contain benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accordance with the seasons. Thus, in harmony with the four seasons, the five phases attain their proper order. This speaks of the differences in practice between dawn and dusk, though the details remain unclear.\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and Earth are Qian and Kun. Establishing positions refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang’s pairings. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. This cites the *Yi* and explains it to clarify the functions of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—speaking of Qian above and Kun below, Li descending and Kan ascending. The two functions of Qian and Kun refer to Qian’s use of nine and Kun’s use of six. Nine is old yang; six is old yin. The two functions have no fixed line positions, circulating through the six voids. Their coming and going neither ascend nor descend, nor do they have constancy. Hidden and submerged, they rise and fall within. They envelop the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao. By the insubstantial governing the substantial, the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness. Thus, in tracing waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish and perish. Qian and Kun’s two hexagrams have six lines: nine, “use nine,” and “use six” have no fixed positions. Each of the six has its position, yet the nine and six of the six lines are the circulation and ascent-descent of these nine and six.\n\nThe method involves Qian receiving *jia* and *ren*, Kun receiving *yi*, *gui*, and *geng*, while Xun receives *xin* in ascent and descent. Knowing that vessels have form, Gen receives *bing*, and Dui receives *ding* in their positions. Kan receives *wu*, and Li receives *ji*, for the yin and yang of the six hexagrams. Thus, by this primal [principle], only Zhen’s reception of *jia* has a fixed position, while all else has none. This is the circulation of the middle lines of Kan and Li, governing the substantial through the insubstantial; their function lies precisely in the emptiness of form. This aligns with the *Laozi*’s saying of \"hollowing out clay to make a vessel,\" where the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.\n\nThe waxing of *xiao-xi* passes through Zhen and Dui to culminate in Qian; its waning begins in Kun and moves through Xun and Gen to culminate in Kun. Their vanishing is the absence of position. The later passage on \"use nine\" in fluttering succession, as the ancestral teaching of the *Yi*, carries this same meaning.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Someone asked whether the *Cantong Qi* was originally the *Longhu Shangjing*. He replied: Not so. Later scholars, seeing that Wei Boyang’s transmission mentioned a *Longhu Shangjing*, fabricated this text. Most of it is cobbled together from the *Cantong Qi*’s phrases, though some explanations are mistaken. For instance, the \"two functions\" refer to \"use nine\" and \"use six,\" where nine and six are also Kan and Li. The \"six voids\" are the six line positions of Qian and Kun—initial, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top. Though the two functions have no fixed line positions, they constantly circulate through the six lines of Qian and Kun, like the essence and *qi* of a person, ascending and descending throughout the body without fixed abode. The *Longhu Jing*, however, mistakenly equates this with the voids of *Xu* and *Wei*, grasping at straws to force a connection.\n\nAccording to Peng’s account, Wei Gong obtained the *Guwen Longhu Jing* and mistook it for the *Cantong Qi*. Master Zhu, however, believed the text to be a later forgery. Upon examination, the *Cantong Qi* contains ancient passages on the dragon and tiger, such as the *Huoji*, which may have existed in antiquity but are not the versions transmitted today. Bao’s view likens it to the *Sanfen Shu* or *Hushou Jing*, though this remains uncertain.\n\nFurther, the *Jinbi Guwen Longhu Shangjing* is somewhat simpler than the *Cantong Qi*, yet its arrangement and phrasing are not far removed, appearing more orderly. Its closing line, \"The *Huoji* is not falsely made,\" echoes the *Qi*’s own words. Thus, the *Huoji* may well be the source of the *Cantong Qi*. Words are not idly crafted; theories do not arise without basis. Evidence is drawn from the young, and calculations align with the numinous. By analogy and structural analysis, principles are verified.\n\nKan’s *wu* is the essence of the moon; Li’s *ji* is the radiance of the sun. Sun and moon constitute the *Yi*, with firm and yielding in balance. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Blue, red, white, and black each occupy their directions, all receiving the power of the central palace, the work of *wu* and *ji*. This is also the method of constructing characters, clarifying how Kan’s moon and Li’s sun unite to form the *Yi*. For Kan’s *wu* and Li’s *ji* both reside in the central palace of earth, while the four directions and four phases all derive their *qi* from it.\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery, and no imagery is more luminous than the sun and moon. To fathom the numinous and know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives. Like spokes converging on a wheel’s hub, they turn in alternation, emerging and receding, coiling and uncoiling. This summarizes the *Yi* as embodied by the sun and moon. Below, the text elaborates on the method and the fire phases of a single month.\n\nFrom the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this time, heaven and earth mingle their essence, sun and moon clasp each other. The male yang scatters dark essence; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, and the root’s foundation is planted. Nurturing the bud, concentrating spirit, the body takes form. All things tread forth from this, and no movement is not born of it.\n\nThus, Confucius praised the primal chaos, where the virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the void. Investigating antiquity, he spoke of the primordial sovereign; the *Guanwei* established the beginning. The marriage knot of *qi* is tied, and in the first year, the sprout flourishes. The sage is not born in vain; he observes above to manifest the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, adapting to the times with sincerity and trust.\n\nThis method of the text divides one month into six segments, each governed by one of the six hexagrams: *Zhen* (☳) as the first, *Dui* (☱) the second, *Qian* (☰) the third, *Xun* (☴) the fourth, *Gen* (☶) the fifth, and *Kun* (☷) the sixth. Each segment spans five days, so it is said that on the first day of the lunar month, *Zhen* begins its influence, marking the initial interaction of the sun and moon’s yin and yang. Here, one applies the work of cultivation, just as the sage composed the Six Classics, each with its foundational origin. This is indeed the essential teaching of the entire passage. The lines *\"the male yang scatters dark essence; the female yin transforms the yellow womb\"* are the crux of this segment, while all else serves to elucidate this point.\n\nThus, the *Book of Changes* embodies the heart of heaven, and the hexagram *Fu* (☳, Return) establishes the first sprout. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to lay the foundation. Waxing and waning respond to the pitch pipes, rising and descending follow the pivot of the Dipper. Here, the month is further divided into twelve segments, arranged in the sequence of *Fu* (☳, Return), *Lin* (☷☴, Approach), *Tai* (☰☷☴, Peace), *Zhuang* (☰☰☴, Strength), *Guai* (☰☰☱, Breakthrough), *Qian* (☰☰☰, Creative), *Gou* (☷☰☰, Coming to Meet), *Dun* (☷☰☱, Retreat), *Pi* (☷☰☷, Standstill), *Guan* (☷☴☷, Contemplation), *Bo* (☷☶☷, Splitting Apart), and *Kun* (☷☷☷, Receptive), with each segment spanning two and a half days. *Fu* is the inner essence of the *Zhen* hexagram in the previous six-segment division. The eldest son is *Zhen*; the father is *Qian*; the mother is *Kun*. A later passage states: *\"On the first day of the lunar month, it is *Fu*.\"* On the third day, the moon emerges as clarity, *Zhen* receiving the *geng* position in the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, and the first quarter moon appears as straight as a cord. On the fifteenth day, the body of *Qian* is complete, full and radiant in the *jia* position of the east.\n\nThe toad and the hare’s essence—sun and moon’s *qi* shine as one. The toad, associated with the hexagram’s segments, and the hare, which spits forth light, describe the full moon’s complete reception of sunlight. The toad symbolizes gazing, the hare symbolizes emission. When the seventh and eighth days pass, the moon bends and descends. On the sixteenth day, it turns to receive new governance, *Xun* in *xin* appearing at dawn. *Gen* aligns with the south in *bing*, and on the twenty-third day, the last quarter moon appears. On the thirtieth day, *Kun* in *yi* loses its light in the northeast. The segments conclude and succeed one another; the inherited body gives birth to the dragon anew. *Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*, while *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.\n\nThe \"seven and eight\" refer to the fifteenth day. The sixteenth day marks the start of the fourth segment, where the first yin begins to form as *Xun*, completing the lunar essence, setting at dawn in the west at *xin*. On the twenty-third day, the middle of the fifth segment, the central yin arises as *Gen*, forming the last quarter moon, setting at midday in the south at *bing*. On the thirtieth day, the end of the sixth segment, all three yang transform, and the light vanishes as the moon’s body hides in the northeast—here, the character *ming* (brightness) is borrowed from *Peng* (☷☷☷) in the *Book of Changes*. When the six segments of the month are complete, they pass the succession to the following month. The eldest son inherits the father’s role, and *Zhen* is reborn. *Ren* pairs with *jia*, *gui* with *yi*, all belonging to *Qian* and *Kun*, encompassing the ten-day cycle’s beginning and end. From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, this completes one month’s regimen of firing times.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"In the space of a single breath, there are already the dark of the moon, the new moon, the quarters, and the full moon. The first quarter is the *qi*’s moment of growth, descending from above. The last quarter is the *qi*’s moment of decline, ascending from below. The full moon is the *qi*’s fullness, when the sun sinks below and the moon rounds above. Between the dark and new moon, the sun and moon conjoin in the heavens—this is like using water to extinguish fire, or metal returning to its original nature.\"*\n\nThe numbers seven and eight make fifteen, while nine and six also correspond. These four combine to make thirty, when the yang *qi* is exhausted and hidden away. The *ba gua* array the celestial luminaries, their movements never losing the center. The subtle essence of the mysterious is difficult to fathom; one must infer and verify through signs. In stillness, observe its images and model its forms. Set up standards as a guide, and divine auspices to determine good or ill fortune. Issue decrees in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment when the lines move.\n\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, sequence the flows of earth’s forms. In the middle, investigate human nature, and harmonize the Three Powers through mutual consideration. In action, follow the hexagram’s segments; in stillness, rely on the *Xiang*’s words. When *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice, the world is then governed. Here, *\"Qian and Kun are put into practice\"* refers to *\"using nine\"* and *\"using six\"*—*\"governed\"* may also be written as *\"ordered,\"* likely to avoid a Tang taboo.\n\nWhat follows, down to *\"the state’s origin harms the Dao,\"* uses governance as a metaphor. How can one not be cautious in the first principles of ruling? Bind fast the subtle and profound, open and spread the treasures. The essential Dao holds the handle of authority, unifying transformation’s guiding threads. When the lines stir within, good and ill fortune arise without. The five planets move in harmony or discord, responding to the times with resonance. When the four and seven fall into disorder, extravagance and decline follow in their wake. The *Wenchang* oversees the records, while the Three Dukes are held accountable. The hundred officials and their bureaus each govern their respective domains. The sun harmonizes the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew. Trace the beginning to grasp the end, for therein lies the thread of survival or ruin.\n\nIf the ruler is arrogant and indulgent, overbearing and deviating from the Dao; if the minister is deceitful and flattering, acting outside the proper path—then the waxing and waning of the moon, its fullness and contraction, will fall into disorder and misfortune. Those who enforce the law must admonish and criticize, binding faults and shifting blame to the ruler. The Pole Star receives its correctness, at ease and entrusting matters below. The Bright Hall enacts governance, yet the state’s origin harms the Dao. These are all metaphorical expressions, yet within them lie details worthy of careful reflection.\n\nInwardly, cultivate the self through tranquility and emptiness. The primordial root hides or reveals itself, inwardly illuminating the body’s form. Seal the *Dui* (mouth), and fortify the numinous root.\n\nThe Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the child-pearl.\nInvisible to the eye, yet near and easily sought.\nThe yellow center gradually permeates principle, moistening and nourishing the skin and flesh.\nAt first, rectify to ensure enduring cultivation; the trunk stands firm, but the branches cannot yet be grasped.\nThe One veils and conceals—none in the world know of it.\n\nThis speaks of inner matters, most essential within the scriptures.\nYet the phrase *\"The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the child-pearl\"* is the most crucial of the crucial.\nThe earlier metaphors of governing at the helm, wielding authority and binding the net’s cords, precisely refer to this.\n*Initial rectification* and *trunk standing firm* speak of origins;\n*enduring cultivation* and *grasping the branches* speak of conclusions.\n*The One veils and conceals* describes the hidden, unmanifested nature of its inception.\n\nThe supreme virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through scrutiny.\nThe lesser virtue strives ceaselessly, its function unceasing.\nWhen the upper is sealed, it is called *being*; when the lower is sealed, it is called *origin*.\nThe *origin* serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides.\nThese two apertures follow the method of metal-qi, mutually dependent.\n\nWhat follows grows increasingly abstruse; here, I offer a tentative interpretation.\nThe *supreme virtue* refers to the earlier passage’s *feminine yin transforming the yellow womb*, where the Three Luminaries sink into qi and the pivot of the origin operates in obscurity—what the later text calls *mercury as the flowing pearl* and *the Azure Dragon as the mother of the flowing pearl*, precisely what lies beyond the reach of thought.\nThe *lesser virtue* refers to the earlier *masculine yang spreading the profound, warming and nurturing the child-pearl*, and the later *White Tiger as the father of smelted yellow earth*—the very place where intent and effort are applied. If sealed improperly, all lose their proper alignment.\nThus, the *origin* serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides. The *Canon of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *\"Above, the Azure Dragon dwells.\"* The *metal* here refers to the masculine yang’s White Tiger.\n\nIn general, when yang descends, yin naturally ascends.\nThe so-called *apertures*—as the *Song of the Cauldron* says: *\"Yin above\"*—are also of utmost importance.\n*Knowing the white, guarding the black* is the foundation of water.\nWater is the Dao; its number is one.\nThe *white* refers to mercury, the *black* to lead.\nThe *metal essence* speaks of its birth from lead.\nThe *water foundation* can generate water.\nWhite and black, each one, become water and the pivot of the Dao—this is the so-called *numinous virtue*.\n\nAt the inception of yin and yang, the profound contains the yellow sprout.\nThe master of the five metals is the Northern River Cart.\n*The profound contains the yellow sprout*: water holds earth, still yet intentional.\n*The Northern River Cart*: black generates water.\nJudging from the later text, this precisely refers to lead.\nThus, lead is black without but harbors golden splendor within.\nClad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, outwardly a madman.\nLead is the *metal-qi* mentioned earlier.\nMetal is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child in the womb.\nWater is the child of metal; the child hides within the mother’s womb.\nThis is the meaning of *knowing the white, guarding the black* from above.\n\nThe true person’s subtlety is as if existing, as if not.\nVaguely resembling a great abyss, now sinking, now floating.\nWithdrawing, they distribute and guard their respective domains.\nThis is the so-called *warming and nurturing the child-pearl*.\n\nGazing upon it, it resembles whiteness; refining it, it becomes vermilion.\nTempered into a protective barrier, the white enfolds the pure within.\nRound or square, a *cun* in diameter, blending and constraining one another.\nBorn before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted.\nSurrounding it are ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s isles.\nEncircling and sealing, fourfold yet enclosed.\nGuarded and secured, barring all wickedness.\nCurved corridors connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen.\n\nThe *cun in diameter* is the so-called *child-pearl*.\nThe *ramparts and gates* may refer to the later text’s *\"the ruler of emotions manages the exterior, building ramparts as city walls.\"*\nYet their exact meaning remains unclear.\nThey defy contemplation, resisting anxious toil.\n\nWithin the hall, spirit and qi brim—none can detain them.\nHe who guards them prospers; he who loses them perishes.\nIn motion and stillness, rest and repose, they ever accompany man.\nThis is no mere repository of right and wrong, but an inner vision of contemplation.\nTreading the steps of the Dipper’s lodges, reckoning the Six Jia by sun and stars.\nThe Yin Way suppresses nine and one, muddling and toying with the Mysterious Womb.\nIngesting qi, the intestines rumble; exhaling the stale, inhaling the fresh and foul.\nDay and night without sleep, the bowels never cease their churning.\nThe body grows weary and spent, dazed as though deranged.\nThe hundred vessels seethe and surge, denied their clear and settled dwelling.\nEncircling altars are raised, dawn and dusk devoted to rites and offerings.\nPhantoms manifest in form, dreams stir deep emotions.\nThe heart trembles, the mind rejoices—one believes longevity assured.\nYet suddenly, life is cut short; the corpse rots and lies exposed.\nEvery action runs awry, perverse and contrary to the pivot of mechanism.\nThe manifold defenses are legion—thousands of strands, ten thousand more.\nAdvancing and retreating, they defy the Yellow and the Old,\ntwisting and turning, clashing against the Nine Capitals.\n\nThis speaks of how the Dao differs from all lesser arts and minor methods,\nyet its full meaning cannot be exhaustively explained.\nThe enlightened grasp its purport, perceiving its source with clarity.\nDiligent in practice, day and night unceasing,\nafter three years of ingestion, one becomes light and roams afar.\nEntering fire, one is not scorched; entering water, one is not drenched.\nAble to preserve or dissolve, ever joyful and free from care.\nThe Dao is perfected, virtue is accomplished, lying hidden until the dust settles.\nThe Great One summons, relocating one to the Central Isle.\nWith merit fulfilled, one ascends, receiving the chart as due record.\n\nThe *Fire Record* is no empty composition—it expounds the *Yi* to illuminate these truths.\nThe crescent-moon crucible and furnace, the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement.\nMercury as the Sun’s flowing pearl, the Azure Dragon accompanying it.\nRaising the East to meet the West, soul and spirit naturally constrain one another.\nThe upper crescent aligns with Dui’s number eight; the lower crescent does the same.\n\nThe crescent moon is thought to be round below and cleft above, resembling a recumbent moon.\nThe White Tiger is lead, fire, qi, the West, the po, yang—serving as the pivot of refinement,\nsignifying the downward rush that yields to steaming ascent.\nMercury as the Sun is essence.\nThe Azure Dragon is water, the East, the hun, yin.\n\nThe upper crescent is yang; the lower crescent is yin.\nMaster Zhu said: Kan and Li, water and fire, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury—\nthese are but interchangeable names; in truth, they are merely the two of essence and qi.\nEssence is water, Kan, the dragon, mercury.\nQi is fire, Li, the tiger, lead.\nThe method employs spirit to circulate essence and qi, congealing them into the elixir.\nYang qi below first forms water; refined by fire, it coagulates into the elixir.\nThis teaching is most singular.\n\nWhen the two crescents merge their essence, the forms of Qian and Kun are complete.\nTwo eights make a pound—the *Yi*’s Dao stands firm and unshaken.\nEight days bring the Dui crescent; eight more complete Qian’s body.\nTwenty-three days bring the Gen crescent; eight fewer complete Kun’s body.\nOne annotation states: a pound contains three hundred eighty-four zhu, corresponding to the number of lines.\nFor this is the count of zhu in a pound.\nFrom Zhen it arises, to Qian it fills, through Xun it wanes, to Kun it is exhausted.\n\nGold enters fierce fire, yet its radiant luster remains undiminished.\nSince the dawn of creation, the sun and moon have never dimmed their light,\nnor has gold lost its weight; their forms endure as ever.\nGold is born of the moon, at the new moon receiving the sun’s tally.\nGold returns to its mother, the moon’s dark embracing the sun.\nConcealing its frame, it sinks into the cavernous void.\nGold regains its original nature, its majestic brilliance rejoicing in the crucible.\n\nGold is lead. \"Gold returns to its mother\" means withdrawing and concealing,\nthe sun no longer illuminating the moon—pure Kun trigram.\nThe character *xi* (嬉) was originally written as *xi* (喜), in one version as *xi* (僖).\nUpon examination, none make sense.\nAccording to the *Shuowen*, *xi* (嬉) means \"flaming.\"\nThe Later Han often used this character.\n\nThe numbers of zi and wu combine to three; wu and ji are called five.\nWhen three and five harmonize, the eight minerals serve as the guiding principle.\nInhalation and exhalation covet one another, awaiting the union of husband and wife.\nYellow earth is gold’s father; flowing pearl is water’s mother.\nWater treats earth as a ghost; earth fills water, preventing its rise.\nThe Vermilion Bird is fire’s essence, holding the balance to regulate victory and defeat.\nWhen water prevails, fire is extinguished; both perish, returning to the thick earth.\nOnce the three natures unite, their original essence shares a common ancestor.\n\nZi water is one; wu fire is two—their numbers combine to three.\nWu-ji earth is five. Three and five merge to form eight.\nEight represents the mineral image, yet in truth, there are but two things—water and fire—\nwith earth as the master.\nEarth pertains to the spleen, which governs intention, meaning the mind directs fire downward and water upward,\nbreathing in harmony.\nGold is fire. The Vermilion Bird likely refers to the heart, also the master of intention.\n\"Holding the balance\" means wielding the scale, governing summer.\nThis text’s intent largely concerns refining water with fire, diminishing fire with water—\nechoing the earlier theme of the moon receiving the sun’s light and returning to its mother.\n\nSesame still extends life; returning cinnabar enters the mouth.\nGold’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things.\nWhen alchemists ingest it, their lifespan endures long.\nEarth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.\nGolden sand enters the five viscera, mist scattering like wind and rain.\nSteaming and permeating the four limbs, the complexion becomes radiant and fair.\nWhite hair reverts to black as of old.\nThe elderly man regains his youth; the old woman becomes a maiden.\nTransforming form to escape worldly calamity, one is called a True Person.\n\nThis speaks of the inner elixir yet describes it as if taken by mouth.\nIts meaning remains unclear.\nElsewhere, I have seen it rush into the crimson gate below.\n\nLead powder cast into fire, its color ruined, reverts to lead.\nIce and snow met with warm broth dissolve into the Great Mystery.\n\nGold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury.\nTransformation arises from its authenticity, beginning and ending in mutual dependence.\nAll these serve as metaphors for change through like kinds.\nFor those weary of ingesting and refining, one should use substances of the same kind.\nPlant millet with millet seeds; hatch chickens with their own eggs.\nBy aligning with kind to aid nature, things form easily as if shaped by the potter’s wheel.\nFish eyes are not pearls; fleabane does not become a casket.\nLike kinds follow one another; disparate matters cannot become treasure.\nThus, swallows and sparrows do not birth phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.\nWater does not flow upward in flames; fire does not move downward to moisten.\nAgain, it is shown that different kinds cannot complete one another.\n\nWorldly scholars abound, boasting lofty wisdom and fine talent.\nYet by chance they fail to meet their moment, wasting fire and squandering wealth.\nClinging to texts and following words, they recklessly impose their own ideas.\nThe thread’s origin is lost, and their measures and grasp falter.\nThey pound and refine chalcanthite, mica, and magnetite,\nburn sulfur with camphor wood, and smelt mercury with clay.\nThey smelt bronze with the five minerals below the bellows,\nusing them as pivotal aids.\nYet these are of mixed natures and different kinds—how could they willingly unite?\nA thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; what they seek to transmute turns instead to folly.\nFrom youth to white-haired age, halfway they grow suspicious.\nTurning from the Dao, they cling to deluded paths, stepping from the upright into crooked byways.\nTheir vision narrow as a tube, they cannot fathom what lies ahead.\nThis speaks of those who pursue the outer elixir: if the medicines are not of the same kind, they cannot become treasure.\n\nAs for the utmost sages, none surpass Fu Xi,\nwho drew the eight trigrams, emulating heaven’s pattern.\nKing Wen, ancestor of emperors, structured the hexagrams and composed their judgments.\nConfucius, the near-sage and hero, wrote the *Ten Wings* to aid them.\nThese three were heaven’s chosen, rising in succession to govern their times.\nThough their excellence followed steps and their merits differed not,\ntheir creations built upon one another, their calculations precise to the smallest fraction.\nThe tangible is easy to measure; the formless and subtle are hard to plan.\nTheir deeds set models for emulation, establishing for the world the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*.\nWithout prior knowledge as resource, they awakened through their teachers.\nBright as if ascending a high terrace with curtains drawn, they saw clearly.\nThis speaks of the three sages rising in succession: Fu Xi modeled heaven, King Wen followed Fu Xi, and Confucius followed King Wen.\nThe tangible is easy to shape; the formless is difficult to attain.\n*Yin* here means they themselves awakened to this principle through their teachers.\nThe two lines on the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* remain unclear.\n\nThe *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters share the same aim.\nThough their words are earnest, people do not ponder them deeply.\nTracing their origins and flows, the hidden and manifest originally dwell together.\nI await the discourse of the worthy—how dare I lightly commit this to writing?\nHolding my tongue, I wish to remain silent, yet to cut off the Dao invites punishment.\nPouring my thoughts onto bamboo and silk, I fear leaking heaven’s tally.\nHesitant, I sigh, gazing up and down, stitching together this foolishness.\nThough the potter’s wheel has its methods, I cannot bear to lay it all bare.\nI sketch only its outlines; its branches and leaves will be seen in the refining.\n\nThe *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters—an ancient text now lost, its details unknown.\nUse gold as the embankment, and water and fire move freely.\nGold’s number is fifteen; water’s number is the same.\nWhen measuring at the furnace, let water exceed by five parts.\nTake these two as true, gold’s weight as originally set.\nThe third does not enter; fire’s two parts accompany them.\nThe two substances contain and receive one another, their transformations wondrous as spirits.\nAt once, the qi of Great Yang arises, steaming and seething in an instant.\nFirst liquid, then congealed, it is called the Yellow Chariot.\nThis speaks of the first transformation of the elixir.\nGold and water appear above.\n*Enter* should read *fire*, as below there are three things—thus it should be *fire*.\nYet it also says \"the qi of Great Yang arises below,\" which seems to involve only two things.\nPerhaps it should read *eight*, and *three* should be *two*.\nThis refers to gold and water, both numbered fifteen, with water divided into five parts, only two used—six of fifteen.\nThe three are nine of fifteen.\nWater’s two parts—some read *fire’s two*—correspond to the three things of water and fire above.\nBut above there is no mention of fire’s weight, and below the word *Great Yang* appears, so this may not be the case.\nThe two substances containing and receiving one another are the union of yin and yang, Kan and Li.\nThe error of *three things* is quite clear.\n\nAs the years and months near their end, nature is harmed and lifespan shortened.\nThe body becomes ash and earth, its form like bright dust in a vessel.\nThis seems to describe the second transformation.\nPound, refine, and combine them, then rush into the crimson gate.\nSecurely seal their meeting, striving for perfect solidity.\nBlazing fire spreads below, its sound ceaseless day and night.\nAt first, civil methods are employed; in the end, martial ones are displayed.\nObserve with care, scrutinizing the adjustments of cold and warmth.\nCycle through the twelve nodes; when each ends, inspect closely again.\nQi wanes, life nears its end, rest and death claim the hun and po.\nThe color shifts to purple, resplendent, forming the Returned Elixir.\nGround to a single pill, the spatula’s touch is most divine.\nThis is the third transformation.\n*Pounding, refining, and combining*—this must involve some other process.\nThe *crimson gate* refers to the mouth.\nWhen liquid congeals to ash and earth, the principle becomes self-evident:\nit is spat out, refined, then swallowed again.\nThe *blazing fire* is the aforementioned qi of Great Yang.\n*Its sound ceaseless*—later chapters also speak of a mournful, wailing sound, like an infant longing for its mother.\n*Civil* may be a scribal error for *cultivate*; Tang-era texts often confuse the two.\n*Qi wanes, life nears its end*—this echoes the earlier idea of fire extinguished and gold restored.\n*Ground to a pill, spatula’s touch*—the details remain unclear.\n\nExpounding the numbers of the five phases, concise yet not cumbersome:\nUse water to stimulate fire, and suddenly its brilliance is extinguished.\nSun and moon press close, ever dwelling between darkness and dawn.\nWhen water prevails, Kan encroaches on yang; when fire weakens, Li’s day grows dim.\n\nYin and Yang consume one another,\ntheir mutual interaction the natural Way.\nNames serve to fix the essence,\ncharacters speak of the nature’s hue.\nWhen metal returns to its original state,\nonly then is it called the Reverted Elixir.\nThis explains the meaning of the Reverted Elixir’s name in the preceding text—\nfor when fire is extinguished, metal is restored.\n\nI dare not speak emptily,\nbut follow the sages’ patterns.\nAncient *Records* speak of Dragon and Tiger,\nthe Yellow Emperor praised Golden Flower.\nHuainan refined Autumn Stone,\nWang Yang added Yellow Sprouts.\nThe worthy can uphold and practice this,\nwhile the unworthy must not partake.\nThe Way from ancient times to now is one—\nface-to-face discourse reveals its plan.\nScholars, exert yourselves further,\nhold these words in mind and ponder deeply.\nThe essential teaching is laid bare,\nlucid and never deceiving.\n\n*This concludes the first scroll of the* Cantong qi.\n*(The original text lacks “First Scroll of the* Cantong qi*, with Later Student Huang Ruijie of Luling’s Postscript”; this is added here according to the context.)*\n\n*First Scroll of the* Cantong qi\n*Postscript by Later Student Huang Ruijie of Luling*\n\n**Middle Scroll**\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun,\npaired and embracing each other.\nYang bestows, yin receives—\nmale and female depend on one another.\nThrough this, creation unfolds,\nand essence and qi expand.\nKan and Li crown the head,\nradiance spreading forth.\nThe profound and obscure are hard to fathom,\nbeyond depiction in diagrams.\nThe sage measures and weighs,\narranging the foundations of the mysterious.\nThe four blend into chaos,\nentering directly into emptiness and nothingness.\nThe sixty-four hexagrams cycle,\nspread out as a chariot.\nDragon and horse are harnessed,\nthe enlightened ruler steers the times.\nIn harmony, they follow—\nthe path is level, not deviant.\nDeviant ways are perilous and treacherous,\ntoppling nations into danger.\nThis mirrors the first chapter of the preceding scroll.\n\nThe noble one dwells in his chamber;\nwhen his words are good,\nthey resonate a thousand *li* away.\nThis speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots,\nabiding in his nine-fold chamber,\nissuing decrees and commands,\naligning with the seasons of yin and yang,\nstoring instruments and awaiting the hour,\nnever transgressing the days of the hexagrams.\n*Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*;\n*Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams\neach have their own days.\nI briefly set forth the two images,\nthough I cannot exhaust their details.\nEstablish righteousness and enact punishments,\napply benevolence and bestow virtue.\nThose who oppose meet misfortune;\nthose who comply find fortune.\nFollow the calendar and decrees,\nwith utmost sincerity and focus.\nCarefully observe the days and hours,\nscrutinizing waxing and waning.\nEven the slightest deviation\nbrings regret and harm.\nAt the solstices, the measures change,\ndeviating and twisting.\nMidwinter brings scorching heat,\nmidsummer sees sleet and snow.\nAt the equinoxes, all is askew,\nnot even a moment’s delay.\nWind and rain fail to follow their seasons,\nflood and drought contend.\nLocusts surge like boiling water,\nmountains collapse and the earth splits.\nHeaven displays its omens,\nmyriad anomalies arise on all sides.\nThe filial son’s devotion\nmoves the imperial pole.\nNear at hand, it begins with his own words;\nafar, it flows to distant lands.\nSome bring calamity,\nsome bring blessings.\nSome usher in great peace,\nsome incite war and upheaval.\nThe coming of these four\nstems from the heart’s intent.\nMovement and stillness have their constancy—\nadhere to their guiding line.\nThe four seasons follow their proper course,\nharmonizing with qi.\nFirmness and softness are distinct,\nnever encroaching upon one another.\nThe Five Phases guard their boundaries,\nnever recklessly expanding or contracting.\nThe *Yi* flows in cycles,\nbending and stretching, reversing and repeating.\nThis mirrors the preceding scroll’s discussion of *Zhun* and *Meng*,\ntheir morning and evening, inner essence and outer application.\n\nNow, Qian receives *jia* and *ren*,\nKun receives *yi* and *gui*;\nZhen receives *geng*,\nXun receives *xin*;\nKan receives *wu*,\nLi receives *ji*;\nGen receives *bing*,\nDui receives *ding*.\n\nThe method of doubling the hexagrams:\nQian’s lower three lines receive *jiazi*, *yin*, *chen*;\nits upper three lines receive *renwu*, *shen*, *xu*.\nKun’s lower three lines receive *yiwei*, *si*, *mao*;\nits upper three lines receive *guichou*, *hai*, *you*.\nZhen’s lower three lines receive *gengzi*, *yin*, *chen*;\nits upper three lines receive *gengwu*, *shen*, *xu*.\nXun’s lower three lines receive *xinchou*, *hai*, *you*;\nits upper three lines receive *xinwei*, *si*, *mao*.\nKan’s lower three lines receive *wuyin*, *chen*, *wu*;\nits upper three lines receive *wushen*, *xu*, *zi*.\nLi’s lower three lines receive *jimao*, *chou*, *hai*;\nits upper three lines receive *jiyou*, *wei*, *si*.\nGen’s lower three lines receive *bingchen*, *wu*, *shen*;\nits upper three lines receive *bingxu*, *zi*, *yin*.\nDui’s lower three lines receive *dingsi*, *mao*, *chou*;\nits upper three lines receive *dinghai*, *you*, *wei*.\n\nThus, the inner essence ranges from *zi* to *chen* and *si*,\nwhile the outer application spans from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\nTherefore, in the morning *Zhun*,\nthe first yang line, *gengzi*, corresponds to the *zi* hour;\nthe fourth yin line, *wushen*, corresponds to the *mao* hour.\nIn the evening *Meng*,\nthe first yin line, *wuyin*, corresponds to the *wu* hour;\nthe fourth yin line, *wuxu*, corresponds to the *you* hour.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams\nare deduced by this method.\nThis again speaks of the fire-phase within a single day.\n\nBetween the last and first days of the lunar month,\nthe tally aligns and moves within.\nChaos and vastness,\nfemale and male follow one another.\nNourishing fluids moisten and enrich,\ntransformation flows and circulates.\nHeaven and earth’s spirits\nare beyond measure.\nEmploy them to secure the body,\nconcealing form and hiding away.\nIt begins in the northeast,\nthe region of *Ji* and *Dou*.\nTurning rightward,\nit spews forth sprouts like a wheel.\nHidden depths reveal their image,\ndispersing radiant essence.\nAbove *Bi* and *Xu*,\nZhen emerges as the omen.\nYang qi begins its inception—\nthe first yang, the hidden dragon.\nYang is established in threes,\nyin flows in eights.\nThus, on the third day, Zhen stirs;\non the eighth day, Dui proceeds.\nThe second yang, the visible dragon,\nis peaceful and bright.\nWhen the virtues of three and five are complete,\nthe body of Qian is formed.\nThe third yang, ever vigilant at dusk,\nloses and breaks the divine tally.\nProsperity and decline gradually shift,\nultimately returning to their origin.\nXun continues the lineage,\nfirmly securing and upholding.\nThe fourth yang may leap,\nadvancing and retreating on a perilous path.\nGen governs progression and pause,\nunable to seize the moment.\nOn the twenty-third day,\nit holds fast to the crescent phase.\nThe fifth yang, the flying dragon,\nascends to heaven’s position with joy.\nThe fifth yin, Kun’s reception,\nbinds and completes the beginning and end.\nNurturing the multitude of offspring,\nit becomes the mother of all kinds.\nYang’s numbers are exhausted—\nonce complete, they rise again.\nFollowing nature and uniting with essence,\nthey turn and join together.\nThe ninth yang, the overbearing dragon,\nbattles virtue in the wilds.\nUsing the nine, they soar lightly,\nbecoming the compass and square of the Dao.\nFollowing the revolving jade armillary,\nascending and descending, rising and falling.\nFlowing through the six lines,\nit is hard to observe and perceive.\nThus, the primal constant position\nis the ancestral founder of the *Yi*.\nThis again speaks of the fire-phase within a month\nthrough the reception of Qian’s six lines,\nilluminating the waxing and waning of yang qi.\n\n*Ji* and *Dou* refer only to the northeast,\n*Bi* and *Xu* only to the west—\nborrowing heaven’s four directions\nto speak of earth’s four directions,\nnot meaning heaven’s east, north, or west.\n\nThe twenty-sixth day is likely a misprint for \"twenty.\"\n\"Twenty\" is pronounced *ru*, meaning twenty.\nOn the twenty-sixth day, awaiting the hour,\nthe hexagram *Kun* governs.\nThe *Use of the Nine* and below\nmirror the preceding scroll’s discussion of the two uses of Qian and Kun.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* governs—\nyang qi first flows through.\nIts entry and exit swift and keen,\na marker stands, subtly firm.\nYellow Bell aligns with *Zi*,\nportents then grow clear and bright.\nSoft warmth is sown and spread,\nthe common folk receive their constant due.\nAt the *Lin* furnace, branches are applied,\nthe path is opened, right and radiant.\nThe light’s brilliance quietly advances,\nday by day it lengthens.\nGreat Frame in *Chou* binds,\nadjusting heights and depths.\nLifting, it forms *Tai*,\nhard and soft both flourish.\nYin and yang join and meet,\nthe small departs, the great arrives.\nSpokes turn toward *Yin*,\nmoving in accord with the season.\nGradually passing through *Dazhuang*,\nthey flank the gate of *Mao*.\nElm pods fall and scatter,\nreturning to their root.\nPunishment and virtue bear each other,\nday and night begin to part.\nIn *Guai*, yin retreats,\nyang ascends and presses forward.\nWashing and shaking wings and feathers,\nit shakes off the dust of old lodging.\n*Qian*’s vigor shines bright,\nits vast influence reaches the four neighbors.\nYang ends at *Si*,\nat the center they contend.\n*Gou* begins its threads,\ntreading frost comes first.\nThe well’s cold spring,\n*Wu* serves as honored guest.\nThe guest submits to yin,\nyin becomes the host.\n*Dun* departs from its position,\ngathering in its essence,\ncherishing virtue and awaiting the time,\nit dwells in obscurity and darkness.\n*Pi* closes and does not open,\nwhat sprouts cannot grow.\nYin extends, yang is reviled,\nyang’s name is lost.\n*Guan* weighs its power,\nexamining the mid-autumn mood.\nIt entrusts the young and tender,\nthe old and withered flourish again.\nShepherd’s purse and wheat sprout,\nburgeoning forth under cover.\n*Bo* rots the limbs,\ndissolving its form.\nThe transforming qi is exhausted,\nthe utmost spirit is lost.\nWhen the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back,\nreturning to *Kun*’s origin.\nEver compliant with earth’s patterns,\nit receives heaven and spreads its decree.\nDark, distant, and subtle,\nbarriers connect as one.\nResponding to measure and nurturing life,\nthe source of yin and yang.\nVast and indistinct,\nnone know its beginning.\nThose who first stray lose the track,\nlater they become lords.\nThe primal is level, not slanted—\nthe Dao’s natural course.\nChange and renewal grow abundant,\nwaxing and waning follow one another.\n*Kun* ends, *Fu* begins,\nlike tracing a linked ring.\nEmperors and kings receive and serve it,\nthrough a thousand autumns it endures.\n\nThis divides a month’s fire-phase in detail through the twelve hexagrams,\nand likewise applies to a year’s fire-phase.\nIn the method for a month,\ntwo and a half days form one hexagram:\n*Fu* is *Zhen*’s *Kun*,\n*Lin* is *Dui*’s *Kun*,\n*Tai* is *Qian*’s *Kun*,\n*Dazhuang* is *Qian*’s *Zhen*,\n*Guai* is *Qian*’s *Dui*,\n*Qian* is *Qian*’s *Qian*,\n*Gou* is *Qian*’s *Xun*,\n*Dun* is *Qian*’s *Gen*,\n*Pi* is *Qian*’s *Kun*,\n*Guan* is *Kun*’s *Xun*,\n*Bo* is *Kun*’s *Gen*,\n*Kun* is *Kun*’s *Kun*.\n*Lin* is *Fu*’s *Zhen*,\n*Dazhuang* is *Fu*’s *Dui*,\n*Qian* is *Fu*’s *Qian*,\n*Dun* is *Fu*’s *Xun*,\n*Guan* is *Fu*’s *Gen*,\n*Kun* is *Fu*’s *Kun*—\nthe principles of their derivation\nare spoken through hexagram names, pitch names, and celestial stems.\n*Fu zou* is *Taicu*;\n*xia lie* is *Jiazhong*.\n\nWashing and cleansing correspond to *Guxi*;\n\"Middle\" corresponds to *Zhonglü*;\ndim obscurity corresponds to *Linzhong*;\n\"extension\" corresponds to *shen*;\n\"accumulated task\" corresponds to *Nanlü*;\n\"closure\" corresponds to *hai*;\n\"response\" corresponds to *Yingzhong*.\nFor the most part, these are forced analogies and baseless attributions, not worth deep inquiry.\n\nThe later phrase \"for the lord\" should be read as \"only after studying the *Yi* does one become lord,\" an error long established.\n\nTo cultivate one’s nature, prolong life, and reverse destiny:\nfirst reflect on the end, then consider the beginning.\nThe body one receives is fundamentally of one origin.\nPrimal essence spreads like clouds, relying on qi to take form.\nYin and yang serve as measures, the dwelling of hun and po.\nThe yang spirit is the sun’s hun, the yin spirit the moon’s po.\nHun and po, each serving as the other’s dwelling:\nthe nature resides within, establishing barriers and enclosures;\nthe emotions operate without, building walls and outer ramparts.\nWhen walls and ramparts are complete, people and things find peace.\nAt this time, emotions align with heaven and earth.\nHeaven moves and extends, qi spreads and essence flows;\nearth is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s abode.\nThe firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes.\nNine returns, seven reversions, eight’s return, six’s residence.\nMale is white, female is red—metal and fire restrain each other.\nWater settles fire, the inception of the five phases.\nSupreme goodness resembles water, clear and without flaw.\nThe Dao’s form and image, the true one, are hard to depict.\nTransforming and dispersing, each dwells in its own place,\nlike a chicken’s egg, black and white supporting each other.\nA square inch in length and breadth marks the beginning.\nFour limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones take shape.\nAfter ten months, it emerges from the womb:\nbones soft enough to coil, flesh smooth as lead.\nThis mirrors the earlier passage on \"knowing the white.\"\nIt speaks of human birth, formed through the union of yin and yang.\nNow, to refine the elixir is likewise so.\nAll who speak of the Dao borrow the elixir’s name.\n(Lead is likely a miswriting of \"malt,\" confused by resemblance.)\n\nThe yang-burning mirror gathers fire; without the sun, it emits no light.\nThe *fangzhu* vessel, without stars or moon, how could it yield water?\nThe two qi are profound and distant, yet their resonance still communicates.\nHow much more so for what lies near in the body, pressing upon heart and chest?\nYin and yang pair with sun and moon; water and fire serve as proofs.\nEars, eyes, and mouth—three treasures—firmly seal them, do not let them scatter.\n\nThe true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming within the compass’s bounds.\nWinding and turning to survey, opening and closing all align.\nThey serve as the axle and linchpin of the self, in motion and stillness inexhaustible.\nThe *li* qi inwardly guards and protects; *kan* then ceases its function.\n*Dui* joins without speech; rare words follow the great.\nOnce these three are secured as the mechanism, relax the body in an empty chamber.\nEntrust your will to the void’s origin, making non-thought your constant.\nProof is hard to shift; the heart concentrates without straying.\nIn sleep, spirit embraces spirit; in waking, await the signs of presence or absence.\nThe complexion sleeps and moistens; bones and joints grow ever stronger.\nExpelling the host of yin demons, only then establish true yang.\nCultivate this without cease, and the cloud-rain qi will move,\ndrizzling like spring rain, trickling like melting ice.\nFrom head to foot it flows, then ultimately ascends again.\nComing and going, it penetrates the ultimate origin, suffusing the body’s vessel.\nReversion is the Dao’s verification; weakness is virtue’s handle.\nWeed out long-standing filth, and the subtle is harmonized.\nThe turbid is the path to clarity; prolonged darkness yields brightness.\n\nThis passage concerns the work of nurturing the root, especially urgent and essential.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The *li* qi inwardly guards and protects\"—I have seen earlier scholars read *nei* as \"to receive,\" and their interpretation is correct.\n\nPeople favor petty arts, not examining the Dao’s depth.\nAbandoning the correct path for deviant shortcuts, they seek speed but find no passage.\n\nAs the blind refuse their staff, the deaf strain to hear gong and shang.\nDiving into water to seize pheasant and hare, climbing mountains to seek fish and dragon.\nPlanting wheat yet hoping for millet, wielding compasses to draw squares.\nExhausting spirit and strength, through the year no merit is seen.\n\nTo know the method of ingesting elixirs: the affair is simple, not burdensome.\nThe flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to leave man.\nSuddenly obtaining Golden Flower, it turns and interrelates.\nTransformed into white liquid, congealing to utmost hardness.\nThe Golden Flower first initiates; after a brief interval,\nit dissolves and becomes water, its horse-teeth arrayed in ranks.\nYang then goes to harmonize, nature and essence in spontaneity.\nPressing and hastening the time of yin, confining and restraining the gate.\nThe loving mother desires to nurture; the filial son repays kindness.\nThe stern father issues commands, instructing and disciplining descendants.\nThe Five Phases contend for dominion, each relying on the other to arise.\nFire’s nature melts metal; metal fells the flourishing wood.\nThree and five become one—heaven and earth’s purest essence.\nThis may be transmitted orally, yet is difficult to convey in writing.\n\nYou must turn left at *zi*; at *wu* rotate eastward.\n*Mao* and *you* form the boundary, establishing the two names.\nThe dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.\nEach drinks and feeds upon the other, both coveting the advantage.\nThus they interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another.\nWhen *Yinghuo* guards the west and *Taibai* traverses the heavens,\nthe killing qi descends—what could withstand its overthrow?\nThe cat guards the mouse; crows and sparrows fear the hawk.\nEach has its function—how dare they utter a sound?\n\nWithout grasping the principle, idle words are futile.\nExhausting the family’s wealth, wife and children suffer hunger and poverty.\nFrom ancient times to now, countless millions have pursued this path,\nyet few achieve success, rare are those who complete it.\nSeeking famous medicines far and wide, they stray from the Dao.\nIf truly you encounter it, observe its beginnings and threads.\nBy kind compare with kind; weigh things from start to finish.\n\nThe Five Phases overcome one another, each in turn becoming father and mother.\nThe mother contains the nourishing essence; the father governs bestowal and granting.\nCongealing essence and flowing form, even metal and stone do not decay.\nIf one is single-minded and does not leak, one may attain the Dao and achieve completion.\nThose who study minor arts labor without result; those who obtain this method are concise and free from trouble.\nFrom the Greater Yang downward, this corresponds internally and externally with the preceding chapters on \"Knowing the White,\" \"Pivot of Calcination,\" and \"Yellow Chariot.\"\n\nThe Five Phases engender one another—this is the kindness of mother and child.\nFire and metal overcome one another—this is the stern command of the father.\n\"Three and Five\" refers to fire, metal, and wood, all receiving the qi of earth.\nAnother interpretation holds that \"Three and Five\" refers to the earlier \"zi, wu, wu, and ji,\" though one version remains unclear as to its reference.\nSome say it should read \"as\" instead of \"with,\" and the following \"Three and Five\" and \"One\" also follow this pattern.\n\"East\" may be a corruption for \"left,\" referring here to the fixed positions of yin and yang.\n\nThe six lines on the dragon and tiger speak of the kindness of mother and child.\nFrom \"Yinghuo guards the west\" to the following eight lines describe the stern command of the father.\nThose who \"do not grasp the principle\" and \"seek famous medicines far and wide\" are practitioners of external alchemy.\n\"By kind compare with kind\" refers to the earlier mention of the \"Eight Stones as the proper guiding principle.\"\n\nErect a pole and see its shadow; call into a valley and hear its echo.\nHow can this not be wondrous? It is the supreme image of heaven and earth.\nYet if one takes a mere inch of wild aconite or a tael of croton and swallows it, one will instantly stiffen, unable to turn or look up.\nAt such a time, even if King Wen of Zhou were to massage, if Master Cao were to divine, if Confucius were to read the omens, if Bian Que were to apply his needles, or if Wu Xian were to beat his drums,\nhow could they revive the dead or restore them to running and walking?\n\nThe maiden by the River He is numinous and most divine.\nWhen fire is applied, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.\nGhosts hide and dragons conceal themselves—none know where she resides.\nIf one wishes to control her, the Yellow Sprout is the root.\n\nThings lack yin and yang; they defy heaven and contravene the origin.\nA fat hen hatches from an egg, yet her chick is not whole.\nWhy is this? Because the union was not complete, the Three and Five did not interact, and hardness and softness were separated.\nThe essence of transformation is the natural process of heaven and earth.\nJust as fire moves upward when kindled and water flows downward when poured,\nthere is no teacher to instruct them thus—it is the governance of the origin, which cannot be altered.\n\nObserve the moment when male and female mate: hard and soft bind together and cannot be separated.\nWhen the proper timing aligns, there is no need for craft or control.\nWhen a boy is born, he lies prone; when a girl is born, she lies supine—\nthey receive this from the womb and the qi of their primal beginning.\nThis is not only visible at birth but also evident at death, when they return to the same posture.\nThis is not taught by parents; it is determined at the moment of union, fixed from the very beginning.\n\nThe Kan male is the moon; the Li female is the sun.\nThe sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light.\nThe moon receives the sun’s transformation and its body is not harmed.\nIf yang loses its contract, yin encroaches upon its brightness.\nAt new moon and full moon, they press close and eclipse one another.\nYang’s form is consumed; yin overreaches and brings disaster.\n\nMale and female depend on one another, containing and exhaling to nourish.\nMale and female intermingle, seeking their kind.\nMetal transforms into water, and water’s nature circulates freely.\nFire transforms into earth, and water cannot flow.\nThus the male moves and acts externally; the female is still and stores internally.\nIf one exceeds the proper measure, one is constrained by the female.\nThe po restrains the hun, preventing excess and extravagance.\nNeither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating at the proper time,\neach attains harmony, and both emit the confirming sign.\n\nThe analogy of poisonous medicines killing people illustrates how the Yellow Sprout can control the maiden by the River He.\n\"External alchemy\" here refers to cinnabar, though it is unclear what this specifically denotes.\n\nFrom \"Things lack yin and yang\" onward, all pertains to the principles of things, clarifying that for this method, the union of yin and yang is fundamental.\nThe essence of cinnabar is wood; only when it meets metal do they merge.\nWhere metal and water unite, wood and fire take the lead.\nThese four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger.\nThe dragon is yang, with an odd number; the tiger is yin, with an even number.\nThe liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother.\nThe kidneys, black, are the child; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor.\nThese three things form one family, all returning to wu and ji.\nHard and soft arise in succession, traversing the divisions in turn.\n\nThe dragon is in the west, the tiger in the east; they establish the weft at mao and you.\nPunishment and virtue meet, and upon encountering one another, they react with fear or joy.\nPunishment governs restraint and killing; virtue governs generation and arising.\nIn the second month, the elm dies, and the *Kui* star descends upon mao.\nIn the eighth month, wheat sprouts, and the *Tiancheng* star occupies you.\nZi is south, wu is north, each serving as the guiding principle for the other.\nThe numbers nine and one cycle endlessly, beginning anew after completion.\n\nEmbracing the origin and holding fast to the true, one spreads essence into the child.\n*\"Guan guan go the ospreys, on the islet in the river.\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous young lady—\nFor our prince a good mate she.\"*\nThe male does not dwell alone;

They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces to conceal themselves in obscurity. Nurturing essence and cultivating spirit, they harmonized virtue with the Three Origins. Through the regulation of essence and fluids, sinews and bones became firm. All perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided constantly. Through long accumulation, they altered their forms and became immortals.\n\nGrieving for later generations who cherished the Dao, they followed the winds of precedent, tracing and illustrating ancient texts. They composed diagrams and writings to enlighten posterity, revealing branches while concealing roots. They entrusted names to stones, veiling their teachings beneath layers of texts. Scholars who obtained these works guarded them in caskets all their lives. Sons inherited their fathers’ pursuits, tracing back to ancestral origins. Yet through generations of transmission, confusion prevailed, and none perceived the truth. Thus, officials failed in their duties, farmers abandoned their plows, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars of resolve fell into poverty.\n\nDeeply pained by this, I have definitively recorded these writings. The words are concise and easily pondered; the matters are simple and unburdensome. Unfolding them reveals their order, and their substance may be examined. Weights and measures are precise, allowing for systematic progression. Thus, I have composed disordered verses, leaving openings like the holes of a flute. The wise will reflect carefully and infer their meaning.\n\nThe immortals of old wrote books to instruct others but did not speak plainly of their methods. They assigned names to stones as symbols for the yin and yang within the body, causing many scholars to lose the true intent. Now, in composing this book, I have made it simple and clear, yet still fear its secrets may be exposed. Therefore, I have included many misleading and chaotic phrases, leaving openings like the holes of a flute.\n\nThe following verses further distill the essential meaning of the text:\n\n*No image is greater than Heaven and Earth,*\n*The dark ravine spans ten thousand li.*\n*The River Drum faces the Star Marker,*\n*And the people are all struck with terror.*\n*The sundial’s shadow advances and retreats in vain,*\n*For nine years, calamity befalls.*\n*The sovereign gazes upon it,*\n*And the king retreats to reform himself.*\n*The pivot rises and falls,*\n*And the harmful qi flees in haste.*\n*The Jiang and Huai run dry,*\n*As waters pour into the sea.*\n\nThis passage speaks of the calamity of flooding. If the king reforms himself, the harmful qi will cease, and the waters and earth will be at peace. The \"dark ravine\" likely refers to the Celestial River. The \"River Drum\" is a star’s name. The \"Star Marker\" corresponds to the *chou* position, though its meaning here is unclear. The \"nine years\" allude to the Great Flood. The \"rising and falling pivot\" refers to the ascent and descent of yin and yang. The \"harmful qi\" signifies the qi of disaster; by analogy to the human body, it also represents the imbalance of water and fire. Master Zhu said: The \"dark ravine\" and \"harmful qi\" may not refer to matters within the human body but are rather metaphorical expressions. The *Biography of Wang Mang* states: \"The harmful qi is about to be exhausted.\" The preceding text describes the disaster of flooding, and if the king reforms, the harmful qi departs, and the floodwaters subside. The character for \"harm\" was corrupted into *zhou*, then further corrupted into *gu*, leading later scholars to mistakenly emend it to *essence* and add the word *and*, both of which are incorrect. However, the corruption into *zhou* reveals its original form as *harm*, for the seal and clerical scripts resemble one another.\n\n*Heaven and Earth, female and male,*\n*Wander between zi and wu.*\n*Yin and yang’s ancestors at yin and shen,*\n*Emerge and enter, completing their cycles.*\n*Following the Dipper and the Celestial Pivot,*\n*Grasping the crossbeam to fix the primordial order.*\n*Ascending to roast on Mount Zeng,*\n*With flames spreading below.*\n*The White Tiger leads the way,*\n*While the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *Tiger* is also written as *Ku* or *Fan*. These three are all provisional names. Since the following line speaks of \"Azure Fluid,\" it would be fitting to use *Ku* or *Fan* here. Earlier texts mention *Ku* and *Ci*, so *Ku* would be appropriate. However, the subsequent line mentions the Vermilion Bird and lists the positions of the Three Beasts, so this should be *Tiger*, and *Fluid* should be *Dragon*. The \"leading the way\" refers to the earlier-mentioned \"roasting pivot.\" The phrase \"harmonizing behind\" follows from this. Both seem to refer to sentient beings, so *Dragon* and *Tiger* are appropriate.\n\nThis passage expresses the idea of refining water with fire, extinguishing fire with water, and the union of metal and water, returning to the original state.\n\n*The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,*\n*Its radiance displaying five colors.*\n*Encountering the spread of nets,*\n*It is pressed down and cannot rise.*\n\nAh, the wailing cries so mournful—\nLike an infant longing for its mother.\nTumbled into the seething cauldron,\nFeathers and scales crushed and broken.\nBefore half the clepsydra’s measure has passed,\nDragon-scales surge and writhe in tumult.\nFive-hued images dazzle and gleam,\nShifting forms with no constant master.\n□□ the crucible’s seething rush,\nBoiling over without cease.\nJumbled, heaped in tangled layers,\nLike interlocking fangs they clash.\nShaped like midwinter’s ice,\nRailing forth stalactites of frost.\nTowering, crammed in chaotic mass,\nPiled together to prop each other up.\nYin and Yang find their match,\nSerene and still, each guarding the other.\n\nThe Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six,\nSpring blossoms flourishing in the east at *Mao*.\nThe White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven,\nAutumn’s awns glistening in the west at *You*.\nThe Vermilion Bird abides in Spread Two,\nTrue Yang blazing in the south at *Wu*.\nAll three come to pay homage,\nTheir kin now bound as dear companions.\nOriginally but two things,\nYet in the end they become three and five.\nThree and five merge into one,\nAll gathered to return to two places.\nRefining them by the method above,\nCount the days as prescribed.\nFirst white, then yellow,\nRed hue permeating both within and without.\nThis is called the First Crucible,\nIts grains as large as great millet.\nHere again is the essence of the Returned Elixir,\nIts vital points distilled.\n\n*Zi-Wu* denotes *Qian* and *Kun*;\n*Yin-Shen* denotes *Kan* and *Li*.\n*Ascending and roasting*—this is the \"roasting pivot.\"\n*Steaming in submission*—White Tiger (Metal), Azure Dragon (Water), Vermilion Bird (Fire):\nMetal gives birth to Water, Water extinguishes Fire to form the Elixir,\nIts form as previously described—first fluid, then congealed, like horse-teeth railing forth.\nThe wailing cries so mournful—\nAs before, the ceaseless toil of day and night.\nYin and Yang finding their match,\nSerene and still, each guarding its domain—\nThis is what was meant by \"each guarding its boundary, each dwelling alone.\"\n\n*Chamber*, among the seven eastern lodges;\n*Six*, its degree.\n*Pleiades Seven* and *Spread Two* follow likewise.\nThe *two things* refer to Yin and Yang.\nThe *three and five*—Fire, Metal, and Wood, all endowed with Earth’s *qi*.\n*Merging into one*—upon close reading, this should be rendered as such.\n*Two places* and *prescribed count*—their meanings remain obscure.\n\nSuch is the work of Nature,\nNo false or devious path.\nMountain and marsh *qi* steam together,\nRising as clouds to become rain.\nMud dries to dust,\nFire’s end becomes earth.\nLike the yellow dye of *nie*,\nOr indigo transformed to green silk.\nTrue hide turns to glue,\nFerment and yeast become wine.\nKindred natures yield effortlessly,\nUnlike seeds that resist craft.\n\nOf this wondrous art alone,\nExamine it closely—no deceitful words.\nTransmitted to countless generations hence,\nIts brilliance clear and verifiable.\nShining like stars across the Milky Way,\nVast as the sea’s ancestral waters.\nPonder it until it is thoroughly mastered,\nTurning it over again and again.\nAfter a thousand cycles, resplendent and bright,\nTen thousand repetitions will reveal its truth.\nThe divine may speak to one,\nOr the soul suddenly awaken.\nTrace its threads to their source,\nAnd you will find the gate and door.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none,\nYet it is ever passed to the worthy.\nThe text’s pointers are clear—\nIf the scholar reads it a thousand times, ten thousand times,\nUnderstanding will come as if the divine had spoken.\nDong Yu said: \"Read a book a thousand times, and its meaning will appear of itself.\"\nAgain he said: \"Ponder it, ponder it, and ponder again;\nIf pondering fails, ghosts and spirits will teach you—\nNot by their power, but by the extremity of your spirit.\"\nNo false words here.\n\n**Five Correlations**\nThis chapter comprises five sections:\n1. *Can Tong* (The Kinship of the Three)\n2. *Tai Yi* (The Great Change)\n3. *Xiang Bi* (Resembling That)\n4. *Kuai Tu* (The Kuai Diagram)\n5. *Wei Shi* (Entrusting the Times)\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* expounds broadly,\nYet cannot maintain purity or unity;\nIts subtleties remain incomplete,\nGaps and omissions like scattered mist.\nNow I have compiled and supplemented,\nFilling lacunae, polishing obscurities,\nDrawing connections to bridge the distance,\nHarmonizing intent, ensuring no contradictions.\nThus I have composed this,\nEntitled *Five Correlations*—\nFor the *Great Change* encompasses all,\nIts nature and essence fully expressed.\n\nThe nature and essence of the *Great Change*\nEach adheres to its measure.\nThe teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi probe deeply,\nRefined and ready for application.\nThe work of the furnace and fire is truly grounded:\nThree paths from one, all emerging from the same road.\nBranches, stems, flowers, leaves,\nFruits hanging in abundance—\nYet all depend on the root,\nNever losing their original purity.\n\nThe words spoken with sincerity are examined and without error.\nLike the mid-winter solstice, when bamboo and trees wither and decay,\nAssisting yang to instruct merchants and travelers,\nThe lord deeply conceals himself.\nFollowing the seasons and adhering to the celestial cycles,\nOne seals the mouth and refrains from speech.\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless,\nThe *Great Mystery* without form or appearance.\nEmpty and still, it cannot be perceived,\nIts boundaries dissolving into nothingness.\nErrors and missteps lose the thread of affairs,\nWords return to harm oneself.\nI distinguish and arrange these *Four Images*\nTo enlighten later generations, blind as they are.\nThese words speak of the interval between darkness and dawn,\nThe time of primordial chaos, when forms lie hidden.\nThe *Great Mystery* in its original formlessness,\nThe highest virtue like water,\nThe image of the *True One*, difficult to depict.\n\nThe *Four Images* remain obscure.\nA rustic from the state of Kuai, a withered scholar from a secluded valley—\nMaster Zhu says: \"Lord Wei was in fact from Shangyu; it should read *Kuaiji*.\nPerhaps Wei used *Yu* as a veiled reference.\"\nHe embraced simplicity and plainness,\nUnmoved by power or glory.\nDwelling in obscurity and humble quarters,\nHe disregarded fame and renown.\nHolding fast to tranquility and detachment,\nHe longed for an era of peace and stability.\nA wanderer in distant Yan, he composed this text,\nSinging of the *Great Change*, the legacy of the Three Sages.\nExamining its purport,\nAll is unified in a single order.\nIts purpose lies in following principle,\nIlluminating the spirit.\nThrough spiritual transformation, all flows freely,\nBringing peace to the four seas.\nPresented as a calendar for all ages,\nA path for ten thousand generations to follow.\nArranged to govern the realm,\nIts practice is effortless.\nDrawing inward to cultivate nature,\nAligning with the naturalness of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.\nAbundant in virtue and power,\nReturning to the root, reverting to the origin.\nIt lies near in my heart,\nNever apart from this very body.\nEmbracing the One without release,\nOne may endure forever.\nPaired with dietary practices,\nYin and yang are arrayed.\nRefined cinnabar from Wudu,\nThe eight minerals cast aside.\nCarefully applied, they bring success,\nCherished by the worldly.\nThree paths are laid out,\nBranches and stems interconnected.\nSame in origin yet different in name,\nAll emerge from a single gate.\nNot merely an accumulation of lines,\nBut harmonious and refined prose.\nIndeed, it holds truth,\nIts coarse grains worthy of contemplation.\nIf I were to embellish falsehoods,\nI would only incur superfluous faults.\nEntitled *The Kinship of the Three*,\nIts subtleties glimpsed at the outset.\nFew words yet profound meaning,\nLater generations ought to uphold it.\nAbandoning the times to avoid harm,\nTaking refuge in the mountains and hills.\nWandering the vast and desolate,\nNeighboring ghosts and spirits.\nTransforming form to become immortal,\nMerging into silence without sound.\nOnce in a hundred generations,\nRoaming among mortals.\nSpreading wings like a bird,\nSoaring east, west, south, and north.\n\nTang endured hardship,\nDrought and flood dividing the land.\nBranches and leaves withered and yellow,\nLosing their flourishing splendor.\nThe virtuous support one another,\nSecure and steadfast, they may attain long life.\n\n**Ode to the Cauldron**\nThree and five in a circle, one *cun* and one *fen*.\nThe mouth four and eight, the lips two *cun*.\nTwo *chi* in length, thickness evenly distributed.\nThe belly three *qi*, seated and warmly suspended.\n*(Two chi, or perhaps one chi and two; Peng Xiao interprets it as two chi.\nThree qi, or perhaps qi three.)*\n*(Note: Qi here means navel.)*\nYin above, yang rushing below.\nThese two lines are the essential method.\nHead and tail martial, the center civil.\nYin fire white, yellow lead of the teeth.\nThe two sevens’ orifices assist and support.\nGallbladder, principle, brain—settling the ascent of the *Mystery*.\nThe child resides in the center, secure and preserved.\nComing and going in play, never leaving the gate.\nGradually growing great, nature and disposition pure.\nReturning to the One, reverting to the original source.\nAfter one full cycle, the toil is intense.\nGuard it closely, do not fall into confusion.\nThe path is distant, the depths profoundly mysterious.\nIf you attain this, you will comprehend Heaven and Earth.\nThose who delight in the Dao seek its root.\nExamine the five phases, determine the weights and measures.\nContemplate it carefully, no need for debate.\nGuard it deeply, do not transmit it in writing.\n\nMount the white crane, ride the dragon’s scales.\nRoam the Great Void, pay homage to the Immortal Lord.\nReceive the celestial chart, be named a *True Person*.\n\n**Eulogy**\n*The Kinship of the Three* is crude in language yet vast in Dao,\nSubtle in speech yet profound in meaning.\nIt arrays the Five Emperors to establish enterprise,\nAligns with the Three Sovereigns to govern the realm.\nIf lord and minister diverge in rank,\nHigh and low lack standard,\nOrdering governance by this,\nPeace will not be attained.\n\nPracticing its methods through ingestion does not grant immortality; studying it to cultivate one’s nature does not prolong life. Yet when it comes to dissecting yin and yang, balancing their weights and measures, observing the waxing and waning of the moon, and forming images from the eight trigrams—when male and female interact, when hardness and softness move and rest, when grains and salts are apportioned—all is attested by the classics, and the intent is vigorous indeed. Thus, laws were established to transmit this to later worthies. Only those who comprehend the Great Image will surely attain longevity; those who strengthen themselves and benefit their bodies through this Dao must apply their minds with utmost care.\n\nThis appears to be the preface to a commentary, written by a later hand, for the original commentary is lost while the preface remains. The term \"establishing laws\" here refers to composing the commentary, with the characters altered through transcription errors.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Some call it the *Postface*, others the *Eulogy of Master Wei*. Its content and intent clearly mark it as the postface to the commentary. Peng Xiao’s preface states that Master Wei secretly showed it to Xu, an official in Qingzhou, instructing him to annotate it; Xu concealed his name and wrote the commentary. This may well be Xu’s own words, for the commentary itself no longer survives.\n\nThe *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* was composed by Wei Boyang. Master Wei lived during the Later Han. The title of the work likely imitates the style of apocryphal texts, its language and rhymes ancient, profound, and difficult to grasp. Superficial readers have rashly altered it, resulting in more errors than in other texts. Now, collating various versions to correct and align them, many passages remain obscure and unresolved; what is known has been compiled into a definitive edition. All variants are preserved here to aid further verification.\n\nBy Kongtong Daoist Zou Xin.\n\n*Note*: The name \"Zou Xin\" was borrowed by Master Zhu as a pseudonym. \"Zou\" was originally the state of Zhu in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. In the *Record of Music*, \"Heaven and Earth rejoice in union,\" Zheng’s commentary reads: \"‘Rejoice’ should be ‘radiance.’\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: According to the *Wei Shu*, the text begins with the four trigrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* as the bellows and furnace; next, it discusses the sixty trigrams from *Zhun* to *Meng* to illustrate the progression of daily practice; then, it addresses the six *Na Jia* trigrams to show the waxing and waning of monthly practice; finally, it presents the twelve sovereign trigrams, dividing the six *Na Jia* trigrams into pairs. Internally, it details the lunar phases, while externally, it encompasses the workings of the year—this is how it draws upon the *Yi* for its explanations, without ever mentioning the three hundred eighty-four lines.\n\nThe fire-times methods transmitted today take the three hundred eighty-four lines as the count for one celestial cycle, assigning one line per day. Since the lines outnumber the days, four trigrams and twenty-four lines are omitted, to be gradually added upon the arrival of the twenty-four solar terms. This already deviates from the natural harmony of the system. Moreover, the lines used each day, whether yin or yang, follow no fixed order, making it unclear how the practice distinguishes stages. Furthermore, within a single day, the count completes a full cycle of three hundred sixty, yet only one line is added per solar term—disproportionate in weight and measure. The twenty-four additions increase gradually, while reductions are abrupt, lacking the rhythm of cyclical ebb and flow. This is likely a later invention, not Master Wei’s original intent.\n\nThe central focus of this work lies in the two trigrams *Kan* and *Li*. If one grasps their essential principles, the timing and progression of practice—unaddressed by Master Wei—can be deduced through reason. As long as the periods of advance and retreat are not misaligned, one may proceed without rigid adherence to old interpretations. Thus, I have devised a method based on counting the stalks, which appears orderly and rational. Though Master Wei did not mention it, this approach is rough but grounded in principle.\n\nThe year is divided into twelve trigrams, each governing two and a half days. Each trigram’s lines are matched with its corresponding stalk count. From the *Guan* trigram in the eighth month to the *Tai* trigram in the first month, yang uses twenty-eight stalks of youth, and yin uses twenty-four stalks of age. From the *Dazhuang* trigram in the fourth month to the *Pi* trigram in the seventh month, yang uses thirty-six stalks of age, and yin uses twenty-two stalks of youth. Yang flows with focused attention, while yin rests in profound stillness. One line suffices to represent one cycle of opening and closing qi. The twelve trigrams of rest complete one month’s work, and twelve months complete one year’s cycle, repeating endlessly without surplus or deficit. The calculations are illustrated in a diagram, which I intended to discuss with Jitong, but before I could send it, he passed away.\n\nNote: Given the constraints, annotations marked with # in the original (e.g., #1, #2) are preserved as part of the text but not expanded upon, as they refer to variant characters or textual notes rather than translatable content.\n\n---\n\nObserve: In his earlier works, Master Zhu never followed the crowd or carelessly attached himself to the followers of the sages. For instance, he regarded the *Book of Changes of the Hemp-Clad Master* as a work by Dai Shiyu and the *Book of Changes of Guan Ziming* as a forgery by Ruan Yi. Such was his rigor in transmitting truth. Yet, concerning the *Cantong Qi*, he uttered not a single word of doubt or suspicion. Moreover, his exegesis of the *Book of Changes* drew heavily from Master Shao. He himself remarked: \"Master Shao’s insights derive from [Chen] Xiyi, whose lineage traces back to the *Cantong Qi*.\" Thus, he accorded it the highest esteem.\n\nHe once said: \"I see it all so clearly in my mind’s eye, yet I find no place to begin.\" Again, he stated: \"Only now do I grasp its general outline, but I have yet to fathom its workings or key points.\" In the *ding-si* year of the Qingyuan era (1207), when Cai Jitong was assigned to Daozhou, they parted ways. Jitong stayed the night at Hanquan, and together they collated the *Cantong Qi* through the night without sleep. Alas! Such was the bond between master and disciple—unshaken even in adversity—that they devoted themselves so earnestly to the *Cantong*. Their resolve to transcend worldly conventions was thus firmly settled.\n\nThe following year, Jitong passed away. Later, I obtained the method of stalk calculations, but regretted that I could not discuss it with him. Two years thereafter, the Master himself departed. Nevertheless, the two texts—the *Cantong Qi* and the *Yinfu Jing*—were first transmitted by this master and disciple, and their teachings do not contradict those of the sages. Thus, they are trustworthy. For this reason, I have compiled this work, placing them after the *Taiji* and *Xiantian* diagrams. How could there be any doubt?\n\nThe *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume Three, concludes.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix by Huang Ruijie of Luling:**\nThe *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, as recorded in the *Preface to the Exegesis* by Peng Xiao of the Five Dynasties period, states: Wei Boyang, a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji, cultivated the Dao in seclusion, nurturing his will in emptiness and non-being. Proficient in literature and versed in apocrypha, he obtained the *Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its profound principles. Thereupon, he synthesized the *Book of Changes* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters, later adding a supplementary chapter, *Supplementing Omissions and Rectifying Errors*. His exposition often employs allegory and metaphor, veiling and revealing meaning through varied diction.\n\nHe secretly imparted it to Xu, an Attendant in Qingzhou, who then concealed his name to annotate it. During the reign of Emperor Huan, Boyang transmitted it to his fellow townsman, Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it circulated in the world. *Can* means \"to intermingle\"; *tong*, \"to unify\"; *qi*, \"to harmonize\"—signifying that its principles align and harmonize with those of the *Book of Changes*. The text borrows the analogy of ruler and minister to elucidate inner and outer, pairs the *Li* and *Kan* trigrams to directly indicate mercury and lead, arrays the *Qian* and *Kun* trigrams to establish the measure of the cauldron, and clarifies them as father and mother. It preserves the beginning and end, unites husband and wife to constrain their union, compares them to male and female to manifest generation, analyzes them into yin and yang, guides them through cycles of reversal, illustrates them with the dark and new moons, connects them to ascent and descent, pairs them with the hexagrams and lines to manifest transformation, follows the handle of the Dipper, adopts the circumpolar stars, divides them into dawn and dusk, and illuminates them with the clepsydra. All these are expounded through the imagery of the *Book of Changes*; hence, it is titled the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.\n\nAccording to the *Cantong Qi*, there exist nineteen annotated editions in thirty-one volumes, as cataloged in Zheng Qiao’s *Bibliographic Treatise* under the *Yiwen Lue*. Peng Xiao’s edition is the most widely transmitted. However, he divided the three volumes into ninety chapters to correspond with the yang nine, and appended the *Song of the Cauldron* as one chapter to match the water one. Such forced parallels are of this nature. This imitates the division of the *Laozi* into the Upper and Lower Canons of eighty-one chapters by the Master of the River, though in truth, it is not so.\n\nMr. Bao remarked: Peng’s edition, altered by shallow scholars of recent times, contains errors and omissions in both palace archives and private copies, leaving one at a loss as to which to follow. Master Zhu examined and corrected the text, citing evidence to establish its authentic version. I dare not further encumber it with extraneous interpretations.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The *Cantong Qi* was not originally intended to elucidate the *Book of Changes*. It merely borrows the method of *na jia* to embed its guidelines for practice and retreat. In the past, I often wished to study it, but lacking transmission, I could find no entry point and dared not lightly discuss it. However, its *na jia* method is the same as the divination technique of Jing Fang transmitted today, as seen in the *Fire Pearl Forest*. The references to *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* pertain to the moon’s appearances at dusk and dawn, not to the division of the six hexagrams by direction.\"\n\nThough this was not established to elucidate the *Book of Changes*, the *Changes* encompasses all things. If it forms a coherent system of its own, capable of being extended and understood, then it poses no harm to the *Changes*.\n\nMaster Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* may trace its lineage to the teachings of Master Xiyi. The Precelestial Chart corresponds with the *na yin* system, and Cai Jitong observed its alignment with the *Cantong Qi*. Viewed through the chart: *Kun* holds the interval of *Fu* as the new moon; *Zhen* marks the third day, when the first yang arises; the eighth day is *Dui*, the moon’s first quarter; the fifteenth day is *Qian*; the eighteenth day is *Xun*, when the first yin arises; the twenty-third day is *Gen*, the moon’s last quarter. *Kan* and *Li* represent the sun and moon, hence they are not used. The *Cantong Qi* takes *Kan* and *Li* as the elixir, while the rest serve as the firing times.\n\nMaster Shao expounded the Precelestial Chart, which was transmitted from Master Xiyi, who in turn received it from an earlier lineage. These were the techniques of the fangshi, employed in cultivation—precisely what the *Cantong Qi* describes.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* is exquisitely written, likely composed by a master of prose from the Later Han. Its diction is rooted in ancient texts, beyond the comprehension of modern readers, which is why it has been so widely misinterpreted. Numerous versions circulate, one of which states:\n*A thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing—*\n*Ten thousand transformations will then be witnessed.*\n*At times the numinous may reveal itself to man—*\n*Suddenly the soul awakens in sudden enlightenment.*\nThrough prolonged recitation, the essential meaning and key principles naturally emerge.\n\nMaster Liu of Xuqi remarked: \"Among ancient texts, only the *Cantong Qi* resembles pre-Qin prose.\"",

Also known as *The Kinship of the Three in Accordance with the Zhouyi: Textual Variants* or *Annotations on the Kinship of the Three in Accordance with the Zhouyi*. Compiled by Zhu Xi of the Song dynasty. The base text includes supplementary notes by Huang Ruijie, a later scholar of Luling. Three fascicles. Base text source: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Supreme Mystery Section. Collated with the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* edition, Subsection of Daoist Works under the Classics Division (hereafter *Siku* edition).\n\n---\n\n### *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One\n**Supplementary Notes by Huang Ruijie of Luling**\n\n#### **Upper Chapter**\nQian and Kun are the gate and portal of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams. When speaking of Qian and Kun in relation to the cosmos, Qian (Heaven) is above and Kun (Earth) below, with all things between them. Kun’s yin is below, completing the cycle—this is the gate and portal of the *Yi*. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li as the enclosing frame, with Qian’s form as the northern inquiry. Through the transformations of yin and yang, when speaking of the human body, all things begin and end with Qian’s yang above, while the yin and yang of the body and the transformations of the myriad things all occur within it. Thus, Qian and Kun are the parents of all hexagrams, all pointing to the transformations of yin and yang. This is what is called the great elixir of golden cinnabar. Its furnace and crucible, then, are Kan and the enclosing frame, which turn the hub and align the axle. Kun occupies the positions above and below, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them—this is the *Yi*. The positions of the primordial Heaven are: Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, and Kan in the west. Thus, their image is like a walled enclosure; their ascent and descent are like an axle piercing the hub to turn the wheel, descending once and ascending once. The hub is solid on the outside to hold the spokes, while the crossbar beneath the carriage, passing through the hub at both ends to receive the linchpin, is Kun. The heart of the carriage wheel, hollow within to receive the axle, is Qian. The axle is the interlocking of the four trigrams of the female and male. The female and male refer to the four paired trigrams: Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen. The *qi* is the sack, and the *yue* is its tube. In the method of *na jia*, Qian is the full moon, Kun is the new moon, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them. Zhen governs the waxing light, Dui the first quarter; Xun governs the waning light, Gen the last quarter—like the tension and release of a drum’s strap.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Shaozi remarked, “Qian and Kun establish the positions above and below; Kan and Li arrange the gates to the left and right.” The hexagram positions in the *Cantong Qi* are all of the same principle. They encompass the Dao of yin and yang, like a skilled charioteer who holds the reins and bit, follows the inked line, and adheres to the wheel tracks. By abiding in the center to govern the external, the calculations are recorded in the pitch pipes and calendar. This speaks of the human heart’s ability to govern yin and yang, turning the hub and axle to refine the elixir. The reins and bit are what regulate yin and yang; the inked line refers to the firing times; the wheel tracks indicate the paths of ascent and descent; the center is the heart; the external is qi; and the calculations refer to the sixty hexagrams’ firing times below.\n\nThe lunar phases have five or six divisions; warp and weft serve the sun’s command. Combined, they make sixty, with firm and yielding having inner and outer aspects. The moon takes five days as one phase, six phases as one cycle. Combining day and night makes sixty, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams. Day is firm, night is yielding; firm is the inner, yielding the outer. Among the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—which serve as the furnace, crucible, elixir, and firing times—only sixty hexagrams remain.\n\nAt dawn, *Zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *Meng* receives its turn. Each day and night governs one hexagram, used in proper sequence. This is the general pattern of the sixty hexagrams. One month completes one cycle, referring to the timing of daily practice at dawn and dusk. From *Ji Ji* to *Wei Ji* until the break of dawn, the end returns to a new beginning. The celestial stems and branches set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late. *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* refer to the hexagrams of the dark moon: *Ji Ji* at dawn and *Wei Ji* at dusk. *Shuang* refers to the time of waxing light.\n\nSpring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. Autumn and winter employ the outer, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Spring and summer refer to dawn; autumn and winter to dusk. The inner body refers to the preceding hexagram; the outer to the following hexagram. This is also part of the pattern of the sixty hexagrams. In the later chapter, *Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*, while *Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*, fully expounding the *na jia* method. Generally, the times used in a single day are merely the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The line statements contain benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accordance with the seasons. Thus, in harmony with the four seasons, the five phases attain their proper order. This speaks of the differences in practice between dawn and dusk, though the details remain unclear.\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and Earth are Qian and Kun. Establishing positions refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang’s pairings. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. This cites the *Yi* and explains it to clarify the functions of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—speaking of Qian above and Kun below, Li descending and Kan ascending. The two functions of Qian and Kun refer to Qian’s use of nine and Kun’s use of six. Nine is old yang; six is old yin. The two functions have no fixed line positions, circulating through the six voids. Their coming and going neither ascend nor descend, nor do they have constancy. Hidden and submerged, they rise and fall within. They envelop the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao. By the insubstantial governing the substantial, the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness. Thus, in tracing waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish and perish. Qian and Kun’s two hexagrams have six lines: nine, “use nine,” and “use six” have no fixed positions. Each of the six has its position, yet the nine and six of the six lines are the circulation and ascent-descent of these nine and six.",

      "translated_text": "The method involves Qian receiving *jia* and *ren*, Kun receiving *yi*, *gui*, and *geng*, while Xun receives *xin* in ascent and descent. Knowing that vessels have form, Gen receives *bing*, and Dui receives *ding* in their positions. Kan receives *wu*, and Li receives *ji*, for the yin and yang of the six hexagrams. Thus, by this primal [principle], only Zhen’s reception of *jia* has a fixed position, while all else has none. This is the circulation of the middle lines of Kan and Li, governing the substantial through the insubstantial; their function lies precisely in the emptiness of form. This aligns with the *Laozi*’s saying of \"hollowing out clay to make a vessel,\" where the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.\n\nThe waxing of *xiao-xi* passes through Zhen and Dui to culminate in Qian; its waning begins in Kun and moves through Xun and Gen to culminate in Kun. Their vanishing is the absence of position. The later passage on \"use nine\" in fluttering succession, as the ancestral teaching of the *Yi*, carries this same meaning.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Someone asked whether the *Cantong Qi* was originally the *Longhu Shangjing*. He replied: Not so. Later scholars, seeing that Wei Boyang’s transmission mentioned a *Longhu Shangjing*, fabricated this text. Most of it is cobbled together from the *Cantong Qi*’s phrases, though some explanations are mistaken. For instance, the \"two functions\" refer to \"use nine\" and \"use six,\" where nine and six are also Kan and Li. The \"six voids\" are the six line positions of Qian and Kun—initial, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top. Though the two functions have no fixed line positions, they constantly circulate through the six lines of Qian and Kun, like the essence and *qi* of a person, ascending and descending throughout the body without fixed abode. The *Longhu Jing*, however, mistakenly equates this with the voids of *Xu* and *Wei*, grasping at straws to force a connection.\n\nAccording to Peng’s account, Wei Gong obtained the *Guwen Longhu Jing* and mistook it for the *Cantong Qi*. Master Zhu, however, believed the text to be a later forgery. Upon examination, the *Cantong Qi* contains ancient passages on the dragon and tiger, such as the *Huoji*, which may have existed in antiquity but are not the versions transmitted today. Bao’s view likens it to the *Sanfen Shu* or *Hushou Jing*, though this remains uncertain.\n\nFurther, the *Jinbi Guwen Longhu Shangjing* is somewhat simpler than the *Cantong Qi*, yet its arrangement and phrasing are not far removed, appearing more orderly. Its closing line, \"The *Huoji* is not falsely made,\" echoes the *Qi*’s own words. Thus, the *Huoji* may well be the source of the *Cantong Qi*. Words are not idly crafted; theories do not arise without basis. Evidence is drawn from the young, and calculations align with the numinous. By analogy and structural analysis, principles are verified.\n\nKan’s *wu* is the essence of the moon; Li’s *ji* is the radiance of the sun. Sun and moon constitute the *Yi*, with firm and yielding in balance. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Blue, red, white, and black each occupy their directions, all receiving the power of the central palace, the work of *wu* and *ji*. This is also the method of constructing characters, clarifying how Kan’s moon and Li’s sun unite to form the *Yi*. For Kan’s *wu* and Li’s *ji* both reside in the central palace of earth, while the four directions and four phases all derive their *qi* from it.\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery, and no imagery is more luminous than the sun and moon. To fathom the numinous and know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives. Like spokes converging on a wheel’s hub, they turn in alternation, emerging and receding, coiling and uncoiling. This summarizes the *Yi* as embodied by the sun and moon. Below, the text elaborates on the method and the fire phases of a single month.\n\nFrom the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this time, heaven and earth mingle their essence, sun and moon clasp each other. The male yang scatters dark essence; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, and the root’s foundation is planted. Nurturing the bud, concentrating spirit, the body takes form. All things tread forth from this, and no movement is not born of it.\n\nThus, Confucius praised the primal chaos, where the virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the void. Investigating antiquity, he spoke of the primordial sovereign; the *Guanwei* established the beginning. The marriage knot of *qi* is tied, and in the first year, the sprout flourishes. The sage is not born in vain; he observes above to manifest the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, adapting to the times with sincerity and trust.",

      "translated_text": "This method of the text divides one month into six segments, each governed by one of the six hexagrams: *Zhen* (☳) as the first, *Dui* (☱) the second, *Qian* (☰) the third, *Xun* (☴) the fourth, *Gen* (☶) the fifth, and *Kun* (☷) the sixth. Each segment spans five days, so it is said that on the first day of the lunar month, *Zhen* begins its influence, marking the initial interaction of the sun and moon’s yin and yang. Here, one applies the work of cultivation, just as the sage composed the Six Classics, each with its foundational origin. This is indeed the essential teaching of the entire passage. The lines *\"the male yang scatters dark essence; the female yin transforms the yellow womb\"* are the crux of this segment, while all else serves to elucidate this point.\n\nThus, the *Book of Changes* embodies the heart of heaven, and the hexagram *Fu* (☳, Return) establishes the first sprout. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to lay the foundation. Waxing and waning respond to the pitch pipes, rising and descending follow the pivot of the Dipper. Here, the month is further divided into twelve segments, arranged in the sequence of *Fu* (☳, Return), *Lin* (☷☴, Approach), *Tai* (☰☷☴, Peace), *Zhuang* (☰☰☴, Strength), *Guai* (☰☰☱, Breakthrough), *Qian* (☰☰☰, Creative), *Gou* (☷☰☰, Coming to Meet), *Dun* (☷☰☱, Retreat), *Pi* (☷☰☷, Standstill), *Guan* (☷☴☷, Contemplation), *Bo* (☷☶☷, Splitting Apart), and *Kun* (☷☷☷, Receptive), with each segment spanning two and a half days. *Fu* is the inner essence of the *Zhen* hexagram in the previous six-segment division. The eldest son is *Zhen*; the father is *Qian*; the mother is *Kun*. A later passage states: *\"On the first day of the lunar month, it is *Fu*.\"* On the third day, the moon emerges as clarity, *Zhen* receiving the *geng* position in the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, and the first quarter moon appears as straight as a cord. On the fifteenth day, the body of *Qian* is complete, full and radiant in the *jia* position of the east.\n\nThe toad and the hare’s essence—sun and moon’s *qi* shine as one. The toad, associated with the hexagram’s segments, and the hare, which spits forth light, describe the full moon’s complete reception of sunlight. The toad symbolizes gazing, the hare symbolizes emission. When the seventh and eighth days pass, the moon bends and descends. On the sixteenth day, it turns to receive new governance, *Xun* in *xin* appearing at dawn. *Gen* aligns with the south in *bing*, and on the twenty-third day, the last quarter moon appears. On the thirtieth day, *Kun* in *yi* loses its light in the northeast. The segments conclude and succeed one another; the inherited body gives birth to the dragon anew. *Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*, while *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.\n\nThe \"seven and eight\" refer to the fifteenth day. The sixteenth day marks the start of the fourth segment, where the first yin begins to form as *Xun*, completing the lunar essence, setting at dawn in the west at *xin*. On the twenty-third day, the middle of the fifth segment, the central yin arises as *Gen*, forming the last quarter moon, setting at midday in the south at *bing*. On the thirtieth day, the end of the sixth segment, all three yang transform, and the light vanishes as the moon’s body hides in the northeast—here, the character *ming* (brightness) is borrowed from *Peng* (☷☷☷) in the *Book of Changes*. When the six segments of the month are complete, they pass the succession to the following month. The eldest son inherits the father’s role, and *Zhen* is reborn. *Ren* pairs with *jia*, *gui* with *yi*, all belonging to *Qian* and *Kun*, encompassing the ten-day cycle’s beginning and end. From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, this completes one month’s regimen of firing times.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"In the space of a single breath, there are already the dark of the moon, the new moon, the quarters, and the full moon. The first quarter is the *qi*’s moment of growth, descending from above. The last quarter is the *qi*’s moment of decline, ascending from below. The full moon is the *qi*’s fullness, when the sun sinks below and the moon rounds above. Between the dark and new moon, the sun and moon conjoin in the heavens—this is like using water to extinguish fire, or metal returning to its original nature.\"*\n\nThe numbers seven and eight make fifteen, while nine and six also correspond. These four combine to make thirty, when the yang *qi* is exhausted and hidden away. The *ba gua* array the celestial luminaries, their movements never losing the center. The subtle essence of the mysterious is difficult to fathom; one must infer and verify through signs. In stillness, observe its images and model its forms. Set up standards as a guide, and divine auspices to determine good or ill fortune. Issue decrees in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment when the lines move.\n\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, sequence the flows of earth’s forms. In the middle, investigate human nature, and harmonize the Three Powers through mutual consideration. In action, follow the hexagram’s segments; in stillness, rely on the *Xiang*’s words. When *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice, the world is then governed. Here, *\"Qian and Kun are put into practice\"* refers to *\"using nine\"* and *\"using six\"*—*\"governed\"* may also be written as *\"ordered,\"* likely to avoid a Tang taboo.\n\nWhat follows, down to *\"the state’s origin harms the Dao,\"* uses governance as a metaphor. How can one not be cautious in the first principles of ruling? Bind fast the subtle and profound, open and spread the treasures. The essential Dao holds the handle of authority, unifying transformation’s guiding threads. When the lines stir within, good and ill fortune arise without. The five planets move in harmony or discord, responding to the times with resonance. When the four and seven fall into disorder, extravagance and decline follow in their wake. The *Wenchang* oversees the records, while the Three Dukes are held accountable. The hundred officials and their bureaus each govern their respective domains. The sun harmonizes the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew. Trace the beginning to grasp the end, for therein lies the thread of survival or ruin.\n\nIf the ruler is arrogant and indulgent, overbearing and deviating from the Dao; if the minister is deceitful and flattering, acting outside the proper path—then the waxing and waning of the moon, its fullness and contraction, will fall into disorder and misfortune. Those who enforce the law must admonish and criticize, binding faults and shifting blame to the ruler. The Pole Star receives its correctness, at ease and entrusting matters below. The Bright Hall enacts governance, yet the state’s origin harms the Dao. These are all metaphorical expressions, yet within them lie details worthy of careful reflection.\n\nInwardly, cultivate the self through tranquility and emptiness. The primordial root hides or reveals itself, inwardly illuminating the body’s form. Seal the *Dui* (mouth), and fortify the numinous root.",

Investigating antiquity, he spoke of the primordial sovereign; the *Guanwei* established the beginning. The marriage knot of *qi* is tied, and in the first year, the sprout flourishes. The sage is not born in vain; he observes above to manifest the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, adapting to the times with sincerity and trust.",

Three and five merge to form eight.\nEight represents the mineral image, yet in truth, there are but two things—water and fire—\nwith earth as the master.\nEarth pertains to the spleen, which governs intention, meaning the mind directs fire downward and water upward,\nbreathing in harmony.\nGold is fire. The Vermilion Bird likely refers to the heart, also the master of intention.\n\"Holding the balance\" means wielding the scale, governing summer.\nThis text’s intent largely concerns refining water with fire, diminishing fire with water—\nechoing the earlier theme of the moon receiving the sun’s light and returning to its mother.\n\nSesame still extends life; returning cinnabar enters the mouth.\nGold’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things.\nWhen alchemists ingest it, their lifespan endures long.\nEarth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.\nGolden sand enters the five viscera, mist scattering like wind and rain.\nSteaming and permeating the four limbs, the complexion becomes radiant and fair.\nWhite hair reverts to black as of old.\nThe elderly man regains his youth; the old woman becomes a maiden.\nTransforming form to escape worldly calamity, one is called a True Person.\n\nThis speaks of the inner elixir yet describes it as if taken by mouth.\nIts meaning remains unclear.\nElsewhere, I have seen it rush into the crimson gate below.\n\nLead powder cast into fire, its color ruined, reverts to lead.\nIce and snow met with warm broth dissolve into the Great Mystery.",

the formless is difficult to attain.\n*Yin* here means they themselves awakened to this principle through their teachers.\nThe two lines on the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* remain unclear.\n\nThe *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters share the same aim.\nThough their words are earnest, people do not ponder them deeply.\nTracing their origins and flows, the hidden and manifest originally dwell together.\nI await the discourse of the worthy—how dare I lightly commit this to writing?\nHolding my tongue, I wish to remain silent, yet to cut off the Dao invites punishment.\nPouring my thoughts onto bamboo and silk, I fear leaking heaven’s tally.\nHesitant, I sigh, gazing up and down, stitching together this foolishness.\nThough the potter’s wheel has its methods, I cannot bear to lay it all bare.\nI sketch only its outlines; its branches and leaves will be seen in the refining.\n\nThe *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters—an ancient text now lost, its details unknown.\nUse gold as the embankment, and water and fire move freely.\nGold’s number is fifteen; water’s number is the same.\nWhen measuring at the furnace, let water exceed by five parts.\nTake these two as true, gold’s weight as originally set.\nThe third does not enter; fire’s two parts accompany them.\nThe two substances contain and receive one another, their transformations wondrous as spirits.\nAt once, the qi of Great Yang arises, steaming and seething in an instant.\nFirst liquid, then congealed, it is called the Yellow Chariot.\nThis speaks of the first transformation of the elixir.\nGold and water appear above.\n*Enter* should read *fire*, as below there are three things—thus it should be *fire*.\nYet it also says \"the qi of Great Yang arises below,\" which seems to involve only two things.\nPerhaps it should read *eight*, and *three* should be *two*.\nThis refers to gold and water, both numbered fifteen, with water divided into five parts, only two used—six of fifteen.\nThe three are nine of fifteen.\nWater’s two parts—some read *fire’s two*—correspond to the three things of water and fire above.\nBut above there is no mention of fire’s weight, and below the word *Great Yang* appears, so this may not be the case.\nThe two substances containing and receiving one another are the union of yin and yang, Kan and Li.\nThe error of *three things* is quite clear.\n\nAs the years and months near their end, nature is harmed and lifespan shortened.\nThe body becomes ash and earth, its form like bright dust in a vessel.\nThis seems to describe the second transformation.\nPound, refine, and combine them, then rush into the crimson gate.\nSecurely seal their meeting, striving for perfect solidity.\nBlazing fire spreads below, its sound ceaseless day and night.\nAt first, civil methods are employed; in the end, martial ones are displayed.\nObserve with care, scrutinizing the adjustments of cold and warmth.\nCycle through the twelve nodes; when each ends, inspect closely again.\nQi wanes, life nears its end, rest and death claim the hun and po.\nThe color shifts to purple, resplendent, forming the Returned Elixir.\nGround to a single pill, the spatula’s touch is most divine.\nThis is the third transformation.\n*Pounding, refining, and combining*—this must involve some other process.\nThe *crimson gate* refers to the mouth.\nWhen liquid congeals to ash and earth, the principle becomes self-evident:\nit is spat out, refined, then swallowed again.\nThe *blazing fire* is the aforementioned qi of Great Yang.\n*Its sound ceaseless*—later chapters also speak of a mournful, wailing sound, like an infant longing for its mother.\n*Civil* may be a scribal error for *cultivate*; Tang-era texts often confuse the two.\n*Qi wanes, life nears its end*—this echoes the earlier idea of fire extinguished and gold restored.\n*Ground to a pill, spatula’s touch*—the details remain unclear.\n\nExpounding the numbers of the five phases, concise yet not cumbersome:\nUse water to stimulate fire, and suddenly its brilliance is extinguished.\nSun and moon press close, ever dwelling between darkness and dawn.\nWhen water prevails, Kan encroaches on yang;

      "translated_text": "**Middle Scroll**\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun,\npaired and embracing each other.\nYang bestows, yin receives—\nmale and female depend on one another.\nThrough this, creation unfolds,\nand essence and qi expand.\nKan and Li crown the head,\nradiance spreading forth.\nThe profound and obscure are hard to fathom,\nbeyond depiction in diagrams.\nThe sage measures and weighs,\narranging the foundations of the mysterious.\nThe four blend into chaos,\nentering directly into emptiness and nothingness.\nThe sixty-four hexagrams cycle,\nspread out as a chariot.\nDragon and horse are harnessed,\nthe enlightened ruler steers the times.\nIn harmony, they follow—\nthe path is level, not deviant.\nDeviant ways are perilous and treacherous,\ntoppling nations into danger.\nThis mirrors the first chapter of the preceding scroll.\n\nThe noble one dwells in his chamber;\nwhen his words are good,\nthey resonate a thousand *li* away.\nThis speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots,\nabiding in his nine-fold chamber,\nissuing decrees and commands,\naligning with the seasons of yin and yang,\nstoring instruments and awaiting the hour,\nnever transgressing the days of the hexagrams.\n*Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*;\n*Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams\neach have their own days.\nI briefly set forth the two images,\nthough I cannot exhaust their details.\nEstablish righteousness and enact punishments,\napply benevolence and bestow virtue.\nThose who oppose meet misfortune;\nthose who comply find fortune.\nFollow the calendar and decrees,\nwith utmost sincerity and focus.\nCarefully observe the days and hours,\nscrutinizing waxing and waning.\nEven the slightest deviation\nbrings regret and harm.\nAt the solstices, the measures change,\ndeviating and twisting.\nMidwinter brings scorching heat,\nmidsummer sees sleet and snow.\nAt the equinoxes, all is askew,\nnot even a moment’s delay.\nWind and rain fail to follow their seasons,\nflood and drought contend.\nLocusts surge like boiling water,\nmountains collapse and the earth splits.\nHeaven displays its omens,\nmyriad anomalies arise on all sides.\nThe filial son’s devotion\nmoves the imperial pole.\nNear at hand, it begins with his own words;\nafar, it flows to distant lands.\nSome bring calamity,\nsome bring blessings.\nSome usher in great peace,\nsome incite war and upheaval.\nThe coming of these four\nstems from the heart’s intent.\nMovement and stillness have their constancy—\nadhere to their guiding line.\nThe four seasons follow their proper course,\nharmonizing with qi.\nFirmness and softness are distinct,\nnever encroaching upon one another.\nThe Five Phases guard their boundaries,\nnever recklessly expanding or contracting.\nThe *Yi* flows in cycles,\nbending and stretching, reversing and repeating.\nThis mirrors the preceding scroll’s discussion of *Zhun* and *Meng*,\ntheir morning and evening, inner essence and outer application.\n\nNow, Qian receives *jia* and *ren*,\nKun receives *yi* and *gui*;\nZhen receives *geng*,\nXun receives *xin*;\nKan receives *wu*,\nLi receives *ji*;\nGen receives *bing*,\nDui receives *ding*.\n\nThe method of doubling the hexagrams:\nQian’s lower three lines receive *jiazi*, *yin*, *chen*;\nits upper three lines receive *renwu*, *shen*, *xu*.\nKun’s lower three lines receive *yiwei*, *si*, *mao*;\nits upper three lines receive *guichou*, *hai*, *you*.\nZhen’s lower three lines receive *gengzi*, *yin*, *chen*;\nits upper three lines receive *gengwu*, *shen*, *xu*.\nXun’s lower three lines receive *xinchou*, *hai*, *you*;\nits upper three lines receive *xinwei*, *si*, *mao*.\nKan’s lower three lines receive *wuyin*, *chen*, *wu*;\nits upper three lines receive *wushen*, *xu*, *zi*.\nLi’s lower three lines receive *jimao*, *chou*, *hai*;\nits upper three lines receive *jiyou*, *wei*, *si*.\nGen’s lower three lines receive *bingchen*, *wu*, *shen*;\nits upper three lines receive *bingxu*, *zi*, *yin*.\nDui’s lower three lines receive *dingsi*, *mao*, *chou*;\nits upper three lines receive *dinghai*, *you*, *wei*.\n\nThus, the inner essence ranges from *zi* to *chen* and *si*,\nwhile the outer application spans from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\nTherefore, in the morning *Zhun*,\nthe first yang line, *gengzi*, corresponds to the *zi* hour;\nthe fourth yin line, *wushen*, corresponds to the *mao* hour.\nIn the evening *Meng*,\nthe first yin line, *wuyin*, corresponds to the *wu* hour;\nthe fourth yin line, *wuxu*, corresponds to the *you* hour.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams\nare deduced by this method.\nThis again speaks of the fire-phase within a single day.\n\nBetween the last and first days of the lunar month,\nthe tally aligns and moves within.\nChaos and vastness,\nfemale and male follow one another.\nNourishing fluids moisten and enrich,\ntransformation flows and circulates.\nHeaven and earth’s spirits\nare beyond measure.\nEmploy them to secure the body,\nconcealing form and hiding away.\nIt begins in the northeast,\nthe region of *Ji* and *Dou*.\nTurning rightward,\nit spews forth sprouts like a wheel.\nHidden depths reveal their image,\ndispersing radiant essence.\nAbove *Bi* and *Xu*,\nZhen emerges as the omen.\nYang qi begins its inception—\nthe first yang, the hidden dragon.\nYang is established in threes,\nyin flows in eights.\nThus, on the third day, Zhen stirs;\non the eighth day, Dui proceeds.\nThe second yang, the visible dragon,\nis peaceful and bright.\nWhen the virtues of three and five are complete,\nthe body of Qian is formed.\nThe third yang, ever vigilant at dusk,\nloses and breaks the divine tally.\nProsperity and decline gradually shift,\nultimately returning to their origin.\nXun continues the lineage,\nfirmly securing and upholding.\nThe fourth yang may leap,\nadvancing and retreating on a perilous path.\nGen governs progression and pause,\nunable to seize the moment.\nOn the twenty-third day,\nit holds fast to the crescent phase.\nThe fifth yang, the flying dragon,\nascends to heaven’s position with joy.\nThe fifth yin, Kun’s reception,\nbinds and completes the beginning and end.\nNurturing the multitude of offspring,\nit becomes the mother of all kinds.\nYang’s numbers are exhausted—\nonce complete, they rise again.\nFollowing nature and uniting with essence,\nthey turn and join together.\nThe ninth yang, the overbearing dragon,\nbattles virtue in the wilds.\nUsing the nine, they soar lightly,\nbecoming the compass and square of the Dao.\nFollowing the revolving jade armillary,\nascending and descending, rising and falling.\nFlowing through the six lines,\nit is hard to observe and perceive.\nThus, the primal constant position\nis the ancestral founder of the *Yi*.\nThis again speaks of the fire-phase within a month\nthrough the reception of Qian’s six lines,\nilluminating the waxing and waning of yang qi.\n\n*Ji* and *Dou* refer only to the northeast,\n*Bi* and *Xu* only to the west—\nborrowing heaven’s four directions\nto speak of earth’s four directions,\nnot meaning heaven’s east, north, or west.\n\nThe twenty-sixth day is likely a misprint for \"twenty.\"\n\"Twenty\" is pronounced *ru*, meaning twenty.\nOn the twenty-sixth day, awaiting the hour,\nthe hexagram *Kun* governs.\nThe *Use of the Nine* and below\nmirror the preceding scroll’s discussion of the two uses of Qian and Kun.",

It is the supreme image of heaven and earth.\nYet if one takes a mere inch of wild aconite or a tael of croton and swallows it, one will instantly stiffen, unable to turn or look up.\nAt such a time, even if King Wen of Zhou were to massage, if Master Cao were to divine, if Confucius were to read the omens, if Bian Que were to apply his needles, or if Wu Xian were to beat his drums,\nhow could they revive the dead or restore them to running and walking?\n\nThe maiden by the River He is numinous and most divine.\nWhen fire is applied, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.\nGhosts hide and dragons conceal themselves—none know where she resides.\nIf one wishes to control her, the Yellow Sprout is the root.\n\nThings lack yin and yang; they defy heaven and contravene the origin.\nA fat hen hatches from an egg, yet her chick is not whole.\nWhy is this? Because the union was not complete, the Three and Five did not interact, and hardness and softness were separated.\nThe essence of transformation is the natural process of heaven and earth.\nJust as fire moves upward when kindled and water flows downward when poured,\nthere is no teacher to instruct them thus—it is the governance of the origin, which cannot be altered.\n\nObserve the moment when male and female mate: hard and soft bind together and cannot be separated.\nWhen the proper timing aligns, there is no need for craft or control.\nWhen a boy is born, he lies prone; when a girl is born, she lies supine—\nthey receive this from the womb and the qi of their primal beginning.\nThis is not only visible at birth but also evident at death, when they return to the same posture.\nThis is not taught by parents; it is determined at the moment of union, fixed from the very beginning.\n\nThe Kan male is the moon; the Li female is the sun.\nThe sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light.\nThe moon receives the sun’s transformation and its body is not harmed.\nIf yang loses its contract, yin encroaches upon its brightness.\nAt new moon and full moon, they press close and eclipse one another.\nYang’s form is consumed; yin overreaches and brings disaster.\n\nMale and female depend on one another, containing and exhaling to nourish.\nMale and female intermingle, seeking their kind.\nMetal transforms into water, and water’s nature circulates freely.\nFire transforms into earth, and water cannot flow.\nThus the male moves and acts externally; the female is still and stores internally.\nIf one exceeds the proper measure, one is constrained by the female.\nThe po restrains the hun, preventing excess and extravagance.\nNeither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating at the proper time,\neach attains harmony, and both emit the confirming sign.\n\nThe analogy of poisonous medicines killing people illustrates how the Yellow Sprout can control the maiden by the River He.\n\"External alchemy\" here refers to cinnabar, though it is unclear what this specifically denotes.\n\nFrom \"Things lack yin and yang\" onward, all pertains to the principles of things, clarifying that for this method, the union of yin and yang is fundamental.\nThe essence of cinnabar is wood;

      "translated_text": "**Lower Scroll**\n\nIn ancient times, the sagely awakened embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true. They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces to conceal themselves in obscurity. Nurturing essence and cultivating spirit, they harmonized virtue with the Three Origins. Through the regulation of essence and fluids, sinews and bones became firm. All perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided constantly. Through long accumulation, they altered their forms and became immortals.\n\nGrieving for later generations who cherished the Dao, they followed the winds of precedent, tracing and illustrating ancient texts. They composed diagrams and writings to enlighten posterity, revealing branches while concealing roots. They entrusted names to stones, veiling their teachings beneath layers of texts. Scholars who obtained these works guarded them in caskets all their lives. Sons inherited their fathers’ pursuits, tracing back to ancestral origins. Yet through generations of transmission, confusion prevailed, and none perceived the truth. Thus, officials failed in their duties, farmers abandoned their plows, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars of resolve fell into poverty.\n\nDeeply pained by this, I have definitively recorded these writings. The words are concise and easily pondered; the matters are simple and unburdensome. Unfolding them reveals their order, and their substance may be examined. Weights and measures are precise, allowing for systematic progression. Thus, I have composed disordered verses, leaving openings like the holes of a flute. The wise will reflect carefully and infer their meaning.\n\nThe immortals of old wrote books to instruct others but did not speak plainly of their methods. They assigned names to stones as symbols for the yin and yang within the body, causing many scholars to lose the true intent. Now, in composing this book, I have made it simple and clear, yet still fear its secrets may be exposed. Therefore, I have included many misleading and chaotic phrases, leaving openings like the holes of a flute.\n\nThe following verses further distill the essential meaning of the text:\n\n*No image is greater than Heaven and Earth,*\n*The dark ravine spans ten thousand li.*\n*The River Drum faces the Star Marker,*\n*And the people are all struck with terror.*\n*The sundial’s shadow advances and retreats in vain,*\n*For nine years, calamity befalls.*\n*The sovereign gazes upon it,*\n*And the king retreats to reform himself.*\n*The pivot rises and falls,*\n*And the harmful qi flees in haste.*\n*The Jiang and Huai run dry,*\n*As waters pour into the sea.*\n\nThis passage speaks of the calamity of flooding. If the king reforms himself, the harmful qi will cease, and the waters and earth will be at peace. The \"dark ravine\" likely refers to the Celestial River. The \"River Drum\" is a star’s name. The \"Star Marker\" corresponds to the *chou* position, though its meaning here is unclear. The \"nine years\" allude to the Great Flood. The \"rising and falling pivot\" refers to the ascent and descent of yin and yang. The \"harmful qi\" signifies the qi of disaster; by analogy to the human body, it also represents the imbalance of water and fire. Master Zhu said: The \"dark ravine\" and \"harmful qi\" may not refer to matters within the human body but are rather metaphorical expressions. The *Biography of Wang Mang* states: \"The harmful qi is about to be exhausted.\" The preceding text describes the disaster of flooding, and if the king reforms, the harmful qi departs, and the floodwaters subside. The character for \"harm\" was corrupted into *zhou*, then further corrupted into *gu*, leading later scholars to mistakenly emend it to *essence* and add the word *and*, both of which are incorrect. However, the corruption into *zhou* reveals its original form as *harm*, for the seal and clerical scripts resemble one another.\n\n*Heaven and Earth, female and male,*\n*Wander between zi and wu.*\n*Yin and yang’s ancestors at yin and shen,*\n*Emerge and enter, completing their cycles.*\n*Following the Dipper and the Celestial Pivot,*\n*Grasping the crossbeam to fix the primordial order.*\n*Ascending to roast on Mount Zeng,*\n*With flames spreading below.*\n*The White Tiger leads the way,*\n*While the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *Tiger* is also written as *Ku* or *Fan*. These three are all provisional names. Since the following line speaks of \"Azure Fluid,\" it would be fitting to use *Ku* or *Fan* here. Earlier texts mention *Ku* and *Ci*, so *Ku* would be appropriate. However, the subsequent line mentions the Vermilion Bird and lists the positions of the Three Beasts, so this should be *Tiger*, and *Fluid* should be *Dragon*. The \"leading the way\" refers to the earlier-mentioned \"roasting pivot.\" The phrase \"harmonizing behind\" follows from this. Both seem to refer to sentient beings, so *Dragon* and *Tiger* are appropriate.\n\nThis passage expresses the idea of refining water with fire, extinguishing fire with water, and the union of metal and water, returning to the original state.\n\n*The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,*\n*Its radiance displaying five colors.*\n*Encountering the spread of nets,*\n*It is pressed down and cannot rise.*",

      "translated_text": "Practicing its methods through ingestion does not grant immortality; studying it to cultivate one’s nature does not prolong life. Yet when it comes to dissecting yin and yang, balancing their weights and measures, observing the waxing and waning of the moon, and forming images from the eight trigrams—when male and female interact, when hardness and softness move and rest, when grains and salts are apportioned—all is attested by the classics, and the intent is vigorous indeed. Thus, laws were established to transmit this to later worthies. Only those who comprehend the Great Image will surely attain longevity; those who strengthen themselves and benefit their bodies through this Dao must apply their minds with utmost care.\n\nThis appears to be the preface to a commentary, written by a later hand, for the original commentary is lost while the preface remains. The term \"establishing laws\" here refers to composing the commentary, with the characters altered through transcription errors.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Some call it the *Postface*, others the *Eulogy of Master Wei*. Its content and intent clearly mark it as the postface to the commentary. Peng Xiao’s preface states that Master Wei secretly showed it to Xu, an official in Qingzhou, instructing him to annotate it; Xu concealed his name and wrote the commentary. This may well be Xu’s own words, for the commentary itself no longer survives.\n\nThe *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* was composed by Wei Boyang. Master Wei lived during the Later Han. The title of the work likely imitates the style of apocryphal texts, its language and rhymes ancient, profound, and difficult to grasp. Superficial readers have rashly altered it, resulting in more errors than in other texts. Now, collating various versions to correct and align them, many passages remain obscure and unresolved; what is known has been compiled into a definitive edition. All variants are preserved here to aid further verification.\n\nBy Kongtong Daoist Zou Xin.\n\n*Note*: The name \"Zou Xin\" was borrowed by Master Zhu as a pseudonym. \"Zou\" was originally the state of Zhu in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. In the *Record of Music*, \"Heaven and Earth rejoice in union,\" Zheng’s commentary reads: \"‘Rejoice’ should be ‘radiance.’\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: According to the *Wei Shu*, the text begins with the four trigrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* as the bellows and furnace; next, it discusses the sixty trigrams from *Zhun* to *Meng* to illustrate the progression of daily practice; then, it addresses the six *Na Jia* trigrams to show the waxing and waning of monthly practice; finally, it presents the twelve sovereign trigrams, dividing the six *Na Jia* trigrams into pairs. Internally, it details the lunar phases, while externally, it encompasses the workings of the year—this is how it draws upon the *Yi* for its explanations, without ever mentioning the three hundred eighty-four lines.\n\nThe fire-times methods transmitted today take the three hundred eighty-four lines as the count for one celestial cycle, assigning one line per day. Since the lines outnumber the days, four trigrams and twenty-four lines are omitted, to be gradually added upon the arrival of the twenty-four solar terms. This already deviates from the natural harmony of the system. Moreover, the lines used each day, whether yin or yang, follow no fixed order, making it unclear how the practice distinguishes stages. Furthermore, within a single day, the count completes a full cycle of three hundred sixty, yet only one line is added per solar term—disproportionate in weight and measure. The twenty-four additions increase gradually, while reductions are abrupt, lacking the rhythm of cyclical ebb and flow. This is likely a later invention, not Master Wei’s original intent.\n\nThe central focus of this work lies in the two trigrams *Kan* and *Li*. If one grasps their essential principles, the timing and progression of practice—unaddressed by Master Wei—can be deduced through reason. As long as the periods of advance and retreat are not misaligned, one may proceed without rigid adherence to old interpretations. Thus, I have devised a method based on counting the stalks, which appears orderly and rational. Though Master Wei did not mention it, this approach is rough but grounded in principle.\n\nThe year is divided into twelve trigrams, each governing two and a half days. Each trigram’s lines are matched with its corresponding stalk count. From the *Guan* trigram in the eighth month to the *Tai* trigram in the first month, yang uses twenty-eight stalks of youth, and yin uses twenty-four stalks of age. From the *Dazhuang* trigram in the fourth month to the *Pi* trigram in the seventh month, yang uses thirty-six stalks of age, and yin uses twenty-two stalks of youth. Yang flows with focused attention, while yin rests in profound stillness. One line suffices to represent one cycle of opening and closing qi. The twelve trigrams of rest complete one month’s work, and twelve months complete one year’s cycle, repeating endlessly without surplus or deficit. The calculations are illustrated in a diagram, which I intended to discuss with Jitong, but before I could send it, he passed away.",

      "translated_text": "Note: Given the constraints, annotations marked with # in the original (e.g., #1, #2) are preserved as part of the text but not expanded upon, as they refer to variant characters or textual notes rather than translatable content.\n\n---\n\nObserve: In his earlier works, Master Zhu never followed the crowd or carelessly attached himself to the followers of the sages. For instance, he regarded the *Book of Changes of the Hemp-Clad Master* as a work by Dai Shiyu and the *Book of Changes of Guan Ziming* as a forgery by Ruan Yi. Such was his rigor in transmitting truth. Yet, concerning the *Cantong Qi*, he uttered not a single word of doubt or suspicion. Moreover, his exegesis of the *Book of Changes* drew heavily from Master Shao. He himself remarked: \"Master Shao’s insights derive from [Chen] Xiyi, whose lineage traces back to the *Cantong Qi*.\" Thus, he accorded it the highest esteem.\n\nHe once said: \"I see it all so clearly in my mind’s eye, yet I find no place to begin.\" Again, he stated: \"Only now do I grasp its general outline, but I have yet to fathom its workings or key points.\" In the *ding-si* year of the Qingyuan era (1207), when Cai Jitong was assigned to Daozhou, they parted ways. Jitong stayed the night at Hanquan, and together they collated the *Cantong Qi* through the night without sleep. Alas! Such was the bond between master and disciple—unshaken even in adversity—that they devoted themselves so earnestly to the *Cantong*. Their resolve to transcend worldly conventions was thus firmly settled.\n\nThe following year, Jitong passed away. Later, I obtained the method of stalk calculations, but regretted that I could not discuss it with him. Two years thereafter, the Master himself departed. Nevertheless, the two texts—the *Cantong Qi* and the *Yinfu Jing*—were first transmitted by this master and disciple, and their teachings do not contradict those of the sages. Thus, they are trustworthy. For this reason, I have compiled this work, placing them after the *Taiji* and *Xiantian* diagrams. How could there be any doubt?\n\nThe *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume Three, concludes.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix by Huang Ruijie of Luling:**\nThe *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, as recorded in the *Preface to the Exegesis* by Peng Xiao of the Five Dynasties period, states: Wei Boyang, a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji, cultivated the Dao in seclusion, nurturing his will in emptiness and non-being. Proficient in literature and versed in apocrypha, he obtained the *Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its profound principles. Thereupon, he synthesized the *Book of Changes* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters, later adding a supplementary chapter, *Supplementing Omissions and Rectifying Errors*. His exposition often employs allegory and metaphor, veiling and revealing meaning through varied diction.\n\nHe secretly imparted it to Xu, an Attendant in Qingzhou, who then concealed his name to annotate it. During the reign of Emperor Huan, Boyang transmitted it to his fellow townsman, Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it circulated in the world. *Can* means \"to intermingle\"; *tong*, \"to unify\"; *qi*, \"to harmonize\"—signifying that its principles align and harmonize with those of the *Book of Changes*. The text borrows the analogy of ruler and minister to elucidate inner and outer, pairs the *Li* and *Kan* trigrams to directly indicate mercury and lead, arrays the *Qian* and *Kun* trigrams to establish the measure of the cauldron, and clarifies them as father and mother. It preserves the beginning and end, unites husband and wife to constrain their union, compares them to male and female to manifest generation, analyzes them into yin and yang, guides them through cycles of reversal, illustrates them with the dark and new moons, connects them to ascent and descent, pairs them with the hexagrams and lines to manifest transformation, follows the handle of the Dipper, adopts the circumpolar stars, divides them into dawn and dusk, and illuminates them with the clepsydra. All these are expounded through the imagery of the *Book of Changes*; hence, it is titled the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.\n\nAccording to the *Cantong Qi*, there exist nineteen annotated editions in thirty-one volumes, as cataloged in Zheng Qiao’s *Bibliographic Treatise* under the *Yiwen Lue*. Peng Xiao’s edition is the most widely transmitted. However, he divided the three volumes into ninety chapters to correspond with the yang nine, and appended the *Song of the Cauldron* as one chapter to match the water one. Such forced parallels are of this nature. This imitates the division of the *Laozi* into the Upper and Lower Canons of eighty-one chapters by the Master of the River, though in truth, it is not so.\n\nMr. Bao remarked: Peng’s edition, altered by shallow scholars of recent times, contains errors and omissions in both palace archives and private copies, leaving one at a loss as to which to follow. Master Zhu examined and corrected the text, citing evidence to establish its authentic version. I dare not further encumber it with extraneous interpretations.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The *Cantong Qi* was not originally intended to elucidate the *Book of Changes*. It merely borrows the method of *na jia* to embed its guidelines for practice and retreat. In the past, I often wished to study it, but lacking transmission, I could find no entry point and dared not lightly discuss it. However, its *na jia* method is the same as the divination technique of Jing Fang transmitted today, as seen in the *Fire Pearl Forest*. The references to *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* pertain to the moon’s appearances at dusk and dawn, not to the division of the six hexagrams by direction.\"",

      "translated_text": "Though this was not established to elucidate the *Book of Changes*, the *Changes* encompasses all things. If it forms a coherent system of its own, capable of being extended and understood, then it poses no harm to the *Changes*.\n\nMaster Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* may trace its lineage to the teachings of Master Xiyi. The Precelestial Chart corresponds with the *na yin* system, and Cai Jitong observed its alignment with the *Cantong Qi*. Viewed through the chart: *Kun* holds the interval of *Fu* as the new moon; *Zhen* marks the third day, when the first yang arises; the eighth day is *Dui*, the moon’s first quarter; the fifteenth day is *Qian*; the eighteenth day is *Xun*, when the first yin arises; the twenty-third day is *Gen*, the moon’s last quarter. *Kan* and *Li* represent the sun and moon, hence they are not used. The *Cantong Qi* takes *Kan* and *Li* as the elixir, while the rest serve as the firing times.\n\nMaster Shao expounded the Precelestial Chart, which was transmitted from Master Xiyi, who in turn received it from an earlier lineage. These were the techniques of the fangshi, employed in cultivation—precisely what the *Cantong Qi* describes.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* is exquisitely written, likely composed by a master of prose from the Later Han. Its diction is rooted in ancient texts, beyond the comprehension of modern readers, which is why it has been so widely misinterpreted. Numerous versions circulate, one of which states:\n*A thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing—*\n*Ten thousand transformations will then be witnessed.*\n*At times the numinous may reveal itself to man—*\n*Suddenly the soul awakens in sudden enlightenment.*\nThrough prolonged recitation, the essential meaning and key principles naturally emerge.\n\nMaster Liu of Xuqi remarked: \"Among ancient texts, only the *Cantong Qi* resembles pre-Qin prose.\"",

In the past, I often wished to study it, but lacking transmission, I could find no entry point and dared not lightly discuss it. However, its *na jia* method is the same as the divination technique of Jing Fang transmitted today, as seen in the *Fire Pearl Forest*. The references to *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* pertain to the moon’s appearances at dusk and dawn, not to the division of the six hexagrams by direction.\"",
