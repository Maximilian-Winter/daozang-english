  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Jade Purity of the Nine Empyreans, Great Brahmā of the Purple Tenuity, and Mystic Capital Thunder Rites Jade Sūtra*\n\n**Sūtra Title:** *The Supreme Jade Purity of the Nine Empyreans, Great Brahmā of the Purple Tenuity, and Mystic Capital Thunder Rites Jade Sūtra*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Division, *Benwen* Category\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in the Dragon Han Era’s first year, the year of *Sheti Ge*. The Great Ultimate had just unfolded, and the Three Powers were established.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy dwelt in the midst of the Vast Court of the Empyrean Heavens, expounding upon the primordial chaos and unfolding the vastness of the Great Void. A numinous wind sighed through the air, jade forests swayed gently, auspicious clouds suffused the sky, and the myriad forms fell silent.\n\nThen the Great Dao Lord of the Jade Imperial Court and the Most High Lord Lao stood in attendance. The Most High Lord Lao spoke with his heart’s voice: \"Since the beginningless kalpas of old, what roots of goodness did I plant, what fruits of cultivation did I perfect, that I might transcend the Three Realms, ascend to the Jade Purity Heaven, and become the Teacher of Humans and Devas? Revered by the Three Realms, I assist above in the transformation of the Great Veil’s Primordial Beginning and below in the flourishing of the Shangqing and Lingbao traditions. Through countless kalpas, I have encountered such fortune—yet my form remains unexpressed in words.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Do not harbor such doubts. The Great Dao Lord of the Jade Imperial Court shall elucidate for you—attend closely.\"\n\nThe Great Dao Lord of the Jade Imperial Court, having received the Heavenly Worthy’s command, first bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, then saluted the Heavenly Sovereign.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy sat upon a chariot of nine jades, soaring rosy clouds, and the luminous radiance of the Azure Void. The Heavenly Sovereign attended beside him, seated upon a palanquin of eightfold numinous rosy dawns. The Dao Lord stood to the Heavenly Worthy’s right, seated upon a chariot of jade clouds, feathered empyreans, brocade mists, and the great azure.\n\nThe myriad heavens of the ten directions each bore palanquins of verdant forests and feathered voids, floating canopies, and great cinnabar flying immortals with five-colored clouds and scattered luminosities. Among them were chariots of empyrean numina and flowing jade glows, great immortals with eyes like jade orbs; chariots of purple auroras, solar brilliance, and feathered wings; banners of nine-jointed dancing immortals; standards of embryonic spirits and the eightfold purity; pennants of ninefold rosy clouds; and flags of threefold clouds. Eight phoenixes sang in the void, nine *luan* birds chanted Brahmanic hymns. Immortal attendants of the left bore clouds, those of the right bore rosy mists. The vast music of the Celestial Spheres arrayed to left and right, with feathered robes and rainbow skirts performed in succession. When the celestial music concluded, the tenfold radiance shone clearly, and the four seasons’ airs settled into clarity.\n\nThe Dao Lord then ascended his chariot of jade blossoms and ninefold immortals’ pristine origin. Raising his jade tablet, he saluted the immortals, his gaze sweeping across the myriad heavens. Serene and at ease, he sighed softly, then turned to Lord Lao and said: \"You abide in the wondrous expanse of the Great Clarity’s realm, dwelling in the court of the Great Possession. Humans and devas gaze upon you, dragons and spirits revere you. The Five Thearchs prostrate in homage, and the myriad immortals attend in welcome. Yet you do not take pride in your glory but instead humble yourself, diligently reflecting upon the profound. Why should you deign to hear my words? I shall expound for you—you ought to awaken.\"\n\nLord Lao descended from his chariot and bowed before the Jade Imperial Lord, saying: \"I regard the Primordial Beginning as my father and you, my elder brother. Thus, I understand without words, know without translation. Yet I remain humble and diligent, troubling you to examine my heart. I beg your celestial majesty’s indulgence—let me unfold my own account.\"\n\nLord Lao returned to his seat, raised his scepter of golden light and sixfold luminous rosy mists, faced the Heavenly Worthy, then turned to the Dao Lord, and manifested his mighty power.\n\nAt that moment, heaven and earth trembled. Black clouds spread thickly, divine winds roared through the sky, mountains flew and peaks raced. Ten thousand dragons leapt, lightning and fire intertwined. Cloud masters cried out ahead, rain riders howled behind. The great winter drums of heaven resounded, and the myriad hibernating creatures startled awake.\n\nAmong the assembly was the Great Yang Nine-Dragon August Lord, who in former times had served as the envoy of the Ninefold *Xuan Du*, the Nine Yi, and the Dark Waters. He had also divided his form to become the Perfected of Southern Refinement. Now, having received the Heavenly Worthy’s talismanic command, he became the Nine Heavens’ Investigator.\n\nStepping forth from the ranks, he held his jade tablet aloft and soared upon the clouds. Circling the *Qian* and *Xun* directions, he bowed twice, then knelt before the Heavenly Worthy and recited the incantation:\n\n*\"I am the Lord of the Ninefold Immortal Capital.*\n*I command the Five Directions’ Thunder Deities.*\n*Let the Five Directions’ Thunder Gods hasten to the altar—*\n*Whoever dares arrive late shall first be destroyed in form.*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Investigator then strode upon the *Gang* of the Nine Dragons’ rolling waters, driving clouds and summoning winds, and took his seat.\n\nSuddenly, to the Heavenly Worthy’s right, there appeared the Nine Dipper’s Yang Radiance Flowing Gold Fire Bell Great General, together with the Fire Bell Great Immortal, the Azure Fang Thunderbolt Great Immortal, the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors, the Six *Ding* Jade Maidens, the Six *Jia* Generals, the Nine Heavens’ Howling Mandate Wind and Thunder Envoys, the Nine Heavens’ Azure Dragon Inspecting Soldiers Flying Cloud Officers, the Nine Heavens’ Flowing Gold Scorching Lightning Fire Bell Officers, and the Thunder Command Envoys. Leading their hosts of *qilin*, tigers, leopards, *xiezhi*, and *baize* troops, they arrived at the Vast Court. In an instant, they arrayed themselves before the Nine Heavens’ Investigator, encircling the steps in ranks and bowing beneath the chariots.\n\nThe Investigator addressed them: \"Do you understand? In the time before the beginningless chaos, before the Great Simplicity, there were already the Three Powers and the Three Realms. At that time, I was the Lord of the Five Thunders, and all of you were my subordinates, further subject to the Most High Primordial Lord. That Most High Primordial Lord is now Lord Lao, and the Lord of the Five Thunders is now myself.\"\n\nAll the deities responded in unison: \"We, your servants, have been veiled by yin and thus remain ignorant of our past causes. Now, having heard your supreme words, we shall all obey without fail. Having awakened to the profound purport, we shall exert ourselves in reverence.\"\n\nThe Investigator continued: \"I have heard that thunder is the pivot and mechanism of heaven and earth. The pivot of heaven and the mechanism of earth—yang is thunder, yin is the thunderclap. When the pivot is yin and the mechanism yang, thunder is beneficent and the thunderclap malevolent. For all things, there exists a supreme tally. The supreme tally of yin and the mystery governs life and death. East is three, south is two, north is one, west is four—these are the ancestral numbers of the great reckoning, with five at the center.\"\n\nThe thunderclap attains the central qi of heaven and earth, hence it is called the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Five Thunders, who embodies the Dao of the nine and the five. The east, from *renzi* to *geng*, comprises nine numbers; the north, from *bingzi* to *geng*, comprises five numbers. The remaining *gengzi* returns to *geng* as one, *wuzi* to *geng* as three, and *jiazi* to *geng* as seven. Thus, by attaining the Dao of the nine and the five, it becomes the imperial thunderclap. *Renzi* is the root of the east, *bingzi* the source of the north. *Jia* is thunder, *geng* the thunderclap, and *jia-geng* the command of thunder and thunderclap. *Ren* governs the configuration of thunder, *bing* its convergence, and *zi* its lineage. Within *jia* lies *si*, within *ren* lies *ding*, within *bing* lies *xin*, and within *geng* lies *yi*. Therefore, *jia*, *geng*, *bing*, and *ren* preside over thunder, while *yi*, *xin*, *ding*, and *si* preside over the thunderclap. Only *wu* and *gui* transform into fire, emptying their center, thus becoming the sovereign of thunder and thunderclap.\n\nAs for the Dao of the nine and the five, thunder and thunderclap proceed from north to east, from *zi* to *si*, all yang. By attaining the Dao of the nine and the five in thunder, one commands the awe of heaven and can thereby flourish and wither the myriad things, initiating and extinguishing the four seasons. Now, I, the Lord of the Five Thunders, have attained the Dao of the three and the one in thunder. Three is the ancestral number of the east, and one the generative number of the north. Thus, *zi* of the northern quarter forms the configuration of thunder, while *mao* of the eastern quarter serves as its gate. Attaining the three and the one differs not from the nine and the five—both are the Dao of thunder.\n\nWe, your servants, oversee the thunderclap, wielding the authority of heaven and earth. Fortunate to know the ancient origins, how dare we not expound them fully? Yet we fear to weary your true compassion with our humble words. The Investigator of the Nine Heavens remained silent.\n\nThe Old Lord said: \"You have enlightened me with your sincere hearts—your loyalty is admirable and worthy of reverence. If your words are true, then I possess ancient merit. Now, the Lord of the Five Thunders excels in overseeing the Investigator, which is my deepest aspiration. You should all understand this.\n\nIn the beginning of the kalpa, the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity was the successor of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Floating Radiance. Her eldest son became the Heavenly Venerable of Jade Clarity of Primordial Commencement, while her ninth son held the position of the Supreme Divine King of the Numinous Empyrean of Jade Clarity, the Great Emperor of Longevity, who exclusively governs the Nine Empyreans and the Thirty-Six Heavens. The Thirty-Six Heavenly Venerables are under the command of the Great Emperor, who wields the primordial image and controls yin and yang. Thus, the administration of thunder and thunderclap is entirely subordinate to him. The configuration of thunder lies in the north, its gate in the east, its fire in the south, and its command in the west. *Jia*, *geng*, *bing*, and *ren* constitute the yang thunder, while *yi*, *xin*, *ding*, and *si* constitute the yin thunderclap. *Wu* and *gui* serve as the overseers of thunder fire. Therefore, the Investigator of the Nine Heavens commands the four seasons, controls the five phases, and is indeed the True King.\n\nAll the spirits and gods spoke in unison: \"We, your servants, have been fortunate since our former lives, and only now do we come to understand.\" Upon hearing these words, the Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Commencement returned to the Great Veil, the Lord of the Jade Capital also returned to his true realm, and the Most High Old Lord soon returned to the Grand Clarity. Thereupon, the Investigator of the Nine Heavens also returned to the Palace of Purple Mystery and Radiant Brilliance.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord of the Vast Courtyard of the Empyrean soon addressed the Perfected Lord of Myriad Blessings of the Grand Sovereign, saying: \"We, the myriad heavens of the ten directions and the dragon spirits, each leading our respective domains, shall hasten our chariots to the Nine Empyreans to pay homage to the True King. We shall present the compassionate words of the Heavenly Venerable to report on the True King’s former mandate, thereby comforting the perceptions of the myriad spirits across the Three Realms.\"\n\nHe replied: \"So be it.\" At that time, the Heavenly Lord and the myriad heavens of the ten directions together proceeded to the Nine Empyreans. First, they stood beneath the Jade Clarity Gate of the Nine Empyreans, where the Chamberlain of the Jade Pivot, leading his officials, emerged to stand at the gate. Nine tigers stood in formation, and six dragons lay across the path. The chamberlain came forth to greet them, and only after some time were they permitted to enter. They then passed through the Jade Palace Gate of the Nine Empyreans. Within the gate hung a plaque of luminous jade inscribed with the words: \"Heaven of the Supreme Divine Empyrean.\"\n\nAt its center stood five halls: the Eastern Hall of Azure Radiance, the Southern Hall of Concentrated Spirit, the Western Hall of Jasper Jade, the Northern Hall of Floral Pearl, and the Central Hall of Longevity. There were also the Eastern and Western Flowery Terraces, the Four Offices and Four Bureaus, and beyond them, the Pavilion of the Great Brahma and the Purple Tenuity, and the Hall of the Immortals’ Fire and Thunder. Additionally, there were the Jade Pivot Court, the Five Thunders Court, the Court of the Yang Clan, the Court of the Immortals’ Fire and Thunder, the General Bureau of Thunder, the Bureau of the Great Monad Thunder, the Bureau of the Northern Emperor Thunder, the Penglai General Water Bureau, and countless other offices, courts, and bureaus, each with their own generals and officers.\n\nAbove were the Supreme, Mysterious, and General Ministries of Thunder, the Three Ministries and Six Boards, the Eight Temples and Four Bureaus, and various other offices, pavilions, and halls, each with its own officials. The Eastern and Western Flowery Terraces were all subordinate to them.\n\nAt that time, the myriad heavens of the ten directions all paid their respects before the King. The King dispatched a Jade Youth of Incense Attendance and a Jade Maiden of Chariot Attendance, each one, to express sincerity before the Heavenly Lord. The Heavenly Lord then addressed them, saying: \"The Great Emperor and True King, burdened by the affairs of the Three Realms, regrets not having earlier allowed his chariot wheels to divide his form and scatter his shadow to receive you in separate halls. On the fifth day of the fifth month, he shall open the Southern Palace, the Fiery Bell, the Jade Pupil, and the Flying Radiance Residence, where all are invited to gather.\"\n\nThe heavenly beings lingered, reluctant to depart, and again instructed the Jade Maiden to report to the King, saying: \"The myriad heavens of the ten directions, following the words of the Heavenly Venerable, address the Great Emperor and True King. The heavens possess the Mysterious Scripture, and the scripture contains its wondrous purport. In the beginningless kalpa, it was also expounded and named *The Supreme Jade Clarity of the Nine Empyreans, Great Brahma, Purple Tenuity, Mysterious Capital, Thunder, and Jade Scripture*. Having heard these words, we eagerly desire to hear it at once.\" The Jade Maiden returned and reported this.\n\nAfter the report, the Great Emperor assented. The Great Emperor commanded the Marshal of the Northern Dipper’s Punitive Bureau and the Marshal of the Northern Dipper’s Defensive Bureau, saying: \"The myriad heavens of the ten directions wish for me to expound the scripture. It is my secret treasure, and the Heavenly Venerable has decreed it. You may accompany the Grand Commandant, the Thunder Marshal of the Crimson Standard and Yellow Axe, the Grand Preceptor, the Grand Minister of Thunder, and the officials of the Judgment Bureau, the Prefecture, the Assistant Prefectures, and the Clerks, along with the Vice Ministers, the Directors, the Gentlemen-in-Waiting, the Registrars, and the most capable administrative officials, to attend my jade chariot and ascend the Three Heavens.\"\n\nAfter a while, the two Marshals returned to report: the hundred officials had assembled in the Three Ministries, the Three Ministries had made preparations, and the Supreme Ministry had convened. The Great Emperor ascended the *Primordial Sovereign Cavern-True General Void Great Cloud* palanquin, with the Three Ministries, Five Bureaus, Six Boards, Eight Temples, and the hundred officials following in attendance. White cranes sang, green luan birds chanted, qilin danced upon the clouds, and baize howled in the wind. The Great Emperor’s imperial carriage proceeded, trailed by the carriages of the hundred officials. Fire wheels and fire palaces flanked the procession, the Four Guards on left and right, jade tigers winging ahead, and golden dragons escorting behind, arriving at the gates of the Three Heavens.\n\nFirst, he paid homage to the *Supreme Jade Capital Grand Ultimate Left Palace Immortals* and the *Elder of Heavenly Mechanism* at the *Heavenly Mechanism Ministry*. Next, he paid homage to the *Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces, the Illustrious Great Envoy* at the *Heavenly Pivot Ministry*. Then, he paid homage to the *Three Heavens’ Upholder of the Dao, Auxiliary of the Primordial Great Dharma Master* at the *Grand Mystery Capital Ministry*. Finally, he paid homage to the *Jade Clarity Primordial Beginning Dharma Master, Grand Preceptor of the Jade Hall* at the *Phoenix Pavilion*.\n\nHe then ascended to pay respects to the *Supreme Limitless Great Dao*, the *Supreme Elder*, the *Supreme Dao Lord*, the *Supreme Lord Lao*, the *Heavenly Thearch*, the *Heavenly Thearch Elder*, the *Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital*, the *Nine Qi Elder*, the *Hundreds of Thousands of Layers of Dao Qi’s Twelve Hundred Official Lords*. Having completed his obeisance before the *Great Emperor of the Jade Clarity*, he again bestowed the *Great Elixir Jade Talisman* upon the *Orthodox and Black Paths’ Stewards of the Vast Qi Realm of the Big Dipper’s Wind*. Next, all the thunder departments between Heaven and Earth, along with their related officials, and the assembled spirits and gods, gathered behind the Great Emperor.\n\nThe Great Emperor ascended to audience with the Three Clarities. The Jade Maidens of the Three Clarities scattered jade blossoms, which drifted upon the Big Dipper’s wind. Divine mist and jade clouds wafted through the distant purple capital. The Great Emperor, holding his ritual tablet and clad in solemn robes, stood to the right of the dais.\n\nThe *Great Brahma Radiant Dawn Attendant* proclaimed: \"The Most Venerable Supreme Heavenly Thearch, the Limitless and Supreme Emperor, takes his throne—this is the *Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable*.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"Since you have come, my brother, I have thirty-six thousand officials, and my palace has thirty-six thousand chief palace maidens, who oversee the affairs of thirty-six thousand worlds—yet I still find it beneath me. You are my brother; why trouble yourself so?\"\n\nThe Great Emperor rose in reverence and reported: \"I speak of the *Supreme Nine Empyrean Jade Clarity Great Brahma Purple Tenuity Mysterious Capital Thunder Jade Scripture*—a treasure transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, hidden since the division of primordial chaos. This treasure ought to be revealed; I dare not keep it secret nor claim its teachings as my own.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"Very well.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor took his leave. The Heavenly Venerable commanded the *Great Luo Limitless Divine Duke* and the *Three Heavens’ Grand Chancellor* to meet at the *Jade Brahma Radiant August* palace, where they convened with the *Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven* and the *August Earth Deity*. The Great Emperor sat beneath the Heavenly Thearch, the Earth Deity sat beneath the Great Emperor, the Divine Duke sat facing the Great Emperor, and the Grand Chancellor sat beneath the Divine Duke.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable bestowed jade nectar, followed by the *Great Tenuity Golden Liquid*. For the feast, eight qilin were served as jerky, nine phoenixes as preserved meat, three dragons as roasts, and four tigers as minced delicacies. After a long while, the drinking concluded, and the Divine Duke and Grand Chancellor took their leave together.\n\nThe Great Emperor again paid homage to the *Jade Clarity Great Emperor*, commanding the *Four Bureaus of the Longevity Palace* and the *Left and Right Recorders* to transcribe the scripture that very day. He then presented his thanks to the Three Heavens, with the Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August joining in the offering.\n\nThe Great Emperor returned to sit in the *Longevity Palace*. The Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August sat together in the jade carriage, while the ten directions’ myriad heavens all had their own jade palanquins. The dragon spirits of the various heavens stood along the steps of the dais.\n\nThe Great Emperor sat in silence for a long while, then intoned the incantation: \"*Thunder One, Thunder Two, Thunder Three, Thunder Four, Thunder Five—Om Hum Hum, Tri-dhāna, Auḥ Hī Vi Gaṃ Bili Caṭa.* Hasten, hasten! Summon you by name, known throughout the world—come swiftly, come swiftly!\"\n\n\"Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands! *Om Hum Hum, Han-nan-yan Qian-yi She.*\n\nThe Great Emperor then addressed the Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August, saying: 'These ten directions’ myriad heavens now wish to hear the exposition of the true essence.'\n\nThe Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August replied to the Great Emperor: 'The ten directions’ myriad heavens have long awaited this grace. Your Majesty’s compassion is boundless—how could it be withheld?'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'I have just completed the incantation. Let us wait a moment.'\n\nAfter a short while, the Five Marshals led their hosts—dragon soldiers and tiger cavalry—summoning wind and howling rain, flying thunder and flashing lightning, scattering clouds and pealing thunderclaps. The uproar shook the heavens, and lightning flickered in dazzling bursts. The Great Emperor commanded the Five Thunder Envoys to strike the Five Thunder Command Tablet once. At once, heaven and earth fell silent, and the Great Emperor began his discourse.\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'I am the son of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance and the Divine Mother of Jade Purity, the younger brother of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity, and the uncle of the Most High Lord Lao. My wives are the sun and moon, my kin the stars, my servants wind and thunder, my chariots clouds and mist. I emerge from nonbeing into being, conceal the sacred and manifest the mundane, ride the void and harness the dawn, traverse the empty and tread the celestial. The Three Officials soar in my wake, and the Five Emperors follow in my radiance. How could I, though exalted, fail to act? Thus, I devote my heart to the Three Realms and exert my strength in the Five Phases. Of this, all you heavenly dragons and spirits—who does not know?'\n\nAt that moment, the Thunder Gods and Fire Masters, bearing their tablets and scepters, stood before the Great Emperor. Bowing deeply and kneeling, they said: 'Alas! In this forsaken world, all sentient beings—rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, husbands and wives, elder and younger brothers, hosts and guests, friends and relatives, servants and slaves, creatures of feather, fur, scale, and shell, those that fly, walk, move, or grow, from root to sprout, from sentient to insentient—from kalpas past to the present, since the dawn of existence, have endured eons of toil and dust. The stains of this life’s deeds cling to them. Greed, wrath, delusion, and desire sprout in the conduct of their lives. Killing, stealing, and licentiousness take shape in the rise of thought and the stir of intent. Three poisons of the heart, four evils of the tongue—one’s faults multiply a hundredfold, one’s own a thousandfold. This leaky, illusory body bears boundless transgressions. The sea of right and wrong is vast, the mountain of self and other looms high. How can they escape the decree of thunder?'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'Before heaven and earth existed, I already was. Before I existed, the root already was. The root of life and the origin of death are the gates of heaven’s palace and earth’s law. The cycle of birth and death turns like ants on a millstone. If one were to claim birth and death do not exist, then heaven and earth would have no day or night, and day and night would have no sun or moon. Thus, birth and death cannot be absent. And within them dwell fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, glory and decay, favor and disgrace, right and wrong, self and other, fame and profit, wealth and rank—all are bound to the cycle of birth and death, to which life and destiny are tied. Therefore, in the northeast lies the Wind-Thunder Hell, which is but the wrath of the thunder decree. For minor transgressions, the Great One reviews the records. For greater sins, the Three Corpses report above. For the gravest offenses, the Three Officials wield their brushes, and the wind-knives arrive at once. For the most heinous crimes, the matter falls to the thunder’s jurisdiction. In the yang realm, there is the punishment of flogging corpses; in the yin realm, the law of dismemberment. Whispers in the human world are heard in heaven like thunder; deceit in the dark is seen by the gods like lightning. Can one not be cautious?\n\nOf scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants, of monks, nuns, Daoists, and laity—from the Son of Heaven to the common folk—when fate is struck by comets or the body plagued by demonic disturbances, it is the governance of my thunder that truly descends upon them.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'Thunder governs heaven’s weal and woe, holds the scales of all things. It oversees beings and people, controls life and death, inspects and restrains, opens and closes, guards the keys of creation. From the Heavenly Sovereign above to the Earthly Thearch below, none can issue their decrees without thunder. From life and death in the great to glory and decay in the small, none can administer their governance without thunder. The decrees of thunder have their subordinates. Those who serve the decrees of thunder each have their lords. Today, I will explain them to you one by one. All must revere and obey them with awe.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'The Three Pure Ones and the Most Sacred are the ancestors of thunder. The Ten Ultimate Honored Ones are the root of thunder. The Jade Emperor of the August Heaven issues the commands of thunder. The August Earthly Thearch of the Rear Land regulates thunder.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'I am the Highest Divine Radiant Jade Purity True King, the Longevity Great Emperor of the Divine Empyrean. Next in rank are the Eastern Ultimate Azure Flower Great Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation through the Thunder’s Resonance of the Nine Heavens, the Great Emperor Ancestor of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Great Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity Azure Jade Palace of the Highest Purity, the Great Emperor of the Six Heavens’ Abyssal Cavern, the Lord Emperor of the Six Waves’ Heaven, the True Lord Controller of the Han, the True Lord Investigator of the Nine Heavens—these are the Nine Celestial Lords of the Divine Empyrean.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'Do you, the assembled hosts of the ten directions’ myriad heavens, understand? Thus, when the lower world seeks to avert water or fire, sever baleful stars or fell demonic shrines, cut off dragons or repel tigers, dispel pestilence or ward off evil, resolve the celestial net above or the earthly calamities below—when there are yearly disasters, monthly misfortunes, life-threatening stars, karmic adversities from three lifetimes, seven generations of inauspicious encounters, curses from ghosts and spirits, or demonic afflictions—whether fatal or survivable, resolved or unresolved—all must be reported to the Nine Celestial Lords, then submitted to the various bureaus.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'The True Lord Judges of the Jade Palace, the Left and Right Chamberlains of the Jade Palace, the Left and Right Chief Ministers, the Heavenly Thunder Prime Ministers, the Jade Pivot Envoys, the Dipper Pivot Prime Ministers, the Highest Purity Life Controllers, the Right Ministers of the Jade Palace, the Envoys of the Five Thunder Courts, the Thunder Commanders-in-Chief, the True Lords of Original Destiny—these are the pivotal offices of thunder, hence called the Nine Bureaus. All must be reported to them. Additionally, the Five Directional Thunder Kings and the Great Emperor Lords of the Five Directional Thunders must also be reported to.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'The Sun Palace’s Great Yang Emperor Lord relies on thunder for his might.'\"\n\nThe Moon Palace’s Great Yin August Lord relies on thunder for his numinous power. The Nine August Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper rely on thunder for their pivotal governance.\n\nIn former times, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy commanded the Supreme Clarity’s Most High Primordial Lord, ordering the Grand Immortal Scribe of the Nine Provinces, the Luminous Great Envoy, to adjudicate matters of the Thunder Bureau’s Grand Ministry. The Supreme Jade Capital’s Great Ultimate Left Palace Immortal Elder adjudicated matters of the Thunder Bureau’s Mysterious Ministry. The Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Master Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial adjudicated matters of the Thunder Bureau’s General Ministry. Furthermore, the Great Immortal Fuqiu was convened to oversee the affairs of the Three Ministries of Thunder. The remaining offices and bureaus were all assigned to their respective jurisdictions.\n\nSome were called concurrent offices, others branch offices. Where they were dispatched to govern, if they were to inspect and supervise the official bureaus, they were called traveling offices. When the four offices had vacancies, all were to be filled by selection. In former kalpas, they had already been selected and promoted. These four offices were once again to descend into the world, overseeing households and transforming the people. Upon the completion of their merit, they would return to their respective jurisdictions.\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"All you heavens of the ten directions, you should know that this scripture is profoundly wondrous and not to be disseminated to inferior scholars. In the past, I received the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, commanding me to issue talismans and writs from the Nine Empyreans’ Jade Clarity Palace, proclaiming and transmitting mandates, conferring registers and charters, delivering the living and the dead—those born into bodies receiving deliverance, the souls of the dead undergoing refinement, escaping the hells, ascending to perfection, and transcending fate. All these are the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic mandates, to be obeyed and enacted by the Nine Empyreans. Within this Heaven of the Nine Empyreans’ Jade Clarity, I oversee the Vermilion Numinous Fire Palace, the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity’s Refinement Bureau, the Lower Palace of Southern Prosperity’s Deliverance Bureau, the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, and the Grand Clarity’s Yellow Register Universal Radiance Office.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning issued a mandate appointing three officials to administer talismanic commands, subordinate to my original heaven. He commanded the Great Luo’s Boundless Divine Duke to adjudicate matters of the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, styled as the Perfected Yu Luo Qiao—this was the first. He further commanded the Jade Clarity’s Primordial Beginning Dharma Master to serve as the Envoy of the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, styled as the Perfected True Radiance—this was the second. Next, he commanded the Grand Master of the Jade Hall’s Great Teachings to serve as the Deputy Envoy of the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, styled as the Perfected Radiant Wondrous Sound—this was the third. With these three assistants, I oversee the affairs of this heaven’s deliverance of the living and the dead. All matters of refinement and deliverance must first be reported to the Nine August Ones, then submitted to the Nine Bureaus. Only afterward may the Three Assistants be informed, the Three Ministries be petitioned, and the offices of the Sun and Moon Palaces and the Northern Dipper’s bureaus be notified. Thus, one may pass through the barriers of all heavens, command the earthly deities, and universally proclaim to the Three Realms. If this is not done, even a thousand talismans and a hundred writs will be as nothing before the vastness of heaven and earth.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"If the emperors and sovereigns of the human world, in their efforts to safeguard the nation’s mandate, pacify the common people, harmonize the four seasons, regulate the two qi, are able to have this scripture’s principles woven into brocade, adorned with golden caskets, encased in stone chests, and enshrined within the seas and mountains, then the people will dwell in peace, winds and rains will come in due season, the hundred grains will flourish, all things will thrive, the nation will know no warfare, and the customs will be marked by wealth and longevity. Wherever this scripture resides, there will be Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, Heavenly Ding and Valiant Warriors, Wolf Clerks and Tiger Guards, Heavenly Armored Soldiers, Inspectors of Deceit and Hook Cavalry, Chief Ministers of the Capital Bureaus, Post Station and Relay Officials, Station Magistrates and Gale Wind Officers, Relay and Courier Clerks, Mounted Memorial Clerks, Flying Talisman and Demolished Shrine Clerks, Yin Spirit Judgment Clerks, Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, and Flying Dragon Courier Clerks—all will follow to protect and uphold it.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor further addressed the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions: \"In the past, in the Azure Vault of Floating Radiance Heaven, I, along with the Boundless Great Sages of the Ten Directions, attended the Primordial Beginning amidst the Jeweled Millet of Empty Song. The Primordial Beginning expounded the *Great Numinous Chapter of Primordial Azure*. At that time, I made a great vow, saying: ‘After five hundred kalpas, when the fate of the world is adverse and the people suffer calamities, their corpses will pile as high as mountains, their blood will flow across the wilderness, and there will be no return to the present age of myriad phenomena’s great peace, where yin and yang are free from harm. Thunder executes the central qi of heaven and earth, governs the central administration of heaven and earth, investigates and adjudicates fortune and misfortune, assists in governing the celestial pivot, commands yin and yang, and oversees the earth’s records. As the lord of thunder, I should take the lead, even to the point of replacing them, so that all sentient beings may be freed from demonic afflictions. Yet my merit and effort in this cannot compare to the Primordial Beginning’s expounding of this numinous chapter, which is so profoundly wondrous that people may awaken through it. Now, this scripture of mine is no different in its purport. It is also through this scripture that my profound assembly is revealed. All sentient beings who hear this scripture, when their jade towers’ qi is severed and their silver seas’ flowers wither, will immediately attain deliverance and not pass through hell.’\"\n\nAt that time, the heavens of the ten directions simultaneously bowed their heads and proclaimed it good. The Heavenly Emperor and Earthly Sovereign also said, \"Excellent!\" The devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits rejoiced greatly. Golden Lads danced with incense, and Jade Maidens scattered flowers.\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"When people’s thoughts arise and their actions move, if they act unvirtuously—offending heaven and earth, defiling the sun and moon, reviling winds and rains, exposing themselves to the stars, turning their backs on rulers and teachers, insulting parents, deceiving friends, arrogantly scorning neighbors, killing and harming living beings, wasting grain, using false weights and measures, deceiving sages, enforcing cruel laws, mutilating bodies, injuring and slaughtering birds and beasts, engaging in secret lewdness and theft, teaching poison and aiding villains, coveting honors, and resenting the weak—then heaven will be angered, earth will be enraged, ghosts will resent them, and spirits will detest them. If they can command the officials of the Nine Empyreans’ various bureaus and the First-Rank Immortal Officials of the Upper Primordial, or Orthodox Unity Daoists, to establish altars and make vows in monastery retreats or within their homes, and invite the recitation of this Jade Scripture—whether for one day, three days, five days, or seven days—they should first report to the upper spirits, confess their transgressions, and pray for the protection of their original destiny’s hun souls, beseeching their concealment in the Jade Palace and their submission to the Heavenly Ding for action. For this reason, the Three Officials will cease their indictments, the Black Registers will halt their pursuits, they will be spared from thunder’s wrath, and will not incur heavenly punishment. Turning their hearts toward goodness, they will attain good fortune.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: Should there be those afflicted by celestial demons or earthly specters, mountain spirits or stone monsters, the malevolent forces of the Five Phases or the fiendish perils of the Three Realms, or harmed by the vengeful dead in village shrines—where vengeful corpses press their grievances, startled souls scatter in chaos, the five viscera fall into disharmony, and the living and the dead contend in the heart, leaving no semblance of normalcy—I shall dispatch the Vanguard General of the Demon-Subduing Host, along with the Nine Heavens’ Cloud-Road Ghost-Seizing Faceless Great Deity, the Golden Blade Merit Officer, and lead the Heavenly Ding to distinguish between man and ghost, executing those who resist by severing their corpses.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: For the rites of averting water disasters, one must petition the Water Palace’s Fusang Grand Lord, the Water Palace’s Feng Yi Lord, the Wave Deity Xuanming Lord, and issue writs to the Five Lakes’ Great Deities, the Four Seas’ Dragon Kings, the Nine Rivers’ Water Emperors, the Four Riverheads’ Source Lords, the Nine Streams’ Overseers, the Kunlun River Source Lord, the River Chief Great Deity, and the Penglai Capital Water Commissioner. Command them to swiftly expel water monsters, block raging waves, annihilate malevolent remnants, and prevent harm to the people.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: For the rites of expiating fire, one must petition the Southern Fire Star Lord, the Fire Deity Zhu Rong Lord, the Thunder-Fire Gatekeeper Lord, the Fire Department’s Huilu Lord, the Fire Bell General, and issue writs to the Southern Fire Department’s Fire-Controlling Great Deities, the Five Directions’ Flying Fire, Hurling Fire, and Flowing Fire Great Deities, the Golden Scripture Fire-Administering Great Immortals, the Fire Department Judges, the Bing-Ding Lads, the Fire-Conquering Generals, and the Radiant Light Great Deities. Command them to purge fire calamities, purify the people’s lands, and prevent scorching flames from spreading their poison.\n\nWhen the myriad clans perform rites to avert water or expiate fire, they must also issue writs to the Grand Year’s [Year Name] Lord, as water belongs to the Lunar Palace and fire to the Solar Palace.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: When baleful stars appear over a kingdom or malevolent luminaries shine upon a person, this is due to the Primordial Beginning’s method of shifting stars and altering constellations. As for ominous stars and rebellious constellations that do not belong to the Five August Ones, the Eleven Luminaries, the Twenty-Eight Mansions, or the stars within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, all may be slain. First, memorialize the Nine Celestial Offices, then petition the Nine Bureaus, and next memorialize the Northern Culmen’s Purple Tenuity Great Emperor and petition the Northern Dipper’s Seven Kings’ Palace, allowing them to naturally sever and cast them down.\n\nThe destruction of shrines follows a different procedure. For any shrine deity that is unrighteous, one must first issue a writ to the local City God, then submit a memorial. On any *bing* day, one may submit a petition, and there will be an investigation; the authorities will carry it out without fail.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: Should there be those gravely ill beyond cure, their four limbs bereft of protection, one must memorialize and request the Heavenly Physician Envoys, the Divine Medicine Officers, the Healing Envoys, and the Golden Moxibustion Lads to come and provide treatment. Upon petition, Jade *qi* will flow and transform, divine elixirs will descend to revive the august people, restoring their spiritual countenance. If afflicted by malevolent forces, proceed likewise.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: Subduing flood dragons follows the same method as averting water. To repel tigers, summon the local Earth Deities, the Divine Tiger Jade Maidens, and the Jade Maidens who command tigers. For the method of halting epidemics, issue writs to the Five Pestilence Envoys and the Grand Year’s Venerable Deity, and all must submit documents to the Thunder Bureau.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: Should ghosts and spirits masquerade as ancestral spirits, demanding sacrifices and transforming into a hundred monstrosities to coerce offerings—hurling bricks and tiles, pounding on doors and gates, scattering sand and setting fires, startling chickens and teasing dogs, hanging snakes and suspending rats, casting shadows and transmitting voices—all who harm people daily shall be judged by their crimes.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: In the Nine Heavens’ Jade Purity Prefecture reside the Eastern Numinous Grand Minister, the Auspicious Light Immortal Master, the Six Flowers’ Jade Thunder Envoy, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Snow-Commanding General, and the Wind-Returning Cloud-Weaving Envoy, who oversee matters of snow and hail, subordinate to the Lunar Palace’s Grand Yin Sovereign.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: When a land suffers from severe drought, its people parched and scorched, fish and birds distressed, grasses and trees withered and brittle, malevolent spirits wreaking havoc, flames scorching the sky, a canopy of fire spreading in all four directions, and a thousand *li* of reddened earth, one must petition the Eastern Well and Winnowing Basket Star Envoys, the Heavenly Gate’s Eastern Wall Envoy, the Metal Gate and Net Star Envoys, the Three Mountains’ Great Unity Wood Lad Great Deity, and the Four Seas’ Four Ding Great Deities, commanding them to drive dragons to gather water, summon clouds, and bring forth rain.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: For prolonged, excessive rains, one should report to the local City Gods, Earth Gods, and Village Boundary Officers, stating that embankments have collapsed and ditches overflowed. Memorialize the Grand Sun’s Nine Dragon Sovereign, beseeching the dispatch of the Nine Dippers’ Yang Essence Flowing Metal Fire Bell Great General to seal the depths, lock the seas, halt the rain, restrain the dragons, roll back the mists, gather the clouds, and unveil the heavens to shine the sun.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: You, the Thunder Deities and Fire Masters, know my manifold expedient means, which I have deigned to teach. Now that this scripture has been expounded—a text rarely encountered—should anyone obtain it yet fail to keep it secret, treating it with carelessness and disdain, know that such a person will disrupt the Three Primordials and incur transgressions recorded in the Eight Registers. Those who uphold it may manifest numinous power, for it is governed by the Five Directions’ Thunder Deities and Officers, whom I shall now explain one by one.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Fire Masters replied: We understand. We request to proclaim it.\n\nBefore the Great Emperor, the Thunder Deities and Fire Masters prostrated themselves, knelt reverently, and addressed him: We have heard that the Five Directions’ Thunder Deities and Officers have long received the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s prophecy, assisting and aiding the True King in governing the administration of thunder. Wishing to instruct the world, yet without your decree, we have kept it secret. We now declare:\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Eastern Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Hu Feng Ya, Duo Zhe Li, and Yi Jiu Luo.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Southern Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Bing Jiu Lu, Nuan Yan Liao, and Shi A Xiong.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Western Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Rong Yao Ling, Lang Zhong Yan, and Shan Jiu Tuo.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Northern Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Lu Xing Meng, Heng Tian Ba, and Zhao Zhen Jiu.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Central Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Sun Zhen Er, Duo Bo Yan, and Xu Zhi Gui.\n\nWe declare these divine officers: their majestic power and blazing qi illuminate the winds and clouds, their vast spiritual efficacy eclipses the sun and moon. They can shake the seas and mountains, and set the cosmos itself in motion—such are the envoys of the Heavenly Emperor, the most potent of the Thunder Department. Whenever this scripture is recited, these divine officers, leading their respective legions, shall hear their names called and descend upon the altar.\n\nThe Emperor proclaimed:\nThus, the Azure Yang Spirit of the East, the Azure Emperor and Azure Dragon, radiates sacred light and mighty power, shaking the earth with fierce thunderclaps—Great General Qu Heng.\n\nThe Fire Chariot and Fire Torch of the South, the True Yang’s thunder and lightning, roar with devouring might—Great General Kong Guang.\n\nThe White Lightning Lord of the West, flashing with dazzling bolts, the Thunder Duke and

oaths, cut down evil and establish rectitude, extinguish wickedness and exalt purity, strike down demonic shrines and execute malevolence, sever pestilence and repel poison, heal the people’s illnesses, and bring good fortune and well-being to all.\"\n\nIn former times, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy employed these divine officers, and at that time there was an incantation that said:\n*\"Green waters, clear waves, deep and limpid,\nA thousand-jun axe’s edge, light as a hair on the back of the head,\nBy the riverside willow tree, blown down by the wind,\nEven if it struck Chang’e, she would not be startled.\"*\n\n*\"Light as dust in the void when light,\nHeavy as a thousand-weight iron when heavy,\nWhite as snow in the heavens when white,\nRed as the blood of the red ape when red.\"*\n\n*\"Weaver Girl, Fourth Brother, Gou Lou, auspicious and fortunate,\nAscending monks attain their color.\"*\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in statutes and ordinances!*\n\nWhen the Thunder Gods, Fire Masters, and all the heavenly beings heard this incantation, the heavens darkened and the earth blackened, winds stirred and thunder flew, thunder and hail clamored, mist and rain rushed and split, mountains and rivers shook and resounded, the cosmos grew dim.\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"Fire Master, Fire Master, so numinous, so divine—neither from me, nor from you, neither from gods nor from ghosts. With a single thought’s arrival, how could it not be natural?\"\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"The Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Great Emperor governs the Three Realms and commands the Five Thunders.\n\nThe Heavenly Honored Lords of the Heavenly Stem, Heavenly Strategist, and Winged Sage, along with the Dark Warrior Lord, each oversee their respective domains.\n\nThe Heavenly Gua Spirit and River Stalwart Spirit serve as the bureau for summoning thunder and commanding lightning.\n\nThe Nine Heavens Flowing Metal Fire Bell Great General, Heavenly Ding Warriors, Six Ding Jade Maidens, Six Jia Generals—these are the envoys who regulate thunder and lightning.\n\nThe Nine Heavens Howling Mandate Wind-Thunder Envoys, Thunder Ordinance Envoys, Fire Ordinance Great Immortals, Fire Earls, Wind Ordinances, Fire Earls, Wind Earls, Four-Eyed Hoary Elder, Azure Fang Thunderbolt Great Immortals—these are the gods who govern and restrain thunder and lightning.\n\nThe Fire Earl Wind-Thunder Lord, Wind-Fire Primordial Bright Lord, Lightning Light Primordial Sage Lord, Rain Master Venerable Immortal Lord—these are the lords of thunder, wind, and rain.\n\nAmong them are the Three-Five Shaoyang Thunder Dukes and the Fire Chariot Iron-Faced Gods.\n\nAmong them are the Wind-Bearing Fierce Officers, Silver-Fanged Gleaming-Eyed Fire Ordinance Great Gods, Wolf-Fanged Fierce Officers, Great Judges, Five Thunder Flying Swift Envoys, Five Directions Thunder Duke Generals, Eight Directions Cloud-Thunder Great Generals, Five Directions Barbarian Thunder Envoys, Three Realms Barbarian Thunder Envoys, and Nine Communities Barbarian Thunder Envoys—truly they execute their commands and assist in their authority.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor declared: \"The August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven governs the heavens without action, the origin of all transformations. The Earthly Empress and August Earth Spirit receive the Mandate of Heaven and preside over yin and yang. All people who stand with heads touching the heavens and feet treading the earth, having obtained this divine scripture, ought to be deeply grateful.\"\n\nEvery morning at dawn, stand facing the southeast and pray: *\"I, a being of impure mortal flesh, a walking skeleton and moving corpse, have endured kalpas until now, my sins as vast as mountains and seas. I humbly beseech the Supreme Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Perfect Trinity, the Merciful Father and Holy Mother, the Venerable Lords of the Ten Directions, the Nine Empyrean Thunder and Lightning Imperial Perfected, the Golden Empress and Jade Consorts, the Ministerial Masters and Envoys, the Dharma Realm’s True Spirits—to universally extend their compassion, graciously grant forgiveness, and bestow upon me the Supreme Ten Directions’ Five Thunder Golden Light Fire Clouds and the Orthodox Unity True Qi, flowing into my three burners, nine palaces, five viscera, and six bowels, so that my name may be registered in the Great Empyrean, my body ascend to the Jade Treasury, I may depart the world and return to my original nature, and roam the Great Void.\"*\n\nAs the Great Emperor concluded the scripture’s discourse, the Heavenly Emperor and Earthly Sovereign first returned to their jade palaces, the Lords of the Ten Directions each departed, immortals flew away, thunder gods and fire masters hastened to take their leave, and the lords of thunder and lightning all attended the True King.\n\nThe great earth soared with clouds, the empty void drizzled with mist, clouds celebrated in five colors, dew scattered in eight sweetnesses. Sweet dew and auspicious clouds suffused the cosmos, filling the land with harmony and joy, and all the world with great peace.\n\nThe Great Emperor led the immortals on an inspection tour of the Luminous Court. The Great Emperor again addressed the thunder and lightning functionaries, the attendants of the imperial abode, the immortal ministers, immortal gentlemen, and jade gentlemen, saying: \"I possess the Nine Empyrean Jade Clarity Great Brahma Purple Tenuity Immortal Capital’s Nine Talismans, which shall now be transmitted and proclaimed. All of you, listen carefully.\"\n\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Wind-Summoning Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Thunder-Conjuring Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Cloud-Raising Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Rain-Bringing Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Lightning-Stirring Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Snow-Praying Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Tide-Borrowing Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Demon-Quelling Jade Talisman\nThe Jade Clarity Great Brahma Clear-Sky-Invoking Jade Talisman\n\nThereupon, the True King, the Great Emperor, bestowed the Nine Talismans, pledging them to the lords of thunder and lightning, saying: \"These jade scriptures are all concealed within the Hidden Writ of the Central August Jade of Heaven, and as such, they must be kept secret. Even as precious talismans, you must still receive them with reverence. Your awe-inspiring might, upon hearing these talismanic commands, must act with utmost urgency.\"\n\nThe lords of thunder and lightning arrayed themselves before the King, bowing and declaring: \"How dare we not exert ourselves with diligence, respectfully obeying the sagely instructions?\"\n\nThe Great Emperor then summoned the Marshal of the Northern Dipper’s Punitive Office, the Marshal of the Northern Dipper’s Defensive Office, and the Black-Clad Ensign Bearer of the Northern Dipper’s Mobile Court. Receiving the jade chariot, they returned to the Nine Empyreans, making a deep bow to the Luminous Court before ascending the jeweled carriage. Five-colored clouds flanked the imperial carriage, ninefold mists guarded the axle, eight phoenixes sang ahead, and ten thousand cranes danced behind. Jade blossoms lined the path, trailing dew drifted in mist, and the assembled perfected of thunder followed in procession.\n\nThe Great Emperor again took his seat in the Hall of Medicinal Pearls. The celestial beings of the ten directions and the lords of thunder and lightning prostrated themselves in rows, offering dew-written memorials in gratitude. The Thunder Gods and Fire Masters reverently approached the imperial presence, bowing their heads to present a profound hymn, saying:\n\n\"The Great Emperor descends to the Luminous Court,\nHis body borne on a chariot of jade mist.\nCelestial beings gather in fivefold clouds,\nListening to the recitation of the Purple Immortal’s scripture.\nPrecious words resound in jeweled Brahma tones,\nThe golden pivot transmits the jade talismans.\nReturning to the Hall of Cinnabar Petals,\nPhoenixes and cranes soar through the immortal capital.\"\n\nAt that time, the Chief Immortal Steward of the Hall of Cinnabar Petals led the assembled perfected in withdrawing from the imperial presence. All addressed one another, saying: \"We truly receive and vow to carry them out.\"\n\nThus concludes *The Supreme Nine Empyrean Jade Clarity Great Brahma Purple Tenuity Mysterious Capital Thunder and Lightning Jade Scripture*.",

The Most High Lord Lao spoke with his heart’s voice: \"Since the beginningless kalpas of old, what roots of goodness did I plant, what fruits of cultivation did I perfect, that I might transcend the Three Realms, ascend to the Jade Purity Heaven, and become the Teacher of Humans and Devas? Revered by the Three Realms, I assist above in the transformation of the Great Veil’s Primordial Beginning and below in the flourishing of the Shangqing and Lingbao traditions. Through countless kalpas, I have encountered such fortune—yet my form remains unexpressed in words.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Do not harbor such doubts. The Great Dao Lord of the Jade Imperial Court shall elucidate for you—attend closely.\"\n\nThe Great Dao Lord of the Jade Imperial Court, having received the Heavenly Worthy’s command, first bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, then saluted the Heavenly Sovereign.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy sat upon a chariot of nine jades, soaring rosy clouds, and the luminous radiance of the Azure Void. The Heavenly Sovereign attended beside him, seated upon a palanquin of eightfold numinous rosy dawns. The Dao Lord stood to the Heavenly Worthy’s right, seated upon a chariot of jade clouds, feathered empyreans, brocade mists, and the great azure.\n\nThe myriad heavens of the ten directions each bore palanquins of verdant forests and feathered voids, floating canopies, and great cinnabar flying immortals with five-colored clouds and scattered luminosities. Among them were chariots of empyrean numina and flowing jade glows, great immortals with eyes like jade orbs; chariots of purple auroras, solar brilliance, and feathered wings; banners of nine-jointed dancing immortals; standards of embryonic spirits and the eightfold purity; pennants of ninefold rosy clouds; and flags of threefold clouds. Eight phoenixes sang in the void, nine *luan* birds chanted Brahmanic hymns. Immortal attendants of the left bore clouds, those of the right bore rosy mists. The vast music of the Celestial Spheres arrayed to left and right, with feathered robes and rainbow skirts performed in succession. When the celestial music concluded, the tenfold radiance shone clearly, and the four seasons’ airs settled into clarity.\n\nThe Dao Lord then ascended his chariot of jade blossoms and ninefold immortals’ pristine origin. Raising his jade tablet, he saluted the immortals, his gaze sweeping across the myriad heavens. Serene and at ease, he sighed softly, then turned to Lord Lao and said: \"You abide in the wondrous expanse of the Great Clarity’s realm, dwelling in the court of the Great Possession. Humans and devas gaze upon you, dragons and spirits revere you. The Five Thearchs prostrate in homage, and the myriad immortals attend in welcome. Yet you do not take pride in your glory but instead humble yourself, diligently reflecting upon the profound. Why should you deign to hear my words? I shall expound for you—you ought to awaken.\"\n\nLord Lao descended from his chariot and bowed before the Jade Imperial Lord, saying: \"I regard the Primordial Beginning as my father and you, my elder brother. Thus, I understand without words, know without translation. Yet I remain humble and diligent, troubling you to examine my heart. I beg your celestial majesty’s indulgence—let me unfold my own account.\"\n\nLord Lao returned to his seat, raised his scepter of golden light and sixfold luminous rosy mists, faced the Heavenly Worthy, then turned to the Dao Lord, and manifested his mighty power.\n\nAt that moment, heaven and earth trembled. Black clouds spread thickly, divine winds roared through the sky, mountains flew and peaks raced. Ten thousand dragons leapt, lightning and fire intertwined. Cloud masters cried out ahead, rain riders howled behind. The great winter drums of heaven resounded, and the myriad hibernating creatures startled awake.\n\nAmong the assembly was the Great Yang Nine-Dragon August Lord, who in former times had served as the envoy of the Ninefold *Xuan Du*, the Nine Yi, and the Dark Waters. He had also divided his form to become the Perfected of Southern Refinement. Now, having received the Heavenly Worthy’s talismanic command, he became the Nine Heavens’ Investigator.\n\nStepping forth from the ranks, he held his jade tablet aloft and soared upon the clouds. Circling the *Qian* and *Xun* directions, he bowed twice, then knelt before the Heavenly Worthy and recited the incantation:\n\n*\"I am the Lord of the Ninefold Immortal Capital.*\n*I command the Five Directions’ Thunder Deities.*\n*Let the Five Directions’ Thunder Gods hasten to the altar—*\n*Whoever dares arrive late shall first be destroyed in form.*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ Investigator then strode upon the *Gang* of the Nine Dragons’ rolling waters, driving clouds and summoning winds, and took his seat.\n\nSuddenly, to the Heavenly Worthy’s right, there appeared the Nine Dipper’s Yang Radiance Flowing Gold Fire Bell Great General, together with the Fire Bell Great Immortal, the Azure Fang Thunderbolt Great Immortal, the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors, the Six *Ding* Jade Maidens, the Six *Jia* Generals, the Nine Heavens’ Howling Mandate Wind and Thunder Envoys, the Nine Heavens’ Azure Dragon Inspecting Soldiers Flying Cloud Officers, the Nine Heavens’ Flowing Gold Scorching Lightning Fire Bell Officers, and the Thunder Command Envoys. Leading their hosts of *qilin*, tigers, leopards, *xiezhi*, and *baize* troops, they arrived at the Vast Court. In an instant, they arrayed themselves before the Nine Heavens’ Investigator, encircling the steps in ranks and bowing beneath the chariots.\n\nThe Investigator addressed them: \"Do you understand? In the time before the beginningless chaos, before the Great Simplicity, there were already the Three Powers and the Three Realms. At that time, I was the Lord of the Five Thunders, and all of you were my subordinates, further subject to the Most High Primordial Lord. That Most High Primordial Lord is now Lord Lao, and the Lord of the Five Thunders is now myself.\"\n\nAll the deities responded in unison: \"We, your servants, have been veiled by yin and thus remain ignorant of our past causes. Now, having heard your supreme words, we shall all obey without fail. Having awakened to the profound purport, we shall exert ourselves in reverence.\"\n\nThe Investigator continued: \"I have heard that thunder is the pivot and mechanism of heaven and earth. The pivot of heaven and the mechanism of earth—yang is thunder, yin is the thunderclap. When the pivot is yin and the mechanism yang, thunder is beneficent and the thunderclap malevolent. For all things, there exists a supreme tally. The supreme tally of yin and the mystery governs life and death. East is three, south is two, north is one, west is four—these are the ancestral numbers of the great reckoning, with five at the center.\"",

      "translated_text": "The thunderclap attains the central qi of heaven and earth, hence it is called the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Five Thunders, who embodies the Dao of the nine and the five. The east, from *renzi* to *geng*, comprises nine numbers; the north, from *bingzi* to *geng*, comprises five numbers. The remaining *gengzi* returns to *geng* as one, *wuzi* to *geng* as three, and *jiazi* to *geng* as seven. Thus, by attaining the Dao of the nine and the five, it becomes the imperial thunderclap. *Renzi* is the root of the east, *bingzi* the source of the north. *Jia* is thunder, *geng* the thunderclap, and *jia-geng* the command of thunder and thunderclap. *Ren* governs the configuration of thunder, *bing* its convergence, and *zi* its lineage. Within *jia* lies *si*, within *ren* lies *ding*, within *bing* lies *xin*, and within *geng* lies *yi*. Therefore, *jia*, *geng*, *bing*, and *ren* preside over thunder, while *yi*, *xin*, *ding*, and *si* preside over the thunderclap. Only *wu* and *gui* transform into fire, emptying their center, thus becoming the sovereign of thunder and thunderclap.\n\nAs for the Dao of the nine and the five, thunder and thunderclap proceed from north to east, from *zi* to *si*, all yang. By attaining the Dao of the nine and the five in thunder, one commands the awe of heaven and can thereby flourish and wither the myriad things, initiating and extinguishing the four seasons. Now, I, the Lord of the Five Thunders, have attained the Dao of the three and the one in thunder. Three is the ancestral number of the east, and one the generative number of the north. Thus, *zi* of the northern quarter forms the configuration of thunder, while *mao* of the eastern quarter serves as its gate. Attaining the three and the one differs not from the nine and the five—both are the Dao of thunder.\n\nWe, your servants, oversee the thunderclap, wielding the authority of heaven and earth. Fortunate to know the ancient origins, how dare we not expound them fully? Yet we fear to weary your true compassion with our humble words. The Investigator of the Nine Heavens remained silent.\n\nThe Old Lord said: \"You have enlightened me with your sincere hearts—your loyalty is admirable and worthy of reverence. If your words are true, then I possess ancient merit. Now, the Lord of the Five Thunders excels in overseeing the Investigator, which is my deepest aspiration. You should all understand this.\n\nIn the beginning of the kalpa, the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity was the successor of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Floating Radiance. Her eldest son became the Heavenly Venerable of Jade Clarity of Primordial Commencement, while her ninth son held the position of the Supreme Divine King of the Numinous Empyrean of Jade Clarity, the Great Emperor of Longevity, who exclusively governs the Nine Empyreans and the Thirty-Six Heavens. The Thirty-Six Heavenly Venerables are under the command of the Great Emperor, who wields the primordial image and controls yin and yang. Thus, the administration of thunder and thunderclap is entirely subordinate to him. The configuration of thunder lies in the north, its gate in the east, its fire in the south, and its command in the west. *Jia*, *geng*, *bing*, and *ren* constitute the yang thunder, while *yi*, *xin*, *ding*, and *si* constitute the yin thunderclap. *Wu* and *gui* serve as the overseers of thunder fire. Therefore, the Investigator of the Nine Heavens commands the four seasons, controls the five phases, and is indeed the True King.\n\nAll the spirits and gods spoke in unison: \"We, your servants, have been fortunate since our former lives, and only now do we come to understand.\" Upon hearing these words, the Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Commencement returned to the Great Veil, the Lord of the Jade Capital also returned to his true realm, and the Most High Old Lord soon returned to the Grand Clarity. Thereupon, the Investigator of the Nine Heavens also returned to the Palace of Purple Mystery and Radiant Brilliance.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord of the Vast Courtyard of the Empyrean soon addressed the Perfected Lord of Myriad Blessings of the Grand Sovereign, saying: \"We, the myriad heavens of the ten directions and the dragon spirits, each leading our respective domains, shall hasten our chariots to the Nine Empyreans to pay homage to the True King. We shall present the compassionate words of the Heavenly Venerable to report on the True King’s former mandate, thereby comforting the perceptions of the myriad spirits across the Three Realms.\"\n\nHe replied: \"So be it.\" At that time, the Heavenly Lord and the myriad heavens of the ten directions together proceeded to the Nine Empyreans. First, they stood beneath the Jade Clarity Gate of the Nine Empyreans, where the Chamberlain of the Jade Pivot, leading his officials, emerged to stand at the gate. Nine tigers stood in formation, and six dragons lay across the path. The chamberlain came forth to greet them, and only after some time were they permitted to enter. They then passed through the Jade Palace Gate of the Nine Empyreans. Within the gate hung a plaque of luminous jade inscribed with the words: \"Heaven of the Supreme Divine Empyrean.\"\n\nAt its center stood five halls: the Eastern Hall of Azure Radiance, the Southern Hall of Concentrated Spirit, the Western Hall of Jasper Jade, the Northern Hall of Floral Pearl, and the Central Hall of Longevity. There were also the Eastern and Western Flowery Terraces, the Four Offices and Four Bureaus, and beyond them, the Pavilion of the Great Brahma and the Purple Tenuity, and the Hall of the Immortals’ Fire and Thunder. Additionally, there were the Jade Pivot Court, the Five Thunders Court, the Court of the Yang Clan, the Court of the Immortals’ Fire and Thunder, the General Bureau of Thunder, the Bureau of the Great Monad Thunder, the Bureau of the Northern Emperor Thunder, the Penglai General Water Bureau, and countless other offices, courts, and bureaus, each with their own generals and officers.\n\nAbove were the Supreme, Mysterious, and General Ministries of Thunder, the Three Ministries and Six Boards, the Eight Temples and Four Bureaus, and various other offices, pavilions, and halls, each with its own officials. The Eastern and Western Flowery Terraces were all subordinate to them.\n\nAt that time, the myriad heavens of the ten directions all paid their respects before the King. The King dispatched a Jade Youth of Incense Attendance and a Jade Maiden of Chariot Attendance, each one, to express sincerity before the Heavenly Lord. The Heavenly Lord then addressed them, saying: \"The Great Emperor and True King, burdened by the affairs of the Three Realms, regrets not having earlier allowed his chariot wheels to divide his form and scatter his shadow to receive you in separate halls. On the fifth day of the fifth month, he shall open the Southern Palace, the Fiery Bell, the Jade Pupil, and the Flying Radiance Residence, where all are invited to gather.\"\n\nThe heavenly beings lingered, reluctant to depart, and again instructed the Jade Maiden to report to the King, saying: \"The myriad heavens of the ten directions, following the words of the Heavenly Venerable, address the Great Emperor and True King. The heavens possess the Mysterious Scripture, and the scripture contains its wondrous purport. In the beginningless kalpa, it was also expounded and named *The Supreme Jade Clarity of the Nine Empyreans, Great Brahma, Purple Tenuity, Mysterious Capital, Thunder, and Jade Scripture*. Having heard these words, we eagerly desire to hear it at once.\" The Jade Maiden returned and reported this.\n\nAfter the report, the Great Emperor assented. The Great Emperor commanded the Marshal of the Northern Dipper’s Punitive Bureau and the Marshal of the Northern Dipper’s Defensive Bureau, saying: \"The myriad heavens of the ten directions wish for me to expound the scripture. It is my secret treasure, and the Heavenly Venerable has decreed it. You may accompany the Grand Commandant, the Thunder Marshal of the Crimson Standard and Yellow Axe, the Grand Preceptor, the Grand Minister of Thunder, and the officials of the Judgment Bureau, the Prefecture, the Assistant Prefectures, and the Clerks, along with the Vice Ministers, the Directors, the Gentlemen-in-Waiting, the Registrars, and the most capable administrative officials, to attend my jade chariot and ascend the Three Heavens.\"",

The Great Emperor ascended the *Primordial Sovereign Cavern-True General Void Great Cloud* palanquin, with the Three Ministries, Five Bureaus, Six Boards, Eight Temples, and the hundred officials following in attendance. White cranes sang, green luan birds chanted, qilin danced upon the clouds, and baize howled in the wind. The Great Emperor’s imperial carriage proceeded, trailed by the carriages of the hundred officials. Fire wheels and fire palaces flanked the procession, the Four Guards on left and right, jade tigers winging ahead, and golden dragons escorting behind, arriving at the gates of the Three Heavens.\n\nFirst, he paid homage to the *Supreme Jade Capital Grand Ultimate Left Palace Immortals* and the *Elder of Heavenly Mechanism* at the *Heavenly Mechanism Ministry*. Next, he paid homage to the *Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces, the Illustrious Great Envoy* at the *Heavenly Pivot Ministry*. Then, he paid homage to the *Three Heavens’ Upholder of the Dao, Auxiliary of the Primordial Great Dharma Master* at the *Grand Mystery Capital Ministry*. Finally, he paid homage to the *Jade Clarity Primordial Beginning Dharma Master, Grand Preceptor of the Jade Hall* at the *Phoenix Pavilion*.\n\nHe then ascended to pay respects to the *Supreme Limitless Great Dao*, the *Supreme Elder*, the *Supreme Dao Lord*, the *Supreme Lord Lao*, the *Heavenly Thearch*, the *Heavenly Thearch Elder*, the *Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital*, the *Nine Qi Elder*, the *Hundreds of Thousands of Layers of Dao Qi’s Twelve Hundred Official Lords*. Having completed his obeisance before the *Great Emperor of the Jade Clarity*, he again bestowed the *Great Elixir Jade Talisman* upon the *Orthodox and Black Paths’ Stewards of the Vast Qi Realm of the Big Dipper’s Wind*. Next, all the thunder departments between Heaven and Earth, along with their related officials, and the assembled spirits and gods, gathered behind the Great Emperor.\n\nThe Great Emperor ascended to audience with the Three Clarities. The Jade Maidens of the Three Clarities scattered jade blossoms, which drifted upon the Big Dipper’s wind. Divine mist and jade clouds wafted through the distant purple capital. The Great Emperor, holding his ritual tablet and clad in solemn robes, stood to the right of the dais.\n\nThe *Great Brahma Radiant Dawn Attendant* proclaimed: \"The Most Venerable Supreme Heavenly Thearch, the Limitless and Supreme Emperor, takes his throne—this is the *Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable*.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"Since you have come, my brother, I have thirty-six thousand officials, and my palace has thirty-six thousand chief palace maidens, who oversee the affairs of thirty-six thousand worlds—yet I still find it beneath me. You are my brother; why trouble yourself so?\"\n\nThe Great Emperor rose in reverence and reported: \"I speak of the *Supreme Nine Empyrean Jade Clarity Great Brahma Purple Tenuity Mysterious Capital Thunder Jade Scripture*—a treasure transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, hidden since the division of primordial chaos. This treasure ought to be revealed; I dare not keep it secret nor claim its teachings as my own.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"Very well.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor took his leave. The Heavenly Venerable commanded the *Great Luo Limitless Divine Duke* and the *Three Heavens’ Grand Chancellor* to meet at the *Jade Brahma Radiant August* palace, where they convened with the *Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven* and the *August Earth Deity*. The Great Emperor sat beneath the Heavenly Thearch, the Earth Deity sat beneath the Great Emperor, the Divine Duke sat facing the Great Emperor, and the Grand Chancellor sat beneath the Divine Duke.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable bestowed jade nectar, followed by the *Great Tenuity Golden Liquid*. For the feast, eight qilin were served as jerky, nine phoenixes as preserved meat, three dragons as roasts, and four tigers as minced delicacies. After a long while, the drinking concluded, and the Divine Duke and Grand Chancellor took their leave together.\n\nThe Great Emperor again paid homage to the *Jade Clarity Great Emperor*, commanding the *Four Bureaus of the Longevity Palace* and the *Left and Right Recorders* to transcribe the scripture that very day. He then presented his thanks to the Three Heavens, with the Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August joining in the offering.\n\nThe Great Emperor returned to sit in the *Longevity Palace*. The Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August sat together in the jade carriage, while the ten directions’ myriad heavens all had their own jade palanquins. The dragon spirits of the various heavens stood along the steps of the dais.\n\nThe Great Emperor sat in silence for a long while, then intoned the incantation: \"*Thunder One, Thunder Two, Thunder Three, Thunder Four, Thunder Five—Om Hum Hum, Tri-dhāna, Auḥ Hī Vi Gaṃ Bili Caṭa.* Hasten, hasten!

      "translated_text": "\"Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands! *Om Hum Hum, Han-nan-yan Qian-yi She.*\n\nThe Great Emperor then addressed the Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August, saying: 'These ten directions’ myriad heavens now wish to hear the exposition of the true essence.'\n\nThe Heavenly Thearch and Earthly August replied to the Great Emperor: 'The ten directions’ myriad heavens have long awaited this grace. Your Majesty’s compassion is boundless—how could it be withheld?'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'I have just completed the incantation. Let us wait a moment.'\n\nAfter a short while, the Five Marshals led their hosts—dragon soldiers and tiger cavalry—summoning wind and howling rain, flying thunder and flashing lightning, scattering clouds and pealing thunderclaps. The uproar shook the heavens, and lightning flickered in dazzling bursts. The Great Emperor commanded the Five Thunder Envoys to strike the Five Thunder Command Tablet once. At once, heaven and earth fell silent, and the Great Emperor began his discourse.\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'I am the son of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance and the Divine Mother of Jade Purity, the younger brother of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity, and the uncle of the Most High Lord Lao. My wives are the sun and moon, my kin the stars, my servants wind and thunder, my chariots clouds and mist. I emerge from nonbeing into being, conceal the sacred and manifest the mundane, ride the void and harness the dawn, traverse the empty and tread the celestial. The Three Officials soar in my wake, and the Five Emperors follow in my radiance. How could I, though exalted, fail to act? Thus, I devote my heart to the Three Realms and exert my strength in the Five Phases. Of this, all you heavenly dragons and spirits—who does not know?'\n\nAt that moment, the Thunder Gods and Fire Masters, bearing their tablets and scepters, stood before the Great Emperor. Bowing deeply and kneeling, they said: 'Alas! In this forsaken world, all sentient beings—rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, husbands and wives, elder and younger brothers, hosts and guests, friends and relatives, servants and slaves, creatures of feather, fur, scale, and shell, those that fly, walk, move, or grow, from root to sprout, from sentient to insentient—from kalpas past to the present, since the dawn of existence, have endured eons of toil and dust. The stains of this life’s deeds cling to them. Greed, wrath, delusion, and desire sprout in the conduct of their lives. Killing, stealing, and licentiousness take shape in the rise of thought and the stir of intent. Three poisons of the heart, four evils of the tongue—one’s faults multiply a hundredfold, one’s own a thousandfold. This leaky, illusory body bears boundless transgressions. The sea of right and wrong is vast, the mountain of self and other looms high. How can they escape the decree of thunder?'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'Before heaven and earth existed, I already was. Before I existed, the root already was. The root of life and the origin of death are the gates of heaven’s palace and earth’s law. The cycle of birth and death turns like ants on a millstone. If one were to claim birth and death do not exist, then heaven and earth would have no day or night, and day and night would have no sun or moon. Thus, birth and death cannot be absent. And within them dwell fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, glory and decay, favor and disgrace, right and wrong, self and other, fame and profit, wealth and rank—all are bound to the cycle of birth and death, to which life and destiny are tied. Therefore, in the northeast lies the Wind-Thunder Hell, which is but the wrath of the thunder decree. For minor transgressions, the Great One reviews the records. For greater sins, the Three Corpses report above. For the gravest offenses, the Three Officials wield their brushes, and the wind-knives arrive at once. For the most heinous crimes, the matter falls to the thunder’s jurisdiction. In the yang realm, there is the punishment of flogging corpses; in the yin realm, the law of dismemberment. Whispers in the human world are heard in heaven like thunder; deceit in the dark is seen by the gods like lightning. Can one not be cautious?\n\nOf scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants, of monks, nuns, Daoists, and laity—from the Son of Heaven to the common folk—when fate is struck by comets or the body plagued by demonic disturbances, it is the governance of my thunder that truly descends upon them.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'Thunder governs heaven’s weal and woe, holds the scales of all things. It oversees beings and people, controls life and death, inspects and restrains, opens and closes, guards the keys of creation. From the Heavenly Sovereign above to the Earthly Thearch below, none can issue their decrees without thunder. From life and death in the great to glory and decay in the small, none can administer their governance without thunder. The decrees of thunder have their subordinates. Those who serve the decrees of thunder each have their lords. Today, I will explain them to you one by one. All must revere and obey them with awe.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'The Three Pure Ones and the Most Sacred are the ancestors of thunder. The Ten Ultimate Honored Ones are the root of thunder. The Jade Emperor of the August Heaven issues the commands of thunder. The August Earthly Thearch of the Rear Land regulates thunder.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'I am the Highest Divine Radiant Jade Purity True King, the Longevity Great Emperor of the Divine Empyrean. Next in rank are the Eastern Ultimate Azure Flower Great Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation through the Thunder’s Resonance of the Nine Heavens, the Great Emperor Ancestor of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Great Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity Azure Jade Palace of the Highest Purity, the Great Emperor of the Six Heavens’ Abyssal Cavern, the Lord Emperor of the Six Waves’ Heaven, the True Lord Controller of the Han, the True Lord Investigator of the Nine Heavens—these are the Nine Celestial Lords of the Divine Empyrean.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'Do you, the assembled hosts of the ten directions’ myriad heavens, understand? Thus, when the lower world seeks to avert water or fire, sever baleful stars or fell demonic shrines, cut off dragons or repel tigers, dispel pestilence or ward off evil, resolve the celestial net above or the earthly calamities below—when there are yearly disasters, monthly misfortunes, life-threatening stars, karmic adversities from three lifetimes, seven generations of inauspicious encounters, curses from ghosts and spirits, or demonic afflictions—whether fatal or survivable, resolved or unresolved—all must be reported to the Nine Celestial Lords, then submitted to the various bureaus.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'The True Lord Judges of the Jade Palace, the Left and Right Chamberlains of the Jade Palace, the Left and Right Chief Ministers, the Heavenly Thunder Prime Ministers, the Jade Pivot Envoys, the Dipper Pivot Prime Ministers, the Highest Purity Life Controllers, the Right Ministers of the Jade Palace, the Envoys of the Five Thunder Courts, the Thunder Commanders-in-Chief, the True Lords of Original Destiny—these are the pivotal offices of thunder, hence called the Nine Bureaus. All must be reported to them. Additionally, the Five Directional Thunder Kings and the Great Emperor Lords of the Five Directional Thunders must also be reported to.'\n\nThe Great Emperor said: 'The Sun Palace’s Great Yang Emperor Lord relies on thunder for his might.'\"",

The dragon spirits of the various heavens stood along the steps of the dais.\n\nThe Great Emperor sat in silence for a long while, then intoned the incantation: \"*Thunder One, Thunder Two, Thunder Three, Thunder Four, Thunder Five—Om Hum Hum, Tri-dhāna, Auḥ Hī Vi Gaṃ Bili Caṭa.* Hasten, hasten!

      "translated_text": "The Moon Palace’s Great Yin August Lord relies on thunder for his numinous power. The Nine August Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper rely on thunder for their pivotal governance.\n\nIn former times, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy commanded the Supreme Clarity’s Most High Primordial Lord, ordering the Grand Immortal Scribe of the Nine Provinces, the Luminous Great Envoy, to adjudicate matters of the Thunder Bureau’s Grand Ministry. The Supreme Jade Capital’s Great Ultimate Left Palace Immortal Elder adjudicated matters of the Thunder Bureau’s Mysterious Ministry. The Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Master Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial adjudicated matters of the Thunder Bureau’s General Ministry. Furthermore, the Great Immortal Fuqiu was convened to oversee the affairs of the Three Ministries of Thunder. The remaining offices and bureaus were all assigned to their respective jurisdictions.\n\nSome were called concurrent offices, others branch offices. Where they were dispatched to govern, if they were to inspect and supervise the official bureaus, they were called traveling offices. When the four offices had vacancies, all were to be filled by selection. In former kalpas, they had already been selected and promoted. These four offices were once again to descend into the world, overseeing households and transforming the people. Upon the completion of their merit, they would return to their respective jurisdictions.\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"All you heavens of the ten directions, you should know that this scripture is profoundly wondrous and not to be disseminated to inferior scholars. In the past, I received the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, commanding me to issue talismans and writs from the Nine Empyreans’ Jade Clarity Palace, proclaiming and transmitting mandates, conferring registers and charters, delivering the living and the dead—those born into bodies receiving deliverance, the souls of the dead undergoing refinement, escaping the hells, ascending to perfection, and transcending fate. All these are the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic mandates, to be obeyed and enacted by the Nine Empyreans. Within this Heaven of the Nine Empyreans’ Jade Clarity, I oversee the Vermilion Numinous Fire Palace, the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity’s Refinement Bureau, the Lower Palace of Southern Prosperity’s Deliverance Bureau, the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, and the Grand Clarity’s Yellow Register Universal Radiance Office.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning issued a mandate appointing three officials to administer talismanic commands, subordinate to my original heaven. He commanded the Great Luo’s Boundless Divine Duke to adjudicate matters of the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, styled as the Perfected Yu Luo Qiao—this was the first. He further commanded the Jade Clarity’s Primordial Beginning Dharma Master to serve as the Envoy of the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, styled as the Perfected True Radiance—this was the second. Next, he commanded the Grand Master of the Jade Hall’s Great Teachings to serve as the Deputy Envoy of the Supreme Clarity’s Yellow Register Court, styled as the Perfected Radiant Wondrous Sound—this was the third. With these three assistants, I oversee the affairs of this heaven’s deliverance of the living and the dead. All matters of refinement and deliverance must first be reported to the Nine August Ones, then submitted to the Nine Bureaus. Only afterward may the Three Assistants be informed, the Three Ministries be petitioned, and the offices of the Sun and Moon Palaces and the Northern Dipper’s bureaus be notified. Thus, one may pass through the barriers of all heavens, command the earthly deities, and universally proclaim to the Three Realms. If this is not done, even a thousand talismans and a hundred writs will be as nothing before the vastness of heaven and earth.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"If the emperors and sovereigns of the human world, in their efforts to safeguard the nation’s mandate, pacify the common people, harmonize the four seasons, regulate the two qi, are able to have this scripture’s principles woven into brocade, adorned with golden caskets, encased in stone chests, and enshrined within the seas and mountains, then the people will dwell in peace, winds and rains will come in due season, the hundred grains will flourish, all things will thrive, the nation will know no warfare, and the customs will be marked by wealth and longevity. Wherever this scripture resides, there will be Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, Heavenly Ding and Valiant Warriors, Wolf Clerks and Tiger Guards, Heavenly Armored Soldiers, Inspectors of Deceit and Hook Cavalry, Chief Ministers of the Capital Bureaus, Post Station and Relay Officials, Station Magistrates and Gale Wind Officers, Relay and Courier Clerks, Mounted Memorial Clerks, Flying Talisman and Demolished Shrine Clerks, Yin Spirit Judgment Clerks, Yang Spirit Judgment Clerks, and Flying Dragon Courier Clerks—all will follow to protect and uphold it.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor further addressed the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions: \"In the past, in the Azure Vault of Floating Radiance Heaven, I, along with the Boundless Great Sages of the Ten Directions, attended the Primordial Beginning amidst the Jeweled Millet of Empty Song. The Primordial Beginning expounded the *Great Numinous Chapter of Primordial Azure*. At that time, I made a great vow, saying: ‘After five hundred kalpas, when the fate of the world is adverse and the people suffer calamities, their corpses will pile as high as mountains, their blood will flow across the wilderness, and there will be no return to the present age of myriad phenomena’s great peace, where yin and yang are free from harm. Thunder executes the central qi of heaven and earth, governs the central administration of heaven and earth, investigates and adjudicates fortune and misfortune, assists in governing the celestial pivot, commands yin and yang, and oversees the earth’s records. As the lord of thunder, I should take the lead, even to the point of replacing them, so that all sentient beings may be freed from demonic afflictions. Yet my merit and effort in this cannot compare to the Primordial Beginning’s expounding of this numinous chapter, which is so profoundly wondrous that people may awaken through it. Now, this scripture of mine is no different in its purport. It is also through this scripture that my profound assembly is revealed. All sentient beings who hear this scripture, when their jade towers’ qi is severed and their silver seas’ flowers wither, will immediately attain deliverance and not pass through hell.’\"\n\nAt that time, the heavens of the ten directions simultaneously bowed their heads and proclaimed it good. The Heavenly Emperor and Earthly Sovereign also said, \"Excellent!\" The devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits rejoiced greatly. Golden Lads danced with incense, and Jade Maidens scattered flowers.\n\nThe Great Emperor said: \"When people’s thoughts arise and their actions move, if they act unvirtuously—offending heaven and earth, defiling the sun and moon, reviling winds and rains, exposing themselves to the stars, turning their backs on rulers and teachers, insulting parents, deceiving friends, arrogantly scorning neighbors, killing and harming living beings, wasting grain, using false weights and measures, deceiving sages, enforcing cruel laws, mutilating bodies, injuring and slaughtering birds and beasts, engaging in secret lewdness and theft, teaching poison and aiding villains, coveting honors, and resenting the weak—then heaven will be angered, earth will be enraged, ghosts will resent them, and spirits will detest them. If they can command the officials of the Nine Empyreans’ various bureaus and the First-Rank Immortal Officials of the Upper Primordial, or Orthodox Unity Daoists, to establish altars and make vows in monastery retreats or within their homes, and invite the recitation of this Jade Scripture—whether for one day, three days, five days, or seven days—they should first report to the upper spirits, confess their transgressions, and pray for the protection of their original destiny’s hun souls, beseeching their concealment in the Jade Palace and their submission to the Heavenly Ding for action. For this reason, the Three Officials will cease their indictments, the Black Registers will halt their pursuits, they will be spared from thunder’s wrath, and will not incur heavenly punishment. Turning their hearts toward goodness, they will attain good fortune.\"",

Command them to swiftly expel water monsters, block raging waves, annihilate malevolent remnants, and prevent harm to the people.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: For the rites of expiating fire, one must petition the Southern Fire Star Lord, the Fire Deity Zhu Rong Lord, the Thunder-Fire Gatekeeper Lord, the Fire Department’s Huilu Lord, the Fire Bell General, and issue writs to the Southern Fire Department’s Fire-Controlling Great Deities, the Five Directions’ Flying Fire, Hurling Fire, and Flowing Fire Great Deities, the Golden Scripture Fire-Administering Great Immortals, the Fire Department Judges, the Bing-Ding Lads, the Fire-Conquering Generals, and the Radiant Light Great Deities. Command them to purge fire calamities, purify the people’s lands, and prevent scorching flames from spreading their poison.\n\nWhen the myriad clans perform rites to avert water or expiate fire, they must also issue writs to the Grand Year’s [Year Name] Lord, as water belongs to the Lunar Palace and fire to the Solar Palace.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: When baleful stars appear over a kingdom or malevolent luminaries shine upon a person, this is due to the Primordial Beginning’s method of shifting stars and altering constellations. As for ominous stars and rebellious constellations that do not belong to the Five August Ones, the Eleven Luminaries, the Twenty-Eight Mansions, or the stars within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, all may be slain. First, memorialize the Nine Celestial Offices, then petition the Nine Bureaus, and next memorialize the Northern Culmen’s Purple Tenuity Great Emperor and petition the Northern Dipper’s Seven Kings’ Palace, allowing them to naturally sever and cast them down.\n\nThe destruction of shrines follows a different procedure. For any shrine deity that is unrighteous, one must first issue a writ to the local City God, then submit a memorial. On any *bing* day, one may submit a petition, and there will be an investigation; the authorities will carry it out without fail.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: Should there be those gravely ill beyond cure, their four limbs bereft of protection, one must memorialize and request the Heavenly Physician Envoys, the Divine Medicine Officers, the Healing Envoys, and the Golden Moxibustion Lads to come and provide treatment. Upon petition, Jade *qi* will flow and transform, divine elixirs will descend to revive the august people, restoring their spiritual countenance. If afflicted by malevolent forces, proceed likewise.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: Subduing flood dragons follows the same method as averting water. To repel tigers, summon the local Earth Deities, the Divine Tiger Jade Maidens, and the Jade Maidens who command tigers. For the method of halting epidemics, issue writs to the Five Pestilence Envoys and the Grand Year’s Venerable Deity, and all must submit documents to the Thunder Bureau.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: Should ghosts and spirits masquerade as ancestral spirits, demanding sacrifices and transforming into a hundred monstrosities to coerce offerings—hurling bricks and tiles, pounding on doors and gates, scattering sand and setting fires, startling chickens and teasing dogs, hanging snakes and suspending rats, casting shadows and transmitting voices—all who harm people daily shall be judged by their crimes.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: In the Nine Heavens’ Jade Purity Prefecture reside the Eastern Numinous Grand Minister, the Auspicious Light Immortal Master, the Six Flowers’ Jade Thunder Envoy, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Snow-Commanding General, and the Wind-Returning Cloud-Weaving Envoy, who oversee matters of snow and hail, subordinate to the Lunar Palace’s Grand Yin Sovereign.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: When a land suffers from severe drought, its people parched and scorched, fish and birds distressed, grasses and trees withered and brittle, malevolent spirits wreaking havoc, flames scorching the sky, a canopy of fire spreading in all four directions, and a thousand *li* of reddened earth, one must petition the Eastern Well and Winnowing Basket Star Envoys, the Heavenly Gate’s Eastern Wall Envoy, the Metal Gate and Net Star Envoys, the Three Mountains’ Great Unity Wood Lad Great Deity, and the Four Seas’ Four Ding Great Deities, commanding them to drive dragons to gather water, summon clouds, and bring forth rain.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: For prolonged, excessive rains, one should report to the local City Gods, Earth Gods, and Village Boundary Officers, stating that embankments have collapsed and ditches overflowed. Memorialize the Grand Sun’s Nine Dragon Sovereign, beseeching the dispatch of the Nine Dippers’ Yang Essence Flowing Metal Fire Bell Great General to seal the depths, lock the seas, halt the rain, restrain the dragons, roll back the mists, gather the clouds, and unveil the heavens to shine the sun.\n\nThe Great Emperor declares: You, the Thunder Deities and Fire Masters, know my manifold expedient means, which I have deigned to teach. Now that this scripture has been expounded—a text rarely encountered—should anyone obtain it yet fail to keep it secret, treating it with carelessness and disdain, know that such a person will disrupt the Three Primordials and incur transgressions recorded in the Eight Registers. Those who uphold it may manifest numinous power, for it is governed by the Five Directions’ Thunder Deities and Officers, whom I shall now explain one by one.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Fire Masters replied: We understand. We request to proclaim it.\n\nBefore the Great Emperor, the Thunder Deities and Fire Masters prostrated themselves, knelt reverently, and addressed him: We have heard that the Five Directions’ Thunder Deities and Officers have long received the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s prophecy, assisting and aiding the True King in governing the administration of thunder. Wishing to instruct the world, yet without your decree, we have kept it secret. We now declare:\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Eastern Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Hu Feng Ya, Duo Zhe Li, and Yi Jiu Luo.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Southern Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Bing Jiu Lu, Nuan Yan Liao, and Shi A Xiong.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Western Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Rong Yao Ling, Lang Zhong Yan, and Shan Jiu Tuo.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Northern Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Lu Xing Meng, Heng Tian Ba, and Zhao Zhen Jiu.\n\nThe Thunder Deities and Officers of the Central Direction’s wind, rain, clouds, and lightning are Sun Zhen Er, Duo Bo Yan, and Xu Zhi Gui.",
