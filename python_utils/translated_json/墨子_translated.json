To see the worthy and not act with urgency is to neglect one’s lord. Without the worthy, there is no urgency; without the *shi*, there is no one with whom to deliberate on the state’s affairs. That a state could survive while neglecting the worthy and forgetting the *shi* has never been known.\n\nIn ancient times, Duke Wen fled into exile yet rectified the world; Duke Huan left his state yet commanded the feudal lords; King Goujian of Yue endured the humiliation of King Fuchai of Wu, yet still became one of the worthy rulers of the Central States. These three men achieved fame and success throughout the world precisely because they had suffered humiliation and great disgrace in their own states.\n\nThe highest level is to avoid defeat; the next is to suffer defeat yet still achieve success—this is what it means to employ the people.\n\nI have heard it said: It is not that there is no secure dwelling, but that I have no secure heart. It is not that there is no sufficient wealth, but that I have no contented heart. Thus, the noble person makes things difficult for himself and easy for others, while the common people make things easy for themselves and difficult for others.\n\nThe noble person advances without compromising his resolve; he examines his true feelings within. Though mingled with the mediocre, he harbors no resentment, for he has confidence in himself. Therefore, one who does what is difficult will surely attain what he desires; I have never heard of one who pursues only what he desires and yet avoids what he detests.\n\nThus, flattering ministers harm their lord, and sycophantic subordinates harm their superiors. A lord must have ministers who refuse to yield; a superior must have subordinates who speak bluntly. Those who engage in endless debate and those who merely quarrel—how can they ensure long life and preserve the state?\n\nIf ministers value their ranks and titles yet remain silent, those near at hand will be benighted, and those far away will be estranged. Resentment will take root in the hearts of the people, flattery and obsequiousness will surround the ruler, and good counsel will be blocked—then the state is in peril.\n\nDid Jie and Zhou lack men of the world? They brought ruin upon themselves and lost the world. Therefore, it is said: To return a state’s treasures is not as good as presenting the worthy and advancing the *shi*.\n\nNow, if there are five awls, the sharpest will be the first to break. If there are five knives, the most finely whetted will be the first to wear down. Thus, sweet wells are the first to run dry; tall trees are the first to be felled; sacred tortoises are the first to be scorched; divine serpents are the first to be exposed.\n\nTherefore, the choking of Bi Gan was due to his uprightness; the killing of Meng Ben was due to his courage; the drowning of Xi Shi was due to her beauty; the dismemberment of Wu Qi was due to his deeds. Thus, those who excel in any way rarely escape death because of their strengths. Hence, it is said: Excess is difficult to sustain.\n\nTherefore, even a worthy lord does not cherish ministers without merit; even a loving father does not cherish a son who brings no benefit. Thus, one who cannot bear the responsibilities of his position does not deserve that position; one who cannot bear the duties of his rank does not deserve that emolument.\n\nA fine bow is difficult to draw, yet it can reach high and penetrate deep. A fine horse is difficult to ride, yet it can bear heavy burdens and travel far. A fine talent is difficult to command, yet it can bring honor to its lord and win respect.\n\nThus, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers do not reject the small streams that fill them, and so they become great. The sage, in his affairs, does not refuse; in his dealings with things, he does not oppose. Thus, he becomes a vessel for the world.\n\nTherefore, the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers do not come from a single source; a robe of a thousand *yi* is not made from the white fur of a single fox.\n\nHow can there be a case where one adopts the same method yet fails to achieve the same result? This is not the Way of the Universal King. Thus, Heaven and Earth do not shine with dazzling brilliance; great waters do not surge with mere torrents; great fires do not blaze with flickering flames; and the king’s virtue is not confined to Yao-like radiance. Only then can one become the leader of a thousand men. Straight as an arrow, level as a whetstone—this alone is insufficient to encompass all things. Therefore, narrow streams dry swiftly; shallow currents exhaust quickly; scorched lands yield no harvest. If these three—deep virtue, unobstructed flow, and fertile soil—do not extend beyond the palace, they cannot nourish the state.\n\n**Cultivating the Self (Second Chapter)**\nThough the gentleman engages in battle with formations, courage is his foundation; though mourning follows ritual, grief is its essence; though the scholar pursues learning, conduct is its root. Thus, if the root is not firmly planted, do not strive to flourish the branches. If those near are not won over, do not seek to attract those afar. If kin do not draw close, do not pursue external alliances. If affairs lack beginning and end, do not multiply undertakings. If a matter is not thoroughly examined, do not spread its fame.\n\nTherefore, the former kings in governing the world first scrutinized the near to reach the far. The gentleman examines the near and cultivates it. Seeing misconduct, facing slander, he reflects upon himself. Thus, resentment diminishes and conduct improves.\n\nMalicious words should not enter the ears; harsh sounds should not leave the mouth; the impulse to harm others’ children should not dwell in the heart. Even if there are slanderous people, they will have no foothold. Thus, the gentleman’s strength in affairs grows daily, his aspirations deepen, and his vigor flourishes.\n\nThe Way of the gentleman: in poverty, he manifests integrity; in wealth, he manifests righteousness; in life, he manifests love; in death, he manifests grief. These four virtues cannot be feigned—they must be embodied. What is stored in the heart must not exhaust love; what moves the body must not exhaust reverence; what issues from the mouth must not exhaust gentleness. Flowing through the four limbs, penetrating the skin and flesh, even as hair whitens and the temples turn purple, he does not abandon them—such is the sage alone.\n\nOne whose will is not strong will not attain wisdom. One whose words are not trustworthy will not achieve resolute action. One who clings to wealth and cannot share with others is unworthy of friendship. One who does not steadfastly uphold the Way, whose knowledge is narrow, whose judgment of right and wrong is unclear—such a person is unfit for companionship.\n\nIf the root is not firm, the branches will surely wither. One who is bold but does not cultivate himself will later grow indolent. If the source is turbid, the flow will not run clear. One whose conduct lacks sincerity will see his reputation dissipate. Fame does not arise spontaneously, nor does praise grow of itself. Only when merit is achieved and reputation established can fame and praise not be feigned—they must be embodied.\n\nOne who speaks much but acts slowly, though eloquent, will not be heeded. One who boasts of his strength and claims credit for achievements, though laborious, will not be rewarded. The wise discern with the heart but do not speak excessively; they are strong but do not boast of their merits. Thus, their fame and praise spread throughout the world.\n\nDo not strive for quantity in speech but for wisdom; do not strive for ornamentation but for discernment. For one who possesses wisdom but lacks discernment in himself, his emotions will lead him astray.\n\nGoodness that does not reside in the heart will not endure; conduct that is not distinguished in oneself will not stand. Fame cannot be achieved through simplicity, nor can praise be established through cunning. The gentleman carries his conduct upon his person. One who seeks profit while neglecting reputation, who forgets fame in pursuit of gain—such a person has never been fit to serve as a scholar in the world.\n\n**The Influence of Association (Third Chapter)**\nMaster Mozi said: Seeing one who dyes silk, he sighed and said, “Dyed in indigo, it becomes indigo; dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow. What enters changes, and its color changes with it. After five immersions, it will have five colors. Thus, dyeing cannot be taken lightly.”\n\nIt is not only silk that is so—states, too, have their influences. Shun was influenced by Xu You and Bo Yang; Yu by Gao Yao and Bo Yi; Tang by Yi Yin and Zhong Hui; King Wu by the Grand Duke and the Duke of Zhou. These four kings were rightly influenced, and so they ruled the world, became Son of Heaven, and their merit and fame covered Heaven and Earth. When the world’s benevolent and righteous are mentioned, these four kings must be named.\n\nJie of Xia was influenced by Gan Xin and Tui Dong; Zhou of Yin by Chong Hou and E Lai; King Li by Li Gong Changfu and Rong Yi Zhong; King You by Fu Gong Yi and Cai Gong Gu. These four kings were wrongly influenced, and so their states were ruined, their persons perished, and they became a disgrace to the world. When the world’s unjust and shameful are mentioned, these four kings must be named.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi was influenced by Guan Zhong and Bao Shu; Duke Wen of Jin by Jiu Fan and Gao Yan; King Zhuang of Chu by Sun Shu and Shen Yin; King Helü of Wu by Wu Zixu and Wen Yi; King Goujian of Yue by Fan Li and the Grand Minister Zhong. These five lords were rightly influenced, and so they became hegemons over the feudal lords, and their merit and fame were transmitted to later generations.\n\nFan Jishe was influenced by Chang Liu Shuo and Wang Zhu; Zhonghang Yin by Ji Qin and Gao Qiang; King Fuchai of Wu by Wangsun Xiong and the Grand Steward Pi; Zhibo Yao by Zhi Guo and Zhang Wu; Shang of Zhongshan by Wei Yi and Yan Chang; Kang of Song by Tang Yang and Xian Buli. These six lords were wrongly influenced, and so their states were ruined, their persons executed, their ancestral temples destroyed, their lineages extinguished, their ministers scattered, and their people fled. When the world’s greedy, violent, and oppressive rulers are mentioned, these six lords must be named.\n\nWhat is it that makes a ruler secure? It is his adherence to principle, and his adherence to principle lies in right influence. Thus, the good ruler labors in selecting men and is at ease in governing his officials. The incapable ruler harms his body and exhausts his spirit, worries his heart and wearies his mind, yet his state grows ever more perilous, and his person ever more disgraced. These six lords did not fail to value their states or love their persons—they simply did not know the essentials.\n\nThose who do not know the essentials are those whose influences are misaligned. Not only states have influences—scholars, too, have influences. If one’s friends all cherish benevolence and righteousness, are sincere, cautious, and respectful of the law, then one’s household prospers day by day, one’s person grows ever more secure, one’s name ever more honored, and in office one attains the proper order—such were the likes of Duangan Mu, Qinzi, and Fu Yue. If one’s friends all delight in arrogance and aggression, in scheming and factionalism, then one’s household declines day by day, one’s person grows ever more imperiled, one’s name ever more disgraced, and in office one loses the proper order—such were the likes of Zixi, Yi Ya, and Jian Diao. The *Odes* says: “One must choose what one embraces; one must be vigilant in what one embraces.” This is what it means.\n\n**Modeling the Standard, IV**\nMaster Mozi said: Those who engage in affairs under Heaven cannot be without a standard. There are none whose affairs succeed without a standard. Even the most eminent scholars who become generals or ministers all have standards, and even the humblest artisans who ply their trades all have standards. Artisans square things with the carpenter’s square, circle them with the compass, align them with the plumb line, and level them with the hanging weight. Whether skilled or unskilled, all take these five as their standard. The skilled can meet the mark, while the unskilled, though they may not meet it, still follow it in their work and thus surpass their own efforts. Therefore, all artisans have a standard by which they measure. Now, those who govern all under Heaven or rule great states yet lack a standard by which to measure—this is not as discerning as the artisans.\n\nWhat, then, should be taken as the standard for governance? Should all model themselves after their parents? There are many parents under Heaven, but the benevolent are few. If all modeled themselves after their parents, this would be modeling after what is not benevolent. To model after what is not benevolent cannot serve as a standard. Should all model themselves after their teachers? There are many scholars under Heaven, but the benevolent are few. If all modeled themselves after their teachers, this would be modeling after what is not benevolent. To model after what is not benevolent cannot serve as a standard. Should all model themselves after their rulers? There are many rulers under Heaven, but the benevolent are few. If all modeled themselves after their rulers, this would be modeling after what is not benevolent. To model after what is not benevolent cannot serve as a standard. Thus, parents, teachers, and rulers—none of these three can serve as a viable standard for governance.\n\nWhat, then, should be taken as the standard for governance? Therefore, it is said: Nothing is better than modeling after Heaven. Heaven’s conduct is vast and impartial, its bestowals generous yet without claim of virtue, its illumination enduring and unwaning. Thus, the sage-kings modeled themselves after it. Having taken Heaven as their standard, in all actions and undertakings, they measured themselves against Heaven. What Heaven desired, they did; what Heaven did not desire, they ceased. Yet what does Heaven desire, and what does it abhor? Heaven surely desires that people love and benefit one another, and does not desire that they hate and harm one another.\n\nHow do we know that Heaven desires people to love and benefit one another, and does not desire them to hate and harm one another? Because it universally loves and universally benefits them. How do we know that Heaven universally loves and universally benefits them? Because it universally possesses and universally nourishes them. Now, under Heaven, no state is too small or too great—all are Heaven’s domains. No person is too young or too old, too noble or too base—all are Heaven’s subjects. Thus, none fail to raise sheep, rear dogs and swine, prepare fine millet wine and sweet liquor, and offer rich sacrifices to reverently serve Heaven. Is this not universally possessing and universally nourishing them? If Heaven indeed universally possesses and nourishes them, how could it not desire that people love and benefit one another?\n\nTherefore, those who love and benefit others will surely receive Heaven’s blessings, while those who hate and harm others will surely incur Heaven’s calamities. Those who kill the innocent will meet with misfortune. How could it be that when people harm one another, Heaven would grant them blessings? Thus, Heaven desires that people love and benefit one another, and does not desire that they hate and harm one another.\n\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu universally cared for the hundred clans under Heaven, leading them to revere Heaven and serve the spirits. Their benefiting of others was great, so Heaven blessed them, establishing them as Sons of Heaven, and all the feudal lords under Heaven paid them homage. The violent kings Jie, Zhou, You, and Li universally harmed the hundred clans under Heaven, leading them to revile Heaven and insult the spirits. Their harming of others was great, so Heaven brought them calamity, causing them to lose their states, die in disgrace under Heaven, and be vilified by later generations and their descendants—even now, the condemnation does not cease.\n\nThus, those who do evil and incur calamity were like Jie, Zhou, You, and Li; those who love and benefit others and receive blessings were like Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. There have been those who loved and benefited others and received blessings, and likewise, there have been those who hated and harmed others and incurred calamities.\n\n**Seven Calamities, V**\nMaster Mozi said: A state has seven calamities. What are the seven calamities?\n1. When the city walls, moats, and pools cannot be defended, yet palaces and halls are constructed—this is the first calamity.\n2. When enemy states reach the borders, yet none of the four neighbors come to the rescue—this is the second calamity.\n3. When the people’s strength is exhausted on useless works, and rewards are bestowed upon the incapable, so that the people’s strength is spent on what is useless and treasures are depleted on entertaining guests—this is the third calamity.\n4. When officials serve for emoluments, wanderers worry about returning, the ruler enforces laws and punishes his ministers, and the ministers are cowed and dare not oppose him—this is the fourth calamity.\n5. When the ruler considers himself sagely and wise and does not consult on affairs, deems himself secure and strong and has no defenses, and when the four neighbors plot against him, he remains unaware and unprepared—this is the fifth calamity.\n6. When those he speaks to are not loyal, and those he trusts are not faithful—this is the sixth calamity.\n7. When grain and legumes are insufficient to feed the people, great ministers are insufficient to serve the state, rewards cannot please, and punishments cannot awe—this is the seventh calamity.\n\nTo govern a state with these seven calamities will surely lose the altars of soil and grain; to defend a city with these seven calamities, when the enemy arrives, the state will collapse. Where the seven calamities prevail, the state will surely suffer disaster.\n\nAll grains are what the people depend upon, and what the ruler relies on for sustenance. Thus, if the people have nothing to depend on, the ruler has no sustenance; if the people have no food, they cannot be employed. Therefore, the production of food cannot be neglected, the land cannot be left untended, and expenditures cannot be left unchecked. When all five grains are fully harvested, the ruler enjoys all five flavors; if not fully harvested, he does not enjoy them all. If one grain fails, it is called scarcity; if two fail, drought; if three fail, disaster; if four fail, dearth; if all five fail, famine. In a year of scarcity, officials from grand masters downward have their salaries reduced by one-fifth; in a drought, by two-fifths; in a disaster, by three-fifths; in a dearth, by four-fifths; in a famine, salaries are entirely suspended, and only rations are provided. Thus, when disaster and famine afflict the state, the ruler removes five-fifths of his bronze cauldrons for food, grand masters remove their suspended bells, scholars do not attend school, the ruler’s court robes remain unaltered, envoys from the feudal lords and neighboring states are served plain meals without delicacies, glue and leather are removed, roads go unweeded, horses are not fed grain, and concubines do not wear silk—this is the utmost sign of insufficiency.\n\nNow, if a man carrying his child draws water and drops the child into a well, the mother will surely follow to rescue it. Yet when the year is disastrous and the people starve by the roadside, some even abandon their own children—this suffering is worse than the child falling into the well. How can it go unexamined? Thus, in good years, the people are kind and virtuous; in bad years, they are stingy and wicked. What constant nature do the people possess? When those who produce are few and those who consume are many, the year cannot be abundant. Therefore, it is said: when wealth is insufficient, return to the seasons; when food is insufficient, return to frugality. Thus, the ancients generated wealth in accordance with the seasons, secured the fundamentals, and used resources sparingly—then wealth was sufficient. Even the sage-kings of antiquity could not ensure that the five grains always ripened and that droughts and floods never came. Yet why were there no people freezing or starving? Because they exerted themselves in timely labor and practiced self-restraint in sustenance. Thus, the *Book of Xia* states: \"Yu endured seven years of floods.\" The *Book of Yin* states: \"Tang endured five years of drought.\" These were severe calamities indeed. Yet why did the people not freeze or starve? Because they generated wealth diligently and used it frugally.\n\nTherefore, without stored grain, one cannot withstand famine; without stored weapons, even with righteousness, one cannot punish the unrighteous; without complete city walls, one cannot defend oneself; without prepared plans, one cannot respond to emergencies. It is like Qing Ji, who, without the resolve to flee, could not lightly venture out. Jie lacked preparations against Tang, so he was exiled; Zhou lacked preparations against King Wu, so he was killed. Though Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, they were both destroyed by rulers of a hundred *li*—why? Because they were wealthy and noble yet made no preparations. Thus, preparedness is the state’s weightiest concern. Food is the state’s treasure; weapons are the state’s claws; walls are its means of defense. These three are the state’s essentials. Therefore, it is said: to exhaust the treasury with lavish rewards for the undeserving, to deplete the storehouses for carriages, horses, fine robes, and curiosities, to exhaust the laborers with the construction of palaces and towers for pleasure, and to prepare extravagant coffins and multiple layers of burial garments—while alive, building terraces and pavilions, and in death, constructing grand tombs—this causes the people to suffer externally while the treasury is depleted internally, the ruler never sated with pleasure, and the people unable to bear their hardship. Thus, when the state faces enemies, it is harmed; when the people encounter famine, they perish—all due to the failure to maintain preparedness.\n\nMoreover, food is what the sage treasures. Thus, the *Book of Zhou* states: \"A state without three years’ worth of food is no true state; a household without three years’ worth of food has no true heir.\" This is called state preparedness.\n\n**Chapter on Excessive Expenditure, Part Six**\nMozi said: In ancient times, when the people did not yet know how to build palaces, they dwelled on hills and mounds, living in caves. The dampness below harmed them, so the sage-kings constructed palaces. The standards for palace construction were: height sufficient to avoid dampness, walls sufficient to block wind and cold, roofs sufficient to withstand snow, frost, rain, and dew, and palace walls high enough to distinguish the rites between men and women. Beyond this, no additional expenditures of wealth or labor were made without benefit. Thus, the sage-kings built palaces for the convenience of living, not for ostentation or pleasure. They made clothing, belts, and shoes for bodily comfort, not for extravagance. By moderating their own conduct and instructing the people, the people of the world could be governed, and resources could be made sufficient.\n\nToday’s rulers, however, build palaces differently. They heavily levy taxes on the people, violently seize their clothing and food, constructing palaces, terraces, and pavilions with winding views, adorned with blue and yellow carvings—such extravagance causes their attendants to imitate them. Thus, their wealth is insufficient to withstand famine or relieve orphans and widows, leaving the state impoverished and the people difficult to govern. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in palace construction.\n\nIn ancient times, before the people knew how to make clothing, they wore animal skins and bound themselves with straw. In winter, these were not light yet warm; in summer, not light yet cool. The sage-kings deemed this inadequate for human needs, so they instructed women to weave and labor, repairing city walls—thus, the people toiled without harm. By maintaining regular governance and collecting taxes, the people spent without suffering. What truly afflicted the people was not this.\n\nThe people suffered from heavy levies of silk and hemp, bundled cloth and silk, all to make garments for them. The method for making clothing was this: in winter, layered silk was sufficient to be both light and warm. This was all that was needed. Thus, the sages made clothing to fit the body, harmonize with the skin, and suffice—it was not to dazzle the eyes or impress the foolish. At that time, sturdy chariots and fine horses were not prized, nor were carvings and embroidery admired. Why? Because the Dao guided them thus. Therefore, when the people’s resources for clothing and food were such that each household could withstand drought, flood, or famine, why was this so? They understood the essence of self-sustenance and were not deluded by external things. Thus, the people were frugal and easy to govern, and their ruler spent sparingly and was easily supplied. Storehouses were full, sufficient to meet unforeseen needs; armor and weapons were not worn out, and soldiers and commoners were not overburdened, enough to subdue the disobedient. Thus, the enterprise of hegemons and kings could be realized throughout the world.\n\nToday’s rulers, however, make clothing differently. In winter, they wear light, warm garments; in summer, light, cool ones—all these are already provided. Yet they still heavily levy the people, violently seizing the resources for their clothing and food to make brocade, embroidery, and extravagant robes. They cast gold into hooks and use pearls and jade as ornaments; women labor over embroidery, and men carve and engrave, all to adorn themselves. This does not enhance warmth but merely exhausts wealth and labor, squandering them on useless things. From this, it is clear that their clothing is not for the body but for ostentation. Thus, the people become licentious and difficult to govern, and their rulers grow extravagant and hard to admonish. With such extravagant rulers governing such licentious people, to hope for no disorder is impossible. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in clothing.\n\nIn ancient times, before the people knew how to prepare food, they ate raw and lived apart. Thus, the sages taught men to plow, sow, and cultivate, providing food for the people. Their food was only to increase qi, fill hunger, strengthen the body, and satisfy the stomach—nothing more. Thus, they spent sparingly, lived frugally, and the people were wealthy while the state was well-ordered.\n\nToday, it is not so. Heavy levies are imposed on the people to prepare fine foods—fattened livestock, roasted and grilled fish and turtles. Great states pile up a hundred vessels; small states, ten. The spread stretches a square *zhang*, the eye cannot take it all in, the hand cannot grasp it all, the mouth cannot taste it all. In winter, the food freezes; in summer, it spoils. When rulers feast like this, their attendants imitate them. Thus, the wealthy grow extravagant, while orphans and widows freeze and starve. To hope for no disorder is impossible. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in food and drink.\n\nIn ancient times, before the people knew how to make boats and carts, heavy burdens could not be moved, and distant roads could not be reached. Thus, the sage-kings created boats and carts to facilitate the people’s affairs. Their boats and carts were sturdy, light, and efficient, capable of bearing heavy loads and traveling far. They required little expenditure but brought great benefit, so the people delighted in and profited from them. Thus, laws and orders were carried out without urgency, and the people were not overburdened yet had enough. Therefore, the people turned to them.\n\nToday’s rulers make boats and carts differently. Though sturdy, light, and efficient vessels are already provided, they still heavily levy the people to adorn them—embellishing carts with embroidery and boats with carvings. Women abandon their weaving to work on embroidery, so the people grow cold; men leave their plowing and sowing to carve and engrave, so the people go hungry. When rulers make boats and carts like this, their attendants imitate them. Thus, the people suffer both hunger and cold, leading to wickedness and banditry. The more this happens, the harsher the punishments; the harsher the punishments, the more the state falls into chaos. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in boats and carts.\n\nAll things between heaven and earth, within the four seas, the nature of heaven and earth, the harmony of yin and yang—none are not as they are. Even the greatest sages cannot alter them. How do we know this is so? The sages have transmitted: for heaven and earth, there are above and below; for the four seasons, there are yin and yang; for human nature, there are men and women; for birds and beasts, there are male and female. This is the true nature of heaven and earth, which even the former kings could not change.\n\nThough the sages of antiquity surely kept concubines, they did not let this harm their conduct. Thus, the people bore no resentment. There were no sequestered women in the palace, so there were no widowers in the world. With no sequestered women within and no widowers without, the people of the world multiplied.\n\nToday’s rulers, however, keep concubines—great states hold thousands, small states hundreds. Thus, in the world, many men are widowed without wives, and many women are sequestered without husbands. Men miss their time, so the people grow few. If a ruler truly desires a large population and hates scarcity, he must practice moderation in keeping concubines.\n\nThese five matters are what the sages practiced frugality and moderation in, and what petty men indulge in to excess. With frugality and moderation, there is prosperity; with excess and indulgence, there is ruin. These five cannot be left unmoderated. When husband and wife are moderate, heaven and earth are in harmony; when wind and rain are timely, the five grains ripen; when clothing is moderate, the skin and flesh are at ease.\n\n**Section Three, Chapter Seven**\nCheng Fan asked Mozi: \"The sage-kings did not make music.\"\n\nIn ancient times, the feudal lords wearied of governing and found repose in the music of bells and drums; the high officials wearied of governing and found repose in the music of flutes and zithers; the farmers, who plowed in spring, weeded in summer, harvested in autumn, and stored in winter, found repose in the music of earthen jars. Now you say the sage-kings did not make music—this is like driving a horse without unharnessing it, or drawing a bow without releasing it. Is this not something those with blood and qi cannot endure?\n\nMozi replied: In former times, Yao and Shun had *Di Qi*, which served as both ritual and music. Tang exiled Jie to the great waters, encircled the world, and established himself as king. With his affairs accomplished and no great future troubles, he created music and named it *Nine Summons*. King Wu vanquished Yin and killed Zhou, encircled the world, and established himself as king. With his affairs accomplished and no great future troubles, he followed the music of the former kings and also created his own, naming it *Elephant*. King Cheng of Zhou followed the music of the former sages and named it *Zhou Yu*. Yet King Cheng’s governance of the world was not equal to King Wu’s; King Wu’s governance was not equal to Tang’s; and Tang’s governance was not equal to Yao and Shun’s. Thus, the more elaborate their music, the less their governance flourished. From this, we see that music is not the means to govern the world.\n\nCheng Fan said: You claim the sage-kings had no music, yet this too is music. How can you say the sage-kings had no music?\n\nMozi replied: The sage-kings’ commands were measured in quantity. The benefit of food is known to those who eat when hungry—this is wisdom. Without such knowledge, one is ignorant. Now, if the sages had music but little of it, this too is as good as none.\n\nBi Yuan states: \"馁\" should be \"馁.\" *Shuowen Jiezi* says: \"矮 means hunger.\"\n\nIn the phrase preceding \"欲,\" the *Xian Gu* and *Jiao Zhu* editions follow Bi Yuan’s suggestion and add the character \"雖.\"\n\nFor \"止,\" the *Xian Gu* and *Jiao Zhu* editions follow Bi Yuan’s emendation, based on other versions, to \"上.\"\n\nThe *Xian Gu* and *Jiao Zhu* editions, following Wang Niansun’s citation of *Qunshu Zhiyao*, repeat the two characters \"奸裹.\"\n\nAfter \"日,\" the *Xian Gu* and *Jiao Zhu* editions follow Wang Niansun’s suggestion and add the three characters \"夫子曰.\"\n\nFor \"自作乐，命曰《九招》,\" the *Xian Gu* and *Jiao Zhu* editions follow Bi Yuan’s emendation, expanding it to: \"又自作乐，命曰《护》，又修《九招》。\"\n\nAfter \"乐,\" the *Xian Gu* and *Jiao Zhu* editions, following Wang Niansun’s emendation, add the four characters \"又自作乐,\" which is correct.\n\n*Mozi*, Scroll Two, \"Exalting Worthiness, Part One\" (Chapter Eight)\n\nMaster Mozi declared: In antiquity, lords and grandees who governed states all desired their nations to prosper, their people to multiply, and their penal administration to be well-ordered. Yet instead of prosperity, they met with poverty; instead of abundance, they met with scarcity; instead of order, they met with chaos. Thus, they lost what they desired and gained what they abhorred—what was the reason for this?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: It lies in the fact that lords and grandees governing states could not employ the principle of exalting worthiness and employing ability in their administration. For when a state possesses many men of worth and excellence, its governance is substantial; when such men are few, its governance is meager. Therefore, the paramount task of rulers is to multiply the worthy.\n\nIt may be asked: How then shall the multiplication of the worthy be safeguarded?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: Consider the case of one who desires to increase the number of skilled archers and charioteers in the state: he must enrich them, ennoble them, revere them, and praise them—only then can the state’s skilled archers and charioteers be multiplied. How much more so for men of worth and excellence, whose virtue and conduct are profound, whose speech and discourse are discerning, and whose mastery of the Dao and its safeguards is expansive? These are indeed the state’s treasures and the altars’ pillars. They too must be enriched, ennobled, revered, and praised—only then can the state’s good men be multiplied.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of old governed with this decree: \"What is unrighteous shall not be enriched; what is unrighteous shall not be ennobled; what is unrighteous shall not be befriended; what is unrighteous shall not be drawn near.\" When the state’s wealthy and noble heard this, they withdrew and deliberated, saying: \"Formerly, what we relied upon was our wealth and nobility. Now the ruler exalts righteousness without shunning poverty and lowliness—thus we cannot but act righteously.\" When those close to the ruler heard this, they too withdrew and deliberated, saying: \"Formerly, what we relied upon was our closeness. Now the ruler exalts righteousness without shunning distance—thus we cannot but act righteously.\" When those far from the ruler heard this, they too withdrew and deliberated, saying: \"Formerly, I thought remoteness left me without reliance. Now the ruler exalts righteousness without shunning remoteness—thus I cannot but act righteously.\" Even the ministers of distant borderlands, the attendants of the palace courtyards, the masses within the state, and the common folk of the four frontiers—all who heard this vied to act righteously.\n\nWhat was the reason for this? It is that what the ruler uses to command his subordinates is one thing, and what the subordinates use to serve their ruler is one safeguard. To illustrate with a parable: there is a high wall and a deep palace. The wall is erected with care, and a single gate is hewn at the top. If a thief enters, the gate is sealed behind him, and he is sought within—then the thief has no way to escape. What is the reason for this? The ruler has grasped the essential point.\n\nThus, in ancient times, the sage-kings governed by ranking virtue and esteeming worthiness. Even among farmers, artisans, and merchants, if one possessed ability, they would elevate him, grant him high rank, bestow upon him generous emolument, entrust him with affairs, and empower him to issue decrees. They declared: \"If rank is not exalted, the people will not revere it; if emolument is not ample, the people will not trust it; if decrees are not decisive, the people will not fear them.\" Conferring these three upon the enlightened was not to reward worthiness for its own sake, but to ensure the success of their undertakings.\n\nAt such times, one advanced in rank by virtue, served in office by duty, and was rewarded according to labor, with emolument apportioned by merit. Thus, no office was perpetually noble, nor were the people eternally base; those with ability were elevated, while those without were demoted. Public righteousness was upheld, and private resentments were set aside—this is what such words meant.\n\nThus, in ancient times, Yao elevated Shun from the southern banks of Fuze Marsh, entrusted him with governance, and the world was at peace. Yu elevated Yi from the midst of Yinfang, entrusted him with governance, and the Nine Provinces were completed. Tang elevated Yi Yin from the kitchen, entrusted him with governance, and his plans succeeded. King Wen elevated Hong Yao and Tai Dian from among the hunters, entrusted them with governance, and the western lands submitted. At such times, even those ministers in positions of generous emolument and exalted rank dared not act without reverence and caution, while even farmers, artisans, and merchants vied to encourage one another and esteem the intent.\n\nThus, the scholar-officials served as assistants and heirs to the succession. Therefore, when worthy men were obtained, plans were not thwarted, the ruler’s person was not wearied, reputation was established, meritorious deeds were made manifest, and evil did not arise—all because worthy men were obtained.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: \"In prosperity, worthy men cannot but be elevated; in adversity, worthy men cannot but be elevated.\" If one desires to follow the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, and the former kings, one cannot but esteem worthiness. For esteeming worthiness is the foundation of governance.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Esteeming Worthiness**\nMaster Mozi said: Now, the kings, dukes, and great men who rule the people, preside over the altars of soil and grain, and govern the state—if they wish to preserve and not lose their position, yet do not examine esteeming worthiness as the foundation of governance, how can this be known? It is said: When the noble and wise govern the foolish and base, there is order; when the foolish and base govern the noble and wise, there is chaos. Thus, it is known that esteeming worthiness is the foundation of governance.\n\nTherefore, the ancient sage-kings greatly honored and esteemed worthiness, employing the capable without partiality to fathers or elder brothers, without bias toward the noble or wealthy, and without favoritism for beauty. The worthy were elevated and placed above, enriched and ennobled, made officials and leaders. The unworthy were suppressed and dismissed, impoverished and debased, made subordinates and laborers. Thus, the people all encouraged one another with rewards, feared punishments, and followed one another in becoming worthy. With the worthy numerous and the unworthy few, this was called advancing worthiness.\n\nThen the sage listened to their words, observed their conduct, examined their abilities, and cautiously appointed them to office—this was called employing ability. Thus, those capable of governing the state were made to govern the state; those capable of leading offices were made to lead offices; those capable of governing towns were made to govern towns. All those employed to govern the state, offices, and towns were the state’s worthy men.\n\nWhen worthy men governed the state, they rose early and retired late, hearing lawsuits and administering governance—thus the state was well-ordered and penal laws were just. When worthy men led offices, they slept late and rose early, collecting the profits of passes, markets, mountains, forests, marshes, and weirs to fill the coffers—thus offices were well-supplied and wealth was not dissipated. When worthy men governed towns, they went out early and returned late, tilling the fields, planting crops, and gathering grain—thus grain was abundant and the people had enough to eat.\n\nTherefore, when the state was well-ordered, penal laws were just; when offices were well-supplied, the myriad people were enriched. Above, there was silk and wine for offering to Heaven and the spirits; externally, there were furs and silk for exchanging with the neighboring feudal lords. Internally, there was food to relieve hunger and rest the weary, nourishing the myriad people; externally, there was means to attract the worthy men of the world.\n\nThus, above, Heaven and the spirits enriched them; externally, the feudal lords allied with them; internally, the myriad people were close to them, and worthy men flocked to them. With this, planning affairs succeeded, undertaking tasks was accomplished, defending within was secure, and punishing without was strong. Therefore, it was only the former Three Dynasties’ sage-kings—Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—who thus reigned over the world and rectified the feudal lords, for this was their method.\n\nYet though it is said to follow this method, if one does not know the means to implement it, affairs will remain as if unaccomplished. Therefore, three fundamentals must be established. What are the three fundamentals? It is said: If rank is not exalted, the people will not revere it; if emolument is not ample, the people will not trust it; if decrees are not decisive, the people will not fear them.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings granted high rank, generous emolument, entrusted affairs, and empowered decrees. Was this to bestow gifts upon their ministers? No—it was to ensure the success of their undertakings.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says:\n*\"I tell you of cares and concerns,\nI teach you of the fragrant wine;\nWho can grasp heat\nWithout using cool water?\"*\nThis speaks of how the ancient rulers and feudal lords could not but hold fast to good heirs and assistants—it is like grasping heat without cool water to rinse the hands.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings, if they obtained worthy men, employed them, ennobled them with ranks, enfeoffed them with lands, and were never sated. The worthy men, if they obtained enlightened rulers, exhausted the strength of their four limbs to serve the ruler’s affairs and never wearied. If there was goodness and excellence, they attributed it to their superior. Thus, goodness and excellence resided above, while resentments and slander remained below; joy and delight were with the ruler, while sorrows and anxieties were with the ministers. Thus, the ancient sage-kings governed in this manner.\n\nNow, the kings, dukes, and great men also wish to emulate others in esteeming worthiness and employing ability to govern, granting high rank—but emolument does not follow.\n\nIf high rank is granted without emolument, the people will not trust it. They will say: \"This is not true affection for me—it is merely a pretense to make use of me.\" How could those used in pretense ever grow close to their superiors? Thus, the ancient kings declared: \"Those who feed on governance cannot share tasks with others; those who hoard wealth cannot share emolument with others.\" If tasks are not shared and emolument is not distributed, then how can the worthy of the world ever come to stand beside kings, dukes, and great men? If the worthy do not come to their side, then the unworthy will remain at their left and right. With the unworthy at their side, their praises will not rightly honor the worthy, and their punishments will not rightly chastise the violent. If kings, dukes, and great men govern their states and families by such means, then their rewards will not rightly honor the worthy, and their punishments will not rightly chastise the violent. If rewards do not rightly honor the worthy and punishments do not rightly chastise the violent, then the worthy will not be encouraged, and the violent will not be deterred. As a result, at home they will not be filial to their parents; abroad they will not respect their elders in the village. Their conduct will lack restraint, their comings and goings will lack measure, and men and women will lack distinction. If put in charge of offices, they will steal; if entrusted with defending cities, they will betray. When their lord faces peril, they will not die for him; when he goes into exile, they will not follow. If tasked with judging lawsuits, their rulings will be unjust; if tasked with dividing wealth, their distributions will be unequal. When consulted on affairs, their counsel will fail; when sent to carry out tasks, they will accomplish nothing. When defending within, their guard will not hold; when punishing without, their force will not prevail. Thus, even the violent kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—lost their states and overturned their altars precisely for this reason. Why? Because they illuminated small matters but failed to illuminate great ones.\n\nNow, when the lords and grandees cannot even make a single robe, they must rely on skilled artisans. When they cannot slaughter a single ox or sheep, they must rely on skilled butchers. Yet when it comes to these two matters, the lords and grandees do not yet know to employ the worthy and capable in governance. Only when their states fall into chaos and their altars face peril do they fail to employ the capable to bring order. Instead, they employ their relatives, or those who have suddenly grown rich and noble, or whose appearance is pleasing. But those who have suddenly grown rich and noble, or whose appearance is pleasing—are they necessarily wise and intelligent? If such are tasked with governing the state, then the state is entrusted to the unwise and unintelligent, and its descent into chaos is already foreseeable.\n\nMoreover, when the lords and grandees favor someone for their appearance and employ them without examining their wisdom, granting office out of affection, they place those who cannot govern a hundred in charge of a thousand, and those who cannot govern a thousand in charge of ten thousand. Why is this? It is said: those who hold office enjoy high rank and generous emoluments, so they are employed out of favoritism. Yet if one who cannot govern a thousand is placed in charge of ten thousand, the office is ten times greater. The principles of governance require daily attention; if the task grows tenfold but the effort does not, if the wisdom does not increase tenfold but the office does, then one part is governed while nine are abandoned. Even if one works day and night to manage such an office, it will remain ungoverned. Why is this? Because the lords and grandees do not understand that employing the worthy and capable is the foundation of governance.\n\nThus, those who govern by employing the worthy and capable achieve order, as I have said; those who govern by employing the inferior bring chaos, as I have also said. Now, if the lords and grandees truly wish to govern their states, to preserve and secure them without loss, why do they not examine the principle of employing the worthy as the foundation of governance?\n\nMoreover, is the principle of employing the worthy as the foundation of governance solely the teaching of Mozi? It is the Way of the sage-kings, the words of the former kings recorded in the *Ju Nian*, which states: \"Seek sagely rulers and wise men to assist and support you.\" The *Yang Shi* says: \"Diligently seek the most sagely, unite with them in strength and purpose to govern the world.\" These words show that sagacity is not lost when the worthy and capable are employed in governance.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of old were able to carefully employ the worthy and capable in governance, without admixture of other considerations, so that all under heaven found their proper place. In ancient times, Shun tilled the fields at Li Mountain, made pottery by the He River, and fished at Lei Marsh. Yao discovered him in the marshes of Fuze, raised him to the position of Son of Heaven, and entrusted him with the governance of the world and the rule of its people. Yi Zhi was a private servant to the daughter of the Youxin clan, personally serving as a cook. Tang discovered him and raised him to be his chief minister, entrusting him with the governance of the world and the rule of its people. Fu Yue wore coarse cloth and a hempen belt, laboring as a hired builder at Chuan Rock. Wu Ding discovered him and raised him to be one of the Three Dukes, entrusting him with the governance of the world and the rule of its people. Why did these men begin in lowliness and end in nobility, begin in poverty and end in wealth? Because the lords and grandees understood the principle of employing the worthy and capable in governance. Thus, the people suffered neither hunger without food, cold without clothing, toil without rest, nor chaos without order.\n\nTherefore, the ancient sage-kings carefully employed the worthy and capable in governance, taking the heavens as their model. Though the heavens make no distinction between rich and poor, noble and base, near and far, kin and stranger, they raise up and honor the worthy, while suppressing and dismissing the unworthy. Then who are those who, being rich and noble, were worthy and thus received reward? They are the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties: Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. And what reward did they receive? In governing the world, they universally loved and benefited the people, leading the myriad peoples to honor heaven, serve the spirits, and love and benefit all. Thus, heaven and the spirits rewarded them, establishing them as Sons of Heaven and fathers and mothers to the people. The myriad peoples praised them as sage-kings, and this praise continues to this day. These are the ones who, being rich and noble, were worthy and thus received reward.\n\nThen who are those who, being rich and noble, were violent and thus received punishment? They are the violent kings of the Three Dynasties: Jie, Zhou, You, and Li. How do we know this? In governing the world, they universally hated and despised the people, leading them to revile heaven and insult the spirits, to scorn and oppress the myriad peoples. Thus, heaven and the spirits punished them, causing them to die and be executed, their descendants scattered, their households destroyed, their posterity cut off. The myriad peoples condemned them as violent kings, and this condemnation continues to this day. These are the ones who, being rich and noble, were violent and thus received punishment.\n\nThen who are those who, though kin, were not good and thus received punishment? They are men like Gun, the eldest son of the Emperor, who was set aside for his lack of virtue and ultimately executed at the wilds of Yu. Even the scorching sun could not reach him, and the Emperor did not love him. These are the ones who, though kin, were not good and thus received punishment.\n\nThen who are those whom heaven employed for their ability? They are men like Yu, Ji, and Gao Yao. How do we know this? The former kings’ book *The Punishments of Lü* records: \"The August Emperor inquired of the lower people, and the Miao had a case. It said: 'The drought is due to the excesses below; brightness is not constant, and the widowed and orphaned are not covered.' Virtue’s might is mighty, virtue’s brightness is bright. Thus, the Three Lords were named to relieve the people’s toil. Bo Yi descended with the statutes, and the wise people maintained the punishments. Yu pacified the waters and earth, and named the mountains and rivers.\"\n\nJi excelled in sowing seeds, cultivating fine grains. The Three Lords accomplished their works, relying on the people. This speaks of the three sages: they were cautious in speech, prudent in conduct, refined in thought, and sought out the world’s hidden affairs and neglected benefits to serve heaven above—thus heaven turned toward their virtue. Below, they extended it to the myriad people, who received its benefits without end. Therefore, the former kings’ words say: This Dao, when broadly applied to the world, knows no exhaustion; when narrowly applied, it brings no distress. When cultivated and employed, the myriad people receive its benefits without end.\n\n*The Odes of Zhou* records: \"The sage’s virtue is as high as heaven, as vast as earth. Its illumination in the world is as firm as the earth, as steadfast as mountains. It does not split, does not collapse—like the sun’s light, like the moon’s brightness, constant as heaven and earth.\" This speaks of the sage’s virtue: resplendent, luminous, expansive, and enduring. Thus, the sage’s virtue encompasses heaven and earth.\n\nNow, if kings and lords wish to rule the world and govern the feudal lords, without virtue and righteousness, what will they rely upon? Their doctrine must surely grasp awe-inspiring might. Yet where will kings and lords obtain such awe-inspiring might? The people’s ruin is their death. The living desire life intensely, and death they detest above all. When what they desire is unattainable and what they detest arrives repeatedly, from ancient times to the present, none have been able to rule the world and govern the feudal lords by such means.\n\nNow, if lords wish to rule the world and govern the feudal lords, desiring their will to prevail in the world and their names to endure in later generations, they must first examine the foundation of exalting the worthy in governance. This is the profound practice of sages.\n\n**Exalting the Worthy, Part Ten**\nMaster Mozi said: The kings and lords of the world all desire their states to be prosperous, their people numerous, and their laws well-ordered. Yet they do not recognize that exalting the worthy in governance is the foundation for their states and people. The root error of kings and lords lies in neglecting this foundation. If kings and lords have indeed lost this foundation, can we not illustrate it with examples?\n\nSuppose there were a feudal lord governing his state who declared: \"All in my state who are skilled in archery and charioteering, I will reward and honor. Those unskilled in archery and charioteering, I will punish and degrade.\" Among the knights of his state, who would rejoice and who would fear? I believe the skilled would rejoice, and the unskilled would fear. By rewarding them, I would guide them, saying: \"All in my state who are loyal and trustworthy, I will reward and honor. Those disloyal and untrustworthy, I will punish and degrade.\" Among the knights of his state, who would rejoice and who would fear? I believe the loyal and trustworthy would rejoice, and the disloyal and untrustworthy would fear.\n\nNow, if one governs the state and people by exalting the worthy, it encourages the good and discourages the violent. Applied broadly to the world, it encourages the good and discourages the violent throughout. Why then did I formerly esteem the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu? Because they governed the people by facing the multitude, issuing policies that ordered the people, enabling the good in the world to be encouraged and the violent to be discouraged. Thus, exalting the worthy is identical to the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu.\n\nYet today, the scholar-officials of the world, in their dwellings and speech, all exalt the worthy. But when it comes to facing the multitude, issuing policies, and ordering the people, none know to exalt the worthy and employ the capable. From this, I know that the scholar-officials of the world perceive minor matters clearly but fail to grasp the greater ones. How do I know this?\n\nIf a king or lord possesses cattle and sheep but cannot slaughter them, he must seek a skilled butcher. If he has garments but cannot tailor them, he must seek a skilled artisan. In such matters, even if they have close kin—unexpectedly wealthy, noble, or fair of face—knowing they are incapable, they do not employ them. Why? They fear the ruin of their property.\n\nYet when it comes to their states, it is not so. Kings and lords appoint their close kin, the unexpectedly wealthy, noble, or fair of face. Thus, their concern for their states is not as great as their concern for a broken bow, a lame horse, garments, cattle, or sheep. From this, I know that the scholar-officials of the world are clear about minor matters but unclear about major ones. This is like employing the emaciated as envoys or the deaf as music masters.\n\nTherefore, when the ancient sage-kings governed the world, those they enriched and honored were not necessarily their close kin, the unexpectedly wealthy, noble, or fair of face. Thus, Shun plowed at Mount Li, made pottery by the riverbank, fished at Thunder Marsh, and burned shells at Changyang. Yao found him at the southern bank of Fuze and made him Son of Heaven, entrusting him with the world’s governance and the ordering of its people. Yi Yin was a servant to the daughter of the Xin clan and worked as a cook. Tang discovered and elevated him, making him one of the Three Dukes, entrusting him with the world’s governance and the ordering of its people.\n\nOnce, Fu Yue dwelled on an isle in the Northern Sea, upon barren soil, clad in coarse cloth with a rope for a belt. He labored as a hired mason, building the walls of Fu Rock. Wuding discovered and elevated him, making him one of the Three Dukes, entrusting him with the world’s governance and the ordering of its people.\n\nThus, when Yao elevated Shun, when Tang elevated Yi Yin, and when Wuding elevated Fu Yue, did they do so because they were close kin, unexpectedly wealthy, noble, or fair of face? They followed their words, employed their strategies, and practiced their Way—what benefited Heaven above, what benefited spirits in the middle, and what benefited the people below. For this reason, they were promoted and exalted.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings, having carefully esteemed worthies and wishing to employ them in governance, inscribed their deeds on bamboo and silk, carved them on basins and bowls, and transmitted them to later generations of descendants.\n\nIn the *Lü Xing* of the former kings’ writings, it is thus recorded: The king said, “Oh, come! You who possess states and lands, I declare to you the administration of justice. In the present age, to bring peace to the hundred clans, what words should you choose in selecting men? What reverence should you not apply to punishment? What measure should you not reach? If you can select men and reverently administer justice, the Way of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu may be attained.”\n\nWhy is this so? It is through esteeming worthies that such heights are reached.\n\nIn the writings of the former kings, the *Jian Nian* thus states: “Ah! The sagely and martial know men, employing them as screens and aids to their own persons.”\n\nThis speaks of how the former kings governed the world: they invariably selected the worthy to serve as their close ministers and assistants. It is said: Now, all the gentlemen and noble men under heaven desire wealth and honor while detesting poverty and lowliness. It is asked: How then may one attain wealth and honor and avoid poverty and lowliness? There is no better way than to become worthy. But how is the Way of becoming worthy to be pursued? It is said: Those with strength should swiftly assist others; those with wealth should generously share with others; those with the Dao should earnestly instruct others. Thus, the hungry will be fed, the cold clothed, and the disordered governed. If the hungry are fed, the cold clothed, and the disordered governed, this is the peace of all living things.\n\nYet today, the wealth and honor of kings, dukes, and great men are bestowed upon their own flesh and blood—those who, without cause, enjoy wealth and honor, whose faces are fair. Now, these kin of kings, dukes, and great men—those who, without cause, enjoy wealth and honor and whose faces are fair—how can they necessarily possess wisdom? If they lack wisdom and are tasked with governing their states, the disorder of those states may be foreseen.\n\nNow, all the gentlemen and noble men under heaven desire wealth and honor while detesting poverty and lowliness. How then may one attain wealth and honor and avoid poverty and lowliness? It is said: There is no better way than to become kin of kings, dukes, and great men—those who, without cause, enjoy wealth and honor and whose faces are fair. Yet this is not something that can be learned. Even if one lacks discernment, even if one’s virtue and conduct are as profound as those of Yu, Tang, Wen, or Wu, one will not thereby gain favor. Even if the kin of kings, dukes, and great men are deaf, blind, or crippled, even if they suddenly become like Jie or Zhou, they will not thereby lose favor.\n\nThus, when rewards do not correspond to worthiness and punishments do not correspond to wickedness, those who are rewarded are undeserving, and those who are punished are blameless. This causes the people to lose heart and scatter, to be discouraged from doing good. They withhold the strength of their limbs and do not labor for one another; they let their surplus wealth rot and do not share it; they conceal good teachings and do not instruct one another. Thus, the hungry are not fed, the cold are not clothed, and the disordered are not governed.\n\nExtending this upward, we see that in ancient times, Yao had Shun, Shun had Yu, Yu had Gao Yao, Tang had his humble minister, and King Wu had Hong Yao, Tai Dian, Nan Gong Kuo, and San Yi Sheng. Through them, the world was harmonized, and the common people flourished. Thus, those near were at peace, and those far away submitted. Wherever the sun and moon shone, wherever boats and carts reached, wherever rain and dew moistened, wherever grain nourished—all received this without need for exhortation or praise.\n\nNow, if the kings, dukes, great men, gentlemen, and noble men under heaven truly wish to practice benevolence and righteousness, to become the highest of men, to follow the Way of the sagely kings above and to bring benefit to their states and people below, they must not fail to examine this teaching on esteeming the worthy. For esteeming the worthy is the benefit of Heaven, the spirits, and the people, and the foundation of governance.\n\nMozi spoke, saying: In ancient times, when the people first came into being and there was yet no ordered government, their speech held divergent meanings. Thus, one person had one sense of right, two people had two senses, and ten people had ten senses. The more numerous the people, the more numerous their notions of right. Each person affirmed their own sense of right and rejected that of others, so they mutually condemned one another. Within, fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers, became resentful and hostile, scattering and unable to unite in harmony. The hundred clans of the world all harmed one another with water, fire, poison, and weapons. Even when they had surplus strength, they did not use it to aid one another; when they had excess wealth and skill, they did not share it; when they possessed good ways, they concealed them and did not teach them. The disorder of the world was like that of birds and beasts.\n\nNow, the reason the world fell into chaos was the absence of rulers and leaders. Therefore, the worthy and capable among the world were selected and established as the Son of Heaven. Once the Son of Heaven was established, considering his power insufficient, he further selected the worthy and capable of the world and appointed them as the Three Dukes. After the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes were established, given the vastness of the world, the distant lands and foreign peoples, and the myriad distinctions of right and wrong, benefit and harm, which could not be clearly known all at once, the world was divided into ten thousand states, and feudal lords were set up as rulers. Once the feudal lords were established, considering their power insufficient, they further selected the worthy and capable within their states and appointed them as local officials.\n\nWhen the officials were all in place, the Son of Heaven issued decrees to the hundred clans of the world, saying: \"When you hear of good or bad, you must report it to your superiors. What your superiors affirm, you must all affirm; what they reject, you must all reject. If your superiors err, admonish them; if your subordinates do good, recommend them. Those who align above and do not collude below—these are the ones the superiors reward and the people praise. But if you hear of good or bad and do not report it to your superiors, if you cannot affirm what your superiors affirm or reject what they reject, if you do not admonish their errors or recommend the good of your subordinates, if you collude below and do not align above—these are the ones the superiors punish and the people condemn.\" The superiors used this as the basis for rewards and punishments, making their scrutiny clear and trustworthy.\n\nThus, the village head was the virtuous person of the village. The village head issued decrees to the hundred clans of the village, saying: \"When you hear of good or bad, you must report it to the district head. What the district head affirms, you must all affirm; what he rejects, you must all reject. Abandon your improper words and learn the district head’s good words. Abandon your improper conduct and learn the district head’s good conduct. Then how could the district be disordered?\" Examining why the district was well-governed: the district head alone unified the sense of right in the district, and thus the district was governed.\n\nThe district head was the virtuous person of the district. The district head issued decrees to the hundred clans of the district, saying: \"When you hear of good or bad, you must report it to the feudal lord. What the feudal lord affirms, you must all affirm; what he rejects, you must all reject. Abandon your improper words and learn the feudal lord’s good words. Abandon your improper conduct and learn the feudal lord’s good conduct. Then how could the state be disordered?\" Examining why the state was well-governed: the feudal lord alone unified the sense of right in the state, and thus the state was governed.\n\nThe feudal lord was the virtuous person of the state. The feudal lord issued decrees to the hundred clans of the state, saying: \"When you hear of good or bad, you must report it to the Son of Heaven. What the Son of Heaven affirms, you must all affirm; what he rejects, you must all reject. Abandon your improper words and learn the Son of Heaven’s good words. Abandon your improper conduct and learn the Son of Heaven’s good conduct. Then how could the world be disordered?\" Examining why the world was well-governed: the Son of Heaven alone unified the sense of right in the world, and thus the world was governed.\n\nIf the hundred clans of the world all aligned above with the One in Heaven but did not align above with Heaven, the old disorder would not yet be gone. Now, when whirlwinds and bitter rains come ceaselessly, this is Heaven’s way of punishing the people for not aligning above with Heaven. Therefore, Mozi said: In ancient times, the sage-kings established the five punishments to govern their people, like the guiding threads of silk and the main ropes of nets, to restrain and gather the hundred clans of the world who did not align above with their superiors.\n\nMozi said: In the present age, reverting to the time when the people first came into being and had no rulers or leaders, their speech held divergent meanings. Thus, one person had one sense of right, ten people had ten senses, and a hundred people had a hundred senses. The more numerous the people, the more numerous their notions of right. Each person affirmed their own sense of right and rejected that of others, so they mutually condemned one another. Within, fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers, became resentful, all harboring thoughts of separation and unable to unite in harmony. Even when they had surplus strength, they did not use it to aid one another; when they possessed good ways, they concealed them and did not teach them; when they had excess wealth and skill, they did not share it. The disorder of the world was like that of birds and beasts. Without the norms of ruler and subject, superior and inferior, elder and younger, without the rites of father and son and elder and younger brother, the world fell into chaos.\n\nUnderstanding that the people had no rulers or leaders to unify the sense of right in the world, and thus the world was in chaos, they selected the worthy, good, sagely, wise, eloquent, and discerning among the world and established them as the Son of Heaven, to undertake the task of unifying the sense of right in the world. Once the Son of Heaven was established, considering that his own ears and eyes alone could not unify the sense of right in the world, he selected the assisting, examining, worthy, good, sagely, wise, eloquent, and discerning among the world and appointed them as the Three Dukes, to join in the task of unifying the sense of right in the world.\n\nThe Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes having been established, considering the vastness of the world and that the people of distant mountains and remote lands could not be uniformly governed, they divided the world and set up the lords of ten thousand feudal states, charging them with the task of unifying the sense of right within their domains. Once the feudal lords were established, considering that their own ears and eyes alone could not unify the sense of right within their states, they selected the worthy within their domains and appointed them as generals, ministers, and great officers, extending down to the heads of villages and hamlets, to join in the task of unifying the sense of right within their states. The rulers of the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords, the leaders of the people, were thus settled.\n\nThe Son of Heaven issued decrees and promulgated teachings, saying: \"Whenever one sees or hears of good, one must report it to one’s superior; whenever one sees or hears of wrong, one must likewise report it to one’s superior. What one’s superior approves, one must also approve; what one’s superior disapproves, one must also disapprove. If one has goodness, one should recommend it to one’s peers; if one’s superior has faults, one should admonish them. One should align with one’s superior in sense of right and harbor no intention of colluding with inferiors. Those whom the superior deems worthy shall be rewarded, and all the people, upon hearing of it, shall praise them. But if one sees or hears of good and does not report it to one’s superior, or sees or hears of wrong and likewise does not report it; if one cannot approve what one’s superior approves or disapprove what one’s superior disapproves; if one has goodness but does not recommend it to one’s peers, or if one’s superior has faults but one does not admonish them; if one colludes with inferiors to oppose one’s superior—those whom the superior deems guilty shall be punished, and all the people, upon hearing of it, shall condemn them.\"\n\nThus, the sage kings of antiquity in administering punishments, rewards, and commendations were most discerning and meticulous in their scrutiny, ensuring trustworthiness. As a result, all the people under heaven desired to obtain the rewards and commendations of their superiors and feared their censure and punishment. Therefore, the village heads followed the policies of the Son of Heaven and unified the sense of right within their villages. Once the village heads had unified the sense of right within their villages, they led the people of their villages to align with the heads of their townships, saying: \"All the people of the village must align with the township head and not dare to collude with inferiors. What the township head approves, they must also approve; what the township head disapproves, they must also disapprove. They must discard unwholesome speech and learn the wholesome speech of the township head; they must discard unwholesome conduct and learn the wholesome conduct of the township head. The township head is indeed the worthiest in the township. If all the people of the township model themselves after the township head, how could the township not be well-governed?\" Examining how the township head governs the township, by what means does he do so? It is said: \"Only by his ability to unify the sense of right within the township, and thus the township is well-governed.\"\n\nOnce the townships within the domain were well-governed, they led the people of their townships to align with the feudal lord, saying: \"All the people of the township must align with the feudal lord and not dare to collude with inferiors. What the feudal lord approves, they must also approve; what the feudal lord disapproves, they must also disapprove. They must discard unwholesome speech and learn the wholesome speech of the feudal lord; they must discard unwholesome conduct and learn the wholesome conduct of the feudal lord. The feudal lord is indeed the worthiest in the state. If all the people of the state model themselves after the feudal lord, how could the state not be well-governed?\" Examining how the feudal lord governs the state and achieves good governance, by what means does he do so? It is said: \"Only by his ability to unify the sense of right within the state, and thus the state is well-governed.\"\n\nOnce the feudal lord had governed his state and achieved good governance, he led the people of his state to align with the Son of Heaven, saying: \"All the people of the state must align with the Son of Heaven and not dare to collude with inferiors. What the Son of Heaven approves, they must also approve; what the Son of Heaven disapproves, they must also disapprove. They must discard unwholesome speech and learn the wholesome speech of the Son of Heaven; they must discard unwholesome conduct and learn the wholesome conduct of the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven is indeed the most benevolent person under heaven. If all the people under heaven model themselves after the Son of Heaven, how could the world not be well-governed?\" Examining how the Son of Heaven governs the world, by what means does he do so? It is said: \"Only by his ability to unify the sense of right under heaven, and thus the world is well-governed.\"\n\nYet if one aligns with the Son of Heaven but does not align with Heaven, then the calamities of Heaven will not cease. Thus, when Heaven sends unseasonable cold and heat, untimely snow, frost, rain, and dew, when the five grains do not ripen, the six livestock do not thrive, when plagues and epidemics, whirlwinds and bitter rains arrive in succession, these are the punishments sent down by Heaven to penalize those below who do not align with Heaven. Therefore, the sage kings of antiquity understood what Heaven and the spirits desired and avoided what Heaven and the spirits detested, seeking to promote the benefit of the world and eliminate its harm. Thus, they led the people under heaven to fast, bathe, and purify themselves, preparing clear wine, sweet liquor, and pure grain offerings to sacrifice to Heaven and the spirits. In serving the ghosts and spirits, they dared not be remiss in the purity of their wine, liquor, and grain offerings; they dared not offer lean or scrawny sacrificial animals; they dared not present jade tablets, silk, or cloth that did not meet the proper measures; they dared not miss the proper times for spring and autumn sacrifices; they dared not judge cases unjustly; they dared not distribute wealth unfairly; and they dared not be negligent in their dwellings.\n\nThey said: \"If the leaders are like this, then when they issue punishments and achieve victory, by what means do they do so?\" It is said: \"Only by governing through alignment with the superior.\" Thus, the sage kings of antiquity governed in this manner.\n\nNow, the people of the world say: \"In the present age, the blessings of Heaven and the spirits can be obtained. If one can vigorously pursue what is convenient and beneficial for the people, then the affection of the people can be won.\" Governing in this manner, when they plan affairs, their undertakings succeed; when they defend their territory, it is secure. Above, Heaven and the spirits bestow abundant favor upon their leaders; below, the people enjoy the convenience and benefit of their leaders. If Heaven and the spirits deeply favor them and they vigorously pursue their tasks, then the leaders under heaven will not yet have abandoned their roles, so why is it that the world is in chaos?\n\nMaster Mozi said: In the present age, the way of governing through rulers and leaders fundamentally differs from that of antiquity. It is like measuring with the five punishments. In former times, the sage kings established the five punishments to govern the world, yet when the Miao people later applied the five punishments, they threw the world into chaos. Was this because the punishments themselves were not good? No—it was because their use of punishments was not good. Thus, the ancient kings’ text *The Way of Punishments* states: \"The Miao people, in their perversity, twisted punishments into mutilation, creating the five deadly penalties, calling them 'the law.'\" This shows that those who use punishments well govern the people, while those who use them poorly turn them into instruments of slaughter. Was this because the punishments themselves were not good? No—it was because their use of punishments was not good, and so they became instruments of slaughter.\n\nThus, the ancient kings’ text *The Way of Decrees* states: \"The mouth can utter goodness or provoke war.\" This means that those who use speech well bring forth goodness, while those who use it poorly create slander, treachery, and strife. Was this because the mouth itself was not good? No—it was because their use of speech was not good, and so it became slander, treachery, and strife.\n\nTherefore, in antiquity, rulers and leaders were established to govern the people. They were like the guiding threads in silk or the main ropes in a fishing net, meant to mobilize the world, curb excess and violence, and unify its principles. Thus, the ancient kings’ text *The Way of Yearly Governance* states: \"When establishing states and founding capitals, they appointed kings, dukes, and lords. If they acted arrogantly, they were to be restrained; if high ministers and generals acted indolently, they were to be corrected. Only those skilled in governance were to equalize the world.\" This describes how the ancient gods and spirits established states, capitals, rulers, and leaders—not to elevate their ranks, enrich their emoluments, or grant them ease and luxury, but to enable them to promote benefit, eliminate harm, enrich the poor, aid the few, and bring order to danger and chaos. Thus did the sage kings of antiquity act.\n\nNow, the kings, dukes, and great officials of today administer punishments and governance in a manner contrary to this. They appoint as rulers and leaders those they find convenient, relying on their fathers, elder brothers, old friends, and trusted aides. The people know that those placed in positions of leadership are not truly fit to govern them, and so they all form cliques, conceal their actions, and refuse to align with their superiors. Thus, superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles. If superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles, then rewards and praise are insufficient to encourage goodness, and punishments and penalties are insufficient to deter violence.\n\nHow do we know this is so? Consider: if a ruler establishes governance in a state and appoints leaders for the people, saying, \"This person is worthy of reward; I will reward them,\" yet if superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles, then what the superior rewards, the multitude condemns. The people will say, \"This person lives among us, and we know them to be unworthy.\" Thus, even if they receive the superior’s reward, it is not enough to encourage goodness. Or if a ruler establishes governance in a state and appoints leaders for the people, saying, \"This person is worthy of punishment; I will punish them,\" yet if superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles, then what the superior punishes, the multitude praises. The people will say, \"This person lives among us, and we know them to be worthy.\" Thus, even if they receive the superior’s punishment, it is not enough to deter violence.\n\nIf a ruler establishes governance in a state and appoints leaders for the people, yet rewards and praise are insufficient to encourage goodness, and punishments and penalties are insufficient to deter violence, then is this not the same as the time before rulers and leaders existed, when people crouched in submission? If having rulers and leaders is no different from having none, then this is not the way to govern the people and unify the multitude.\n\nTherefore, the sage kings of antiquity used alignment with the superior as the principle for establishing rulers and leaders. In this way, the sentiments of superiors and inferiors were communicated without obstruction. If superiors had hidden affairs or overlooked benefits, inferiors could bring them to light and utilize them. If inferiors harbored grievances or accumulated harm, superiors could discover and eliminate them. Thus, even if someone thousands of miles away did good, though their household did not yet know and their village had not yet heard, the Son of Heaven could reward them. Even if someone thousands of miles away did evil, though their household did not yet know and their village had not yet heard, the Son of Heaven could punish them. As a result, all the people under heaven trembled in fear, dared not act with excess or violence, and said: \"The eyes and ears of the world are as if divine!\"\n\nThe words of the former kings state: \"It is not divine. It is simply that one can make the ears and eyes of others assist in seeing and hearing, make the mouths of others assist in speaking, make the minds of others assist in thinking, and make the limbs of others assist in acting. When many assist in seeing and hearing, what one perceives and knows extends far. When many assist in speaking, the reach of one’s virtuous influence is broad. When many assist in thinking, one’s plans and deliberations are swift and sound. When many assist in acting, one’s tasks are swiftly accomplished.\" Thus, the reason the sage kings of antiquity succeeded in their affairs, achieved their goals, and left their names to later generations was no other cause or strange circumstance—it was simply that they were able to govern through alignment with the superior.\n\nThus, the ancient kings’ text *The Odes of Zhou* states: \"They come to see their king, seeking his standards.\" This describes how the feudal lords of antiquity, in spring and autumn, came to the court of the Son of Heaven to receive his stern teachings. Returning to govern their states, wherever their governance extended, none dared disobey. At that time, there was fundamentally no one who dared to disrupt the Son of Heaven’s teachings. The *Odes* says:\n*\"My horses are black-maned,\nThe six reins smooth and supple.\nWe gallop and drive,\nEverywhere seeking counsel and deliberation.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"My horses are fine steeds,\nThe six reins like silk.\nWe gallop and drive,\nEverywhere seeking plans and strategies.\"*\nThis is what it means.\n\nIn antiquity, when the feudal lords heard of good or evil, they galloped to report it to the Son of Heaven. Thus, rewards befitted the worthy, punishments befitted the violent, the innocent were not killed, and the guilty were not spared. This was the achievement of alignment with the superior.\n\nThus Master Mozi declared: Now, the kings, dukes, grandees, and gentlemen of the world—if they truly wish to enrich their states, multiply their people, order their penal governance, and secure their altars of soil and grain—they must examine with utmost care this principle of *shangtong* (alignment with the superior), for it is the very foundation.\n\n*Shangtong, Part Thirteen*\nMaster Mozi stated: The task of the wise is necessarily this—to deliberate on what brings order to the state and its people and act accordingly, and to deliberate on what brings chaos to the state and its people and avoid it.\n\nNow, what brings order to the state and its people? When those above in governance obtain the true sentiments of those below, there is order; when they do not, there is chaos. How do we know this is so? When those above in governance obtain the true sentiments of those below, they thereby clarify for the people what is good and what is not. If they truly clarify for the people what is good and what is not, then they can reward the good and punish the violent. When the good are rewarded and the violent are punished, the state is necessarily ordered. When those above in governance do not obtain the true sentiments of those below, they thereby fail to clarify for the people what is good and what is not. If they truly fail to clarify for the people what is good and what is not, then they cannot reward the good or punish the violent. When the good are not rewarded and the violent are not punished, governance in this manner will inevitably plunge the multitude into chaos. Thus, the failure to obtain the true sentiments of those below is something that cannot but be examined.\n\nNow, how can one obtain the true sentiments of those below? Master Mozi said: Only by governing through *shangtong* and unifying the standard can this be achieved. How do we know that *shangtong* and unifying the standard can govern the world? Why not carefully examine the governance of antiquity? In ancient times, when Heaven first brought forth the people, there were no rulers or leaders, and the hundred clans acted as individuals. If the hundred clans acted as individuals, then one person had one standard, ten people had ten standards, a hundred people had a hundred standards, a thousand people had a thousand standards—extending to the point where the multitude of people could not be counted, and thus their so-called standards could not be counted either. Each regarded their own standard as right and others’ standards as wrong, leading to those with strength causing harm and those with lesser strength engaging in strife. Therefore, the world desired to unify the world’s standard. Thus, they selected the worthy and established them as the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven, considering his knowledge and strength insufficient to govern the world alone, selected the next best and established them as the Three Dukes. The Three Dukes, considering their knowledge and strength insufficient to assist the Son of Heaven alone, divided the land and enfeoffed the feudal lords. The feudal lords, considering their knowledge and strength insufficient to govern their territories alone, selected the next best and established them as ministers and stewards. The ministers and stewards, considering their knowledge and strength insufficient to assist their lords alone, selected the next best and established them as village chiefs and household heads. Thus, in ancient times, the Son of Heaven established the Three Dukes, and the feudal lords, ministers, stewards, village chiefs, and household heads were not chosen merely for their wealth, nobility, or leisure, but to assist in ordering governance and penal affairs. Therefore, in ancient times, when establishing states and founding capitals, they set up kings, dukes, and lords, and appointed ministers, officers, and leaders—not to indulge in pleasure, but to distinguish right from wrong and assist in governance and illumination.\n\nNow, why is it that those above cannot govern those below, and those below cannot serve those above? It is because superiors and inferiors disdain one another. Why is this so? Because their standards differ. If those with differing standards form factions, and the superior regards someone as good, others will slander them. If that person only seeks the superior’s reward and avoids the people’s slander, then those who do good will not necessarily be encouraged, for they see the reward. If the superior regards someone as violent, they will punish them, but that person may only receive the superior’s punishment while harboring the people’s praise. Thus, the violent will not necessarily be deterred, for they see the punishment. Therefore, the superior’s rewards and praise are insufficient to encourage the good, and their slander and punishment are insufficient to deter the violent. Why is this so? Because the desire to unify the world’s standard—how can this be achieved?\n\nThus Master Mozi said: Why not have the household heads test this by issuing decrees and proclamations to their households, saying: \"If you see anyone who loves and benefits the household, you must report it; if you see anyone who harms and plunders the household, you must also report it.\" If someone reports one who loves and benefits the household, they are like one who loves and benefits the household. The superior will reward them, and the multitude will praise them. If someone sees one who harms and plunders the household but does not report it, they are like one who harms and plunders the household. The superior will punish them, and the multitude will condemn them. Thus, all within the household will desire to obtain their superiors’ rewards and praise and avoid their slander and punishment. Therefore, when good words are spoken, the household head can reward the good and punish the violent. When the good are rewarded and the violent are punished, the household is necessarily ordered. Now, what brings order to the household? It is solely through governing by *shangtong* and unifying the standard.\n\nYet, if the way to order a household is entirely this, does it suffice for the state? It does not. The households in the world are exceedingly numerous, each regarding their own household as right and others’ households as wrong, leading to those with strength causing chaos and those with lesser strength engaging in strife. Therefore, the household heads are further made to gather their households and align with the feudal lord. The feudal lord also issues decrees and proclamations to the multitude of the state, saying: \"If you see anyone who loves and benefits the state, you must report it; if you see anyone who harms and plunders the state, you must also report it. If someone reports one who loves and benefits the state, they are like one who loves and benefits the state. The superior will reward them, and the multitude will praise them.\"\n\nIf one sees those who harm and plunder the state yet fails to report them, they are like those who harm and plunder the state. The superior will punish them, and the multitude will condemn them. Thus, all people in the state desire to obtain the rewards and praise of their superiors while avoiding blame and punishment. Therefore, when the people see good, they speak of it; when they see evil, they speak of it. The feudal lord rewards the good and punishes the violent. When the good are rewarded and the violent are punished, the state will surely be well-governed. Yet, considering why the state is well-governed, what is the reason? It is solely because governance is conducted through aligning with the One Dao/Way.\n\nNow that the state is well-governed, does it suffice for the world? It does not. The states in the world are exceedingly numerous, each regarding their own state as right and others’ states as wrong, leading to those with strength waging war and those with lesser strength engaging in strife. Therefore, the feudal lords are further made to select the righteousness of their states and align with the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven also issues decrees and proclamations to the multitude of the world, saying: \"If you see anyone who loves and benefits the world, you must report it; if you see anyone who harms and plunders the world, you must also report it. If someone reports one who loves and benefits the world, they are like one who loves and benefits the world. The superior will reward them, and the multitude will praise them. If one sees those who harm and plunder the world yet fails to report them, they are like those who harm and plunder the world. The superior will punish them, and the multitude will condemn them.\" Thus, all people in the world desire to obtain the rewards and praise of their superiors while avoiding blame and punishment. Therefore, they report both the good and the evil they see. The Son of Heaven rewards the good and punishes the violent. When the good are rewarded and the violent are punished, the world will surely be well-governed. Yet, considering why the world is well-governed, what is the reason? It is solely because governance is conducted through aligning with the One Dao/Way.\n\nNow that the world is well-governed, the Son of Heaven further gathers the righteousness of the world to align with Heaven. Thus, in the doctrine of aligning with the superior, the Son of Heaven who aligns with the One Dao/Way can govern the world. When applied to the feudal lords, it can govern their states; when applied to household heads, it can govern their households. Therefore, when used on a grand scale, it governs the world without deficiency; when used on a small scale, it governs a state or a household without excess. This is what is meant by the Dao/Way. Hence it is said: governing the states of the world is like governing a single household; commanding the people of the world is like commanding a single man.\n\nIs this idea unique to Master Mozi, while the former kings lacked it? It is not so. The sage-kings all governed by aligning with the One Dao/Way, and thus the world was well-governed. How do we know this is so? In the books of the former kings, the *Great Declaration* states: \"When petty men see deceit and craftiness yet do not report it, the punishment is equal.\" This means that those who see depravity and perversion yet fail to report it bear the same guilt as the depraved and perverse. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity governed the world by selecting those of excellence to assist them as their wings, and those outside who aided their vision and hearing were many. Therefore, when consulting with others on matters, they were the first to understand; when undertaking tasks with others, they were the first to accomplish them. Their virtuous reputation and fame preceded others. They trusted themselves and acted accordingly, thus reaping such benefits.\n\nThere is an ancient saying: \"One eye’s vision does not compare to two eyes’ vision; one ear’s hearing does not compare to two ears’ hearing; one hand’s grasp does not compare to two hands’ strength.\" Only by trusting oneself and acting accordingly can such benefits be attained. Thus, when the sage-kings of antiquity governed the world, if there was a worthy person a thousand *li* away, though the people of their village had not equally heard or seen them, the sage-king would reward them. If there was a violent person within a thousand *li*, though the people of their village had not equally seen them, the sage-king would punish them. Therefore, do not assume the sage-king had ears sharp and eyes bright—how could they see clearly to a thousand *li* away with a single glance or hear clearly to a thousand *li* away with a single listening? The sage-king did not go to see nor approach to hear. Yet, why were those who caused chaos, rebellion, theft, and banditry throughout the world left with no place to stand? It was because their governance through aligning with the One Dao/Way was excellent.\n\nThus, Master Mozi said: \"In general, when making the people align with the One Dao/Way, if one does not love the people urgently, the people cannot be employed. It must be said: one must urgently love and employ them, establish trust and uphold it. Lead them with wealth and honor, and guide them with clear punishments. When governance is like this, even those who do not wish to align with me will find it impossible.\"\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: \"Now, the kings, dukes, great officials, and gentlemen of the world, if in their hearts they desire to practice benevolence and righteousness, seek to be scholars, aspire to the Dao/Way of the sages above, and benefit the states and the hundred clans below, they must examine the doctrine of aligning with the superior and recognize that aligning with the One Dao/Way is the foundation and essential method of governance.\"\n\n*End of Scroll Three of Mozi*\n\nIf one earnestly attends to what the heavenly spirits deeply favor, then the blessings of the heavenly spirits may be obtained. If one earnestly attends to what benefits the myriad people, then the affection of the myriad people may be obtained. When governance is like this, plans succeed, undertakings are accomplished, defenses are secure, and punitive expeditions prevail.\n\nOne asks: \"For what reason is this so?\"\nIt is replied: \"Only by employing alignment with the superior in governance.\"\n\nThus did the sage-kings of antiquity govern in this manner.\n\nNow, the people of the world say: \"In the present age, the proper leaders of the world have not yet been abolished.\"\n\nThe sage who takes governing the world as their duty must know from where disorder arises, only then can they govern it; without knowing from where disorder arises, they cannot govern. This is like a physician who treats a person’s illness: they must know from where the illness arises, only then can they treat it; without knowing from where the illness arises, they cannot treat it. How is governing disorder any different? One must know from where disorder arises, only then can they govern it; without knowing from where disorder arises, they cannot govern it. The sage who takes governing the world as their duty cannot but examine from where disorder arises.\n\nWhere, then, does disorder arise? It arises from lack of mutual love. When ministers and children are not filial to their lords and fathers, this is called disorder. A child loves only themselves and not their father, thus they harm their father to benefit themselves; a younger brother loves only themselves and not their elder brother, thus they harm their elder brother to benefit themselves; a minister loves only themselves and not their lord, thus they harm their lord to benefit themselves. This is what is called disorder. Even when a father is not kind to their child, an elder brother is not kind to their younger brother, or a lord is not kind to their minister, this is also what the world calls disorder. A father loves only themselves and not their child, thus they harm their child to benefit themselves; an elder brother loves only themselves and not their younger brother, thus they harm their younger brother to benefit themselves; a lord loves only themselves and not their minister, thus they harm their minister to benefit themselves. Why is this? It all arises from lack of mutual love.\n\nEven the thieves and bandits of the world are the same. A thief loves only their own household and not another’s, thus they steal from another’s household to benefit their own; a bandit loves only their own body and not others, thus they harm others to benefit themselves. Why is this? It all stems from lack of mutual love. Even the great officers who bring disorder to other households and the feudal lords who attack other states are the same. Each great officer loves only their own household and not another’s, thus they bring disorder to another’s household to benefit their own; each feudal lord loves only their own state and not another’s, thus they attack another’s state to benefit their own. All the disorders of the world are encompassed in this. From where do they arise? They all arise from lack of mutual love.\n\nIf the world were to practice universal mutual love, and each person loved others as they love themselves, how could there be those who are unfilial or unkind? If one regarded children, younger brothers, and ministers as oneself, how could there be those who are unkind or unfilial? If one regarded another’s household as their own, who would steal? If one regarded another’s body as their own, who would harm? Thus, there would be no thieves or bandits. How could there be great officers bringing disorder to other households or feudal lords attacking other states? If one regarded another’s household as their own, who would bring disorder? If one regarded another’s state as their own, who would attack? Thus, there would be no great officers bringing disorder to other households or feudal lords attacking other states.\n\nIf the world were to practice universal mutual love, states would not attack one another, households would not bring disorder to one another, there would be no thieves or bandits, and lords, ministers, fathers, and children would all be filial and kind. In this way, the world would be well-governed. Therefore, the sage who takes governing the world as their duty cannot but prohibit hatred and encourage love. Thus, when the world practices universal mutual love, it is well-governed; when it practices mutual hatred, it falls into disorder. Therefore, Master Mozi said: \"One cannot but encourage loving others.\" This is the reason.\n\n**Universal Love, Part Two**\n\nMaster Mozi said: The humane person’s duty is to promote what benefits the world and eliminate what harms it. This is their duty. What, then, are the benefits of the world? What are its harms?\n\nMaster Mozi said: When states attack one another, households usurp one another, people harm one another, lords and ministers are not kind and loyal, fathers and children are not kind and filial, and elder and younger brothers are not harmonious, these are the harms of the world. Why, then, do these harms arise? Do they arise from lack of mutual love?\n\nMaster Mozi said: They arise from lack of mutual love. Now, feudal lords love only their own states and not others’, thus they do not hesitate to mobilize their states to attack others’; household heads love only their own households and not others’, thus they do not hesitate to mobilize their households to usurp others’; people love only their own bodies and not others’, thus they do not hesitate to harm others to benefit themselves. Therefore, when feudal lords do not love one another, they inevitably engage in open warfare; when household heads do not love one another, they inevitably usurp one another; when people do not love one another, they inevitably harm one another. When lords and ministers do not love one another, they are not kind and loyal; when fathers and children do not love one another, they are not kind and filial; when elder and younger brothers do not love one another, they are not harmonious. When the people of the world do not love one another, the strong will overpower the weak, the rich will insult the poor, the noble will disdain the lowly, and the cunning will deceive the foolish. All the disasters, usurpations, grudges, and resentments of the world arise from lack of mutual love. Therefore, the humane person condemns this.\n\nHaving condemned it, how should it be changed?\n\nMaster Mozi said: It should be changed through the principle of universal mutual love and mutual benefit. How, then, should the principle of universal mutual love and mutual benefit be practiced?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Regard another’s state as one’s own, regard another’s household as one’s own, regard another’s body as one’s own. Thus, when feudal lords love one another, they will not engage in open warfare; when household heads love one another, they will not usurp one another; when people love one another, they will not harm one another. The noble will not disdain the lowly, the cunning will not deceive the foolish, and all the disasters, usurpations, grudges, and resentments of the world can be prevented. The humane person praises this.\n\nThus, when lords and ministers love one another, they are kind and loyal; when fathers and children love one another, they are kind and filial; when elder and younger brothers love one another, they are harmonious. When the people of the world all love one another, the strong will not overpower the weak, the many will not oppress the few, the rich will not insult the poor.\n\nMaster Mozi said: Indeed, universal love would be excellent. Yet the difficulty lies in the world’s attachment to old ways. Master Mozi declared: The scholars and gentlemen of the world simply fail to recognize its benefit or discern its cause.\n\nConsider how governing cities and waging wars—even sacrificing one’s life for fame—are tasks the common people find most arduous. Yet if the ruler delights in them, his officers and masses will readily perform them. How much more so with mutual love and mutual benefit, which differ from these? For one who loves others will surely be loved in return; one who benefits others will surely be benefited in return. One who hates others will surely be hated in return; one who harms others will surely be harmed in return. What difficulty could there be? The obstacle lies only in the fact that superiors do not govern by it, and scholars do not practice it.\n\nIn former times, Duke Wen of Jin favored his officers’ coarse attire. Thus, Duke Wen’s ministers all wore robes of coarse wool bound with leather belts, and caps of bleached silk. They wore these when entering to see their lord and when attending court. Why was this so? Because the ruler delighted in it, his ministers followed suit.\n\nIn former times, King Ling of Chu favored his officers’ slender waists. Thus, King Ling’s ministers all restricted themselves to one meal a day, held their breath to tighten their belts, and leaned against walls to rise. Within a year, the court was filled with those pale from starvation. Why was this so? Because the ruler delighted in it, his ministers were able to do it.\n\nIn former times, King Goujian of Yue favored his officers’ courage. He trained and harmonized his ministers, then set fire to a boat and tested his warriors, saying: “All the treasures of Yue are here!” King Goujian personally drummed to urge his men forward. Hearing the drumbeat, they charged in disarray, trampling the flames to their deaths—over a hundred on either side. Then the king sounded the gong to withdraw.\n\nThus Master Mozi said: To eat little, wear coarse clothes, or sacrifice one’s life for fame—these are things the common people of the world all find difficult. Yet if the ruler delights in them, the masses can do them. How different is this from mutual love and mutual benefit! For one who loves others will surely be loved in return; one who benefits others will surely be benefited in return. One who hates others will surely be hated in return; one who harms others will surely be harmed in return. What difficulty could there be? The obstacle lies only in the fact that superiors do not govern by it, and scholars do not practice it.\n\nYet today, the gentlemen of the world say: “Indeed, mutual love would be excellent. However, it is an impracticable thing—like lifting Mount Tai to leap across the Yellow River.” Master Mozi said: This is not a proper analogy. To lift Mount Tai and leap across the Yellow River would require exhausting all one’s strength, and from ancient times to the present, no one has ever been able to do it. But mutual love and mutual benefit are different. The ancient sage-kings practiced them.\n\nHow do we know this? In ancient times, Yu governed the world. To the west, he opened the Western River and Yu Bao to drain the waters of Qu, Sun, and Huang. To the north, he built the Fang, Yuan, Zhuo, and Zhu embankments, the rear chambers of Hou, and the sluices of Xue Pool. He drilled through Dizhu and carved out Dragon Gate to benefit the people of Yan, Dai, Hu, Mo, and the Western River. To the east, he drained the marshes of Lu and built dikes at Zhuo Ze, dredging the Nine Channels to guide the waters of the eastern lands and benefit the people of Ji Province. To the south, he channeled the Jiang, Han, Huai, and Ru rivers eastward, directing them into the Five Lakes to benefit the people of Chu, Jing, Yue, and the southern tribes. This was Yu’s work, and it is what I now call mutual benefit.\n\nIn former times, King Wen governed the western lands. Like the sun and moon, his radiance shone in all four directions and throughout the western lands. He did not allow large states to bully small states, the multitude to oppress the orphaned and widowed, or the violent and powerful to seize the millet, grain, dogs, and pigs of the tillers. Heaven looked down with favor upon King Wen’s compassion. Thus, the elderly without children found care to live out their years; the lonely without brothers found companionship among the living; and the young who had lost their parents found support to grow up. This was King Wen’s work, and it is what I now call mutual love.\n\nIn former times, King Wu was about to perform the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai. In the *Annals*, it is recorded: “O Mount Tai! The virtuous descendant of Zhou, the king, has come to perform the great sacrifice. The great affair accomplished, the benevolent still act to reverently serve the Shang, Xia, Man, Yi, and Mo tribes. Though he had kinsmen of Zhou, they were not like the benevolent. If the myriad regions bore guilt, it would rest with me alone.” This was King Wu’s work, and it is what I now call mutual love.\n\nThus Master Mozi said: Today, the gentlemen of the world sincerely desire the scholars to be wealthy and hate their poverty; they desire the world to be well-governed and hate its chaos. They should practice mutual love and mutual benefit. This is the method of the sage-kings and the Way to govern the world. It cannot but be diligently pursued.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Universal Love (Part II)**\n\nMaster Mozi said: The task of the benevolent is necessarily to seek what benefits the world and remove what harms it. Now, in the present age, what is the greatest harm in the world? It is when large states attack small states, great families disrupt small families, the strong plunder the weak, the many oppress the few, the cunning deceive the foolish, and the noble arrogantly despise the humble. These are the harms of the world. Moreover, rulers who are not kind, ministers who are not loyal, fathers who are not compassionate, and sons who are not filial—these are also harms of the world. Furthermore, when people today despise others, wielding blades, poison, water, and fire to mutually injure and kill—these are also harms of the world.\n\nLet us trace the origin of these many harms. Where do they come from? Do they arise from loving and benefiting others? It must be said: No, they arise from hating and harming others. Now, when we distinguish the names in the world—those who hate and harm others—is this universal or partial? It must be partial. Yet this partiality is precisely what gives rise to the world’s great harms. Therefore, partiality is wrong.\n\nMaster Mozi said: To reject something, there must be something to replace it. If one rejects something without offering a replacement, it is like using water to put out fire—such an argument will surely fail. Thus Master Mozi said: Universal love must replace partiality.\n\nWhy can universal love replace partiality? Suppose one treats another’s state as one’s own. Who would then raise their state to attack another’s? Treating it as one’s own, one would act for the other as for oneself. Suppose one treats another’s capital as one’s own. Who would then raise their capital to assault another’s? Treating it as one’s own, one would act for the other as for oneself. Suppose one treats another’s family as one’s own. Who would then raise their family to disrupt another’s? Treating it as one’s own, one would act for the other as for oneself.\n\nNow, if states and capitals do not attack one another, and households do not disrupt or harm one another—is this a harm to the world or a benefit? It must be said: a benefit to the world. Let us trace back to the origin of all benefits. From where do they arise? Do they arise from hating and harming others? It must be said: no. They must arise from loving and benefiting others. When we distinguish the names throughout the world, is it partiality or universality that loves and benefits others? It must be said: universality. Thus, when universality is practiced in interaction, does it indeed give rise to the greatest benefit in the world? Therefore, Master Mozi said: universality is right.\n\nMoreover, I previously stated: the task of the humane person is necessarily to strive to promote the world’s benefits and eliminate its harms. Now, tracing back to the origin, we see that universality gives rise to the world’s greatest benefits, while partiality gives rise to its greatest harms. Therefore, Master Mozi said: partiality is wrong and universality is right—they differ as clearly as square and round.\n\nNow, I will rightly seek and obtain the world’s benefits, taking universality as the standard. Thus, ears and eyes assist one another in seeing and hearing, limbs are fully strong to act and serve, and those with the Dao freely instruct one another. Therefore, the elderly without wives or children have support to complete their years, and the young, weak, and orphaned without parents have refuge to grow to maturity. Now, if only universality is taken as the standard, such are its benefits.\n\nYet why do all under heaven, upon hearing of universality, oppose it? What is the reason for this? Nevertheless, the scholars of the world who criticize the words of universality have not ceased. They say: it is good, but can it truly be implemented? Master Mozi said: if it is implemented yet deemed impossible, this too would be a criticism. Moreover, where is there goodness that cannot be implemented?\n\nLet us tentatively advance two men and compare them. Suppose one man holds to partiality and the other to universality. The partial man says: how can I treat my friend’s body as my own, or my friend’s kin as my own kin? Thus, when he retreats and observes his friend, if the friend is hungry, he does not feed him; if cold, he does not clothe him; if ill or diseased, he does not attend to him; if dead, he does not bury him. Such are the words and deeds of the partial man.\n\nThe universal man’s words are not so, nor are his deeds. He says: I have heard that to be a noble man in the world, one must treat one’s friend’s body as one’s own and one’s friend’s kin as one’s own kin—only then can one be a noble man in the world. Thus, when he retreats and observes his friend, if the friend is hungry, he feeds him; if cold, he clothes him; if ill or diseased, he attends to him; if dead, he buries him. Such are the aspirations and deeds of the universal man.\n\nNow, between these two, are their words opposed and their deeds contrary? If we make these two men keep their word and act resolutely, so that their words and deeds align like tallying tokens, with no word left unfulfilled—then let me ask: suppose there is a vast plain here, and one dons armor and helmet to go forth, not knowing whether life or death awaits. Or suppose a lord’s minister is sent on a distant mission to Ba, Yue, Qi, or Jing, and it is uncertain whether he will return or not. Let me ask: in such cases, to whom would one entrust one’s household, support one’s kin, and entrust one’s wife and children? Would one entrust them to the universal man or the partial man? I believe that in such a situation, even the foolish men and women of the world, though not universal themselves, would necessarily entrust them to the universal man. If this is so, then to speak against universality while choosing it in practice is to acknowledge its worth.\n\nYet why do the scholars of the world, upon hearing of universality, still oppose it? Their criticism has not ceased. They say: perhaps one can choose men, but one cannot choose rulers. Let us tentatively advance two rulers and compare them. Suppose one ruler holds to universality and the other to partiality. The partial ruler says: how can I treat the bodies of my myriad people as my own? This is far from the sentiment of the world. Human life upon the earth is but a brief moment—like a team of four horses galloping past a crack. Thus, when he retreats and observes his myriad people, if they are hungry, he does not feed them; if cold, he does not clothe them; if ill or diseased, he does not attend to them; if dead, he does not bury them. Such are the words and deeds of the partial ruler.\n\nThe universal ruler’s words are not so, nor are his deeds. He says: I have heard that to be an enlightened ruler in the world, one must first treat the bodies of the myriad people as one’s own, and only afterward attend to oneself—only then can one be an enlightened ruler in the world. Thus, when he retreats and observes his myriad people, if they are hungry, he feeds them; if cold, he clothes them; if ill or diseased, he attends to them; if dead, he buries them. Such are the words and deeds of the universal ruler.\n\nNow, between these two rulers, are their words opposed and their deeds contrary? If we make these two rulers keep their word and act resolutely, so that their words and deeds align like tallying tokens, with no word left unfulfilled—then let me ask: suppose in this year there is a plague, and the myriad people suffer hardship, cold, and hunger, with many dying and their bodies filling the ditches. Between these two rulers, whom would one follow? I believe that in such a situation, even the foolish men and women of the world, though not universal rulers themselves, would necessarily follow the universal ruler.\n\nTo speak yet not embrace universality is to choose words and deeds that contradict. Yet why is it that all under heaven hear of universality only to reject it? Nevertheless, the scholars of the world who oppose universality have not ceased, saying: \"Universality is indeed benevolence and righteousness. Yet how can it be practiced?\" I compare the impracticability of universality to lifting Mount Tai and leaping over the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. Thus, universality is but a wish—how could it be a realizable thing?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Lifting Mount Tai to leap over the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers—from ancient times to the present, since the birth of humankind, this has never been done. Yet as for mutual love and mutual benefit, the former sage-kings—the Six Kings—personally practiced them. How do we know the former sage-kings personally practiced them? Master Mozi said: I did not exist in the same era or time as they, nor did I personally hear their voices or see their faces. I know this from what they inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, engraved on basins and bowls, and transmitted to later generations.\n\n*The Great Declaration* says: \"King Wen was like the sun and moon shining together, illuminating the four directions and the western lands.\" These words describe King Wen’s universal love for all under heaven, vast and boundless—like the sun and moon illuminating the world without partiality. Thus, King Wen practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks takes its model from King Wen.\n\nMoreover, not only *The Great Declaration* speaks thus; even *Yu’s Oath* is the same. Yu said: \"All you assembled multitudes, heed my words. It is not that I, this humble one, dare to act with reckless disorder. The Miao people are foolish and rebellious, and thus I carry out Heaven’s punishment. As I have led you to battle the drought and march against the Miao...\" Yu’s campaign against the Miao was not to seek greater wealth or honor, nor to indulge his ears and eyes, but to promote the benefit of all under heaven and eliminate its harms. Thus, Yu practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks seeks its model in Yu.\n\nFurthermore, not only the oaths and commands are thus; even *Tang’s Address* is the same. Tang said: \"I, this humble Lü, dare to offer a black bull and declare to the Supreme Lord and Sovereign Above: Now there is a great drought, and it is I who bear the blame. I do not dare to conceal goodness nor pardon faults; it is all recorded in the Emperor’s heart. If the myriad regions have faults, let them be upon me. If I have faults, let them not extend to the myriad regions.\" These words show that Tang, though noble as Son of Heaven and wealthy as lord of all under heaven, did not shrink from offering himself as a sacrifice to pray to the Supreme Lord and spirits. Thus, Tang practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks takes its model from Tang.\n\nMoreover, not only the oaths, commands, and Tang’s address are thus; even the *Zhou Poems* are the same. The *Zhou Poems* say:\n\"The kingly Way is vast and boundless,\nImpartial and without faction.\nThe kingly Way is level and smooth,\nWithout faction or partiality.\nStraight as an arrow, smooth as a whetstone,\nWhat the noble man treads, what the petty man beholds.\"\nDo my words not speak of the Way? In ancient times, Kings Wen and Wu upheld justice, equally rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent, without favoring kin or brothers. Thus, Wen and Wu practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks takes its model from Wen and Wu.\n\nYet why is it that all under heaven hear of universality only to reject it? Nevertheless, those who oppose universality have not ceased, saying: \"Does this not harm the interests of one’s parents and thus fail to be filial?\" Master Mozi said: Let us examine the considerations of a filial son who plans for his parents. Do I not know whether a filial son, in planning for his parents, wishes others to love and benefit them, or to hate and harm them? Judging by reason, he must wish others to love and benefit them. Then how should I first act to achieve this? If I first act to love and benefit others’ parents, will they then repay me by loving and benefiting mine? Or if I first act to hate others’ parents, will they then repay me by loving and benefiting mine? It must be that I first act to love and benefit others’ parents, and then they will repay me by loving and benefiting mine. Thus, the exchange of filial sons is indeed unavoidable. Should we not first act to love and benefit others’ parents? Or do we consider the filial sons of the world to be misguided and insufficient as a standard?\n\nLet us examine what the former kings recorded in the *Greater Odes*:\n\"No word goes unanswered,\nNo virtue goes unrewarded.\nCast me a peach, and I return a plum.\"\nThese words mean that those who love others will surely be loved, and those who hate others will surely be hated.\n\nYet why is it that the scholars of the world all hear of universality only to reject it? Do they consider it difficult and impossible to practice? Yet there have been things more difficult than this that were possible.\n\nIn ancient times, King Ling of Jing favored slender waists. During his reign, the gentlemen of Jing ate no more than one meal a day, rising only by propping themselves up and walking only by leaning against walls. Thus, restrained eating was deemed most difficult to practice—yet once practiced, it pleased King Ling. Though it had not yet spread through the world, the people could be swayed, for they sought to align themselves with their ruler.\n\nLong ago, King Goujian of Yue prized courage. He trained his officers and ministers for three years, yet deemed their understanding insufficient. He set fire to his ships, sounded the drums, and advanced—his warriors fell in the front ranks, perishing in water and flame in numbers beyond count. At that moment, none retreated without the drum’s command; the warriors of Yue could be called resolute. Thus, burning oneself was deemed most difficult to practice—yet once practiced, it pleased King Goujian. Though it had not yet spread through the world, the people could be swayed, for they sought to align themselves with their ruler.\n\nIn former days, Duke Wen of Jin favored plain attire. During his time, the gentlemen of Jin wore coarse cloth robes, unlined sheep-fur coats, hempen caps, and straight-soled shoes. They entered to see Duke Wen and departed to attend court in such dress. Thus, plain attire was deemed most difficult to practice—yet once practiced, it pleased Duke Wen. Though it had not yet spread through the world, the people could be swayed, for they sought to align themselves with their ruler.\n\nTherefore, restrained eating, burning ships, and plain attire—these were the most difficult things in the world to practice. Yet once practiced, they pleased the rulers, and though they had not yet spread through the world, the people could be swayed. Why was this? Because they sought to align themselves with their superiors.\n\nNow, as for mutual benefit shared universally, this brings advantage and is easy to practice—its benefits are beyond calculation. Yet I believe there are none among the rulers who advocate for it. If only there were rulers who did, encouraging it with rewards and praise, and enforcing it with penalties and punishments, then I believe people would embrace universal love and mutual benefit as naturally as fire rises upward or water flows downward—impossible to prevent throughout the world.\n\nThus, universality is the Dao of the sagely kings, the means by which kings, dukes, and great ministers secure their peace, and the reason the common people have sufficient clothing and food. Therefore, the noble person would do well to examine universality and strive to practice it: as a ruler, be benevolent; as a minister, be loyal; as a father, be kind; as a son, be filial; as an elder brother, be affectionate; as a younger brother, be respectful.\n\nThus, the noble person should desire to be a benevolent ruler, a loyal minister, a kind father, a filial son, an affectionate elder brother, or a respectful younger brother. For universality cannot but be practiced—this is the Dao of the sagely kings and the greatest benefit for the myriad people. *Mozi, Scroll Four ends here.*\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nNow, suppose there is a man who enters another’s garden and orchard, stealing their peaches and plums. The multitude hears of it and condemns him; the ruler who governs above, if he apprehends him, punishes him. Why is this? Because he harms others to benefit himself. When it comes to seizing another’s dogs, pigs, geese, or swine, his unrighteousness exceeds that of entering another’s garden to steal peaches and plums. Why is this? Because he harms others all the more, his lack of humaneness grows ever greater, and his crime becomes all the more grave. When it comes to entering another’s stable and pen to take their horses and cattle, his lack of humaneness and righteousness exceeds that of seizing another’s dogs, pigs, geese, or swine. Why is this? Because he harms others all the more; if he harms others all the more, his lack of humaneness grows ever greater, and his crime becomes all the more grave. When it comes to killing an innocent person, stripping them of their robes and furs, and taking their halberds and swords, his unrighteousness exceeds that of entering another’s stable and pen to take their horses and cattle. Why is this? Because he harms others all the more; if he harms others all the more, his lack of humaneness grows ever greater, and his crime becomes all the more grave. In such cases, the rulers of the world all know to condemn it, calling it unrighteous. Yet when it comes to the great act of attacking a state, they do not know to condemn it; instead, they follow and praise it, calling it righteous. How can this be said to distinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness?\n\nKilling one person is called unrighteous, and it necessarily incurs a death penalty. If we apply this reasoning further, killing ten people is tenfold unrighteousness, and it necessarily incurs ten death penalties. Killing a hundred people is a hundredfold unrighteousness, and it necessarily incurs a hundred death penalties. In such cases, the noble persons of the world all know to condemn it, calling it unrighteous. Yet when it comes to the great unrighteousness of attacking a state, they do not condemn it; instead, they follow and praise it, calling it righteous. Truly, they do not recognize its unrighteousness. Thus, they record their words to bequeath to later generations. If they knew it was unrighteous, why would they record its unrighteousness to bequeath to later generations?\n\nNow, suppose there is a man who, having seen little black, calls it black, but having seen much black, calls it white—one would say this man does not know the distinction between white and black. Or suppose one who, having tasted little bitterness, calls it bitter, but having tasted much bitterness, calls it sweet—one would surely say this man does not know the distinction between sweet and bitter. Now, when it comes to minor wrongs, they know to condemn them. But when it comes to the great wrong of attacking a state, they do not know to condemn it; instead, they follow and praise it, calling it righteous. Can this be said to know the distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness? Thus, we know that the noble persons of the world are confused about the distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness.\n\n*Condemning Offensive Warfare, Part Two*\n\nMaster Mozi said: In ancient times, when kings, dukes, and great ministers governed the state, they truly desired to scrutinize praise and blame, ensure proper rewards and punishments, and prevent errors in criminal administration. Therefore, Master Mozi said: In ancient times, there was a saying: \"If planning does not succeed, then use the past to know the future, use the visible to know the hidden. If planning is like this, it can be known.\" Now, when troops are mobilized, marching in winter, they fear the cold; marching in summer, they fear the heat—this cannot be done in both winter and summer. In spring, it disrupts the people’s plowing, planting, and cultivation; in autumn, it disrupts the people’s harvesting and gathering. If even one season is disrupted, the number of common people who die from hunger, cold, and starvation will be beyond counting.\n\nNow, let us calculate the military supplies: bamboo arrows, feathered banners, tents, armor, shields, and spears—those that are worn out, broken, and unusable are beyond counting. Add to this spears, halberds, dagger-axes, swords, and war chariots—those that are shattered, broken, and unusable are beyond counting. Add to this the oxen and horses that depart well-fed but return emaciated, or depart and die without returning—their number is beyond counting. Add to this the long and distant roads, where provisions are cut off and rain does not follow, and the number of common people who die is beyond counting. Add to this the lack of stable dwellings, untimely meals, and irregular hunger and fullness, and the number of common people who fall ill and die on the road is beyond counting. The loss of armies is beyond counting; the complete annihilation of armies is beyond calculation. Thus, the number of ghosts and spirits who lose their descendants is also beyond counting.\n\nThe state enacts policies that deprive the people of their strength and abolish their benefits to an extreme degree. Yet why do they do this? They say: \"I covet the fame of victory in attack and the benefits to be gained, so I do this.\" Master Mozi said: If we calculate what is gained by victory, it is of no use. If we calculate what is obtained, it does not compare to what is lost. Now, attacking a city of three *li* and an outer wall of seven *li*—if this can be done without sharp weapons, without killing, and merely by seizing it, then so be it. But killing many must number in the tens of thousands, and killing few must number in the thousands, before a city of three *li* and an outer wall of seven *li* can be taken.\n\nNow, a state of ten thousand chariots may empty its numbers by the thousands without victory and retreat; its vast territory may number in the tens of thousands without victory and be abandoned. Thus, land is what they have in excess, while people are what they lack. Now, to exhaust the deaths of the people, to intensify the suffering of high and low, and to contend for empty cities—this is to discard what they lack and further what they have in excess. Governing in this way is not the proper task of the state.\n\nThose who embellish offensive warfare say: \"To the south, they carved out the kings of Wu; to the north, they subdued the lords of Qi and Jin. When they were first enfeoffed in the world, the extent of their lands did not reach several hundred *li*, and the multitude of their people did not reach several hundred thousand. Because of offensive warfare, the breadth of their lands reached several thousand *li*, and the multitude of their people reached several million. Thus, offensive warfare cannot be abandoned.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: Even if four or five states gain profit from it, it is still called not following the Dao. It is like a physician’s medicine for those who are ill. Now, suppose there is a physician who mixes his medicinal incantations for all the ill in the world and administers medicine to them. If ten thousand people take this medicine, and only four or five benefit from it, it would still be called not practicing medicine properly.\n\nThus, the filial son does not feed his parents through such means, nor does the loyal minister feed his lord. In ancient times, when states were enfeoffed throughout the world, those of earlier times knew through what their ears had heard, and those of later times saw with their own eyes—those destroyed by offensive warfare were beyond counting.\n\nHow do we know this to be so? In the east, there was the state of Ju, small in size, which, though situated between great states, failed to respectfully serve them. Those great states, in turn, did not follow Ju’s lead nor seek its benefit. As a result, the Yue people to the east encroached upon and diminished its territory, while the Qi people to the west annexed and took possession of it. The reason Ju perished between Qi and Yue was precisely offensive warfare. Though in the south, Chen and Cai likewise perished between Wu and Yue for the same reason. Though in the north, states like Juyi and Buzhuohe perished between Yan, Dai, the Hu, and the Mo—again, because of offensive warfare.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: In ancient times, the lords and great men desired gain and detested loss, sought security and shunned danger. Thus, offensive warfare cannot but be condemned. Those who embellish the words of offensive warfare say: \"They could not rally and employ their multitudes, and so perished. I can rally and employ my multitudes—who in the world would dare not submit to me?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: Even if you can rally and employ your multitudes, how do you compare to King Helü of Wu in ancient times? King Helü of Wu trained for seven years, donning armor and wielding weapons, marching three hundred *li* before making camp. He passed through Zhulin, emerged from the perilous paths of Ming’ai, and fought at Baihu, cutting through the heart of Chu to receive the homage of Song and Lu. By the time of King Fuchai, he again attacked Qi, encamping at Wenshang and battling at Ailing, where he crushed the Qi forces and entrenched them at Mount Tai. Turning east to attack Yue, he crossed the Three Rivers and Five Lakes, entrenching them at Kuaiji. The nine Yi states all submitted without exception. Yet afterward, he failed to reward the orphaned, bestow alms upon the common folk, or rely on his own strength. Instead, he boasted of his achievements, praised his own wisdom, neglected his teachings, and proceeded to build the Terrace of Gusu, which remained unfinished after seven years. In this way, Wu fostered discontent and weariness. When King Goujian of Yue saw that the upper and lower ranks of Wu were at odds, he rallied his forces to renew his campaigns. Entering the northern suburbs, relocating the great inner palace, and besieging the royal palace, he brought about the destruction of Wu.\n\nIn former times, Jin had six generals, among whom Zhibo was the strongest. Calculating the breadth of his lands and the multitude of his people, he sought to resist the feudal lords, aspiring to the swift renown of offensive warfare. Thus, he meticulously selected his crack troops, arrayed his chariots and soldiers, and attacked the Zhonghang clan, seizing their lands. Confident in his schemes, he then attacked the Fan clan and utterly defeated them. Having merged three clans into one, he did not stop there but laid siege to Zhao Xiangzi at Jinchang. At this point, Han and Wei conferred, saying: \"As the ancient saying goes, 'When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold.' If Zhao perishes in the morning, we shall follow by evening. If Zhao perishes in the evening, we shall follow by morning.\" The *Book of Songs* says: \"If the fish and water do not unite, what will become of them on land?\" Thus, the three lords united their hearts and strength, opened the gates and cleared the roads, donned armor and roused their troops. Han and Wei attacked from without, Zhao from within, and together they struck Zhibo, crushing him utterly.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: There is an ancient saying: \"The noble man does not use water as a mirror but uses men. A mirror of water shows only the face’s appearance; a mirror of men reveals fortune and misfortune.\" If you consider offensive warfare profitable, have you not reflected on the affair of Zhibo? That it brings misfortune rather than fortune can already be known.\n\n*Against Offensive Warfare, Part Three*\n\nMaster Mozi said: What is the explanation for the world’s praise of goodness today? Is it because such actions align with the benefit of Heaven above, the spirits in the middle, and the people below, and thus are praised? Or is it not for these reasons that they are praised? Even the most foolish among the people would say: It is because such actions align with the benefit of Heaven above, the spirits in the middle, and the people below that they are praised.\n\nToday, what the world universally upholds are the laws of the sage-kings. Yet if the feudal lords of the world continue to engage in offensive warfare and annexation, they merely possess the name of praising righteousness without examining its reality. This is like a blind man who, when asked to distinguish between white and black, cannot discern the objects—how can he be said to truly know the difference?\n\nThus, the wise of ancient times, in planning for the world, necessarily considered the rightness of an action before proceeding. Only then did they act without hesitation, swiftly achieving success, attaining their desires, and aligning with the benefit of Heaven, the spirits, and the people. This is the way of the wise.\n\nTherefore, the benevolent rulers of antiquity who held the world necessarily reversed the doctrines of great states, unified the harmony of the world, and gathered all within the four seas. They led the people of the world to serve the Lord on High, the mountains and rivers, and the spirits with the labor of farming. Their benefit to the people was great, and their achievements were vast. Thus, Heaven rewarded them, the spirits enriched them, and the people praised them, making them noble as the Son of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven, their names joining Heaven and Earth, enduring to this day without fading. This is the way of the wise, the means by which the former kings held the world.\n\nYet the lords and great men, the feudal lords of the world today, act otherwise. They meticulously select their crack troops, array their chariots and soldiers, forge sturdy armor and sharp weapons, and proceed to attack and invade blameless states.\n\nUpon breaching the borders of a state, they reap its crops, fell its trees, raze its walls and ramparts to fill its moats and ditches, slaughter its sacrificial livestock, and demolish its ancestral temples. They ruthlessly kill its people, trample its elderly and weak, and carry off its treasures. When the troops advance, they are exhorted at the clamor of battle: \"To die in service is supreme; to kill many is next; to be wounded is the least.\" How much worse, then, is it to be the first to flee in defeat? Such a crime is punishable by death without mercy! This is how they rally their forces.\n\nYet to annex states and annihilate armies, to ravage the people and disrupt the legacy of the sages—can this truly be deemed beneficial to Heaven? To seize the people of Heaven and attack the cities of Heaven is to slaughter the people of Heaven, desecrate the abodes of the spirits, overthrow the altars of the soil and grain, and slaughter the sacrificial victims. This is surely not in accord with Heaven’s benefit. Can it be deemed beneficial to the spirits? To kill their worshippers, extinguish the lords of the spirits, abolish the former kings, and ravage the people—causing the common folk to scatter—this is surely not in accord with the spirits’ benefit. Can it be deemed beneficial to the people? To kill them for the sake of profit is already excessive. Moreover, when one calculates the costs, this exhausts the very foundation of life, depleting the resources of the people under Heaven beyond measure. Thus, it is surely not in accord with the people’s benefit.\n\nNow, those who lead armies speak of the many ways such actions bring no advantage: the general lacks courage, the officers are undisciplined, the weapons are dull, the troops are untrained, the army is too small, the soldiers are disunited, their might is insufficient, their harms are not enduring, their struggles are not swift, their defenses are not strong, their resolve is not firm, and the feudal lords of allied states are doubtful. When allied lords are doubtful, the enemy’s plans take shape, and their intentions grow weak. If one proceeds with such deficiencies, the state loses its troops, and the people abandon their labors.\n\nNow, observe the states that delight in attack and conquest: when they mobilize their forces, nobles and commoners alike must number in the thousands, with conscripts and laborers reaching the hundreds of thousands, before they can set their armies in motion. Such campaigns may last years or, at best, months. During this time, the ruler has no leisure to attend to governance, officials cannot manage their offices, farmers cannot tend their fields, and women cannot spin or weave. Thus, the state loses its troops, and the people abandon their labors.\n\nMoreover, their chariots and horses are worn out, their tents and canopies, the supplies of the three armies, and the provisions for armor and weapons—even if only one-fifth remain, it is still insufficient. Then there are those who perish along the roads: the routes are long, provisions cannot keep pace, and when the time comes to eat and drink, the laborers suffer from hunger, cold, exhaustion, illness, and disease, dying in droves in the ditches. The harm this inflicts upon the people is profound, a grave calamity for all under Heaven. Yet the lords and great men delight in such actions—this is to take pleasure in the destruction of the people of the world. Is this not perverse?\n\nNow, among the warlike states of the world—Qi, Jin, Chu, and Yue—if these four were to have their way, their populations would increase tenfold, yet they would still be unable to fill their lands. This is a case of too few people and too much land. Yet they continue to fight over territory, thereby diminishing what is already insufficient while further increasing what is already in excess.\n\nNow, the lords who delight in attack and conquest further embellish their arguments to refute Mozi, saying: \"Is not the use of force to punish unrighteousness beneficial?\" In ancient times, Yu campaigned against the Three Miao, Tang overthrew Jie, and King Wu defeated Zhou—all were established as sage-kings. Why is this so? Mozi replied: \"You have not examined the nature of my words or understood their meaning. What they did was not called 'attack' but 'punishment.'\"\n\nIn the time of the Three Miao, great chaos arose. Heaven’s decree was upon them: omens appeared, blood rained for three days, dragons emerged in the temples, wailing filled the markets, the earth split to the springs, and the five grains mutated, causing the people great distress. Gaoyang then commanded the Dark Palace, and Yu personally grasped Heaven’s auspicious mandate to campaign against the Three Miao. Lightning and thunder guided the way; a spirit with the face of a man and the body of a crow, bearing jade-like tokens, attended him. Yi loosed arrows at the Miao’s omens, and the Miao’s forces fell into chaos, soon to be subdued. After Yu had conquered the Three Miao, he demarcated the mountains and rivers, distinguished the ranks of beings, established the great norms, and ensured that spirits and people did not transgress. The world was then at peace—this was Yu’s punishment of the Three Miao.\n\nAs for Jie of Xia, Heaven’s mandate was withdrawn: the sun and moon were untimely, cold and heat arrived in disorder, the five grains withered and died, ghosts wailed in the state, and cranes cried for over ten nights. Heaven then commanded Tang at the Biao Palace, entrusting him with Xia’s great mandate: \"The virtue of Xia is in great disorder. I have already ended its mandate from Heaven. Go and punish it, and you shall surely be capable.\" Tang dared to lead his forces to the borders of Xia, where the Lord on High sent dark forces to destroy Xia’s cities. Soon after, a spirit came to announce: \"The virtue of Xia is in great disorder. Go and attack it, and I shall surely make you capable.\" Having received the mandate from Heaven, Heaven sent a blazing fire to the northwest corner of Xia’s cities. Tang, leading Jie’s forces, conquered Xia, assembled the feudal lords at Bo, presented the decree of Heaven, and proclaimed it to the four quarters. The feudal lords of the world dared not but submit—this was Tang’s punishment of Jie.\n\nAs for King Zhou of Shang, Heaven did not order his virtue: the sacrifices were untimely, and for ten nights, the sun and moon rained down upon Bo. The Nine Tripods shifted, women took on ominous appearances, ghosts wailed at night, women became men, Heaven rained flesh, thorns grew on the roads, and the king’s elder brother indulged himself without restraint.\n\nA red crow bearing a jade tablet descended upon the altar of Qi in Zhou, proclaiming: \"Heaven commands King Wen of Zhou to punish Yin and take possession of the realm.\" Taidian came to submit, the Yellow River yielded the Green Chart, and the earth produced the divine steed Huang. King Wu fulfilled his merit, dreaming of three spirits who declared: \"I have already drowned Zhou of Yin in the virtue of wine. Go and attack him, and I shall surely make you greatly capable.\" King Wu then struck down the madman, overthrowing Shang to establish Zhou, and Heaven bestowed upon him the banner of the yellow crow. Having conquered Yin, the king completed the work of the August Emperor, apportioning sacrifices to the various spirits, honoring the former kings of Yin, and extending his reach to the four barbarians. Thus, none under Heaven dared not submit, and he inherited Tang’s legacy—this was King Wu’s punishment of Zhou.\n\nViewing these three sage-kings, it was not called \"attack\" but \"punishment.\" Yet rulers who delight in aggression embellish their arguments to refute Mozi, saying: \"Do you consider attack and conquest unrighteous? Do they not benefit the world?\" In ancient times, Chu’s Xiong Li first campaigned in the region of Mount Sui, King Goujian of Yue emerged from Youju to found his state, Tang Shu and Lü Shang established Qi and Jin. Each of these began with territories of only a few hundred *li*, yet through the annexation of states, they came to rule a quarter of the world. How is this so?\n\nMozi replied: \"You have not examined the categories of my words nor understood their reasons. In antiquity, when the Son of Heaven first enfeoffed the feudal lords, there were over ten thousand. Now, through the annexation of states, over ten thousand have been destroyed, leaving only four standing. This is like a physician whose medicine cures only four out of ten thousand—he cannot be called a good doctor.\" Such rulers further adorn their claims, saying: \"It is not that I lack gold, jade, women, or land. I seek to establish a righteous name under Heaven and attract the feudal lords through virtue.\"\n\nMozi said: \"If one could truly establish a righteous name under Heaven and attract the feudal lords through virtue, the submission of the world could be awaited in an instant. Yet the world has long been mired in aggression, like a colt broken to the saddle. If one could demonstrate trustworthiness and prioritize the benefit of the feudal lords, then when a great state acts unjustly, all would share its sorrow; when it attacks a small state, all would come to its rescue. If a small state’s walls are incomplete, they would be repaired; if its grain stores are exhausted, they would be replenished; if its silk and cloth are insufficient, they would be supplied. By thus demonstrating to great states, the rulers of small states would rejoice. If others toil while we rest, our armor and weapons grow strong. With generosity and relief in times of urgency, the people will surely turn to us. By replacing aggression with governance, our attacks will be twice as effective. Calculating the cost of our campaigns and exposing the exhaustion of the feudal lords, we may surely secure order and advantage. Supervising with rectitude and justifying our name, we must strive to be lenient with our people and trustworthy with our troops. By thus instructing the armies of the feudal lords, we would be invincible under Heaven, and our benefits to the world would be beyond count. This is the true benefit of the world, yet if kings, dukes, and great officials remain unaware and persist in such practices, they may be called ministers who know not how to benefit the world.\"\n\nThus, Mozi declared: \"Now, if the kings, dukes, gentlemen, and officers of the world truly desire to seek the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm, they must recognize that the incessant practice of aggression is indeed the greatest harm under Heaven. If one wishes to practice benevolence and righteousness, to strive for the rank of superior scholar, to follow the Way of the sage-kings above and seek the benefit of states and common people below, then one must uphold the doctrine of *non-aggression*—this is what cannot be left unexamined.\" *Mozi, Scroll Five ends. Scroll Six.*\n\n**Moderation in Expenditure, Part One (Chapter Twenty)**\n\nWhen the sage governs a single state, the state’s resources may be doubled. When he governs the entire world, the world’s resources may be doubled. This doubling is not achieved by seizing land from without, but by taking the existing state and removing what is superfluous—thus doubling its wealth.\n\nWhen the sage-king governs, every decree he issues and every affair he initiates, every convenience for the people and every expenditure of wealth, is done without waste. Therefore, wealth is not squandered, the people are not overburdened, and the benefits they receive are manifold.\n\nWhat is the purpose of clothing and furs? In winter, they ward off the cold; in summer, they shield from the heat. The principle of making garments is this: if they provide added warmth in winter or added coolness in summer, they are retained. If they do not, they are discarded.\n\nWhat is the purpose of palaces and dwellings? In winter, they block wind and cold; in summer, they shelter from heat and rain. If they provide added security against thieves and bandits, they are retained. If they do not, they are discarded.\n\nWhat is the purpose of armor, shields, and the five weapons? To defend against raiders, rebels, and bandits. When raiders, rebels, and bandits arise, those with armor, shields, and the five weapons prevail, while those without are defeated. Thus, the sage creates armor, shields, and the five weapons. The principle of making them is this: if they are lighter, more durable, and harder to break, they are retained. If they are not, they are discarded.\n\nWhat is the purpose of boats and carts? Carts travel over hills and land, boats traverse rivers and valleys, connecting the benefits of the four directions. The principle of making boats and carts is this: if they are lighter and more efficient, they are retained. If they are not, they are discarded.\n\nIn all these things, nothing is made without purpose. Therefore, wealth is not squandered, the people are not overburdened, and the benefits they receive are manifold.\n\nIf we eliminate the extravagant preferences of great men—amassing pearls, jades, exotic birds, beasts, dogs, and horses—and instead increase the quantity of clothing, dwellings, armor, shields, the five weapons, boats, and carts, would this not multiply their number severalfold? Such a task is not difficult. What, then, is truly difficult? Only the doubling of the population is difficult. Yet even the population can be doubled.\n\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings established this law: a man at twenty years of age must not fail to establish a household; a woman at fifteen must not fail to serve a husband. This was the law of the sage-kings. After the sage-kings passed, the people followed a different standard. Those who wished to marry early did so at twenty; those who wished to marry late did so at forty. Comparing the early and late, this lagged ten years behind the sage-kings’ law. If a woman bears a child every three years, she may have two or three children in that time. Would this not allow the people to marry earlier and thus double the population? Indeed, it would.\n\nNow, those who govern the world today employ many methods that diminish the people. They impose heavy labor upon the people, levy exorbitant taxes, and leave the people’s resources insufficient—so many freeze or starve to death that they cannot be counted. Moreover, the rulers dispatch armies to invade neighboring states: some campaigns last a full year, others mere months, keeping men and women apart for long stretches. This is one of the ways they diminish the people. Others die from unstable living conditions, irregular meals, or illness brought on by toil; still more perish in raids, ambushes, assaults on cities, or battles in the wild—so many that they cannot be counted. Are these not the very policies by which those who govern today multiply the means of diminishing the people?\n\nWhen the sages governed, they did not resort to such measures. When those who are not sages govern, do they not multiply the ways of harming the people? Thus Master Mo declared: “Abandon the useless—this is the great benefit of the sage-kings’ Way for all under Heaven.”\n\n**Moderation in Use, Part Two**\n\nMaster Mo said: In ancient times, the enlightened kings and sages who ruled all under Heaven and governed the feudal lords did so because they cherished the people with utmost care, served them with unwavering loyalty, and brought them benefit with the greatest generosity. Their loyalty and trust were interwoven, and they continually demonstrated what was advantageous—thus the people never wearied of them throughout their lives, nor did their influence wane even twenty years after their passing. This is how the enlightened kings and sages of old ruled all under Heaven and governed the feudal lords.\n\nTherefore, the sage-kings of antiquity established laws for moderation in use, decreeing: Let all the hundred artisans under Heaven—those who transport goods, build carts, weave mats, craft pottery, forge metal, fell timber, or work as carpenters—each devote themselves to their respective crafts. The rule was: Whatever suffices to supply the people’s needs, any additional expense that does not further benefit the people must cease.\n\nThe sage-kings also established laws for food and drink, decreeing: Let it suffice to fill the void, sustain the qi, strengthen the limbs, and sharpen the ears and eyes—then stop. Do not pursue the utmost refinement of the five flavors or the perfect harmony of fragrances; do not seek rare delicacies or exotic goods from distant lands. How do we know this to be so?\n\nIn ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he soothed the lands of Jiao to the south and descended upon Youdu in the north; from east to west, wherever the sun rose and set, none failed to submit in homage, establishing a profound love. Millet and sorghum were not doubled, and broths were not layered. They drank from earthen mounds and sipped from clay vessels, ladling with gourds. Bowing, rising, and turning in ceremonial decorum—such rites the sage-kings did not observe.\n\nThe sage-kings of old established laws for clothing, decreeing: In winter, wear garments of felted red, light yet warm; in summer, wear garments of fine linen, light yet cool—then stop. Any expense that does not further benefit the people, the sage-kings did not undertake.\n\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings, seeing that fierce birds, cunning beasts, and violent men harmed the people, thereupon taught the people to bear arms. They wore swords daily: for stabbing, they pierced; for striking, they severed; even when struck from the side, they did not break—such was the advantage of the sword. Armor as clothing was light and effective; when in motion, weapons followed—such was the advantage of armor. Chariots served to carry heavy loads and reach distant places; riding them brought safety, pulling them brought ease. Safe, they did not harm people; swift, they hastened arrival—such was the advantage of the chariot.\n\nWhen the sage-kings saw that great rivers and broad valleys could not be crossed, they devised boats and oars, sufficient for passage—then stopped. Even when the Three Dukes and feudal lords arrived, boats and oars were not altered, and ferrymen did not adorn themselves—such was the advantage of boats.\n\nThe sage-kings established laws for frugal burials, decreeing: Three garments suffice to rot the flesh; a coffin three inches thick suffices to rot the bones. Dig the grave deep enough not to reach the springs, ensuring no leakage—then stop. Once the dead are buried, the living should not mourn for long with grief.\n\nIn ancient times, when humans first came into being, there were no palaces or houses, so they dwelled in caves dug into hills and mounds. The sage-kings considered this and thought: Though digging caves may shield from wind and cold in winter, in summer, the lower parts grow damp, the upper parts heavy with moisture, fearing harm to the people’s qi. Thus, they constructed palaces and houses for benefit.\n\nWhat, then, were the principles for building palaces and houses? Master Mozi said: Let their sides block wind and cold, their tops shield from snow, frost, rain, and dew; let their interiors be clean and bright for sacrifices; let their walls suffice to separate men and women—then stop. Any expense that does not further benefit the people, the sage-kings did not undertake.\n\n*[Sections omitted: \"Moderation in Use, Part Two\" (22), \"Frugal Burial, Part One\" (23), \"Frugal Burial, Part Two\" (24), \"Frugal Burial, Part Three\" (25)]*\n\nMaster Mozi said: The benevolent, in their planning for the world, differ not from the filial child planning for their parents. How does the filial child plan for their parents? They say: If the parents are poor, they strive to enrich them; if the people are few, they strive to increase them; if the multitude is chaotic, they strive to govern them. When faced with these tasks, if their strength is insufficient, their resources inadequate, or their wisdom lacking, only then do they desist. They dare not withhold their remaining strength, conceal their plans, or leave benefits unexploited without doing all they can for their parents. Such are the three duties in the filial child’s planning for their parents.\n\nEven the benevolent’s planning for the world follows this same pattern. They say: If the world is poor, strive to enrich it; if the people are few, strive to increase them; if the multitude is chaotic, strive to govern it. When faced with these tasks, if their strength is insufficient, their resources inadequate, or their wisdom lacking, only then do they desist. They dare not withhold their remaining strength, conceal their plans, or leave benefits unexploited without doing all they can for the world. Such are the three duties in the benevolent’s planning for the world.\n\nNow, since the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties passed away, the world has lost its righteousness. Later generations of noble men have debated: Some regard lavish burials and prolonged mourning as benevolence, righteousness, and the duty of a filial child. Others regard them as neither benevolent nor righteous, nor the duty of a filial child. These two parties, though their words oppose each other and their actions contradict, both claim: \"We follow the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu.\" Yet their words oppose, and their actions contradict. Thus, later generations of noble men are all perplexed by the words of these two parties.\n\nIf one is indeed perplexed by the words of these two parties, then let us tentatively put them into practice in governing the state and the myriad people and observe: In calculating lavish burials and prolonged mourning, which of the three benefits—enriching the poor, increasing the few, or pacifying danger and governing chaos—do they truly serve? If, in my judgment, following their words and employing their plans, lavish burials and prolonged mourning can indeed enrich the poor, increase the few, pacify danger, and govern chaos, then this is benevolence, righteousness, and the duty of a filial child. Those who plan for others cannot but encourage it. The benevolent, seeking to promote this for the world, will make it so that the people praise it and never abandon it.\n\nBut if, in my judgment, following their words and employing their plans, lavish burials and prolonged mourning cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, pacify danger, or govern chaos, then this is neither benevolence nor righteousness, nor the duty of a filial child. Those who plan for others cannot but discourage it. The benevolent, seeking to promote this for the world, will make it so that the people praise it and never abandon it.\n\nOr if, following their words and employing their plans, lavish burials and prolonged mourning truly cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, pacify danger, or govern chaos, then this is neither benevolence nor righteousness, nor the duty of a filial child. Those who plan for others cannot but oppose it. The benevolent, seeking to eliminate this, will make it so that the world rejects it and people condemn it, never to be practiced again.\n\nMoreover, to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm—yet today, the disorder of the state and the people is unprecedented from ancient times to the present. How do we know this to be so? Now, the scholars and gentlemen of the world still largely doubt whether lavish burials and prolonged mourning are correct or incorrect, beneficial or harmful.\n\nThus Master Mozi declared: Let us then examine this matter. Even if we do not adopt the words of those who advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning, yet when it comes to affairs of state, this much remains: among the kings, dukes, and great officials who suffer bereavement, the coffins and outer coffins must be layered thick, the burial deep, the mourning garments numerous, the embroidered patterns elaborate, and the tomb mounds vast. As for the deaths of ordinary gentlemen and commoners, they nearly exhaust their households. When feudal lords die, their treasuries are emptied, and then gold, jade, pearls, and precious stones are heaped upon the body, bound with cords and knots, while chariots and horses are interred in the grave pit. Moreover, they must furnish many canopies, tripods, drums, silken banners, ritual vessels, halberds, swords, feathered ornaments, and leather goods, burying them all with the dead. If they wish to satisfy their desire for human sacrifice, they say: when the Son of Heaven is buried, the many number in the hundreds, the few in the tens; when generals and great officials are buried, the many number in the tens, the few in the single digits.\n\nWhat then are the rules for observing mourning? They say: weeping and wailing without order, tears flowing as sackcloth and hemp hang heavy, dwelling in a mourning hut, sleeping on rough mats with a clod of earth for a pillow. They further compel one another to force themselves not to eat, feigning hunger, and to wear thin garments, feigning cold, so that their faces become gaunt and sallow, their complexions darkened and dull, their ears and eyes no longer sharp, their hands and feet no longer strong—rendering them useless. It is also said: the conduct of a superior man in mourning must be such that he can only rise with support and walk with a staff, thus enduring for three years.\n\nIf we follow such words and practice such ways, and kings, dukes, and great officials observe this, they will surely be unable to attend court early to manage the five offices and six ministries, clear wastelands, or fill granaries. If farmers observe this, they will surely be unable to go out early and return late to plow, sow, plant, and cultivate. If artisans observe this, they will surely be unable to repair boats and chariots or craft vessels and utensils. If women observe this, they will surely be unable to rise early and retire late to spin, weave, and dye.\n\nIn careful calculation, lavish burials amount to burying much accumulated wealth, while prolonged mourning amounts to long prohibitions on work. Wealth that has been amassed is buried away; those who might later produce are long forbidden to do so. To seek prosperity in this way is like forbidding plowing yet hoping for a harvest—there is no possible argument for attaining wealth. Thus, in seeking to enrich the household, it is already impossible. If one wishes to increase the population, can this be the way? The argument for that, too, is impossible.\n\nShould the governance of the state now be founded upon lavish burials and prolonged mourning, then when the ruler dies, mourning shall last three years; when father or mother dies, mourning shall last three years; when wife or eldest son dies, all five shall mourn for three years. Thereafter, uncles, brothers, illegitimate sons, clansmen, paternal aunts, sisters, nephews, and maternal uncles shall each observe mourning for a set number of months—thus emaciation and wasting shall surely be regulated. Faces shall become sunken and sallow, complexions darkened and soot-like, ears and eyes dull, hands and feet feeble, rendering one unfit for use.\n\nIt is further said: The superior man, in observing mourning, must lean upon others to rise and walk with a staff—thus shall he endure for three years. Should such laws and words be followed as the Way, then hunger and privation shall be as this. Hence, in winter the people shall not withstand the cold, in summer they shall not endure the heat, and those who fall ill and die shall be beyond counting. This greatly disrupts the union of men and women, and in seeking to increase the population, it is like ordering a man to bear a sword while hoping for his longevity—there is no possible argument for attaining a multitude. Thus, in seeking to multiply the people, it is already impossible.\n\nDoes one wish to govern with penal laws? Can this be the way? The argument for that, too, is impossible. Should the governance of the state now be founded upon lavish burials and prolonged mourning, the nation shall surely grow poor, the people few, and penal governance chaotic. Should such laws and words be followed as the Way, those above shall be unable to attend to governance, and those below shall be unable to engage in work. If those above cannot attend to governance, penal laws shall surely be in disorder; if those below cannot engage in work, clothing and food shall surely be insufficient. Should they be insufficient, younger brothers seeking their elder brothers shall not find them, and the undutiful shall surely resent their elder brothers; sons seeking their parents shall not find them, and the unfilial shall surely resent their parents; ministers seeking their ruler shall not find him, and the disloyal shall surely rebel against their superiors.\n\nThus, the people of perverse and licentious conduct shall go forth without clothing and return without food. Within, they shall lack sustenance, and together they shall turn to wanton violence, becoming impossible to restrain. Hence, thieves and bandits shall multiply while those who govern shall be few. To first multiply thieves and bandits and then seek order is like ordering a man to bear three burdens at dawn and forbidding him to falter—there is no possible argument for attaining governance. Thus, in seeking to govern with penal laws, it is already impossible.\n\nDoes one wish to prevent great states from attacking small states? Can this be the way? The argument for that, too, is impossible. Thus, in former times, when the sage-kings had passed, the world lost its righteousness, and the feudal lords waged war by force. In the south were the kings of Chu and Yue, and in the north the lords of Qi and Jin—all honed their troops to attack, conquer, and govern the world through annexation. Therefore, the reason great states do not attack small states is that the latter possess abundant stores, well-maintained walls and moats, and harmony between ruler and subject—thus great states do not delight in attacking them. Without stores, with walls and moats unmaintained, and without harmony between ruler and subject, great states shall surely attack them.\n\nShould the governance of the state now be founded upon lavish burials and prolonged mourning, the nation shall surely grow poor, the people few, and penal governance chaotic. Should it be poor, there shall be no stores. Should the people be few, those to maintain walls and moats shall be few. Should governance be chaotic, they shall be unable to prevail in battle and unable to hold their defenses. In seeking to prevent great states from attacking small states, it is already impossible.\n\nDoes one wish to seek the blessings of the Supreme Lord and the spirits? Can this be the way? The argument for that, too, is impossible.\n\nNow, should governance be founded upon lavish burials and prolonged mourning, the nation shall surely grow poor, the people few, and penal governance chaotic. Should it be poor, this is to discard fine wine and sweet ale without cooling or purifying them. Should the people be few, those who serve the Supreme Lord and the spirits shall be few. Should governance be chaotic, sacrifices shall not be offered in due season or measure.\n\nIf one now prohibits the service of the Supreme Lord and the spirits, and governs thus, the Supreme Lord and the spirits shall begin to regard them from above, saying: \"Do We prefer having such people, or having none at all?\" They shall say: \"Whether We have such people or none at all, there is no difference.\" Then, as before, the Supreme Lord and the spirits shall send down upon them the punishments of calamity and misfortune, and cast them aside. Is this not indeed what they deserve?\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings established laws for burial, saying: \"A coffin of three inches is sufficient to rot the body. Three garments of mourning are sufficient to cover the foulness.\" When burying, it should be neither so deep as to reach the springs below nor so shallow as to allow the stench to rise above. The grave mound should resemble a field plowed three times—no more. Once the dead are buried, the living must not mourn for long but swiftly return to their affairs. People should do what they are capable of, exchanging mutual benefit. Such were the laws of the sage-kings.\n\nYet those who advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning say: \"Though lavish burials and prolonged mourning may not enrich the poor, increase the few, stabilize the perilous, or order the chaotic, they are the Way of the sage-kings.\" Master Mozi said: Not so.\n\nOf old, Yao taught the Eight Di in the north. When he died on the road, he was buried on the northern slope of Mount Yao. He was clothed in three garments of mourning, and his coffin was made of wood from the valley. It was bound with kudzu, and after the peach-wood bier was set down, they wailed. The grave mound was unsealed, level with the ground. After the burial, oxen and horses trampled over it.\n\nShun taught the Seven Rong in the west. When he died on the road, he was buried in the marketplace of Nanshi. He was clothed in three garments of mourning, and his coffin was made of wood from the valley, bound with kudzu. After the burial, the people of the marketplace trampled over it.\n\nYu taught the Nine Yi in the east. When he died on the road, he was buried on Mount Kuaiji. He was clothed in three garments of mourning, and his coffin was made of paulownia wood, three inches thick. It was bound with kudzu, the joints unsealed, the seams uncaulked. The grave was dug neither so deep as to reach the springs below nor so shallow as to allow the stench to rise above. After the burial, the remaining earth was gathered atop it, and the grave mound resembled a field plowed three times—no more.\n\nIf we observe these three sage-kings, then lavish burials and prolonged mourning are indeed not the Way of the sage-kings. These three kings were all exalted as Sons of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven. Did they worry that their resources were insufficient? They established such laws for burial.\n\nYet today, the kings, dukes, and great men conduct burials differently. They must have an outer coffin and an inner coffin, three layers of leather curtains, jade disks and ornaments in full array, halberds, swords, tripods, drums, jars, and basins, embroidered silks and plain weaves, ten thousand mourning garments, carriages, horses, and female musicians—all prepared. The grave mound must be as grand as a mountain. This halts the people’s work and squanders their wealth beyond measure. Such practices are utterly useless.\n\nThus, Master Mozi said: Formerly, I began by saying: If one adopts their words, employs their plans, and calculates that lavish burials and prolonged mourning can enrich the poor, increase the few, stabilize the perilous, and order the chaotic, then it is benevolent, righteous, and the duty of a filial son. One who plans for others cannot but encourage it. But if one adopts their words, employs their plans, and finds that lavish burials and prolonged mourning truly cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, stabilize the perilous, or order the chaotic, then it is not benevolent, not righteous, and not the duty of a filial son. One who plans for others cannot but oppose it.\n\nThus, in seeking to enrich the nation, one achieves the very opposite—poverty. In seeking to increase the people, one achieves the very opposite—fewness. In seeking to order governance, one achieves the very opposite—chaos. In seeking to prevent great states from attacking small states, it is already impossible. In seeking the blessings of the Supreme Lord and the spirits, one incurs misfortune instead.\n\nExamining above, it contradicts the Way of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. Examining below, it aligns with the deeds of Jie, Zhou, You, and Li. From this perspective, lavish burials and prolonged mourning are not the Way of the sage-kings.\n\nYet those who advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning say: \"If lavish burials and prolonged mourning are indeed not the Way of the sage-kings, why do the gentlemen of the Central States persist in them without ceasing or choosing otherwise?\" Master Mozi said: This is what is called \"convenient to their habits and justified by their customs.\"\n\nOf old, in the state of Zhuomu to the east of Yue, when the eldest son was born, they dismembered and ate him, calling it \"beneficial to the younger brother.\" When the grandfather died, they carried the grandmother on their backs and abandoned her, saying: \"A ghost’s wife cannot dwell with us.\" The rulers above made this their governance, and the people below made it their custom. They persisted in it without ceasing or choosing otherwise. Is this truly the Way of benevolence and righteousness? This is what is called \"convenient to their habits and justified by their customs.\"\n\nTo the south of Chu, there was the state of the Yanren. When their kin died, they rotted the flesh and discarded it, then buried the bones, and only then were they deemed filial sons.\n\nTo the west of Qin, there was the state of Yibing. When their kin died, they gathered firewood and burned the body, the smoke rising upward, calling it \"ascending to the distant.\" Only then were they deemed filial sons. The rulers above made this their governance, and the people below made it their custom. They persisted in it without ceasing or choosing otherwise. Is this truly the Way of benevolence and righteousness? This is what is called \"convenient to their habits and justified by their customs.\"\n\nIf we observe these three states, their practices are indeed meager. If the gentlemen of the Central States observe them, their practices are indeed lavish. Compared to those, they are excessively lavish; compared to these, they are excessively meager. Thus, burial must have its proper measure.\n\nThus, clothing and food are the benefits of life, yet even these must be moderated; burial is the benefit of death—how could it alone be without moderation? Master Mozi established his regulations for burial: a coffin three inches thick, sufficient to rot the bones; three garments, sufficient to rot the flesh; the depth of the grave dug so that below, it does not reach dampness, and above, qi does not escape; the mound enough to mark the place—this is all. Weep when going, weep when returning, then return to managing the resources of clothing and food, and together attend to sacrifices to express filial piety toward one’s kin.\n\nThus it is said: Master Mozi’s regulations do not lose sight of the benefits of life and death—this is it. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Now, the scholar-gentlemen of the world who claim they wish to practice benevolence and righteousness, seek to be superior men, aspire above to follow the Way of the sage-kings, and below to benefit the states, families, and common people, must take moderation in funerals as governance and cannot but examine this.\n\nIf one provides meals but the food is insufficient to nourish the living, and the expenses are such that they cannot sustain the people’s needs, then one should stop. Any additional expenditure that does not bring benefit to the people is something the sage-kings would not do.\n\nTo plan for others, one cannot but encourage moderation. If one intends to model their words and adopt their strategies, then elaborate burials and prolonged mourning truly cannot determine wealth or poverty, increase or decrease, stabilize peril or govern chaos. This is neither benevolent nor righteous, nor is it the duty of a filial child. Those who plan for others cannot but discourage such practices. The benevolent will seek to eliminate them—who in the world would allow the people to condemn them and persist in such conduct for a lifetime?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Now, if the scholar-gentlemen of the world wish to practice benevolence and righteousness, seek to be superior men, and above aspire to follow the Way of the sage-kings while below benefiting the states, families, and common people, they must take moderation in funerals as governance. If they do not examine this, then they are not acting as those who plan for others. How can they be considered benevolent and righteous? How can they be called superior men? Thus, those who claim to follow the Way of the sage-kings yet do not practice moderation in funerals are like one who speaks of archery but does not draw the bow, or one who discusses driving but does not mount the carriage—how can they reach their destination?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Now, the scholar-gentlemen of the world know the small but not the great. How do we know this? We know it from how they conduct themselves in their households. If one living in a household offends the head of the family, there are still neighboring households to flee to. Yet even then, relatives, brothers, and acquaintances will admonish one another, all saying: \"One must be vigilant! One must be cautious! How can one live in a household and offend the head of the family and still consider it acceptable?\" This is not only true for households—it is the same even for states. If one living in a state offends the ruler, there are still neighboring states to flee to. Yet even then, relatives, brothers, and acquaintances will admonish one another, all saying: \"One must be vigilant! One must be cautious! Who would live in a state, offend the ruler, and still consider it acceptable?\" In such cases, there are places to flee, and the warnings are already so grave. How much more severe should the warnings be when there is nowhere to flee?\n\nMoreover, there is a saying: \"Where can one hide in the light of day? Where can one flee if one offends?\" The answer is: nowhere to flee. For the heavens cannot be concealed in forests, valleys, or secluded gates where no one dwells—brightness will surely reveal all. Yet the scholar-gentlemen of the world suddenly forget to admonish one another regarding Heaven. This is how I know that the scholar-gentlemen of the world know the small but not the great.\n\nNow then, what does Heaven desire, and what does it detest? Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness. Thus, if we lead the people of the world to act in accordance with righteousness, we are doing what Heaven desires. If we do what Heaven desires, Heaven will also do what we desire. Now, what do we desire, and what do we detest? We desire blessings and prosperity and detest misfortune and calamity. Yet if we lead the people of the world into misfortune and calamity, how can we know that Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness?\n\nIt is said: Where there is righteousness, there is life; where there is no righteousness, there is death. Where there is righteousness, there is wealth; where there is no righteousness, there is poverty. Where there is righteousness, there is order; where there is no righteousness, there is chaos. Thus, Heaven desires life and detests death, desires wealth and detests poverty, desires order and detests chaos. This is how we know that Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness.\n\nFurthermore, righteousness is governance. Governance does not flow from below to above; it must flow from above to below. Thus, the common people exhaust their strength in service, yet before they can govern themselves, the officers govern them. The officers exhaust their strength in service, yet before they can govern themselves, the generals and ministers govern them. The generals and ministers exhaust their strength in service, yet before they can govern themselves, the Three Dukes and feudal lords govern them. The Three Dukes and feudal lords exhaust their strength in governance, yet before they can govern themselves, the Son of Heaven governs them. And before the Son of Heaven can govern himself, Heaven governs him. The Son of Heaven governs the Three Dukes, feudal lords, officers, and common people. The scholar-gentlemen of the world clearly understand that Heaven governs the Son of Heaven, yet the people of the world do not clearly understand this.\n\nThus, in ancient times, the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—wished to make clear to the people of the world that Heaven governs the Son of Heaven. Therefore, none failed to groom oxen and sheep, raise dogs and pigs, prepare pure grain and sweet wine, and offer sacrifices to the Supreme Lord and spirits, seeking blessings from Heaven. I have never heard of the people of the world seeking blessings from the Son of Heaven. This is how I know that Heaven governs the Son of Heaven.\n\nTherefore, the Son of Heaven is the most exalted and wealthiest in the world. Thus, those who desire wealth and exaltation must align with the will of Heaven and cannot but comply. Those who comply with the will of Heaven—practicing universal love and mutual benefit—will surely receive reward. Those who defy the will of Heaven—practicing mutual hatred and harm—will surely receive punishment.\n\nNow then, who has complied with the will of Heaven and received reward? Who has defied it and received punishment? Master Mozi said: The sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—complied with the will of Heaven and received reward. The tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—defied the will of Heaven and received punishment.\n\nNow, why did Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu receive reward? Master Mozi said: They served Heaven above, served the spirits in the middle, and loved the people below. Thus, the will of Heaven said: \"These are those whom I love—I love them universally. These are those whom I benefit—I benefit them universally.\" Those who love others do so broadly; those who benefit others do so deeply. Therefore, they were made noble as Sons of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven, and their legacy endured for ten thousand generations. Their goodness was proclaimed, spreading throughout the world, and to this day they are called sage-kings.\n\nNow, why did Jie, Zhou, You, and Li receive punishment? Master Mozi said: They reviled Heaven above, deceived the spirits in the middle, and despised the people below. Thus, the will of Heaven said: \"These are those whom I love—I detest them separately. These are those whom I benefit—I harm them mutually.\" Those who detest others do so broadly; those who harm others do so deeply. Therefore, they did not complete their allotted years, their dynasties were cut short, and to this day they are reviled as tyrannical kings.\n\nNow, how do we know that Heaven loves the people of the world? Because it illuminates them universally. How do we know it illuminates them universally? Because it possesses them universally. How do we know it possesses them universally? Because it nourishes them universally. How do we know it nourishes them universally? It is said: Within the four seas, all who eat grain—none fail to groom oxen and sheep, raise dogs and pigs, prepare pure grain and sweet wine, and offer sacrifices to the Supreme Lord and spirits.\n\nHeaven possesses the people—how could it not love them? Moreover, I say that killing even one innocent person must bring one inauspicious consequence. Who kills the innocent? It is man. To whom does the inauspicious consequence belong? It is Heaven. If one claims that Heaven does not love the people of the world, then why does Heaven bring inauspicious consequences when men kill one another? This is how I know that Heaven loves the people of the world.\n\nThose who follow the will of Heaven practice governance through righteousness. Those who oppose the will of Heaven practice governance through force. But how is righteous governance to be achieved? Master Mozi says: A great state does not attack small states; a powerful family does not usurp humble families. The strong do not plunder the weak; the noble do not despise the lowly; the cunning do not deceive the foolish. This must benefit Heaven above, spirits in the middle, and men below. With threefold benefit, nothing is not benefited, so the finest names under Heaven are bestowed upon them—they are called sagely kings.\n\nThose who practice governance through force are the opposite: their words contradict this, their actions oppose it, like reckless charioteers. A great state attacks small states; a powerful family usurps humble families. The strong plunder the weak; the noble despise and oppress; the cunning deceive the foolish. This does not benefit Heaven above, spirits in the middle, or men below. With threefold harm, nothing is benefited, so the vilest names under Heaven are bestowed upon them—they are called tyrannical kings.\n\nMaster Mozi says: I possess the will of Heaven, like a wheelwright’s compass or a carpenter’s square. The wheelwright and carpenter hold their compass and square to measure the square and round of all under Heaven, saying: what conforms is right, what does not conform is wrong.\n\nNow, the books of the gentlemen and knights of the world cannot be fully recorded, their words cannot be fully counted. They persuade rulers above and persuade officials below, yet in matters of benevolence and righteousness, they are far indeed. How do I know this? I say: I have obtained the luminous standard of all under Heaven to measure them.\n\n**Heaven’s Will, Part Twenty-Seven**\nMaster Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who wish to practice benevolence and righteousness must not fail to examine the source of righteousness. Since one cannot but examine the source of righteousness, then from where does righteousness arise? Master Mozi says: Righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly; it must arise from the noble and wise. How do I know that righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly, but must arise from the noble and wise? I say: Righteousness is good governance. How do I know that righteousness is good governance? I say: When the world has righteousness, it is ordered; when it lacks righteousness, it is chaotic. Thus I know that righteousness is good governance. The foolish and lowly cannot govern the noble and wise; only after the noble and wise govern can they govern the foolish and lowly. This is how I know that righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly, but must arise from the noble and wise.\n\nThen who is noble? Who is wise? I say: Heaven is noble, Heaven is wise—nothing more. Thus righteousness indeed arises from Heaven.\n\nNow, the people of the world say: The Son of Heaven is nobler than the feudal lords, and the feudal lords are nobler than the great officials—this is clear and evident. Yet I do not know whether Heaven is nobler and wiser than the Son of Heaven. Master Mozi says: I know that Heaven is nobler and wiser than the Son of Heaven. How? When the Son of Heaven does good, Heaven can reward him. When the Son of Heaven is tyrannical, Heaven can punish him. When the Son of Heaven suffers illness or misfortune, he must fast, bathe, and purify himself, prepare pure grain and sweet wine, and offer sacrifices to Heaven and the spirits—then Heaven can remove his afflictions. Yet I do not know whether Heaven seeks blessings for the Son of Heaven. This is how I know that Heaven is nobler and wiser than the Son of Heaven, and it is not only this.\n\nI also know it from the way of the *Xun Tian Ming Bu Jie* in the books of the former kings, which says: \"The luminous and wise, great indeed, oversee the ruler and issue commands below.\" This speaks of Heaven’s nobility and wisdom over the Son of Heaven. Is there anyone else who is noble and wise besides Heaven? I say: Heaven is noble, Heaven is wise—nothing more. Thus righteousness indeed arises from Heaven.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who truly wish to honor the Dao and benefit the people, who seek to examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, must not fail to be cautious of Heaven’s will. Since one must be cautious of Heaven’s will, then what does Heaven desire and what does it detest? Master Mozi says: Heaven’s will does not desire great states to attack small states, or powerful families to disrupt humble families. It does not desire the strong to oppress the few, the cunning to scheme against the foolish, or the noble to despise the lowly—these are what Heaven does not desire. Beyond this, it desires that people use their strength to assist one another, use their Dao to teach one another, and share their wealth with one another. It also desires that rulers diligently listen to governance and that subjects diligently attend to their tasks. If rulers diligently listen to governance, the state will be well-ordered. If subjects diligently attend to their tasks, resources will be sufficient. If the state is well-ordered and resources are sufficient, then internally, there will be pure wine and sweet grain to offer sacrifices to Heaven and the spirits; externally, there will be jade rings and pearls to present to neighboring states. The grievances of feudal lords will not arise, and weapons will not be raised at the borders. Internally, there will be means to feed the hungry and rest the weary, to nourish the myriad people—then ruler and minister, above and below, will be kind and loyal; father and son, elder and younger brother, will be compassionate and filial.\n\nThus, only by clearly understanding and following Heaven’s will, and broadly implementing it throughout the world, will governance be well-ordered, the people harmonious, the state prosperous, and resources abundant. The hundred clans will all have warm clothes and full bellies, living in comfort without worry. Therefore, Master Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who truly wish to follow the Dao and benefit the people, who seek to examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, must not fail to be cautious of Heaven’s will.\n\nMoreover, the Son of Heaven’s possession of the world differs in no way from the feudal lords’ possession of their territories within their four borders. Now, do the feudal lords desire that their ministers, states, and myriad people bring harm upon one another within their four borders? Yet if one dwells in a great state and attacks small states, or dwells in a great house and disrupts small households, seeking thereby to gain rewards and praise, such things shall never be attained—punishments and penalties will surely come. The Heavenly realm’s possession of the world is no different in this regard. If one dwells in a great state and attacks small states, or dwells in a great capital and assaults lesser cities, seeking thereby to obtain blessings and emoluments from Heaven, such blessings and emoluments shall never be attained—calamities and misfortunes will surely come. Now, if one does what Heaven does not desire and fails to do what Heaven desires, then Heaven, too, shall not do what people desire but shall do what people do not desire.\n\nWhat is it that people do not desire? It is sickness, suffering, and misfortune. If one does not do what Heaven desires but does what Heaven does not desire, this is to lead the myriad people of the world into the midst of calamity and misfortune. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity clearly knew what Heaven and the spirits bless and what they abhor, and so they sought to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm. Therefore, Heaven’s cold and heat were moderated, the four seasons harmonized, yin and yang, rain and dew timely; the five grains ripened, the six livestock thrived, and illness, plague, pestilence, famine, and disaster did not arise.\n\nThus, Master Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who truly wish to follow the Way and benefit the people, who seek to examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, must not fail to be cautious of Heaven’s will.\n\nMoreover, in the world there are those who are deemed unbenevolent and inauspicious, such as sons who do not serve their fathers, younger brothers who do not serve their elder brothers, and ministers who do not serve their rulers. The gentlemen of the world call these inauspicious. Yet Heaven encompasses all under Heaven and loves them, nurturing the myriad things to benefit them—even to the tip of a hair—so that the people may obtain and enjoy these benefits. Can this be called otherwise? Yet they alone fail to repay Heaven and do not recognize this as unbenevolent and inauspicious. This is what I call the gentleman’s clarity in small matters but blindness in great ones.\n\nFurthermore, I know that Heaven’s love for the people is profound, for it has established the sun, moon, and stars to illuminate and guide them; ordained the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—to order and regulate them; sent down thunder, snow, frost, rain, and dew to make the five grains and hemp grow, enabling the people to obtain and profit from them; arrayed mountains, rivers, streams, and valleys to distribute the hundred affairs; and oversees the people’s good and evil, appointing kings, dukes, marquises, and earls to reward the worthy and punish the violent. It has provided metals, wood, birds, and beasts for the cultivation of the five grains and hemp, to serve as the people’s clothing and food. From antiquity to the present, this has never ceased. Now, if there were a man here who loved his child as tenderly as this, exhausting his strength and single-minded devotion to benefit him.\n\nWhen this child grows up and offers no repayment to the father who sought his benefit, all the noble men under Heaven would call him unfilial and inauspicious. Now, the Dao of Heaven embraces all under Heaven and loves them, nurturing the myriad things to benefit them—even to the finest hair’s tip—yet if it were not for Heaven’s work, the people could not obtain these benefits, and this would be deemed wrong. Yet they alone offer no repayment to Heaven and do not recognize this as unfilial and inauspicious. This is what I mean when I say that noble men perceive the small but fail to perceive the great.\n\nMoreover, my proof that Heaven loves the people deeply is not limited to this alone. It is said: “He who kills the innocent, Heaven bestows misfortune upon him.” Who are the innocent? They are the people. Who bestows misfortune? It is Heaven. If Heaven did not love the people deeply, why would it declare that those who kill the innocent will be visited with misfortune by Heaven? This is how I know that Heaven loves the people deeply.\n\nFurthermore, my proof that Heaven loves the people deeply is not limited to this alone. It is said: Those who love and benefit others, aligning with Heaven’s intent, receive Heaven’s rewards. Those who hate and harm others, defying Heaven’s intent, receive Heaven’s punishments. Who are those who love and benefit others, aligning with Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s rewards? They are the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties: Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. What did Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu practice? They practiced inclusiveness, not partiality. Inclusiveness means: a great state does not attack a small state, a great family does not disrupt a small family, the strong do not plunder the weak, the many do not oppress the few, the cunning do not deceive the simple, and the noble do not disdain the humble. Observing their deeds, they benefited Heaven above, spirits in the middle, and people below. With these threefold benefits, nothing was left unbenefited—this is called the virtue of Heaven. They gathered the finest reputations of all under Heaven and bestowed them upon these kings, saying: “This is benevolence, this is righteousness—loving and benefiting others, aligning with Heaven’s intent, and receiving Heaven’s rewards.” Not only this, but their deeds were inscribed on bamboo and silk, engraved on metal and stone, carved on plates and basins, and transmitted to later generations of descendants. What was the purpose? To record those who loved and benefited others, aligned with Heaven’s intent, and received Heaven’s rewards.\n\nThe *Huang Yi* states: “The Lord said to King Wen, ‘I cherish your luminous virtue. You do not raise your voice or change your countenance, nor do you alter the seasons with harsh measures. Unknowing and unperceiving, you follow the Lord’s principles.’” The Lord approved of his compliance with the law and principles, so He raised Yin to reward him, making him noble as the Son of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven, and his fame endures to this day. Thus, those who love and benefit others, aligning with Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s rewards, have left a lasting legacy.\n\nWho are those who hate and harm others, defying Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s punishments? They are the violent kings of the Three Dynasties: Jie, Zhou, You, and Li. What did Jie, Zhou, You, and Li practice? They practiced partiality, not inclusiveness. Partiality means: a great state attacks a small state, a great family disrupts a small family, the strong plunder the weak, the many oppress the few, the cunning deceive the simple, and the noble disdain the humble. Observing their deeds, they did not benefit Heaven above, spirits in the middle, or people below. With these threefold harms, nothing was left unharmed—this is called the bane of Heaven. They gathered the vilest reputations of all under Heaven and bestowed them upon these kings, saying: “This is not benevolence, not righteousness—hating and harming others, defying Heaven’s intent, and receiving Heaven’s punishments.” Not only this, but their deeds were also inscribed on bamboo and silk, engraved on metal and stone, carved on plates and basins, and transmitted to later generations of descendants. What was the purpose? To record those who hated and harmed others, defied Heaven’s intent, and received Heaven’s punishments.\n\nThe *Da Ming* states: “Zhou exceeded his proper bounds and dwelling, refusing to serve the Supreme Lord, abandoning the spirits of his ancestors and neglecting their sacrifices. He declared, ‘I have fate; there is no need for toil.’” Thus, Heaven also abandoned Zhou and did not protect him. That Heaven abandoned Zhou and did not protect him was because he defied Heaven’s intent. Thus, those who hate and harm others, defying Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s punishments, are clearly known.\n\nTherefore, Master Mo’s understanding of Heaven is no different from a wheelwright’s compass or a carpenter’s square. Now, if a wheelwright holds his compass to measure the roundness or lack thereof in all under Heaven, he says: “What aligns with my compass is round; what does not align is not round.” Thus, roundness and lack thereof can both be known. Why is this? Because the standard for roundness is clear. Likewise, a carpenter holds his square to measure the squareness or lack thereof in all under Heaven, saying: “What aligns with my square is square; what does not align is not square.” Thus, squareness and lack thereof can both be known. Why is this? Because the standard for squareness is clear.\n\nThus, Master Mo’s grasp of Heaven’s intent serves above to measure the governance of the kings, dukes, and great ministers of the world, and below to gauge the literary pursuits and spoken discourses of the myriad people. Observe their conduct: that which aligns with Heaven’s intent is called virtuous conduct; that which defies Heaven’s intent is called unvirtuous and wrong. Observe their discourses: that which aligns with Heaven’s intent is called virtuous discourse; that which defies Heaven’s intent is called unvirtuous discourse. Observe their governance: that which aligns with Heaven’s intent is called virtuous governance; that which defies Heaven’s intent is called unvirtuous governance. Therefore, establish this as the standard, set this as the model, and use it to measure the benevolence or lack thereof in the kings, dukes, great ministers, and high officials of the world—it is as clear as distinguishing black from white.\n\nHence, Master Mo says: Now, if the kings, dukes, great ministers, and gentlemen of the world truly wish to follow the Dao to benefit the people and examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, they cannot but align with Heaven’s intent. Aligning with Heaven’s intent is the standard of righteousness.\n\n**Heaven’s Will, Part Twenty-Eight**\nMaster Mo said: What is the cause of the world’s chaos? It is that the gentlemen of the world are clear about minor matters but unclear about major ones. How do we know they are clear about minor matters but unclear about major ones? Because they are unclear about Heaven’s intent. How do we know they are unclear about Heaven’s intent? Consider how people conduct themselves in households. If one living in another’s household commits an offense, there are still other households to flee to for refuge. Yet fathers warn their sons, elder brothers warn their younger brothers, saying: “Be cautious, be prudent! Living in another’s household, if you are not cautious and prudent, how much more so when living in another’s state?” Now, if one living in another’s state commits an offense, there are still other states to flee to for refuge. Yet fathers warn their sons, elder brothers warn their younger brothers, saying: “Be cautious, be prudent! Living in another’s state, one cannot but be cautious and prudent.” Now, all people dwell in the world and serve Heaven. If they offend Heaven, there is nowhere to flee for refuge. Yet none know to admonish one another—this is how I know they are ignorant of great matters.\n\nThus, Master Mo says: Be cautious, be prudent! You must do what Heaven desires and abandon what Heaven detests. What does Heaven desire? What does it detest? Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness. How do we know this? Righteousness is correctness. How do we know righteousness is correctness? When the world has righteousness, it is ordered; without righteousness, it is chaotic. Thus, I know righteousness is correctness. Yet correctness does not arise from below to correct what is above; it must arise from above to correct what is below. Therefore, commoners cannot correct themselves without being ordered by scholars; scholars cannot correct themselves without being ordered by great officers; great officers cannot correct themselves without being ordered by feudal lords; feudal lords cannot correct themselves without being ordered by the Three Dukes; the Three Dukes cannot correct themselves without being ordered by the Son of Heaven; and the Son of Heaven cannot govern himself without being ordered by Heaven. Now, the gentlemen of the world all understand that the Son of Heaven corrects the world but do not understand that Heaven corrects the Son of Heaven.\n\nThus, the sages of old explained to people: If the Son of Heaven does good, Heaven can reward him. If the Son of Heaven commits wrongs, Heaven can punish him. If the Son of Heaven’s rewards and punishments are unjust or his judgments unfair, the world suffers from plagues, disasters, untimely frost, and dew. The Son of Heaven must then fast, rear pure oxen, sheep, and dogs, prepare refined grain offerings and sweet wine, and pray to Heaven for blessings. I have never heard of Heaven praying to the Son of Heaven for blessings—this is how I know Heaven is weightier and more venerable than the Son of Heaven. Therefore, righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly but must arise from the noble and wise. Who is wise? Heaven is wise. Thus, righteousness truly arises from Heaven.\n\nNow, if the gentlemen of the world wish to practice righteousness, they cannot but align with Heaven’s intent. What does aligning with Heaven’s intent entail? It entails universally loving the people of the world. How do we know it entails universally loving the people of the world? Because it entails universally nourishing them. How do we know it entails universally nourishing them? From ancient times to the present, there has been no distant or isolated land where people do not rear pure oxen, sheep, and dogs, prepare refined grain offerings and sweet wine, and reverently sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, mountains, rivers, and spirits—this is how I know they universally nourish them. If they universally nourish them, they must universally love them. It is like the rulers of Chu and Yue: if the King of Chu nourishes only those within his four borders, he loves only the people of Chu; but now Heaven nourishes the entire world, so I know it universally loves the people of the world.\n\nMoreover, Heaven’s love for the people does not stop at material things. Now, in the states of the world where people consume grain, killing an innocent person is deemed inauspicious. Who kills the innocent? People do. Who bestows innocence? Heaven does. If Heaven truly did not love these people, why would it deem killing the innocent inauspicious and bestow misfortune upon the killer? Indeed, Heaven’s love for the people is profound and distinct—this can be known. How do we know Heaven loves the people? I know it because the worthy invariably reward the good and punish the violent. How do we know the worthy invariably reward the good and punish the violent? I know it from the sagely kings of the Three Dynasties of old.\n\nThus, the sagely kings of the Three Dynasties—Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—universally loved the world. Following this, they brought benefit to it, transforming the hearts of the people and leading them to revere the Supreme Lord, the mountains and rivers, and the ghosts and spirits. Heaven, seeing that they loved what it loved and benefited what it benefited, bestowed rewards upon them, placing them in high positions, establishing them as the Sons of Heaven to serve as models, and naming them \"sages.\" This serves as evidence of their rewarding the good.\n\nTherefore, the tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—universally harmed the world. Following this, they plundered it, corrupting the hearts of the people and leading them to revile and insult the Supreme Lord, the mountains and rivers, and the ghosts and spirits. Heaven, seeing that they did not love what it loved and harmed what it benefited, imposed punishments upon them, causing their fathers and sons to scatter, their states to perish, their altars of soil and grain to be lost, and their own persons to suffer misfortune. Thus, the common people of the world united in condemning them, and for ten thousand generations, their descendants continued to revile them without cease. They were named \"failed kings.\" This serves as evidence of their punishing the violent.\n\nNow, if the scholar-officials of the world wish to practice righteousness, they must not fail to align with the will of Heaven. It is said: aligning with the will of Heaven is universality; opposing the will of Heaven is partiality. Universality as a Way is righteous rectitude; partiality as a Way is forceful rectitude.\n\nIt is asked: What is righteous rectitude?\nIt is said: The great do not attack the small; the strong do not bully the weak; the many do not plunder the few; the cunning do not deceive the foolish; the noble do not disdain the humble; the rich do not arrogantly scorn the poor; the robust do not seize from the aged. Thus, among the various states of the world, none would use water, fire, poison, or weapons to harm one another. In serving above, this benefits Heaven; in the middle, it benefits the spirits; below, it benefits the people. With threefold benefit and nothing unbenefited, this is called the virtue of Heaven. Therefore, all who act in accordance with this are sagely and wise, humane and righteous, loyal and kind, compassionate and filial. For this reason, they gather all the world’s good names and are adorned with them.\n\nWhy is this so? It is because they align with the will of Heaven.\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is meant by *forceful rectitude*?\"\nThe answer: The great attack the small; the strong bully the weak; the many plunder the few; the cunning deceive the foolish; the noble disdain the humble; the rich arrogantly scorn the poor; the robust seize from the aged. Thus, among the various states of the world, all employ water, fire, poison, and weapons to harm one another. In serving above, this does not benefit Heaven; in the middle, it does not benefit the spirits; below, it does not benefit the people. With threefold harm and nothing benefited, this is called *banditry*. Therefore, all who act in accordance with this are rebels and usurpers, thieves and robbers, inhumane and unrighteous, disloyal and unkind, uncompassionate and unfilial. For this reason, they gather all the world’s evil names and are burdened with them.\n\nWhy is this so? It is because they oppose the will of Heaven.\n\nThus, Master Mozi established the will of Heaven as a standard, like a wheelwright’s compass or a carpenter’s square. Now, wheelwrights use compasses and carpenters use squares to distinguish between round and square. Therefore, Master Mozi established the will of Heaven as a standard, by which I know how far the gentlemen and nobles of the world have strayed from *rightness*.\n\nHow do I know they have strayed so far from *rightness*? Consider this: when the lord of a great state is lenient, he says, \"I rule a great state, yet I do not attack small states—how then can I be great?\" Thus, he selects his most cunning advisors, assembles his chariots and troops, and attacks blameless states. They breach their borders, reap their crops, fell their trees, and destroy their city walls to fortify their own moats. They burn ancestral temples and slaughter sacrificial animals. Those who resist are violently seized, while those who do not are bound and taken away. The men are made into servants and laborers, the women into millers and cooks. Yet these lords who delight in conquest do not recognize this as inhumane and unrighteous; instead, they boast to neighboring lords, saying, \"I have attacked a state, crushed an army, and slain so many generals!\" The neighboring lords, likewise unaware that this is inhumane and unrighteous, prepare gifts of furs and silk, dispatch envoys, and offer congratulations. Thus, these lords who delight in conquest, though they do not recognize this as inhumane and unrighteous, record their deeds on bamboo and silk and store them in their archives. Their descendants, wishing to follow their ancestors’ ways, will say, \"Why not open our archives and admire our forebears’ glorious methods?\" They will not say, \"These were the ways of Wen and Wu, the true *rectitude*.\" Instead, they will say, \"I have attacked a state, crushed an army, and slain so many generals!\" Thus, these lords who delight in conquest do not recognize this as inhumane and unrighteous, nor do their neighboring lords. This is why conquest continues unceasingly, generation after generation. This is what I mean when I say they do not recognize great matters.\n\nBut what of small matters? If someone were to enter another’s garden and take their peaches, plums, melons, or ginger, they would be punished upon discovery, and the crowd would condemn them. Why? Because they reap the fruits of another’s labor, taking what is not theirs. How much worse, then, is it to breach another’s walls, seize their sons and daughters, plunder their treasuries, steal their gold, jade, silk, and fine fabrics, or burn their stables and steal their cattle and horses? How much worse is it to kill even one innocent person?\n\nYet when kings, dukes, and great officials govern, if someone kills an innocent person, breaches another’s walls, seizes their sons and daughters, plunders their treasuries, steals their gold, jade, silk, and fine fabrics, or burns their stables and steals their cattle and horses—or even steals peaches, plums, melons, or ginger—they mete out punishments no different from those of the ancient sage-kings Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. Yet today, the lords of the world still invade, attack, and annex one another, killing thousands upon thousands of innocent people. They breach walls, seize sons and daughters, plunder treasuries, steal gold, jade, silk, and fine fabrics, burn stables, steal cattle and horses, and take peaches, plums, melons, and ginger—all by the thousands upon thousands. And they call this *rightness*!\n\nThus, Master Mozi said: \"Those who reproach me for this are no different from those who cannot distinguish between black and white or sweet and bitter.\" Consider this: if someone were shown a little black and called it black, but shown much black and called it white, they would say, \"My eyes are confused; I cannot tell black from white.\" Or if someone tasted a little sweetness and called it sweet, but tasted much and called it bitter, they would say, \"My mouth is confused; I cannot tell sweet from bitter.\" Yet when kings and great officials govern, if someone kills a person in their own state, they punish it. But if someone kills many people in a neighboring state, they call it *civilized rightness*—how is this different from confusing black and white or sweet and bitter?\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi established the will of Heaven as a standard. It is not only Master Mozi who took the will of Heaven as a model; the *Way of Great Xia* in the books of the former kings states: \"The Lord said to King Wen, 'I cherish and make bright your virtue. Do not be loud in voice or harsh in countenance; do not prolong summer with change. Act without cunning, without knowledge, following the patterns of the Lord.'\" This is how the proclamation instructed King Wen to take the will of Heaven as a model and follow the patterns of the Lord.\n\nNow, if the gentlemen and nobles of the world truly wish to practice *humaneness* and *rightness*, to become superior men, to uphold the *Way* of the sage-kings above and benefit their states and people below, they cannot fail to examine the will of Heaven.\n\nThe will of Heaven is the warp of *rightness*. Now, the gentlemen of the world who discuss *rightness* often say: \"If one possesses wealth and nobility, then one may establish *rightness*.\" Yet this is not the *rightness* that Heaven desires. Heaven desires those who love others and benefit others; it does not desire those who harm others and rob others. Moreover, how can it be that those who possess wealth and nobility alone may establish *rightness*?\n\nConsider this: when Heaven sends down its seasons, it does not favor the great states over the small, nor the noble over the humble. It bestows its *virtue* and *power* equally upon the wise ruler and the foolish ruler alike. Now, if one wishes to love others and benefit others, to practice *humaneness* and *rightness*, one cannot but take the will of Heaven as a model.\n\nFor what does Heaven desire, and what does it detest? Heaven desires *rightness* and detests *unrightness*. Thus, when one leads the people of the world to practice *rightness*, one is acting in accordance with the will of Heaven. When one acts in accordance with the will of Heaven, one is being filial toward Heaven. When one is filial toward Heaven, one is certain to be rewarded. When one leads the people of the world to practice *unrightness*, one is opposing the will of Heaven. When one opposes the will of Heaven, one is being unfilial toward Heaven. When one is unfilial toward Heaven, one is certain to incur misfortune.\n\nNow, what does it mean to act in accordance with the will of Heaven? It means to love others without partiality and to benefit others without expectation. What is the origin of this? It lies in not attacking other states, not disturbing the people’s households, not killing the innocent. Where there is no attack on other states, no disturbance of the people’s households, no killing of the innocent, how can there be harm to others or robbery of others? How can there be those who possess wealth and nobility alone establishing *rightness*?\n\nThus, the will of Heaven is the warp of *rightness*. The gentleman who wishes to practice *rightness* cannot but examine the will of Heaven.\n\n**Mozi, Book Eight**\n**Chapter Thirty: \"On Ghosts, Part Two\"**\n**Chapter Thirty-One: \"On Ghosts, Part Three\"**\n\nMozi said: When the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties passed away, the world lost its *rightness*, and the feudal lords relied on force to rule. Thus, rulers and ministers, superiors and inferiors ceased to act with kindness and loyalty; fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers ceased to act with compassion, filial piety, brotherly respect, integrity, and goodness. Governors failed to exert themselves in hearing and administering governance, while the common people failed to exert themselves in their labors. The people turned to licentiousness, violence, banditry, and theft, using weapons, poison, water, and fire to harm the innocent on roads and paths, seizing others’ carriages, horses, clothes, and furs for their own gain—all these evils arose from this. Hence, the world fell into chaos.\n\nWhat was the reason for this? It was because people doubted the existence of ghosts and spirits and did not understand that ghosts and spirits reward the worthy and punish the violent. If today the people of the world truly believed that ghosts and spirits reward the worthy and punish the violent, how could the world be in chaos?\n\nThose who deny the existence of ghosts say: \"Ghosts and spirits simply do not exist.\" Day and night, they teach this to the world, causing the multitudes to doubt whether ghosts and spirits exist or not. This is why the world is in chaos.\n\nTherefore, Mozi said: If the kings, dukes, ministers, and gentlemen of the world truly wish to seek what benefits the world and eliminate what harms it, they must not fail to examine whether ghosts and spirits exist or not. Since it is clear that this matter cannot be left unexamined, how then should we investigate it?\n\nMozi said: The way to determine the existence or non-existence of ghosts and spirits must be based on the actual knowledge of the multitude—what they have heard and seen. Those who have not heard or seen them may claim they do not exist. But why not inquire in every village and hamlet, from ancient times to the present, since the beginning of human life? Have there ever been those who have seen the forms of ghosts and spirits or heard their voices? If so, how can one say ghosts and spirits do not exist? If no one has heard or seen them, then can one say they do exist?\n\nThose who deny the existence of ghosts say: \"The number of those in the world who claim to have heard or seen ghosts and spirits is beyond counting. But who has truly heard or seen the forms of ghosts and spirits?\"\n\nMozi said: If we rely on what the multitude has collectively seen and heard, then consider the case of Du Bo in ancient times. King Xuan of Zhou killed his minister Du Bo without just cause. Du Bo said: \"My lord has killed me without cause. If the dead are without knowledge, then let it be. But if the dead have knowledge, within three years, I will surely make my lord know it.\" Three years later, King Xuan of Zhou assembled the feudal lords for a hunt in the Pu Field. Hundreds of chariots followed, thousands of men filled the wilds. At midday, Du Bo, riding a white horse and a plain carriage, clad in red robes and cap, holding a red bow and red arrows, pursued King Xuan of Zhou. He shot an arrow into the king’s chariot, piercing his heart and breaking his spine. The king choked and died in his chariot. At that time, none of the Zhou followers present failed to see it, and none at a distance failed to hear of it. It was recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Zhou. Rulers used this to instruct their ministers, fathers to warn their sons, saying: \"Be cautious, be vigilant! Those who kill the innocent will not escape misfortune. The schemes of ghosts and spirits are swift and relentless!\" Judging by this account, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nNot only does this account attest to it, but consider also the case of Duke Mu of Zheng. One day at noon, while he was in the ancestral temple, a spirit entered through the left side of the gate. It had the body of a crow, wore plain white garments with three sashes, and its face was square. Duke Mu of Zheng saw it and was terrified, trembling. The spirit said: \"The Lord on High has enjoyed your bright virtue and grants you a lifespan of nineteen years. He will make your state prosperous, your descendants flourish, and ensure you do not lose your position.\" Duke Mu bowed twice and touched his head to the ground, saying: \"May I ask who you are?\" The spirit replied: \"I am Gou Mang.\" If we take Duke Mu’s personal encounter as evidence, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nNot only do these accounts attest to it, but consider also the case of Duke Jian of Yan, who killed his minister Zhuang Ziyi without just cause. Zhuang Ziyi said: \"My lord has killed me without cause. If the dead are without knowledge, then let it be. But if the dead have knowledge, within three years, I will surely make my lord know it.\" A year later, Duke Jian of Yan was about to hold the ancestral chariot race. The Yan ancestral race was as grand as the sacrifices to the altars of soil and grain in Qi, the mulberry groves in Song, and the Cloud Dream Marsh in Chu—an occasion where men and women gathered to watch. At midday, as Duke Jian was about to race on the ancestral path, Zhuang Ziyi, carrying a red staff, struck him and pinned him to his chariot. At that time, none of the Yan followers present failed to see it, and none at a distance failed to hear of it. It was recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Yan. The feudal lords transmitted the account, saying: \"Those who kill the innocent will not escape misfortune. The punishments of ghosts and spirits are swift and relentless!\" Judging by this account, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nNot only do these accounts attest to it, but consider also the time of Duke Wen of Song, when there was a minister named Gu Gu. Once, while performing a sacrifice, the sacrificial victim was led out with a staff. The spirit addressed Gu Gu, saying: \"Gu Gu, why are the jade disks and ritual vessels not filled to the proper measure? Why are the wine and sweet liquor not pure, the music and offerings not solemn? Why are the sacrificial animals not whole and fat? Why are the spring, autumn, winter, and summer sacrifices not performed at the proper times? Is this your doing, or is it Duke Wen’s?\" Gu Gu replied: \"Duke Wen is young and weak, still in swaddling clothes. How could he know of these matters?\"\n\nThe official minister Gu Gu alone bore the responsibility for this. The spirit raised its staff and struck him, slaying him upon the altar. At that moment, none among the attending Song people failed to witness it, and none at a distance failed to hear of it—it was recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Song. The feudal lords transmitted the account, declaring: \"Those who are not reverent and cautious in sacrifices—such is the relentless punishment of ghosts and spirits!\" Judging by this account, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nNot only does this account attest to it, but consider also the time of Duke Zhuang of Qi, when there were two men named Wang Liguo and Zhongli Jiao. These two had been litigating for three years, yet the case remained unresolved. The Duke of Qi, hesitant to execute them for fear of wrongful punishment, was equally hesitant to acquit them for fear of letting the guilty go free. Thus, he had them share a sheep and swear an oath at the altar of the state’s spirit. Both men agreed. Thereupon, they dug a pit, slaughtered the sheep, and sprinkled its blood. As the oath of Wang Liguo was being recited to its end, and the oath of Zhongli Che had only reached its midpoint, the sheep suddenly rose and gored him, breaking his leg. The spirit then struck him with a peachwood staff, slaying him at the oath-taking site. At that moment, none among the attending Qi people failed to witness it, and none at a distance failed to hear of it—it was recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Qi. The feudal lords transmitted the account, declaring: \"Those who first make false oaths—such is the relentless punishment of ghosts and spirits!\" Judging by this account, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nThus, Master Mozi said: \"Even in the deepest ravines, the vastest forests, the most secluded valleys—places where no man dwells—one must still act with utmost caution, for ghosts and spirits observe all.\" Now, those who deny the existence of ghosts say: \"How can the perceptions of the common people’s ears and eyes suffice to resolve such doubts?\" How then do they aspire to be esteemed gentlemen of the world while dismissing the testimony of the multitude’s ears and eyes?\n\nMaster Mozi replied: \"If the perceptions of the multitude’s ears and eyes are deemed untrustworthy and insufficient to resolve doubts, then do not the ancient sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—serve as proper models?\" Indeed, from those of average understanding upward, all would say: \"The ancient sage-kings of the Three Dynasties are worthy models.\" If the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties are truly worthy models, then let us examine their deeds. When King Wu attacked Yin and executed Zhou, he had the feudal lords divide the sacrifices, saying: \"Let the close kin receive the inner sacrifices, and the distant kin receive the outer sacrifices.\" Thus, King Wu must have believed in the existence of ghosts and spirits, for when he attacked Yin and executed Zhou, he had the feudal lords divide the sacrifices. If ghosts and spirits did not exist, why would King Wu have divided the sacrifices?\n\nNor was this true only of King Wu’s deeds. All sage-kings, when bestowing rewards, did so at the ancestral temple, and when executing punishments, did so at the altar of the soil. Why bestow rewards at the ancestral temple? To announce that the distribution was just. Why execute punishments at the altar of the soil? To announce that the judgment was impartial.\n\nNot only do the records speak thus, but moreover, the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou—when first establishing their states and building their capitals, each day would select the land’s central altar to establish as the ancestral temple. They would choose the tallest and most luxuriant trees to erect as the sacred altars. They would select the state’s most filial, virtuous, and upright elders to serve as invocators and ancestral masters. They would choose the finest, fattest, and most robust of the six livestock to serve as sacrificial victims. Jade tablets, bi-disks, and huang-ornaments were measured by wealth to determine their scale. They would select the most fragrant and golden of the five grains to prepare as wine, sweet liquor, and sacrificial offerings, so that the wine, sweet liquor, and grain offerings would rise and fall with the harvest’s abundance.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings in governing the world necessarily placed ghosts and spirits before men—this was their way. Therefore, it is said: the selection of officials and the examination of their merits came first; sacrificial vessels and robes were all stored in the treasury; invocators, ancestral masters, and their attendants were all appointed in the court; sacrificial victims were not kept with the common herds. Thus did the ancient sage-kings administer governance.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings made the service of ghosts and spirits their paramount duty, for ghosts and spirits are of profound importance. Yet they feared that later generations and descendants would fail to understand this, so they inscribed it on bamboo and silk to transmit to posterity. Still, they worried that these records might rot, decay, or vanish, leaving descendants without knowledge, so they carved them onto basins and bowls, engraved them on metal and stone, to lend them weight. They feared that later generations might fail to revere and uphold these teachings, so in the writings of the former kings, the sages—even a foot of silk or a single scroll—spoke repeatedly of the existence of ghosts and spirits, emphasizing it again and again.\n\nFor what reason? Because the sage-kings made this their duty.\n\nThose who insist there are no ghosts say: \"Ghosts and spirits simply do not exist.\" This directly contradicts the duty of the sage-kings. To contradict the duty of the sage-kings is not the Way of the true noble person. Now, those who insist there are no ghosts say: \"In the writings of the former kings, there is not a foot of silk or a single scroll that speaks repeatedly of the existence of ghosts and spirits, emphasizing it again and again—what texts record such things? What texts affirm them?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: The *Book of Zhou* in the *Greater Odes* contains this. The *Greater Odes* says:\n*\"King Wen is on high,\nOh, radiant in Heaven.\nThough Zhou is an ancient state,\nIts mandate is ever renewed.\nThe glory of Zhou is not dim,\nFor the Lord’s decree is timely.\nKing Wen ascends and descends,\nEver at the Lord’s side.\nReverent is King Wen,\nHis good name unceasing.\"*\nIf ghosts and spirits did not exist, how could King Wen, after death, remain at the Lord’s side? This is how I know the *Book of Zhou* affirms ghosts.\n\nYet if only the *Book of Zhou* spoke of ghosts while the *Book of Shang* did not, it would not suffice as a model. Let us then examine the *Book of Shang*, which says:\n*\"Alas! In ancient times, when the Xia dynasty had not yet brought disaster upon itself, the hundred beasts and creeping things, even the flying birds, all followed the proper order. The earthworms and the human-faced creatures—how dared they harbor rebellious hearts? The mountain and river spirits, too, dared not disturb the peace. If one could truly act with sincerity, this would bring harmony to all under Heaven and preserve the lands below.\"*\nConsider why the mountain and river spirits dared not disturb the peace: it was because they aided and counseled Yu. This is how I know the *Books of Shang and Zhou* affirm ghosts.\n\nYet if only the *Book of Yu* spoke of ghosts while the *Book of Xia* did not, it would not suffice as a model. Let us then examine the *Book of Xia*. The *Oath of Yu* says:\n*\"At the great battle of Gan, the king commanded six men at his side to descend and receive the oath in the central army, saying: ‘The House of Youhu has defied the Five Phases and abandoned the Three Norms. Heaven will cut off its mandate.’ He declared: ‘At high noon, today I contend with the House of Youhu for the fate of a single day. Now, you ministers, great officers, and common people, I do not seek your fields, lands, or treasures—I am carrying out Heaven’s punishment. If the left flank fails in its duty to the left, or the right flank fails in its duty to the right, it is a failure of command. If the charioteers do not govern their horses properly, it is a failure of command.’ Thus, rewards were given at the ancestral temple, and punishments were meted out at the altar of the soil. Why were rewards given at the ancestral temple? To show that the distribution of commands was just. Why were punishments meted out at the altar of the soil? To show that the judgment of cases was proper.\"*\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings necessarily used ghosts and spirits to reward the worthy and punish the violent. Therefore, rewards were always given at the ancestral temple, and punishments were always meted out at the altar of the soil. This is how I know the *Book of Xia* affirms ghosts.\n\nThus, the *Classic of Documents*—the *Book of Xia*, followed by the *Books of Shang and Zhou*—speaks repeatedly of the existence of ghosts and spirits, emphasizing it again and again. For what reason? Because the sage-kings made this their duty.\n\nJudging by the explanations in these texts, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted? In ancient times, on an auspicious day, the ding-mao day, the Zhou dynasty performed the sacrifice to the soil altar, annually offering to the spirits of the soil to prolong life and longevity. If there were no ghosts and spirits, how could such offerings prolong life and longevity?\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: If ghosts and spirits truly reward the worthy and punish the violent, this principle, when applied to the state and extended to the myriad people, is indeed the Way to govern the state and benefit the people. To deny this is to claim that when officials govern the courts and bureaus without purity or integrity, or when men and women disregard proper distinctions, ghosts and spirits witness it. When the people engage in licentiousness, violence, banditry, theft, or use weapons, poison, water, or fire to harm the innocent on the roads, or seize others’ carriages, horses, clothes, and furs for their own gain, ghosts and spirits observe it.\n\nThus, officials dare not govern the courts and bureaus without purity or integrity. They dare not fail to reward the good or punish the violent. The people dare not engage in licentiousness, violence, banditry, or theft, or use weapons, poison, water, or fire to harm the innocent on the roads, or seize others’ carriages, horses, clothes, and furs for their own gain. Such acts cease, and none dare transgress.\n\nIn the hidden and obscure, they emulate the clarity of ghosts and spirits. In the open and manifest, even a single person fears the judgment from above. Thus, all under Heaven is well-governed. The clarity of ghosts and spirits extends even to the hidden depths of broad marshes, mountain forests, and deep valleys—they surely know all. The punishments of ghosts and spirits cannot be evaded by wealth, nobility, great numbers, or strength, nor by martial prowess, sturdy armor, or sharp weapons—they will surely prevail.\n\nTo deny this, consider the past: King Jie of Xia, though he was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, reviled Heaven above and insulted the spirits, while below he brought calamity and arrogance upon the myriad people. He defied the August Lord and violated the great norms of the mountains and rivers. Thus, Heaven sent Tang to execute its bright punishment. Tang, with nine chariots in formation, advanced like a flock of crows, riding in great triumph. He charged through the masses, capturing and subduing the mighty Xi. Thus, though King Jie of Xia was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, though he had the mighty Xi, who could wrestle tigers and rhinoceroses and kill men with a gesture, though his people numbered in the millions and his warriors filled the marshes and mounds, he could not withstand the punishment of the spirits. This is what I mean when I say the punishments of ghosts and spirits cannot be evaded by wealth, nobility, great numbers, or strength, nor by martial prowess, sturdy armor, or sharp weapons.\n\nMoreover, this is not the only instance. King Zhou of Yin, though he was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, reviled Heaven above and insulted the spirits, while below he brought calamity and arrogance upon the myriad people. He cast aside the elderly, murdered children, cruelly tortured the innocent, and disemboweled pregnant women.\n\nThe widowed, orphaned, and destitute wailed in despair, with none to turn to. Thus, Heaven sent King Wu to execute its luminous punishment. With a hundred chariots of war and four hundred tiger-like warriors, he first dispatched envoys to observe the states and spy on the enemy, then joined battle with the men of Yin at the Wilds of Mu. The king captured Fei Zhong and E Lai, and the masses scattered in flight. King Wu pursued them into the palace, felled the thousand-year catalpa, broke Zhou’s body and bound it with red cords, then hoisted it upon a white banner as a warning to the feudal lords of the world.\n\nThus, though King Zhou of Yin was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, though he had mighty men like Fei Zhong, E Lai, and Chong Hou Hu who could point at the few and kill, though his people numbered in the millions and his warriors filled the marshes and mounds, he could not withstand the punishment of the spirits. This is what I mean when I say the punishments of ghosts and spirits cannot be evaded by wealth, nobility, great numbers, or strength, nor by martial prowess, sturdy armor, or sharp weapons.\n\nMoreover, the saying of the ancient sages goes: *\"Though the crime be small, destroy the clan; though the merit be slight, extinguish the lineage.\"* This means that what the ghosts and spirits reward, no matter how small, they will surely reward; what they punish, no matter how great, they will surely punish.\n\nNow, those who deny the existence of ghosts ask: *\"Do you mean to harm the interests of loyal kin and act against filial piety?\"* Master Mozi replied: *\"The ghosts of ancient and present times are none other than these: there are heavenly ghosts, ghosts of mountains and rivers, and those who become ghosts after death. Today, there are cases where sons die before their fathers, and younger brothers before their elder brothers. Though this may seem so, the common saying goes: 'The firstborn dies first.' If this is true, then those who die first are either fathers or mothers, elder brothers or sisters. Now, when we purify wine and millet, prepare offerings, and perform sacrifices with reverence, if ghosts and spirits truly exist, then we are feeding our parents, elder brothers, and sisters—is this not a great benefit? If ghosts and spirits do not exist, then we have merely wasted the wealth spent on wine, millet, and offerings. Yet even if we discard these into the ditches and ravines, within our clans and without in our villages, all may gather to share in the food and drink. Even if ghosts and spirits do not exist, this still serves to unite the people and foster goodwill among neighbors. Now, those who deny ghosts say: 'Ghosts and spirits do not exist at all,' and thus they refuse to share in the wealth spent on wine, millet, and sacrificial animals. Are they not simply hoarding these resources? What benefit do they gain? This contradicts the teachings of the sage kings, opposes the conduct of filial children among the people, and is no way to be a superior man in the world. Therefore, Master Mozi said: 'When I perform sacrifices, I do not merely cast offerings into the ditches and ravines. Above, it serves to commune with the blessings of the spirits; below, it unites the people and fosters goodwill among neighbors. If the spirits exist, then we are feeding our parents, brothers, and sisters—is this not a great benefit to the world?' Thus, Master Mozi said: 'If the kings, dukes, great officials, and gentlemen of the world truly wish to seek the welfare of all under Heaven and eliminate its harms, they must treat ghosts and spirits as real and honor them with clarity. This is the Way of the sage kings.'*\n\n**Against Music, Part 32**\nMaster Mozi said: *\"The task of the benevolent is necessarily to seek the welfare of all under Heaven and eliminate its harms. Let this be the standard for the world: if it benefits the people, do it; if it does not, stop. Moreover, the benevolent, in their deliberations for the world, do not act for the beauty of their eyes, the pleasure of their ears, the sweetness of their mouths, or the comfort of their bodies, thereby depleting the people’s resources for clothing and food. The benevolent do not do this. Thus, Master Mozi’s opposition to music is not because the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, flutes, and reed organs are not joyful, nor because carved and painted patterns are not beautiful, nor because the flavors of fattened and roasted meats are not sweet, nor because lofty towers and deep chambers are not comfortable. Though my body knows comfort, my mouth knows sweetness, my eyes know beauty, and my ears know joy, when I examine it above, it does not accord with the affairs of the sage kings, and when I measure it below, it does not benefit the people. Therefore, Master Mozi said: 'Music is wrong.' Now, though kings and great officials do not create musical instruments for the sake of the state, they do not merely gather clay and break earth to make them. They must heavily tax the people to produce the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, flutes, and reed organs. It is like the sage kings’ creation of boats and carts—I dare not oppose it. The ancient sage kings also heavily taxed the people to make boats and carts. Once completed, they asked: 'How shall we use them?' They said: 'Boats are for water, carts for land. The noble rest their feet, and the common people rest their shoulders and backs.' Thus, the people contributed their wealth to provide these, yet they did not resent it. Why? Because it returned to benefit the people. If musical instruments likewise benefit the people, then I dare not oppose them. But the people have three great afflictions: the hungry cannot eat, the cold cannot dress, and the weary cannot rest. Yet in such times, should we strike great bells, beat drums, pluck zithers, blow pipes and flutes, and brandish shields and axes, how can the people’s resources for clothing and food be obtained? I do not believe this is necessarily so.\"*\n\nLeaving this aside, consider now: when a great state attacks a small state, when a powerful clan oppresses a weaker one, when the strong plunder the weak, the many tyrannize the few, the cunning deceive the simple, the noble despise the humble—when bandits, rebels, thieves, and robbers arise together, unrestrained and unchecked. Yet in such times, should we strike great bells, beat drums, pluck zithers, blow pipes and flutes, and brandish shields and axes, how can the chaos of the world be governed and set right? I do not believe this is necessarily so.\n\nThus Master Mozi said: Suppose we heavily tax the people to produce the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, and flutes, seeking to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm—it would be of no avail. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nNow, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials stand upon lofty towers and spacious pavilions to observe, the bells are like suspended cauldrons—if they are not struck, what joy can be derived? Their reasoning must be that they must be struck. Yet if they are not struck, the old and slow cannot be employed. The old and slow have dull ears and dim eyes, weak limbs, discordant voices, and clumsy movements. They must employ those in their prime, whose ears and eyes are sharp, whose limbs are strong, whose voices are harmonious, and whose brows are nimble. If men are made to perform this, they abandon the times for plowing, planting, and cultivating; if women are made to perform this, they abandon their spinning, weaving, and sewing. Now, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials indulge in music, they waste the people’s time for clothing and food—this is excessive. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nOnce the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, and flutes are prepared, if the nobles grandly perform and listen alone, what joy can be derived? Their reasoning must be that they must share it with the lowly. Yet if they do not share it with the noble, the noble neglect their governance; if they share it with the lowly, the lowly neglect their tasks. Now, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials indulge in music, they waste the people’s resources for clothing and food—this is excessive. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nIn former times, Duke Kang of Qi established the *Music of Ten Thousand*, yet ten thousand men could not be clothed in coarse hemp nor fed with husks and dregs. He said: \"If food and drink are not fine, their faces and complexions are unworthy to behold; if clothing is not fine, their bodies and movements are unsightly and emaciated.\" Thus, they must eat millet and meat, wear embroidered silks—those who do not engage in producing clothing and food yet consume the people’s resources. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Now, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials waste the people’s resources for clothing and food to indulge in music—this is excessive. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nHumans are fundamentally different from birds, beasts, deer, crows, and insects. Birds, beasts, deer, crows, and insects use their feathers and fur for clothing, their hooves and claws for shoes, and water and grass for food and drink. Thus, the males need not plow, plant, or cultivate, nor the females spin, weave, or sew—their resources for clothing and food are already provided. Humans are not like this: those who rely on their strength govern, while those who do not rely on their strength do not govern. If the noble do not diligently govern, then laws and policies fall into chaos; if the lowly do not diligently work, then resources and supplies become insufficient.\n\nIf the gentlemen of the world do not accept my words, then let us briefly enumerate the world’s duties and observe the harm of music. Kings and nobles rise early and retire late to hear lawsuits and administer governance—this is their duty. Gentlemen exhaust their strength and employ their wisdom to manage internal offices and externally gather the profits of passes, markets, mountains, forests, and marshes to fill granaries and treasuries—this is their duty. Farmers rise early and return late to plow, plant, and cultivate, amassing grain—this is their duty. Women rise early and sleep late to spin, weave, and sew, producing much hemp, silk, kudzu, and fine cloth—this is their duty.\n\nNow, if kings and nobles delight in music and listen to it, they cannot rise early and retire late to hear lawsuits and administer governance—thus, the state falls into chaos and the altars of soil and grain are endangered. If gentlemen delight in music and listen to it, they cannot exhaust their strength and employ their wisdom to manage internal offices and externally gather profits to fill granaries and treasuries—thus, granaries and treasuries remain empty. If farmers delight in music and listen to it, they cannot rise early and return late to plow, plant, and cultivate—thus, grain is insufficient. If women delight in music and listen to it, they cannot rise early and sleep late to spin, weave, and sew—thus, cloth is not produced.\n\nIt is asked: What causes the noble to neglect governance and the state to abandon its tasks? It is music. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nHow do we know this is so? It is said: The *Punishments of the Officials* in the books of the former kings, those of Tang, record this.\n\nIt is said: When they dance the *Huan* in the palace halls, this is called the \"shaman’s wind.\" Its punishment: for the noble, two *wei* of silk are exacted; for the commoner, two *bo* of yellow cloth. It is then declared: Alas! The dancing sways and sways, the yellow words are most manifest—Heaven’s Mandate does not endure, and the Nine Lands perish thereby. Heaven is not pleased, and descends in false omens; that household must mourn a loss.\n\nExamining why the Nine Lands perished, it was solely from pursuing adorned music. At the *Wu Guan*, it is said: Qi indulged in excess and wanton joy, feasting in the wilds, clanging bells and striking chimes with force, drowning in wine and glutting on food in the fields. The *Wan* dance spread its wings, its glory resounding far and wide—Heaven did not take it as a model. Thus, above, the heavenly spirits did not approve; below, the myriad people did not benefit.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: Now, all the gentlemen and lords of the world who wish to seek the benefit of all under Heaven and remove its harms must recognize that music, as a thing, cannot but be prohibited and stopped.\n\n*Mozi, Scroll Eight, concludes*\n*Mozi, Scroll Nine: \"Against Music, Part Two\" (missing), \"Against Music, Part Three\" (missing), \"Against Mandate, Part One\" (missing)*\n\nMaster Mozi declared: In ancient times, the kings, dukes, and great men who governed states all desired their states to be prosperous, their people numerous, and their governance orderly. Yet instead of prosperity, they found poverty; instead of a multitude, they found few; instead of order, they found chaos. Thus, they lost what they sought and gained what they detested—why was this so?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: It is because those who cling to the doctrine of fate have mingled abundantly among the people. The words of those who cling to fate say: If fate decrees wealth, one is wealthy; if fate decrees poverty, one is poor. If fate decrees a multitude, there is a multitude; if fate decrees few, there are few. If fate decrees order, there is order; if fate decrees chaos, there is chaos. If fate decrees long life, one lives long; if fate decrees early death, one dies young. Though one may strive with all one’s might, what benefit is there?\n\nAbove, this doctrine pleases kings, dukes, and great men; below, it governs the people’s undertakings. Thus, those who cling to fate are unvirtuous. Therefore, the words of those who cling to fate must be clearly examined. How then shall we clearly examine this doctrine?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: One must establish a standard. To speak without a standard is like trying to determine morning and evening while standing atop a potter’s wheel. The distinctions between right and wrong, benefit and harm cannot be clearly known. Thus, speech must have three measures.\n\nWhat are the three measures? Master Mozi declared: There is the measure of foundation, the measure of origin, and the measure of application. What is the foundation? Above, it is founded upon the affairs of the ancient sage-kings. What is the origin? Below, it examines the actual experiences of the people’s ears and eyes. What is the application? It is applied in governance and penal law, observing whether it benefits the state, the people, and the populace. These are what are called the three measures of speech.\n\nYet today, the scholars and gentlemen of the world who claim fate exists have never truly examined the affairs of the sage-kings. In ancient times, the chaos wrought by Jie was received and rectified by Tang; the chaos wrought by Zhou was received and rectified by King Wu. The world had not changed, nor had the people altered. Under Jie and Zhou, the world was in chaos; under Tang and Wu, the world was ordered—how can this be called fate?\n\nYet today, the scholars and gentlemen of the world who claim fate exists have also not examined the books of the former kings. The books of the former kings, which issued state decrees and disseminated laws among the people, did they ever contain such sayings as: \"Fortune cannot be sought, misfortune cannot be avoided; reverence is of no benefit, violence incurs no harm\"? The laws by which judgments were heard and punishments meted out—did the former kings’ penal codes ever say: \"Fortune cannot be sought, misfortune cannot be avoided; reverence is of no benefit, violence incurs no harm\"? The oaths by which armies were arrayed and troops advanced or retreated—did the former kings’ oaths ever say: \"Fortune cannot be sought, misfortune cannot be avoided; reverence is of no benefit, violence incurs no harm\"?\n\nThus, Master Mozi declared: Though I have not exhaustively enumerated them, the fine books of the world cannot all be counted, but in broad terms, these five are sufficient. Now, if we do not seek the words of those who cling to fate, we need not necessarily accept them—is this not a proper rejection? To employ the words of those who cling to fate is to overturn the righteousness of the world. Those who overturn the world’s righteousness are the ones who establish fate, the critics of the common people. To propagate the criticism of the common people is to extinguish the people of the world.\n\nThen what is the purpose of desiring the virtuous to be in high positions? It is said: When the virtuous are in high positions, the world will surely be ordered. The spirits of Heaven, mountains, and rivers will surely have a lord to rely upon, and the myriad people will receive great benefit. How do we know this?\n\nMaster Mozi said: In ancient times, Tang was enfeoffed in Bo, where he adjusted the long and short to make a territory of a hundred *li*. With his people, he practiced universal love and mutual benefit, sharing in times of plenty. He led his people to revere Heaven above and serve the spirits. Thus, the spirits of Heaven enriched him, the feudal lords allied with him, the people cherished him, and worthy scholars flocked to him. Before his generation had passed, he reigned over the world and governed the feudal lords.\n\nFormerly, King Wen was enfeoffed in Qi Zhou, where he adjusted the long and short to make a territory of a hundred *li*. With his people, he practiced universal love and mutual benefit. Thus, those near were at peace with his governance, and those far were drawn to his virtue. Those who heard of King Wen all hastened to him. The incapable and unworthy, whose limbs were not benefited, remained and longed, saying: \"How might King Wen’s land reach me? Then would I not also be like King Wen’s people?\" Thus, the spirits of Heaven enriched him, the feudal lords allied with him, the people cherished him, and worthy scholars flocked to him. Before his generation had passed, he reigned over the world and governed the feudal lords.\n\nAs previously stated: When the virtuous are in high positions, the world will surely be ordered. The spirits of Heaven, mountains, and rivers will surely have a lord to rely upon, and the myriad people will receive great benefit. This is how we know it.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings issued decrees and commands, establishing rewards and punishments to encourage the worthy. Therefore, at home, they were filial and kind to their kin; abroad, they were respectful and dutiful in their villages. In sitting and dwelling, they had moderation; in going out and coming in, they had restraint. Men and women had distinction. Thus, when managing government offices, there was no theft; when guarding cities, there was no collapse or rebellion. When the lord faced peril, they died for him; when he went into exile, they followed him. These are what the rulers rewarded and the people praised.\n\nThe words of those who cling to fate say: What the rulers reward is simply what fate had already destined to be rewarded, not because of worthiness. What the rulers punish is simply what fate had already destined to be punished, not because of violence. Therefore, at home, they are not kind and filial to their kin; abroad, they are not respectful and dutiful in their villages. In sitting and dwelling, they lack moderation; in going out and coming in, they lack restraint. Men and women lack distinction. Thus, when managing government offices, there is theft; when guarding cities, there is collapse and rebellion. When the lord faces peril, they do not die for him; when he goes into exile, they do not follow him.\n\nThese are what the rulers punish and the people condemn.\n\nThose who cling to fate say: What the rulers punish is simply what fate had already destined to be punished, not because of violence. What the rulers reward is simply what fate had already destined to be rewarded, not because of worthiness. If one takes this as a principle for being a lord, one is unrighteous; for being a minister, one is disloyal; for being a father, one is unkind; for being a son, one is unfilial; for being an elder brother, one is unvirtuous; for being a younger brother, one is undutiful. Those who stubbornly adhere to this give rise to inauspicious words and follow the way of the violent.\n\nHow, then, do we know that fate is the way of the violent? In ancient times, the impoverished among the people were gluttonous in food and drink, lazy in their duties, and thus lacked sufficient clothing and resources, bringing upon themselves the worries of hunger, cold, and starvation. Yet they did not say, \"I am weary and unworthy; I do not work diligently.\" Instead, they said, \"My fate is destined to be poor and suffering.\" The violent kings of ancient times could not endure the excesses of their ears and eyes, the perversity of their hearts, and their disobedience to their kin, leading to the loss of their states and the overthrow of their altars of soil and grain. Yet they did not say, \"I am weary and unworthy; I govern poorly.\" Instead, they said, \"My fate is destined to lose them.\"\n\nIn *The Announcement of Zhong Hui*, it is said: \"I have heard from the Xia people that they falsified the Mandate of Heaven and spread it among the people. The Lord punished their evil, and their armies were utterly defeated.\" This speaks of Tang’s rejection of Jie’s clinging to fate. In *The Great Declaration*, it is said: \"Zhou of Yin dwelled in ease, refusing to serve the Lord on High and the ghosts and spirits, bringing disaster upon his ancestral spirits and cutting off their sacrifices.\" Yet he said, \"My people have their fate; there is no need for concern.\" Thus, Heaven abandoned him, casting him aside and refusing to protect him. This speaks of King Wu’s rejection of Zhou’s clinging to fate.\n\nIf we now adopt the words of those who cling to fate, then rulers will not heed governance, and the people will not attend to their duties. If rulers do not heed governance, then penal laws and administration will fall into chaos. If the people do not attend to their duties, then resources and supplies will be insufficient. Above, there will be nothing to provide for the grand sacrifices of wine and sweet liquor, to offer sacrifices to the Lord on High and the ghosts and spirits, to bestow grace upon the worthy and capable throughout the world. Abroad, there will be nothing to respond to the visits of the feudal lords’ envoys; at home, there will be nothing to feed the hungry, clothe the cold, and care for the elderly and weak. Thus, fate brings no benefit to Heaven above, no benefit to the ghosts and spirits in the middle, and no benefit to the people below. Those who stubbornly adhere to this give rise to inauspicious words and follow the way of the violent.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: Now, if the gentlemen and scholars of the world truly desire wealth for the world and detest its poverty, desire order and detest chaos, they cannot but reject the words of those who cling to fate. This is the great harm of the world.\n\n**Against Fate, Part Three (36)**\nMaster Mozi said: Whenever one speaks or engages in literary discourse as a Way, one must first establish standards of rightness. If one speaks without rightness, it is like placing the markers for dawn and dusk on a potter’s wheel—even with the most skillful craftsman, one cannot obtain correctness. Yet today, the true and false in the world cannot be discerned, so speech must have three methods.\n\nWhat are these three methods? There is the method of grounding, the method of tracing origins, and the method of application. In grounding, one examines the will of Heaven and the spirits and the affairs of the sage-kings. In tracing origins, one verifies with the books of the former kings. How does one apply them? By issuing them as penal laws. These are the three methods of speech.\n\nNow, some gentlemen and scholars of the world claim that fate does not exist. How do I know whether fate exists or not? By the evidence of the common people’s ears and eyes. What is heard and seen is said to exist; what is neither heard nor seen is said not to exist. Yet have they ever examined the sentiments of the people? From ancient times to the present, since the beginning of human life, has anyone ever seen the form of fate or heard the voice of fate? There has never been such a thing. If one considers the common people foolish and unworthy, their ears and eyes insufficient to serve as standards, then why not examine the transmitted words and flowing sayings of the feudal lords? From ancient times to the present, since the beginning of human life, has anyone ever heard the voice of fate or seen the form of fate? There has never been such a thing. Then why not examine the affairs of the sage-kings?\n\nThe sage-kings of old promoted filial sons and encouraged them to serve their parents, honored the worthy and good and encouraged them to do good, issued decrees and mandates to instruct, and employed rewards and punishments to encourage and deter. In this way, the chaotic could be ordered, and the endangered could be secured. If one does not believe this, consider: what Jie threw into chaos, Tang put in order; what Zhou threw into chaos, King Wu put in order. The world did not change, nor did the people alter, yet when the rulers changed their governance, the people’s teachings were transformed. Under Tang and Wu, there was order; under Jie and Zhou, there was chaos. Peace and danger, order and chaos, depend on the rulers’ issuance of governance—how can one speak of fate? Those who say there is fate are simply incorrect.\n\nNow, those who speak of fate say: \"I did not create this for later generations; from the Three Dynasties onward, such words have been transmitted and circulated.\" How should one respond to this? One should say: Do those who speak of fate not recall the sagely and good people of the Three Dynasties? Or do they recall the violent and unworthy people of the Three Dynasties? How do we know this?\n\nIn ancient times, the knights and grand officers were cautious in speech and wise in conduct. Above, they had means to admonish their rulers and lords; below, they had means to instruct and guide their people. Thus, above, they received the rewards of their rulers and lords; below, they received the praise of their people. The reputations of the knights and grand officers were not forgotten, and their words have been transmitted to the present day. The world says it was by their own efforts.\n\nThose who neglect the governance of their state and the welfare of their people, indulge in useless extravagance, and oppress the common folk, causing the lower ranks to grow estranged from their superiors—such rulers leave their nations desolate and ruined, their own bodies subject to punishment and execution. They cannot claim, \"I have seen fate at work.\"\n\nThus, the violent kings of the Three Dynasties did not restrain their indulgence in sensual pleasures, nor did they guard against the perversion of their hearts and wills. Outwardly, they galloped in hunting and archery; inwardly, they drowned in wine and revelry, exhausting themselves in worthlessness. When their governance and policies failed, they inevitably declared, \"It is my fate, and thus it must be.\" Even the impoverished commoners of the Three Dynasties followed this pattern: failing to serve their kin and superiors with goodness, despising reverence and frugality while favoring ease and simplicity, craving food and drink yet shirking labor—when their clothing and provisions fell short, leaving them to suffer cold, hunger, and want, they did not say, \"I am worthless and slow in my work,\" but instead insisted, \"My fate is inherently one of poverty.\" Even the deceitful people of the Three Dynasties acted no differently.\n\nThe doctrine of fate, embellished and propagated, has long misled the simple and unlearned. The sage-kings, recognizing this danger, inscribed their warnings on bamboo and silk, carved them into metal and stone. In the *Announcement of Zhong Hui* from the books of the former kings, it is said: \"I have heard that in the Xia, men falsely claimed the Mandate of Heaven, proclaiming it to the people below. The Lord detested this, and thus their armies were defeated.\" These words condemn Jie of Xia for his belief in fate, a doctrine that Tang and Zhong Hui jointly rejected.\n\nIn the *Great Declaration* of the former kings, it is further stated: \"Zhou of Yin dwelled in arrogance, refusing to serve the Supreme God, abandoning the sacrifices to his ancestral spirits. He declared, 'My people have their fate; let them not be burdened with toil.' Thus, Heaven cast him aside, no longer protecting him.\" These words condemn Zhou for his belief in fate, a doctrine that King Wu refuted with the *Great Declaration*.\n\nIn the *Three Dynasties’ Lost States*, it is written: \"You must not exalt the notion of fate bestowed by Heaven.\" The *Three Lost States* likewise deny the existence of fate. In the *Decree of the Duke of Shao*, it is commanded: \"Be reverent! There is no Mandate of Heaven—only we two must not spread falsehoods, nor claim that what we have not received descends from Heaven.\"\n\nIn the poetry and documents of the Shang and Xia, it is said: \"The doctrine of fate was created by violent kings.\" Now, if the gentlemen and scholars of the world wish to discern right from wrong and weigh benefit against harm, they must vigorously oppose the doctrine of fate. Those who cling to fate are the greatest harm to the world, and thus Master Mozi rejects it.\n\n**Against Fate, Part Three (Chapter 37)**\nMaster Mozi said: In all speech and discourse, one must first establish a standard before speaking. Without a prior standard, it is like trying to determine east and west while spinning a potter’s wheel—though one may debate morning and evening, no definitive conclusion can ever be reached. Thus, speech has three methods.\n\nWhat are the three methods? They are: verification, investigation, and application. How does one verify? By examining the deeds of the former sage-kings. How does one investigate? By observing the consensus of the people’s senses and experiences. How does one apply? By implementing policies in the state and observing their effects on the myriad people. These are the three methods.\n\nThus, when the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—governed the world, they declared: \"We must promote filial sons and encourage them to serve their parents, honor the worthy and good, and instruct them in virtue.\" Therefore, they issued policies and teachings, rewarding the good and punishing the violent. By doing so, they believed the world’s chaos could be brought to order, and the peril of the altars of soil and grain could be stabilized.\n\nIf one doubts this, consider: the disorder caused by Jie was rectified by Tang; the disorder caused by Zhou was rectified by King Wu. During these transitions, the world did not change, nor did the people alter, yet when the rulers transformed their governance, the people’s customs shifted. Under Jie and Zhou, the world was in chaos; under Tang and Wu, the world was at peace. The order of the world was the achievement of Tang and Wu; the chaos of the world was the fault of Jie and Zhou. From this, we see that safety and danger, order and disorder, depend on the governance of those above—how then can one speak of fate?\n\nThus, when Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu governed the world, they declared: \"We must ensure the hungry are fed, the cold are clothed, the weary find rest, and the disordered are brought to order.\" As a result, they gained illustrious reputations throughout the world. How could this be attributed to fate? It was clearly the result of their efforts.\n\nNow, the worthy and good, who honor virtue and value the Dao and its arts, receive the rewards of kings, dukes, and great men above, and the praise of the myriad people below. They too gain illustrious reputations throughout the world. How could this be attributed to fate? It is also the result of their efforts.\n\nYet those who today assert the existence of fate—do they not recall the sagely and good people of the Three Dynasties? Or do they recall the violent and unworthy? If we examine their claims, they must not be referring to the sagely and good of the Three Dynasties, but rather the violent and unworthy. Indeed, those who today insist on the existence of fate point to the violent kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—who, though noble as Sons of Heaven and wealthy as rulers of all under Heaven, did not restrain their sensual desires or guard against the perversion of their hearts. Outwardly, they galloped in hunting and archery; inwardly, they drowned in wine and revelry, neglecting the governance of their states and the welfare of their people. Indulging in useless extravagance and oppressing the common folk, they ultimately lost their ancestral temples. Yet they did not say, \"I am worthless and weak in governance,\" but instead insisted, \"My fate was inherently one of loss.\"\n\nEven the weak and unworthy common folk of the Three Dynasties were no different. Unable to serve their kin, rulers, and elders with goodness, they deeply despised reverence and frugality, favoring simplicity and ease. Greedy for food and drink, they were lazy in their duties, so their clothing and provisions fell short, and they thus suffered the worries of hunger, cold, and want. Yet they did not say, \"I am weak and unworthy, my efforts are insufficient,\" but instead insisted, \"My fate was inherently one of poverty.\"\n\nThe false people of the Three Dynasties were just the same. When the violent kings arose, they impoverished and ruined them—all because they doubted the multitude, despised simplicity, and troubled the former sagely kings. This was already a concern long before. Thus, it was inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, engraved on basins and bowls, and passed down to later generations of descendants. What writings remain? The *Total Virtue of Yu* records: \"Truly, it is not that Heaven is unmanifest, but that the people do not preserve it. Once the heart turns to evil, Heaven inflicts blame. If one does not carefully guard their virtue, how can Heaven’s mandate be preserved?\"\n\nThe *Announcement of Zhong Hui* states: \"I have heard that the people of Xia falsely claimed the Mandate of Heaven below, and the Lord thus increased their punishment, bringing ruin to their hosts.\" To call what is not into being is called \"falsification.\" If something exists and is called so, how could that be called falsification? In the past, Jie clung to the notion of fate and acted accordingly, so Tang composed the *Announcement of Zhong Hui* to refute him.\n\nThe words of the *Great Declaration* say, in the *Departure of Fa*: \"Alas, noble men! Heaven has manifest virtue, and its conduct is most evident. The mirror is not far off—it lies in the former Yin kings. They claimed that men have fate, that reverence cannot be practiced, that sacrifices are of no benefit, and that violence brings no harm. Heaven is not constant; the Nine Provinces perished because of this. Heaven is not compliant; prayers brought down their ruin. Only we, the Zhou, received the great mandate from the Supreme Lord.\" In the past, Zhou clung to the notion of fate and acted accordingly, so King Wu composed the *Great Declaration* and the *Departure of Fa* to refute him.\n\nHe said: \"Why do you not examine the records of Shang, Zhou, Yu, and Xia, or consult the chapters of the *Ten Bamboo Slips*? None of them contain such claims—what then should be done?\" Therefore, Master Mozi said: \"When the gentlemen of the world today engage in literature or speak, it is not merely to exercise their tongues or benefit their lips and jaws. In truth, they seek to govern their states, cities, and the myriad people with proper punishments and policies.\"\n\nNow, why do the kings, dukes, and great officials rise early and retire late, hearing lawsuits and managing governance, laboring all day to distribute duties without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, there will be order; if not, there will be chaos. If we are strong, there will be peace; if not, there will be danger. Thus, we dare not rest or grow weary.\"\n\nWhy do the ministers and great officers exhaust the strength of their limbs and strain their minds, managing offices within and gathering the profits of passes, markets, mountains, forests, marshes, and weirs without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, we will be honored; if not, we will be disgraced. If we are strong, we will be glorious; if not, we will be shamed. Thus, we dare not rest or grow weary.\"\n\nWhy do farmers rise early and return late, striving in plowing, planting, and cultivation, amassing much grain without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, we will be rich; if not, we will be poor. If we are strong, we will be full; if not, we will be hungry. Thus, we dare not rest or grow weary.\"\n\nWhy do women rise early and sleep late, striving in spinning, weaving, and fine work, producing much hemp, ramie, and cloth without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, we will be rich; if not, we will be poor. If we are strong, we will be warm; if not, we will be cold. Thus, we dare not grow weary.\"\n\nNow, if even those who are not kings, dukes, or great officials truly believed in fate and acted accordingly, they would surely cease hearing lawsuits and managing governance. Ministers and great officers would cease managing offices. Farmers would cease plowing, planting, and cultivation. Women would cease spinning, weaving, and sewing. If kings, dukes, and great officials ceased hearing lawsuits and managing governance, and ministers and great officers ceased managing offices, then I say the world would surely fall into chaos. If farmers ceased plowing, planting, and cultivation, and women ceased spinning, weaving, and sewing, then I say the world’s clothing and provisions would surely be insufficient.\n\nIf one were to govern the world in this way, serving the spirits of Heaven above, the spirits would not respond; providing for the hundred clans below, the people would gain no benefit and would inevitably scatter, becoming unusable. Thus, defenses would not hold, and punishments would not prevail. This is why even the violent kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—lost their states and overthrew their altars of soil and grain.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: \"Now, the scholars and gentlemen of the world who truly seek to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm must reject the words of those who claim fate exists. Fate is what violent kings fabricated and impoverished men relied upon—it is not the speech of the benevolent. Now, those who practice benevolence and righteousness must carefully examine and strongly refute this.\"\n\n*Against the Confucians, Part One (Chapter 38, missing)*\n*Against the Confucians, Part Two (Chapter 39)*\n\nThe Confucians say: \"Loving one’s kin has its methods, and honoring the worthy has its degrees.\" They speak of the differences between close and distant, noble and base. Their rites say: \"For the mourning of parents, three years; for the eldest son, three years; for uncles, brothers, and sons by concubines, one year; for distant relatives, five months.\" If the duration of mourning is based on closeness, then the closer one is, the longer the mourning, and the more distant, the shorter. Thus, a wife and eldest son would mourn as long as a father. If it is based on nobility, then this would mean honoring one’s wife and son as much as one’s parents, while treating uncles and elder brothers of the clan as inferior to one’s son.\n\nHow could there be a greater perversion? When their kin die, they line the doors with white, climb onto the roof to peer into wells, poke into rat holes, and rummage through washbasins in search of the departed. If they truly believe the dead are there, their delusion is extreme. If they know the dead are gone yet still search, their deceit is profound. When taking a wife, they personally go to receive her, bowing and trembling like servants, holding the reins and offering the carriage strap as if facing a stern parent. The rites and solemnity of the wedding ceremony rival those of ancestral sacrifices. They invert the proper order, defying and dishonoring parents, elevating wives and children while wives and children encroach upon their superiors. Can such conduct toward parents be called filial?\n\nThe tradition holds that when welcoming a wife, she serves at one ancestral sacrifice, and the son will guard the ancestral temple—hence its gravity. To this, we respond: This is a falsehood. A man’s elder brother guards the ancestral temple for decades, and when he dies, his mourning period is brief, while his younger brother’s wife continues the ancestral sacrifices without interruption. Thus, mourning a wife or son for three years cannot be for the sake of guarding or serving the sacrifices. They claim that grieving for wives and children with great lamentation is to honor kinship. But to exalt what should be secondary and belittle what should be primary—is this not the height of treachery?\n\nSome stubbornly cling to the doctrine of fate, arguing: \"Longevity and early death, wealth and poverty, safety and danger, order and chaos—all are fixed by heaven’s decree and cannot be altered. Rewards and punishments, fortune and misfortune have their limits; human knowledge and effort cannot change them.\" If officials believe this, they will neglect their duties. If commoners believe it, they will abandon their work. Neglect leads to disorder, and slackened farming leads to poverty—poverty and disorder are the roots of misgovernment. Yet the Confucians teach this as the Way, thereby demeaning the people of the world.\n\nMoreover, they adorn rites and music to lead people astray, prolong mourning with feigned sorrow to deceive their kin, preach fate to excuse poverty while living in idleness, abandon fundamentals and duties to seek ease. Greedy for food and drink, lazy in their labors, they fall into hunger and cold, perilously close to starvation, with no means to escape. They exhaust human *qi*, hoarding like rats and gazing like sheep, leaping like hares. The nobleman laughs at them, and they grow angry, retorting: \"You fool! What do you know of true Confucians!\"\n\nIn summer, they beg for wheat and grain. Once the five grains are harvested, they follow grand funerals, bringing along their entire families to feast until sated, attending to multiple burials until satisfied. They rely on others’ households for sustenance, depend on others’ fields for their livelihood, and when the wealthy have a funeral, they rejoice greatly, saying: \"This is our source of food and clothing.\"\n\nThe Confucians say: \"The noble man must wear the speech of antiquity to be humane.\" We reply: What they call \"ancient\" was all once new, and the ancients wore it—thus they were noble men. Then must one imitate what is *not* the attire of noble men, speak what is *not* the speech of noble men, to be humane?\n\nThey also say: \"The noble man follows but does not innovate.\" We reply: In ancient times, Yi invented the bow, Zi made armor, Xizhong built the chariot, and Qiaochui crafted the boat. Then are today’s tanners, armorers, wheelwrights, and shipbuilders all noble men, while Yi, Zi, Xizhong, and Qiaochui were petty men? Furthermore, what they follow must have been created by someone—then all they follow are the ways of petty men.\n\nThey say: \"The noble man, when victorious, does not pursue the fleeing, casts aside the quiver without shooting, and if the enemy is strong, assists them in righting their chariot.\" We reply: If all were humane, there would be no need for such rules—they would naturally guide one another by the principles of right and wrong in their choices. The ignorant would follow the wise, the uninformed would yield to the informed, the wordless would submit to reason, and upon seeing goodness, they would reform. Why would they need such constraints? But if violent men clash in brutal conflict, and the victor refrains from pursuing the fleeing, discards the quiver without shooting, and helps the enemy right their chariot, even if he did all this, he could not be called a noble man.\n\nImagine a brutal and cruel state where a sage arises to rid the world of harm, raising an army to punish the wicked. The victorious general issues orders to his soldiers: \"Do not pursue the fleeing, cast aside the quiver without shooting, and if they falter, help them right their chariot.\" The violent and lawless would survive, the world’s harm would remain unchecked, and this would be to spare the murderers of parents and deeply degrade the age—no greater injustice exists.\n\nThey also say: \"You are like a bell: strike it, and it rings; do not strike it, and it remains silent.\" We reply: The humane man serves his lord with utmost loyalty, serves his parents with filial devotion, strives for goodness and excels, and admonishes when there is fault—this is the way of a minister. But to ring only when struck, to remain silent unless questioned, to conceal knowledge and strength, to wait passively for inquiry before responding—even if his lord or parents faced great benefit or harm, he would not speak unless asked. If a great rebellion were brewing, bandits about to rise, or a trap about to spring, and he alone knew while others did not, even with his lord and parents present, he would not speak unless questioned—such a man is a traitor to great disorder.\n\nTo serve as a minister thus is disloyal, as a son is unfilial, as a younger brother is undutiful, and in dealings with others is untrustworthy. In a court that values silence, people act only for profit. Though he fears speaking last, if his lord’s words bring no benefit, he folds his hands, gazes downward, and feigns deep contemplation, saying: \"It is only that he has not studied this.\" Whom does he serve in haste? His conduct strays far indeed.\n\nThe single Way of learning and practice is humanity and rightness. In great matters, it governs people; in small matters, it qualifies one for office. Applied broadly, it benefits all; applied narrowly, it guides the self. It does not dwell in unrighteousness, nor act against reason. It strives to advance the world’s benefit, adapting to circumstances, ceasing when benefit is achieved—this is the noble man’s Way. But what we have heard of Confucius’ conduct is fundamentally opposed to this.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi asked Yanzi: \"What sort of man is Confucius?\"\n\nYanzi did not respond. The Duke asked again, yet he still did not respond. Duke Jing said: \"Many have spoken to me of Kong Qiu, all calling him a worthy man. Now that I ask you, why do you not answer?\"\n\nYanzi replied: \"Ying is unworthy and cannot recognize a worthy man. Nevertheless, I have heard that one called a worthy man, upon entering a state, must strive to harmonize the intimacy between ruler and ministers and quell the resentment between high and low. Kong Qiu, however, was so harsh that when he learned of Duke Bai’s plot, he presented him with Shi Qi. The ruler’s person nearly perished, and Duke Bai was executed. I have heard that a worthy man, when favored by superiors, does not act in vain, and when trusted by subordinates, does not endanger them. His words, heard by the ruler, must benefit the people; his teachings, followed by those below, must accord with those above. Thus his words are clear and easily understood, his conduct easy to follow. His actions in righteousness can be made manifest to the people, and his plans and considerations can be communicated to ruler and ministers. Now Kong Qiu, with deep deliberation, conspired to serve a traitor; with exhaustive thought and all his knowledge, he acted perversely. He incited those below to disorder those above, teaching ministers to kill their ruler—this is not the conduct of a worthy man. Entering another’s state, he allied with that state’s traitors—this is not the kind that acts with rightness. Knowing a man to be disloyal, he hastened to aid him in rebellion—this is not the way of humanity and rightness. Fleeing others before plotting, avoiding others before speaking, his actions in righteousness cannot be made manifest to the people, his plans and considerations cannot be communicated to ruler and ministers. Your servant Ying sees no difference between Kong Qiu and Duke Bai, and so I did not respond.\"\n\nDuke Jing said: \"Alas! Many have deceived me. Were it not for you, Master, I would have gone my whole life without knowing that Kong Qiu was the same as Duke Bai.\"\n\nWhen Kong Qiu came to Qi, he had an audience with Duke Jing. The Duke was pleased and wished to enfeoff him at Nixi, so he informed Yanzi. Yanzi said: \"This cannot be. The Ru are idle and self-indulgent; they cannot be used to instruct those below. They delight in music and lead others astray; they cannot be made to govern closely. They establish fate and neglect affairs; they cannot be made to hold office. They venerate mourning and prolong grief; they cannot be made to show compassion to the people. They wear elaborate robes and force their demeanor; they cannot be made to guide the masses. Kong Qiu, with his grand appearance and meticulous adornments, bewitches the world. With strings and songs, drums and dances, he gathers disciples. With the elaborate rites of ascent and descent, he displays propriety. With the ostentatious steps of haste and circling, he impresses the crowd. Ru learning cannot be used to deliberate on the world; their exhausting thoughts cannot be put to use. Even a long life cannot exhaust their studies; in their prime, they cannot perform their rites. Accumulated wealth cannot satisfy their pleasures. With ornate and perverse arts, they scheme to ingratiate themselves with the ruler of the age. With grand music and entertainment, they corrupt the people. Their Way cannot be expected to last through the ages; their learning cannot be used to guide the masses. Now, my lord, if you enfeoff him, it will benefit Qi’s customs, but it will not serve to guide the state and lead the people.\"\n\nThus, the lord deferred the enfeoffment, receiving him with reverence yet never inquiring into his Way. Confucius, enraged at Duke Jing and Yanzi, then cultivated ties with Jiayi Zi and the gate of Tian Chang, informing Nanguo Huizi of his ambitions before returning to Lu. Soon after, hearing that Qi was about to invade Lu, he said to Zigong: \"Ci! The time to launch great affairs is now.\" He dispatched Zigong to Qi, where he met with Tian Chang through Nanguo Huizi, urging him to attack Wu and instructing Gao, Guo, Bao, and Yan to refrain from interfering with Tian Chang’s rebellion, while also encouraging Yue to attack Wu. Within three years, Qi and Wu were shattered by the calamity of war, their corpses piled high as the plains of Wei—this was the retribution for Confucius.\n\nWhen Confucius served as Minister of Justice in Lu, he abandoned the public good to side with the Ji family. The Ji clan coerced the ruler of Lu into exile, and when the Ji lord and the townspeople clashed at the city gate, the gate’s crossbar was torn down. Confucius was stranded between Cai and Chen, reduced to eating wild greens without grain, and after ten days, Zilu prepared a suckling pig for him. Confucius ate without asking where the meat had come from. Someone offered him a robe and fine wine, and he drank without inquiring into their origins.\n\nWhen the Lord of Chen welcomed Confucius, he would not sit unless the mat was properly aligned, nor eat unless the meat was cut correctly. Zilu approached and asked: \"Why does your conduct here differ so from that in Cai and Chen?\" Confucius replied: \"Come, let me tell you. Before, when we were desperate, we did not refuse ill-gotten means to survive. When sated, we feigned virtue to adorn ourselves—what greater deceit and depravity could there be?\"\n\nConfucius once sat with his disciples and remarked: \"When Shun approached his blind father, Gu Sou, was the world not in peril? Was the Duke of Zhou not a true man? Why then did he abandon his home and take refuge elsewhere?\" Confucius’s actions were the product of his heart’s machinations. His followers and disciples all emulated him: Zigong and Zilu aided Kong Li in Wei, Yang Hu sowed chaos in Qi, Fo Ban rebelled in Zhongmou, and they sought to carve up the land and maim the people—no greater harm could be done.\n\nFor disciples to succeed their masters, they must refine their words, model their conduct, and strive until their strength or wisdom is exhausted. Yet Confucius’s conduct was as described—how then can the Ru scholars not be doubted?\n\nHis later wife, upon seeing the corpse at the door, did not gather the remains. The Ru scholars transmitted this, saying: \"The Way of the former kings was to conceal their private affairs, and their words and attire were to be followed.\" If people speak of this, then it is not the teaching of the former kings. The Ru scholars’ attire was like this—how could it be imitated? Moreover, the two Ru scholars of Lu, in their conduct, made things clear and easy to follow.\n\nFormerly, when Duke Jing of Qi questioned Yanzi, saying: \"Formerly, I lived for mere survival; now, I live for mere righteousness.\" Yanzi replied: \"Who would follow such a path? If one lives for mere survival, then righteousness is discarded; if one lives for mere righteousness, then survival is cast aside. How can this be the Way?\" The Duke said: \"Excellent!\" The Ru scholars’ teachings are like refuse—how can they be of use?\n\nThus, achievement comes only after attainment.\nCessation arises from duration.\nForm is the division within the whole.\nNecessity is unceasing persistence.\nKnowledge is capacity.\nLevelness is equal height.\nDeliberation is seeking.\nSameness is the mutual exhaustion of length with vessels.\nKnowledge is contact.\nThe center is equal length.\nUnderstanding is clarity.\nThickness is having great extent.\nBenevolence is embodied love.\nMidday is the south of the vessel.\nRighteousness is benefit.\nStraightness is alignment.\nRitual is reverence.\nA circle is a single center with equal length.\nAction is doing.\nA square is four corners with meticulous angles.\nSubstance is flourishing.\nDoubling is becoming two.\nLoyalty is striving for benefit through earnest effort.\nThe beginning is the foremost part of the body without sequence.\nFilial piety is benefiting one’s parents.\nHaving a question is the center.\nTrustworthiness is words aligning with intent.\nA question does not extend to the periphery.\nTogether is self-initiated.\nInquiry is questioning emptiness.\nNaming is creating designation.\nFullness is having without exception.\nIntegrity is acting against wrong.\nFirmness and whiteness do not exclude each other.\nCommand is not what is self-initiated.\nHarmony is mutual attainment.\nResponsibility is a scholar diminishing oneself to enhance what one does.\nResemblance is having both mutual and non-mutual harmony.\nCourage is the daring of the will.\nOrder is unquestioned and unceasing harmony.\nStrength is the vigor of punishment.\nLaw is what is followed to be so.\nLife is the dwelling of punishment and knowledge.\nTogether is what is so.\nExternality is knowing without knowledge.\nExplanation is what clarifies.\nDreaming is taking the external to be so.\nImpossibility is mutual exclusion.\nEquanimity is knowing without desire or aversion.\nDisputation is contending over possibility.\nVictory in disputation is correctness.\nBenefit is what is attained with joy.\nDoing is exhausting knowledge and aligning with desire.\nHarm is what is attained with aversion.\nCompletion is fulfillment or absence.\nGovernance is seeking attainment.\nCommand is designation and cause.\nPraise is clarifying excellence.\nNames are universal, categorical, and private.\nSlander is clarifying wrongdoing.\n\"Saying\" is transfer, elevation, or imposition.\nElevation is modeling reality.\nKnowledge is inquiry, explanation, and intimacy.\nNames and reality unite to form.\nSpeech is the expression of elevation.\nHearing is broad and intimate.\nMoreover, speech affirms.\nSeeing is embodiment and exhaustion.\nRuler, minister, and commoner are interconnected through agreement.\nUnity is vessel, appropriateness, and necessity.\nMerit is benefiting the people.\nDesiring vessel and weighing benefit, while also detesting vessel and weighing harm.\nReward is the superior repaying the merit of the subordinate.\nDoing is preservation, absence, change, dissolution, governance, and transformation.\nCrime is violating prohibitions.\nSameness is doubling, embodiment, unity, and category.\nPunishment is the superior repaying the crime of the subordinate.\nDifference is duality, embodiment, non-unity, and non-category.\nSameness and difference both reside in the one.\nSameness and difference intersect to yield existence and non-existence.\nDuration is encompassing different times.\nGuardianship is encompassing different places.\nHearing is the acuity of the ear.\nExhaustion is when something has no room ahead for even a foot.\nFollowing what is heard to grasp its meaning is the discernment of the heart.\nExhaustion is nothing not being so.\nSpeech is the fluency of the mouth.\nBeginning is the present moment.\nHolding to speech to reveal intent is the disputation of the heart.\nTransformation is evident change.\nAssent is not uniformly beneficial.\nDiminishment is partial removal.\nMastering explanations and tones is beneficial.\nSkillful turning seeks its cause.\nGreatly increasing sameness, the storehouse, is change.\nSome follow.\nCessation distinguishes the Way by cause.\nRead this text horizontally.\nVessels are without exception.\n*Canon Below, Forty-First*\n\nCircling the root.\nWhen laws are the same, observe the law;

it is not that it must not be otherwise—it must be so.\nThe sage employs without insisting; what must be so can be without doubt.\nBalance is two without partiality.\nAction: building a platform early is preservation.\nIllness is perishing.\nBuying sacrificial wine is exchange.\nExhausting the night is sweeping away.\nFollowing growth is governance.\nExhausting purchase is transformation.\nTwo names for one actuality is redundant sameness.\nNot external to inclusion is bodily sameness.\nDwelling together in a room is united sameness.\nHaving a basis for sameness is categorical sameness.\nDifference is two necessarily differing—two.\nNot connected is not bodily.\n.\n\nDiffering in location is non-convergence.\nHaving no commonality is non-categorization.\nWhere sameness and difference intersect, fortune’s household thrives.\nCompassion encompasses presence and absence.\n\nComparison.\nMeasurement is quantity—more or less.\nUnraveling thread to return to the garden is departure and arrival.\nThe crow’s break uses paulownia: hardness and softness.\nThe sword’s edge is early death: life and death.\nDwelling in a room with a child: the child is neither elder nor younger.\nTwo severed victories: black and white.\nThe center is the periphery.\nDebating conduct, conduct, conduct, and learning’s substance: right and wrong.\nDifficult lodging: completion and incompletion.\nBrothers: both depart together.\nThe body remains while the will travels: existence and perishing.\nHuo as a surname: origin.\nMarket propriety: nobility and baseness.\nAssent: leaping over the city wall to shoulder the burden and halt.\nFollowing one another, departing one another, foreknowledge, rightness, possibility—these are the five colors.\nLength and shortness, front and back, lightness and weight—grasping them.\n\nHolding to compliance is difficult to achieve; speech strives for its completion—nine principles seek to grasp it.\nMethod: modeling takes sameness to observe skillful transmission; modeling selects this and rejects that, inquiring into causes to observe propriety.\nIf among people there are those with blackness and those without, halt the black people.\nIf there are those who love people and those who do not, loving people in the heart—which is fitting for the heart?\nWhen they raise what is so, taking this to be so, then raise what is not so and question it.\nThough the sage may have wrongs, he does not condemn them; rectifying the five assents, all enter into knowledge with explanation.\nExceeding the five assents is like bearing debt—without justification, without explanation.\nEmploying the five assents is like naturalness.\n\nExpository Sayings, Lower Forty-Third\nHalt: they take this to be so and explain it as so; I take this to be not so and doubt it as so.\nCalling four-footed beasts, living crows, and all things—these are matters of size.\nIf this is so and that must be so, then they are together.\nFor the elk, same name; together they intrude, not together they are two, three, or closure.\nWrap, liver, lungs, child—these are loves.\nTangerine and cogongrass: eating and gathering.\nWhite horses are many in whiteness; seeing horses is not many in seeing—whiteness and seeing differ.\nBeauty is not necessarily beautiful; not necessarily beautiful is akin to violence.\nTo do wrong by a person is not to do wrong—like being a husband without being a husband, making shoes to buy clothes is about the husband and the shoes.\nTwo and one perish; not perishing with one is partial departure.\nNot yet.\n\nThere is form and substance, and then it is named;\nWithout form and substance, there is no naming.\nNot like spreading and beauty—calling it so makes it inherently beautiful; calling it not so makes it not beautiful; without naming, there is retribution.\nSeeing and not seeing separate; one and two do not fill each other—breadth follows hardness and whiteness.\nLifting without heaviness does not match the needle—it is not the task of strength.\nFor the crumbling of the grasp, doubling is not the task of wisdom.\nLike the ears and eyes differing.\nWood and night—which is longer? Wisdom and grain—which is more? Rank, kinship, conduct, market—among these four, which is nobler?\nElk and Huo—which is taller? Elk and Huo—which is Huo?\nThread and zither—which is zither?\nPartiality: both are one without change.\nBorrowing: borrowing must be not so and then borrowing occurs.\nThe dog borrows Huo, just as the clan is Huo.\nThings may harm it—this is so.\nSeeing it is wisdom.\nAuspiciousness commands it, employing wisdom.\n\nThe Doubtful Reed—when made into a task, it becomes a scholar’s tool; when made into a cow-shed, it brings summer cold—such is the reed.\nLift it, and it is light; discard it, and it is heavy—this is not the work of strength.\nSmoothness follows carving—this is not the work of skill.\nLike stone and feather, it follows its nature.\nThe ruin of the drinker comes from wine, as from the midday sun—this cannot be wisdom.\nIs it folly?\nOr is it wisdom to take one’s own view as right?\nIt is folly.\nTogether, they are one—like the four hooves of ox and horse.\nOnly thus: ox and horse are as they are.\nCount the oxen, count the horses—ox and horse are two.\nCount oxen-and-horses—ox and horse are one.\nLike counting fingers: five fingers, yet five is one.\nThe Long Vault—moving yet having place, the vault.\nThe vault: south and north exist in the \"now\" and \"not,\" the vault moves yet endures.\nWithout hardness, whiteness is obtained—necessarily they fill each other.\nIn the present, Yao’s good governance exists among the ancients.\nIf the ancients exist in the present, then Yao could not govern.\nShadow: when light arrives, shadow vanishes.\nIf it exists, it ceases even in the farthest past.\nShadow: two lights flank one light—the single light is the shadow.\nThe man who reflects light shines like an archer’s shot.\nThe man below appears high; the man above appears low.\nFeet block the lower light, thus forming shadow at rest.\nThe head blocks the upper light, thus forming shadow below.\nDistance and proximity have their limits with light—thus the shadow is contained within.\nShadow: the sun’s light reflects back onto a man, so the shadow lies between sun and man.\nShadow: a wooden coffin’s shadow is short and large.\nWhen the wood is upright, the shadow is long and small.\nIn size relative to the wood, the shadow is larger than the wood—not merely smaller.\nFrom afar or near, facing or upright, the mirror’s reflection is few, its appearance—whether fair or dark—differs with distance, coffin, uprightness, and light.\nShadows should converge together; departures should coincide.\nBoth use the north.\nThe mirror’s scent—nothing is unreflected in the mirror.\nThe scent of shadows is numberless, yet must pass through the upright.\nThus, in the same place, their forms are together, yet the mirror divides.\nWithin the mirror’s center.\nThe nearer the mirror is to the center, the larger the reflection and the shadow.\nFarther from the center, the smaller the reflection and the shadow.\nYet it must be upright.\nRising from the center’s green upright, extending its straightness.\nOutside the center, the nearer the mirror is to the center, the larger the reflection and the shadow.\nFarther from the center, the smaller the reflection and the shadow.\nYet it must change, aligning with the upright and extending its straightness.\nThe mirror: the nearer the viewer, the larger the reflection and the shadow.\nFarther away, the smaller the reflection and the shadow.\nYet it must be upright.\nThe shadow passes the upright.\nThus, lifting a balance beam with a crossbar—why does it not bend like a heavy weight?\nThe pole overcomes the weight.\nWhen the right crossbar is tied with a rope, no addition causes bending—the pole does not overcome the weight.\nIf weight is added to one side of the balance, it must tilt.\nWhen weight and counterweight are equal, they balance—then the root is short and the tip long.\nIf both sides are weighted equally, the tip must descend, for the tip gains the counterweight.\nLifting requires strength; pulling requires none—what is lifted does not stop at the point of application.\nThe rope controls the lift, like piercing with an awl.\nIn lifting, the long and heavy descend; the short and light ascend.\nThe higher ascends, the more it gains; the lower descends, the more it loses.\nWhen the rope is straight and weight and counterweight are equal, it is centered.\nIn pulling, the higher loses more; the lower gains more.\nWhen the weight above is exhausted, the lift is complete.\nTwo wheels high, two wheels as wheels—a cart’s ramp.\nWeight its front, string its front.\nLoad the string at the front, load the string at the axle, and suspend weight at the front.\nThis is the ramp: lift and lift again, then it moves.\nAll weight: if not lifted above, not pulled below, not forced from the side, then it descends straight.\nEarth—something harms it.\nThe one who breaks the ramp cannot obtain it—it is straight.\n\nHere the abandoned measuring-rod lies on level ground—weight does not descend, for there is no counterweight.\nWhen the rope draws the axle, it is as if pulling crosswise from within a boat.\nLean, double, resist, harden—if one lies propped, it is not upright.\nWho pairs white stone with plain stone? That is the method.\nPlace a square stone one foot above the ground, set a fulcrum beneath it, and suspend a silk thread from above, letting it just reach the square stone—if it does not descend, it is a pillar.\nWhen the thread is glued to the stone, it is lifting.\nWhen the thread snaps, it is pulling.\nBefore the thing changes, its name shifts—this is gathering.\nIn trade, knife and grain set each other’s price.\nWhen knives are light, grain is not dear; when knives are heavy, grain is not cheap.\nThe royal knife does not change, but grain changes—when grain changes yearly, so does the knife’s value.\nIt is like a fasting boy.\nWhen the price is exhausted, all that remains is what was not suspect.\nWhat does not depart in good order is called \"Buddha.\"\nA jar’s price may be fitting or not, just as a jar may be desired or not.\nLike a ruined state’s fasting chamber, marrying off a child who has no child.\nIn war, one does not necessarily die or live; hearing of battle, one does not necessarily survive.\nBefore, there was no fear—now, there is fear.\nSome know that this is not that, or that this is not in that, yet still call this south or north, passing by and taking themselves as right.\nAt first, they called this south—thus now they call this south.\nTo discuss knowledge: without knowledge, there is no means.\nTo say \"this is called\" is not the same as \"that is called\"—then they are different.\nIf the same, one might call it a dog, or one might call it a hound.\nIf different, one might call it an ox, or an ox might be called a horse.\nWith neither prevailing, there is no dispute.\nDisputation is when some call it right and some call it wrong—the correct one prevails.\nWine without deference is not yet deference; at the beginning, it cannot be deferred.\nIn stone, there is one, yet hardness and whiteness are two—and both are in the stone.\nThus there is knowledge of one, and lack of knowledge of the other—this is permissible.\nIf you know this, but do not know what I first raised, it is weighty.\nThen you know this, but do not know what I first raised.\nThis is one.\nTo say there is knowledge of one and lack of knowledge of the other...\nIf you know it, then when you point to what you know and tell me, I will know it.\nTo point to both is to make two.\nTo weigh the pointing is to make three straight.\nIf you insist on pointing only to what I raise and not to what I do not raise, then you cannot point alone.\nWhat one wishes to convey does not transmit—intent remains unchecked.\nMoreover, what you know is this, and what you do not know is this—then this is knowing and not knowing the same thing. How can it be one, to say there is knowledge of one and lack of knowledge of the other?\nAs for spring, its grasp is inherently unpointable.\nA fleeing minister does not know his whereabouts; dogs and hounds do not know their names.\nA leaver is one who cannot manage both.\nTo know a dog is weighty; to know a hound is also weighty—then it is excessive.\nWithout weight, it is not excessive.\nIn communication, when asked, \"Do you know hunger?\" one replies, \"What do you mean?\"\nIf they say \"almsgiving,\" then one knows.\nIf one does not ask what \"hunger\" means but directly answers without knowing, it is excessive.\nMoreover, a response must respond—when asked, the response should be timely, and long responses have depth and shallowness.\nHeaven’s constancy is centered; soldiers are long in their place.\nA hall is where it exists; its child is what exists.\nIf one relies on what exists to ask about the hall, how can it exist?\nIf one takes the hall as primary and asks what exists, what exists?\nThis is one: taking what exists as primary to ask about where it exists, and taking where it exists as primary to ask about what exists.\nFive elements combine: water, earth, fire—fire separates thus.\nFire melts metal—fire is abundant.\nMetal consumes charcoal—metal is abundant.\nTheir union is the storehouse of wood; wood separates from wood.\nIf one knows the number of elk and fish, only what is beneficial matters—there is no desire or aversion.\nHarming life shortens lifespan; the explanation lies in \"few connections\"—whose love is this?\nHaving much grain, some wish to prevent harm.\nIt is like wine in relation to man.\nMoreover, forgiving benefits others—if it is love, then only forgiveness is not governance.\nRemoving excess from the sated brings sufficiency without harm; harming the sated is like injuring an elk without a spleen.\nMoreover, there is harm before benefit in knowledge—like treating blindness in the blind.\nKnowledge sees with the eyes, and the eyes see with fire, but fire does not see.\nOnly with the five senses does knowledge last, but not appropriately.\nSeeing with the eyes is like seeing with fire.\nFire means fire’s heat, not the heat of fire.\nI have something like seeing the sun with knowledge.\nMix what is known and what is not known and ask about it—then one must say: this is what I know, and this is what I do not know.\nTaking and leaving are both possible—this is knowing both.\nWithout, as if without, there is existence and then none.\nWithout heaven’s collapse, there is none and then none.\nTo doubt without speaking is meaningless.\nZang is dead now, but in spring, obtaining Wen Wen’s death is possible.\nMoreover, it is still so.\nMoreover, moreover, it must be so.\n\nMoreover, it must cease, and it must cease.\nMoreover, ceasing only after effort is made means it must cease after effort is made.\nEquilibrium: when a hair is evenly suspended, it is light, yet if pulled taut, it snaps—this is not equilibrium.\nIn equilibrium, its snapping is no snapping at all.\nYao and Huo: some judge people by name, others by reality.\nTo praise a wealthy merchant as a friend is to judge by name.\nTo point at a leaping rabbit is to judge by reality.\nYao’s righteousness is a sound that endures to this day, while the reality of what it signifies lies in antiquity.\nIt is as precarious as standing at the city gate or at Zang’s tomb.\nA dog is a canine; to call it a \"killed dog\" is acceptable, like two things slipping free.\nAn envoy is one who is sent.\nIf I send myself, I do not send myself—yet I am still sent.\nA halberd sent is still sent; a halberd not beautiful is still sent—a halberd.\nJing’s sinking refers to carving cowrie shells.\nThus, sinking shallowly is not the same as carving shallowly.\nLike exchanging one-fifth of something, as with the transmission of a pillar’s load: when seen, its meaning remains unchanged, for prior knowledge and intent align.\nIf a pillar is lighter than autumn, its meaning becomes vast and boundless.\nHammer, mallet, and awl all serve in shoemaking—they are usable.\nTo complete embroidered shoes beyond the mallet’s work, or to complete the mallet’s work beyond embroidered shoes, is to exceed the task.\nOne contains five, and one is contained in five—twelve in total.\nNot splitting anew: advancing forward to take.\nForward, and the center remains unhalved, like a point.\nTaking from front and back, the point lies in the center.\nSplitting must halve; without giving or not halving, it cannot be split anew.\nIt may not exist, but once supplied, it must be supplied and cannot be absent.\nDuration may be finite or infinite.\nThe \"correct nine\" is nowhere it does not centrally suspend—like a game of pitch-pot.\nThe pivot of the universe cannot be singly raised—it is the cosmos.\nOne who travels first covers what is near, then what is far.\nA traveler is a traveler; they must first go near, then far.\nFar cultivation is near cultivation; priority and posteriority lie in duration.\nPeople’s cultivation must endure through time.\nOne square’s appearance exhausted, all squares share a principle yet differ—some wood, some stone—yet this does not harm their mutual alignment.\nExhausting appearances is like squares: all things are thus.\nAn ox’s madness and a horse’s frenzy differ because an ox has teeth while a horse has a tail.\nTo argue that an ox is not a horse on these grounds is untenable.\nBoth possess attributes, neither wholly possesses nor wholly lacks them.\nTo say an ox and a horse are dissimilar because an ox has horns while a horse does not is to cite dissimilar categories.\nTo claim their dissimilarity based on an ox having horns and a horse not is a reckless assertion—like an ox having teeth and a horse a tail.\nTo deny an ox is not an ox is acceptable.\nThus, to say an ox is or is not an ox is also acceptable.\nTherefore, to say \"ox-horse is not ox\" is not yet permissible, nor is \"ox-horse is ox.\"\nThus, some cases are permissible, others not—yet to say \"ox-horse is ox\" is neither permissible nor impermissible.\nMoreover, an ox is not two, a horse is not two, yet ox-horse is two.\nThus, an ox is not a non-ox, a horse is not a non-horse, yet ox-horse is neither ox nor horse—this presents no difficulty.\nThat: in rectifying names, \"that\" and \"this\" are permissible.\n\"That\" limited to \"that,\" \"this\" limited to \"this\"—\"that\" and \"this\" are not permissible.\nIf \"that\" is also \"this,\" then \"that\" and \"this\" are permissible.\nIf \"that\" and \"this\" are limited to \"that\" and \"this,\" and if they are thus, then \"that\" is also \"this\" and \"this.\"\nIn leading, there is no fault; nothing is encompassed, like a shield.\nIn harmonizing, there is no fault; it is service, unavoidable.\nTo lead without harmony is to fail to learn.\nWith little knowledge and no learning, one must remain ignorant.\nTo harmonize without leading is to fail to teach.\nWith knowledge and no teaching, merit swiftly fades.\nTo make one rob another’s clothes incurs a penalty, light or heavy.\nTo make one give another wine may be generous or meager.\nWhat is heard outside is what is unknown.\nSome say the color of one inside the room is like this color—this is knowing the unknown as if it were known.\nIt is like calling white black—who prevails?\nIt is like its color.\nIf whiteness must be white, now knowing its color is like whiteness, one knows its whiteness.\nNames clarify what is known to rectify what is unknown, not to cast doubt on what is known with what is unknown.\nLike measuring an unknown length with a ruler.\nExternally, it is intimate knowledge; within the room, it is explanatory knowledge.\nTo insist is impermissible.\nWords of coming and going are permissible—this is not insistence, so there is permissibility.\nThat person’s words are impermissible; if taken as appropriate, they must be inexact.\nOnly to say this is permissible for Huo, yet it is not that Huo—this is to affirm what is affirmed.\nWhat cannot be said should not be insisted upon.\nIf one insists on what is said, then my words do not proceed.\nIf one does not insist on what is said, then they do not proceed.\nWithout south: if finite, it can be exhausted; if infinite, it cannot.\nWhether finite or infinite is unknown, thus whether exhaustible or inexhaustible is unknown, and whether people are filled or not is unknown.\nThus, whether people can be exhausted or not is also unknown.\nYet to insist that people can be exhaustively loved is insistence.\nIf people do not fill what is finite first, then people are finite.\nExhausting the finite presents no difficulty.\nFilling the infinite means the infinite is exhausted—exhausting the finite presents no difficulty.\nNot knowing their number, how can one know the full pattern of loving the people?\nPerhaps the question is misplaced.\nTo exhaustively question people is to exhaustively love those questioned.\nIf one does not know their number yet knows the full pattern of loving them, this presents no difficulty.\nBenevolence is benevolent love.\nRighteousness is benefit.\nLove and benefit are this.\nWhat is loved and benefited is that.\nLove and benefit do not serve as inner and outer to each other; what is loved and benefited also do not serve as outer and inner.\nTo claim benevolence is internal and righteousness external, citing love and what is benefited, is a reckless assertion.\n\nIf the left eye exits and the right eye enters, this is learning—yet one may not know that learning is without benefit, hence the instruction is given: this is correct. To know that learning is without benefit is teaching; to teach that learning is without benefit is earnest. In debate and criticism, whether criticism is valid or not depends on the validity of the principle: if the principle can be criticized, even much criticism is correct; if the principle cannot be faulted, even little criticism is wrong. Now to claim that much criticism is invalid is like measuring length by shortness. Not criticizing is not criticizing oneself. Not faulting criticism is not faulting what can be faulted. What cannot be faulted is not faulting criticism. Things may be extremely long or extremely short, yet none are longer than this, none shorter than this—this is correctness. What is not this is nothing more incorrect than this. Taking high and low as the measure of good and not good is not as fitting as mountains and marshes. Dwelling in lowliness is better than dwelling in eminence, for the low is what the high requests. If not this, then this is both this and thus. Now if this pattern is in this but not in that, then this is not patterned. If this is not patterned, then it is this yet not patterned. Now if this is not patterned in this but patterned in [textual note #57], then pattern and this, patterned and not patterned, are spoken of as the same. *Mozi, Scroll Ten, Concludes*\n\n#55 Wang Yinzhi conjecturally adds the character *you* (有) after *niu* (牛). #56 *Xian Gu* omits the character *ke* (可). #57 *Yu* (於) is written as *yu* (与) in *Xian Gu*.\n\n**Mozi, Scroll Forty-Four**\n\nHeaven’s love for humanity is less than the sage’s love for humanity;\nyet its benefit to humanity surpasses the sage’s benefit to humanity.\nThe great person’s love for the petty person is less than the petty person’s love for the great person;\nyet their benefit to the petty person surpasses the petty person’s benefit to the great person.\n\nTo love Zang because he is one’s kin is not to love one’s kin;\nto benefit Zang because he is one’s kin is not to benefit one’s kin.\nTo take pleasure as beneficial to one’s child and desire it for the child is to love the child;\nto take pleasure as beneficial to one’s child and seek it for the child is not to benefit the child.\n\nWithin what the body embodies, weighing light and heavy is called *weighing*.\nWeighing is not for the sake of *this* nor against the sake of *not-this*.\nWeighing is correctness.\n\nSevering a finger to preserve the arm—\namidst benefit, one takes the greater; amidst harm, one takes the lesser.\nTaking the lesser amidst harm is not to take harm but to take benefit.\nWhat one takes is what people grasp.\n\nEncountering a bandit and severing a finger to save the body is benefit;\nthe encounter with the bandit is harm.\nSevering a finger or severing a wrist, the benefit to the world is the same—there is no choice.\nLife and death are equally beneficial; there is no choice in this.\n\nKilling one person to preserve the world is not killing one person to benefit the world.\nKilling oneself to preserve the world is killing oneself to benefit the world.\n\nAmidst affairs, weighing light and heavy is called *seeking*.\nTo seek is not *for* it.\nTaking the lesser amidst harm, seeking is for *rightness*, yet not *for* rightness.\n\nTo tell the violent of Heaven’s *this* is to affirm their nature;\nto sing to the violent of Heaven’s *not-this* is to deny their nature.\n\nWhen all those who hold fast to their positions have already acted, and I act in accordance with their positions,\nwhat they hold fast to is based on what I do.\nIf those who hold fast to their positions have not yet acted, and I act in accordance with their positions,\nthen what they hold fast to is based on what I do.\n\nThe violent person does what I do to affirm Heaven’s *not-this* as *this*—this is their nature.\nWhat cannot be corrected is corrected.\n\nTaking the greater amidst benefit is not a matter of necessity;\ntaking the lesser amidst harm is a matter of necessity.\nTaking what one does not yet possess is taking the greater amidst benefit;\nabandoning what one already possesses is taking the lesser amidst harm.\n\nRightness may be thick or thin—thicken what should be thick, thin what should be thin—this is called *ethical gradation*.\nVirtue and conduct, rulers and superiors, elders and seniors, kin and relatives—these are all to be thickened.\nTo thicken the senior is not to thin the junior.\nThicken the close.\nThick.\nThin the distant, thin.\nWhen closeness is utmost, thinness does not reach.\nRightness, though thickened for kin, does not match conduct but follows conduct.\n\nTo thicken Yu for the world is for Yu’s sake.\nTo thicken love for Yu for the world is to love as Yu’s people love.\nThickening Yu’s addition to the world does not add to Yu’s thickness in the world.\nIt is like hating the bandit’s addition to the world yet not adding to the bandit’s hatred in the world.\n\nLoving others does not exclude oneself; oneself is within what is loved.\nOneself being within what is loved, love extends to oneself.\nThe love of oneself in ethical gradation is love for others.\n\nThe sage hates illness, not peril and hardship.\nThe correct body does not move; it desires others’ benefit, not others’ harm.\n\nThe sage does not act for the sake of his chamber because of Zang’s sake—it lies in Zang.\nThe sage cannot attend to the affairs of a child.\nThe sage’s principle: when kin die, it is for the world.\nThickening kin is a matter of division—dying for them, the body thirsts for the rise of benefit.\n\nTo have thickness and thinness without ethical gradation is to rise in benefit for oneself.\n\n**Explanatory Sayings:**\nExplanatory sayings are not like the white horse—grasping the foal and seeking to explain it, Mo Di’s explanation is not so.\nThe great dance of the great fisherman is not so.\nThree things must be complete before life is sufficient.\n\nZang’s love for himself is not for the sake of those who love themselves.\nThickness does not exclude oneself.\nLove has no thickness or thinness—elevating oneself is not worthy.\nRightness is benefit; unrightness is harm.\nIntent and effect distinguish them.\n\nThere is having in the Qin horse, there is having in the horse—this is knowing the horse that comes.\nLoving the many ages is like loving the few ages.\nUniversal love is the same in this.\nLoving the present age and loving future ages are like the people of this age.\n\nGhosts are not human.\nThe elder’s ghost is the elder.\nThe world’s benefit is vast.\n\nThe sage has love but no benefit—this is Ni Ri’s saying, a guest’s saying.\nThe world has no people—this is Mozi’s saying.\nYet it remains.\nTo desire what cannot be avoided is not to desire what is not desired.\n\nIt is not killing Zang.\nKilling the bandit exclusively is not killing the bandit.\n\n**General Learning: Loving Others**\nThe small circle’s roundness is the same as the great circle’s roundness.\nWhether a square reaches a foot or does not reach a bell, its failure to reach is the same—the difference lies in near and far.\nThis is a jade tablet, this is jade.\nTo intend the pillar is not to intend the wood.\nTo intend the wood of this pillar is so.\nTo intend the person of this finger is not to intend the person.\nTo intend the capture is to intend the bird.\n\nIntent and effect cannot follow one another.\nBenefiting others is for their sake.\nEnriching people is not for their sake.\nThere is acting to enrich people.\nEnriching people is governing people—there is acting as a ghost in this.\nTo reward and praise the benefit of one person is not to reward and praise the benefit of people.\nNor does it reach the point of having no value for people.\n\nKnowing one benefit for kin is not yet filial; nor does it reach the point of knowing not to seek benefit for oneself from kin.\n\nKnowing that this world has thieves, one loves the whole world.\nKnowing that this chamber has a thief, one does not love the whole chamber.\nKnowing that one person is a thief, one does not love both persons.\nThough it be but one person who is a thief, if one does not know where he is, one detests all the weak.\n\nWhat the sages first attend to is the correspondence of name and reality.\nName and reality need not match.\nIf this stone is white, even if this stone is broken, it is entirely the same as white.\nIf this stone is only large, it is not the same as large—there is a convenience in such a designation.\n\nWhat is named by form and appearance must be known as a certain thing, and thus one knows that thing.\nWhat cannot be named by form and appearance is not known as a certain thing, yet knowing that thing is permissible.\n\nIn all matters of position and fate, whatever enters into their midst is deemed correct; to depart from them is deemed incorrect.\nIn matters of position and fate, as with those of a village or the states of Qi and Jing, all are deemed correct.\nIn matters of form and appearance, as with mountains, hills, chambers, and ancestral temples, all are deemed correct.\n\nKnowing and intent differ.\nThere are similarities: shared weight, shared tools, shared connections, shared kind, shared name, shared mound, shared Zhou, shared \"this,\" shared \"so,\" and shared root.\nThere are differences: opposition, non-conformity.\nSome differences arise from similarity; some similarities give rise to difference.\n\nOne may say: this is so and thus it is so; this is so and thus it is not so; this is change; this is force.\nDeep—make it deep; shallow—make it shallow; increase—make it increase;

Gengzhuzi said, \"Am I not yet superior to others?\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Suppose I am about to ascend the Great Pass. I have a fine steed and a sheep to drive—whom should I urge on?\"\nGengzhuzi said, \"You should urge on the fine steed.\"\nMaster Mozi asked, \"Why urge on the fine steed?\"\nGengzhuzi replied, \"The fine steed is capable of bearing responsibility.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"I also consider you capable of bearing responsibility.\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"In wisdom and intelligence, how do ghosts and spirits compare to the sage?\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"The wisdom and intelligence of ghosts and spirits surpass that of the sage as keen ears and sharp eyes surpass the deaf and blind. Formerly, King Kai of the Xia sent Fei Lian to smelt metal from the mountains and rivers and cast it into tripods at Kunwu. He then had Xi Nan divine at Bai Ku’s altar, saying: 'When the tripod is complete, with three legs and square, it will cook without fire, store without lifting, and move without being carried. It shall be offered at the ruins of Kunwu, facing upward.' The diviner’s interpretation said: 'It shall be received.' White clouds gathered, now south, now north, now west, now east. Once the Nine Tripods were completed, they were passed among the Three States. The Xia lost them, the Yin received them; the Yin lost them, the Zhou received them. The transmission among the Xia, Yin, and Zhou lasted several hundred years. If sages were to gather their worthy ministers and their most astute advisors to deliberate, could they foresee events hundreds of years hence? Yet ghosts and spirits knew them. Thus it is said: the wisdom and intelligence of ghosts and spirits surpass that of the sage as keen ears and sharp eyes surpass the deaf and blind.\"\n\nZitu Yu and Xianzi Shuo asked Master Mozi, \"In practicing righteousness, what is the greatest task?\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"It is like building a wall. Those who can build, build; those who can carry earth, carry earth; those who can tamp, tamp. Only then is the wall completed. Practicing righteousness is the same. Those who can debate, debate; those who can expound the texts, expound the texts; those who can act, act. Only then is the work of righteousness accomplished.\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"You embrace all under Heaven with love, yet no benefit is seen; I do not love all under Heaven, yet no harm is seen. Neither of us has achieved results—why do you alone affirm yourself and negate me?\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Suppose there is a fire here. One person brings water to extinguish it, while another adds fuel to intensify it. Neither has yet achieved results—whom would you value between the two?\"\nWumazi said, \"I affirm the intention of the one bringing water and negate the intention of the one adding fuel.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"I likewise affirm my intention and negate yours.\"\n\nMaster Mozi sent Gengzhuzi to Chu. Several disciples visited him, offering only three measures of grain and treating him poorly as a guest. The disciples later said to Master Mozi, \"Gengzhuzi’s stay in Chu is of no benefit. Several of us visited him, gave him only three measures of grain, and treated him poorly.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"It is not yet certain.\" Before long, Gengzhuzi sent ten pieces of gold to Master Mozi, saying, \"Your disciple dares not die in vain. Here are ten pieces of gold—I wish you to use them.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"Truly, it was not yet certain.\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"In your practice of righteousness, people do not see you grow illustrious, ghosts do not see you grow rich, yet you persist in it. You must be mad.\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Suppose you had two servants here. One acts only when he sees you; when he does not see you, he does not act. The other acts whether he sees you or not. Which of the two would you value?\"\nWumazi said, \"I would value the one who acts whether he sees me or not.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"Then you too value madness.\"\n\nA disciple of Zixia asked Master Mozi, \"Does the noble man have a state?\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"The noble man has no state.\"\nThe disciple of Zixia said, \"Even dogs and swine have a state—how can a scholar have no place?\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"Alas! Your words compare conduct to dogs and swine—alas!\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"To abandon the people of today and praise the Great Kings is to praise dry bones. It is like a carpenter who knows dry wood but not living wood.\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"All under Heaven live by the Way of the Great Kings. To praise the Great Kings is to praise the source of life for all under Heaven. To be able to praise them and not do so is not virtuous.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said, \"The jade disk of He, the pearl of Marquis Sui, the Three Thorns and Six Rarities—these are what the feudal lords call fine treasures. Can they enrich the state, increase the people, govern punishments and policies, and secure the altars of soil and grain? It is said: they cannot. What makes fine treasures valuable is their ability to benefit. The jade disk of He, the pearl of Marquis Sui, the Three Thorns and Six Rarities cannot benefit people—they are not the fine treasures of all under Heaven. Now, if one governs the state with righteousness, the people will surely increase, punishments and policies will surely be well-ordered, and the altars of soil and grain will surely be secure. What makes fine treasures valuable is their ability to benefit the people. Righteousness can benefit people, so it is said: righteousness is the fine treasure of all under Heaven.\"\n\nLord Zigao of She asked Confucius about governance, saying, \"What is it like to govern well?\"\nConfucius replied, \"To govern well is to draw near those who are distant and renew those who are old.\"\nMaster Mozi, hearing this, said, \"Lord Zigao of She did not grasp his question, and Confucius did not grasp how to answer it.\"\n\nLord Zigao of She surely knew that good governance draws near those who are distant and renews those who are old—so what did he truly ask? He asked *how* to do so. If one does not explain to others what they do not understand, but instead tells them what they already know, this is why Lord Zigao of She did not grasp his question, and Confucius did not grasp how to answer it.\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: \"When a great state attacks a small state, it is like a child playing at being a horse. When a child plays at being a horse, his legs are wearied by the effort. Now, when a great state attacks a small state, the attacking side’s farmers cannot plow, and their women cannot weave, for they must devote themselves to defense. The side under attack is likewise in chaos—its farmers cannot plow, and its women cannot weave, for they must devote themselves to the assault. Thus, when a great state attacks a small state, it is like a child playing at being a horse.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Words sufficient to be put into practice should be made constant; those sufficient to be acted upon should not be made constant. To make constant what is insufficient to be acted upon is to indulge in empty talk.\"\n\nMaster Mozi sent Guan Qianche to escort Gaoshi Zi to Wei. The Lord of Wei bestowed upon him a generous stipend and installed him in the countryside. Gaoshi Zi attended court three times and spoke exhaustively, yet none of his words were put into action. He left and went to Qi, where he saw Master Mozi and said: \"Because of you, the Lord of Wei bestowed upon me a generous stipend and installed me in the countryside. I attended court three times and spoke exhaustively, yet none of my words were put into action—this is why I left. Might the Lord of Wei now take me for a madman?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"If you left for the sake of the Dao, what harm is there in being called mad? In ancient times, the Duke of Zhou was not Guan Shu, yet he declined the Three Ducal Offices and remained in Shangyan. People all called him mad. Later generations praised his virtue, extolled his name, and it endures to this day. Moreover, I have heard that one who acts with righteousness does not avoid slander or seek praise. If you left for the sake of the Dao, what harm is there in being called mad?\"\n\nGaoshi Zi said: \"In leaving, how could I dare not act for the sake of the Dao? Formerly, you said: 'When the world is without the Dao, the humane scholar does not dwell in abundance.' Now the Lord of Wei is without the Dao, yet I coveted his stipend and rank—this would make me one who sinks others for personal gain.\"\n\nMaster Mozi was pleased and summoned Zi Qinzi, saying: \"Listen to this. I have always heard of those who turn their backs on righteousness to seek stipends, but in Gaoshi Zi, I have seen one who turns his back on stipends to seek righteousness.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"When the world’s vulgar gentlemen are poor, if you call them rich, they grow angry; if you say they lack righteousness, yet call them righteous, they rejoice. Is this not perverse?\"\n\nGong Mengzi said: \"Our ancestors had but three models.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Which ancestors do you mean when you say they had but three models? You do not understand that people had ancestors before them. If later generations turn against me, do I bear any fault? I turn against those who come after.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"This is like an army in retreat—would the stragglers seek rewards?\"\n\nGong Mengzi said: \"The gentleman does not create; he merely transmits.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Not so. Among those who are not gentlemen, in ancient times, the good were not suppressed, but today, the good do not arise. Among those of lesser quality who are not gentlemen, in ancient times, the good were not promoted, but if one had goodness oneself, one would put it into action, wishing goodness to arise from oneself. Now, to suppress and not put into action is no different from not promoting those who act. I hold that in ancient times, the good were suppressed, but today, the good should be put into action, so that goodness may increase.\"\n\nWuma Zi said to Master Mozi: \"You and I differ—I cannot practice universal love. I love the people of Zou more than those of Yue, the people of Lu more than those of Zou, the people of my village more than those of Lu, the people of my household more than those of my village, my kin more than the people of my household, and myself more than my kin, for they are closer to me. If someone strikes me, I feel pain; if they strike another, I do not feel their pain. Why should I feel distress when those close to me are not harmed, yet feel distress when those distant are harmed? Thus, I have myself and would kill others to preserve myself; I would not kill myself to benefit others.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Do you intend to conceal your doctrine, or will you proclaim it to others?\"\n\nWuma Zi said: \"Why would I conceal my doctrine? I will proclaim it to others.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"In that case, if one person approves of you, one person will want to kill you to benefit themselves; if ten people approve of you, ten people will want to kill you to benefit themselves; if the whole world approves of you, the whole world will want to kill you to benefit themselves. If one person disapproves of you, one person will want to kill you, taking you for one who spreads inauspicious words; if ten people disapprove of you, ten people will want to kill you, taking you for one who spreads inauspicious words; if the whole world disapproves of you, the whole world will want to kill you, taking you for one who spreads inauspicious words. Whether they approve of you or disapprove of you, they will want to kill you—this is what is called a mouth that brings constant calamity, a body that invites constant murder.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Do your words not seek benefit? If you speak without regard for benefit, it is empty talk.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: \"Suppose there is a man here who, when offered fine sheep, oxen, and sacrificial animals, merely has someone cut and prepare them, and finds the meal more satisfying than any other. Yet when he sees someone making a cake, he sneaks over and steals it, saying, 'Spare me your food.' Does he not know whether his days and months are sufficient, or does he have a thieving sickness?\"\n\nLord Wen of Luyang said: \"He has a thieving sickness.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Chu’s three Yi territories lie fallow and cannot all be opened; its numerous soldiers cannot all be counted. Yet when it sees the border towns of Song and Zheng, it sneaks over and steals them. Is this different from the other case?\"\n\nLord Wen of Luyang said: \"It is the same—it truly has a thieving sickness.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"When Jisun Shao and Meng Bo Chang administered the government of Lu, they could not trust one another and prayed at the forbidden shrine, saying, 'If only we could be in harmony.' This is like covering one’s own eyes and praying at the forbidden shrine, saying, 'If only I could see everything.' Is this not absurd?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said to Luo Hua Wu: \"I have heard that you delight in courage.\"\n\nLuo Hua Wu replied: \"Indeed. I have heard that in my village there is a brave man, and I must go and kill him.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"In the world, none do not desire what they love and measure what they hate. Now, when you hear there is a brave man in your village, you must go and kill him—this is not delighting in courage, but hating it.\"\n\n*End of Scroll Eleven of Mozi*\n\n*Scroll Twelve of Mozi*\n*Valuing Righteousness (Forty-Seventh)*\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Of all things in the world, none is more precious than righteousness. Suppose one were to say to another: 'I will give you caps and shoes, but I must sever your hands and feet—would you accept?' Surely one would not. Why? Because caps and shoes are not as precious as hands and feet. Or suppose one were to say: 'I will give you the world, but I must kill you—would you accept?' Again, one would surely not. Why? Because the world is not as precious as one’s own body. Yet men will contend to the death over a single word—this is to value righteousness above one’s own body. Thus it is said: Of all things in the world, none is more precious than righteousness.\"\n\nMaster Mozi, traveling from Lu to Qi, visited an old friend, who said to him: \"Nowadays, no one in the world practices righteousness. Why do you alone wear yourself out for it? You would do better to stop.\" Master Mozi replied: \"Suppose a man had ten sons, but only one tilled the fields while the other nine remained idle. The one who tilled would have to work all the harder. Why? Because many eat, but few cultivate. Now, when no one in the world practices righteousness, you should be urging me on, not trying to stop me.\"\n\nMaster Mozi journeyed south to Chu and was received by King Hui of Chu. The king, pleading age, sent Mu He to meet with him instead. Master Mozi spoke with Mu He, who was greatly pleased and said: \"Your words are truly excellent. Yet our lord is the greatest king in the world—would he not dismiss them as the work of a lowly man and refuse to adopt them?\" Master Mozi replied: \"It depends only on whether they can be put into practice. Consider medicine: the root of a common herb, if taken by the Son of Heaven, can cure his illness. Would he say, 'This is but the root of a common herb,' and refuse to take it? Now, when farmers pay their taxes to the great lords, the lords use them to prepare wine, sweet liquor, and fine grain offerings to sacrifice to the Lord on High and the spirits. Would they say, 'This is the work of lowly men,' and refuse to accept them? Thus, though a man may be lowly, when compared above to the farmer and below to the herb, is he not more valuable than the root of a common plant? Moreover, has your lord never heard the story of Tang? Long ago, when Tang was about to visit Yi Yin, he ordered the son of the Peng family to drive his carriage. Midway, the son asked: 'Where is my lord going?' Tang replied: 'I am going to visit Yi Yin.' The son said: 'Yi Yin is but a lowly man in the world. If my lord wishes to see him, he need only summon him for an audience, and Yi Yin would consider it an honor.' Tang replied: 'You do not understand.'\"\n\nHere the medicine is at hand—if one eats it, one’s ears grow sharper and one’s eyes brighter, so I would surely delight in it and force myself to take it. Now Yi Yin to our state is like a skilled physician or a potent medicine. Yet you would keep me from seeing Yi Yin—this is to wish me ill. Thereupon he dismissed the son of the Peng family and would not let him drive. Only when this was done could it be right.\n\nMaster Mozi said: In all words and deeds, whatever benefits Heaven, the spirits, and the common people, do; whatever harms Heaven, the spirits, and the common people, abandon. In all words and deeds, whatever accords with the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—do; whatever accords with the tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—abandon.\n\nMaster Mozi said: What is sufficient to guide conduct, make constant; what is insufficient to guide conduct, do not make constant. To make constant what is meant to guide conduct is to be glib.\n\nMaster Mozi said: One must rid oneself of the six biases. In silence, reflect; in speech, instruct; in action, serve. If one makes these three the charioteers of one’s three faculties, one will surely become a sage. One must rid oneself of joy, anger, pleasure, sorrow, and attachment, and employ only benevolence and righteousness. Let hands, feet, mouth, nose, and ears all be engaged in righteousness, and one will surely become a sage.\n\nMaster Mozi addressed his disciples: If one is committed to righteousness yet unable to fulfill it, one must not reject its Way. It is like a carpenter who measures but cannot cut—he must not reject his marking line.\n\nMaster Mozi said: The gentlemen of the world, when asked to govern a single hamlet, if unable, decline; yet when asked to serve as minister of a state, though unable, they accept. Is this not perverse?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Now suppose a blind man says, “What is large is white; what is black is dark.” Even one with keen eyesight could not correct him. But if you mix white and black and ask the blind man to choose, he cannot know. Thus when I say the blind man does not know white from black, it is not because of his words but because of his choice. Now the gentlemen of the world all name benevolence—even Yu and Tang could not improve upon it. Yet when benevolence and its opposite are mixed and the gentlemen of the world are asked to choose, they cannot know. Thus when I say the gentlemen of the world do not know benevolence, it is not because of their words but because of their choice.\n\nMaster Mozi said: Now in the use of one’s person, one is not as careful as a merchant with a single bolt of cloth. A merchant with a single bolt of cloth does not dare to weave carelessly but must choose the finest. Yet the scholar in the use of his person does otherwise: whatever his desires incline him to, he does. If his transgressions are grave, he incurs punishment; if slight, he suffers disgrace. Thus the scholar in the use of his person is not as careful as the merchant with a single bolt of cloth.\n\nMaster Mozi said: The gentlemen of the world wish their righteousness to be fulfilled yet resent others helping them cultivate their conduct. This is like wishing a wall to be built yet resenting others helping to construct it—is this not perverse?\n\nMaster Mozi said: The sage-kings of old wished to transmit their Way to later generations, so they wrote it on bamboo and silk, inscribed it on metal and stone, and passed it down to their descendants, wishing them to follow it. Now if one hears the legacy of the former kings yet does not act, this is to discard their transmission.\n\nMaster Mozi traveled south to the state of Wei, carrying many books in his cart. Xian Tangzi saw this and found it strange, saying: “Our Master taught Gong Shang Guo, ‘Estimate what is crooked and straight, and that is all.’ Now you carry so many books—what need is there?” Master Mozi said: “In the past, the Duke of Zhou read a hundred chapters in the morning and received seventy scholars in the evening. Thus the Duke of Zhou assisted the Son of Heaven, and his cultivation endures to this day. I above have no lord’s affairs to attend to, and below no farming hardships to endure—how dare I abandon this? I have heard that in matters of common purpose, there are often errors. Yet the people’s understanding is not uniform, which is why I carry many books. Now if one’s mind is like Guo’s, often contrary to what is subtle and refined, and in matters of common purpose one already knows the essentials, then one need not be taught with books. Why do you find this strange?”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Gong Liang Huanzi: “Wei is a small state, situated between Qi and Jin, like a poor family between rich ones. If a poor family imitates the rich in their lavish clothing and food, they will surely perish quickly. Now in your household, you adorn hundreds of carriages, feed hundreds of horses on beans and grain, and clothe hundreds of women in embroidered silks. If I took the expense of adorning carriages and feeding horses, along with the wealth spent on embroidered clothing, to support scholars, there would be enough for over a thousand. If disaster strikes, and you place a hundred men in front and several hundred behind, with hundreds of women before and after, which would be safer? I think supporting scholars is safer.”\n\nMaster Mozi served in Wei, but the one he served soon returned. Master Mozi asked: “Why have you returned?” The man replied: “He spoke to me insincerely. He said he would wait for me with a thousand measures, but gave me only five hundred, so I left.” Master Mozi said: “If he had given you more than a thousand measures, would you have left?” The man replied: “I would not.” Master Mozi said: “Then it was not because he was insincere but because he gave too little.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: The gentlemen of the world regard men of righteousness as less worthy than those carrying grain. Now suppose a man here, carrying grain, rests by the roadside, wanting to rise but unable. A gentleman sees him, regardless of age or status, and must help him up. Why? Because it is righteous.\n\nNow, when a gentleman acts for righteousness, revering and transmitting the Dao of the former kings to instruct others, even if they do not delight in it and put it into practice, they further slander and denigrate him. Thus, the gentlemen of the world regard men of righteousness as less worthy than those carrying grain.\n\nMaster Mozi said: Merchants travel in all four directions, their market prices shifting with trust and movement. Though they face the perils of passes and bridges, the dangers of bandits and thieves, they persist in their course. Yet when a scholar sits and speaks of righteousness, free from the perils of passes and bridges or the dangers of bandits and thieves—this is a matter of trust and movement beyond measure—yet they do not act. The calculation of profit by men of wealth is not as keen as that of merchants.\n\nMaster Mozi traveled north to Qi and encountered a diviner. The diviner said: “The Emperor will slay the black dragon in the north today, and your complexion is black—you must not go north.” Master Mozi paid no heed, proceeded north, and then returned. The diviner said: “I told you that you must not go north.” Master Mozi replied: “If southerners cannot go north and northerners cannot go south, and among them are those with black complexions and those with white, why do none succeed? Moreover, the Emperor slays the green dragon in the east on *jia-yi* days, the red dragon in the south on *bing-ding* days, the white dragon in the west on *geng-xin* days, and the black dragon in the north on *ren-gui* days. If we follow your words, we would forbid all movement below. This would constrict the heart and empty the world. Your words cannot be used.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “My words are sufficient for use. To abandon them and change one’s thoughts is like forsaking the harvest to cling to grain. To dismiss my words with contrary speech is like hurling eggs at a stone—even if all the eggs in the world were cast, the stone would remain unchanged, indestructible.”\n\n**Gong Meng, Forty-Eighth**\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “The gentleman holds himself in readiness; when questioned, he speaks, and when not questioned, he remains silent. It is like a bell: struck, it rings; left unstruck, it does not ring.” Master Mozi replied: “This saying contains three points, of which you now know only one, and even that, you do not fully understand. If a ruler indulges in licentious violence within the state, and one advances to remonstrate, it is called insolence; if one offers counsel through his attendants, it is called meddlesome speech. This is what perplexes the gentleman. If a ruler governs and the state faces peril, like a crossbow about to loose its bolt, the gentleman must remonstrate. Yet the ruler’s interest lies in such matters, so even if unprompted, the bell must ring. If a ruler undertakes unrighteous and aberrant conduct, even if he obtains a masterful strategy that could be employed in military campaigns to attack an innocent state, and he seizes upon it, he will surely use it. This expands territory and increases taxes and counterfeit wealth, but the outcome will bring disgrace. Neither the attacked nor the attacker benefits—both suffer harm. In such cases, even if unprompted, the bell must ring.\n\nMoreover, you say: ‘The gentleman holds himself in readiness; when questioned, he speaks, and when not questioned, he remains silent. It is like a bell: struck, it rings; left unstruck, it does not ring.’ Yet now, without being struck, you speak—does this mean you are the one who rings without being struck? Does this mean you are not a gentleman?”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “Truly good men—who does not know them? They are like fine jade, kept hidden yet brimming with inner essence. They are like beautiful women, secluded yet sought after by many. If they go forth and parade themselves, no one takes notice. Now you follow people closely and persuade them—why so laborious?”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “In this disordered age, those who seek beautiful women are many, and though the women do not go forth, people seek them in great numbers. Yet those who seek goodness are few. If one does not vigorously persuade others, no one will know. Consider two men of equal virtue here. One acts as a diviner for others, while the other remains secluded. Whose essence is greater?”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “The one who acts as a diviner for others has the greater essence.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Righteousness is the same. Those who go forth and persuade others achieve greater good. Why, then, do you not go forth and persuade others?”\n\nGong Mengzi, wearing a *zhangfu* cap, a *bohu* robe, and Confucian garb, came to see Master Mozi and said: “Does the gentleman first don his attire and then act, or does he act and then don his attire?”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “Action does not depend on attire.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “How do you know this?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “In ancient times, Duke Huan of Qi wore a tall hat and broad sash, a gold sword and wooden shield, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. Duke Wen of Jin wore coarse cloth and a sheepskin robe, a leather belt for his sword, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. King Zhuang of Chu wore a bright cap with braided tassels and a crimson robe, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. King Goujian of Yue cut his hair and tattooed his body, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. These four rulers differed in attire, yet their conduct was the same. From this, I know that action does not depend on attire.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “Well said. I have heard that dwelling on goodness brings misfortune. Let me set aside my *bohu* robe and change my *zhangfu* cap. May I see you again?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Please, let us meet as you are. If you must set aside your *bohu* robe and change your *zhangfu* cap before meeting me, then action truly depends on attire.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “The gentleman must speak the ancient language and wear ancient attire before he can be humane.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “In ancient times, King Zhou of Shang had his minister Fei Zhong, who were violent men in the world, while Jizi and Weizi were sages in the world. They spoke the same language, yet some were humane and others were not.”\n\nMaster Zhou of Dan was a sage of the world, while Guan Shu was a violent man of the world—though they wore the same attire, one was humane and the other was not. Thus, it does not lie in ancient attire or ancient language.\n\nMoreover, you emulate the Zhou but not the Xia; your \"ancient\" is not truly ancient.\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “In the ranks of the ancient sage-kings, the most sagely stood as the Son of Heaven, and the next stood as ministers and grandees. Now, Confucius transmitted the *Odes* and *Documents*, examined ritual and music, and was versed in the myriad things. Had Confucius lived in the time of the sage-kings, would he not have been made Son of Heaven?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Wisdom requires revering Heaven, serving the spirits, loving others with frugality, and uniting these as knowledge. Now you say that because Confucius transmitted the *Odes* and *Documents*, examined ritual and music, and was versed in the myriad things, he could have been Son of Heaven—this is like counting a man’s teeth to determine his wealth.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “Poverty and wealth, long life and early death, are clearly ordained by Heaven and cannot be diminished or increased.” He added: “The gentleman must study.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “To teach people to study while holding to fate is like ordering someone to wear a hat while removing his hair.”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “There is right and wrong, but no auspicious or inauspicious omens.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The ancient sage-kings all regarded ghosts and spirits as divine, capable of bringing fortune or misfortune, and thus held to auspicious and inauspicious omens. This is how they governed and their states were secure. From Jie and Zhou onward, all regarded ghosts and spirits as undivine, incapable of bringing fortune or misfortune, and thus held to no auspicious or inauspicious omens. This is how their governance fell into chaos and their states were imperiled. The former kings’ writings, which you also possess, say: ‘Arrogance, issuing from you, is inauspicious.’ This means that doing evil incurs punishment, and doing good incurs reward.”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Gong Mengzi: “In mourning rites, when the lord, parents, wife, or eldest son dies, one wears three years of mourning; for paternal uncles, brothers, and cousins, one year; for clan members, five months; for aunts, sisters, maternal uncles, and nephews, several months of mourning. Yet some, when asked about not mourning, recite three hundred *Odes*, strum three hundred *Odes*, sing three hundred *Odes*, and dance three hundred *Odes*. If we follow your words, when will the gentleman have time to attend to governance? When will the common people have time to engage in their work?”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “When the state is in chaos, govern it; when governed, then perform ritual and music. When the state is well-governed, engage in work; when wealthy, then perform ritual and music.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “When the state is well-governed, if governance is abandoned, the state’s order will also be abandoned. When the state is wealthy, it is because of work; if work is abandoned, the state’s wealth will also be abandoned. Thus, even in a well-governed state, one must encourage without ceasing—only then is it possible. Now you say: when the state is well-governed, perform ritual and music; when in chaos, govern it. This is like digging a well when choking or seeking a physician when dead. The violent kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—indulged in music and song, heedless of their people. Thus, they were punished and executed, and their states became wastelands—all following this path.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “There are no ghosts or spirits.” Yet he also said: “The gentleman must study sacrificial rites.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Holding that there are no ghosts while studying sacrificial rites is like learning guest rites without guests, or weaving a fish net without fish.”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “You consider three years of mourning wrong, yet your three days of mourning are also wrong.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “For you to deem three years of mourning wrong while upholding three days of mourning is like calling someone who carries a child disrespectful.”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “If one knows there is someone wiser than oneself, can this be called knowledge?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The foolish know there are those wiser than themselves, yet can the foolish be called wise?”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “Three years of mourning is learning to long for one’s parents.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The knowledge of an infant is merely to long for its parents. When parents cannot be obtained, it wails without ceasing—what is the reason for this? It is the height of foolishness. Then how can the Ru’s knowledge surpass that of an infant?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “I asked a Ru: ‘Why make music?’ He replied: ‘Music is for joy.’”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “You have not answered me. Now, if I ask: ‘Why build a house?’ and you say: ‘In winter to avoid the cold, in summer to avoid the heat, and to separate men and women,’ then you have told me the reason for building a house. But when I ask: ‘Why make music?’ and you say: ‘Music is for joy,’ this is like saying: ‘Why build a house?’ and answering: ‘A house is for a house.’”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Master Cheng: “The Ru’s Way is sufficient to ruin the world in four policies. The Ru regard the Dao as unclear and ghosts as undivine; Heaven and the spirits are displeased—this is sufficient to ruin the world. They also advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning, with thick coffins, multiple layers of clothing, and sending off the dead as if relocating. They wail for three years, rise only with support, walk only with a staff, ears hearing nothing, eyes seeing nothing—this is sufficient to ruin the world. They further indulge in stringed songs and dances, practicing music—this is sufficient to ruin the world. They also hold that fate exists, that poverty and wealth, long life and early death, order and chaos, safety and danger are fixed and cannot be diminished or increased. If those above act accordingly, they will not govern; if those below act accordingly, they will not work—this is sufficient to ruin the world.”\n\nMaster Cheng said: “How severe is your condemnation of the Ru!”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The Ru fundamentally do not have these four policies; if I speak of them, then it is condemnation.”\n\nNow the Ru indeed possess these four policies, yet when I speak of them, it is not slander—it comes from what I have heard in contention. Master Cheng had no reply and departed.\n\nMaster Mozi said: “He is deluded.” Returning, he later sat down and resumed, saying: “Earlier, sir, your words contained points worth hearing. Yet if one follows your reasoning, it would mean neither praising Yu nor condemning Jie and Zhou.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Not so. To respond with fitting words, to weigh arguments and act accordingly—this is wisdom. If the attack is severe, my defense is severe; if the attack is slight, my defense is slight. To respond with fitting words and weigh arguments is like shouldering a yoke to strike at a moth.”\n\nMaster Mozi debated with Master Cheng, invoking Confucius. Master Cheng said: “You are not a Ru—why invoke Confucius?”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “This is a matter of what is fitting and cannot be altered. Now, when birds sense the distress of heat and drought, they fly high; when fish sense it, they dive deep. In such circumstances, even Yu or Tang, were they to devise a plan, could not alter this. Birds and fish may be called foolish, yet even Yu and Tang would still follow their nature. Now, have I never invoked Confucius?”\n\nA visitor to Master Mozi’s gate said to him: “Sir, you regard ghosts as spiritually enlightened and capable of bringing misfortune to people…”\n\nAnother visitor to Master Mozi’s gate, strong in body and keen in thought, wished to follow and study under him. Master Mozi said: “Study for now, and I will employ you.” He urged him with kind words to learn.\n\nA year later, the student demanded employment from Master Mozi. Master Mozi said: “I will not employ you. Have you not heard the saying from Lu? In Lu, there were five brothers. When their father died, the eldest son was fond of wine and refused to bury him. The four younger brothers said: ‘If you do not bury him, we will buy you wine.’ They urged him with kind words to bury their father. After the burial, he demanded wine from his four brothers. They replied: ‘We have not given you wine yet. You buried your father, and we buried ours—was ours alone to bury? If you did not bury him, others would have ridiculed you, so we urged you to do so. Now, you act with virtue, and we act with virtue—is ours alone to be virtuous? If you do not study, others will ridicule you, so we urge you to learn.’”\n\nAnother visitor to Master Mozi’s gate, when asked by Master Mozi, “Why not study?” replied: “None in my clan studies.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Not so. Does one who loves beauty say, ‘None in my clan loves it, so I do not’? Does one who desires wealth and honor not desire it? Those who love beauty and desire wealth and honor strive for them even against others’ example. Fortune favors the good and brings misfortune to the violent. Now, I have served you for a long time, yet fortune has not come. Perhaps your words contain some flaw? Or do ghosts and spirits lack clarity? Why have I not received fortune?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Though you have not received fortune, how can my words be at fault? And how can ghosts and spirits be unclear? Have you heard of the punishment for concealing criminals?” The visitor replied: “I have not heard of it.” Master Mozi said: “Suppose there is a man here, and you have ten sons. Could you praise all ten while praising yourself just once?” The visitor replied: “I could not.” Master Mozi continued: “Or suppose there is a man here with a hundred sons. Could you praise them all your life while never praising yourself?” The visitor replied: “I could not.” Master Mozi said: “Concealing even one person is a crime. Now, the number you conceal is so great—you will incur a heavy punishment. How can you seek fortune?”\n\nMaster Mozi fell ill, and Die Bi approached to ask: “Master, you regard ghosts and spirits as clear, able to bring fortune and misfortune, rewarding the good and punishing the unvirtuous. Now, you are a sage—why are you ill? Perhaps your words contain some flaw? Or do ghosts and spirits lack clarity?” Master Mozi said: “Even if I am ill, how does that prove they are unclear? There are many ways one may fall ill: some from cold or heat, some from toil and hardship. If a house has a hundred doors but leaves one open, how can thieves not enter? The Way is the great vessel of the world—why must one force others to follow it?”\n\nSome of Master Mozi’s disciples who had returned to study archery said to him: “We wish to learn.” Master Mozi said: “You cannot. The wise must measure their strength and act only within their capacity. Even a warrior of the state, fighting while supporting another, cannot succeed. Now, you are not warriors of the state—how can you master learning and archery both?”\n\nThe disciples said to Master Mozi: “Gaozi says: ‘Your words uphold the Way, yet your conduct is deeply flawed.’ We ask to abandon you.” Master Mozi said: “You cannot. To cite my words while slandering my conduct is still better than having nothing. Suppose there is a man here—Di is deeply unvirtuous, yet he reveres Heaven, serves ghosts, and loves others. Though deeply unvirtuous, he is still better than having nothing. Now, Gaozi speaks eloquently, expounding on benevolence and the Way without slandering me. Even if Gaozi slanders you, he is still better than having nothing.”\n\nThe disciples said to Master Mozi: “Gaozi surpasses others in benevolence.” Master Mozi said: “It is not necessarily so. Gaozi’s benevolence is like a lame man claiming to be tall or a blind man claiming to be broad—it cannot last.” Gaozi said to Master Mozi: “I govern the state and administer its affairs.” Master Mozi said: “Governing requires speaking with the mouth and acting with the body. Now, you speak with your mouth but do not act with your body—this is disorder in yourself. If you cannot govern yourself, how can you govern the state’s affairs? Withdraw for now; your own self is in disorder.” Thus concludes Scroll Twelve of the Mozi.\n\n#31 Wang Niansun, referencing the *Lu Wen* chapter and the *Taiping Yulan*, adds the character \"enter\" after \"follow.\" #32 From \"Now, as for righteousness\" to this point, the *Xian Gu* edition moves it below \"those who love beauty and desire wealth and honor do not look to others yet force themselves to act.\" #33 Bi Yuan notes that the characters \"slander you\" are inverted. #34 Bi Yuan emends \"lame\" to \"limb.\"\n\n**Scroll Thirteen of the Mozi: \"Lu’s Questions\" (Forty-Ninth Chapter)**\n\nThe Lord of Lu said to Master Mozi: “I fear Qi will attack us—can we be saved?”\nMaster Mozi said: “Yes. In ancient times, the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—were mere lords of a hundred *li*, yet through loyalty and righteous conduct, they won the world. The tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—through arrogance, resentment, and violence, lost the world. I hope Your Lordship will, above, revere Heaven and serve the spirits, and below, love and benefit the people. Prepare generous gifts of furs and silk, humble your words, and present gifts to the neighboring lords on all sides. Placate the state and serve Qi—then the crisis can be averted. If not, I fear there will be nothing to be done.”\n\nWhen Qi was about to attack Lu, Master Mozi said to Xiang Ziniu: “To attack Lu is Qi’s great error. In the past, King Wu of Wu marched east to attack Yue, driving them to Mount Kuaiji; he marched west to attack Chu, forcing King Zhao into exile in Sui; he marched north to attack Qi, seizing the crown prince and returning to Wu. The feudal lords repaid his aggression, the people suffered under his labors, and refused to serve him. Thus his state was left desolate, and he himself met with execution. In the past, Zhibo attacked Fan and Zhonghang, annexing the lands of the Three Jin. The feudal lords repaid his aggression, the people suffered under his labors, and refused to serve him. Thus his state was left desolate, and he himself met with execution. Therefore, when a great state attacks a small state, it is mutual destruction—the transgression will inevitably rebound upon the state itself.”\n\nMaster Mozi said to the King of Qi: “Suppose there were a knife here, and you tested it on a man’s head, cutting cleanly through—would you call it sharp?”\nThe King said: “Sharp.”\nMaster Mozi said: “If you tested it on many heads, cutting cleanly through each time—would you call it sharp?”\nThe King said: “Sharp.”\nMaster Mozi said: “The knife is indeed sharp, but who will bear the misfortune?”\nThe King said: “The knife gains the benefit, but those who test it bear the misfortune.”\nMaster Mozi said: “To annex states, overthrow armies, and slaughter the people—who will bear the misfortune?”\nThe King lowered his head, pondered, and said: “I will bear the misfortune.”\n\nWhen Lord Wen of Luyang was about to attack Zheng, Master Mozi heard of it and stopped him, saying: “Suppose within the four borders of Lu, the great cities attacked the small cities, the great families raided the small families, killed the people, and seized their oxen, horses, dogs, pigs, cloth, silk, grain, and goods—what would you think?”\nLord Wen of Luyang said: “Within the four borders of Lu, all are my subjects. If the great cities attacked the small cities, the great families raided the small families, and plundered their goods, I would severely punish them.”\nMaster Mozi said: “Heaven encompasses all under Heaven, just as you encompass the four borders of your state. Now, if you raise troops to attack Zheng, would Heaven’s punishment not also be inevitable?”\nLord Wen of Luyang said: “Why do you stop me from attacking Zheng? My attack on Zheng accords with Heaven’s will. The people of Zheng have killed their fathers for three generations—Heaven has already punished them, making their state suffer for three years without recovery. I will assist Heaven in its punishment.”\nMaster Mozi said: “The people of Zheng have killed their fathers for three generations, and Heaven has punished them, making their state suffer for three years without recovery. Heaven’s punishment is sufficient. Now, if you raise troops to attack Zheng, saying, ‘My attack on Zheng accords with Heaven’s will,’ it is like this: Suppose a man’s son is violent and unfilial, so his father beats him. Then the neighbor’s father takes up a club and strikes him, saying, ‘I strike him in accord with his father’s will’—would this not be perverse?”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: “When you attack a neighboring state, kill its people, and seize its oxen, horses, grain, and goods, you record it on bamboo and silk, engrave it on metal and stone, cast it as an inscription on bells and tripods, and pass it down to later generations, saying: ‘None surpass us in greatness.’ Now, if a lowly man were to attack his neighbor’s household, kill its people, and seize its dogs, pigs, food, clothing, and furs, and also record it on bamboo and silk, inscribe it on ritual vessels, and pass it down to later generations, saying: ‘None surpass me in greatness’—would this be acceptable?”\nLord Wen of Luyang said: “From your words, I see that what the world calls acceptable may not necessarily be so.”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: “The gentleman of the world today knows small things but not great things. Suppose there were a man here who stole a dog or a pig—you would call him unrighteous. But if he stole a state or a city, you would call it righteous. It is like seeing a small white thing and calling it white, but seeing a large white thing and calling it black. Thus the gentleman of the world knows small things but not great things—this is what such words describe.”\n\nLord Wen of Luyang said to Master Mozi: “South of Chu there is a state called Qiao where they eat people. When the eldest son is born, they butcher and eat him, calling it ‘fitting for the younger brother.’ If the child is beautiful, they present him to their lord, and if the lord is pleased, he rewards the father. Is this not a vile custom?”\nMaster Mozi said: “Even in the customs of the Central States, it is the same. To kill a father and reward his son—how is this different from eating one’s son and rewarding his father? If one does not employ benevolence and righteousness, how can one condemn the barbarians for eating their children?”\n\nWhen the jade-worker of the Lord of Lu died, the Lord of Lu executed the one responsible, and the people of Lu praised and followed this example. Master Mozi heard of this and said: “Execution is meant to fulfill the will of the dead. Now, to follow praise and adopt it is like taking a severed head as a model for submission.”\n\nLord Wen of Luyang said to Master Mozi: “Someone told me of a loyal minister—when ordered to bow, he bows; when ordered to look up, he looks up. When at rest, he is still; when called, he responds. Can this be called a loyal minister?”\nMaster Mozi said: “When ordered to bow, he bows; when ordered to look up, he looks up—this is like a shadow. When at rest, he is still; when called, he responds—this is like an echo. What benefit will you derive from a shadow or an echo? What I call a loyal minister is one who, when his lord has faults, subtly admonishes him; when he himself has virtues, he offers them to his lord without boasting. Outwardly, he conceals his lord’s errors and brings forth his lord’s virtues, elevating them without aligning below. Thus, goodness and excellence reside above, while grievances and complaints remain below; comfort and joy belong to the lord, while sorrow and hardship fall to the minister. This is what I call a loyal minister.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu said to Master Mozi: “I have two sons—one loves learning, the other loves distributing wealth to others. Which should I make heir?”\nMaster Mozi said: “It is not yet clear. Sometimes what is rewarded may not be right. Jie’s reverence was not for bestowing fish; the mantis hunts insects, not out of love. I wish my lord would examine their intentions and achievements together.”\n\nA man of Lu sent his son to study under Master Mozi. The son died in battle, and the father reproached Master Mozi.\nMaster Mozi said: “You wanted your son to study under me. Now he has completed his studies, died in battle, and you are angry—this is like wanting to be admired, then resenting admiration when it comes. Is this not misguided?”\n\nIn the southern borderlands of Lu, there was a man named Wu Lü who made pottery in winter and farmed in summer, comparing himself to Shun. Master Mozi heard of him and went to see him.\nWu Lü said to Master Mozi: “Virtue, virtue—what need is there for words?”\nMaster Mozi said: “What you call virtue—do you also labor to aid others and share your wealth with them?”\nWu Lü said: “I do.”\nMaster Mozi said: “I have calculated this. Suppose I farmed enough to feed the world—even at my most productive, it would equal the work of one farmer. Dividing this among the world, each person would get no more than a pint of grain. Even if they gained a pint, it would not satisfy the world’s hunger—this is already clear. Suppose I wove enough to clothe the world—even at my most productive, it would equal the work of one woman. Dividing this among the world, each person would get no more than a foot of cloth. Even if they gained a foot, it would not warm the world’s cold—this is already clear. Suppose I donned armor, took up weapons, and rescued the lords from peril—even at my strongest, I would be but one warrior. One warrior cannot withstand three armies—this is already clear. Therefore, I believe it is better to recite the Dao of the former kings, seek their teachings, understand the words of the sages, and examine their expressions. First, persuade the kings, dukes, and great men; next, the common people and humble scholars. If the kings, dukes, and great men use my words, the state will surely be well-governed. If the common people and humble scholars use my words, their conduct will surely be refined. Thus, though I do not farm, I feed the hungry; though I do not weave, I clothe the cold. My merit surpasses that of those who farm to feed and weave to clothe. Therefore, though I do not farm or weave, my merit surpasses that of farming and weaving.”\n\nWu Lü said to Master Mozi: “Virtue, virtue—what need is there for words?”\nMaster Mozi said: “If the world did not know how to farm, and I taught them to farm, would my merit be greater than if I farmed alone?”\nWu Lü said: “Teaching others to farm would bring greater merit.”\nMaster Mozi said: “If I attacked an unrighteous state, beating the drum to lead the masses into battle, would my merit be greater than if I fought alone without drumming?”\nWu Lü said: “Leading the masses into battle would bring greater merit.”\nMaster Mozi said: “If the common people and humble scholars of the world, though few understand virtue, teach the world about virtue, their merit would also be great. Why not speak of it? If you could drum and advance toward virtue, would my virtue not progress further?”\n\nMaster Mozi sent Gong Shangguo to Yue. Gong Shangguo persuaded the King of Yue, who was greatly pleased and said to him: “If you can bring Master Mozi to Yue to instruct me, I will cede a territory of five hundred *li* from the former lands of Wu to enfeoff Master Mozi.”\nGong Shangguo agreed. He then prepared fifty chariots to welcome Master Mozi from Lu, saying: “I used your master’s Dao to persuade the King of Yue. The king was greatly pleased and said to me, ‘If you can bring Master Mozi to Yue to instruct me, I will cede a territory of five hundred *li* from the former lands of Wu to enfeoff him.’”\nMaster Mozi said to Gong Shangguo: “What do you make of the King of Yue’s intentions? If he will listen to my words and employ my Dao, then I will go. I will eat according to my hunger and dress according to my size, comparing myself to a humble servant—how could I accept an enfeoffment? But if Yue will not listen to my words or employ my Dao, and I go anyway, then I would be displaying virtue for show. Such display is the same in the Central States—why must it be in Yue?”\n\nMaster Mozi traveled, and Wei Yue asked: “Having met with the lords of the four directions, with whom will you speak first?”\nMaster Mozi said: “When entering a state, one must choose the most pressing matters and attend to them.”\n\nWhen a state is benighted and disordered, speak to it of exalting the worthy and unifying standards. When a state is impoverished, speak to it of frugality in expenditures and funerals. When a state is steeped in music and debauchery, speak to it of rejecting music and denying fate. When a state is licentious, perverse, and without ritual, speak to it of revering Heaven and serving the spirits. When a state is bent on aggression and domination, speak to it of universal love and condemning warfare. Thus does one “choose the most pressing matters and attend to them.”\n\nMaster Mozi departed to serve Duke Cao’s son and returned to Song after three years. Gazing at Master Mozi, he said: “When first I studied at your gate, I wore coarse cloth and ate plain broth. If I received food in the morning, I might not have it by evening, yet I still made offerings to the spirits. But under your governance, my household has grown prosperous from its beginnings. Though prosperous, I have scrupulously made offerings to the spirits. Yet my retainers die in great numbers, my livestock do not multiply, and I am mired in illness. I do not see how your Way can be put to use.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “It is not so. The spirits desire many things from men. They desire that those in high office and with generous emoluments yield them to the worthy, and that those with abundant wealth share it with the poor. Do the spirits desire only the plucking of scallions and the offering of lungs? Now you occupy high office and receive generous emoluments, yet you do not yield them to the worthy—this is one inauspicious sign. You have abundant wealth, yet you do not share it with the poor—this is a second inauspicious sign. You serve the spirits with nothing more than offerings, and then ask, ‘Why has illness befallen me?’ This is like closing only one of a hundred gates and asking, ‘How could thieves have entered?’ Seeking blessings from spirits so offended—how could it be possible?”\n\nThe Lu invocators offered a single piglet in sacrifice and sought a hundred blessings from the spirits. When Master Mozi heard of this, he said: “This cannot be. If one gives little to others yet expects much in return, others will only fear that one might bestow something upon them. Now you offer a single piglet and seek a hundred blessings from the spirits—you should fear that they will demand oxen and sheep in sacrifice. The sage-kings of old served the spirits with nothing more than offerings. Now you offer a piglet and seek a hundred blessings—your wealth would be better spent in poverty.”\n\nPeng Qingshengzi said: “The past can be known, but the future cannot.” Master Mozi said: “Suppose your parents were a hundred *li* away and you learned they had encountered danger, with only a day to reach them. If you arrived in time, they would live; if not, they would die. Now suppose you had a sturdy carriage and fine horses here, and also a broken-down cart and a team of four worn-out nags. If you had to choose, which would you take?” Peng Qingshengzi replied: “I would take the fine horses and sturdy carriage to arrive quickly.” Master Mozi said: “Then why doubt what lies ahead?”\n\nMeng Shan praised Prince Wen of Wu, saying: “When the disaster of Duke Bai befell him, the duke seized Prince Wen and pressed an axe and iron hook to his waist, pointing a spear at his heart. He said, ‘Become king, and you will live; refuse, and you will die.’ Prince Wen replied, ‘How you insult me! You killed my kin and now offer me the state of Chu in delight. Even if I gained the world by such means, it would be unrighteous—I would not do it. How much less would I accept the state of Chu?’ And so he refused. Was Prince Wen not humane?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “It was difficult, yet not truly humane. If he believed the king was without the Way, why did he not accept the throne and govern? If he believed Duke Bai was unrighteous, why did he not accept the kingship, execute Duke Bai, and restore the king? Thus I say it was difficult, yet not truly humane.”\n\nMaster Mozi sent Sheng Chuo to serve Xiang Ziniu. Xiang Ziniu thrice invaded Lu territory, and Sheng Chuo thrice followed him. When Master Mozi heard of this, he sent Gao Sunzi to request his return, saying: “I sent Chuo to assist in curbing arrogance and correcting transgressions. Now Chuo enjoys generous emoluments and deceives his master. His master thrice invades Lu, and Chuo thrice follows—this is like whipping a horse to make it bolt. I have heard that to speak of righteousness yet not practice it is to defy enlightenment. Chuo is not ignorant of this; his emoluments have overcome his sense of right.”\n\nFormerly, the men of Chu and Yue fought on the river in boats. The men of Chu advanced with the current and retreated against it; when they saw an advantage, they advanced, and when they saw no advantage, they retreated to avoid difficulty. The men of Yue advanced against the current and retreated with it; when they saw an advantage, they advanced, and when they saw no advantage, they retreated swiftly. Thus the men of Yue, though outmatched, encircled and defeated the men of Chu.\n\nGongshuzi traveled south from Lu to Chu and first devised implements for naval warfare. He made hooks and crossbows: those who retreated were hooked, and those who advanced were repelled. Measuring the length of the hooks and crossbows, he designed weapons accordingly. The men of Chu were disciplined, while the men of Yue were not, so the men of Chu, though outmatched, encircled and defeated the men of Yue.\n\nGongshuzi, pleased with his ingenuity, said to Master Mozi: “In naval warfare, I have hooks and crossbows. I wonder if your righteousness also has hooks and crossbows?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The hooks and crossbows of my righteousness surpass yours in naval warfare. My hooks and crossbows hook with love and repel with reverence. Without hooking with love, there is no intimacy; without repelling with reverence, there is haste. Familiarity without intimacy leads to swift estrangement. Thus mutual love and mutual reverence are like mutual benefit. Now you hook to restrain others, and others hook to restrain you; you repel others with force, and others repel you with force. Mutual hooking and mutual repelling are like mutual harm. Thus the hooks and crossbows of my righteousness surpass yours in naval warfare.”\n\nGongshuzi carved bamboo and wood into a magpie, which flew for three days without descending. Gongshuzi considered himself supremely skillful. Master Mozi said to him: “Your making of a magpie is not as good as my making of a linchpin. In an instant, I can carve a piece of wood three *cun* long and bear a weight of fifty *dan*.”\n\nThus, what is called \"skillful\" is that which benefits others; what does not benefit others is called \"clumsy.\"\n\nGongshuzi said to Master Mozi: “Before I met you, I desired to take Song. After meeting you, though Song is offered to me, if it is unrighteous, I will not take it.”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “Before I met you, you desired to take Song. After I met you, though I offer Song to you, if it is unrighteous, you refuse to take it—this is as if I have given Song to you. If you devote yourself to righteousness, I will further grant you the world.”\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nGongshu Ban constructed cloud-ladders for Chu, and upon their completion, intended to attack Song. Master Mozi, hearing of this, set out from Qi, traveling ten days and nights until he reached Ying, where he met Gongshu Ban.\n\nGongshu Ban asked: “What instructions do you bring, Master?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “In the north, there is one who insults me. I wish to borrow your strength to kill him.”\n\nGongshu Ban was displeased.\n\nMaster Mozi said: “I offer ten *jin* of gold.”\n\nGongshu Ban replied: “By my principles, I fundamentally do not kill people.”\n\nMaster Mozi rose and bowed twice, saying: “Allow me to explain. I have come from the north and heard that you are constructing ladders to attack Song. What crime has Song committed? Chu has surplus land but insufficient people. To kill those who are insufficient while contending for what is already in surplus cannot be called wisdom. To attack Song, which is innocent, cannot be called benevolence. To know this and not remonstrate cannot be called loyalty. To remonstrate and fail cannot be called strength. To refrain from killing the few yet kill the many cannot be called understanding categories.”\n\nGongshu Ban was convinced.\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Then, will you cease?”\n\nGongshu Ban replied: “I cannot. I have already spoken of this to the king.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Why not introduce me to the king?”\n\nGongshu Ban agreed.\n\nMaster Mozi met the king and said: “Suppose there is a man here who, possessing a fine carriage, covets his neighbor’s shabby robe; who, having millet and meat, covets his neighbor’s husks and dregs. What sort of man would this be?”\n\nThe king said: “He must have a thieving sickness.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Chu’s territory spans five thousand *li*—this is like the fine carriage compared to a broken cart. Chu has Yunmeng, filled with rhinoceroses, deer, and elk; the Jiang and Han rivers teem with fish, soft-shelled turtles, and alligators, making it the richest in the world. Song, by contrast, has no pheasants, hares, or foxes—this is like millet and meat compared to husks and dregs. Chu has tall pines, patterned catalpas, *geng* and *ge* trees, and camphorwood, while Song has no tall trees—this is like brocade compared to a shabby robe. For Your Majesty to attack Song on these three counts is of the same kind as the man I described.”\n\nThe king said: “Well said! Nevertheless, Gongshu Ban has made cloud-ladders for me, and I must take Song.”\n\nThereupon, Master Mozi met Gongshu Ban again. He untied his belt to represent a city wall and used a wooden tablet as a weapon. Gongshu Ban deployed nine variations of siege engines, and Master Mozi countered each one. When Gongshu Ban’s offensive tools were exhausted, Master Mozi’s defensive measures still had surplus.\n\nGongshu Ban, frustrated, said: “I know how to counter you, but I will not speak of it.”\n\nMaster Mozi likewise said: “I know how you intend to counter me, but I will not speak of it.”\n\nThe king of Chu asked the reason. Master Mozi said: “Gongshu Ban’s intent is merely to kill me. If I am killed, Song will have no one to defend it and can be attacked. However, my disciple Qin Guli and three hundred others are already holding my defensive tools, awaiting the Chu invaders atop Song’s walls. Even if you kill me, you cannot exterminate them.”\n\nThe king of Chu said: “Well said! I will not attack Song.”\n\nMaster Mozi returned, passing through Song. It rained, and he took shelter in a gateway, but the gatekeepers would not admit him. Thus it is said: Those who govern with spirit are unknown to the multitude for their merit; those who contend in the open are known to all.\n\n**End of Scroll Thirteen of the Mozi**\n\nThe annotations by Wang Niansun note: \"函\" should be \"亟,\" and the same applies below. #2 Wang Niansun notes: after \"非,\" the character \"此\" is missing. #3 Bi Yuan emends \"敖\" to \"败.\" #4 The *Xian Gu* edition reads \"亦\" as \"元.\" #5 The *Xian Gu* edition reads \"多吾\" as \"我多.\" #6 After \"外,\" the *Xian Gu* edition adds the character \"匡.\" #7 After \"尚,\" Bi Yuan, following the *Shang Tong* chapter, adds the character \"同.\" #8 Before \"以,\" Wang Niansun, following the *Shang Xian* chapter, adds the character \"是.\" #9 The *Xian Gu* edition, following the Wu manuscript, adds the character \"所\" before \"谓.\" #10 The *Xian Gu* edition reads \"兴\" as \"与.\" #11 Wang Niansun, following the subsequent text, emends \"翟虑耕天下而食之人矣\" to \"翟虑耕而食天下之人矣.\" #12 After \"而,\" the *Xian Gu* edition includes the character \"以.\" #13 Bi Yuan notes: after \"与,\" the character \"不\" is missing. #14 Bi Yuan emends \"不\" to \"奚.\" #15 The *Xian Gu* edition reads \"惠\" as \"息,\" and the same applies below. #16 After \"非,\" Wang Niansun, following the preceding text and the *Fei Gong* chapter, adds the character \"攻.\" #17 Before \"日,\" Wang Niansun, following the preceding text and the *Fei Gong* chapter, adds the character \"故.\" #18 Wang Niansun conjecturally emends \"萝羹\" to \"华萝之羹.\" #19 This sentence, according to the *Xian Gu* edition and Wang Niansun’s emendation, should read: \"今而以夫子之教.\" #20 The *Xian Gu* edition transposes the characters \"退其.\" #21 After \"利,\" Wang Niansun adds the character \"而.\" #22 The *Xian Gu* edition omits the character \"日.\" #23 After \"速,\" Bi Yuan conjecturally adds the character \"狎.\" #24 Wang Niansun, following the *Taiping Yulan*, emends \"翟\" to \"匠.\" #25 The *Xian Gu* edition reads \"巧\" as \"功.\" #26 The *Xian Gu* edition reads \"与\" as \"予.\" #27 Below \"舍其文轩\" and above \"邻有短褐,\" Bi Yuan, following the *Taiping Yulan*, adds twelve characters: \"邻有敝梁，而欲窃之；舍其锦绣.\" #28 Below \"方五千里,\" Bi Yuan, following the *Taiping Yulan*, adds seven characters: \"宋之地，方五百里.\" #29 Below \"为与此同类,\" the *Xian Gu* edition includes eleven characters: \"臣见大王之必伤义而不得.\" #30 After \"楚,\" the *Xian Gu* edition includes the character \"王.\"\n\n**End of Scroll Fourteen of the Mozi**\n*Defending the City Gates, Fifty-Second*\n\nQin Guli asked Master Mozi: \"According to the words of the sages, when the phoenix and crow do not appear, the feudal lords rebel against the states of Yin and Zhou, and armor and weapons arise throughout the world—great states attack small ones, the strong seize the weak. If I wish to defend a small state, what should be done?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"What kind of attack are you defending against?\"\n\nQin Guli replied: \"In the present age, the common methods of attack are: scaling ladders, grappling hooks, battering rams, siege towers, smoke, flooding, *kang*¹, *yuan*², tunnels, ant-like assaults, rolling logs, and chariots. How does one defend against these twelve methods?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Repair the city moat, prepare the defensive implements, store sufficient grain, ensure harmony between superiors and subordinates, and secure aid from neighboring feudal lords—this is how one endures. Yet even if the defenders are skilled, if the ruler does not employ them properly, it is as if the city cannot be defended. If the ruler appoints defenders but they lack ability, and the ruler still relies on them, it is as if the city cannot be defended. Thus, defenders must be both skilled and honored by the ruler before the city can be held.\n\nNow, the methods of defending a city: for the city gates, suspend *xian*⁵ mechanisms—twenty feet long and eight feet wide, with two matching sides. The crossbars⁶ should be spaced three inches apart, and earth should be packed above them, no more than two inches thick. The trench should be fifteen feet deep, its width matching the gate’s span, its length determined by available labor. At the trench’s end, suspend a basket large enough for one person. When it is full, bore holes in all gates and doors. Prepare *zi*⁸ for each: two covers, each with two layers, one bored and tied with a four-foot rope.\n\nTo counter fire chariots, shoot flaming arrows at the city gates. Bore holes in the gates to create a scaffold, plaster it, and hold water-soaked hemp ropes⁹. Use grass¹⁰ baskets to extinguish fires. Thinly reinforce the gate planks, boring holes half a foot deep, one inch apart, inserting *yi*¹¹ pegs two inches long, with one inch exposed, spaced seven inches apart, and thickly plaster them to resist fire. For each gate, suspend a water vessel to douse fires, with capacities ranging from three *dan* upward, varying in size.\n\nThe gate’s vertical posts and crossbars must be encircled with metal bands, secured with molten bronze or iron. The gate’s locking mechanism should be double-layered, reinforced with iron to ensure strength. For the bolt, make it two feet long, and the locking bar one *xian* thick. Seal it with the guard’s seal, and have someone regularly inspect the seal’s condition and the depth of the locking hole. Gatekeepers must not carry axes, adzes, chisels, saws, or mallets.\n\nOn the city walls, place a *qu* every two paces—a vertical post thirteen feet tall, with a ten-foot crossbar¹², and a six-foot shield. Every two paces, set up a *da*, nine feet wide and twelve feet long¹³. Every two paces, place one each of a long staff, long axe, and long mallet, along with twenty spears, distributed at two-pace intervals. Every two paces, station a wooden crossbow, capable of shooting over fifty paces. Prepare many arrows, avoiding bamboo shafts; *hu*, *zhao*, *pi*, and elm are acceptable. Seek iron arrowheads from Qi, and use them to shoot at enemy scaling hooks and siege towers.\n\nEvery two paces, pile stones weighing at least one *jun*, five hundred in total. If fewer, use *kang* siege plows and *bi* shields, all well-made. Every two paces, stack twenty large bamboo hats, each a full armspan in circumference and ten feet long. Every five paces, place a jar for water, with a ladle holding one *dou*. Every five paces, pile five hundred *gou shi* (dog corpses), each three feet long, tied with hemp, their ends sharpened and firmly bound. Every ten paces, stack twenty *bo* logs, each over two armspans in circumference and eight feet long.\n\nEvery twenty-five paces, set up a *#14* with an iron trough capable of holding one *dan* of stones, prepared for boiling water. Also keep sand, no less than one thousand *dan*. Every thirty paces, erect a watchtower, extending four feet beyond the parapet, three feet wide, four feet long, with planks on three sides, tightly sealed, and covered in summer. Every fifty paces, place a *jie* chariot, its wheels fitted with iron hubcaps. Every fifty paces, build a well enclosure, walled eight feet high. Every fifty paces, establish a square stronghold, secured with locks and keys. Every fifty paces, stack firewood, no less than three hundred *dan*, well covered with plaster to prevent external fire from igniting it.\n\nEvery hundred paces, construct a *long cong* siege tower, rising five *zhang* from the ground, three stories high, its base eight feet wide at the front and thirteen at the rear, tapering upward proportionally. Every hundred paces, build a wooden tower, nine feet wide at the front and seven feet high, with its axle positioned at the parapet, extending twelve feet beyond the wall. Every hundred paces, set up two *#15* and twenty *yong*, using wood to make connected striking devices.\n\nStore one hundred water vessels, each holding four *dou* to six *shi*¹⁶. Every hundred paces, pile fifty bundles of miscellaneous stalks, each over two armspans in circumference. Every hundred paces, erect a *lu* shield, four feet wide and eight feet tall. Prepare *chong shu* (battering ram techniques). Every hundred paces, place one thousand *you du* (hidden shields), three feet wide and four feet tall.\n\nEvery two hundred paces, build a watchtower within the city, twenty-five feet two inches wide and twenty feet long, extending five feet beyond the wall’s pivot. The city wall’s width should be three to four paces to allow for patrols. The parapet should be three feet wide and two feet five inches high. The steps should be two feet five inches high, three feet wide and long, with each *tang* six feet apart. At the four corners of the city wall, construct *tong yi* (child towers) five feet high, housing four officers.\n\nEvery seven feet on the wall, place a *qu*, fifteen feet long, with a three-foot *li*, five inches from the parapet. The *fu* should be twelve feet long, with a six-foot arm. Bore a hole halfway through the post, extending five inches inward. For the *fu yu*¹⁸, bore a hole in the *qu*, with the *fu*’s front end four inches below the parapet. Dig pits for the *li qu*, cover them with tiles, and in winter, use horse blankets to keep warm. All await commands, or use tiles to make pits.\"\n\nEvery thousand paces along the wall, erect a *biao* (signal pole) ten feet tall, with those responsible for draining water holding and shaking it. Every fifty paces, construct a latrine identical to those below. Those using the latrine must not carry weapons. Every thirty paces on the wall, place a *jie che* (mobile barricade cart), though it shall not be used by those in formation. Every fifty paces, build a rampway two feet five inches high and ten paces long. Every fifty paces, construct a *lou luan* (turret platform), ensuring the bolts and braces are sturdy and reinforced.\n\nEvery hundred paces, build a *shi lou* (watchtower), with its outer gate opening outward and flanked by drainage channels. For the tower, add a *jie mu* (protective screen) and extend a *zhan* (scaffold) outward to aid external defense. No chambers may be built on the wall; any structures that could provide concealment must be entirely removed. Within the inner roads at the city’s base, every hundred paces, store *ji* (straw bundles); no stockpile should hold less than three thousand *dan*, and they must be well-coated. On the wall, every ten men shall have a *shizhang* (squad leader), subordinate to one officer, one *bo wei* (cloth-armored captain).\n\nEvery hundred paces, construct a *ting* (guard post) with walls fourteen feet high and four feet thick, featuring double-leaf gates that can be secured from within. The *ting wei* (post captain) must be selected from those of orderly conduct, loyalty, trustworthiness, and competence. Two encampments share one well for cooking. Ash, chaff, firewood, fodder, and horse blankets must all be carefully stored.\n\nDefensive preparations on the wall include: *qu zhan* (drainage channels and screens), *ji che* (mobile barricades), *xing zhan* (mobile scaffolds), *xing lou* (mobile towers), *dao* (scaling ladders), *he gao* (crane-like siege engines), *lian ting* (linked shields), long axes, long hammers, long chisels, *ju* (hooked poles), *fei chong* (flying assault bridges), *xuan kou* (suspended hooks), and *pi qu* (battering rams).\n\nEvery fifty paces, build a tower with a *que nei* (sparrow’s nest) beneath the parapet. Every three feet, place a *xin gao* (firewood rack), ensuring each is two spans in circumference and four and a half feet long, with clean fuel. For tiles and stones: those weighing over two *sheng* are suitable. On the wall, every fifty paces, stockpile *she* (missile ammunition). Place iron grapnels alongside them in the same location.\n\nFor timber: logs two spans in circumference and twelve feet long or longer must have their bases well-trimmed, called *chang cong* (long supports); thirty are needed every fifty paces. Wooden bridges should be three *zhang* long, no fewer than fifty in number. When urgent repairs are required, construct a *lei bi* (rampart wall) and cover it with tiles afterward. Use ceramic jars holding ten *sheng* or more, ten every fifty paces, to store water for immediate use. Fifty-two of these are to be placed every ten paces.\n\nAt the four corners of the city wall, build high *mo si* (observation platforms) with reinforced chambers below, where observers shall stand to monitor the enemy’s movements. They must report the enemy’s formations, advances, retreats, and shifts in position; failure to do so results in execution. If the enemy digs tunnels inward, dispatch tunnel engineers to counter by digging around them, and prepare crossbows inside to respond.\n\nGather from the people’s homes any pestles, timber, tiles, or stones that can be used for city defenses and bring them up to the wall. Those who disobey orders shall be executed.\n\nWhen constructing the wall, place a *ju shu* (construction station) every seven feet and a *lei* (rampart section) every five paces. For every five *zhu* (rammed layers), use a *ti* (rammer). Long axes have eight-foot handles. Every ten paces, place a long *xian* (pike) with an eight-foot handle. Every ten paces, set a *lan* (barrier) with a long hammer, its handle six feet long and head one foot long, and axes at both ends. Every three paces, place a [missing character].\n\nThe principles of defending a besieged city are as follows: walls must be thick and high, moats deep and wide, towers and platforms well-maintained, defenses well-repaired and effective, firewood and provisions sufficient for over three months, the populace carefully selected, officers harmonious, high ministers with meritorious service to the ruler numerous, the lord trustworthy and just, and the people endlessly content. Otherwise, their ancestral graves lie here; otherwise, the abundance of mountains, forests, grasslands, and marshes provides ample resources.\n\nOtherwise, the terrain is difficult to assault yet easy to defend.\n\nOtherwise, there are deep grievances against the enemy and great merit before the ruler.\n\nOtherwise, rewards are clear and trustworthy while punishments are severe and sufficiently dreaded.\n\nWithin the city wards, households must each maintain defenses to the left, right, front, and rear, as on the city walls.\n\nIf the city is small but the populace large, relocate the elderly and weak from the outskirts into the city or a larger stronghold.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches and their assault is certain, the defenders shall first strip the city’s outer palisades, but do not burn them. While the enemy is at the walls, rotate officers and soldiers at their posts, yet do not replace the laborers; laborers must not ascend the walls.\n\nWhen the enemy is at the walls, herd all livestock into enclosures and inspect them. Plow and stockpile grain at the city’s base, one stockpile every hundred paces, each containing five hundred measures.\n\nNo buildings shall stand within the city gates. Establish a circular administrative hall for officials, with a four-foot parapet. The inner walkways shall be enclosed, secured with two crossbars and one bolt.\n\nBeyond the city’s open ground, a hundred paces from the moat, all walls, fences, trees—large and small—must be demolished and removed. Clear them away.\n\nWherever the enemy may advance—whether along narrow paths or near the city’s open ground—construct watchtowers. Erect bamboo poles at the center of the sky.\n\nBuild a great tower in the hall’s courtyard, high enough to overlook the city. The courtyard shall be open on all sides, with pathways to receive visitors. When guests await an audience, summon the three elders and left-guard officials from within to deliberate. What is to be done?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Are you asking about the defense against tunnelers?\n\nTo prepare against tunneling, construct high towers within the city for vigilance.\n\nWhen these fourteen measures are fully implemented, the people will no longer be inclined to ascend the walls. Only then can the city be defended. If even one of the fourteen is lacking, even the most skilled defenders cannot hold it.\n\n**Defense Regulations:**\nFor every fifty paces, assign ten adult men, twenty able-bodied women, and ten elderly or children—totaling forty people per fifty paces. At the base of the city walls, station one person per pace, twenty people every twenty paces. Scale these numbers according to the city’s size to ensure sufficient defense.\n\nIf the defenders press forward like a swarming ant formation, the enemy will be forewarned, and the advantage will lie with the defenders while the attackers suffer.\n\nWhen the enemy attacks in force—with a host of a hundred thousand—they shall not advance in more than four divisions. The upper guard covers five hundred paces, the middle formation three hundred, and the lower guard fifty. For any front narrower than a hundred and five paces, the defenders gain the advantage while the attackers falter.\n\nA five-hundred-pace front requires a thousand adult men, two thousand able-bodied women, and a thousand elderly or children—totaling four thousand to meet the assault. These are the numbers for defense and guard duty. Assign the elderly and children who cannot fight to guard positions on the walls not directly engaged.\n\nWhen troops depart the city, they must carry clear markers. Ensure all officers and civilians are aware of this. Any group of one hundred or more leaving without proper markers, or accompanied by unfamiliar persons, shall be treated as suspicious. Commanders of a thousand or more must halt such groups and prevent their departure. If officers or soldiers accompany them, all shall be executed, and the matter reported to the authorities. This is a critical prohibition in city defense, for it is where treachery arises—it must be scrutinized without fail.\n\n**Scouting the Enemy:**\nWatch for enemy movements. If the enemy behaves unusually—erecting walls, piling earth, or if water in wells turns unusually turbid—these are signs of tunneling. Immediately reinforce the city’s inner walls with earth directly opposite such points.\n\nDig wells within the city, one every five paces, adjacent to the city walls. On high ground, dig to a depth of a *zhang* and five *chi*; on lower ground, dig until reaching the water table at three *chi*. Order potters to craft jars holding forty *dou* or more, securing them with thin leather straps. Place these jars in the wells, and have keen-eared listeners lie prone to detect the direction of tunneling. Then dig inward to intercept the tunnels.\n\nOrder potters to craft \"moon-bright\" tubes, two *chi* and five *cun* long with a six-*wei* circumference, split lengthwise. Join the halves and place them within the tunnels, one facing upward, the other downward. Plaster the outer supports thoroughly, ensuring no gaps. Do not burn the supports; instead, plaster them well, including the joints, to prevent leaks. Repeat this on both sides, advancing together with the inner tunnel.\n\nAt the tunnel’s base, place a *kang* or *ji* (basket), but do not fill it. The *ji-kang* shall be five *bao* long, with both sides arranged symmetrically. At the tunnel’s inner mouth, construct a *ao* (kiln-like chamber) large enough to hold seven or eight bundles of mugwort. Repeat this for all tunnels, using four *mi* (bellows) per chamber.\n\nWhen the tunnel is about to be breached, strike it with a *jie-gao* (battering ram). Beat drums and discard the *zun* (vessels) to create noise. Ensure those skilled in such matters do not leave the tunnel’s mouth.\n\nJoin planks to match the tunnel’s height and width, allowing tunnelers to advance with the planks. Chisel the planks to accommodate spears, spacing them closely enough to defend the openings.\n\nIf the tunnels meet, block them with a *you* (shield). Use spears to defend the openings, preventing blockage. If an opening is blocked, reinforce the planks and relay them past the obstruction, then seal the next opening. Chisel the planks well, ensuring smoke can pass. When smoke flows freely, beat drums and discard the vessels to fill the tunnel with smoke.\n\nListen to the tunnel’s left and right, swiftly cutting off the enemy’s advance. If the enemy’s tunnel converges with yours, block it with firewood and plaster to prevent burning the planks. Thus, the enemy’s subterranean assault will fail.\n\nCut mugwort stalks to a *chi* in length and place them in the *ao* chamber. First, build a wall to face the tunnel, connecting it to the planks.\n\nDig wells adjacent to the city walls, one every three *zhang*, adjusting their placement based on the outer terrain’s width. Take care not to err. If the city’s interior is lower than its exterior, tunneling from within will be difficult.\n\nDig three or four wells on the city walls, placing newly cut wood inside. Listen from within to pinpoint the tunnel’s location, then dig to intercept it.\n\nWhen the tunnels are about to meet, prepare a *jie* cart. Use sturdy poles for the frame and equip it with sharp axes. Command three strong men to operate the *jie* cart, ramming the tunnel. Pour over ten *shi* of filth into the breach.\n\nHasten to place this in the well, with mugwort also piled above, filling seven-tenths of it. Cover the well’s mouth with a basin to prevent smoke from escaping upward, and seal the sides tightly. Beat the bellows swiftly. Transport the materials using carts.\n\nBind a bundle of firewood with hemp ropes coated in mud. Prepare an iron chain, suspending it directly opposite the enemy’s tunnel entrance. The iron chain should be three *zhang* long, with a ring at one end and a hook at the other.\n\nThe tunnel should be seven *chi* high and five *cun* wide, with pillars spaced one *chi* apart—one pillar every two *chi*. Place a base beneath each pillar, with two pillars sharing a single load-bearing block weighing eleven *jin*. Both pillars should be of the same material, supporting the crossbeam that bears the earth. The pillars should be two and a half spans in circumference, firmly bearing the earth’s weight. Ensure no pillar intersects another.\n\nDig two kilns for the tunnels, constructing them as arched chambers. Assign one officer and one attendant to each, and be sure to provide water. Seal the tunnel entrances with carts positioned on both sides, covering them with a roof. Apply mud to the top, adjusting the height and width according to the tunnel’s dimensions. Have men stand four to five *chi* inside the tunnel to secure the structure.\n\nWhen the enemy contends at the inner entrance, pivot and seal it to form a kiln. For every three enemy soldiers carrying mugwort, station one of your own men lying in wait a *chi* away. Place the mugwort to one side, guarding it with two men who must not leave their post.\n\nPrepare iron tools four and a half *chi* long, as thick as an iron *fu shuo*, with blades on both ends. Position them a *chi* away from the tunnel opening, angling them upward to strike the enemy’s center. The tools should be seven *chi* long.\n\nInside the tunnel, fashion sharp iron rings and chains, with two tunnels in operation. Dig wells on the city walls, and once the tunnel is nearly connected, stand on the planks and chisel a narrow opening. Then shift the planks and chisel another. Equip the *jie* cart with two frames, planting stakes on either side and affixing hooks at both ends.\n\nAssign fifty laborers to the tunnels, with an equal number of men and women. On the city walls, create sparrow holes, three *chi* deep and as wide as the exterior, one every five paces. The sparrow holes should accommodate a straight pole, six *chi* high at the top and three *chi* at the bottom, spaced as needed.\n\nFill the outer moat, leaving a gap of seven *chi* to suspend a beam. Where the city walls are too narrow for a moat, do not dig one. Place a deafening kiln every thirty paces on the walls, inserting five sections of *tan ju* reeds. When the drums sound below the city, light the reeds, then beat the drums again to insert the reeds into the sparrow holes, illuminating the exterior.\n\nAll *jie* carts should be fitted with iron components. The cart’s pillar should be seventeen *chi* long, with four *chi* embedded in the ground. The frame should be over three *zhang* long, up to three *zhang* and five *chi*, with a horse’s cheekpiece two *chi* and eight *cun* long. Test the cart’s strength to determine its resistance, ensuring three-quarters of its force is directed upward.\n\nFor the *jie* cart, the frame should be three *chi* long, with two-thirds of its force upward and the horse’s cheekpiece centered. The cheekpiece should be two *chi* and eight *cun* long, and the frame twenty-four *chi* long, with the lower portion unused. Reinforce the resistance using large cartwheels.\n\nThe *jie* cart’s crossbar should be twelve and a half *chi* long. All *jie* carts should be fitted with iron components, and the carts should be positioned accordingly.\n\nIf the enemy approaches the moat, construct a water conduit four *chi* deep, reinforcing it with stakes. Space them every ten *chi*, covering them with a crescent-shaped structure to await orders.\n\nTake wood two *chi* and four *cun* in circumference, split it lengthwise, place charcoal and fire inside, and seal it with the conduit. Then hurl it using the *jie* cart.\n\nFor the rapid-plow hurler, it should be two *chi* and five *cun* long, with a circumference of two *wei* or more. The lacquered *dai* is seven *cun* long, with a width of six *cun*, and its carving remains unfinished. The \"dog-runner\" is seven *cun* wide and one *chi* eight *cun* long, with fleas four *cun* long, and dog ears attached to it.\n\nMaster Mozi said: The method of defending a city requires tallying the timber within the city. What ten men can lift is called a *ten-qie*; what five men can lift, a *five-qie*. All weights are measured by the *qie* according to the number of people. For firewood and fuel, the strong have their *qie*, the weak have theirs—each proportionate to their strength. Whatever the *qie* of weight requires, the officers and people each bear their fitting share. If the city runs out of food, a great slaughter ensues.\n\nDig a great trench five paces from the city gate. On high ground, it should be three *zhang* deep; on low ground, it should reach the water table. Place traps within it, and above, construct a drawbridge with mechanical ingenuity. When filled with firewood and earth, it forms a passable path. Flanking it with trenches and ramparts prevents scaling or crossing. When the enemy approaches, the drawbridge is released, capturing them. If the enemy grows fearful and suspicious, they will scatter and disperse.\n\n**Defense Against High Assault (Fifty-Third)**\nQinzi bowed twice and asked: May I inquire—if the enemy piles earth to tower over our city, hauling firewood and soil upward to build a *yangqian*, advancing with shields and mantlets to press against the walls, while archers and crossbows ascend—what should be done?\n\nMaster Mozi replied: You ask about the *yangqian*? It is the tactic of the clumsy, sufficient only to exhaust their resources, not to harm the city. Build a defensive platform to overlook the *yangqian*, extending twenty *chi* to the left and right, with a walkway thirty *chi* long. Arm it with strong crossbows, deploy mechanical devices, and employ ingenious contraptions—thus the *yangqian*’s assault will fail.\n\n**Defense Against Overlooking with Linked Crossbows**\nUse a linked-crossbow cart, with a main shaft square and one *chi* on each side, its length matching the city wall’s thickness. It has two axles and three wheels, the wheels housed within a basket. The basket is weighted above and below. On either side stand two vertical posts, with protective posts flanking them. The protective posts are round inside, with an inner diameter of four *cun*. The crossbows are bound to the posts on both sides, their strings hooked to the main bowstring. The crossbow arms align with the basket front and back. The basket is eight *chi* high, and the crossbow axle is three *chi* five *cun* above the lower basket. The linked-crossbow mechanism is cast in bronze, weighing one *dan* and thirty *jin*. The bowstring puller is as long as a deer’s leg. The basket is three and a half *wei* in circumference, with hooks and spurs on both sides, each three *cun* square. The wheels are one *chi* two *cun* thick. The bronze spurs on the arms are one *chi* four *cun* wide, seven *cun* thick, and six *chi* long. The horizontal arms extend beyond the basket, with a span of one *chi* five *cun*, and spurs six *cun* long, three *cun* thick, matching the basket’s length. They have sights and can be adjusted up and down. The counterweight is one *dan*, made from timber five *cun* in circumference. The arrows are ten *chi* long, their tips bound with cord. They are shot like halberd darts, using a winch to draw them. The arrows rise three *chi* above the crossbow arms. Use as many crossbows as needed, with sixty arrows in circulation—no shortage of small arrows.\n\nTen men operate this cart. When the enemy approaches, construct high towers to shoot from the roads, while the city walls respond with nets and arrows.\n\n*(Sections Fifty-Four and Fifty-Five are missing.)*\n\n**Preparations Against Scaling Ladders (Section Fifty-Six)**\n\nWhen Qin Guli served Master Mozi for three years, his hands and feet grew calloused, his face and eyes were blackened by smoke, and he toiled in service without daring to voice his desires. Master Mozi, pitying him, prepared wine, dried meat, and jujubes, and sat with him beneath the shade of a great tree to rest. There, he summoned Qin.\n\nQin bowed twice and sighed. Master Mozi asked, \"What is it you desire?\" Qin bowed twice more and said, \"I venture to ask about the Way of defense.\"\n\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Not now, not now. In ancient times, there was a state of Wei that neither cherished its people within nor formed alliances without. It slighted the many with the few, and the strong with the weak. Thus, its ruler perished, its state was lost, and it became a laughingstock under heaven. You, too, must be cautious, lest you bring ruin upon yourself.\"\n\nQin bowed again, kowtowing, and begged to inquire further about the Way of defense. He asked, \"If the enemy is numerous and fierce, their allies encircle our moat, their troops advance together, their cloud ladders are deployed, their assault preparations are complete, their warriors are many, and they vie to seize our city—what is to be done?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said, \"You ask about the cloud ladders? The cloud ladder is a cumbersome device, difficult to move and adjust. In defense, construct a mobile rampart with interlocking towers encircling the city’s interior. Determine its width based on the terrain’s breadth or narrowness, and lay straw within the encirclement, but do not make it too broad. The method for the mobile rampart is this: raise it twenty *chi* high, with battlements atop, ten *chi* wide. Extend projections twenty *chi* to the left and right, matching the rampart’s height and width.\n\n\"Bore sparrow holes and set up traps outside, with mechanisms, battering rams, axes, and hooks matching the width of the ramparts. Intermix these with chisels and swords. Assign ten strong men to wield the rams and five to hold the swords. Order observers to watch the enemy’s approach, signal with drums, and shoot from both sides. Shoot repeatedly, triggering mechanisms to entangle them. From the city walls, rain down arrows, stones, sand, and burning charcoal. Pour firewood, boiling water, and hot oil to aid the defense. Enforce rewards and punishments strictly, maintaining calm as the norm, and act swiftly to prevent the enemy from devising countermeasures. Thus, the assault of the cloud ladders will be defeated.\n\n\"Construct mobile battlements, each six *chi* high in ascending tiers, with swords facing outward, released by mechanisms. If the ram approaches, retract them; if not, deploy them. Bore sparrow holes every three *chi*, ensuring that the hooks for dropping objects are firmly set. Use carts to push and pull them.\n\n\"Outside the city, ten *chi* from the walls, dig a trench ten *chi* deep. Fell all trees, large and small, cutting them at the base, and use ten-*chi* lengths as stakes. Bury them deeply and mix them together, tamping firmly to prevent removal. Every twenty paces, create a killing zone with a barrier ten *chi* thick. Each killing zone has two gates, five *chi* wide. One gate should have a shallowly buried stake, left untamped for easy removal. Align the city’s defenses with the trench gates and set up straight barriers.\n\n\"Hang fire pots every four *chi*, and place cauldrons every five paces, with furnaces and charcoal at the gates. Lure the enemy in completely, then ignite the fire to burn the gates, followed by the hanging fire pots. Stand ready with halberds, filling the width of the ramparts. Between every two halberds, place one fire pot at the gate. All should stand holding drums and torches, ready to ignite them at once. If the enemy extinguishes the fire and renews the attack, lower the fire pots again. The enemy will suffer greatly and withdraw. Then order our troops to sally forth from the hidden gates on the left and right to strike their rear, commanding valiant warriors and generals to listen for the city drums to signal their advance and retreat.\n\n\"Routinely send out troops to harass them. At midnight, raise a clamor on all four sides of the city walls. The enemy will surely be thrown into chaos, and with this, their army will be broken and their generals slain. Have our forces wear white garments and use signals to recognize one another. Thus, the assault of the cloud ladders will be defeated.\"\n\n*(Section Fifty-Seven is missing.)*\n**Preparations Against Water Attacks (Section Fifty-Eight)**\n\nSurrounding the city within the moat, construct a perimeter road eight paces wide. In preparation against water attacks, carefully assess the elevation of all four sides. Where the city’s terrain is low-lying, dig inward and downward, excavating deeply to channel spring water. Install latrine pits within tiled wells, and when the external water reaches a depth of over ten feet, bore water channels into the city.\n\nFashion ten *lin* from boats, each *lin* manned by thirty men. Each man shall wield a crossbow and carry four directional markers. Ensure the boats are well-equipped with oars and rollers. Form each twenty boats into a squadron, selecting thirty stalwart and strong men to crew each vessel—twenty of them skilled in directional markers, clad in armor and helmets, with ten wielding spears. First, house these elite troops in separate quarters, providing for their parents, wives, and children as hostages. When the water is ready to be released, deploy the *lin* with rollers to reinforce the outer embankments, while archers on the city walls provide rapid support.\n\n*(Section Fifty-Nine is missing. Section Sixty is missing.)*\n\n**Preparations Against Assaults (Section Sixty-One)**\nAt every hundred paces along the city wall, construct an assault gate. For each assault gate, build a kiln-like chamber (*yao’ao*), extending four to five feet into the gate. Erect a tiled roof above the gate to prevent rainwater from entering. The officer in charge of sealing the assault gate shall use a two-wheeled cart bound with wooden beams, plastered with clay, and secured within the gate. Measure the gate’s width to ensure the cart fits four to five feet inside. Place the *yao’ao* beside the gate, and store within it bundles of firewood and mugwort. If the enemy breaches the gate, lower the cart’s support and seal it. Sound the drum and set the kiln ablaze.\n\n**Preparations Against Tunneling (Section Sixty-Two)**\n\n**Master Qin bows twice and again bows twice, saying:**\n\"May I dare ask—of the ancients who excelled in assault, some tunneled through earth to breach the city, binding pillars and setting them aflame to collapse our walls. Once breached, the city may strike its people.\n\nThe *daxie* measures a foot in length, the flea five inches. Place two *daxie* in crosswise alignment, ensuring they lie level; if unlevel, they will not function. Both ends must be sharp.\n\nWhen tunneling troops or siege-engine troops advance, carefully assess the width of their assault formation and order the *ya* to dig counter-tunnels of equal breadth, ensuring they match the enemy’s approach. Bundle and stack timber, preparing sufficient firewood for barricades. Do not plant trees in front; instead, use logs seventeen feet long for the outer face. Arrange firewood barricades crosswise and lengthwise, then reinforce the outer face with thick plaster to prevent soil from leaking through. Ensure the counter-tunnel is wide and sturdy enough to support a city wall thirty-five feet high or more. Prop it with firewood, timber, and earth, securing it tightly.\n\nAdjust the length of the front face in advance, joining it with fleas to ensure it can bear the plaster and form a solid rampart. Plaster the exterior thoroughly to prevent burning or tearing.\n\nFor a great city, construct a postern gate fifteen feet high and four feet wide. Build an outer gate with a crossbeam—two logs placed before the gate, their ends carved to fit into sockets above. Erect a suspended beam with drunken bores, cutting through the wall to lay a plank bridge. Angle the outer bore and line it with planks, sloping it to match the city’s height.\n\nWithin the city, use existing earthworks to form outer defenses. Bore a chamber fifteen feet deep and fill it with firewood, ready to be ignited when needed. Extend listening posts along the wall, constructing double-tiered towers. Beneath these, dig into the inner side of the outer wall to a depth of fifteen feet and a width of twelve. Equip the towers—or modern listening posts—with strong men to command the defense and skilled archers to loose arrows, supported by ample supplies of broad-headed arrows.\n\nPrepare defensive platforms along the parapets, six feet high and four feet wide, all fitted with shields, crossbows, and spear racks. Install rotating crossbows: the machine six feet long, the stock one foot. Join two poles to form a roller two feet long, with a central groove for the arm, which extends to the crossbar. Place one every twenty paces, assigning skilled archers to assist, with no man leaving his post.\n\nErect a tower every hundred paces along the wall, each supported by four pillars and connected by walkways. The lower section ten feet high, the upper nine feet, with a width and depth of sixteen feet each—all reinforced for stability. Construct a bulwark every thirty paces: nine feet high, ten feet wide, eight feet tall, with a three-foot-wide bore and a two-foot depth, all secured.\n\nOn the wall, prepare fire drills, their length adjusted to the city’s height, with tinder placed at the ready. Every nine feet, station a crossbow, a halberd, a mallet, an axe, and mugwort, along with piles of three stones and surplus arrows.\n\nThe *qu* measures sixteen feet long, its shaft ten feet; the arm six feet, with a three-foot stock. Plant the *qu* no more than three feet from the parapet. The assault bridge is eight feet long and seven feet wide, its wooden frame five feet wide, with a straight central plank and ropes at both ends. When under attack, assign one man to raise and lower it, never leaving his post. Place an assault cart every twenty paces along the wall, except where troops are stationed.\n\nEvery thirty paces, set a *yao’ao* kiln. Those handling fire must use cloth, hemp sacks, and leather basins, one every ten paces. The handle is eight feet long, the container holding two *sheng* or more, up to thirty. Use worn or new cloth six feet long, with a central grip and a ten-foot handle, one every ten paces, secured with thick ropes.\n\nStation a water vessel every ten paces, each holding three *dan* or more, with varying sizes mixed together.\"\n\nBasins and ladles, two sets each. Prepare dry rations for the soldiers, two *dou* per person, to guard against overcast and rain, storing them in dry places. Order the defenders to deliver meals within the city and to the patrols outside. Prepare tools and equipment, crushing iron sand and gravel into fragments for *huai* ladles. Instruct potters to make thin jars, each holding one *dou* or more up to two *dou*, to be used immediately, bound in threes with tight bindings. Reinforce the parapets on the city wall. The assault bridges stand twelve feet high, with notches at one-foot intervals. Construct wicket gates, each with two leaves, so they may be closed independently.\n\nWhen defending against attacks on the moat, contend with fire, sounding the drums and drums of provisions. Inside and outside the ramparts, pile firewood as barriers. Set up *lingding* poles every three *zhang*, with fire hooks attached. Station one man every ten paces within the firewood, armed with crossbows at half draw, encircled by *gouxi* shields. Place a wall every seven paces.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches our city, it is an urgent and extraordinary situation. Be vigilant against tunnel attacks. If a tunnel is suspected to correspond with the enemy, dig urgently. If the tunnel is not yet breached, take care not to pursue. For countering tunnel attacks, dig a counter-tunnel every twenty paces, ten feet high and ten feet deep, following the previous method. Three feet below the surface, dig a ten-pace tunnel branching left and right, each ten feet high and wide. Place two jars level with the city wall, covering them with planks and listening through a well-like shaft. Every five paces, use barriers of pine or cypress as tunnel doors. Each door has two crossbars, both as long as the door, with rings attached. Pile stones outside the tunnel entrance to a height of seven feet, adding firewood on top. Do not construct steps or use stones; instead, use a suspended ladder for entry and exit.\n\nPrepare bellows and leather bags, the latter made of oxhide. The bellows have two jars, connected by a bridge to a drum with a hundred and ten beats. Each bag holds forty *shi* of black earth. Burn charcoal within, filling the bellows and sealing them to prevent qi from escaping. When the enemy approaches within five hundred paces of our tunnel, whether their tunnel is higher or lower, if it does not yet reach ours, use a large chisel to seek a connection. If our tunnel meets the enemy’s, encircle them without pursuit, and prepare to retreat northward, awaiting the bellows’ fire to ignite. Then withdraw and seal the tunnel to kill them.\n\nConstruct escape hatches with locks and keys, allowing free movement within. Place a dog in each tunnel; if it barks, someone is present. Assign fifty men. Inside the tunnel, create an opening for relaying messages, receiving six signals. Use oxhide to lower a measuring rope, which can be pulled or thrown. Afterward, seven men guard the retreat. In the tunnel’s center, store a large hemp rope and all tunnel tools. To obstruct tunnels, gather wood from the outer moat’s edge, scattering it to block the tunnel and probe its boundaries. Near the tunnel, prepare iron axes. Provide sufficient four-foot-long metal rods and *fulin* poles. If the enemy tunnels, counter with our own tunnel. Prepare iron hooks four feet long, in sufficient quantity, to probe and hook the enemy’s tunnel. Equip with *ju* spears, short halberds, short crossbows, and barbed arrows, all in sufficient supply, to fight within the tunnel. Use a metal sword for defense, five feet long, with a socket and wooden shaft; the shaft has a crossbar to block the enemy’s tunnel.\n\nWarn those holding jars: if the enemy’s jar weighs thirty *jin* or more, place it in the tunnel, one every *zhang*, to listen for sounds within. Dig tunnels eight feet high and wide, carefully constructing and positioning them. Prepare complete oxhide bellows, including skins and methods, to defend two tunnels. Cover the tunnel with chaff and mugwort, testing smoke penetration. Forge metal axes for chopping, with shafts three feet long, to defend four tunnels. Construct barriers to defend forty tunnels, connecting them in groups of four. Provide sufficient axes, hatchets, saws, chisels, and hoes. Forge iron fetters to defend four tunnels. Build a central shield ten and a half *zhang* high and four feet wide. Construct eight horizontal shields for the tunnel, with ropes and hemp in sufficient supply, to illuminate the tunnel. Prepare vinegar to counter smoke, protecting the eyes. Distribute vinegar in the tunnel, placing at least four *dou* in a *zhang*-sized basin. When smoked, apply vinegar to the eyes and face.\n\n**Defense Against Scaling Ladders (Chapter 63)**\nQinzi bowed twice and said: \"I venture to ask: if the enemy is strong or weak, and they scale the city walls, cutting off reinforcements first and attacking later, using the city wall as a base and digging chambers below, halting in front while archers shoot rapidly from behind—what should be done?\"\n\nMaster Mozi replied: \"Are you asking about defending against scaling ladders? Scaling ladders are the enemy’s reckless tactic. Defenders should shoot at them from the parapets, using crossbow mechanisms to strike them, pulling them down, pressing them closely, burning *da* mats to cover them, and raining down sand and stones. Thus, the scaling ladder attack will fail.\"\n\nTo defend against scaling ladders, construct suspended shields: wooden boards two *cun* thick, three feet front and back, five feet wide, and five feet high, mounted on a wheeled base with wheels sixteen *cun* in diameter. Have one person operate a twenty-four-foot-long square pole with blades at both ends, positioned within the suspended shield. Use iron rings to fasten two shields to the upper crossbar, creating a mechanism. Assign four strong men to raise and lower it without difficulty.\n\nDeploy suspended shields at intervals of twenty paces, and six paces where the attack is concentrated. Prepare *jing* shields, each two *zhang* in length and width, with a wooden upper crossbar. Bind them with wide hemp ropes, soaking the ropes in mud. Forge iron hooks to suspend them from both ends. If the enemy scales the city with ladders, burn *da* mats to cover them, linking them together, and rescue them with large nets. Use two-wheeled carts with wide axles to block them, wearing down their ends. Bind the wheels and coat them with mud.\n\nWithin the chamber, use elm or hazel wood, with brambles along the sides, naming it the \"fire barrier\" or alternatively the \"boiling broth defense,\" to counter enemy assault teams. When the enemy mounts the assault, burn the boiling broth defense, sever its cords to bring it down, and have valiant warriors follow to strike, ensuring these warriors advance first while the city walls are promptly repaired where breached.\n\nBelow the city wall, prepare \"substitute stakes\" of catalpa wood, five *chi* in length, with half their girth above ground. Carve their ends into five rows, each row spaced three *chi* apart, with three *chi* between each stake, and plant them with large ears. Construct \"linked receptacles,\" five *chi* in length and ten *chi* in width. The \"rods\" are two *chi* long and six *cun* in diameter, with cords two *chi* in length. The \"mallets\" have handles six *chi* long and heads one *chi* five *cun* in length. The \"axes\" have handles six *chi* long, with blades kept sharp, and all are buried with one side exposed.\n\nThe *da* mats are twelve *chi* in width and sixteen *chi* in length, hanging four *cun* below the front crossbar, their ends overlapping by one *chi* without forming a fish-scale pattern, and secured to the rear row. A central wooden rope, twenty-six *chi* long, is used; where the *da* mats and watchtowers do not align, fill gaps with planks. Frequently dry them in the sun. The *da* mats serve as barriers, allowing wind to pass above and below.\n\nFor damaged or suspect sections, first plant a ten-*chi* wooden stake every one *chi*, reinforcing weak points. Drive in *lülu* planks to press against the wood, with *lülu* planks eight *chi* in height, seven *cun* in width, and one *chi* one *cun* in thickness. Apply several strikes to drive them down, then secure them with upper and lower clamps. Use one *gou* rope, grain baskets, net-stones, and suspended *da* mats, ensuring stakes are planted inward rather than outward.\n\nThe \"blocking frames\" are buried four *chi* deep, with taller ones reaching ten *chi*, using wood of varying lengths. Sharpen their tops, and coat both inner and outer surfaces thickly with mud. Arrange the front row with walkways and suspended *da* mats. At the corners, construct watchtowers, which must be curved and enclosed.\n\nFor every five *bu* of earthwork, ensure no more than twenty *jing*. Dig one sparrow-hole every ten *chi*, with the lower embankment three *chi* deep, widening outward. Rotate provisions atop the city walls, including towers, dispersed supplies, and leather basins for the moat. If under rotation, attacking soldiers strike from behind, and if defenses falter, apply fire to chariot leather.\n\nThe method for repelling scaling-ladders and assaults: place *bo* barriers outside the city, ten *chi* from the wall, with a thickness of ten *chi*. The method for felling and handling timber: cut all wood, large and small, into ten-*chi* lengths, then separate and bury them deeply, tamping firmly to prevent extraction. Place one *sha* every twenty *bu*, with fill, ten *chi* thick. Each *sha* has two gates, five *bu* wide; reinforce the gate with *bo* planks and ladders, tamping to allow easy removal. On the city wall, position pounders near the *bo* gates. Hang large [items], with one *yi* every four *chi*, one *ao* every five *bu*; the *ao* gate has a furnace with charcoal.\n\nTransmit the order: once enemy troops are fully committed, set fire to the gates with chariot flames, then lower hanging fire, positioning *zai* in formation. The width accommodates the entire unit, with one fire between every two *zai*. All stand ready, awaiting the drum signal to ignite, then unleash simultaneously. If the enemy retreats from the fire only to attack again, lower the hanging fire once more—the enemy will be severely afflicted.\n\nIf the enemy retreats in disarray, order our death-soldiers to sally forth from the side gates and strike their rear guard. Command the valiant troops and the commander-in-chief to listen for the city drum’s signal to advance, and again to withdraw. Exploit this to deploy troops and set ambushes. At midnight, the city walls resound with drums and war cries on all sides, sowing chaos among the enemy, shattering their army and slaying their generals.\n\nUse [dyed] clothing as uniforms, and employ signals for mutual recognition.\n\n*Mozi*, Scroll Fourteen, concludes.\n\n**Textual Variants and Emendations**\n\n1. \"亢\" (*kàng*): *Xian Yu* (《闲诂》) reads as \"穴\" (*xué*, \"cavity\").\n2. \"麦\" (*mài*): *Xian Yu* reads as \"突\" (*tū*, \"assault\").\n3. \"服\" (*fú*): *Xian Yu* reads as \"敢\" (*gǎn*, \"dare\").\n4.

Sixty-Sixth Missing Section.\n\n**Welcoming the Enemy with Sacrifices, Sixty-Eighth**\nWhen the enemy comes from the east, meet them at the eastern altar. The altar is eight *chi* high, with eight *mi* of hall density. Eight elders of eighty years preside over the sacrifice. Eight green banners and eight green spirit tablets, each eight *chi* long, are used. Eight crossbows shoot eight times and then cease. The general’s attire must be green, and the sacrificial animal is a chicken.\n\nWhen the enemy comes from the south, meet them at the southern altar. The altar is seven *chi* high, with seven *mi* of hall density. Seven elders of seventy years preside over the sacrifice. Seven red banners and seven red spirit tablets, each seven *chi* long, are used. Seven crossbows shoot seven times and then cease. The general’s attire must be red, and the sacrificial animal is a dog.\n\nWhen the enemy comes from the west, meet them at the western altar. The altar is nine *chi* high, with nine *mi* of hall density. Nine elders of ninety years preside over the sacrifice. Nine white banners and nine plain spirit tablets, each nine *chi* long, are used. Nine crossbows shoot nine times and then cease. The general’s attire must be white, and the sacrificial animal is a sheep.\n\nWhen the enemy comes from the north, meet them at the northern altar. The altar is six *chi* high, with six *mi* of hall density. Six elders of sixty years preside over the sacrifice. Six black banners and six black spirit tablets, each six *chi* long, are used. Six crossbows shoot six times and then cease. The general’s attire must be black, and the sacrificial animal is a *xi*.\n\nFor all major sacrifices at external residences, spirit mediums may offer prayers, and sacrificial animals are provided. In observing *qi*, there is the *qi* of great generals, the *qi* of lesser generals, advancing *qi*, retreating *qi*, and defeated *qi*. Those who can discern these clearly may foretell victory or defeat, fortune or misfortune.\n\nSummon shamans, physicians, and diviners to their posts. Prepare medicines in full, house them in the palace, and provide them with proper quarters. Shamans must reside near the public altars and revere the spirits. Shamans and diviners are to request the commander’s presence only to observe *qi* and make inquiries. If they spread rumors to alarm officials and the people, investigate discreetly, pass judgment, and impose penalties without pardon. The quarters for observing *qi* should be near the commander’s office.\n\nSelect worthy grand officers, those with specialized skills, and artisans, and treat them with respect. Employ butchers and cooks in the kitchens to serve, and treat them with respect.\n\n**General Principles of Defending a City**\nThe county magistrate assumes command, dispatches guards, patrols the moats and embankments, constructs bridges and roads, and repairs the city walls. All officials contribute resources, and all artisans attend to their duties. The marshal inspects the city’s defenses and organizes the troops.\n\nSet up city gates with three persons in charge of the right gate, two in charge of the left gate, and four in charge of closing the gates, while a hundred armored soldiers stand guard. On the city walls, every step has one armored soldier and one halberdier, each assisted by three attendants. Every five steps, there is a squad leader; every ten steps, a platoon leader; every hundred steps, a company commander. Flanking them are senior officers, and in the center is the commanding general, each with their respective officers and subordinates.\n\nAt the city’s stairways, officials are stationed to guard them. In the central area, urgent matters are reported swiftly. All soldiers have their duties.\n\nOutside the city, within the range of arrows, demolish walls to prevent the enemy from using them as cover. Within thirty *li*, bring firewood, kindling, and water inside. Dogs, donkeys, pigs, and geese are to be eaten, and their bones collected to make fermented broth for the sick.\n\nWithin the city, firewood, kindling, and thatched huts—anything within arrow range—are to be removed to prevent their use as cover. Issue orders at dusk to tether dogs and horses and to weave ropes. During the quiet of night, listen for drumbeats to assess the situation, which serves to counter the enemy’s *qi* and strengthen the people’s resolve. Thus, regular assessments prevent the people from growing weary.\n\nThe invocators and scribes then make announcements to the altars of the four directions, mountains, rivers, and the soil and grain spirits. They first address military matters before withdrawing. The lord, dressed in plain clothes, takes an oath in the grand ancestral temple, saying: “These people act without the Dao, neglecting righteousness and propriety. They claim to be kings, declaring: ‘I will surely destroy your altars and annihilate your people.’ My two or three ministers, rise in the night and exert yourselves! Be diligent on my behalf, unite in purpose and strength, and defend to the death.” After the oath, the lord retires to eat. He lodges to the right of the grand ancestral temple, while the invocators and scribes lodge at the soil altar.\n\nAll officials prepare their attendants. Drums are beaten at the gatehouse, with the right side displaying the military banner and the left side displaying the standard at the corner of the training ground. Three arrows are shot to announce victory. With all five types of weapons prepared, they descend, exit the gate, and ascend to survey the outskirts. Drums are then sounded, and shortly after, the marshal shoots from the right side of the gate. Reed arrows are shot first, followed by three arrows of thatch, then bows and crossbows. From the left side of the gate, the troops first hurl javelins, followed by stones. The invocators, scribes, and ancestral officers report to the soil altar and cover the offerings with rice.\n\n**Standards and Flags, Sixty-Ninth**\nIn the art of defending a city, wood is represented by green flags, fire by red flags, firewood by yellow flags, stone by white flags, water by black flags, food by mushroom-shaped flags, dead soldiers by *cangying* flags, elite soldiers by *yu* flags, large troops by double-hare flags, five-*chi* boys by child flags, women by ladder-end flags, crossbows by dog flags, halberds by foot-soldier flags, swords and shields by feather flags, chariots by ridge flags, and cavalry by crow flags. For any flags not listed in the records, name them according to their shape.\n\nWhen flags are raised on the city walls, the officials in charge of supplies deliver resources until they are sufficient, then lower the flags.\n\n**General Principles of Defending a City (continued)**\nStones are to be stockpiled, firewood stockpiled, reeds and thatch stockpiled, *ju* and reeds stockpiled, wood stockpiled, charcoal stockpiled, sand stockpiled, pine and cypress stockpiled, *peng* and mugwort stockpiled, hemp and resin stockpiled, metal and iron stockpiled, and grain and rice stockpiled. Wells and pulleys have designated locations, hostages have residences, the five types of weapons each have their flags, and tokens each have their distinctions. Laws and decrees each have their constancy.\n\n**Section Seventy: Orders and Commands**\n\nWeights and measures each have their requests; those responsible for overseeing roads have their regulations.\n\nWatchtower officers each have their banners: poles twenty-five feet long, silk fifteen feet long, and half a bolt in width for the largest. When the enemy relays an attack at the outer edge of the moat, the city’s defenders at the corresponding sector strike the drum three times and raise one banner. When they reach the middle of the water, strike four times and raise two banners. When they reach the palisade, strike five times and raise three banners. When they reach the inner rampart, strike six times and raise four banners. When they reach the parapet, strike seven times and raise five banners. When they scale the main wall, strike eight times and raise six banners. If they climb more than halfway up the wall, the drumming continues without pause. At night, use fire signals in the same manner. When the enemy retreats, lower the banners in the same sequence as they were raised, but without drumming.\n\nThe city’s defensive mound is fifty feet long. On each of the four sides and four gates, the commanding officers are forty feet long, followed by thirty feet, twenty-five feet, twenty feet, and fifteen feet, with no height less than forty-five feet. Officers and soldiers on the city wall place their insignia on their backs, while soldiers place theirs on their heads. Officers and soldiers below the wall place theirs at eyebrow level. If stationed elsewhere, place it at the left eyebrow; the central command places theirs on the chest. Each unit has one drum, while the central command has three. Every drum is struck thirty times in three sets. All officers with drums must respond in strict order—those who fail to respond when they should, or respond when they should not, will be executed by the commander.\n\nRoads are thirty paces wide, with two stairways on either side at the base of the city wall. Wells are equipped with iron crossbows. Beyond the roads, construct screens thirty paces apart, circular and ten feet high. For civilian districts, walls must be at least twelve feet high. Those guarding the perimeter roads have gates at their centers, each guarded by two men. Without a verified token, none may pass—those who disobey are executed.\n\nAll officers, soldiers, and civilians—men and women—wear distinct badges and clothing to distinguish gender. For those guarding the sacrificial altars: after three advances and retreats, the commander summons them, rewards them with food, and presents a great banner. Record the names of those from each hundred-household village or other contributors, erecting a banner at their post so all may clearly know: \"This is the banner of so-and-so.\" The inner width of the sacrificial altar is twenty-five paces, the outer width ten paces, with length determined by terrain. Execute deserters. Train soldiers in formations—front, back, left, and right—and rotate those who are fatigued.\n\n**Section Seventy: Securing the State**\nThe Way of securing the state begins with assigning tasks according to the land. When land is used appropriately, success is achieved; when misused, labor is wasted without result. The same applies to people. If preparations are not made in advance, there is no way to secure the ruler. When officers, soldiers, and civilians are divided in purpose, the fault lies with their commanders.\n\nAll rewards, punishments, and governance must stem from meritorious service. Frequently send envoys to commend and reward those guarding border cities, passes, and frontier defenses, acknowledging the hardships of defending against barbarians. Assess whether the resources of their commanders are sufficient or lacking, whether the terrain is suitable for defense, and whether their equipment is well-stocked. In border counties and towns, if the trees are poor, use less timber; if fields are uncultivated and food scarce, avoid constructing large buildings with thatched roofs or excessive beams. If resources are abundant, the people may indulge in food.\n\nPrepare internal tallies, install plank walkways, and place equipment above them. Officers, soldiers, and attendants on the city wall all have quarters within the pathways, each assigned to their respective sectors. For every ten attendants, one is designated as the daily tally officer, responsible for verifying and guarding all gates. Gatekeepers and those enforcing prohibitions must not allow idlers to linger nearby—those who disobey are executed.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches, for a city wall a thousand yards long, the outer wall must be close to it, which benefits the defenders. If the wall is less than a thousand yards, do not engage. Observe the enemy’s position and numbers, and respond accordingly—this is the essence of defending a city. Matters not covered here should be addressed through personal vigilance and human effort.\n\nIn defending a city, inflicting casualties on the enemy with traps is paramount. Prolonging the siege to await reinforcements demonstrates mastery of defense. Those who cannot do this are unfit to defend a city.\n\nWhen the enemy is more than a hundred *li* from the city, the city commander must immediately summon all five officials and hundred-household leaders, taking the relatives of wealthy and prominent families as hostages and entrusting them with official tokens. Assign trustworthy men to guard them and act with utmost secrecy. Then, fortify the city.\n\nThe commander’s camp must have no fewer than three hundred men. For the four sides and four gates, select commanders who are meritorious officials or descendants of those who died in service, each leading a hundred soldiers. Gate commanders also guard other gates, and above each gate, construct high towers on both sides, stationing skilled archers there. Assign one person to the outer wall and one to the inner rampart, selecting those with dependents. Strike the drum every fifty paces.\n\nDivide the city’s wards into eight divisions, each with an officer. Each officer is accompanied by four men to patrol the streets and wards. For elders and minors in the wards who do not participate in defense or accounting, divide the ward into four sections, each with a leader to monitor movements. Those who wander at odd hours or behave suspiciously are to be investigated for treachery.\n\nOfficers with four or more soldiers under their command must receive a verified token from the commander. When the commander sends someone, the defender checks the token. If the token does not match or the signal is incorrect, platoon leaders and above must detain them and report to the commander. Those who fail to detain them or allow officers and soldiers to proceed will be executed.\n\nFor all crimes up to and including capital offenses, return the convicts to their parents, spouses, and siblings.\n\nFor men and women defending the city wall: every ten must have six crossbows and four other weapons. Able-bodied women, the elderly, and minors each carry one spear. If an emergency arises, the central command rapidly strikes the drum three times. All roads on the city wall, streets, and alleys within the city are to be cleared—those who move will be executed.\n\nWhen women join the main army, order the men to march on the left and the women on the right—no walking side by side. All must proceed to their assigned posts; those who disobey are executed. Those who abandon their posts are publicly denounced every three days as a precaution against treachery.\n\nThe *li* jars and all others must guard and stay overnight at the *li* gate. Officers patrol their sectors and, upon reaching the *li* gate, the jars open the gate to admit them. They patrol alongside the elders guarding the sector and inspect secluded alleys and uninhabited areas. If traitors conspire with external enemies, they are punished by *chelie*. If the jars, elders, or sector officers fail to report such conspiracies, they too are executed; if they expose the plot, they are exempted from punishment and rewarded with two *yi* of gold per person.\n\nWhen the commander dispatches inspectors to patrol the defenses, they make five circuits during long nights and three during short nights. Officers on all four sides also patrol their own sectors as the commander does; those who disobey are executed.\n\nSet up fire beacons in a grid pattern, with the fire chimneys rising four *chi* above the rooftops. Take care that no one dares cause a fire—those who do are executed. Those who intentionally start fires to create chaos are punished by *chelie*. If the five-person unit fails to report the arsonist, they are executed; if they capture the arsonist, they are exempted from punishment.\n\nFirefighters must not shout or clamor, nor may they abandon their posts to rush through blocked alleys to fight fires—those who do are executed. If jars, elders, or sector officers are guarding that alley, they may rescue the trapped, and the sector officer must immediately report to the commander. The commander dispatches trusted aides to lead the rescue. Sector officers who fail to report are executed.\n\nWomen sentenced to death or implicated in fire-related offenses are not punished unless they used the fire to incite disorder, in which case they are dealt with according to the law.\n\nStrict prohibitions during a siege: If the enemy suddenly arrives, officers and civilians must not dare to shout, gather in threes, walk side by side, exchange glances, sit and weep, gaze around, raise hands to signal, point, call out, pass by one another, follow closely, throw objects, strike one another, or press against others with their bodies or clothing. Nor may they argue or speak out of turn, or watch the enemy’s movements—those who do are executed. If the five-person unit fails to report the violation, they are executed; if they report it, they are exempted.\n\nIf a member of a five-person unit defects to the enemy, the unit is executed; if a platoon leader defects, the company officer is executed; if an officer defects, the company commander is executed. The parents, spouses, and siblings of defectors are all punished by *chelie*. Those who expose the plot beforehand are exempted.\n\nIf someone deliberately lures the enemy to a vulnerable position, they are executed. If the five-person unit fails to report it, they are executed; if they report it, they are exempted. If someone swiftly drives the enemy back from a vulnerable position, preventing them from advancing further, the two most effective units are rewarded with the highest honors.\n\nIf the siege is lifted and the city has a circumference of one *li* or more, the city commander is enfeoffed with thirty *li* of land as a *guanneihou*, the deputy commander is granted the rank of *shangqing*, and the adjutants and officers of equivalent rank are awarded the title of *wudafu*. Officers, officials, and valiant defenders who contributed to the victory—ten or more, including the five officers on the city wall—are all granted the rank of *gongcheng*. Men who defended the city are each awarded two ranks, women receive five thousand coins, and the elderly, minors, and those who previously assisted in the defense are each given one thousand coins. They are exempted from taxes for three years.\n\nThis is how officers and civilians are encouraged to defend resolutely and achieve victory in lifting the siege.\n\nOfficers and soldiers stationed at the main gate must not exceed two per unit. The bravest serve as vanguards, and the unit sits together, ensuring each knows their left, right, front, and back. Those who leave their posts without authorization are executed.\n\nThe gate captain inspects the guards three times during the day. At dusk, the drum is struck, the gate is closed, and one inspection is conducted. During the night, the commander sends someone to verify, and the names of those on duty are recorded. Meals are taken at the post; no one may eat outside.\n\nThe commander must carefully observe those who deliver messages, shield-bearers, attendants, and women serving at the front, noting their intentions, expressions, commands, and speech. When the commander eats or drinks, someone must taste the food first. If any of these actions are not requested, the offender is struck and questioned about the reason.\n\nIf the commander is displeased with messengers, shield-bearers, attendants, or women serving at the front, they may order their execution. If they resist or are bound improperly, or if the binding is delayed, they are executed. The commander must regularly warn them in advance.\n\nOfficers at the gates stand or sit morning and evening, arranged by age. Each morning and evening, they take their positions, with those of merit and ability first, followed by the rest in order. Every five days, each office reports one instance of frivolity, improper conduct, or bullying.\n\nWhen envoys from outside arrive, they must be accompanied by an escort. When they depart and return, or travel to a district, a trusted person must first prepare their lodging, then go out to greet them. Only after the gate guards verify their entry may they proceed to their lodging.\n\nSubordinates must constantly observe their superiors, following them as they move, but superiors do not follow subordinates. They must... follow. When guest soldiers guard the host’s city, or when the host provides guards for the guests, the host also guards the guest soldiers.\n\nIf garrison soldiers in the city belong to a town that has defected, take precautions and frequently inspect their posts. Do not allow those from the same town to guard the same location. Issue tallies to the officers at the stepped gates; if the tally matches, they are admitted and rewarded. If the tally does not match, they are detained, and the commander is informed. Those who ascend the city wall must wear the proper attire; any other violations are dealt with accordingly.\n\nThe night drum is kept at the main gate. At dusk, the commander orders cavalry or envoys bearing tallies to close the city, all holding *chan* weapons. At the first night drum (ten strikes), all gate and watchtower guards close their posts. Travelers are halted, and their reasons for moving are questioned; only then is their punishment carried out.\n\nAt dawn, the keeper of documents is shown, the drum is struck to allow movement, and the officers at each city gate request the keys. After the gates are opened, the keys are immediately returned. These orders do not apply when tallies or credentials are presented.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches, the watchtower drum is struck five times, followed by the perimeter drum and then the smaller drums. After five strikes of the small drum, the army halts. Commands must inspire awe, rewards must be substantial, and orders must be carried out. Once an order is issued, someone must follow up to assess its feasibility.\n\nSignals: At dusk, signals are given; those who fail to signal are punished. For defense preparations, assign designated posts—mark them as \"such-and-such post\"—and place them at street intersections, steps, or gates, so that all who pass may see and comply.\n\nAny officer, soldier, or civilian who plots to kill or wound their commander or superior shall be punished as severely as those who plot rebellion. Those who capture or report such conspirators shall be rewarded with twenty *jin* of gold and granted immunity from punishment.\n\nThose who act beyond their assigned duties or seize what they are not authorized to take shall be punished. Those who meddle in affairs outside their jurisdiction shall likewise be punished.\n\nAny officer, soldier, or civilian who trespasses into another’s jurisdiction without authorization shall be detained and handed over to the Director of Works or the patrol officer. The patrol officer shall report to the commander; those who fail to detain or who release such trespassers without authority shall be punished.\n\nThose who capture or report a rebel, a traitor who surrenders the city, or one who secretly communicates with the enemy shall, by command, be granted the remission of two death sentences and the release of four *chengdan* laborers.\n\nFor those who betray the city and flee with their parents, the parents, wives, and children of the fugitives shall be held accountable.\n\nAll civilian households must declare the quantity of their timber, thatch, and stone, specifying their dimensions and sizes. Those who fail to declare shall be punished.\n\nSoldiers and civilians stationed on the city walls shall each safeguard their immediate neighbors. If a neighbor commits an offense and one fails to report it, the next in the five-man unit shall be held liable. Those who personally capture an offender or report them to the authorities shall receive rewards. If one learns of an offense outside their own unit, the reward shall be doubled.\n\nAuthority outside the city rests with the commandant; authority within rests with the commander. If the commandant, deputy, or captain allows ten or more deserters to enter, they shall each be demoted two ranks. If one hundred or more enter, they shall be stripped of office and reduced to common soldiers for garrison duty.\n\nThose who take captives must capture enemy combatants; only then shall their actions be approved.\n\nIf civilians wish to exchange goods, grain, or other supplies, soldiers shall facilitate the trade at fair prices.\n\nIf a townsman’s acquaintance or relative commits an offense and is not within the county, but the townsman wishes to ransom them—whether with grain, money, gold, cloth, silk, or other valuables—the commandant shall permit it.\n\nMessengers shall be stationed every ten paces. Those who delay or fail to relay messages shall be punished.\n\nFor matters that may be expedited, written reports shall be sent to the commander.\n\nIf officers, soldiers, or civilians wish to report a matter, they shall submit a written request to the messenger. Those who delay or fail to report shall be punished.\n\nEach county shall submit a list of its local heroes, strategists, prominent elders, and those of great influence, along with their numbers.\n\nOfficers, soldiers, and civilians in the palace, government offices, and beneath the city walls shall all maintain fire watch, relaying vigilance to those before, behind, left, and right.\n\nIf a fire starts from a boundary wall and spreads to a neighboring wall, the responsible party shall be punished.\n\nThose who use their strength to bully the weak or young, or who forcibly violate women, or cause disturbances, shall all be punished.\n\nAt all city gates and watchtowers, carefully inspect the credentials of travelers. If a pass is suspect or absent, escort the traveler to the county office to explain their mission. Those with valid passes shall be lodged in official quarters. If acquaintances or relatives wish to visit them, summon them—do not allow them to linger in the streets.\n\nThe village elders and commander shall question the commandant, who shall respond with strict discipline. For minor matters, outsiders shall not enter the village. Village elders shall not enter private homes.\n\nOrders within the village shall be relayed by feathered signals, placed at three designated locations. Each household shall send a representative to the official post. Those who fail to relay orders or delay them shall be punished.\n\nHouseholds with defenders shall prepare meals. Officers, soldiers, or civilians without credentials who enter village lanes or government offices shall be punished, as shall officials, village elders, or commanders who neglect their duties.\n\nThose who steal official weapons, supplies, or private property worth one *qian* or more shall all be punished.\n\nOfficers, soldiers, and civilians shall each inscribe their names prominently on a placard and display it at their post. The commander shall inspect these placards. Those who enter unauthorized posts shall be punished.\n\nOn the city walls, at the first evening drum, alternate shifts shall be arranged. Those who conceal or fail to report contraband within restricted areas shall be punished.\n\nWhen officers, soldiers, or civilians die, summon their kin and bury them with the assistance of the Director of Works. Do not allow mourning to disrupt duties. Those severely wounded shall be sent home for treatment, provided with physicians, medicine, two *sheng* of wine daily, and two *jin* of meat. Officers shall frequently visit to check on their recovery; when they improve, report their condition to superiors. Those who feign injury to evade duty shall be executed along with their families.\n\nAfter the crisis, the commander shall personally visit the homes of the dead and wounded, standing at their doors in sorrow.\n\nWhen the enemy retreats and the crisis ends, perform sacrificial rites.\n\nThe commander shall, by decree, reward the county’s heroes, those who strengthened the state, and all who rendered service. He shall personally visit the homes of the dead and wounded to offer condolences and meet with the families of the fallen.\n\nWhen the siege is lifted, the commander shall dispatch envoys to commend the meritorious and tally the dead and wounded. He shall bestow ranks, emoluments, and honors upon them, elevating their status to inspire their enmity toward the enemy.\n\nSoldiers and officers on the city walls shall each safeguard their neighbors. Those who conspire to betray the city shall have their parents, wives, children, and siblings executed. Those who know of such plots but fail to capture or report them shall share the same punishment.\n\nHouseholds beneath the city walls shall mutually protect one another and report any misconduct on the walls. Those who capture or report such offenders shall be enfeoffed with a domain of a thousand households. If the capture or report comes from outside their unit, the reward shall be a domain of two thousand households.\n\nCity prohibitions: Those who do not wish to serve the enemy in minor roles or carry banners shall be punished. Those who disobey orders shall be punished. Those who issue unauthorized commands shall be punished. Those who fail to relay orders shall be punished. Those who lean on their halberds or hang them improperly, or who do not align with the ranks, shall be punished. Those who shout without cause shall be punished. Those who neglect their duties shall be punished. Those who praise outsiders while slandering their own shall be punished. Those who leave their posts to gather and gossip shall be punished. Those who arrive at their posts after the city drum sounds shall be punished.\n\nEach person shall inscribe their name on a placard and display it at their post. The commander shall personally determine the order of precedence. Those who enter unauthorized posts shall be punished.\n\nThose who leave their posts to enter other posts on the left or right, and those who fail to apprehend them, as well as those who carry private letters, make solicitations, or write letters on behalf of others, or who abandon their guard duties to attend to private affairs—along with soldiers or civilians who steal from one another’s households or abduct elders—shall all be punished without pardon. Their names shall be recorded and confiscated.\n\nThose who move about the army without a tally shall be punished. When guests are stationed below the city, though their posts may frequently change, their provisions shall not; those who praise the enemy by understating their numbers, falsely claiming disorder as order, or misrepresenting clumsy attacks as skillful shall be punished. Neither guests nor hosts may converse or lend aid to one another. If a guest shoots a letter, none may praise it; if outsiders display kindness to insiders, none may respond. Those who disobey orders shall all be punished.\n\nIt is forbidden to raise arrows with messages or to shoot letters at the enemy. Those who violate this order shall have their parents, wives, and children punished, and their own bodies displayed on the city walls. Those who capture or report such offenders shall be rewarded with twenty catties of gold.\n\nNone may move about at improper times except the commander and those bearing the credentials of the acting governor. When the commander takes position at the city, they must carefully question the elders, officials, and gentlemen, and summon those with unresolved grievances to clarify and resolve them.\n\nThe commander must personally distinguish and record those who enter, interrogate them, and if any use private grudges to harm the city or official affairs, their parents, wives, and children shall all be punished. Those who conspire with outsiders against the city shall have their three clans exterminated. Those who capture or report such offenders shall be enfeoffed with the city they guard, large or small; upon the commander’s return, their seals shall be conferred, and they shall be honored with official rank, made known to all officials, gentlemen, soldiers, and civilians.\n\nThose among the powerful and eminent who frequently associate with feudal lords shall be regularly summoned, their communications relayed upward, and they shall be treated well and entrusted. The officials in their places of residence shall repeatedly select and prepare them, ensuring they do not move about freely, and their families shall be held as hostages.\n\nLocal elders, village leaders, and the parents, wives, and children of the powerful and eminent must be honored and favored. If any poor person cannot feed themselves, the authorities shall provide for them. The parents, relatives, and wives of brave warriors shall be regularly supplied with wine and meat, treated with respect, and housed near the governor.\n\nThe commander’s tower overlooking the hostage palace must be well-secured and thoroughly plastered, ensuring those below cannot see above, while those above can see below, and none below know whether anyone is above.\n\nThe commander’s trusted associates shall recommend officials who are upright, honest, loyal, and capable of handling affairs. Their food, drink, wine, and meat shall not be restricted, and their money, gold, cloth, silk, and property shall each be guarded by themselves; they must take care not to steal from one another.\n\nThe walls of the fortified office must be triple-layered, with tiles and cauldrons stacked atop the ramparts. The gates shall have officials, with the chief stationed inside, and the gates shall be closed with mats, requiring the governor’s credentials for entry.\n\nThe guards must be selected from among the most steadfast soldiers. Trustworthy officials without malice, capable of handling affairs, shall be chosen. They shall be ordered to construct ten-foot walls around the perimeter, with gates and side gates, except for the gate of the commander’s adjutant.\n\nThe quarters of the qi-observers must be near the commander, and the shamans’ quarters near the public altar; the spirits must be revered. Shamans, invocators, and historians must report favorable omens to the people and petition the commander, who alone shall know their requests. None may collude with qi-observers to spread false or alarming words among the people; violators shall be punished without pardon.\n\nWhen provisions are insufficient, the people shall each declare their own stores, specifying the number of *shi* and *sheng* of the five grains per household. Those who conceal their stores or fail to declare them fully by the deadline, or whose declarations are found false by officials or soldiers, shall all be punished. Those who capture or report such offenders shall receive a reward of three-tenths.\n\nFor the management of grain, cloth, money, gold, and livestock, fair prices shall be set, and contracts recorded with the owners. Once the matter is concluded, the owners shall be repaid double the value. Additionally, ranks shall be awarded based on the value, quantity, and price of the goods. Those who wish to become officials shall be permitted; those who do not but wish to receive rewards, ranks, or emoluments, or to ransom relatives, acquaintances, or criminals, shall be allowed by order.\n\nThose who receive rewards shall be made to appear before the fortified officials to present them to their families. Those who wish to further assist the authorities shall have their ranks and rewards doubled.\n\n*Example records:*\n*Household of so-and-so of such-and-such village in such-and-such county, two mouths, stores six hundred *shi* of grain.*\n*Household of so-and-so of such-and-such village, ten mouths, stores one hundred *shi* of grain.*\n\nGrain must be delivered by the set date; those who fail to deliver on time shall forfeit their stores to the state. Those who capture or report such offenders shall receive a reward of three-tenths. Care must be taken that the people do not learn the extent of the city’s grain stores.\n\nWhen the commander enters the city, scouts shall be the first priority. Those captured shall be immediately employed and provided for by the authorities, without revealing the city’s defensive preparations. Scouts shall be assigned to separate offices, with their parents, wives, and children housed together, provided with clothing, food, wine, and meat, and treated well by trustworthy officials.\n\nWhen scouts return, they shall be questioned. The commander’s palace shall have three layers of defenses: an outer ring of towers at the corners, an inner ring of towers, and a covered walkway leading into the fortified palace, fifteen feet in length. The fortified palace shall have no private chambers; every three days, mats shall be unrolled to inspect it, and straw shall be spread throughout, at least three feet thick.\n\nScouts must be dispatched from among the loyal, trustworthy, and respected men of the townships, those with families. They shall be generously provided for, and their families cared for as well. Their parents, wives, and children shall be housed separately, not with the conscripts, and provided with wine and meat.\n\nOther scouts shall be sent with provisions as before. Upon their return, their reports shall be cross-examined for accuracy. Those who are rewarded three times for three accurate reports shall be generously rewarded again. Those who do not wish to receive rewards but wish to become officials shall be permitted as officials of two hundred *shi*. The commander shall personally confer their seals. Those who do not wish to become officials but wish to receive rewards or emoluments shall be treated as before.\n\nThose who penetrate deeply into the enemy’s capital and return with accurate intelligence shall be questioned thoroughly and rewarded double that of other scouts.\n\nThose who do not wish to receive rewards but desire profit shall be permitted to serve as scouts of three *shi*. When bestowing rewards upon valiant soldiers, the commander must personally deliver them to their families’ residences, allowing them to witness the commander’s commitment to duty. Those who wish to continue assisting their superiors shall have their rewards, ranks, and emoluments—as well as penalties for offenders—doubled.\n\nScouts shall not range beyond ten *li*, stationing themselves in elevated, convenient locations where they erect markers. Three men shall guard each marker. From the northernmost point to the city, three markers shall be established, aligned with the beacons on the city walls. By day, they shall raise smoke signals; by night, they shall raise fire. Upon learning the direction from which the enemy approaches, they must ascertain the enemy’s formation and determine whether an attack is imminent. For small towns incapable of self-defense and open to passage, all elders, the infirm, grain, and livestock shall be thoroughly safeguarded. No more than fifty scouts shall be dispatched, and upon the enemy’s approach, they shall be withdrawn. Take care never to grow complacent.\n\nNo more than three hundred scouts shall be assembled in a single company, sent out at dusk to perform covert duties. At empty encampments and strategic passes where people come and go, no fewer than three men shall be stationed within a *li*, maintaining vigilance on level ground. Each shall erect their marker, to which the city walls shall respond. Scouts shall advance beyond the battle-line markers, stationing themselves both outside and inside the outer gates. They shall erect markers there, positioning a small number of soldiers within the gates in such a way that their exact numbers remain unknown. Should an alarm arise and the enemy cross the battle-line markers, the city walls shall signal with a banner. Those nearby shall strike the jars in unison, and troops shall prepare for battle, following the banner’s direction. At the first sighting, one pennant shall be raised; upon entering the border, two; upon nearing the outer walls, three.\n\nWhen the enemy enters the border, raise four pennants; when they draw near the city walls, raise five. At night, use fire signals in the same manner. Clear all walls, trees, and vegetation—large and small—within a hundred paces of the outer walls. Fill all wells outside the walls to deny the enemy water. Open all filled wells and fell all remaining trees. Bring every implement that could be used to attack the city inside the walls, ensuring each person records what they bring. When the task is complete, each shall retrieve their items according to their records. Seal the transaction with a contract, documenting the exact count. If any timber cannot be brought inside, burn it to prevent the enemy from using it.\n\nHave each person inscribe their name on a large placard and display it at their post. If an official neglects their duties, they shall be punished according to the laws of excess. Those who display cowardice, strike jars in disorder, create clamor and unrest, obstruct thoroughfares, abandon their posts, or disrupt the timing of operations shall be shot. Those who incite panic among the troops shall be executed. Those who fail to remonstrate with superiors or who spread ominous words shall be executed. No one shall dare bring musical instruments or worn-out armor into the army; violators shall be shot. Without orders from the authorities, no one shall gallop in chariots, run hastily, or do so; violators shall be shot. No one shall allow cattle or horses to roam freely in the army; violators shall be shot. Those who fail to provide meals on time shall be shot. No one shall dare sing or wail in the army; violators shall be shot.\n\nCommanders shall strictly enforce punishments, executing violators. If an official witnesses a crime but fails to punish it, they shall receive the same penalty; if they allow the offender to escape, they too shall be executed. Any general who leads their troops to violate the law shall be executed. Any official who fails to ensure that soldiers, officers, and civilians hear the oaths and orders shall be punished according to the severity of their offense. When executing someone in the marketplace, the executioner shall proceed with their eyes open.\n\nThe heralds shall wait outside the commander’s gate, forming two ranks seated on either side, taking turns to eat without interruption. One senior herald shall be stationed at the gate, and the commander shall frequently send messengers to inspect for deserters, reporting them to the gate captain and their superiors. Deserters shall be reported upon their return.\n\nFour men shall sit inside the commander’s gate, two on each side, and two shall sit outside the side gate. When visitors arrive, they shall stand armed in front, taking turns to eat, and announce the names of those attending. The commander’s chamber shall have a high tower, where sentinels shall watch for approaching chariots or cavalry on the roads outside, as well as any unusual activity within the city, immediately reporting to the commander.\n\nThe commander shall verify reports from the city walls, gate sentinels, and local officials. Those at the base of the tower shall receive the sentinels’ reports and relay them to the commander. Two attendants shall sit inside the side gate, with the gate kept ajar, taking turns to eat; one shall be a senior attendant. Patrol the streets around the commander’s palace, establishing guard posts along the roads, each with walls on both sides ten feet high, topped with battlements for observation. Place initial markers shaped like chicken feet, flanking the path to inspect provisions.\n\nCarefully examine and verify all written records, comparing them with the provisions. If discrepancies arise, investigate and rectify them. Outside the guard post walls, fortify the streets with towers overlooking the alleys, each tower equipped with a drum and a large bell. If an incident occurs, sound the drum, and officials shall arrive to address it. At night, use fire to indicate the drum’s location.\n\nConstruct latrines every fifty paces along the city walls, identical in design to those above. For those guilty of minor offenses deserving leniency, have them clean the latrines as punishment.\n\n---\n\n**Section Seventy-One: Miscellaneous Defenses**\n\nQinzi asked: When the enemy is numerous, bold, and eager to display their might to intimidate the defenders, advancing with firewood and earth to build *yangling* ramps, piling soil to tower over the people, pushing forward with shields, linking them to the city walls, and mounting siege engines and crossbows, what should be done?\n\nMozi replied: Are you asking about defending against *yangling* ramps? The *yangling* is a crude siege tactic, sufficient to exhaust troops but not to breach the city. Its effectiveness depends on distance: the farther the attack, the farther the harm; the closer to the city, the nearer the harm—but it will not reach the walls. Without respite, arrows and stones shall rain down, with archers moving swiftly to shoot from all sides. Use *lan* as rear supports, and maintain vigilance to fortify defenses.\n\nSharpen the resolve of our elite troops, ensuring they do not falter. Defenders shall hold their ground firmly, while attackers shall advance recklessly. Cultivate courage and high morale, and the people’s resolve shall multiply a hundredfold. With many holding their positions and few wavering, we shall not be endangered. If the troops do not rest, they cannot be withstood; once the enemy links their ramps to the city, counter them with the method for defending against cloud ladders.\n\nFor all defenses against smoke, battering rams, cloud ladders, and siege towers: if the city walls are insufficient, reinforce them with wooden beams. Place them a hundred paces to the left and right, and continuously hurl stones, sand, and charcoal upon the enemy like rain. Use firewood, flames, boiling water, and hot liquid to repel them.\n\nSelect and deploy elite troops, ensuring they do not falter. Clearly reward and punish, maintaining calm as the foundation, and act swiftly without allowing the commander to waver in resolve or the people’s morale to falter. With abundant rewards and strict discipline, the troops shall not grow weary. Battering rams, siege towers, and ladders shall all be countered with counter-rams.\n\nThe *qu* trench shall be fifteen feet long, with three feet buried underground, and arrows twelve feet long. The trench shall be sixteen feet wide, with a twelve-foot inner section and a four-foot overhang. Plant the *qu* without branches within five inches of the top. Place one ladder every ten feet along the *qu*. The number of *qu* answers: 258 per *li*, and 129 *qu* answers.\n\nOn all outer roads that can be fortified to hinder the enemy, construct three watchtowers where the threat is greatest, each with three corners, arranged like the Weaving Maid constellation to enable mutual support. On all mounds, forests, ravines, hills, ridges, outer gates, and intersections, establish checkpoints and minor posts to monitor the number of enemy movements and their hidden positions.\n\nTo protect the people, first survey all official residences, civilian homes, offices, and buildings within the city, large and small, and assign them to defenders. Allow those who wish to defend alongside brothers or acquaintances to do so. Bring grain, livestock, property, and all resources that can aid the city’s defense from outer residences into the city. If the situation grows urgent, have them stored inside the gates.\n\nScouts shall number no more than fifty. When the enemy approaches, they shall withdraw in accordance with the signals, with only the most essential remaining. The people shall contribute grain, cloth, silk, gold, money, oxen, horses, and livestock, all to be valued at fair prices and recorded in contracts with their owners.\n\nAssign each person according to their strengths. When the affairs of the realm are properly ordered, duties shall be evenly distributed, and all shall find contentment in their tasks. When the realm’s affairs are well-prepared, the strong and weak shall be accounted for, and all matters shall be in readiness.\n\nWatchtowers for defense shall be built round, rising over three *zhang* in height, with platforms arranged for counterattacks. Construct scaling ladders with arms three *chi* long, extending three *chi* from the gates, secured with ropes. Dig double trenches and suspend planks as bridges.\n\nAt each watchtower, station one drum. For enemy signals, alarm signals, and disorder signals, transmit the fire beacons in sequence until reaching the ruler’s capital. In urgent matters, raise or lower the signals accordingly. When beacons are lit, beat the drums five times in succession, repeating the signal to indicate the enemy’s numbers and direction. Report daily and relay the sequence of signals without fail.\n\nUpon sighting the enemy, raise one beacon; upon their entry into the territory, raise two; if they besiege the outer walls, raise three beacons and one banner; if they gather at the outer city, raise four beacons and two banners; if they converge on the inner city, raise five beacons and five banners. At night, use fire signals in the same manner. Watchmen must act swiftly in emergencies.\n\nAt dusk, deploy scouts, assigning them minor posts. On hills and in forests, ensure all can be approached, and conduct inspections at dawn. If no approach is possible, each shall mark their position, and the city below shall respond accordingly.\n\nScouts shall place field markers, with lookouts stationed inside and outside the outer city, flags raised, and half the troops concealed within, their numbers unknown. At signs of alarm, raise the *kong* marker; upon sighting the enemy, raise the *mu* marker. On the city walls, signal with banners, and the outposts shall beat drums, align flags, and prepare for battle as directed. Farmers—men shall follow the outposts in battle readiness, while women shall swiftly return indoors. Upon enemy sighting, relay the report to the city’s commander.\n\nEach watch post shall have three guards, taking turns striking the marker while observing. Patrols of cavalry or officials shall inspect the surroundings to discern the enemy’s intentions. Upon sounding the drum, if the enemy is sighted, the drumming shall continue until the signal reaches the city.\n\nFor annual provisions:\n- One *sheng* per meal: thirty-six *shi* per year;\n- One-third *sheng* per meal: twenty-four *shi* per year;\n- One-fourth *sheng* per meal: eighteen *shi* per year;\n- One-fifth *sheng* per meal: fourteen *shi* and one *sheng* per year;\n- One-sixth *sheng* per meal: twelve *shi* per year.\n\nDaily rations per person:\n- One *sheng* per meal: five *sheng* per day;\n- One-third *sheng* per meal: three *sheng* per day;\n- One-fourth *sheng* per meal: two and a half *sheng* per day;\n- One-fifth *sheng* per meal: two *sheng* per day;\n- One-sixth *sheng* per meal: one and two-thirds *sheng* per day, with two meals daily.\n\nIn times of life-saving urgency:\n- Two *sheng* per day for twenty days;\n- Three *sheng* per day for thirty days;\n- Four *sheng* per day for forty days.\nThus, the people shall be spared from ninety days of hardship.\n\nWhen the enemy draws near, collect all miscellaneous metal vessels from the villages—bronze, iron, or anything useful for defense. First inventory all official residences, offices, and non-essential buildings, noting the size, length, and quantity of materials, prioritizing urgent needs. If the enemy presses close, dismantle houses and fell trees, ignoring any pleas or petitions. Bring firewood inside, stacking it not in overlapping rows but in orderly piles for easy retrieval. Any timber that cannot be brought inside shall be burned to deny its use to the enemy.\n\nStack wood by size, length, quality, and shape, with each type stored within the city’s four outer walls. Use the largest timbers as crossbars before piling the rest. For the city’s defense officers and above, their parents, siblings, wives, and children shall be held as hostages in the ruler’s residence to ensure steadfast defense.\n\nAppoint officials as follows:\n- *Du Sikong*: four for large cities, two for lookouts;\n- County lookouts: one per side;\n- *Ting Wei*, *Ci Sikong*, and *Yi Zheng*: one each.\n\nThose serving as attendants in the defense headquarters must be sufficiently wealthy, upright, and trustworthy, with their parents, siblings, wives, and children residing in the fortified palace. All officials must provide hostages to qualify for their duties.\n\nAt each main gate, station two guards, standing on either side to direct passersby outward. Place four halberds beside each gate, with the guards seated beneath them. Officials shall inspect them five times daily, recording the names of those who pass.\n\nWhere moats and waterways have strategic points or vulnerabilities, station suspicious individuals to be targeted by night patrols. In the water outside the walls, install bamboo spikes, each one *chi* wide and two *bu* long, submerged five *cun* below the water’s surface, varying in length. Arrange three rows along the outer edge, with the outermost row facing outward and the inner row facing inward.\n\nEvery thirty *bu*, construct an archery shelter, ten *chi* wide and twelve *chi* deep. In emergencies, dispatch the nearest reinforcements first, with others following in succession. For official passes, the issuer must clearly record the circumstances, ensuring the pass matches the stated purpose, and verify its return with a tally. When a pass is issued, the gatekeeper shall announce the time and the name of the bearer.\n\nForm units of one hundred *bu*. Connect and interlink guard posts, tunneling through walls where necessary. Build elevated walkways and construct embankments, reinforcing their tops. First, deliberate on virtuous plans and strategies before entering the fortified palace. Once inside, do not leave the city or abandon your post.\n\nAll defenders must thoroughly assess the city’s low walls and shallow moats, adjusting their defenses accordingly. Morning and evening, the troops shall sing to maintain discipline, using fewer men for easier defense. Select capable individuals and ensure every household stores three years’ worth of grain and vegetables to prepare for floods, droughts, or poor harvests.\n\nRegularly instruct border counties to cultivate *qiang*, *yun*, *wuhui*, and *zhuye*, planting them in outer residences where ditches and wells are genuine; if blocked, place them within. In times of peace, demonstrate danger; in times of danger, demonstrate peace.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches, have all gates and doors drilled with paired holes, one set connected by a four-*chi*-long rope as thick as a finger.\n\nWhen the enemy arrives, first slaughter oxen, sheep, chickens, dogs, crows, and ravens, preserving their hides, sinews, horns, fat, wings, and feathers. Strip all conches. Have officials collect tung wood to forge iron spikes, and use thick bamboo as crossbars. In urgent situations where troops cannot venture far, order the felling of trees in outer residences. Calculate the required quantity: if preparing to strike from the city’s original empty spaces, arrange them at three corners. For all trees weighing over five *jin*, soak them in water, but no longer than one night. For thatched roofs or stacked firewood, apply a coating at least five *cun* thick. Officials shall each report the resources within their jurisdiction that can be used for defense.\n\nThere are slanderers, opportunists, malevolent people, virtuous people, leaders, strategists, warriors, artisans, messengers, insiders, outsiders, good-natured people, and those skilled at guarding gates—examine the reasons for their reputations and only admit them accordingly. When civilians feud or criticize officials, record the officials’ explanations in writing and store them to await verification upon receiving reports.\n\nThose under five *chi* in height or unfit for sudden labor shall be assigned as clerks to serve in government offices or residences. Carefully organize and stockpile *lan* stones, sharpened arrows, and all wooden implements, each with designated quantities. Construct transport carts with carrying frames, and for city gates, use locking carts with axles ten *chi* wide, shafts one *zhang* long, and three spokes six *chi* in width. Build wooden boxes as long as the shafts and four *chi* high, ensuring the lids are well-sealed and the interiors can hold arrows.\n\nMaster Mozi said: There are five conditions under which a city cannot be defended: first, when the city is large but the population is small; second, when the city is small but the population is large; third, when the population is large but food supplies are scarce; fourth, when markets are far from the city; fifth, when supplies are stored outside and the wealthy reside elsewhere. A city of ten thousand households should measure three *li* on each side.\n\n*End of Scroll Fifteen of Mozi*\n\n#47 See note #43. #48 See note #25. #49 The character *shǎo* (\"few\") in *Xián Gǔ* is written as *bàn* (\"half\"), which is correct. #50 In *Xián Gǔ*, the two characters *zhī kě* (\"know possible\") are inverted. #51 Wang Niansun, based on the following text, adds the two characters *jiàn kòu* (\"see the enemy\") after *wàng* (\"observe\"). #52 Wang Niansun adds the character *guō* (\"outer wall\") after *rù* (\"enter\"). #53 Wang Niansun, based on the following text, adds the character *lìng* (\"command\") after *wú* (\"none\"). #54 Wang Niansun states: *méi* (\"peg\") should be *cái* (\"material\"). #55 Wang Yinzhi states: *fá* (\"attack\") should be *dài* (\"replace\"). #56 In *Xián Gǔ*, *zhèng* (\"correct\") is written as *zhǐ* (\"stop\"). #57 Bi Yuan emends *yún* (\"say\") to *qù* (\"remove\") based on context. #58 Bi Yuan, based on the following text, adds the character *zú* (\"soldiers\") before *nǎi* (\"then\"). #59 Wang Niansun emends the two characters *shǎng shěn* (\"reward carefully\") to *shěn shǎng* (\"careful reward\") based on the *Bèi Tī Piān*. #60 In *Xián Gǔ*, the passage *\"hóu wú guò wǔshí, kòu zhì suí yè qù, wéi shí dài\"* (\"scouts should not exceed fifty; when the enemy arrives, follow the leaves and depart; only eat when catching up\") is moved to follow *\"shǒu fēng zhě shì jí\"* (\"the matter of guarding the beacon is urgent\").

To see the worthy and not act with urgency is to neglect one’s lord. Without the worthy, there is no urgency; without the *shi*, there is no one with whom to deliberate on the state’s affairs. That a state could survive while neglecting the worthy and forgetting the *shi* has never been known.\n\nIn ancient times, Duke Wen fled into exile yet rectified the world; Duke Huan left his state yet commanded the feudal lords; King Goujian of Yue endured the humiliation of King Fuchai of Wu, yet still became one of the worthy rulers of the Central States. These three men achieved fame and success throughout the world precisely because they had suffered humiliation and great disgrace in their own states.\n\nThe highest level is to avoid defeat; the next is to suffer defeat yet still achieve success—this is what it means to employ the people.\n\nI have heard it said: It is not that there is no secure dwelling, but that I have no secure heart. It is not that there is no sufficient wealth, but that I have no contented heart. Thus, the noble person makes things difficult for himself and easy for others, while the common people make things easy for themselves and difficult for others.\n\nThe noble person advances without compromising his resolve; he examines his true feelings within. Though mingled with the mediocre, he harbors no resentment, for he has confidence in himself. Therefore, one who does what is difficult will surely attain what he desires; I have never heard of one who pursues only what he desires and yet avoids what he detests.\n\nThus, flattering ministers harm their lord, and sycophantic subordinates harm their superiors. A lord must have ministers who refuse to yield; a superior must have subordinates who speak bluntly. Those who engage in endless debate and those who merely quarrel—how can they ensure long life and preserve the state?\n\nIf ministers value their ranks and titles yet remain silent, those near at hand will be benighted, and those far away will be estranged. Resentment will take root in the hearts of the people, flattery and obsequiousness will surround the ruler, and good counsel will be blocked—then the state is in peril.\n\nDid Jie and Zhou lack men of the world? They brought ruin upon themselves and lost the world. Therefore, it is said: To return a state’s treasures is not as good as presenting the worthy and advancing the *shi*.\n\nNow, if there are five awls, the sharpest will be the first to break. If there are five knives, the most finely whetted will be the first to wear down. Thus, sweet wells are the first to run dry; tall trees are the first to be felled; sacred tortoises are the first to be scorched; divine serpents are the first to be exposed.\n\nTherefore, the choking of Bi Gan was due to his uprightness; the killing of Meng Ben was due to his courage; the drowning of Xi Shi was due to her beauty; the dismemberment of Wu Qi was due to his deeds. Thus, those who excel in any way rarely escape death because of their strengths. Hence, it is said: Excess is difficult to sustain.\n\nTherefore, even a worthy lord does not cherish ministers without merit; even a loving father does not cherish a son who brings no benefit. Thus, one who cannot bear the responsibilities of his position does not deserve that position; one who cannot bear the duties of his rank does not deserve that emolument.\n\nA fine bow is difficult to draw, yet it can reach high and penetrate deep. A fine horse is difficult to ride, yet it can bear heavy burdens and travel far. A fine talent is difficult to command, yet it can bring honor to its lord and win respect.\n\nThus, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers do not reject the small streams that fill them, and so they become great. The sage, in his affairs, does not refuse; in his dealings with things, he does not oppose. Thus, he becomes a vessel for the world.\n\nTherefore, the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers do not come from a single source; a robe of a thousand *yi* is not made from the white fur of a single fox.",

      "translated_text": "How can there be a case where one adopts the same method yet fails to achieve the same result? This is not the Way of the Universal King. Thus, Heaven and Earth do not shine with dazzling brilliance; great waters do not surge with mere torrents; great fires do not blaze with flickering flames; and the king’s virtue is not confined to Yao-like radiance. Only then can one become the leader of a thousand men. Straight as an arrow, level as a whetstone—this alone is insufficient to encompass all things. Therefore, narrow streams dry swiftly; shallow currents exhaust quickly; scorched lands yield no harvest. If these three—deep virtue, unobstructed flow, and fertile soil—do not extend beyond the palace, they cannot nourish the state.\n\n**Cultivating the Self (Second Chapter)**\nThough the gentleman engages in battle with formations, courage is his foundation; though mourning follows ritual, grief is its essence; though the scholar pursues learning, conduct is its root. Thus, if the root is not firmly planted, do not strive to flourish the branches. If those near are not won over, do not seek to attract those afar. If kin do not draw close, do not pursue external alliances. If affairs lack beginning and end, do not multiply undertakings. If a matter is not thoroughly examined, do not spread its fame.\n\nTherefore, the former kings in governing the world first scrutinized the near to reach the far. The gentleman examines the near and cultivates it. Seeing misconduct, facing slander, he reflects upon himself. Thus, resentment diminishes and conduct improves.\n\nMalicious words should not enter the ears; harsh sounds should not leave the mouth; the impulse to harm others’ children should not dwell in the heart. Even if there are slanderous people, they will have no foothold. Thus, the gentleman’s strength in affairs grows daily, his aspirations deepen, and his vigor flourishes.\n\nThe Way of the gentleman: in poverty, he manifests integrity; in wealth, he manifests righteousness; in life, he manifests love; in death, he manifests grief. These four virtues cannot be feigned—they must be embodied. What is stored in the heart must not exhaust love; what moves the body must not exhaust reverence; what issues from the mouth must not exhaust gentleness. Flowing through the four limbs, penetrating the skin and flesh, even as hair whitens and the temples turn purple, he does not abandon them—such is the sage alone.\n\nOne whose will is not strong will not attain wisdom. One whose words are not trustworthy will not achieve resolute action. One who clings to wealth and cannot share with others is unworthy of friendship. One who does not steadfastly uphold the Way, whose knowledge is narrow, whose judgment of right and wrong is unclear—such a person is unfit for companionship.\n\nIf the root is not firm, the branches will surely wither. One who is bold but does not cultivate himself will later grow indolent. If the source is turbid, the flow will not run clear. One whose conduct lacks sincerity will see his reputation dissipate. Fame does not arise spontaneously, nor does praise grow of itself. Only when merit is achieved and reputation established can fame and praise not be feigned—they must be embodied.\n\nOne who speaks much but acts slowly, though eloquent, will not be heeded. One who boasts of his strength and claims credit for achievements, though laborious, will not be rewarded. The wise discern with the heart but do not speak excessively; they are strong but do not boast of their merits. Thus, their fame and praise spread throughout the world.\n\nDo not strive for quantity in speech but for wisdom; do not strive for ornamentation but for discernment. For one who possesses wisdom but lacks discernment in himself, his emotions will lead him astray.\n\nGoodness that does not reside in the heart will not endure; conduct that is not distinguished in oneself will not stand. Fame cannot be achieved through simplicity, nor can praise be established through cunning. The gentleman carries his conduct upon his person. One who seeks profit while neglecting reputation, who forgets fame in pursuit of gain—such a person has never been fit to serve as a scholar in the world.\n\n**The Influence of Association (Third Chapter)**\nMaster Mozi said: Seeing one who dyes silk, he sighed and said, “Dyed in indigo, it becomes indigo; dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow. What enters changes, and its color changes with it. After five immersions, it will have five colors. Thus, dyeing cannot be taken lightly.”\n\nIt is not only silk that is so—states, too, have their influences. Shun was influenced by Xu You and Bo Yang; Yu by Gao Yao and Bo Yi; Tang by Yi Yin and Zhong Hui; King Wu by the Grand Duke and the Duke of Zhou. These four kings were rightly influenced, and so they ruled the world, became Son of Heaven, and their merit and fame covered Heaven and Earth. When the world’s benevolent and righteous are mentioned, these four kings must be named.\n\nJie of Xia was influenced by Gan Xin and Tui Dong; Zhou of Yin by Chong Hou and E Lai; King Li by Li Gong Changfu and Rong Yi Zhong; King You by Fu Gong Yi and Cai Gong Gu. These four kings were wrongly influenced, and so their states were ruined, their persons perished, and they became a disgrace to the world. When the world’s unjust and shameful are mentioned, these four kings must be named.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi was influenced by Guan Zhong and Bao Shu; Duke Wen of Jin by Jiu Fan and Gao Yan; King Zhuang of Chu by Sun Shu and Shen Yin; King Helü of Wu by Wu Zixu and Wen Yi; King Goujian of Yue by Fan Li and the Grand Minister Zhong. These five lords were rightly influenced, and so they became hegemons over the feudal lords, and their merit and fame were transmitted to later generations.\n\nFan Jishe was influenced by Chang Liu Shuo and Wang Zhu; Zhonghang Yin by Ji Qin and Gao Qiang; King Fuchai of Wu by Wangsun Xiong and the Grand Steward Pi; Zhibo Yao by Zhi Guo and Zhang Wu; Shang of Zhongshan by Wei Yi and Yan Chang; Kang of Song by Tang Yang and Xian Buli. These six lords were wrongly influenced, and so their states were ruined, their persons executed, their ancestral temples destroyed, their lineages extinguished, their ministers scattered, and their people fled. When the world’s greedy, violent, and oppressive rulers are mentioned, these six lords must be named.\n\nWhat is it that makes a ruler secure? It is his adherence to principle, and his adherence to principle lies in right influence. Thus, the good ruler labors in selecting men and is at ease in governing his officials. The incapable ruler harms his body and exhausts his spirit, worries his heart and wearies his mind, yet his state grows ever more perilous, and his person ever more disgraced. These six lords did not fail to value their states or love their persons—they simply did not know the essentials.",

      "translated_text": "Those who do not know the essentials are those whose influences are misaligned. Not only states have influences—scholars, too, have influences. If one’s friends all cherish benevolence and righteousness, are sincere, cautious, and respectful of the law, then one’s household prospers day by day, one’s person grows ever more secure, one’s name ever more honored, and in office one attains the proper order—such were the likes of Duangan Mu, Qinzi, and Fu Yue. If one’s friends all delight in arrogance and aggression, in scheming and factionalism, then one’s household declines day by day, one’s person grows ever more imperiled, one’s name ever more disgraced, and in office one loses the proper order—such were the likes of Zixi, Yi Ya, and Jian Diao. The *Odes* says: “One must choose what one embraces; one must be vigilant in what one embraces.” This is what it means.\n\n**Modeling the Standard, IV**\nMaster Mozi said: Those who engage in affairs under Heaven cannot be without a standard. There are none whose affairs succeed without a standard. Even the most eminent scholars who become generals or ministers all have standards, and even the humblest artisans who ply their trades all have standards. Artisans square things with the carpenter’s square, circle them with the compass, align them with the plumb line, and level them with the hanging weight. Whether skilled or unskilled, all take these five as their standard. The skilled can meet the mark, while the unskilled, though they may not meet it, still follow it in their work and thus surpass their own efforts. Therefore, all artisans have a standard by which they measure. Now, those who govern all under Heaven or rule great states yet lack a standard by which to measure—this is not as discerning as the artisans.\n\nWhat, then, should be taken as the standard for governance? Should all model themselves after their parents? There are many parents under Heaven, but the benevolent are few. If all modeled themselves after their parents, this would be modeling after what is not benevolent. To model after what is not benevolent cannot serve as a standard. Should all model themselves after their teachers? There are many scholars under Heaven, but the benevolent are few. If all modeled themselves after their teachers, this would be modeling after what is not benevolent. To model after what is not benevolent cannot serve as a standard. Should all model themselves after their rulers? There are many rulers under Heaven, but the benevolent are few. If all modeled themselves after their rulers, this would be modeling after what is not benevolent. To model after what is not benevolent cannot serve as a standard. Thus, parents, teachers, and rulers—none of these three can serve as a viable standard for governance.\n\nWhat, then, should be taken as the standard for governance? Therefore, it is said: Nothing is better than modeling after Heaven. Heaven’s conduct is vast and impartial, its bestowals generous yet without claim of virtue, its illumination enduring and unwaning. Thus, the sage-kings modeled themselves after it. Having taken Heaven as their standard, in all actions and undertakings, they measured themselves against Heaven. What Heaven desired, they did; what Heaven did not desire, they ceased. Yet what does Heaven desire, and what does it abhor? Heaven surely desires that people love and benefit one another, and does not desire that they hate and harm one another.\n\nHow do we know that Heaven desires people to love and benefit one another, and does not desire them to hate and harm one another? Because it universally loves and universally benefits them. How do we know that Heaven universally loves and universally benefits them? Because it universally possesses and universally nourishes them. Now, under Heaven, no state is too small or too great—all are Heaven’s domains. No person is too young or too old, too noble or too base—all are Heaven’s subjects. Thus, none fail to raise sheep, rear dogs and swine, prepare fine millet wine and sweet liquor, and offer rich sacrifices to reverently serve Heaven. Is this not universally possessing and universally nourishing them? If Heaven indeed universally possesses and nourishes them, how could it not desire that people love and benefit one another?\n\nTherefore, those who love and benefit others will surely receive Heaven’s blessings, while those who hate and harm others will surely incur Heaven’s calamities. Those who kill the innocent will meet with misfortune. How could it be that when people harm one another, Heaven would grant them blessings? Thus, Heaven desires that people love and benefit one another, and does not desire that they hate and harm one another.\n\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu universally cared for the hundred clans under Heaven, leading them to revere Heaven and serve the spirits. Their benefiting of others was great, so Heaven blessed them, establishing them as Sons of Heaven, and all the feudal lords under Heaven paid them homage. The violent kings Jie, Zhou, You, and Li universally harmed the hundred clans under Heaven, leading them to revile Heaven and insult the spirits. Their harming of others was great, so Heaven brought them calamity, causing them to lose their states, die in disgrace under Heaven, and be vilified by later generations and their descendants—even now, the condemnation does not cease.\n\nThus, those who do evil and incur calamity were like Jie, Zhou, You, and Li; those who love and benefit others and receive blessings were like Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. There have been those who loved and benefited others and received blessings, and likewise, there have been those who hated and harmed others and incurred calamities.\n\n**Seven Calamities, V**\nMaster Mozi said: A state has seven calamities. What are the seven calamities?\n1. When the city walls, moats, and pools cannot be defended, yet palaces and halls are constructed—this is the first calamity.\n2. When enemy states reach the borders, yet none of the four neighbors come to the rescue—this is the second calamity.\n3. When the people’s strength is exhausted on useless works, and rewards are bestowed upon the incapable, so that the people’s strength is spent on what is useless and treasures are depleted on entertaining guests—this is the third calamity.\n4. When officials serve for emoluments, wanderers worry about returning, the ruler enforces laws and punishes his ministers, and the ministers are cowed and dare not oppose him—this is the fourth calamity.\n5. When the ruler considers himself sagely and wise and does not consult on affairs, deems himself secure and strong and has no defenses, and when the four neighbors plot against him, he remains unaware and unprepared—this is the fifth calamity.\n6. When those he speaks to are not loyal, and those he trusts are not faithful—this is the sixth calamity.\n7. When grain and legumes are insufficient to feed the people, great ministers are insufficient to serve the state, rewards cannot please, and punishments cannot awe—this is the seventh calamity.\n\nTo govern a state with these seven calamities will surely lose the altars of soil and grain; to defend a city with these seven calamities, when the enemy arrives, the state will collapse. Where the seven calamities prevail, the state will surely suffer disaster.",
      "overlap_context": "is it that makes a ruler secure? It is his adherence to principle, and his adherence to principle lies in right influence. Thus, the good ruler labors in selecting men and is at ease in governing his officials.

      "translated_text": "All grains are what the people depend upon, and what the ruler relies on for sustenance. Thus, if the people have nothing to depend on, the ruler has no sustenance; if the people have no food, they cannot be employed. Therefore, the production of food cannot be neglected, the land cannot be left untended, and expenditures cannot be left unchecked. When all five grains are fully harvested, the ruler enjoys all five flavors; if not fully harvested, he does not enjoy them all. If one grain fails, it is called scarcity; if two fail, drought; if three fail, disaster; if four fail, dearth; if all five fail, famine. In a year of scarcity, officials from grand masters downward have their salaries reduced by one-fifth; in a drought, by two-fifths; in a disaster, by three-fifths; in a dearth, by four-fifths; in a famine, salaries are entirely suspended, and only rations are provided. Thus, when disaster and famine afflict the state, the ruler removes five-fifths of his bronze cauldrons for food, grand masters remove their suspended bells, scholars do not attend school, the ruler’s court robes remain unaltered, envoys from the feudal lords and neighboring states are served plain meals without delicacies, glue and leather are removed, roads go unweeded, horses are not fed grain, and concubines do not wear silk—this is the utmost sign of insufficiency.\n\nNow, if a man carrying his child draws water and drops the child into a well, the mother will surely follow to rescue it. Yet when the year is disastrous and the people starve by the roadside, some even abandon their own children—this suffering is worse than the child falling into the well. How can it go unexamined? Thus, in good years, the people are kind and virtuous; in bad years, they are stingy and wicked. What constant nature do the people possess? When those who produce are few and those who consume are many, the year cannot be abundant. Therefore, it is said: when wealth is insufficient, return to the seasons; when food is insufficient, return to frugality. Thus, the ancients generated wealth in accordance with the seasons, secured the fundamentals, and used resources sparingly—then wealth was sufficient. Even the sage-kings of antiquity could not ensure that the five grains always ripened and that droughts and floods never came. Yet why were there no people freezing or starving? Because they exerted themselves in timely labor and practiced self-restraint in sustenance. Thus, the *Book of Xia* states: \"Yu endured seven years of floods.\" The *Book of Yin* states: \"Tang endured five years of drought.\" These were severe calamities indeed. Yet why did the people not freeze or starve? Because they generated wealth diligently and used it frugally.\n\nTherefore, without stored grain, one cannot withstand famine; without stored weapons, even with righteousness, one cannot punish the unrighteous; without complete city walls, one cannot defend oneself; without prepared plans, one cannot respond to emergencies. It is like Qing Ji, who, without the resolve to flee, could not lightly venture out. Jie lacked preparations against Tang, so he was exiled; Zhou lacked preparations against King Wu, so he was killed. Though Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, they were both destroyed by rulers of a hundred *li*—why? Because they were wealthy and noble yet made no preparations. Thus, preparedness is the state’s weightiest concern. Food is the state’s treasure; weapons are the state’s claws; walls are its means of defense. These three are the state’s essentials. Therefore, it is said: to exhaust the treasury with lavish rewards for the undeserving, to deplete the storehouses for carriages, horses, fine robes, and curiosities, to exhaust the laborers with the construction of palaces and towers for pleasure, and to prepare extravagant coffins and multiple layers of burial garments—while alive, building terraces and pavilions, and in death, constructing grand tombs—this causes the people to suffer externally while the treasury is depleted internally, the ruler never sated with pleasure, and the people unable to bear their hardship. Thus, when the state faces enemies, it is harmed; when the people encounter famine, they perish—all due to the failure to maintain preparedness.\n\nMoreover, food is what the sage treasures. Thus, the *Book of Zhou* states: \"A state without three years’ worth of food is no true state; a household without three years’ worth of food has no true heir.\" This is called state preparedness.\n\n**Chapter on Excessive Expenditure, Part Six**\nMozi said: In ancient times, when the people did not yet know how to build palaces, they dwelled on hills and mounds, living in caves. The dampness below harmed them, so the sage-kings constructed palaces. The standards for palace construction were: height sufficient to avoid dampness, walls sufficient to block wind and cold, roofs sufficient to withstand snow, frost, rain, and dew, and palace walls high enough to distinguish the rites between men and women. Beyond this, no additional expenditures of wealth or labor were made without benefit. Thus, the sage-kings built palaces for the convenience of living, not for ostentation or pleasure. They made clothing, belts, and shoes for bodily comfort, not for extravagance. By moderating their own conduct and instructing the people, the people of the world could be governed, and resources could be made sufficient.\n\nToday’s rulers, however, build palaces differently. They heavily levy taxes on the people, violently seize their clothing and food, constructing palaces, terraces, and pavilions with winding views, adorned with blue and yellow carvings—such extravagance causes their attendants to imitate them. Thus, their wealth is insufficient to withstand famine or relieve orphans and widows, leaving the state impoverished and the people difficult to govern. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in palace construction.\n\nIn ancient times, before the people knew how to make clothing, they wore animal skins and bound themselves with straw. In winter, these were not light yet warm; in summer, not light yet cool. The sage-kings deemed this inadequate for human needs, so they instructed women to weave and labor, repairing city walls—thus, the people toiled without harm. By maintaining regular governance and collecting taxes, the people spent without suffering. What truly afflicted the people was not this.",

      "translated_text": "The people suffered from heavy levies of silk and hemp, bundled cloth and silk, all to make garments for them. The method for making clothing was this: in winter, layered silk was sufficient to be both light and warm. This was all that was needed. Thus, the sages made clothing to fit the body, harmonize with the skin, and suffice—it was not to dazzle the eyes or impress the foolish. At that time, sturdy chariots and fine horses were not prized, nor were carvings and embroidery admired. Why? Because the Dao guided them thus. Therefore, when the people’s resources for clothing and food were such that each household could withstand drought, flood, or famine, why was this so? They understood the essence of self-sustenance and were not deluded by external things. Thus, the people were frugal and easy to govern, and their ruler spent sparingly and was easily supplied. Storehouses were full, sufficient to meet unforeseen needs; armor and weapons were not worn out, and soldiers and commoners were not overburdened, enough to subdue the disobedient. Thus, the enterprise of hegemons and kings could be realized throughout the world.\n\nToday’s rulers, however, make clothing differently. In winter, they wear light, warm garments; in summer, light, cool ones—all these are already provided. Yet they still heavily levy the people, violently seizing the resources for their clothing and food to make brocade, embroidery, and extravagant robes. They cast gold into hooks and use pearls and jade as ornaments; women labor over embroidery, and men carve and engrave, all to adorn themselves. This does not enhance warmth but merely exhausts wealth and labor, squandering them on useless things. From this, it is clear that their clothing is not for the body but for ostentation. Thus, the people become licentious and difficult to govern, and their rulers grow extravagant and hard to admonish. With such extravagant rulers governing such licentious people, to hope for no disorder is impossible. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in clothing.\n\nIn ancient times, before the people knew how to prepare food, they ate raw and lived apart. Thus, the sages taught men to plow, sow, and cultivate, providing food for the people. Their food was only to increase qi, fill hunger, strengthen the body, and satisfy the stomach—nothing more. Thus, they spent sparingly, lived frugally, and the people were wealthy while the state was well-ordered.\n\nToday, it is not so. Heavy levies are imposed on the people to prepare fine foods—fattened livestock, roasted and grilled fish and turtles. Great states pile up a hundred vessels; small states, ten. The spread stretches a square *zhang*, the eye cannot take it all in, the hand cannot grasp it all, the mouth cannot taste it all. In winter, the food freezes; in summer, it spoils. When rulers feast like this, their attendants imitate them. Thus, the wealthy grow extravagant, while orphans and widows freeze and starve. To hope for no disorder is impossible. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in food and drink.\n\nIn ancient times, before the people knew how to make boats and carts, heavy burdens could not be moved, and distant roads could not be reached. Thus, the sage-kings created boats and carts to facilitate the people’s affairs. Their boats and carts were sturdy, light, and efficient, capable of bearing heavy loads and traveling far. They required little expenditure but brought great benefit, so the people delighted in and profited from them. Thus, laws and orders were carried out without urgency, and the people were not overburdened yet had enough. Therefore, the people turned to them.\n\nToday’s rulers make boats and carts differently. Though sturdy, light, and efficient vessels are already provided, they still heavily levy the people to adorn them—embellishing carts with embroidery and boats with carvings. Women abandon their weaving to work on embroidery, so the people grow cold; men leave their plowing and sowing to carve and engrave, so the people go hungry. When rulers make boats and carts like this, their attendants imitate them. Thus, the people suffer both hunger and cold, leading to wickedness and banditry. The more this happens, the harsher the punishments; the harsher the punishments, the more the state falls into chaos. If a ruler truly desires the world to be well-ordered and hates disorder, he must practice moderation in boats and carts.\n\nAll things between heaven and earth, within the four seas, the nature of heaven and earth, the harmony of yin and yang—none are not as they are. Even the greatest sages cannot alter them. How do we know this is so? The sages have transmitted: for heaven and earth, there are above and below; for the four seasons, there are yin and yang; for human nature, there are men and women; for birds and beasts, there are male and female. This is the true nature of heaven and earth, which even the former kings could not change.\n\nThough the sages of antiquity surely kept concubines, they did not let this harm their conduct. Thus, the people bore no resentment. There were no sequestered women in the palace, so there were no widowers in the world. With no sequestered women within and no widowers without, the people of the world multiplied.\n\nToday’s rulers, however, keep concubines—great states hold thousands, small states hundreds. Thus, in the world, many men are widowed without wives, and many women are sequestered without husbands. Men miss their time, so the people grow few. If a ruler truly desires a large population and hates scarcity, he must practice moderation in keeping concubines.\n\nThese five matters are what the sages practiced frugality and moderation in, and what petty men indulge in to excess. With frugality and moderation, there is prosperity; with excess and indulgence, there is ruin. These five cannot be left unmoderated. When husband and wife are moderate, heaven and earth are in harmony; when wind and rain are timely, the five grains ripen; when clothing is moderate, the skin and flesh are at ease.\n\n**Section Three, Chapter Seven**\nCheng Fan asked Mozi: \"The sage-kings did not make music.\"",

Now you say the sage-kings did not make music—this is like driving a horse without unharnessing it, or drawing a bow without releasing it. Is this not something those with blood and qi cannot endure?\n\nMozi replied: In former times, Yao and Shun had *Di Qi*, which served as both ritual and music. Tang exiled Jie to the great waters, encircled the world, and established himself as king. With his affairs accomplished and no great future troubles, he created music and named it *Nine Summons*. King Wu vanquished Yin and killed Zhou, encircled the world, and established himself as king. With his affairs accomplished and no great future troubles, he followed the music of the former kings and also created his own, naming it *Elephant*. King Cheng of Zhou followed the music of the former sages and named it *Zhou Yu*. Yet King Cheng’s governance of the world was not equal to King Wu’s; King Wu’s governance was not equal to Tang’s; and Tang’s governance was not equal to Yao and Shun’s.

      "translated_text": "Master Mozi declared: In antiquity, lords and grandees who governed states all desired their nations to prosper, their people to multiply, and their penal administration to be well-ordered. Yet instead of prosperity, they met with poverty; instead of abundance, they met with scarcity; instead of order, they met with chaos. Thus, they lost what they desired and gained what they abhorred—what was the reason for this?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: It lies in the fact that lords and grandees governing states could not employ the principle of exalting worthiness and employing ability in their administration. For when a state possesses many men of worth and excellence, its governance is substantial; when such men are few, its governance is meager. Therefore, the paramount task of rulers is to multiply the worthy.\n\nIt may be asked: How then shall the multiplication of the worthy be safeguarded?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: Consider the case of one who desires to increase the number of skilled archers and charioteers in the state: he must enrich them, ennoble them, revere them, and praise them—only then can the state’s skilled archers and charioteers be multiplied. How much more so for men of worth and excellence, whose virtue and conduct are profound, whose speech and discourse are discerning, and whose mastery of the Dao and its safeguards is expansive? These are indeed the state’s treasures and the altars’ pillars. They too must be enriched, ennobled, revered, and praised—only then can the state’s good men be multiplied.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of old governed with this decree: \"What is unrighteous shall not be enriched; what is unrighteous shall not be ennobled; what is unrighteous shall not be befriended; what is unrighteous shall not be drawn near.\" When the state’s wealthy and noble heard this, they withdrew and deliberated, saying: \"Formerly, what we relied upon was our wealth and nobility. Now the ruler exalts righteousness without shunning poverty and lowliness—thus we cannot but act righteously.\" When those close to the ruler heard this, they too withdrew and deliberated, saying: \"Formerly, what we relied upon was our closeness. Now the ruler exalts righteousness without shunning distance—thus we cannot but act righteously.\" When those far from the ruler heard this, they too withdrew and deliberated, saying: \"Formerly, I thought remoteness left me without reliance. Now the ruler exalts righteousness without shunning remoteness—thus I cannot but act righteously.\" Even the ministers of distant borderlands, the attendants of the palace courtyards, the masses within the state, and the common folk of the four frontiers—all who heard this vied to act righteously.\n\nWhat was the reason for this? It is that what the ruler uses to command his subordinates is one thing, and what the subordinates use to serve their ruler is one safeguard. To illustrate with a parable: there is a high wall and a deep palace. The wall is erected with care, and a single gate is hewn at the top. If a thief enters, the gate is sealed behind him, and he is sought within—then the thief has no way to escape. What is the reason for this? The ruler has grasped the essential point.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, in ancient times, the sage-kings governed by ranking virtue and esteeming worthiness. Even among farmers, artisans, and merchants, if one possessed ability, they would elevate him, grant him high rank, bestow upon him generous emolument, entrust him with affairs, and empower him to issue decrees. They declared: \"If rank is not exalted, the people will not revere it; if emolument is not ample, the people will not trust it; if decrees are not decisive, the people will not fear them.\" Conferring these three upon the enlightened was not to reward worthiness for its own sake, but to ensure the success of their undertakings.\n\nAt such times, one advanced in rank by virtue, served in office by duty, and was rewarded according to labor, with emolument apportioned by merit. Thus, no office was perpetually noble, nor were the people eternally base; those with ability were elevated, while those without were demoted. Public righteousness was upheld, and private resentments were set aside—this is what such words meant.\n\nThus, in ancient times, Yao elevated Shun from the southern banks of Fuze Marsh, entrusted him with governance, and the world was at peace. Yu elevated Yi from the midst of Yinfang, entrusted him with governance, and the Nine Provinces were completed. Tang elevated Yi Yin from the kitchen, entrusted him with governance, and his plans succeeded. King Wen elevated Hong Yao and Tai Dian from among the hunters, entrusted them with governance, and the western lands submitted. At such times, even those ministers in positions of generous emolument and exalted rank dared not act without reverence and caution, while even farmers, artisans, and merchants vied to encourage one another and esteem the intent.\n\nThus, the scholar-officials served as assistants and heirs to the succession. Therefore, when worthy men were obtained, plans were not thwarted, the ruler’s person was not wearied, reputation was established, meritorious deeds were made manifest, and evil did not arise—all because worthy men were obtained.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: \"In prosperity, worthy men cannot but be elevated; in adversity, worthy men cannot but be elevated.\" If one desires to follow the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, and the former kings, one cannot but esteem worthiness. For esteeming worthiness is the foundation of governance.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Esteeming Worthiness**\nMaster Mozi said: Now, the kings, dukes, and great men who rule the people, preside over the altars of soil and grain, and govern the state—if they wish to preserve and not lose their position, yet do not examine esteeming worthiness as the foundation of governance, how can this be known? It is said: When the noble and wise govern the foolish and base, there is order; when the foolish and base govern the noble and wise, there is chaos. Thus, it is known that esteeming worthiness is the foundation of governance.\n\nTherefore, the ancient sage-kings greatly honored and esteemed worthiness, employing the capable without partiality to fathers or elder brothers, without bias toward the noble or wealthy, and without favoritism for beauty. The worthy were elevated and placed above, enriched and ennobled, made officials and leaders. The unworthy were suppressed and dismissed, impoverished and debased, made subordinates and laborers. Thus, the people all encouraged one another with rewards, feared punishments, and followed one another in becoming worthy. With the worthy numerous and the unworthy few, this was called advancing worthiness.\n\nThen the sage listened to their words, observed their conduct, examined their abilities, and cautiously appointed them to office—this was called employing ability. Thus, those capable of governing the state were made to govern the state; those capable of leading offices were made to lead offices; those capable of governing towns were made to govern towns. All those employed to govern the state, offices, and towns were the state’s worthy men.\n\nWhen worthy men governed the state, they rose early and retired late, hearing lawsuits and administering governance—thus the state was well-ordered and penal laws were just. When worthy men led offices, they slept late and rose early, collecting the profits of passes, markets, mountains, forests, marshes, and weirs to fill the coffers—thus offices were well-supplied and wealth was not dissipated. When worthy men governed towns, they went out early and returned late, tilling the fields, planting crops, and gathering grain—thus grain was abundant and the people had enough to eat.\n\nTherefore, when the state was well-ordered, penal laws were just; when offices were well-supplied, the myriad people were enriched. Above, there was silk and wine for offering to Heaven and the spirits; externally, there were furs and silk for exchanging with the neighboring feudal lords. Internally, there was food to relieve hunger and rest the weary, nourishing the myriad people; externally, there was means to attract the worthy men of the world.\n\nThus, above, Heaven and the spirits enriched them; externally, the feudal lords allied with them; internally, the myriad people were close to them, and worthy men flocked to them. With this, planning affairs succeeded, undertaking tasks was accomplished, defending within was secure, and punishing without was strong. Therefore, it was only the former Three Dynasties’ sage-kings—Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—who thus reigned over the world and rectified the feudal lords, for this was their method.\n\nYet though it is said to follow this method, if one does not know the means to implement it, affairs will remain as if unaccomplished. Therefore, three fundamentals must be established. What are the three fundamentals? It is said: If rank is not exalted, the people will not revere it; if emolument is not ample, the people will not trust it; if decrees are not decisive, the people will not fear them.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings granted high rank, generous emolument, entrusted affairs, and empowered decrees. Was this to bestow gifts upon their ministers? No—it was to ensure the success of their undertakings.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says:\n*\"I tell you of cares and concerns,\nI teach you of the fragrant wine;\nWho can grasp heat\nWithout using cool water?\"*\nThis speaks of how the ancient rulers and feudal lords could not but hold fast to good heirs and assistants—it is like grasping heat without cool water to rinse the hands.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings, if they obtained worthy men, employed them, ennobled them with ranks, enfeoffed them with lands, and were never sated. The worthy men, if they obtained enlightened rulers, exhausted the strength of their four limbs to serve the ruler’s affairs and never wearied. If there was goodness and excellence, they attributed it to their superior. Thus, goodness and excellence resided above, while resentments and slander remained below; joy and delight were with the ruler, while sorrows and anxieties were with the ministers. Thus, the ancient sage-kings governed in this manner.\n\nNow, the kings, dukes, and great men also wish to emulate others in esteeming worthiness and employing ability to govern, granting high rank—but emolument does not follow.",

Thus, the ancient kings declared: \"Those who feed on governance cannot share tasks with others; those who hoard wealth cannot share emolument with others.\" If tasks are not shared and emolument is not distributed, then how can the worthy of the world ever come to stand beside kings, dukes, and great men? If the worthy do not come to their side, then the unworthy will remain at their left and right. With the unworthy at their side, their praises will not rightly honor the worthy, and their punishments will not rightly chastise the violent. If kings, dukes, and great men govern their states and families by such means, then their rewards will not rightly honor the worthy, and their punishments will not rightly chastise the violent. If rewards do not rightly honor the worthy and punishments do not rightly chastise the violent, then the worthy will not be encouraged, and the violent will not be deterred. As a result, at home they will not be filial to their parents; abroad they will not respect their elders in the village. Their conduct will lack restraint, their comings and goings will lack measure, and men and women will lack distinction.

      "translated_text": "Now, when the lords and grandees cannot even make a single robe, they must rely on skilled artisans. When they cannot slaughter a single ox or sheep, they must rely on skilled butchers. Yet when it comes to these two matters, the lords and grandees do not yet know to employ the worthy and capable in governance. Only when their states fall into chaos and their altars face peril do they fail to employ the capable to bring order. Instead, they employ their relatives, or those who have suddenly grown rich and noble, or whose appearance is pleasing. But those who have suddenly grown rich and noble, or whose appearance is pleasing—are they necessarily wise and intelligent? If such are tasked with governing the state, then the state is entrusted to the unwise and unintelligent, and its descent into chaos is already foreseeable.\n\nMoreover, when the lords and grandees favor someone for their appearance and employ them without examining their wisdom, granting office out of affection, they place those who cannot govern a hundred in charge of a thousand, and those who cannot govern a thousand in charge of ten thousand. Why is this? It is said: those who hold office enjoy high rank and generous emoluments, so they are employed out of favoritism. Yet if one who cannot govern a thousand is placed in charge of ten thousand, the office is ten times greater. The principles of governance require daily attention; if the task grows tenfold but the effort does not, if the wisdom does not increase tenfold but the office does, then one part is governed while nine are abandoned. Even if one works day and night to manage such an office, it will remain ungoverned. Why is this? Because the lords and grandees do not understand that employing the worthy and capable is the foundation of governance.\n\nThus, those who govern by employing the worthy and capable achieve order, as I have said; those who govern by employing the inferior bring chaos, as I have also said. Now, if the lords and grandees truly wish to govern their states, to preserve and secure them without loss, why do they not examine the principle of employing the worthy as the foundation of governance?\n\nMoreover, is the principle of employing the worthy as the foundation of governance solely the teaching of Mozi? It is the Way of the sage-kings, the words of the former kings recorded in the *Ju Nian*, which states: \"Seek sagely rulers and wise men to assist and support you.\" The *Yang Shi* says: \"Diligently seek the most sagely, unite with them in strength and purpose to govern the world.\" These words show that sagacity is not lost when the worthy and capable are employed in governance.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of old were able to carefully employ the worthy and capable in governance, without admixture of other considerations, so that all under heaven found their proper place. In ancient times, Shun tilled the fields at Li Mountain, made pottery by the He River, and fished at Lei Marsh. Yao discovered him in the marshes of Fuze, raised him to the position of Son of Heaven, and entrusted him with the governance of the world and the rule of its people. Yi Zhi was a private servant to the daughter of the Youxin clan, personally serving as a cook. Tang discovered him and raised him to be his chief minister, entrusting him with the governance of the world and the rule of its people. Fu Yue wore coarse cloth and a hempen belt, laboring as a hired builder at Chuan Rock. Wu Ding discovered him and raised him to be one of the Three Dukes, entrusting him with the governance of the world and the rule of its people. Why did these men begin in lowliness and end in nobility, begin in poverty and end in wealth? Because the lords and grandees understood the principle of employing the worthy and capable in governance. Thus, the people suffered neither hunger without food, cold without clothing, toil without rest, nor chaos without order.\n\nTherefore, the ancient sage-kings carefully employed the worthy and capable in governance, taking the heavens as their model. Though the heavens make no distinction between rich and poor, noble and base, near and far, kin and stranger, they raise up and honor the worthy, while suppressing and dismissing the unworthy. Then who are those who, being rich and noble, were worthy and thus received reward? They are the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties: Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. And what reward did they receive? In governing the world, they universally loved and benefited the people, leading the myriad peoples to honor heaven, serve the spirits, and love and benefit all. Thus, heaven and the spirits rewarded them, establishing them as Sons of Heaven and fathers and mothers to the people. The myriad peoples praised them as sage-kings, and this praise continues to this day. These are the ones who, being rich and noble, were worthy and thus received reward.\n\nThen who are those who, being rich and noble, were violent and thus received punishment? They are the violent kings of the Three Dynasties: Jie, Zhou, You, and Li. How do we know this? In governing the world, they universally hated and despised the people, leading them to revile heaven and insult the spirits, to scorn and oppress the myriad peoples. Thus, heaven and the spirits punished them, causing them to die and be executed, their descendants scattered, their households destroyed, their posterity cut off. The myriad peoples condemned them as violent kings, and this condemnation continues to this day. These are the ones who, being rich and noble, were violent and thus received punishment.\n\nThen who are those who, though kin, were not good and thus received punishment? They are men like Gun, the eldest son of the Emperor, who was set aside for his lack of virtue and ultimately executed at the wilds of Yu. Even the scorching sun could not reach him, and the Emperor did not love him. These are the ones who, though kin, were not good and thus received punishment.\n\nThen who are those whom heaven employed for their ability? They are men like Yu, Ji, and Gao Yao. How do we know this? The former kings’ book *The Punishments of Lü* records: \"The August Emperor inquired of the lower people, and the Miao had a case. It said: 'The drought is due to the excesses below; brightness is not constant, and the widowed and orphaned are not covered.' Virtue’s might is mighty, virtue’s brightness is bright. Thus, the Three Lords were named to relieve the people’s toil. Bo Yi descended with the statutes, and the wise people maintained the punishments. Yu pacified the waters and earth, and named the mountains and rivers.\"",

      "translated_text": "Ji excelled in sowing seeds, cultivating fine grains. The Three Lords accomplished their works, relying on the people. This speaks of the three sages: they were cautious in speech, prudent in conduct, refined in thought, and sought out the world’s hidden affairs and neglected benefits to serve heaven above—thus heaven turned toward their virtue. Below, they extended it to the myriad people, who received its benefits without end. Therefore, the former kings’ words say: This Dao, when broadly applied to the world, knows no exhaustion; when narrowly applied, it brings no distress. When cultivated and employed, the myriad people receive its benefits without end.\n\n*The Odes of Zhou* records: \"The sage’s virtue is as high as heaven, as vast as earth. Its illumination in the world is as firm as the earth, as steadfast as mountains. It does not split, does not collapse—like the sun’s light, like the moon’s brightness, constant as heaven and earth.\" This speaks of the sage’s virtue: resplendent, luminous, expansive, and enduring. Thus, the sage’s virtue encompasses heaven and earth.\n\nNow, if kings and lords wish to rule the world and govern the feudal lords, without virtue and righteousness, what will they rely upon? Their doctrine must surely grasp awe-inspiring might. Yet where will kings and lords obtain such awe-inspiring might? The people’s ruin is their death. The living desire life intensely, and death they detest above all. When what they desire is unattainable and what they detest arrives repeatedly, from ancient times to the present, none have been able to rule the world and govern the feudal lords by such means.\n\nNow, if lords wish to rule the world and govern the feudal lords, desiring their will to prevail in the world and their names to endure in later generations, they must first examine the foundation of exalting the worthy in governance. This is the profound practice of sages.\n\n**Exalting the Worthy, Part Ten**\nMaster Mozi said: The kings and lords of the world all desire their states to be prosperous, their people numerous, and their laws well-ordered. Yet they do not recognize that exalting the worthy in governance is the foundation for their states and people. The root error of kings and lords lies in neglecting this foundation. If kings and lords have indeed lost this foundation, can we not illustrate it with examples?\n\nSuppose there were a feudal lord governing his state who declared: \"All in my state who are skilled in archery and charioteering, I will reward and honor. Those unskilled in archery and charioteering, I will punish and degrade.\" Among the knights of his state, who would rejoice and who would fear? I believe the skilled would rejoice, and the unskilled would fear. By rewarding them, I would guide them, saying: \"All in my state who are loyal and trustworthy, I will reward and honor. Those disloyal and untrustworthy, I will punish and degrade.\" Among the knights of his state, who would rejoice and who would fear? I believe the loyal and trustworthy would rejoice, and the disloyal and untrustworthy would fear.\n\nNow, if one governs the state and people by exalting the worthy, it encourages the good and discourages the violent. Applied broadly to the world, it encourages the good and discourages the violent throughout. Why then did I formerly esteem the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu? Because they governed the people by facing the multitude, issuing policies that ordered the people, enabling the good in the world to be encouraged and the violent to be discouraged. Thus, exalting the worthy is identical to the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu.\n\nYet today, the scholar-officials of the world, in their dwellings and speech, all exalt the worthy. But when it comes to facing the multitude, issuing policies, and ordering the people, none know to exalt the worthy and employ the capable. From this, I know that the scholar-officials of the world perceive minor matters clearly but fail to grasp the greater ones. How do I know this?\n\nIf a king or lord possesses cattle and sheep but cannot slaughter them, he must seek a skilled butcher. If he has garments but cannot tailor them, he must seek a skilled artisan. In such matters, even if they have close kin—unexpectedly wealthy, noble, or fair of face—knowing they are incapable, they do not employ them. Why? They fear the ruin of their property.\n\nYet when it comes to their states, it is not so. Kings and lords appoint their close kin, the unexpectedly wealthy, noble, or fair of face. Thus, their concern for their states is not as great as their concern for a broken bow, a lame horse, garments, cattle, or sheep. From this, I know that the scholar-officials of the world are clear about minor matters but unclear about major ones. This is like employing the emaciated as envoys or the deaf as music masters.\n\nTherefore, when the ancient sage-kings governed the world, those they enriched and honored were not necessarily their close kin, the unexpectedly wealthy, noble, or fair of face. Thus, Shun plowed at Mount Li, made pottery by the riverbank, fished at Thunder Marsh, and burned shells at Changyang. Yao found him at the southern bank of Fuze and made him Son of Heaven, entrusting him with the world’s governance and the ordering of its people. Yi Yin was a servant to the daughter of the Xin clan and worked as a cook. Tang discovered and elevated him, making him one of the Three Dukes, entrusting him with the world’s governance and the ordering of its people.",

      "translated_text": "In the writings of the former kings, the *Jian Nian* thus states: “Ah! The sagely and martial know men, employing them as screens and aids to their own persons.”\n\nThis speaks of how the former kings governed the world: they invariably selected the worthy to serve as their close ministers and assistants. It is said: Now, all the gentlemen and noble men under heaven desire wealth and honor while detesting poverty and lowliness. It is asked: How then may one attain wealth and honor and avoid poverty and lowliness? There is no better way than to become worthy. But how is the Way of becoming worthy to be pursued? It is said: Those with strength should swiftly assist others; those with wealth should generously share with others; those with the Dao should earnestly instruct others. Thus, the hungry will be fed, the cold clothed, and the disordered governed. If the hungry are fed, the cold clothed, and the disordered governed, this is the peace of all living things.\n\nYet today, the wealth and honor of kings, dukes, and great men are bestowed upon their own flesh and blood—those who, without cause, enjoy wealth and honor, whose faces are fair. Now, these kin of kings, dukes, and great men—those who, without cause, enjoy wealth and honor and whose faces are fair—how can they necessarily possess wisdom? If they lack wisdom and are tasked with governing their states, the disorder of those states may be foreseen.\n\nNow, all the gentlemen and noble men under heaven desire wealth and honor while detesting poverty and lowliness. How then may one attain wealth and honor and avoid poverty and lowliness? It is said: There is no better way than to become kin of kings, dukes, and great men—those who, without cause, enjoy wealth and honor and whose faces are fair. Yet this is not something that can be learned. Even if one lacks discernment, even if one’s virtue and conduct are as profound as those of Yu, Tang, Wen, or Wu, one will not thereby gain favor. Even if the kin of kings, dukes, and great men are deaf, blind, or crippled, even if they suddenly become like Jie or Zhou, they will not thereby lose favor.\n\nThus, when rewards do not correspond to worthiness and punishments do not correspond to wickedness, those who are rewarded are undeserving, and those who are punished are blameless. This causes the people to lose heart and scatter, to be discouraged from doing good. They withhold the strength of their limbs and do not labor for one another; they let their surplus wealth rot and do not share it; they conceal good teachings and do not instruct one another. Thus, the hungry are not fed, the cold are not clothed, and the disordered are not governed.\n\nExtending this upward, we see that in ancient times, Yao had Shun, Shun had Yu, Yu had Gao Yao, Tang had his humble minister, and King Wu had Hong Yao, Tai Dian, Nan Gong Kuo, and San Yi Sheng. Through them, the world was harmonized, and the common people flourished. Thus, those near were at peace, and those far away submitted. Wherever the sun and moon shone, wherever boats and carts reached, wherever rain and dew moistened, wherever grain nourished—all received this without need for exhortation or praise.\n\nNow, if the kings, dukes, great men, gentlemen, and noble men under heaven truly wish to practice benevolence and righteousness, to become the highest of men, to follow the Way of the sagely kings above and to bring benefit to their states and people below, they must not fail to examine this teaching on esteeming the worthy. For esteeming the worthy is the benefit of Heaven, the spirits, and the people, and the foundation of governance.",

If you can select men and reverently administer justice, the Way of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu may be attained.”\n\nWhy is this so? It is through esteeming worthies that such heights are reached.",

      "translated_text": "Mozi spoke, saying: In ancient times, when the people first came into being and there was yet no ordered government, their speech held divergent meanings. Thus, one person had one sense of right, two people had two senses, and ten people had ten senses. The more numerous the people, the more numerous their notions of right. Each person affirmed their own sense of right and rejected that of others, so they mutually condemned one another. Within, fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers, became resentful and hostile, scattering and unable to unite in harmony. The hundred clans of the world all harmed one another with water, fire, poison, and weapons. Even when they had surplus strength, they did not use it to aid one another; when they had excess wealth and skill, they did not share it; when they possessed good ways, they concealed them and did not teach them. The disorder of the world was like that of birds and beasts.\n\nNow, the reason the world fell into chaos was the absence of rulers and leaders. Therefore, the worthy and capable among the world were selected and established as the Son of Heaven. Once the Son of Heaven was established, considering his power insufficient, he further selected the worthy and capable of the world and appointed them as the Three Dukes. After the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes were established, given the vastness of the world, the distant lands and foreign peoples, and the myriad distinctions of right and wrong, benefit and harm, which could not be clearly known all at once, the world was divided into ten thousand states, and feudal lords were set up as rulers. Once the feudal lords were established, considering their power insufficient, they further selected the worthy and capable within their states and appointed them as local officials.\n\nWhen the officials were all in place, the Son of Heaven issued decrees to the hundred clans of the world, saying: \"When you hear of good or bad, you must report it to your superiors. What your superiors affirm, you must all affirm; what they reject, you must all reject. If your superiors err, admonish them; if your subordinates do good, recommend them. Those who align above and do not collude below—these are the ones the superiors reward and the people praise. But if you hear of good or bad and do not report it to your superiors, if you cannot affirm what your superiors affirm or reject what they reject, if you do not admonish their errors or recommend the good of your subordinates, if you collude below and do not align above—these are the ones the superiors punish and the people condemn.\" The superiors used this as the basis for rewards and punishments, making their scrutiny clear and trustworthy.\n\nThus, the village head was the virtuous person of the village. The village head issued decrees to the hundred clans of the village, saying: \"When you hear of good or bad, you must report it to the district head. What the district head affirms, you must all affirm; what he rejects, you must all reject. Abandon your improper words and learn the district head’s good words. Abandon your improper conduct and learn the district head’s good conduct. Then how could the district be disordered?\" Examining why the district was well-governed: the district head alone unified the sense of right in the district, and thus the district was governed.\n\nThe district head was the virtuous person of the district. The district head issued decrees to the hundred clans of the district, saying: \"When you hear of good or bad, you must report it to the feudal lord. What the feudal lord affirms, you must all affirm; what he rejects, you must all reject. Abandon your improper words and learn the feudal lord’s good words. Abandon your improper conduct and learn the feudal lord’s good conduct. Then how could the state be disordered?\" Examining why the state was well-governed: the feudal lord alone unified the sense of right in the state, and thus the state was governed.\n\nThe feudal lord was the virtuous person of the state.

Abandon your improper conduct and learn the Son of Heaven’s good conduct. Then how could the world be disordered?\" Examining why the world was well-governed: the Son of Heaven alone unified the sense of right in the world, and thus the world was governed.\n\nIf the hundred clans of the world all aligned above with the One in Heaven but did not align above with Heaven, the old disorder would not yet be gone. Now, when whirlwinds and bitter rains come ceaselessly, this is Heaven’s way of punishing the people for not aligning above with Heaven. Therefore, Mozi said: In ancient times, the sage-kings established the five punishments to govern their people, like the guiding threads of silk and the main ropes of nets, to restrain and gather the hundred clans of the world who did not align above with their superiors.\n\nMozi said: In the present age, reverting to the time when the people first came into being and had no rulers or leaders, their speech held divergent meanings. Thus, one person had one sense of right, ten people had ten senses, and a hundred people had a hundred senses. The more numerous the people, the more numerous their notions of right. Each person affirmed their own sense of right and rejected that of others, so they mutually condemned one another.

Even when they had surplus strength, they did not use it to aid one another; when they possessed good ways, they concealed them and did not teach them; when they had excess wealth and skill, they did not share it. The disorder of the world was like that of birds and beasts. Without the norms of ruler and subject, superior and inferior, elder and younger, without the rites of father and son and elder and younger brother, the world fell into chaos.\n\nUnderstanding that the people had no rulers or leaders to unify the sense of right in the world, and thus the world was in chaos, they selected the worthy, good, sagely, wise, eloquent, and discerning among the world and established them as the Son of Heaven, to undertake the task of unifying the sense of right in the world. Once the Son of Heaven was established, considering that his own ears and eyes alone could not unify the sense of right in the world, he selected the assisting, examining, worthy, good, sagely, wise, eloquent, and discerning among the world and appointed them as the Three Dukes, to join in the task of unifying the sense of right in the world.",

      "translated_text": "The Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes having been established, considering the vastness of the world and that the people of distant mountains and remote lands could not be uniformly governed, they divided the world and set up the lords of ten thousand feudal states, charging them with the task of unifying the sense of right within their domains. Once the feudal lords were established, considering that their own ears and eyes alone could not unify the sense of right within their states, they selected the worthy within their domains and appointed them as generals, ministers, and great officers, extending down to the heads of villages and hamlets, to join in the task of unifying the sense of right within their states. The rulers of the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords, the leaders of the people, were thus settled.\n\nThe Son of Heaven issued decrees and promulgated teachings, saying: \"Whenever one sees or hears of good, one must report it to one’s superior; whenever one sees or hears of wrong, one must likewise report it to one’s superior. What one’s superior approves, one must also approve; what one’s superior disapproves, one must also disapprove. If one has goodness, one should recommend it to one’s peers; if one’s superior has faults, one should admonish them. One should align with one’s superior in sense of right and harbor no intention of colluding with inferiors. Those whom the superior deems worthy shall be rewarded, and all the people, upon hearing of it, shall praise them. But if one sees or hears of good and does not report it to one’s superior, or sees or hears of wrong and likewise does not report it; if one cannot approve what one’s superior approves or disapprove what one’s superior disapproves; if one has goodness but does not recommend it to one’s peers, or if one’s superior has faults but one does not admonish them; if one colludes with inferiors to oppose one’s superior—those whom the superior deems guilty shall be punished, and all the people, upon hearing of it, shall condemn them.\"\n\nThus, the sage kings of antiquity in administering punishments, rewards, and commendations were most discerning and meticulous in their scrutiny, ensuring trustworthiness. As a result, all the people under heaven desired to obtain the rewards and commendations of their superiors and feared their censure and punishment. Therefore, the village heads followed the policies of the Son of Heaven and unified the sense of right within their villages. Once the village heads had unified the sense of right within their villages, they led the people of their villages to align with the heads of their townships, saying: \"All the people of the village must align with the township head and not dare to collude with inferiors. What the township head approves, they must also approve; what the township head disapproves, they must also disapprove. They must discard unwholesome speech and learn the wholesome speech of the township head; they must discard unwholesome conduct and learn the wholesome conduct of the township head. The township head is indeed the worthiest in the township. If all the people of the township model themselves after the township head, how could the township not be well-governed?\" Examining how the township head governs the township, by what means does he do so? It is said: \"Only by his ability to unify the sense of right within the township, and thus the township is well-governed.\"\n\nOnce the townships within the domain were well-governed, they led the people of their townships to align with the feudal lord, saying: \"All the people of the township must align with the feudal lord and not dare to collude with inferiors. What the feudal lord approves, they must also approve; what the feudal lord disapproves, they must also disapprove. They must discard unwholesome speech and learn the wholesome speech of the feudal lord; they must discard unwholesome conduct and learn the wholesome conduct of the feudal lord. The feudal lord is indeed the worthiest in the state. If all the people of the state model themselves after the feudal lord, how could the state not be well-governed?\" Examining how the feudal lord governs the state and achieves good governance, by what means does he do so? It is said: \"Only by his ability to unify the sense of right within the state, and thus the state is well-governed.\"\n\nOnce the feudal lord had governed his state and achieved good governance, he led the people of his state to align with the Son of Heaven, saying: \"All the people of the state must align with the Son of Heaven and not dare to collude with inferiors. What the Son of Heaven approves, they must also approve; what the Son of Heaven disapproves, they must also disapprove. They must discard unwholesome speech and learn the wholesome speech of the Son of Heaven; they must discard unwholesome conduct and learn the wholesome conduct of the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven is indeed the most benevolent person under heaven. If all the people under heaven model themselves after the Son of Heaven, how could the world not be well-governed?\" Examining how the Son of Heaven governs the world, by what means does he do so? It is said: \"Only by his ability to unify the sense of right under heaven, and thus the world is well-governed.\"\n\nYet if one aligns with the Son of Heaven but does not align with Heaven, then the calamities of Heaven will not cease. Thus, when Heaven sends unseasonable cold and heat, untimely snow, frost, rain, and dew, when the five grains do not ripen, the six livestock do not thrive, when plagues and epidemics, whirlwinds and bitter rains arrive in succession, these are the punishments sent down by Heaven to penalize those below who do not align with Heaven. Therefore, the sage kings of antiquity understood what Heaven and the spirits desired and avoided what Heaven and the spirits detested, seeking to promote the benefit of the world and eliminate its harm. Thus, they led the people under heaven to fast, bathe, and purify themselves, preparing clear wine, sweet liquor, and pure grain offerings to sacrifice to Heaven and the spirits. In serving the ghosts and spirits, they dared not be remiss in the purity of their wine, liquor, and grain offerings; they dared not offer lean or scrawny sacrificial animals; they dared not present jade tablets, silk, or cloth that did not meet the proper measures; they dared not miss the proper times for spring and autumn sacrifices; they dared not judge cases unjustly; they dared not distribute wealth unfairly; and they dared not be negligent in their dwellings.\n\nThey said: \"If the leaders are like this, then when they issue punishments and achieve victory, by what means do they do so?\" It is said: \"Only by governing through alignment with the superior.\" Thus, the sage kings of antiquity governed in this manner.\n\nNow, the people of the world say: \"In the present age, the blessings of Heaven and the spirits can be obtained. If one can vigorously pursue what is convenient and beneficial for the people, then the affection of the people can be won.\" Governing in this manner, when they plan affairs, their undertakings succeed; when they defend their territory, it is secure. Above, Heaven and the spirits bestow abundant favor upon their leaders; below, the people enjoy the convenience and benefit of their leaders. If Heaven and the spirits deeply favor them and they vigorously pursue their tasks, then the leaders under heaven will not yet have abandoned their roles, so why is it that the world is in chaos?",

      "translated_text": "Master Mozi said: In the present age, the way of governing through rulers and leaders fundamentally differs from that of antiquity. It is like measuring with the five punishments. In former times, the sage kings established the five punishments to govern the world, yet when the Miao people later applied the five punishments, they threw the world into chaos. Was this because the punishments themselves were not good? No—it was because their use of punishments was not good. Thus, the ancient kings’ text *The Way of Punishments* states: \"The Miao people, in their perversity, twisted punishments into mutilation, creating the five deadly penalties, calling them 'the law.'\" This shows that those who use punishments well govern the people, while those who use them poorly turn them into instruments of slaughter. Was this because the punishments themselves were not good? No—it was because their use of punishments was not good, and so they became instruments of slaughter.\n\nThus, the ancient kings’ text *The Way of Decrees* states: \"The mouth can utter goodness or provoke war.\" This means that those who use speech well bring forth goodness, while those who use it poorly create slander, treachery, and strife. Was this because the mouth itself was not good? No—it was because their use of speech was not good, and so it became slander, treachery, and strife.\n\nTherefore, in antiquity, rulers and leaders were established to govern the people. They were like the guiding threads in silk or the main ropes in a fishing net, meant to mobilize the world, curb excess and violence, and unify its principles. Thus, the ancient kings’ text *The Way of Yearly Governance* states: \"When establishing states and founding capitals, they appointed kings, dukes, and lords. If they acted arrogantly, they were to be restrained; if high ministers and generals acted indolently, they were to be corrected. Only those skilled in governance were to equalize the world.\" This describes how the ancient gods and spirits established states, capitals, rulers, and leaders—not to elevate their ranks, enrich their emoluments, or grant them ease and luxury, but to enable them to promote benefit, eliminate harm, enrich the poor, aid the few, and bring order to danger and chaos. Thus did the sage kings of antiquity act.\n\nNow, the kings, dukes, and great officials of today administer punishments and governance in a manner contrary to this. They appoint as rulers and leaders those they find convenient, relying on their fathers, elder brothers, old friends, and trusted aides. The people know that those placed in positions of leadership are not truly fit to govern them, and so they all form cliques, conceal their actions, and refuse to align with their superiors. Thus, superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles. If superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles, then rewards and praise are insufficient to encourage goodness, and punishments and penalties are insufficient to deter violence.\n\nHow do we know this is so? Consider: if a ruler establishes governance in a state and appoints leaders for the people, saying, \"This person is worthy of reward; I will reward them,\" yet if superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles, then what the superior rewards, the multitude condemns. The people will say, \"This person lives among us, and we know them to be unworthy.\" Thus, even if they receive the superior’s reward, it is not enough to encourage goodness. Or if a ruler establishes governance in a state and appoints leaders for the people, saying, \"This person is worthy of punishment; I will punish them,\" yet if superiors and inferiors do not share the same principles, then what the superior punishes, the multitude praises. The people will say, \"This person lives among us, and we know them to be worthy.\" Thus, even if they receive the superior’s punishment, it is not enough to deter violence.\n\nIf a ruler establishes governance in a state and appoints leaders for the people, yet rewards and praise are insufficient to encourage goodness, and punishments and penalties are insufficient to deter violence, then is this not the same as the time before rulers and leaders existed, when people crouched in submission? If having rulers and leaders is no different from having none, then this is not the way to govern the people and unify the multitude.\n\nTherefore, the sage kings of antiquity used alignment with the superior as the principle for establishing rulers and leaders. In this way, the sentiments of superiors and inferiors were communicated without obstruction. If superiors had hidden affairs or overlooked benefits, inferiors could bring them to light and utilize them. If inferiors harbored grievances or accumulated harm, superiors could discover and eliminate them. Thus, even if someone thousands of miles away did good, though their household did not yet know and their village had not yet heard, the Son of Heaven could reward them. Even if someone thousands of miles away did evil, though their household did not yet know and their village had not yet heard, the Son of Heaven could punish them. As a result, all the people under heaven trembled in fear, dared not act with excess or violence, and said: \"The eyes and ears of the world are as if divine!\"\n\nThe words of the former kings state: \"It is not divine. It is simply that one can make the ears and eyes of others assist in seeing and hearing, make the mouths of others assist in speaking, make the minds of others assist in thinking, and make the limbs of others assist in acting. When many assist in seeing and hearing, what one perceives and knows extends far. When many assist in speaking, the reach of one’s virtuous influence is broad. When many assist in thinking, one’s plans and deliberations are swift and sound. When many assist in acting, one’s tasks are swiftly accomplished.\" Thus, the reason the sage kings of antiquity succeeded in their affairs, achieved their goals, and left their names to later generations was no other cause or strange circumstance—it was simply that they were able to govern through alignment with the superior.\n\nThus, the ancient kings’ text *The Odes of Zhou* states: \"They come to see their king, seeking his standards.\" This describes how the feudal lords of antiquity, in spring and autumn, came to the court of the Son of Heaven to receive his stern teachings. Returning to govern their states, wherever their governance extended, none dared disobey. At that time, there was fundamentally no one who dared to disrupt the Son of Heaven’s teachings. The *Odes* says:\n*\"My horses are black-maned,\nThe six reins smooth and supple.\nWe gallop and drive,\nEverywhere seeking counsel and deliberation.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"My horses are fine steeds,\nThe six reins like silk.\nWe gallop and drive,\nEverywhere seeking plans and strategies.\"*\nThis is what it means.\n\nIn antiquity, when the feudal lords heard of good or evil, they galloped to report it to the Son of Heaven. Thus, rewards befitted the worthy, punishments befitted the violent, the innocent were not killed, and the guilty were not spared. This was the achievement of alignment with the superior.",

      "translated_text": "Thus Master Mozi declared: Now, the kings, dukes, grandees, and gentlemen of the world—if they truly wish to enrich their states, multiply their people, order their penal governance, and secure their altars of soil and grain—they must examine with utmost care this principle of *shangtong* (alignment with the superior), for it is the very foundation.\n\n*Shangtong, Part Thirteen*\nMaster Mozi stated: The task of the wise is necessarily this—to deliberate on what brings order to the state and its people and act accordingly, and to deliberate on what brings chaos to the state and its people and avoid it.\n\nNow, what brings order to the state and its people? When those above in governance obtain the true sentiments of those below, there is order; when they do not, there is chaos. How do we know this is so? When those above in governance obtain the true sentiments of those below, they thereby clarify for the people what is good and what is not. If they truly clarify for the people what is good and what is not, then they can reward the good and punish the violent. When the good are rewarded and the violent are punished, the state is necessarily ordered. When those above in governance do not obtain the true sentiments of those below, they thereby fail to clarify for the people what is good and what is not. If they truly fail to clarify for the people what is good and what is not, then they cannot reward the good or punish the violent. When the good are not rewarded and the violent are not punished, governance in this manner will inevitably plunge the multitude into chaos. Thus, the failure to obtain the true sentiments of those below is something that cannot but be examined.\n\nNow, how can one obtain the true sentiments of those below? Master Mozi said: Only by governing through *shangtong* and unifying the standard can this be achieved. How do we know that *shangtong* and unifying the standard can govern the world? Why not carefully examine the governance of antiquity? In ancient times, when Heaven first brought forth the people, there were no rulers or leaders, and the hundred clans acted as individuals. If the hundred clans acted as individuals, then one person had one standard, ten people had ten standards, a hundred people had a hundred standards, a thousand people had a thousand standards—extending to the point where the multitude of people could not be counted, and thus their so-called standards could not be counted either. Each regarded their own standard as right and others’ standards as wrong, leading to those with strength causing harm and those with lesser strength engaging in strife. Therefore, the world desired to unify the world’s standard. Thus, they selected the worthy and established them as the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven, considering his knowledge and strength insufficient to govern the world alone, selected the next best and established them as the Three Dukes. The Three Dukes, considering their knowledge and strength insufficient to assist the Son of Heaven alone, divided the land and enfeoffed the feudal lords. The feudal lords, considering their knowledge and strength insufficient to govern their territories alone, selected the next best and established them as ministers and stewards. The ministers and stewards, considering their knowledge and strength insufficient to assist their lords alone, selected the next best and established them as village chiefs and household heads. Thus, in ancient times, the Son of Heaven established the Three Dukes, and the feudal lords, ministers, stewards, village chiefs, and household heads were not chosen merely for their wealth, nobility, or leisure, but to assist in ordering governance and penal affairs. Therefore, in ancient times, when establishing states and founding capitals, they set up kings, dukes, and lords, and appointed ministers, officers, and leaders—not to indulge in pleasure, but to distinguish right from wrong and assist in governance and illumination.\n\nNow, why is it that those above cannot govern those below, and those below cannot serve those above? It is because superiors and inferiors disdain one another. Why is this so? Because their standards differ. If those with differing standards form factions, and the superior regards someone as good, others will slander them. If that person only seeks the superior’s reward and avoids the people’s slander, then those who do good will not necessarily be encouraged, for they see the reward. If the superior regards someone as violent, they will punish them, but that person may only receive the superior’s punishment while harboring the people’s praise. Thus, the violent will not necessarily be deterred, for they see the punishment. Therefore, the superior’s rewards and praise are insufficient to encourage the good, and their slander and punishment are insufficient to deter the violent. Why is this so? Because the desire to unify the world’s standard—how can this be achieved?\n\nThus Master Mozi said: Why not have the household heads test this by issuing decrees and proclamations to their households, saying: \"If you see anyone who loves and benefits the household, you must report it; if you see anyone who harms and plunders the household, you must also report it.\" If someone reports one who loves and benefits the household, they are like one who loves and benefits the household. The superior will reward them, and the multitude will praise them. If someone sees one who harms and plunders the household but does not report it, they are like one who harms and plunders the household. The superior will punish them, and the multitude will condemn them. Thus, all within the household will desire to obtain their superiors’ rewards and praise and avoid their slander and punishment. Therefore, when good words are spoken, the household head can reward the good and punish the violent. When the good are rewarded and the violent are punished, the household is necessarily ordered. Now, what brings order to the household? It is solely through governing by *shangtong* and unifying the standard.\n\nYet, if the way to order a household is entirely this, does it suffice for the state? It does not. The households in the world are exceedingly numerous, each regarding their own household as right and others’ households as wrong, leading to those with strength causing chaos and those with lesser strength engaging in strife. Therefore, the household heads are further made to gather their households and align with the feudal lord. The feudal lord also issues decrees and proclamations to the multitude of the state, saying: \"If you see anyone who loves and benefits the state, you must report it; if you see anyone who harms and plunders the state, you must also report it. If someone reports one who loves and benefits the state, they are like one who loves and benefits the state. The superior will reward them, and the multitude will praise them.\"",

Therefore, when used on a grand scale, it governs the world without deficiency; when used on a small scale, it governs a state or a household without excess. This is what is meant by the Dao/Way. Hence it is said: governing the states of the world is like governing a single household; commanding the people of the world is like commanding a single man.\n\nIs this idea unique to Master Mozi, while the former kings lacked it? It is not so. The sage-kings all governed by aligning with the One Dao/Way, and thus the world was well-governed. How do we know this is so? In the books of the former kings, the *Great Declaration* states: \"When petty men see deceit and craftiness yet do not report it, the punishment is equal.\" This means that those who see depravity and perversion yet fail to report it bear the same guilt as the depraved and perverse. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity governed the world by selecting those of excellence to assist them as their wings, and those outside who aided their vision and hearing were many. Therefore, when consulting with others on matters, they were the first to understand; when undertaking tasks with others, they were the first to accomplish them. Their virtuous reputation and fame preceded others. They trusted themselves and acted accordingly, thus reaping such benefits.\n\nThere is an ancient saying: \"One eye’s vision does not compare to two eyes’ vision; one ear’s hearing does not compare to two ears’ hearing; one hand’s grasp does not compare to two hands’ strength.\" Only by trusting oneself and acting accordingly can such benefits be attained. Thus, when the sage-kings of antiquity governed the world, if there was a worthy person a thousand *li* away, though the people of their village had not equally heard or seen them, the sage-king would reward them. If there was a violent person within a thousand *li*, though the people of their village had not equally seen them, the sage-king would punish them. Therefore, do not assume the sage-king had ears sharp and eyes bright—how could they see clearly to a thousand *li* away with a single glance or hear clearly to a thousand *li* away with a single listening? The sage-king did not go to see nor approach to hear. Yet, why were those who caused chaos, rebellion, theft, and banditry throughout the world left with no place to stand? It was because their governance through aligning with the One Dao/Way was excellent.\n\nThus, Master Mozi said: \"In general, when making the people align with the One Dao/Way, if one does not love the people urgently, the people cannot be employed. It must be said: one must urgently love and employ them, establish trust and uphold it. Lead them with wealth and honor, and guide them with clear punishments. When governance is like this, even those who do not wish to align with me will find it impossible.\"\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: \"Now, the kings, dukes, great officials, and gentlemen of the world, if in their hearts they desire to practice benevolence and righteousness, seek to be scholars, aspire to the Dao/Way of the sages above, and benefit the states and the hundred clans below, they must examine the doctrine of aligning with the superior and recognize that aligning with the One Dao/Way is the foundation and essential method of governance.\"\n\n*End of Scroll Three of Mozi*",

If someone reports one who loves and benefits the state, they are like one who loves and benefits the state. The superior will reward them, and the multitude will praise them.\"",

      "translated_text": "The sage who takes governing the world as their duty must know from where disorder arises, only then can they govern it; without knowing from where disorder arises, they cannot govern. This is like a physician who treats a person’s illness: they must know from where the illness arises, only then can they treat it; without knowing from where the illness arises, they cannot treat it. How is governing disorder any different? One must know from where disorder arises, only then can they govern it; without knowing from where disorder arises, they cannot govern it. The sage who takes governing the world as their duty cannot but examine from where disorder arises.\n\nWhere, then, does disorder arise? It arises from lack of mutual love. When ministers and children are not filial to their lords and fathers, this is called disorder. A child loves only themselves and not their father, thus they harm their father to benefit themselves; a younger brother loves only themselves and not their elder brother, thus they harm their elder brother to benefit themselves; a minister loves only themselves and not their lord, thus they harm their lord to benefit themselves. This is what is called disorder. Even when a father is not kind to their child, an elder brother is not kind to their younger brother, or a lord is not kind to their minister, this is also what the world calls disorder. A father loves only themselves and not their child, thus they harm their child to benefit themselves; an elder brother loves only themselves and not their younger brother, thus they harm their younger brother to benefit themselves; a lord loves only themselves and not their minister, thus they harm their minister to benefit themselves. Why is this? It all arises from lack of mutual love.\n\nEven the thieves and bandits of the world are the same. A thief loves only their own household and not another’s, thus they steal from another’s household to benefit their own; a bandit loves only their own body and not others, thus they harm others to benefit themselves. Why is this? It all stems from lack of mutual love. Even the great officers who bring disorder to other households and the feudal lords who attack other states are the same. Each great officer loves only their own household and not another’s, thus they bring disorder to another’s household to benefit their own; each feudal lord loves only their own state and not another’s, thus they attack another’s state to benefit their own. All the disorders of the world are encompassed in this. From where do they arise? They all arise from lack of mutual love.\n\nIf the world were to practice universal mutual love, and each person loved others as they love themselves, how could there be those who are unfilial or unkind? If one regarded children, younger brothers, and ministers as oneself, how could there be those who are unkind or unfilial? If one regarded another’s household as their own, who would steal? If one regarded another’s body as their own, who would harm? Thus, there would be no thieves or bandits. How could there be great officers bringing disorder to other households or feudal lords attacking other states? If one regarded another’s household as their own, who would bring disorder? If one regarded another’s state as their own, who would attack? Thus, there would be no great officers bringing disorder to other households or feudal lords attacking other states.\n\nIf the world were to practice universal mutual love, states would not attack one another, households would not bring disorder to one another, there would be no thieves or bandits, and lords, ministers, fathers, and children would all be filial and kind. In this way, the world would be well-governed. Therefore, the sage who takes governing the world as their duty cannot but prohibit hatred and encourage love. Thus, when the world practices universal mutual love, it is well-governed; when it practices mutual hatred, it falls into disorder. Therefore, Master Mozi said: \"One cannot but encourage loving others.\" This is the reason.\n\n**Universal Love, Part Two**\n\nMaster Mozi said: The humane person’s duty is to promote what benefits the world and eliminate what harms it. This is their duty. What, then, are the benefits of the world? What are its harms?\n\nMaster Mozi said: When states attack one another, households usurp one another, people harm one another, lords and ministers are not kind and loyal, fathers and children are not kind and filial, and elder and younger brothers are not harmonious, these are the harms of the world. Why, then, do these harms arise? Do they arise from lack of mutual love?\n\nMaster Mozi said: They arise from lack of mutual love. Now, feudal lords love only their own states and not others’, thus they do not hesitate to mobilize their states to attack others’; household heads love only their own households and not others’, thus they do not hesitate to mobilize their households to usurp others’; people love only their own bodies and not others’, thus they do not hesitate to harm others to benefit themselves. Therefore, when feudal lords do not love one another, they inevitably engage in open warfare; when household heads do not love one another, they inevitably usurp one another; when people do not love one another, they inevitably harm one another. When lords and ministers do not love one another, they are not kind and loyal; when fathers and children do not love one another, they are not kind and filial; when elder and younger brothers do not love one another, they are not harmonious. When the people of the world do not love one another, the strong will overpower the weak, the rich will insult the poor, the noble will disdain the lowly, and the cunning will deceive the foolish. All the disasters, usurpations, grudges, and resentments of the world arise from lack of mutual love. Therefore, the humane person condemns this.\n\nHaving condemned it, how should it be changed?\n\nMaster Mozi said: It should be changed through the principle of universal mutual love and mutual benefit. How, then, should the principle of universal mutual love and mutual benefit be practiced?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Regard another’s state as one’s own, regard another’s household as one’s own, regard another’s body as one’s own. Thus, when feudal lords love one another, they will not engage in open warfare; when household heads love one another, they will not usurp one another; when people love one another, they will not harm one another. The noble will not disdain the lowly, the cunning will not deceive the foolish, and all the disasters, usurpations, grudges, and resentments of the world can be prevented. The humane person praises this.\n\nThus, when lords and ministers love one another, they are kind and loyal; when fathers and children love one another, they are kind and filial; when elder and younger brothers love one another, they are harmonious. When the people of the world all love one another, the strong will not overpower the weak, the many will not oppress the few, the rich will not insult the poor.",

      "translated_text": "In former times, King Ling of Chu favored his officers’ slender waists. Thus, King Ling’s ministers all restricted themselves to one meal a day, held their breath to tighten their belts, and leaned against walls to rise. Within a year, the court was filled with those pale from starvation. Why was this so? Because the ruler delighted in it, his ministers were able to do it.\n\nIn former times, King Goujian of Yue favored his officers’ courage. He trained and harmonized his ministers, then set fire to a boat and tested his warriors, saying: “All the treasures of Yue are here!” King Goujian personally drummed to urge his men forward. Hearing the drumbeat, they charged in disarray, trampling the flames to their deaths—over a hundred on either side. Then the king sounded the gong to withdraw.\n\nThus Master Mozi said: To eat little, wear coarse clothes, or sacrifice one’s life for fame—these are things the common people of the world all find difficult. Yet if the ruler delights in them, the masses can do them. How different is this from mutual love and mutual benefit! For one who loves others will surely be loved in return; one who benefits others will surely be benefited in return. One who hates others will surely be hated in return; one who harms others will surely be harmed in return. What difficulty could there be? The obstacle lies only in the fact that superiors do not govern by it, and scholars do not practice it.\n\nYet today, the gentlemen of the world say: “Indeed, mutual love would be excellent. However, it is an impracticable thing—like lifting Mount Tai to leap across the Yellow River.” Master Mozi said: This is not a proper analogy. To lift Mount Tai and leap across the Yellow River would require exhausting all one’s strength, and from ancient times to the present, no one has ever been able to do it. But mutual love and mutual benefit are different. The ancient sage-kings practiced them.\n\nHow do we know this? In ancient times, Yu governed the world. To the west, he opened the Western River and Yu Bao to drain the waters of Qu, Sun, and Huang. To the north, he built the Fang, Yuan, Zhuo, and Zhu embankments, the rear chambers of Hou, and the sluices of Xue Pool. He drilled through Dizhu and carved out Dragon Gate to benefit the people of Yan, Dai, Hu, Mo, and the Western River. To the east, he drained the marshes of Lu and built dikes at Zhuo Ze, dredging the Nine Channels to guide the waters of the eastern lands and benefit the people of Ji Province. To the south, he channeled the Jiang, Han, Huai, and Ru rivers eastward, directing them into the Five Lakes to benefit the people of Chu, Jing, Yue, and the southern tribes. This was Yu’s work, and it is what I now call mutual benefit.\n\nIn former times, King Wen governed the western lands. Like the sun and moon, his radiance shone in all four directions and throughout the western lands. He did not allow large states to bully small states, the multitude to oppress the orphaned and widowed, or the violent and powerful to seize the millet, grain, dogs, and pigs of the tillers. Heaven looked down with favor upon King Wen’s compassion. Thus, the elderly without children found care to live out their years; the lonely without brothers found companionship among the living; and the young who had lost their parents found support to grow up. This was King Wen’s work, and it is what I now call mutual love.\n\nIn former times, King Wu was about to perform the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai. In the *Annals*, it is recorded: “O Mount Tai! The virtuous descendant of Zhou, the king, has come to perform the great sacrifice. The great affair accomplished, the benevolent still act to reverently serve the Shang, Xia, Man, Yi, and Mo tribes. Though he had kinsmen of Zhou, they were not like the benevolent. If the myriad regions bore guilt, it would rest with me alone.” This was King Wu’s work, and it is what I now call mutual love.\n\nThus Master Mozi said: Today, the gentlemen of the world sincerely desire the scholars to be wealthy and hate their poverty; they desire the world to be well-governed and hate its chaos. They should practice mutual love and mutual benefit. This is the method of the sage-kings and the Way to govern the world. It cannot but be diligently pursued.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Universal Love (Part II)**\n\nMaster Mozi said: The task of the benevolent is necessarily to seek what benefits the world and remove what harms it. Now, in the present age, what is the greatest harm in the world? It is when large states attack small states, great families disrupt small families, the strong plunder the weak, the many oppress the few, the cunning deceive the foolish, and the noble arrogantly despise the humble. These are the harms of the world. Moreover, rulers who are not kind, ministers who are not loyal, fathers who are not compassionate, and sons who are not filial—these are also harms of the world. Furthermore, when people today despise others, wielding blades, poison, water, and fire to mutually injure and kill—these are also harms of the world.\n\nLet us trace the origin of these many harms. Where do they come from? Do they arise from loving and benefiting others? It must be said: No, they arise from hating and harming others. Now, when we distinguish the names in the world—those who hate and harm others—is this universal or partial? It must be partial. Yet this partiality is precisely what gives rise to the world’s great harms. Therefore, partiality is wrong.\n\nMaster Mozi said: To reject something, there must be something to replace it. If one rejects something without offering a replacement, it is like using water to put out fire—such an argument will surely fail. Thus Master Mozi said: Universal love must replace partiality.\n\nWhy can universal love replace partiality? Suppose one treats another’s state as one’s own. Who would then raise their state to attack another’s? Treating it as one’s own, one would act for the other as for oneself. Suppose one treats another’s capital as one’s own. Who would then raise their capital to assault another’s? Treating it as one’s own, one would act for the other as for oneself. Suppose one treats another’s family as one’s own. Who would then raise their family to disrupt another’s? Treating it as one’s own, one would act for the other as for oneself.",

The obstacle lies only in the fact that superiors do not govern by it, and scholars do not practice it.\n\nIn former times, Duke Wen of Jin favored his officers’ coarse attire. Thus, Duke Wen’s ministers all wore robes of coarse wool bound with leather belts, and caps of bleached silk. They wore these when entering to see their lord and when attending court. Why was this so? Because the ruler delighted in it, his ministers followed suit.",

      "translated_text": "Now, if states and capitals do not attack one another, and households do not disrupt or harm one another—is this a harm to the world or a benefit? It must be said: a benefit to the world. Let us trace back to the origin of all benefits. From where do they arise? Do they arise from hating and harming others? It must be said: no. They must arise from loving and benefiting others. When we distinguish the names throughout the world, is it partiality or universality that loves and benefits others? It must be said: universality. Thus, when universality is practiced in interaction, does it indeed give rise to the greatest benefit in the world? Therefore, Master Mozi said: universality is right.\n\nMoreover, I previously stated: the task of the humane person is necessarily to strive to promote the world’s benefits and eliminate its harms. Now, tracing back to the origin, we see that universality gives rise to the world’s greatest benefits, while partiality gives rise to its greatest harms. Therefore, Master Mozi said: partiality is wrong and universality is right—they differ as clearly as square and round.\n\nNow, I will rightly seek and obtain the world’s benefits, taking universality as the standard. Thus, ears and eyes assist one another in seeing and hearing, limbs are fully strong to act and serve, and those with the Dao freely instruct one another. Therefore, the elderly without wives or children have support to complete their years, and the young, weak, and orphaned without parents have refuge to grow to maturity. Now, if only universality is taken as the standard, such are its benefits.\n\nYet why do all under heaven, upon hearing of universality, oppose it? What is the reason for this? Nevertheless, the scholars of the world who criticize the words of universality have not ceased. They say: it is good, but can it truly be implemented? Master Mozi said: if it is implemented yet deemed impossible, this too would be a criticism. Moreover, where is there goodness that cannot be implemented?\n\nLet us tentatively advance two men and compare them. Suppose one man holds to partiality and the other to universality. The partial man says: how can I treat my friend’s body as my own, or my friend’s kin as my own kin? Thus, when he retreats and observes his friend, if the friend is hungry, he does not feed him; if cold, he does not clothe him; if ill or diseased, he does not attend to him; if dead, he does not bury him. Such are the words and deeds of the partial man.\n\nThe universal man’s words are not so, nor are his deeds. He says: I have heard that to be a noble man in the world, one must treat one’s friend’s body as one’s own and one’s friend’s kin as one’s own kin—only then can one be a noble man in the world. Thus, when he retreats and observes his friend, if the friend is hungry, he feeds him; if cold, he clothes him; if ill or diseased, he attends to him; if dead, he buries him. Such are the aspirations and deeds of the universal man.\n\nNow, between these two, are their words opposed and their deeds contrary? If we make these two men keep their word and act resolutely, so that their words and deeds align like tallying tokens, with no word left unfulfilled—then let me ask: suppose there is a vast plain here, and one dons armor and helmet to go forth, not knowing whether life or death awaits. Or suppose a lord’s minister is sent on a distant mission to Ba, Yue, Qi, or Jing, and it is uncertain whether he will return or not. Let me ask: in such cases, to whom would one entrust one’s household, support one’s kin, and entrust one’s wife and children? Would one entrust them to the universal man or the partial man? I believe that in such a situation, even the foolish men and women of the world, though not universal themselves, would necessarily entrust them to the universal man. If this is so, then to speak against universality while choosing it in practice is to acknowledge its worth.\n\nYet why do the scholars of the world, upon hearing of universality, still oppose it? Their criticism has not ceased. They say: perhaps one can choose men, but one cannot choose rulers. Let us tentatively advance two rulers and compare them. Suppose one ruler holds to universality and the other to partiality. The partial ruler says: how can I treat the bodies of my myriad people as my own? This is far from the sentiment of the world. Human life upon the earth is but a brief moment—like a team of four horses galloping past a crack. Thus, when he retreats and observes his myriad people, if they are hungry, he does not feed them; if cold, he does not clothe them; if ill or diseased, he does not attend to them; if dead, he does not bury them. Such are the words and deeds of the partial ruler.\n\nThe universal ruler’s words are not so, nor are his deeds. He says: I have heard that to be an enlightened ruler in the world, one must first treat the bodies of the myriad people as one’s own, and only afterward attend to oneself—only then can one be an enlightened ruler in the world. Thus, when he retreats and observes his myriad people, if they are hungry, he feeds them; if cold, he clothes them; if ill or diseased, he attends to them; if dead, he buries them. Such are the words and deeds of the universal ruler.\n\nNow, between these two rulers, are their words opposed and their deeds contrary? If we make these two rulers keep their word and act resolutely, so that their words and deeds align like tallying tokens, with no word left unfulfilled—then let me ask: suppose in this year there is a plague, and the myriad people suffer hardship, cold, and hunger, with many dying and their bodies filling the ditches. Between these two rulers, whom would one follow? I believe that in such a situation, even the foolish men and women of the world, though not universal rulers themselves, would necessarily follow the universal ruler.",

      "translated_text": "To speak yet not embrace universality is to choose words and deeds that contradict. Yet why is it that all under heaven hear of universality only to reject it? Nevertheless, the scholars of the world who oppose universality have not ceased, saying: \"Universality is indeed benevolence and righteousness. Yet how can it be practiced?\" I compare the impracticability of universality to lifting Mount Tai and leaping over the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. Thus, universality is but a wish—how could it be a realizable thing?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Lifting Mount Tai to leap over the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers—from ancient times to the present, since the birth of humankind, this has never been done. Yet as for mutual love and mutual benefit, the former sage-kings—the Six Kings—personally practiced them. How do we know the former sage-kings personally practiced them? Master Mozi said: I did not exist in the same era or time as they, nor did I personally hear their voices or see their faces. I know this from what they inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, engraved on basins and bowls, and transmitted to later generations.\n\n*The Great Declaration* says: \"King Wen was like the sun and moon shining together, illuminating the four directions and the western lands.\" These words describe King Wen’s universal love for all under heaven, vast and boundless—like the sun and moon illuminating the world without partiality. Thus, King Wen practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks takes its model from King Wen.\n\nMoreover, not only *The Great Declaration* speaks thus; even *Yu’s Oath* is the same. Yu said: \"All you assembled multitudes, heed my words. It is not that I, this humble one, dare to act with reckless disorder. The Miao people are foolish and rebellious, and thus I carry out Heaven’s punishment. As I have led you to battle the drought and march against the Miao...\" Yu’s campaign against the Miao was not to seek greater wealth or honor, nor to indulge his ears and eyes, but to promote the benefit of all under heaven and eliminate its harms. Thus, Yu practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks seeks its model in Yu.\n\nFurthermore, not only the oaths and commands are thus; even *Tang’s Address* is the same. Tang said: \"I, this humble Lü, dare to offer a black bull and declare to the Supreme Lord and Sovereign Above: Now there is a great drought, and it is I who bear the blame. I do not dare to conceal goodness nor pardon faults; it is all recorded in the Emperor’s heart. If the myriad regions have faults, let them be upon me. If I have faults, let them not extend to the myriad regions.\" These words show that Tang, though noble as Son of Heaven and wealthy as lord of all under heaven, did not shrink from offering himself as a sacrifice to pray to the Supreme Lord and spirits. Thus, Tang practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks takes its model from Tang.\n\nMoreover, not only the oaths, commands, and Tang’s address are thus; even the *Zhou Poems* are the same. The *Zhou Poems* say:\n\"The kingly Way is vast and boundless,\nImpartial and without faction.\nThe kingly Way is level and smooth,\nWithout faction or partiality.\nStraight as an arrow, smooth as a whetstone,\nWhat the noble man treads, what the petty man beholds.\"\nDo my words not speak of the Way? In ancient times, Kings Wen and Wu upheld justice, equally rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent, without favoring kin or brothers. Thus, Wen and Wu practiced universality. Even the universality of which Master Mozi speaks takes its model from Wen and Wu.\n\nYet why is it that all under heaven hear of universality only to reject it? Nevertheless, those who oppose universality have not ceased, saying: \"Does this not harm the interests of one’s parents and thus fail to be filial?\" Master Mozi said: Let us examine the considerations of a filial son who plans for his parents. Do I not know whether a filial son, in planning for his parents, wishes others to love and benefit them, or to hate and harm them? Judging by reason, he must wish others to love and benefit them. Then how should I first act to achieve this? If I first act to love and benefit others’ parents, will they then repay me by loving and benefiting mine? Or if I first act to hate others’ parents, will they then repay me by loving and benefiting mine? It must be that I first act to love and benefit others’ parents, and then they will repay me by loving and benefiting mine. Thus, the exchange of filial sons is indeed unavoidable. Should we not first act to love and benefit others’ parents? Or do we consider the filial sons of the world to be misguided and insufficient as a standard?\n\nLet us examine what the former kings recorded in the *Greater Odes*:\n\"No word goes unanswered,\nNo virtue goes unrewarded.\nCast me a peach, and I return a plum.\"\nThese words mean that those who love others will surely be loved, and those who hate others will surely be hated.\n\nYet why is it that the scholars of the world all hear of universality only to reject it? Do they consider it difficult and impossible to practice? Yet there have been things more difficult than this that were possible.",

At that moment, none retreated without the drum’s command; the warriors of Yue could be called resolute.

Yet I believe there are none among the rulers who advocate for it. If only there were rulers who did, encouraging it with rewards and praise, and enforcing it with penalties and punishments, then I believe people would embrace universal love and mutual benefit as naturally as fire rises upward or water flows downward—impossible to prevent throughout the world.\n\nThus, universality is the Dao of the sagely kings, the means by which kings, dukes, and great ministers secure their peace, and the reason the common people have sufficient clothing and food. Therefore, the noble person would do well to examine universality and strive to practice it: as a ruler, be benevolent; as a minister, be loyal; as a father, be kind; as a son, be filial; as an elder brother, be affectionate; as a younger brother, be respectful.\n\nThus, the noble person should desire to be a benevolent ruler, a loyal minister, a kind father, a filial son, an affectionate elder brother, or a respectful younger brother.

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nNow, suppose there is a man who enters another’s garden and orchard, stealing their peaches and plums. The multitude hears of it and condemns him; the ruler who governs above, if he apprehends him, punishes him. Why is this? Because he harms others to benefit himself. When it comes to seizing another’s dogs, pigs, geese, or swine, his unrighteousness exceeds that of entering another’s garden to steal peaches and plums. Why is this? Because he harms others all the more, his lack of humaneness grows ever greater, and his crime becomes all the more grave. When it comes to entering another’s stable and pen to take their horses and cattle, his lack of humaneness and righteousness exceeds that of seizing another’s dogs, pigs, geese, or swine. Why is this? Because he harms others all the more; if he harms others all the more, his lack of humaneness grows ever greater, and his crime becomes all the more grave. When it comes to killing an innocent person, stripping them of their robes and furs, and taking their halberds and swords, his unrighteousness exceeds that of entering another’s stable and pen to take their horses and cattle. Why is this? Because he harms others all the more; if he harms others all the more, his lack of humaneness grows ever greater, and his crime becomes all the more grave. In such cases, the rulers of the world all know to condemn it, calling it unrighteous. Yet when it comes to the great act of attacking a state, they do not know to condemn it; instead, they follow and praise it, calling it righteous. How can this be said to distinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness?\n\nKilling one person is called unrighteous, and it necessarily incurs a death penalty. If we apply this reasoning further, killing ten people is tenfold unrighteousness, and it necessarily incurs ten death penalties. Killing a hundred people is a hundredfold unrighteousness, and it necessarily incurs a hundred death penalties. In such cases, the noble persons of the world all know to condemn it, calling it unrighteous. Yet when it comes to the great unrighteousness of attacking a state, they do not condemn it; instead, they follow and praise it, calling it righteous. Truly, they do not recognize its unrighteousness. Thus, they record their words to bequeath to later generations. If they knew it was unrighteous, why would they record its unrighteousness to bequeath to later generations?\n\nNow, suppose there is a man who, having seen little black, calls it black, but having seen much black, calls it white—one would say this man does not know the distinction between white and black. Or suppose one who, having tasted little bitterness, calls it bitter, but having tasted much bitterness, calls it sweet—one would surely say this man does not know the distinction between sweet and bitter. Now, when it comes to minor wrongs, they know to condemn them. But when it comes to the great wrong of attacking a state, they do not know to condemn it; instead, they follow and praise it, calling it righteous. Can this be said to know the distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness? Thus, we know that the noble persons of the world are confused about the distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness.\n\n*Condemning Offensive Warfare, Part Two*\n\nMaster Mozi said: In ancient times, when kings, dukes, and great ministers governed the state, they truly desired to scrutinize praise and blame, ensure proper rewards and punishments, and prevent errors in criminal administration. Therefore, Master Mozi said: In ancient times, there was a saying: \"If planning does not succeed, then use the past to know the future, use the visible to know the hidden. If planning is like this, it can be known.\" Now, when troops are mobilized, marching in winter, they fear the cold; marching in summer, they fear the heat—this cannot be done in both winter and summer. In spring, it disrupts the people’s plowing, planting, and cultivation; in autumn, it disrupts the people’s harvesting and gathering. If even one season is disrupted, the number of common people who die from hunger, cold, and starvation will be beyond counting.\n\nNow, let us calculate the military supplies: bamboo arrows, feathered banners, tents, armor, shields, and spears—those that are worn out, broken, and unusable are beyond counting. Add to this spears, halberds, dagger-axes, swords, and war chariots—those that are shattered, broken, and unusable are beyond counting. Add to this the oxen and horses that depart well-fed but return emaciated, or depart and die without returning—their number is beyond counting. Add to this the long and distant roads, where provisions are cut off and rain does not follow, and the number of common people who die is beyond counting. Add to this the lack of stable dwellings, untimely meals, and irregular hunger and fullness, and the number of common people who fall ill and die on the road is beyond counting. The loss of armies is beyond counting; the complete annihilation of armies is beyond calculation. Thus, the number of ghosts and spirits who lose their descendants is also beyond counting.\n\nThe state enacts policies that deprive the people of their strength and abolish their benefits to an extreme degree. Yet why do they do this? They say: \"I covet the fame of victory in attack and the benefits to be gained, so I do this.\" Master Mozi said: If we calculate what is gained by victory, it is of no use. If we calculate what is obtained, it does not compare to what is lost. Now, attacking a city of three *li* and an outer wall of seven *li*—if this can be done without sharp weapons, without killing, and merely by seizing it, then so be it. But killing many must number in the tens of thousands, and killing few must number in the thousands, before a city of three *li* and an outer wall of seven *li* can be taken.\n\nNow, a state of ten thousand chariots may empty its numbers by the thousands without victory and retreat; its vast territory may number in the tens of thousands without victory and be abandoned. Thus, land is what they have in excess, while people are what they lack. Now, to exhaust the deaths of the people, to intensify the suffering of high and low, and to contend for empty cities—this is to discard what they lack and further what they have in excess. Governing in this way is not the proper task of the state.\n\nThose who embellish offensive warfare say: \"To the south, they carved out the kings of Wu; to the north, they subdued the lords of Qi and Jin. When they were first enfeoffed in the world, the extent of their lands did not reach several hundred *li*, and the multitude of their people did not reach several hundred thousand. Because of offensive warfare, the breadth of their lands reached several thousand *li*, and the multitude of their people reached several million. Thus, offensive warfare cannot be abandoned.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: Even if four or five states gain profit from it, it is still called not following the Dao. It is like a physician’s medicine for those who are ill. Now, suppose there is a physician who mixes his medicinal incantations for all the ill in the world and administers medicine to them. If ten thousand people take this medicine, and only four or five benefit from it, it would still be called not practicing medicine properly.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the filial son does not feed his parents through such means, nor does the loyal minister feed his lord. In ancient times, when states were enfeoffed throughout the world, those of earlier times knew through what their ears had heard, and those of later times saw with their own eyes—those destroyed by offensive warfare were beyond counting.\n\nHow do we know this to be so? In the east, there was the state of Ju, small in size, which, though situated between great states, failed to respectfully serve them. Those great states, in turn, did not follow Ju’s lead nor seek its benefit. As a result, the Yue people to the east encroached upon and diminished its territory, while the Qi people to the west annexed and took possession of it. The reason Ju perished between Qi and Yue was precisely offensive warfare. Though in the south, Chen and Cai likewise perished between Wu and Yue for the same reason. Though in the north, states like Juyi and Buzhuohe perished between Yan, Dai, the Hu, and the Mo—again, because of offensive warfare.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: In ancient times, the lords and great men desired gain and detested loss, sought security and shunned danger. Thus, offensive warfare cannot but be condemned. Those who embellish the words of offensive warfare say: \"They could not rally and employ their multitudes, and so perished. I can rally and employ my multitudes—who in the world would dare not submit to me?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: Even if you can rally and employ your multitudes, how do you compare to King Helü of Wu in ancient times? King Helü of Wu trained for seven years, donning armor and wielding weapons, marching three hundred *li* before making camp. He passed through Zhulin, emerged from the perilous paths of Ming’ai, and fought at Baihu, cutting through the heart of Chu to receive the homage of Song and Lu. By the time of King Fuchai, he again attacked Qi, encamping at Wenshang and battling at Ailing, where he crushed the Qi forces and entrenched them at Mount Tai. Turning east to attack Yue, he crossed the Three Rivers and Five Lakes, entrenching them at Kuaiji. The nine Yi states all submitted without exception. Yet afterward, he failed to reward the orphaned, bestow alms upon the common folk, or rely on his own strength. Instead, he boasted of his achievements, praised his own wisdom, neglected his teachings, and proceeded to build the Terrace of Gusu, which remained unfinished after seven years. In this way, Wu fostered discontent and weariness. When King Goujian of Yue saw that the upper and lower ranks of Wu were at odds, he rallied his forces to renew his campaigns. Entering the northern suburbs, relocating the great inner palace, and besieging the royal palace, he brought about the destruction of Wu.\n\nIn former times, Jin had six generals, among whom Zhibo was the strongest. Calculating the breadth of his lands and the multitude of his people, he sought to resist the feudal lords, aspiring to the swift renown of offensive warfare. Thus, he meticulously selected his crack troops, arrayed his chariots and soldiers, and attacked the Zhonghang clan, seizing their lands. Confident in his schemes, he then attacked the Fan clan and utterly defeated them. Having merged three clans into one, he did not stop there but laid siege to Zhao Xiangzi at Jinchang. At this point, Han and Wei conferred, saying: \"As the ancient saying goes, 'When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold.' If Zhao perishes in the morning, we shall follow by evening. If Zhao perishes in the evening, we shall follow by morning.\" The *Book of Songs* says: \"If the fish and water do not unite, what will become of them on land?\" Thus, the three lords united their hearts and strength, opened the gates and cleared the roads, donned armor and roused their troops. Han and Wei attacked from without, Zhao from within, and together they struck Zhibo, crushing him utterly.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: There is an ancient saying: \"The noble man does not use water as a mirror but uses men. A mirror of water shows only the face’s appearance; a mirror of men reveals fortune and misfortune.\" If you consider offensive warfare profitable, have you not reflected on the affair of Zhibo? That it brings misfortune rather than fortune can already be known.\n\n*Against Offensive Warfare, Part Three*\n\nMaster Mozi said: What is the explanation for the world’s praise of goodness today? Is it because such actions align with the benefit of Heaven above, the spirits in the middle, and the people below, and thus are praised? Or is it not for these reasons that they are praised? Even the most foolish among the people would say: It is because such actions align with the benefit of Heaven above, the spirits in the middle, and the people below that they are praised.\n\nToday, what the world universally upholds are the laws of the sage-kings. Yet if the feudal lords of the world continue to engage in offensive warfare and annexation, they merely possess the name of praising righteousness without examining its reality. This is like a blind man who, when asked to distinguish between white and black, cannot discern the objects—how can he be said to truly know the difference?\n\nThus, the wise of ancient times, in planning for the world, necessarily considered the rightness of an action before proceeding. Only then did they act without hesitation, swiftly achieving success, attaining their desires, and aligning with the benefit of Heaven, the spirits, and the people. This is the way of the wise.\n\nTherefore, the benevolent rulers of antiquity who held the world necessarily reversed the doctrines of great states, unified the harmony of the world, and gathered all within the four seas. They led the people of the world to serve the Lord on High, the mountains and rivers, and the spirits with the labor of farming. Their benefit to the people was great, and their achievements were vast. Thus, Heaven rewarded them, the spirits enriched them, and the people praised them, making them noble as the Son of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven, their names joining Heaven and Earth, enduring to this day without fading. This is the way of the wise, the means by which the former kings held the world.\n\nYet the lords and great men, the feudal lords of the world today, act otherwise. They meticulously select their crack troops, array their chariots and soldiers, forge sturdy armor and sharp weapons, and proceed to attack and invade blameless states.",

      "translated_text": "Upon breaching the borders of a state, they reap its crops, fell its trees, raze its walls and ramparts to fill its moats and ditches, slaughter its sacrificial livestock, and demolish its ancestral temples. They ruthlessly kill its people, trample its elderly and weak, and carry off its treasures. When the troops advance, they are exhorted at the clamor of battle: \"To die in service is supreme; to kill many is next; to be wounded is the least.\" How much worse, then, is it to be the first to flee in defeat? Such a crime is punishable by death without mercy! This is how they rally their forces.\n\nYet to annex states and annihilate armies, to ravage the people and disrupt the legacy of the sages—can this truly be deemed beneficial to Heaven? To seize the people of Heaven and attack the cities of Heaven is to slaughter the people of Heaven, desecrate the abodes of the spirits, overthrow the altars of the soil and grain, and slaughter the sacrificial victims. This is surely not in accord with Heaven’s benefit. Can it be deemed beneficial to the spirits? To kill their worshippers, extinguish the lords of the spirits, abolish the former kings, and ravage the people—causing the common folk to scatter—this is surely not in accord with the spirits’ benefit. Can it be deemed beneficial to the people? To kill them for the sake of profit is already excessive. Moreover, when one calculates the costs, this exhausts the very foundation of life, depleting the resources of the people under Heaven beyond measure. Thus, it is surely not in accord with the people’s benefit.\n\nNow, those who lead armies speak of the many ways such actions bring no advantage: the general lacks courage, the officers are undisciplined, the weapons are dull, the troops are untrained, the army is too small, the soldiers are disunited, their might is insufficient, their harms are not enduring, their struggles are not swift, their defenses are not strong, their resolve is not firm, and the feudal lords of allied states are doubtful. When allied lords are doubtful, the enemy’s plans take shape, and their intentions grow weak. If one proceeds with such deficiencies, the state loses its troops, and the people abandon their labors.\n\nNow, observe the states that delight in attack and conquest: when they mobilize their forces, nobles and commoners alike must number in the thousands, with conscripts and laborers reaching the hundreds of thousands, before they can set their armies in motion. Such campaigns may last years or, at best, months. During this time, the ruler has no leisure to attend to governance, officials cannot manage their offices, farmers cannot tend their fields, and women cannot spin or weave. Thus, the state loses its troops, and the people abandon their labors.\n\nMoreover, their chariots and horses are worn out, their tents and canopies, the supplies of the three armies, and the provisions for armor and weapons—even if only one-fifth remain, it is still insufficient. Then there are those who perish along the roads: the routes are long, provisions cannot keep pace, and when the time comes to eat and drink, the laborers suffer from hunger, cold, exhaustion, illness, and disease, dying in droves in the ditches. The harm this inflicts upon the people is profound, a grave calamity for all under Heaven. Yet the lords and great men delight in such actions—this is to take pleasure in the destruction of the people of the world. Is this not perverse?\n\nNow, among the warlike states of the world—Qi, Jin, Chu, and Yue—if these four were to have their way, their populations would increase tenfold, yet they would still be unable to fill their lands. This is a case of too few people and too much land. Yet they continue to fight over territory, thereby diminishing what is already insufficient while further increasing what is already in excess.\n\nNow, the lords who delight in attack and conquest further embellish their arguments to refute Mozi, saying: \"Is not the use of force to punish unrighteousness beneficial?\" In ancient times, Yu campaigned against the Three Miao, Tang overthrew Jie, and King Wu defeated Zhou—all were established as sage-kings. Why is this so? Mozi replied: \"You have not examined the nature of my words or understood their meaning. What they did was not called 'attack' but 'punishment.'\"\n\nIn the time of the Three Miao, great chaos arose. Heaven’s decree was upon them: omens appeared, blood rained for three days, dragons emerged in the temples, wailing filled the markets, the earth split to the springs, and the five grains mutated, causing the people great distress. Gaoyang then commanded the Dark Palace, and Yu personally grasped Heaven’s auspicious mandate to campaign against the Three Miao. Lightning and thunder guided the way; a spirit with the face of a man and the body of a crow, bearing jade-like tokens, attended him. Yi loosed arrows at the Miao’s omens, and the Miao’s forces fell into chaos, soon to be subdued. After Yu had conquered the Three Miao, he demarcated the mountains and rivers, distinguished the ranks of beings, established the great norms, and ensured that spirits and people did not transgress. The world was then at peace—this was Yu’s punishment of the Three Miao.\n\nAs for Jie of Xia, Heaven’s mandate was withdrawn: the sun and moon were untimely, cold and heat arrived in disorder, the five grains withered and died, ghosts wailed in the state, and cranes cried for over ten nights. Heaven then commanded Tang at the Biao Palace, entrusting him with Xia’s great mandate: \"The virtue of Xia is in great disorder. I have already ended its mandate from Heaven. Go and punish it, and you shall surely be capable.\" Tang dared to lead his forces to the borders of Xia, where the Lord on High sent dark forces to destroy Xia’s cities. Soon after, a spirit came to announce: \"The virtue of Xia is in great disorder. Go and attack it, and I shall surely make you capable.\" Having received the mandate from Heaven, Heaven sent a blazing fire to the northwest corner of Xia’s cities. Tang, leading Jie’s forces, conquered Xia, assembled the feudal lords at Bo, presented the decree of Heaven, and proclaimed it to the four quarters. The feudal lords of the world dared not but submit—this was Tang’s punishment of Jie.\n\nAs for King Zhou of Shang, Heaven did not order his virtue: the sacrifices were untimely, and for ten nights, the sun and moon rained down upon Bo. The Nine Tripods shifted, women took on ominous appearances, ghosts wailed at night, women became men, Heaven rained flesh, thorns grew on the roads, and the king’s elder brother indulged himself without restraint.",

They meticulously select their crack troops, array their chariots and soldiers, forge sturdy armor and sharp weapons, and proceed to attack and invade blameless states.",

      "translated_text": "A red crow bearing a jade tablet descended upon the altar of Qi in Zhou, proclaiming: \"Heaven commands King Wen of Zhou to punish Yin and take possession of the realm.\" Taidian came to submit, the Yellow River yielded the Green Chart, and the earth produced the divine steed Huang. King Wu fulfilled his merit, dreaming of three spirits who declared: \"I have already drowned Zhou of Yin in the virtue of wine. Go and attack him, and I shall surely make you greatly capable.\" King Wu then struck down the madman, overthrowing Shang to establish Zhou, and Heaven bestowed upon him the banner of the yellow crow. Having conquered Yin, the king completed the work of the August Emperor, apportioning sacrifices to the various spirits, honoring the former kings of Yin, and extending his reach to the four barbarians. Thus, none under Heaven dared not submit, and he inherited Tang’s legacy—this was King Wu’s punishment of Zhou.\n\nViewing these three sage-kings, it was not called \"attack\" but \"punishment.\" Yet rulers who delight in aggression embellish their arguments to refute Mozi, saying: \"Do you consider attack and conquest unrighteous? Do they not benefit the world?\" In ancient times, Chu’s Xiong Li first campaigned in the region of Mount Sui, King Goujian of Yue emerged from Youju to found his state, Tang Shu and Lü Shang established Qi and Jin. Each of these began with territories of only a few hundred *li*, yet through the annexation of states, they came to rule a quarter of the world. How is this so?\n\nMozi replied: \"You have not examined the categories of my words nor understood their reasons. In antiquity, when the Son of Heaven first enfeoffed the feudal lords, there were over ten thousand. Now, through the annexation of states, over ten thousand have been destroyed, leaving only four standing. This is like a physician whose medicine cures only four out of ten thousand—he cannot be called a good doctor.\" Such rulers further adorn their claims, saying: \"It is not that I lack gold, jade, women, or land. I seek to establish a righteous name under Heaven and attract the feudal lords through virtue.\"\n\nMozi said: \"If one could truly establish a righteous name under Heaven and attract the feudal lords through virtue, the submission of the world could be awaited in an instant. Yet the world has long been mired in aggression, like a colt broken to the saddle. If one could demonstrate trustworthiness and prioritize the benefit of the feudal lords, then when a great state acts unjustly, all would share its sorrow; when it attacks a small state, all would come to its rescue. If a small state’s walls are incomplete, they would be repaired; if its grain stores are exhausted, they would be replenished; if its silk and cloth are insufficient, they would be supplied. By thus demonstrating to great states, the rulers of small states would rejoice. If others toil while we rest, our armor and weapons grow strong. With generosity and relief in times of urgency, the people will surely turn to us. By replacing aggression with governance, our attacks will be twice as effective. Calculating the cost of our campaigns and exposing the exhaustion of the feudal lords, we may surely secure order and advantage. Supervising with rectitude and justifying our name, we must strive to be lenient with our people and trustworthy with our troops. By thus instructing the armies of the feudal lords, we would be invincible under Heaven, and our benefits to the world would be beyond count. This is the true benefit of the world, yet if kings, dukes, and great officials remain unaware and persist in such practices, they may be called ministers who know not how to benefit the world.\"\n\nThus, Mozi declared: \"Now, if the kings, dukes, gentlemen, and officers of the world truly desire to seek the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm, they must recognize that the incessant practice of aggression is indeed the greatest harm under Heaven. If one wishes to practice benevolence and righteousness, to strive for the rank of superior scholar, to follow the Way of the sage-kings above and seek the benefit of states and common people below, then one must uphold the doctrine of *non-aggression*—this is what cannot be left unexamined.\" *Mozi, Scroll Five ends.

      "translated_text": "**Moderation in Expenditure, Part One (Chapter Twenty)**\n\nWhen the sage governs a single state, the state’s resources may be doubled. When he governs the entire world, the world’s resources may be doubled. This doubling is not achieved by seizing land from without, but by taking the existing state and removing what is superfluous—thus doubling its wealth.\n\nWhen the sage-king governs, every decree he issues and every affair he initiates, every convenience for the people and every expenditure of wealth, is done without waste. Therefore, wealth is not squandered, the people are not overburdened, and the benefits they receive are manifold.\n\nWhat is the purpose of clothing and furs? In winter, they ward off the cold; in summer, they shield from the heat. The principle of making garments is this: if they provide added warmth in winter or added coolness in summer, they are retained. If they do not, they are discarded.\n\nWhat is the purpose of palaces and dwellings? In winter, they block wind and cold; in summer, they shelter from heat and rain. If they provide added security against thieves and bandits, they are retained. If they do not, they are discarded.\n\nWhat is the purpose of armor, shields, and the five weapons? To defend against raiders, rebels, and bandits. When raiders, rebels, and bandits arise, those with armor, shields, and the five weapons prevail, while those without are defeated. Thus, the sage creates armor, shields, and the five weapons. The principle of making them is this: if they are lighter, more durable, and harder to break, they are retained. If they are not, they are discarded.\n\nWhat is the purpose of boats and carts? Carts travel over hills and land, boats traverse rivers and valleys, connecting the benefits of the four directions. The principle of making boats and carts is this: if they are lighter and more efficient, they are retained. If they are not, they are discarded.\n\nIn all these things, nothing is made without purpose. Therefore, wealth is not squandered, the people are not overburdened, and the benefits they receive are manifold.\n\nIf we eliminate the extravagant preferences of great men—amassing pearls, jades, exotic birds, beasts, dogs, and horses—and instead increase the quantity of clothing, dwellings, armor, shields, the five weapons, boats, and carts, would this not multiply their number severalfold? Such a task is not difficult. What, then, is truly difficult? Only the doubling of the population is difficult. Yet even the population can be doubled.\n\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings established this law: a man at twenty years of age must not fail to establish a household; a woman at fifteen must not fail to serve a husband. This was the law of the sage-kings. After the sage-kings passed, the people followed a different standard. Those who wished to marry early did so at twenty; those who wished to marry late did so at forty. Comparing the early and late, this lagged ten years behind the sage-kings’ law. If a woman bears a child every three years, she may have two or three children in that time. Would this not allow the people to marry earlier and thus double the population? Indeed, it would.",

      "translated_text": "Now, those who govern the world today employ many methods that diminish the people. They impose heavy labor upon the people, levy exorbitant taxes, and leave the people’s resources insufficient—so many freeze or starve to death that they cannot be counted. Moreover, the rulers dispatch armies to invade neighboring states: some campaigns last a full year, others mere months, keeping men and women apart for long stretches. This is one of the ways they diminish the people. Others die from unstable living conditions, irregular meals, or illness brought on by toil; still more perish in raids, ambushes, assaults on cities, or battles in the wild—so many that they cannot be counted. Are these not the very policies by which those who govern today multiply the means of diminishing the people?\n\nWhen the sages governed, they did not resort to such measures. When those who are not sages govern, do they not multiply the ways of harming the people? Thus Master Mo declared: “Abandon the useless—this is the great benefit of the sage-kings’ Way for all under Heaven.”\n\n**Moderation in Use, Part Two**\n\nMaster Mo said: In ancient times, the enlightened kings and sages who ruled all under Heaven and governed the feudal lords did so because they cherished the people with utmost care, served them with unwavering loyalty, and brought them benefit with the greatest generosity. Their loyalty and trust were interwoven, and they continually demonstrated what was advantageous—thus the people never wearied of them throughout their lives, nor did their influence wane even twenty years after their passing. This is how the enlightened kings and sages of old ruled all under Heaven and governed the feudal lords.\n\nTherefore, the sage-kings of antiquity established laws for moderation in use, decreeing: Let all the hundred artisans under Heaven—those who transport goods, build carts, weave mats, craft pottery, forge metal, fell timber, or work as carpenters—each devote themselves to their respective crafts. The rule was: Whatever suffices to supply the people’s needs, any additional expense that does not further benefit the people must cease.\n\nThe sage-kings also established laws for food and drink, decreeing: Let it suffice to fill the void, sustain the qi, strengthen the limbs, and sharpen the ears and eyes—then stop. Do not pursue the utmost refinement of the five flavors or the perfect harmony of fragrances; do not seek rare delicacies or exotic goods from distant lands. How do we know this to be so?",

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he soothed the lands of Jiao to the south and descended upon Youdu in the north; from east to west, wherever the sun rose and set, none failed to submit in homage, establishing a profound love. Millet and sorghum were not doubled, and broths were not layered. They drank from earthen mounds and sipped from clay vessels, ladling with gourds. Bowing, rising, and turning in ceremonial decorum—such rites the sage-kings did not observe.\n\nThe sage-kings of old established laws for clothing, decreeing: In winter, wear garments of felted red, light yet warm; in summer, wear garments of fine linen, light yet cool—then stop. Any expense that does not further benefit the people, the sage-kings did not undertake.\n\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings, seeing that fierce birds, cunning beasts, and violent men harmed the people, thereupon taught the people to bear arms. They wore swords daily: for stabbing, they pierced; for striking, they severed; even when struck from the side, they did not break—such was the advantage of the sword. Armor as clothing was light and effective; when in motion, weapons followed—such was the advantage of armor. Chariots served to carry heavy loads and reach distant places; riding them brought safety, pulling them brought ease. Safe, they did not harm people; swift, they hastened arrival—such was the advantage of the chariot.\n\nWhen the sage-kings saw that great rivers and broad valleys could not be crossed, they devised boats and oars, sufficient for passage—then stopped. Even when the Three Dukes and feudal lords arrived, boats and oars were not altered, and ferrymen did not adorn themselves—such was the advantage of boats.\n\nThe sage-kings established laws for frugal burials, decreeing: Three garments suffice to rot the flesh; a coffin three inches thick suffices to rot the bones. Dig the grave deep enough not to reach the springs, ensuring no leakage—then stop. Once the dead are buried, the living should not mourn for long with grief.\n\nIn ancient times, when humans first came into being, there were no palaces or houses, so they dwelled in caves dug into hills and mounds. The sage-kings considered this and thought: Though digging caves may shield from wind and cold in winter, in summer, the lower parts grow damp, the upper parts heavy with moisture, fearing harm to the people’s qi. Thus, they constructed palaces and houses for benefit.\n\nWhat, then, were the principles for building palaces and houses? Master Mozi said: Let their sides block wind and cold, their tops shield from snow, frost, rain, and dew; let their interiors be clean and bright for sacrifices; let their walls suffice to separate men and women—then stop. Any expense that does not further benefit the people, the sage-kings did not undertake.\n\n*[Sections omitted: \"Moderation in Use, Part Two\" (22), \"Frugal Burial, Part One\" (23), \"Frugal Burial, Part Two\" (24), \"Frugal Burial, Part Three\" (25)]*\n\nMaster Mozi said: The benevolent, in their planning for the world, differ not from the filial child planning for their parents. How does the filial child plan for their parents? They say: If the parents are poor, they strive to enrich them; if the people are few, they strive to increase them; if the multitude is chaotic, they strive to govern them. When faced with these tasks, if their strength is insufficient, their resources inadequate, or their wisdom lacking, only then do they desist. They dare not withhold their remaining strength, conceal their plans, or leave benefits unexploited without doing all they can for their parents. Such are the three duties in the filial child’s planning for their parents.\n\nEven the benevolent’s planning for the world follows this same pattern. They say: If the world is poor, strive to enrich it; if the people are few, strive to increase them; if the multitude is chaotic, strive to govern it. When faced with these tasks, if their strength is insufficient, their resources inadequate, or their wisdom lacking, only then do they desist. They dare not withhold their remaining strength, conceal their plans, or leave benefits unexploited without doing all they can for the world. Such are the three duties in the benevolent’s planning for the world.\n\nNow, since the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties passed away, the world has lost its righteousness. Later generations of noble men have debated: Some regard lavish burials and prolonged mourning as benevolence, righteousness, and the duty of a filial child. Others regard them as neither benevolent nor righteous, nor the duty of a filial child. These two parties, though their words oppose each other and their actions contradict, both claim: \"We follow the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu.\" Yet their words oppose, and their actions contradict. Thus, later generations of noble men are all perplexed by the words of these two parties.\n\nIf one is indeed perplexed by the words of these two parties, then let us tentatively put them into practice in governing the state and the myriad people and observe: In calculating lavish burials and prolonged mourning, which of the three benefits—enriching the poor, increasing the few, or pacifying danger and governing chaos—do they truly serve? If, in my judgment, following their words and employing their plans, lavish burials and prolonged mourning can indeed enrich the poor, increase the few, pacify danger, and govern chaos, then this is benevolence, righteousness, and the duty of a filial child. Those who plan for others cannot but encourage it. The benevolent, seeking to promote this for the world, will make it so that the people praise it and never abandon it.\n\nBut if, in my judgment, following their words and employing their plans, lavish burials and prolonged mourning cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, pacify danger, or govern chaos, then this is neither benevolence nor righteousness, nor the duty of a filial child. Those who plan for others cannot but discourage it. The benevolent, seeking to promote this for the world, will make it so that the people praise it and never abandon it.\n\nOr if, following their words and employing their plans, lavish burials and prolonged mourning truly cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, pacify danger, or govern chaos, then this is neither benevolence nor righteousness, nor the duty of a filial child. Those who plan for others cannot but oppose it. The benevolent, seeking to eliminate this, will make it so that the world rejects it and people condemn it, never to be practiced again.\n\nMoreover, to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm—yet today, the disorder of the state and the people is unprecedented from ancient times to the present. How do we know this to be so? Now, the scholars and gentlemen of the world still largely doubt whether lavish burials and prolonged mourning are correct or incorrect, beneficial or harmful.",

Do not pursue the utmost refinement of the five flavors or the perfect harmony of fragrances; do not seek rare delicacies or exotic goods from distant lands. How do we know this to be so?",

      "translated_text": "Thus Master Mozi declared: Let us then examine this matter. Even if we do not adopt the words of those who advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning, yet when it comes to affairs of state, this much remains: among the kings, dukes, and great officials who suffer bereavement, the coffins and outer coffins must be layered thick, the burial deep, the mourning garments numerous, the embroidered patterns elaborate, and the tomb mounds vast. As for the deaths of ordinary gentlemen and commoners, they nearly exhaust their households. When feudal lords die, their treasuries are emptied, and then gold, jade, pearls, and precious stones are heaped upon the body, bound with cords and knots, while chariots and horses are interred in the grave pit. Moreover, they must furnish many canopies, tripods, drums, silken banners, ritual vessels, halberds, swords, feathered ornaments, and leather goods, burying them all with the dead. If they wish to satisfy their desire for human sacrifice, they say: when the Son of Heaven is buried, the many number in the hundreds, the few in the tens; when generals and great officials are buried, the many number in the tens, the few in the single digits.\n\nWhat then are the rules for observing mourning? They say: weeping and wailing without order, tears flowing as sackcloth and hemp hang heavy, dwelling in a mourning hut, sleeping on rough mats with a clod of earth for a pillow. They further compel one another to force themselves not to eat, feigning hunger, and to wear thin garments, feigning cold, so that their faces become gaunt and sallow, their complexions darkened and dull, their ears and eyes no longer sharp, their hands and feet no longer strong—rendering them useless. It is also said: the conduct of a superior man in mourning must be such that he can only rise with support and walk with a staff, thus enduring for three years.\n\nIf we follow such words and practice such ways, and kings, dukes, and great officials observe this, they will surely be unable to attend court early to manage the five offices and six ministries, clear wastelands, or fill granaries. If farmers observe this, they will surely be unable to go out early and return late to plow, sow, plant, and cultivate. If artisans observe this, they will surely be unable to repair boats and chariots or craft vessels and utensils. If women observe this, they will surely be unable to rise early and retire late to spin, weave, and dye.\n\nIn careful calculation, lavish burials amount to burying much accumulated wealth, while prolonged mourning amounts to long prohibitions on work. Wealth that has been amassed is buried away; those who might later produce are long forbidden to do so. To seek prosperity in this way is like forbidding plowing yet hoping for a harvest—there is no possible argument for attaining wealth. Thus, in seeking to enrich the household, it is already impossible. If one wishes to increase the population, can this be the way? The argument for that, too, is impossible.",

      "translated_text": "Should the governance of the state now be founded upon lavish burials and prolonged mourning, then when the ruler dies, mourning shall last three years; when father or mother dies, mourning shall last three years; when wife or eldest son dies, all five shall mourn for three years. Thereafter, uncles, brothers, illegitimate sons, clansmen, paternal aunts, sisters, nephews, and maternal uncles shall each observe mourning for a set number of months—thus emaciation and wasting shall surely be regulated. Faces shall become sunken and sallow, complexions darkened and soot-like, ears and eyes dull, hands and feet feeble, rendering one unfit for use.\n\nIt is further said: The superior man, in observing mourning, must lean upon others to rise and walk with a staff—thus shall he endure for three years. Should such laws and words be followed as the Way, then hunger and privation shall be as this. Hence, in winter the people shall not withstand the cold, in summer they shall not endure the heat, and those who fall ill and die shall be beyond counting. This greatly disrupts the union of men and women, and in seeking to increase the population, it is like ordering a man to bear a sword while hoping for his longevity—there is no possible argument for attaining a multitude. Thus, in seeking to multiply the people, it is already impossible.\n\nDoes one wish to govern with penal laws? Can this be the way? The argument for that, too, is impossible. Should the governance of the state now be founded upon lavish burials and prolonged mourning, the nation shall surely grow poor, the people few, and penal governance chaotic. Should such laws and words be followed as the Way, those above shall be unable to attend to governance, and those below shall be unable to engage in work. If those above cannot attend to governance, penal laws shall surely be in disorder; if those below cannot engage in work, clothing and food shall surely be insufficient. Should they be insufficient, younger brothers seeking their elder brothers shall not find them, and the undutiful shall surely resent their elder brothers; sons seeking their parents shall not find them, and the unfilial shall surely resent their parents; ministers seeking their ruler shall not find him, and the disloyal shall surely rebel against their superiors.\n\nThus, the people of perverse and licentious conduct shall go forth without clothing and return without food. Within, they shall lack sustenance, and together they shall turn to wanton violence, becoming impossible to restrain. Hence, thieves and bandits shall multiply while those who govern shall be few. To first multiply thieves and bandits and then seek order is like ordering a man to bear three burdens at dawn and forbidding him to falter—there is no possible argument for attaining governance. Thus, in seeking to govern with penal laws, it is already impossible.\n\nDoes one wish to prevent great states from attacking small states? Can this be the way? The argument for that, too, is impossible. Thus, in former times, when the sage-kings had passed, the world lost its righteousness, and the feudal lords waged war by force. In the south were the kings of Chu and Yue, and in the north the lords of Qi and Jin—all honed their troops to attack, conquer, and govern the world through annexation. Therefore, the reason great states do not attack small states is that the latter possess abundant stores, well-maintained walls and moats, and harmony between ruler and subject—thus great states do not delight in attacking them. Without stores, with walls and moats unmaintained, and without harmony between ruler and subject, great states shall surely attack them.\n\nShould the governance of the state now be founded upon lavish burials and prolonged mourning, the nation shall surely grow poor, the people few, and penal governance chaotic. Should it be poor, there shall be no stores. Should the people be few, those to maintain walls and moats shall be few.

Such were the laws of the sage-kings.\n\nYet those who advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning say: \"Though lavish burials and prolonged mourning may not enrich the poor, increase the few, stabilize the perilous, or order the chaotic, they are the Way of the sage-kings.\" Master Mozi said: Not so.\n\nOf old, Yao taught the Eight Di in the north. When he died on the road, he was buried on the northern slope of Mount Yao. He was clothed in three garments of mourning, and his coffin was made of wood from the valley. It was bound with kudzu, and after the peach-wood bier was set down, they wailed. The grave mound was unsealed, level with the ground. After the burial, oxen and horses trampled over it.\n\nShun taught the Seven Rong in the west. When he died on the road, he was buried in the marketplace of Nanshi. He was clothed in three garments of mourning, and his coffin was made of wood from the valley, bound with kudzu. After the burial, the people of the marketplace trampled over it.\n\nYu taught the Nine Yi in the east. When he died on the road, he was buried on Mount Kuaiji. He was clothed in three garments of mourning, and his coffin was made of paulownia wood, three inches thick. It was bound with kudzu, the joints unsealed, the seams uncaulked. The grave was dug neither so deep as to reach the springs below nor so shallow as to allow the stench to rise above. After the burial, the remaining earth was gathered atop it, and the grave mound resembled a field plowed three times—no more.\n\nIf we observe these three sage-kings, then lavish burials and prolonged mourning are indeed not the Way of the sage-kings. These three kings were all exalted as Sons of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven. Did they worry that their resources were insufficient? They established such laws for burial.\n\nYet today, the kings, dukes, and great men conduct burials differently. They must have an outer coffin and an inner coffin, three layers of leather curtains, jade disks and ornaments in full array, halberds, swords, tripods, drums, jars, and basins, embroidered silks and plain weaves, ten thousand mourning garments, carriages, horses, and female musicians—all prepared. The grave mound must be as grand as a mountain. This halts the people’s work and squanders their wealth beyond measure. Such practices are utterly useless.\n\nThus, Master Mozi said: Formerly, I began by saying: If one adopts their words, employs their plans, and calculates that lavish burials and prolonged mourning can enrich the poor, increase the few, stabilize the perilous, and order the chaotic, then it is benevolent, righteous, and the duty of a filial son. One who plans for others cannot but encourage it. But if one adopts their words, employs their plans, and finds that lavish burials and prolonged mourning truly cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, stabilize the perilous, or order the chaotic, then it is not benevolent, not righteous, and not the duty of a filial son. One who plans for others cannot but oppose it.\n\nThus, in seeking to enrich the nation, one achieves the very opposite—poverty. In seeking to increase the people, one achieves the very opposite—fewness. In seeking to order governance, one achieves the very opposite—chaos. In seeking to prevent great states from attacking small states, it is already impossible. In seeking the blessings of the Supreme Lord and the spirits, one incurs misfortune instead.\n\nExamining above, it contradicts the Way of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. Examining below, it aligns with the deeds of Jie, Zhou, You, and Li. From this perspective, lavish burials and prolonged mourning are not the Way of the sage-kings.\n\nYet those who advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning say: \"If lavish burials and prolonged mourning are indeed not the Way of the sage-kings, why do the gentlemen of the Central States persist in them without ceasing or choosing otherwise?\" Master Mozi said: This is what is called \"convenient to their habits and justified by their customs.\"\n\nOf old, in the state of Zhuomu to the east of Yue, when the eldest son was born, they dismembered and ate him, calling it \"beneficial to the younger brother.\" When the grandfather died, they carried the grandmother on their backs and abandoned her, saying: \"A ghost’s wife cannot dwell with us.\" The rulers above made this their governance, and the people below made it their custom. They persisted in it without ceasing or choosing otherwise. Is this truly the Way of benevolence and righteousness? This is what is called \"convenient to their habits and justified by their customs.\"\n\nTo the south of Chu, there was the state of the Yanren. When their kin died, they rotted the flesh and discarded it, then buried the bones, and only then were they deemed filial sons.\n\nTo the west of Qin, there was the state of Yibing. When their kin died, they gathered firewood and burned the body, the smoke rising upward, calling it \"ascending to the distant.\" Only then were they deemed filial sons. The rulers above made this their governance, and the people below made it their custom. They persisted in it without ceasing or choosing otherwise. Is this truly the Way of benevolence and righteousness? This is what is called \"convenient to their habits and justified by their customs.\"\n\nIf we observe these three states, their practices are indeed meager. If the gentlemen of the Central States observe them, their practices are indeed lavish. Compared to those, they are excessively lavish; compared to these, they are excessively meager. Thus, burial must have its proper measure.",

      "translated_text": "Master Mozi said: Now, the scholar-gentlemen of the world know the small but not the great. How do we know this? We know it from how they conduct themselves in their households. If one living in a household offends the head of the family, there are still neighboring households to flee to. Yet even then, relatives, brothers, and acquaintances will admonish one another, all saying: \"One must be vigilant! One must be cautious! How can one live in a household and offend the head of the family and still consider it acceptable?\" This is not only true for households—it is the same even for states. If one living in a state offends the ruler, there are still neighboring states to flee to. Yet even then, relatives, brothers, and acquaintances will admonish one another, all saying: \"One must be vigilant! One must be cautious! Who would live in a state, offend the ruler, and still consider it acceptable?\" In such cases, there are places to flee, and the warnings are already so grave. How much more severe should the warnings be when there is nowhere to flee?\n\nMoreover, there is a saying: \"Where can one hide in the light of day? Where can one flee if one offends?\" The answer is: nowhere to flee. For the heavens cannot be concealed in forests, valleys, or secluded gates where no one dwells—brightness will surely reveal all. Yet the scholar-gentlemen of the world suddenly forget to admonish one another regarding Heaven. This is how I know that the scholar-gentlemen of the world know the small but not the great.\n\nNow then, what does Heaven desire, and what does it detest? Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness. Thus, if we lead the people of the world to act in accordance with righteousness, we are doing what Heaven desires. If we do what Heaven desires, Heaven will also do what we desire. Now, what do we desire, and what do we detest? We desire blessings and prosperity and detest misfortune and calamity. Yet if we lead the people of the world into misfortune and calamity, how can we know that Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness?\n\nIt is said: Where there is righteousness, there is life; where there is no righteousness, there is death. Where there is righteousness, there is wealth; where there is no righteousness, there is poverty. Where there is righteousness, there is order; where there is no righteousness, there is chaos. Thus, Heaven desires life and detests death, desires wealth and detests poverty, desires order and detests chaos. This is how we know that Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness.\n\nFurthermore, righteousness is governance. Governance does not flow from below to above; it must flow from above to below. Thus, the common people exhaust their strength in service, yet before they can govern themselves, the officers govern them. The officers exhaust their strength in service, yet before they can govern themselves, the generals and ministers govern them. The generals and ministers exhaust their strength in service, yet before they can govern themselves, the Three Dukes and feudal lords govern them. The Three Dukes and feudal lords exhaust their strength in governance, yet before they can govern themselves, the Son of Heaven governs them. And before the Son of Heaven can govern himself, Heaven governs him. The Son of Heaven governs the Three Dukes, feudal lords, officers, and common people. The scholar-gentlemen of the world clearly understand that Heaven governs the Son of Heaven, yet the people of the world do not clearly understand this.\n\nThus, in ancient times, the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—wished to make clear to the people of the world that Heaven governs the Son of Heaven. Therefore, none failed to groom oxen and sheep, raise dogs and pigs, prepare pure grain and sweet wine, and offer sacrifices to the Supreme Lord and spirits, seeking blessings from Heaven. I have never heard of the people of the world seeking blessings from the Son of Heaven. This is how I know that Heaven governs the Son of Heaven.\n\nTherefore, the Son of Heaven is the most exalted and wealthiest in the world. Thus, those who desire wealth and exaltation must align with the will of Heaven and cannot but comply. Those who comply with the will of Heaven—practicing universal love and mutual benefit—will surely receive reward. Those who defy the will of Heaven—practicing mutual hatred and harm—will surely receive punishment.\n\nNow then, who has complied with the will of Heaven and received reward? Who has defied it and received punishment? Master Mozi said: The sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—complied with the will of Heaven and received reward. The tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—defied the will of Heaven and received punishment.\n\nNow, why did Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu receive reward? Master Mozi said: They served Heaven above, served the spirits in the middle, and loved the people below. Thus, the will of Heaven said: \"These are those whom I love—I love them universally. These are those whom I benefit—I benefit them universally.\" Those who love others do so broadly; those who benefit others do so deeply. Therefore, they were made noble as Sons of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven, and their legacy endured for ten thousand generations. Their goodness was proclaimed, spreading throughout the world, and to this day they are called sage-kings.\n\nNow, why did Jie, Zhou, You, and Li receive punishment? Master Mozi said: They reviled Heaven above, deceived the spirits in the middle, and despised the people below. Thus, the will of Heaven said: \"These are those whom I love—I detest them separately. These are those whom I benefit—I harm them mutually.\" Those who detest others do so broadly; those who harm others do so deeply. Therefore, they did not complete their allotted years, their dynasties were cut short, and to this day they are reviled as tyrannical kings.\n\nNow, how do we know that Heaven loves the people of the world? Because it illuminates them universally. How do we know it illuminates them universally? Because it possesses them universally. How do we know it possesses them universally? Because it nourishes them universally. How do we know it nourishes them universally? It is said: Within the four seas, all who eat grain—none fail to groom oxen and sheep, raise dogs and pigs, prepare pure grain and sweet wine, and offer sacrifices to the Supreme Lord and spirits.",

The wheelwright and carpenter hold their compass and square to measure the square and round of all under Heaven, saying: what conforms is right, what does not conform is wrong.\n\nNow, the books of the gentlemen and knights of the world cannot be fully recorded, their words cannot be fully counted. They persuade rulers above and persuade officials below, yet in matters of benevolence and righteousness, they are far indeed. How do I know this? I say: I have obtained the luminous standard of all under Heaven to measure them.\n\n**Heaven’s Will, Part Twenty-Seven**\nMaster Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who wish to practice benevolence and righteousness must not fail to examine the source of righteousness. Since one cannot but examine the source of righteousness, then from where does righteousness arise? Master Mozi says: Righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly; it must arise from the noble and wise. How do I know that righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly, but must arise from the noble and wise? I say: Righteousness is good governance. How do I know that righteousness is good governance? I say: When the world has righteousness, it is ordered; when it lacks righteousness, it is chaotic. Thus I know that righteousness is good governance. The foolish and lowly cannot govern the noble and wise; only after the noble and wise govern can they govern the foolish and lowly. This is how I know that righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly, but must arise from the noble and wise.\n\nThen who is noble? Who is wise? I say: Heaven is noble, Heaven is wise—nothing more. Thus righteousness indeed arises from Heaven.\n\nNow, the people of the world say: The Son of Heaven is nobler than the feudal lords, and the feudal lords are nobler than the great officials—this is clear and evident. Yet I do not know whether Heaven is nobler and wiser than the Son of Heaven. Master Mozi says: I know that Heaven is nobler and wiser than the Son of Heaven. How? When the Son of Heaven does good, Heaven can reward him. When the Son of Heaven is tyrannical, Heaven can punish him. When the Son of Heaven suffers illness or misfortune, he must fast, bathe, and purify himself, prepare pure grain and sweet wine, and offer sacrifices to Heaven and the spirits—then Heaven can remove his afflictions. Yet I do not know whether Heaven seeks blessings for the Son of Heaven. This is how I know that Heaven is nobler and wiser than the Son of Heaven, and it is not only this.\n\nI also know it from the way of the *Xun Tian Ming Bu Jie* in the books of the former kings, which says: \"The luminous and wise, great indeed, oversee the ruler and issue commands below.\" This speaks of Heaven’s nobility and wisdom over the Son of Heaven. Is there anyone else who is noble and wise besides Heaven? I say: Heaven is noble, Heaven is wise—nothing more. Thus righteousness indeed arises from Heaven.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who truly wish to honor the Dao and benefit the people, who seek to examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, must not fail to be cautious of Heaven’s will. Since one must be cautious of Heaven’s will, then what does Heaven desire and what does it detest? Master Mozi says: Heaven’s will does not desire great states to attack small states, or powerful families to disrupt humble families. It does not desire the strong to oppress the few, the cunning to scheme against the foolish, or the noble to despise the lowly—these are what Heaven does not desire. Beyond this, it desires that people use their strength to assist one another, use their Dao to teach one another, and share their wealth with one another. It also desires that rulers diligently listen to governance and that subjects diligently attend to their tasks. If rulers diligently listen to governance, the state will be well-ordered. If subjects diligently attend to their tasks, resources will be sufficient. If the state is well-ordered and resources are sufficient, then internally, there will be pure wine and sweet grain to offer sacrifices to Heaven and the spirits; externally, there will be jade rings and pearls to present to neighboring states. The grievances of feudal lords will not arise, and weapons will not be raised at the borders. Internally, there will be means to feed the hungry and rest the weary, to nourish the myriad people—then ruler and minister, above and below, will be kind and loyal; father and son, elder and younger brother, will be compassionate and filial.\n\nThus, only by clearly understanding and following Heaven’s will, and broadly implementing it throughout the world, will governance be well-ordered, the people harmonious, the state prosperous, and resources abundant. The hundred clans will all have warm clothes and full bellies, living in comfort without worry. Therefore, Master Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who truly wish to follow the Dao and benefit the people, who seek to examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, must not fail to be cautious of Heaven’s will.",

Now, do the feudal lords desire that their ministers, states, and myriad people bring harm upon one another within their four borders? Yet if one dwells in a great state and attacks small states, or dwells in a great house and disrupts small households, seeking thereby to gain rewards and praise, such things shall never be attained—punishments and penalties will surely come. The Heavenly realm’s possession of the world is no different in this regard. If one dwells in a great state and attacks small states, or dwells in a great capital and assaults lesser cities, seeking thereby to obtain blessings and emoluments from Heaven, such blessings and emoluments shall never be attained—calamities and misfortunes will surely come. Now, if one does what Heaven does not desire and fails to do what Heaven desires, then Heaven, too, shall not do what people desire but shall do what people do not desire.\n\nWhat is it that people do not desire? It is sickness, suffering, and misfortune. If one does not do what Heaven desires but does what Heaven does not desire, this is to lead the myriad people of the world into the midst of calamity and misfortune. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity clearly knew what Heaven and the spirits bless and what they abhor, and so they sought to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm. Therefore, Heaven’s cold and heat were moderated, the four seasons harmonized, yin and yang, rain and dew timely; the five grains ripened, the six livestock thrived, and illness, plague, pestilence, famine, and disaster did not arise.\n\nThus, Master Mozi says: Now, the gentlemen of the world who truly wish to follow the Way and benefit the people, who seek to examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, must not fail to be cautious of Heaven’s will.\n\nMoreover, in the world there are those who are deemed unbenevolent and inauspicious, such as sons who do not serve their fathers, younger brothers who do not serve their elder brothers, and ministers who do not serve their rulers. The gentlemen of the world call these inauspicious. Yet Heaven encompasses all under Heaven and loves them, nurturing the myriad things to benefit them—even to the tip of a hair—so that the people may obtain and enjoy these benefits. Can this be called otherwise? Yet they alone fail to repay Heaven and do not recognize this as unbenevolent and inauspicious. This is what I call the gentleman’s clarity in small matters but blindness in great ones.\n\nFurthermore, I know that Heaven’s love for the people is profound, for it has established the sun, moon, and stars to illuminate and guide them; ordained the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—to order and regulate them; sent down thunder, snow, frost, rain, and dew to make the five grains and hemp grow, enabling the people to obtain and profit from them; arrayed mountains, rivers, streams, and valleys to distribute the hundred affairs; and oversees the people’s good and evil, appointing kings, dukes, marquises, and earls to reward the worthy and punish the violent. It has provided metals, wood, birds, and beasts for the cultivation of the five grains and hemp, to serve as the people’s clothing and food. From antiquity to the present, this has never ceased.

Now, the Dao of Heaven embraces all under Heaven and loves them, nurturing the myriad things to benefit them—even to the finest hair’s tip—yet if it were not for Heaven’s work, the people could not obtain these benefits, and this would be deemed wrong. Yet they alone offer no repayment to Heaven and do not recognize this as unfilial and inauspicious. This is what I mean when I say that noble men perceive the small but fail to perceive the great.\n\nMoreover, my proof that Heaven loves the people deeply is not limited to this alone. It is said: “He who kills the innocent, Heaven bestows misfortune upon him.” Who are the innocent? They are the people. Who bestows misfortune? It is Heaven. If Heaven did not love the people deeply, why would it declare that those who kill the innocent will be visited with misfortune by Heaven? This is how I know that Heaven loves the people deeply.\n\nFurthermore, my proof that Heaven loves the people deeply is not limited to this alone. It is said: Those who love and benefit others, aligning with Heaven’s intent, receive Heaven’s rewards. Those who hate and harm others, defying Heaven’s intent, receive Heaven’s punishments. Who are those who love and benefit others, aligning with Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s rewards? They are the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties: Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. What did Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu practice? They practiced inclusiveness, not partiality. Inclusiveness means: a great state does not attack a small state, a great family does not disrupt a small family, the strong do not plunder the weak, the many do not oppress the few, the cunning do not deceive the simple, and the noble do not disdain the humble. Observing their deeds, they benefited Heaven above, spirits in the middle, and people below. With these threefold benefits, nothing was left unbenefited—this is called the virtue of Heaven. They gathered the finest reputations of all under Heaven and bestowed them upon these kings, saying: “This is benevolence, this is righteousness—loving and benefiting others, aligning with Heaven’s intent, and receiving Heaven’s rewards.” Not only this, but their deeds were inscribed on bamboo and silk, engraved on metal and stone, carved on plates and basins, and transmitted to later generations of descendants. What was the purpose? To record those who loved and benefited others, aligned with Heaven’s intent, and received Heaven’s rewards.\n\nThe *Huang Yi* states: “The Lord said to King Wen, ‘I cherish your luminous virtue. You do not raise your voice or change your countenance, nor do you alter the seasons with harsh measures. Unknowing and unperceiving, you follow the Lord’s principles.’” The Lord approved of his compliance with the law and principles, so He raised Yin to reward him, making him noble as the Son of Heaven, wealthy with all under Heaven, and his fame endures to this day. Thus, those who love and benefit others, aligning with Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s rewards, have left a lasting legacy.\n\nWho are those who hate and harm others, defying Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s punishments? They are the violent kings of the Three Dynasties: Jie, Zhou, You, and Li. What did Jie, Zhou, You, and Li practice? They practiced partiality, not inclusiveness. Partiality means: a great state attacks a small state, a great family disrupts a small family, the strong plunder the weak, the many oppress the few, the cunning deceive the simple, and the noble disdain the humble. Observing their deeds, they did not benefit Heaven above, spirits in the middle, or people below. With these threefold harms, nothing was left unharmed—this is called the bane of Heaven. They gathered the vilest reputations of all under Heaven and bestowed them upon these kings, saying: “This is not benevolence, not righteousness—hating and harming others, defying Heaven’s intent, and receiving Heaven’s punishments.” Not only this, but their deeds were also inscribed on bamboo and silk, engraved on metal and stone, carved on plates and basins, and transmitted to later generations of descendants. What was the purpose? To record those who hated and harmed others, defied Heaven’s intent, and received Heaven’s punishments.\n\nThe *Da Ming* states: “Zhou exceeded his proper bounds and dwelling, refusing to serve the Supreme Lord, abandoning the spirits of his ancestors and neglecting their sacrifices. He declared, ‘I have fate; there is no need for toil.’” Thus, Heaven also abandoned Zhou and did not protect him. That Heaven abandoned Zhou and did not protect him was because he defied Heaven’s intent. Thus, those who hate and harm others, defying Heaven’s intent and receiving Heaven’s punishments, are clearly known.\n\nTherefore, Master Mo’s understanding of Heaven is no different from a wheelwright’s compass or a carpenter’s square. Now, if a wheelwright holds his compass to measure the roundness or lack thereof in all under Heaven, he says: “What aligns with my compass is round; what does not align is not round.” Thus, roundness and lack thereof can both be known. Why is this? Because the standard for roundness is clear. Likewise, a carpenter holds his square to measure the squareness or lack thereof in all under Heaven, saying: “What aligns with my square is square; what does not align is not square.” Thus, squareness and lack thereof can both be known. Why is this? Because the standard for squareness is clear.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Master Mo’s grasp of Heaven’s intent serves above to measure the governance of the kings, dukes, and great ministers of the world, and below to gauge the literary pursuits and spoken discourses of the myriad people. Observe their conduct: that which aligns with Heaven’s intent is called virtuous conduct; that which defies Heaven’s intent is called unvirtuous and wrong. Observe their discourses: that which aligns with Heaven’s intent is called virtuous discourse; that which defies Heaven’s intent is called unvirtuous discourse. Observe their governance: that which aligns with Heaven’s intent is called virtuous governance; that which defies Heaven’s intent is called unvirtuous governance. Therefore, establish this as the standard, set this as the model, and use it to measure the benevolence or lack thereof in the kings, dukes, great ministers, and high officials of the world—it is as clear as distinguishing black from white.\n\nHence, Master Mo says: Now, if the kings, dukes, great ministers, and gentlemen of the world truly wish to follow the Dao to benefit the people and examine the root of benevolence and righteousness, they cannot but align with Heaven’s intent. Aligning with Heaven’s intent is the standard of righteousness.\n\n**Heaven’s Will, Part Twenty-Eight**\nMaster Mo said: What is the cause of the world’s chaos? It is that the gentlemen of the world are clear about minor matters but unclear about major ones. How do we know they are clear about minor matters but unclear about major ones? Because they are unclear about Heaven’s intent. How do we know they are unclear about Heaven’s intent? Consider how people conduct themselves in households. If one living in another’s household commits an offense, there are still other households to flee to for refuge. Yet fathers warn their sons, elder brothers warn their younger brothers, saying: “Be cautious, be prudent! Living in another’s household, if you are not cautious and prudent, how much more so when living in another’s state?” Now, if one living in another’s state commits an offense, there are still other states to flee to for refuge. Yet fathers warn their sons, elder brothers warn their younger brothers, saying: “Be cautious, be prudent! Living in another’s state, one cannot but be cautious and prudent.” Now, all people dwell in the world and serve Heaven. If they offend Heaven, there is nowhere to flee for refuge. Yet none know to admonish one another—this is how I know they are ignorant of great matters.\n\nThus, Master Mo says: Be cautious, be prudent! You must do what Heaven desires and abandon what Heaven detests. What does Heaven desire? What does it detest? Heaven desires righteousness and detests unrighteousness. How do we know this? Righteousness is correctness. How do we know righteousness is correctness? When the world has righteousness, it is ordered; without righteousness, it is chaotic. Thus, I know righteousness is correctness. Yet correctness does not arise from below to correct what is above; it must arise from above to correct what is below. Therefore, commoners cannot correct themselves without being ordered by scholars; scholars cannot correct themselves without being ordered by great officers; great officers cannot correct themselves without being ordered by feudal lords; feudal lords cannot correct themselves without being ordered by the Three Dukes; the Three Dukes cannot correct themselves without being ordered by the Son of Heaven; and the Son of Heaven cannot govern himself without being ordered by Heaven. Now, the gentlemen of the world all understand that the Son of Heaven corrects the world but do not understand that Heaven corrects the Son of Heaven.\n\nThus, the sages of old explained to people: If the Son of Heaven does good, Heaven can reward him. If the Son of Heaven commits wrongs, Heaven can punish him. If the Son of Heaven’s rewards and punishments are unjust or his judgments unfair, the world suffers from plagues, disasters, untimely frost, and dew. The Son of Heaven must then fast, rear pure oxen, sheep, and dogs, prepare refined grain offerings and sweet wine, and pray to Heaven for blessings. I have never heard of Heaven praying to the Son of Heaven for blessings—this is how I know Heaven is weightier and more venerable than the Son of Heaven. Therefore, righteousness does not arise from the foolish and lowly but must arise from the noble and wise. Who is wise? Heaven is wise. Thus, righteousness truly arises from Heaven.\n\nNow, if the gentlemen of the world wish to practice righteousness, they cannot but align with Heaven’s intent. What does aligning with Heaven’s intent entail? It entails universally loving the people of the world. How do we know it entails universally loving the people of the world? Because it entails universally nourishing them. How do we know it entails universally nourishing them? From ancient times to the present, there has been no distant or isolated land where people do not rear pure oxen, sheep, and dogs, prepare refined grain offerings and sweet wine, and reverently sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, mountains, rivers, and spirits—this is how I know they universally nourish them. If they universally nourish them, they must universally love them. It is like the rulers of Chu and Yue: if the King of Chu nourishes only those within his four borders, he loves only the people of Chu; but now Heaven nourishes the entire world, so I know it universally loves the people of the world.\n\nMoreover, Heaven’s love for the people does not stop at material things. Now, in the states of the world where people consume grain, killing an innocent person is deemed inauspicious. Who kills the innocent? People do. Who bestows innocence? Heaven does. If Heaven truly did not love these people, why would it deem killing the innocent inauspicious and bestow misfortune upon the killer? Indeed, Heaven’s love for the people is profound and distinct—this can be known. How do we know Heaven loves the people? I know it because the worthy invariably reward the good and punish the violent. How do we know the worthy invariably reward the good and punish the violent? I know it from the sagely kings of the Three Dynasties of old.",

Following this, they brought benefit to it, transforming the hearts of the people and leading them to revere the Supreme Lord, the mountains and rivers, and the ghosts and spirits. Heaven, seeing that they loved what it loved and benefited what it benefited, bestowed rewards upon them, placing them in high positions, establishing them as the Sons of Heaven to serve as models, and naming them \"sages.\" This serves as evidence of their rewarding the good.\n\nTherefore, the tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—universally harmed the world. Following this, they plundered it, corrupting the hearts of the people and leading them to revile and insult the Supreme Lord, the mountains and rivers, and the ghosts and spirits. Heaven, seeing that they did not love what it loved and harmed what it benefited, imposed punishments upon them, causing their fathers and sons to scatter, their states to perish, their altars of soil and grain to be lost, and their own persons to suffer misfortune. Thus, the common people of the world united in condemning them, and for ten thousand generations, their descendants continued to revile them without cease. They were named \"failed kings.\" This serves as evidence of their punishing the violent.\n\nNow, if the scholar-officials of the world wish to practice righteousness, they must not fail to align with the will of Heaven.

Thus, among the various states of the world, none would use water, fire, poison, or weapons to harm one another.

      "translated_text": "Someone asked: \"What is meant by *forceful rectitude*?\"\nThe answer: The great attack the small; the strong bully the weak; the many plunder the few; the cunning deceive the foolish; the noble disdain the humble; the rich arrogantly scorn the poor; the robust seize from the aged. Thus, among the various states of the world, all employ water, fire, poison, and weapons to harm one another. In serving above, this does not benefit Heaven; in the middle, it does not benefit the spirits; below, it does not benefit the people. With threefold harm and nothing benefited, this is called *banditry*. Therefore, all who act in accordance with this are rebels and usurpers, thieves and robbers, inhumane and unrighteous, disloyal and unkind, uncompassionate and unfilial. For this reason, they gather all the world’s evil names and are burdened with them.\n\nWhy is this so? It is because they oppose the will of Heaven.\n\nThus, Master Mozi established the will of Heaven as a standard, like a wheelwright’s compass or a carpenter’s square. Now, wheelwrights use compasses and carpenters use squares to distinguish between round and square. Therefore, Master Mozi established the will of Heaven as a standard, by which I know how far the gentlemen and nobles of the world have strayed from *rightness*.\n\nHow do I know they have strayed so far from *rightness*? Consider this: when the lord of a great state is lenient, he says, \"I rule a great state, yet I do not attack small states—how then can I be great?\" Thus, he selects his most cunning advisors, assembles his chariots and troops, and attacks blameless states. They breach their borders, reap their crops, fell their trees, and destroy their city walls to fortify their own moats. They burn ancestral temples and slaughter sacrificial animals. Those who resist are violently seized, while those who do not are bound and taken away. The men are made into servants and laborers, the women into millers and cooks. Yet these lords who delight in conquest do not recognize this as inhumane and unrighteous; instead, they boast to neighboring lords, saying, \"I have attacked a state, crushed an army, and slain so many generals!\" The neighboring lords, likewise unaware that this is inhumane and unrighteous, prepare gifts of furs and silk, dispatch envoys, and offer congratulations. Thus, these lords who delight in conquest, though they do not recognize this as inhumane and unrighteous, record their deeds on bamboo and silk and store them in their archives. Their descendants, wishing to follow their ancestors’ ways, will say, \"Why not open our archives and admire our forebears’ glorious methods?\" They will not say, \"These were the ways of Wen and Wu, the true *rectitude*.\" Instead, they will say, \"I have attacked a state, crushed an army, and slain so many generals!\" Thus, these lords who delight in conquest do not recognize this as inhumane and unrighteous, nor do their neighboring lords. This is why conquest continues unceasingly, generation after generation. This is what I mean when I say they do not recognize great matters.\n\nBut what of small matters? If someone were to enter another’s garden and take their peaches, plums, melons, or ginger, they would be punished upon discovery, and the crowd would condemn them. Why? Because they reap the fruits of another’s labor, taking what is not theirs. How much worse, then, is it to breach another’s walls, seize their sons and daughters, plunder their treasuries, steal their gold, jade, silk, and fine fabrics, or burn their stables and steal their cattle and horses? How much worse is it to kill even one innocent person?\n\nYet when kings, dukes, and great officials govern, if someone kills an innocent person, breaches another’s walls, seizes their sons and daughters, plunders their treasuries, steals their gold, jade, silk, and fine fabrics, or burns their stables and steals their cattle and horses—or even steals peaches, plums, melons, or ginger—they mete out punishments no different from those of the ancient sage-kings Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. Yet today, the lords of the world still invade, attack, and annex one another, killing thousands upon thousands of innocent people. They breach walls, seize sons and daughters, plunder treasuries, steal gold, jade, silk, and fine fabrics, burn stables, steal cattle and horses, and take peaches, plums, melons, and ginger—all by the thousands upon thousands. And they call this *rightness*!\n\nThus, Master Mozi said: \"Those who reproach me for this are no different from those who cannot distinguish between black and white or sweet and bitter.\" Consider this: if someone were shown a little black and called it black, but shown much black and called it white, they would say, \"My eyes are confused; I cannot tell black from white.\" Or if someone tasted a little sweetness and called it sweet, but tasted much and called it bitter, they would say, \"My mouth is confused; I cannot tell sweet from bitter.\" Yet when kings and great officials govern, if someone kills a person in their own state, they punish it. But if someone kills many people in a neighboring state, they call it *civilized rightness*—how is this different from confusing black and white or sweet and bitter?\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi established the will of Heaven as a standard. It is not only Master Mozi who took the will of Heaven as a model; the *Way of Great Xia* in the books of the former kings states: \"The Lord said to King Wen, 'I cherish and make bright your virtue. Do not be loud in voice or harsh in countenance; do not prolong summer with change. Act without cunning, without knowledge, following the patterns of the Lord.'\" This is how the proclamation instructed King Wen to take the will of Heaven as a model and follow the patterns of the Lord.\n\nNow, if the gentlemen and nobles of the world truly wish to practice *humaneness* and *rightness*, to become superior men, to uphold the *Way* of the sage-kings above and benefit their states and people below, they cannot fail to examine the will of Heaven.",

Moreover, how can it be that those who possess wealth and nobility alone may establish *rightness*?\n\nConsider this: when Heaven sends down its seasons, it does not favor the great states over the small, nor the noble over the humble.

      "translated_text": "**Mozi, Book Eight**\n**Chapter Thirty: \"On Ghosts, Part Two\"**\n**Chapter Thirty-One: \"On Ghosts, Part Three\"**\n\nMozi said: When the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties passed away, the world lost its *rightness*, and the feudal lords relied on force to rule. Thus, rulers and ministers, superiors and inferiors ceased to act with kindness and loyalty; fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers ceased to act with compassion, filial piety, brotherly respect, integrity, and goodness. Governors failed to exert themselves in hearing and administering governance, while the common people failed to exert themselves in their labors. The people turned to licentiousness, violence, banditry, and theft, using weapons, poison, water, and fire to harm the innocent on roads and paths, seizing others’ carriages, horses, clothes, and furs for their own gain—all these evils arose from this. Hence, the world fell into chaos.\n\nWhat was the reason for this? It was because people doubted the existence of ghosts and spirits and did not understand that ghosts and spirits reward the worthy and punish the violent. If today the people of the world truly believed that ghosts and spirits reward the worthy and punish the violent, how could the world be in chaos?\n\nThose who deny the existence of ghosts say: \"Ghosts and spirits simply do not exist.\" Day and night, they teach this to the world, causing the multitudes to doubt whether ghosts and spirits exist or not. This is why the world is in chaos.\n\nTherefore, Mozi said: If the kings, dukes, ministers, and gentlemen of the world truly wish to seek what benefits the world and eliminate what harms it, they must not fail to examine whether ghosts and spirits exist or not. Since it is clear that this matter cannot be left unexamined, how then should we investigate it?\n\nMozi said: The way to determine the existence or non-existence of ghosts and spirits must be based on the actual knowledge of the multitude—what they have heard and seen. Those who have not heard or seen them may claim they do not exist. But why not inquire in every village and hamlet, from ancient times to the present, since the beginning of human life? Have there ever been those who have seen the forms of ghosts and spirits or heard their voices? If so, how can one say ghosts and spirits do not exist? If no one has heard or seen them, then can one say they do exist?\n\nThose who deny the existence of ghosts say: \"The number of those in the world who claim to have heard or seen ghosts and spirits is beyond counting. But who has truly heard or seen the forms of ghosts and spirits?\"\n\nMozi said: If we rely on what the multitude has collectively seen and heard, then consider the case of Du Bo in ancient times. King Xuan of Zhou killed his minister Du Bo without just cause. Du Bo said: \"My lord has killed me without cause. If the dead are without knowledge, then let it be. But if the dead have knowledge, within three years, I will surely make my lord know it.\" Three years later, King Xuan of Zhou assembled the feudal lords for a hunt in the Pu Field. Hundreds of chariots followed, thousands of men filled the wilds. At midday, Du Bo, riding a white horse and a plain carriage, clad in red robes and cap, holding a red bow and red arrows, pursued King Xuan of Zhou. He shot an arrow into the king’s chariot, piercing his heart and breaking his spine. The king choked and died in his chariot. At that time, none of the Zhou followers present failed to see it, and none at a distance failed to hear of it. It was recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Zhou. Rulers used this to instruct their ministers, fathers to warn their sons, saying: \"Be cautious, be vigilant! Those who kill the innocent will not escape misfortune. The schemes of ghosts and spirits are swift and relentless!\" Judging by this account, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nNot only does this account attest to it, but consider also the case of Duke Mu of Zheng. One day at noon, while he was in the ancestral temple, a spirit entered through the left side of the gate. It had the body of a crow, wore plain white garments with three sashes, and its face was square. Duke Mu of Zheng saw it and was terrified, trembling. The spirit said: \"The Lord on High has enjoyed your bright virtue and grants you a lifespan of nineteen years. He will make your state prosperous, your descendants flourish, and ensure you do not lose your position.\" Duke Mu bowed twice and touched his head to the ground, saying: \"May I ask who you are?\" The spirit replied: \"I am Gou Mang.\" If we take Duke Mu’s personal encounter as evidence, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nNot only do these accounts attest to it, but consider also the case of Duke Jian of Yan, who killed his minister Zhuang Ziyi without just cause. Zhuang Ziyi said: \"My lord has killed me without cause. If the dead are without knowledge, then let it be. But if the dead have knowledge, within three years, I will surely make my lord know it.\" A year later, Duke Jian of Yan was about to hold the ancestral chariot race. The Yan ancestral race was as grand as the sacrifices to the altars of soil and grain in Qi, the mulberry groves in Song, and the Cloud Dream Marsh in Chu—an occasion where men and women gathered to watch. At midday, as Duke Jian was about to race on the ancestral path, Zhuang Ziyi, carrying a red staff, struck him and pinned him to his chariot. At that time, none of the Yan followers present failed to see it, and none at a distance failed to hear of it. It was recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Yan. The feudal lords transmitted the account, saying: \"Those who kill the innocent will not escape misfortune. The punishments of ghosts and spirits are swift and relentless!\" Judging by this account, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted?\n\nNot only do these accounts attest to it, but consider also the time of Duke Wen of Song, when there was a minister named Gu Gu. Once, while performing a sacrifice, the sacrificial victim was led out with a staff. The spirit addressed Gu Gu, saying: \"Gu Gu, why are the jade disks and ritual vessels not filled to the proper measure? Why are the wine and sweet liquor not pure, the music and offerings not solemn? Why are the sacrificial animals not whole and fat? Why are the spring, autumn, winter, and summer sacrifices not performed at the proper times? Is this your doing, or is it Duke Wen’s?\" Gu Gu replied: \"Duke Wen is young and weak, still in swaddling clothes. How could he know of these matters?\"",

These two had been litigating for three years, yet the case remained unresolved.

Thus, he had them share a sheep and swear an oath at the altar of the state’s spirit. Both men agreed. Thereupon, they dug a pit, slaughtered the sheep, and sprinkled its blood. As the oath of Wang Liguo was being recited to its end, and the oath of Zhongli Che had only reached its midpoint, the sheep suddenly rose and gored him, breaking his leg.

They would choose the tallest and most luxuriant trees to erect as the sacred altars. They would select the state’s most filial, virtuous, and upright elders to serve as invocators and ancestral masters. They would choose the finest, fattest, and most robust of the six livestock to serve as sacrificial victims. Jade tablets, bi-disks, and huang-ornaments were measured by wealth to determine their scale. They would select the most fragrant and golden of the five grains to prepare as wine, sweet liquor, and sacrificial offerings, so that the wine, sweet liquor, and grain offerings would rise and fall with the harvest’s abundance.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings in governing the world necessarily placed ghosts and spirits before men—this was their way. Therefore, it is said: the selection of officials and the examination of their merits came first; sacrificial vessels and robes were all stored in the treasury; invocators, ancestral masters, and their attendants were all appointed in the court; sacrificial victims were not kept with the common herds. Thus did the ancient sage-kings administer governance.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings made the service of ghosts and spirits their paramount duty, for ghosts and spirits are of profound importance. Yet they feared that later generations and descendants would fail to understand this, so they inscribed it on bamboo and silk to transmit to posterity. Still, they worried that these records might rot, decay, or vanish, leaving descendants without knowledge, so they carved them onto basins and bowls, engraved them on metal and stone, to lend them weight. They feared that later generations might fail to revere and uphold these teachings, so in the writings of the former kings, the sages—even a foot of silk or a single scroll—spoke repeatedly of the existence of ghosts and spirits, emphasizing it again and again.\n\nFor what reason?

      "translated_text": "Those who insist there are no ghosts say: \"Ghosts and spirits simply do not exist.\" This directly contradicts the duty of the sage-kings. To contradict the duty of the sage-kings is not the Way of the true noble person. Now, those who insist there are no ghosts say: \"In the writings of the former kings, there is not a foot of silk or a single scroll that speaks repeatedly of the existence of ghosts and spirits, emphasizing it again and again—what texts record such things? What texts affirm them?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: The *Book of Zhou* in the *Greater Odes* contains this. The *Greater Odes* says:\n*\"King Wen is on high,\nOh, radiant in Heaven.\nThough Zhou is an ancient state,\nIts mandate is ever renewed.\nThe glory of Zhou is not dim,\nFor the Lord’s decree is timely.\nKing Wen ascends and descends,\nEver at the Lord’s side.\nReverent is King Wen,\nHis good name unceasing.\"*\nIf ghosts and spirits did not exist, how could King Wen, after death, remain at the Lord’s side? This is how I know the *Book of Zhou* affirms ghosts.\n\nYet if only the *Book of Zhou* spoke of ghosts while the *Book of Shang* did not, it would not suffice as a model. Let us then examine the *Book of Shang*, which says:\n*\"Alas! In ancient times, when the Xia dynasty had not yet brought disaster upon itself, the hundred beasts and creeping things, even the flying birds, all followed the proper order. The earthworms and the human-faced creatures—how dared they harbor rebellious hearts? The mountain and river spirits, too, dared not disturb the peace. If one could truly act with sincerity, this would bring harmony to all under Heaven and preserve the lands below.\"*\nConsider why the mountain and river spirits dared not disturb the peace: it was because they aided and counseled Yu. This is how I know the *Books of Shang and Zhou* affirm ghosts.\n\nYet if only the *Book of Yu* spoke of ghosts while the *Book of Xia* did not, it would not suffice as a model. Let us then examine the *Book of Xia*. The *Oath of Yu* says:\n*\"At the great battle of Gan, the king commanded six men at his side to descend and receive the oath in the central army, saying: ‘The House of Youhu has defied the Five Phases and abandoned the Three Norms. Heaven will cut off its mandate.’ He declared: ‘At high noon, today I contend with the House of Youhu for the fate of a single day. Now, you ministers, great officers, and common people, I do not seek your fields, lands, or treasures—I am carrying out Heaven’s punishment. If the left flank fails in its duty to the left, or the right flank fails in its duty to the right, it is a failure of command. If the charioteers do not govern their horses properly, it is a failure of command.’ Thus, rewards were given at the ancestral temple, and punishments were meted out at the altar of the soil. Why were rewards given at the ancestral temple? To show that the distribution of commands was just. Why were punishments meted out at the altar of the soil? To show that the judgment of cases was proper.\"*\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings necessarily used ghosts and spirits to reward the worthy and punish the violent. Therefore, rewards were always given at the ancestral temple, and punishments were always meted out at the altar of the soil. This is how I know the *Book of Xia* affirms ghosts.\n\nThus, the *Classic of Documents*—the *Book of Xia*, followed by the *Books of Shang and Zhou*—speaks repeatedly of the existence of ghosts and spirits, emphasizing it again and again. For what reason? Because the sage-kings made this their duty.\n\nJudging by the explanations in these texts, how can the existence of ghosts and spirits be doubted? In ancient times, on an auspicious day, the ding-mao day, the Zhou dynasty performed the sacrifice to the soil altar, annually offering to the spirits of the soil to prolong life and longevity. If there were no ghosts and spirits, how could such offerings prolong life and longevity?\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: If ghosts and spirits truly reward the worthy and punish the violent, this principle, when applied to the state and extended to the myriad people, is indeed the Way to govern the state and benefit the people. To deny this is to claim that when officials govern the courts and bureaus without purity or integrity, or when men and women disregard proper distinctions, ghosts and spirits witness it. When the people engage in licentiousness, violence, banditry, theft, or use weapons, poison, water, or fire to harm the innocent on the roads, or seize others’ carriages, horses, clothes, and furs for their own gain, ghosts and spirits observe it.\n\nThus, officials dare not govern the courts and bureaus without purity or integrity. They dare not fail to reward the good or punish the violent. The people dare not engage in licentiousness, violence, banditry, or theft, or use weapons, poison, water, or fire to harm the innocent on the roads, or seize others’ carriages, horses, clothes, and furs for their own gain. Such acts cease, and none dare transgress.\n\nIn the hidden and obscure, they emulate the clarity of ghosts and spirits. In the open and manifest, even a single person fears the judgment from above. Thus, all under Heaven is well-governed. The clarity of ghosts and spirits extends even to the hidden depths of broad marshes, mountain forests, and deep valleys—they surely know all. The punishments of ghosts and spirits cannot be evaded by wealth, nobility, great numbers, or strength, nor by martial prowess, sturdy armor, or sharp weapons—they will surely prevail.\n\nTo deny this, consider the past: King Jie of Xia, though he was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, reviled Heaven above and insulted the spirits, while below he brought calamity and arrogance upon the myriad people. He defied the August Lord and violated the great norms of the mountains and rivers. Thus, Heaven sent Tang to execute its bright punishment. Tang, with nine chariots in formation, advanced like a flock of crows, riding in great triumph. He charged through the masses, capturing and subduing the mighty Xi. Thus, though King Jie of Xia was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, though he had the mighty Xi, who could wrestle tigers and rhinoceroses and kill men with a gesture, though his people numbered in the millions and his warriors filled the marshes and mounds, he could not withstand the punishment of the spirits. This is what I mean when I say the punishments of ghosts and spirits cannot be evaded by wealth, nobility, great numbers, or strength, nor by martial prowess, sturdy armor, or sharp weapons.\n\nMoreover, this is not the only instance. King Zhou of Yin, though he was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, reviled Heaven above and insulted the spirits, while below he brought calamity and arrogance upon the myriad people. He cast aside the elderly, murdered children, cruelly tortured the innocent, and disemboweled pregnant women.",

      "translated_text": "The widowed, orphaned, and destitute wailed in despair, with none to turn to. Thus, Heaven sent King Wu to execute its luminous punishment. With a hundred chariots of war and four hundred tiger-like warriors, he first dispatched envoys to observe the states and spy on the enemy, then joined battle with the men of Yin at the Wilds of Mu. The king captured Fei Zhong and E Lai, and the masses scattered in flight. King Wu pursued them into the palace, felled the thousand-year catalpa, broke Zhou’s body and bound it with red cords, then hoisted it upon a white banner as a warning to the feudal lords of the world.\n\nThus, though King Zhou of Yin was Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven, though he had mighty men like Fei Zhong, E Lai, and Chong Hou Hu who could point at the few and kill, though his people numbered in the millions and his warriors filled the marshes and mounds, he could not withstand the punishment of the spirits. This is what I mean when I say the punishments of ghosts and spirits cannot be evaded by wealth, nobility, great numbers, or strength, nor by martial prowess, sturdy armor, or sharp weapons.\n\nMoreover, the saying of the ancient sages goes: *\"Though the crime be small, destroy the clan; though the merit be slight, extinguish the lineage.\"* This means that what the ghosts and spirits reward, no matter how small, they will surely reward; what they punish, no matter how great, they will surely punish.\n\nNow, those who deny the existence of ghosts ask: *\"Do you mean to harm the interests of loyal kin and act against filial piety?\"* Master Mozi replied: *\"The ghosts of ancient and present times are none other than these: there are heavenly ghosts, ghosts of mountains and rivers, and those who become ghosts after death. Today, there are cases where sons die before their fathers, and younger brothers before their elder brothers. Though this may seem so, the common saying goes: 'The firstborn dies first.' If this is true, then those who die first are either fathers or mothers, elder brothers or sisters. Now, when we purify wine and millet, prepare offerings, and perform sacrifices with reverence, if ghosts and spirits truly exist, then we are feeding our parents, elder brothers, and sisters—is this not a great benefit? If ghosts and spirits do not exist, then we have merely wasted the wealth spent on wine, millet, and offerings. Yet even if we discard these into the ditches and ravines, within our clans and without in our villages, all may gather to share in the food and drink. Even if ghosts and spirits do not exist, this still serves to unite the people and foster goodwill among neighbors. Now, those who deny ghosts say: 'Ghosts and spirits do not exist at all,' and thus they refuse to share in the wealth spent on wine, millet, and sacrificial animals. Are they not simply hoarding these resources? What benefit do they gain? This contradicts the teachings of the sage kings, opposes the conduct of filial children among the people, and is no way to be a superior man in the world. Therefore, Master Mozi said: 'When I perform sacrifices, I do not merely cast offerings into the ditches and ravines. Above, it serves to commune with the blessings of the spirits; below, it unites the people and fosters goodwill among neighbors. If the spirits exist, then we are feeding our parents, brothers, and sisters—is this not a great benefit to the world?' Thus, Master Mozi said: 'If the kings, dukes, great officials, and gentlemen of the world truly wish to seek the welfare of all under Heaven and eliminate its harms, they must treat ghosts and spirits as real and honor them with clarity. This is the Way of the sage kings.'*\n\n**Against Music, Part 32**\nMaster Mozi said: *\"The task of the benevolent is necessarily to seek the welfare of all under Heaven and eliminate its harms. Let this be the standard for the world: if it benefits the people, do it; if it does not, stop. Moreover, the benevolent, in their deliberations for the world, do not act for the beauty of their eyes, the pleasure of their ears, the sweetness of their mouths, or the comfort of their bodies, thereby depleting the people’s resources for clothing and food. The benevolent do not do this. Thus, Master Mozi’s opposition to music is not because the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, flutes, and reed organs are not joyful, nor because carved and painted patterns are not beautiful, nor because the flavors of fattened and roasted meats are not sweet, nor because lofty towers and deep chambers are not comfortable. Though my body knows comfort, my mouth knows sweetness, my eyes know beauty, and my ears know joy, when I examine it above, it does not accord with the affairs of the sage kings, and when I measure it below, it does not benefit the people. Therefore, Master Mozi said: 'Music is wrong.' Now, though kings and great officials do not create musical instruments for the sake of the state, they do not merely gather clay and break earth to make them. They must heavily tax the people to produce the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, flutes, and reed organs. It is like the sage kings’ creation of boats and carts—I dare not oppose it. The ancient sage kings also heavily taxed the people to make boats and carts. Once completed, they asked: 'How shall we use them?' They said: 'Boats are for water, carts for land. The noble rest their feet, and the common people rest their shoulders and backs.' Thus, the people contributed their wealth to provide these, yet they did not resent it. Why? Because it returned to benefit the people. If musical instruments likewise benefit the people, then I dare not oppose them. But the people have three great afflictions: the hungry cannot eat, the cold cannot dress, and the weary cannot rest. Yet in such times, should we strike great bells, beat drums, pluck zithers, blow pipes and flutes, and brandish shields and axes, how can the people’s resources for clothing and food be obtained? I do not believe this is necessarily so.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Leaving this aside, consider now: when a great state attacks a small state, when a powerful clan oppresses a weaker one, when the strong plunder the weak, the many tyrannize the few, the cunning deceive the simple, the noble despise the humble—when bandits, rebels, thieves, and robbers arise together, unrestrained and unchecked. Yet in such times, should we strike great bells, beat drums, pluck zithers, blow pipes and flutes, and brandish shields and axes, how can the chaos of the world be governed and set right? I do not believe this is necessarily so.\n\nThus Master Mozi said: Suppose we heavily tax the people to produce the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, and flutes, seeking to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm—it would be of no avail. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nNow, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials stand upon lofty towers and spacious pavilions to observe, the bells are like suspended cauldrons—if they are not struck, what joy can be derived? Their reasoning must be that they must be struck. Yet if they are not struck, the old and slow cannot be employed. The old and slow have dull ears and dim eyes, weak limbs, discordant voices, and clumsy movements. They must employ those in their prime, whose ears and eyes are sharp, whose limbs are strong, whose voices are harmonious, and whose brows are nimble. If men are made to perform this, they abandon the times for plowing, planting, and cultivating; if women are made to perform this, they abandon their spinning, weaving, and sewing. Now, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials indulge in music, they waste the people’s time for clothing and food—this is excessive. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nOnce the sounds of great bells, drums, zithers, pipes, and flutes are prepared, if the nobles grandly perform and listen alone, what joy can be derived? Their reasoning must be that they must share it with the lowly. Yet if they do not share it with the noble, the noble neglect their governance; if they share it with the lowly, the lowly neglect their tasks. Now, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials indulge in music, they waste the people’s resources for clothing and food—this is excessive. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nIn former times, Duke Kang of Qi established the *Music of Ten Thousand*, yet ten thousand men could not be clothed in coarse hemp nor fed with husks and dregs. He said: \"If food and drink are not fine, their faces and complexions are unworthy to behold; if clothing is not fine, their bodies and movements are unsightly and emaciated.\" Thus, they must eat millet and meat, wear embroidered silks—those who do not engage in producing clothing and food yet consume the people’s resources. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Now, when kings and nobles, high ministers and great officials waste the people’s resources for clothing and food to indulge in music—this is excessive. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nHumans are fundamentally different from birds, beasts, deer, crows, and insects. Birds, beasts, deer, crows, and insects use their feathers and fur for clothing, their hooves and claws for shoes, and water and grass for food and drink. Thus, the males need not plow, plant, or cultivate, nor the females spin, weave, or sew—their resources for clothing and food are already provided. Humans are not like this: those who rely on their strength govern, while those who do not rely on their strength do not govern. If the noble do not diligently govern, then laws and policies fall into chaos; if the lowly do not diligently work, then resources and supplies become insufficient.\n\nIf the gentlemen of the world do not accept my words, then let us briefly enumerate the world’s duties and observe the harm of music. Kings and nobles rise early and retire late to hear lawsuits and administer governance—this is their duty. Gentlemen exhaust their strength and employ their wisdom to manage internal offices and externally gather the profits of passes, markets, mountains, forests, and marshes to fill granaries and treasuries—this is their duty. Farmers rise early and return late to plow, plant, and cultivate, amassing grain—this is their duty. Women rise early and sleep late to spin, weave, and sew, producing much hemp, silk, kudzu, and fine cloth—this is their duty.\n\nNow, if kings and nobles delight in music and listen to it, they cannot rise early and retire late to hear lawsuits and administer governance—thus, the state falls into chaos and the altars of soil and grain are endangered. If gentlemen delight in music and listen to it, they cannot exhaust their strength and employ their wisdom to manage internal offices and externally gather profits to fill granaries and treasuries—thus, granaries and treasuries remain empty. If farmers delight in music and listen to it, they cannot rise early and return late to plow, plant, and cultivate—thus, grain is insufficient. If women delight in music and listen to it, they cannot rise early and sleep late to spin, weave, and sew—thus, cloth is not produced.\n\nIt is asked: What causes the noble to neglect governance and the state to abandon its tasks? It is music. Therefore, Master Mozi said: Music is wrong.\n\nHow do we know this is so? It is said: The *Punishments of the Officials* in the books of the former kings, those of Tang, record this.",

      "translated_text": "Master Mozi declared: In ancient times, the kings, dukes, and great men who governed states all desired their states to be prosperous, their people numerous, and their governance orderly. Yet instead of prosperity, they found poverty; instead of a multitude, they found few; instead of order, they found chaos. Thus, they lost what they sought and gained what they detested—why was this so?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: It is because those who cling to the doctrine of fate have mingled abundantly among the people. The words of those who cling to fate say: If fate decrees wealth, one is wealthy; if fate decrees poverty, one is poor. If fate decrees a multitude, there is a multitude; if fate decrees few, there are few. If fate decrees order, there is order; if fate decrees chaos, there is chaos. If fate decrees long life, one lives long; if fate decrees early death, one dies young. Though one may strive with all one’s might, what benefit is there?\n\nAbove, this doctrine pleases kings, dukes, and great men; below, it governs the people’s undertakings. Thus, those who cling to fate are unvirtuous. Therefore, the words of those who cling to fate must be clearly examined. How then shall we clearly examine this doctrine?\n\nMaster Mozi declared: One must establish a standard. To speak without a standard is like trying to determine morning and evening while standing atop a potter’s wheel. The distinctions between right and wrong, benefit and harm cannot be clearly known. Thus, speech must have three measures.\n\nWhat are the three measures? Master Mozi declared: There is the measure of foundation, the measure of origin, and the measure of application. What is the foundation? Above, it is founded upon the affairs of the ancient sage-kings. What is the origin? Below, it examines the actual experiences of the people’s ears and eyes. What is the application? It is applied in governance and penal law, observing whether it benefits the state, the people, and the populace. These are what are called the three measures of speech.\n\nYet today, the scholars and gentlemen of the world who claim fate exists have never truly examined the affairs of the sage-kings. In ancient times, the chaos wrought by Jie was received and rectified by Tang; the chaos wrought by Zhou was received and rectified by King Wu. The world had not changed, nor had the people altered. Under Jie and Zhou, the world was in chaos; under Tang and Wu, the world was ordered—how can this be called fate?\n\nYet today, the scholars and gentlemen of the world who claim fate exists have also not examined the books of the former kings. The books of the former kings, which issued state decrees and disseminated laws among the people, did they ever contain such sayings as: \"Fortune cannot be sought, misfortune cannot be avoided; reverence is of no benefit, violence incurs no harm\"? The laws by which judgments were heard and punishments meted out—did the former kings’ penal codes ever say: \"Fortune cannot be sought, misfortune cannot be avoided; reverence is of no benefit, violence incurs no harm\"? The oaths by which armies were arrayed and troops advanced or retreated—did the former kings’ oaths ever say: \"Fortune cannot be sought, misfortune cannot be avoided; reverence is of no benefit, violence incurs no harm\"?\n\nThus, Master Mozi declared: Though I have not exhaustively enumerated them, the fine books of the world cannot all be counted, but in broad terms, these five are sufficient. Now, if we do not seek the words of those who cling to fate, we need not necessarily accept them—is this not a proper rejection? To employ the words of those who cling to fate is to overturn the righteousness of the world. Those who overturn the world’s righteousness are the ones who establish fate, the critics of the common people. To propagate the criticism of the common people is to extinguish the people of the world.\n\nThen what is the purpose of desiring the virtuous to be in high positions? It is said: When the virtuous are in high positions, the world will surely be ordered. The spirits of Heaven, mountains, and rivers will surely have a lord to rely upon, and the myriad people will receive great benefit. How do we know this?\n\nMaster Mozi said: In ancient times, Tang was enfeoffed in Bo, where he adjusted the long and short to make a territory of a hundred *li*. With his people, he practiced universal love and mutual benefit, sharing in times of plenty. He led his people to revere Heaven above and serve the spirits. Thus, the spirits of Heaven enriched him, the feudal lords allied with him, the people cherished him, and worthy scholars flocked to him. Before his generation had passed, he reigned over the world and governed the feudal lords.\n\nFormerly, King Wen was enfeoffed in Qi Zhou, where he adjusted the long and short to make a territory of a hundred *li*. With his people, he practiced universal love and mutual benefit. Thus, those near were at peace with his governance, and those far were drawn to his virtue. Those who heard of King Wen all hastened to him. The incapable and unworthy, whose limbs were not benefited, remained and longed, saying: \"How might King Wen’s land reach me? Then would I not also be like King Wen’s people?\" Thus, the spirits of Heaven enriched him, the feudal lords allied with him, the people cherished him, and worthy scholars flocked to him. Before his generation had passed, he reigned over the world and governed the feudal lords.\n\nAs previously stated: When the virtuous are in high positions, the world will surely be ordered. The spirits of Heaven, mountains, and rivers will surely have a lord to rely upon, and the myriad people will receive great benefit. This is how we know it.\n\nThus, the ancient sage-kings issued decrees and commands, establishing rewards and punishments to encourage the worthy. Therefore, at home, they were filial and kind to their kin; abroad, they were respectful and dutiful in their villages. In sitting and dwelling, they had moderation; in going out and coming in, they had restraint. Men and women had distinction. Thus, when managing government offices, there was no theft; when guarding cities, there was no collapse or rebellion. When the lord faced peril, they died for him; when he went into exile, they followed him. These are what the rulers rewarded and the people praised.\n\nThe words of those who cling to fate say: What the rulers reward is simply what fate had already destined to be rewarded, not because of worthiness. What the rulers punish is simply what fate had already destined to be punished, not because of violence. Therefore, at home, they are not kind and filial to their kin; abroad, they are not respectful and dutiful in their villages. In sitting and dwelling, they lack moderation; in going out and coming in, they lack restraint. Men and women lack distinction. Thus, when managing government offices, there is theft; when guarding cities, there is collapse and rebellion. When the lord faces peril, they do not die for him; when he goes into exile, they do not follow him.",

      "translated_text": "These are what the rulers punish and the people condemn.\n\nThose who cling to fate say: What the rulers punish is simply what fate had already destined to be punished, not because of violence. What the rulers reward is simply what fate had already destined to be rewarded, not because of worthiness. If one takes this as a principle for being a lord, one is unrighteous; for being a minister, one is disloyal; for being a father, one is unkind; for being a son, one is unfilial; for being an elder brother, one is unvirtuous; for being a younger brother, one is undutiful. Those who stubbornly adhere to this give rise to inauspicious words and follow the way of the violent.\n\nHow, then, do we know that fate is the way of the violent? In ancient times, the impoverished among the people were gluttonous in food and drink, lazy in their duties, and thus lacked sufficient clothing and resources, bringing upon themselves the worries of hunger, cold, and starvation. Yet they did not say, \"I am weary and unworthy; I do not work diligently.\" Instead, they said, \"My fate is destined to be poor and suffering.\" The violent kings of ancient times could not endure the excesses of their ears and eyes, the perversity of their hearts, and their disobedience to their kin, leading to the loss of their states and the overthrow of their altars of soil and grain. Yet they did not say, \"I am weary and unworthy; I govern poorly.\" Instead, they said, \"My fate is destined to lose them.\"\n\nIn *The Announcement of Zhong Hui*, it is said: \"I have heard from the Xia people that they falsified the Mandate of Heaven and spread it among the people. The Lord punished their evil, and their armies were utterly defeated.\" This speaks of Tang’s rejection of Jie’s clinging to fate. In *The Great Declaration*, it is said: \"Zhou of Yin dwelled in ease, refusing to serve the Lord on High and the ghosts and spirits, bringing disaster upon his ancestral spirits and cutting off their sacrifices.\" Yet he said, \"My people have their fate; there is no need for concern.\" Thus, Heaven abandoned him, casting him aside and refusing to protect him. This speaks of King Wu’s rejection of Zhou’s clinging to fate.\n\nIf we now adopt the words of those who cling to fate, then rulers will not heed governance, and the people will not attend to their duties. If rulers do not heed governance, then penal laws and administration will fall into chaos. If the people do not attend to their duties, then resources and supplies will be insufficient. Above, there will be nothing to provide for the grand sacrifices of wine and sweet liquor, to offer sacrifices to the Lord on High and the ghosts and spirits, to bestow grace upon the worthy and capable throughout the world. Abroad, there will be nothing to respond to the visits of the feudal lords’ envoys; at home, there will be nothing to feed the hungry, clothe the cold, and care for the elderly and weak. Thus, fate brings no benefit to Heaven above, no benefit to the ghosts and spirits in the middle, and no benefit to the people below. Those who stubbornly adhere to this give rise to inauspicious words and follow the way of the violent.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: Now, if the gentlemen and scholars of the world truly desire wealth for the world and detest its poverty, desire order and detest chaos, they cannot but reject the words of those who cling to fate. This is the great harm of the world.\n\n**Against Fate, Part Three (36)**\nMaster Mozi said: Whenever one speaks or engages in literary discourse as a Way, one must first establish standards of rightness. If one speaks without rightness, it is like placing the markers for dawn and dusk on a potter’s wheel—even with the most skillful craftsman, one cannot obtain correctness. Yet today, the true and false in the world cannot be discerned, so speech must have three methods.\n\nWhat are these three methods? There is the method of grounding, the method of tracing origins, and the method of application. In grounding, one examines the will of Heaven and the spirits and the affairs of the sage-kings. In tracing origins, one verifies with the books of the former kings. How does one apply them? By issuing them as penal laws. These are the three methods of speech.\n\nNow, some gentlemen and scholars of the world claim that fate does not exist. How do I know whether fate exists or not? By the evidence of the common people’s ears and eyes. What is heard and seen is said to exist; what is neither heard nor seen is said not to exist. Yet have they ever examined the sentiments of the people? From ancient times to the present, since the beginning of human life, has anyone ever seen the form of fate or heard the voice of fate? There has never been such a thing. If one considers the common people foolish and unworthy, their ears and eyes insufficient to serve as standards, then why not examine the transmitted words and flowing sayings of the feudal lords? From ancient times to the present, since the beginning of human life, has anyone ever heard the voice of fate or seen the form of fate? There has never been such a thing. Then why not examine the affairs of the sage-kings?\n\nThe sage-kings of old promoted filial sons and encouraged them to serve their parents, honored the worthy and good and encouraged them to do good, issued decrees and mandates to instruct, and employed rewards and punishments to encourage and deter. In this way, the chaotic could be ordered, and the endangered could be secured. If one does not believe this, consider: what Jie threw into chaos, Tang put in order; what Zhou threw into chaos, King Wu put in order. The world did not change, nor did the people alter, yet when the rulers changed their governance, the people’s teachings were transformed. Under Tang and Wu, there was order; under Jie and Zhou, there was chaos. Peace and danger, order and chaos, depend on the rulers’ issuance of governance—how can one speak of fate? Those who say there is fate are simply incorrect.\n\nNow, those who speak of fate say: \"I did not create this for later generations; from the Three Dynasties onward, such words have been transmitted and circulated.\" How should one respond to this? One should say: Do those who speak of fate not recall the sagely and good people of the Three Dynasties? Or do they recall the violent and unworthy people of the Three Dynasties? How do we know this?\n\nIn ancient times, the knights and grand officers were cautious in speech and wise in conduct. Above, they had means to admonish their rulers and lords; below, they had means to instruct and guide their people. Thus, above, they received the rewards of their rulers and lords; below, they received the praise of their people. The reputations of the knights and grand officers were not forgotten, and their words have been transmitted to the present day. The world says it was by their own efforts.",

      "translated_text": "Those who neglect the governance of their state and the welfare of their people, indulge in useless extravagance, and oppress the common folk, causing the lower ranks to grow estranged from their superiors—such rulers leave their nations desolate and ruined, their own bodies subject to punishment and execution. They cannot claim, \"I have seen fate at work.\"\n\nThus, the violent kings of the Three Dynasties did not restrain their indulgence in sensual pleasures, nor did they guard against the perversion of their hearts and wills. Outwardly, they galloped in hunting and archery; inwardly, they drowned in wine and revelry, exhausting themselves in worthlessness. When their governance and policies failed, they inevitably declared, \"It is my fate, and thus it must be.\" Even the impoverished commoners of the Three Dynasties followed this pattern: failing to serve their kin and superiors with goodness, despising reverence and frugality while favoring ease and simplicity, craving food and drink yet shirking labor—when their clothing and provisions fell short, leaving them to suffer cold, hunger, and want, they did not say, \"I am worthless and slow in my work,\" but instead insisted, \"My fate is inherently one of poverty.\" Even the deceitful people of the Three Dynasties acted no differently.\n\nThe doctrine of fate, embellished and propagated, has long misled the simple and unlearned. The sage-kings, recognizing this danger, inscribed their warnings on bamboo and silk, carved them into metal and stone. In the *Announcement of Zhong Hui* from the books of the former kings, it is said: \"I have heard that in the Xia, men falsely claimed the Mandate of Heaven, proclaiming it to the people below. The Lord detested this, and thus their armies were defeated.\" These words condemn Jie of Xia for his belief in fate, a doctrine that Tang and Zhong Hui jointly rejected.\n\nIn the *Great Declaration* of the former kings, it is further stated: \"Zhou of Yin dwelled in arrogance, refusing to serve the Supreme God, abandoning the sacrifices to his ancestral spirits. He declared, 'My people have their fate; let them not be burdened with toil.' Thus, Heaven cast him aside, no longer protecting him.\" These words condemn Zhou for his belief in fate, a doctrine that King Wu refuted with the *Great Declaration*.\n\nIn the *Three Dynasties’ Lost States*, it is written: \"You must not exalt the notion of fate bestowed by Heaven.\" The *Three Lost States* likewise deny the existence of fate. In the *Decree of the Duke of Shao*, it is commanded: \"Be reverent! There is no Mandate of Heaven—only we two must not spread falsehoods, nor claim that what we have not received descends from Heaven.\"\n\nIn the poetry and documents of the Shang and Xia, it is said: \"The doctrine of fate was created by violent kings.\" Now, if the gentlemen and scholars of the world wish to discern right from wrong and weigh benefit against harm, they must vigorously oppose the doctrine of fate. Those who cling to fate are the greatest harm to the world, and thus Master Mozi rejects it.\n\n**Against Fate, Part Three (Chapter 37)**\nMaster Mozi said: In all speech and discourse, one must first establish a standard before speaking. Without a prior standard, it is like trying to determine east and west while spinning a potter’s wheel—though one may debate morning and evening, no definitive conclusion can ever be reached. Thus, speech has three methods.\n\nWhat are the three methods? They are: verification, investigation, and application. How does one verify? By examining the deeds of the former sage-kings. How does one investigate? By observing the consensus of the people’s senses and experiences. How does one apply? By implementing policies in the state and observing their effects on the myriad people. These are the three methods.\n\nThus, when the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—governed the world, they declared: \"We must promote filial sons and encourage them to serve their parents, honor the worthy and good, and instruct them in virtue.\" Therefore, they issued policies and teachings, rewarding the good and punishing the violent. By doing so, they believed the world’s chaos could be brought to order, and the peril of the altars of soil and grain could be stabilized.\n\nIf one doubts this, consider: the disorder caused by Jie was rectified by Tang; the disorder caused by Zhou was rectified by King Wu. During these transitions, the world did not change, nor did the people alter, yet when the rulers transformed their governance, the people’s customs shifted. Under Jie and Zhou, the world was in chaos; under Tang and Wu, the world was at peace. The order of the world was the achievement of Tang and Wu; the chaos of the world was the fault of Jie and Zhou. From this, we see that safety and danger, order and disorder, depend on the governance of those above—how then can one speak of fate?\n\nThus, when Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu governed the world, they declared: \"We must ensure the hungry are fed, the cold are clothed, the weary find rest, and the disordered are brought to order.\" As a result, they gained illustrious reputations throughout the world. How could this be attributed to fate? It was clearly the result of their efforts.\n\nNow, the worthy and good, who honor virtue and value the Dao and its arts, receive the rewards of kings, dukes, and great men above, and the praise of the myriad people below. They too gain illustrious reputations throughout the world. How could this be attributed to fate? It is also the result of their efforts.\n\nYet those who today assert the existence of fate—do they not recall the sagely and good people of the Three Dynasties? Or do they recall the violent and unworthy? If we examine their claims, they must not be referring to the sagely and good of the Three Dynasties, but rather the violent and unworthy. Indeed, those who today insist on the existence of fate point to the violent kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—who, though noble as Sons of Heaven and wealthy as rulers of all under Heaven, did not restrain their sensual desires or guard against the perversion of their hearts. Outwardly, they galloped in hunting and archery; inwardly, they drowned in wine and revelry, neglecting the governance of their states and the welfare of their people. Indulging in useless extravagance and oppressing the common folk, they ultimately lost their ancestral temples. Yet they did not say, \"I am worthless and weak in governance,\" but instead insisted, \"My fate was inherently one of loss.\"",

      "translated_text": "Even the weak and unworthy common folk of the Three Dynasties were no different. Unable to serve their kin, rulers, and elders with goodness, they deeply despised reverence and frugality, favoring simplicity and ease. Greedy for food and drink, they were lazy in their duties, so their clothing and provisions fell short, and they thus suffered the worries of hunger, cold, and want. Yet they did not say, \"I am weak and unworthy, my efforts are insufficient,\" but instead insisted, \"My fate was inherently one of poverty.\"\n\nThe false people of the Three Dynasties were just the same. When the violent kings arose, they impoverished and ruined them—all because they doubted the multitude, despised simplicity, and troubled the former sagely kings. This was already a concern long before. Thus, it was inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, engraved on basins and bowls, and passed down to later generations of descendants. What writings remain? The *Total Virtue of Yu* records: \"Truly, it is not that Heaven is unmanifest, but that the people do not preserve it. Once the heart turns to evil, Heaven inflicts blame. If one does not carefully guard their virtue, how can Heaven’s mandate be preserved?\"\n\nThe *Announcement of Zhong Hui* states: \"I have heard that the people of Xia falsely claimed the Mandate of Heaven below, and the Lord thus increased their punishment, bringing ruin to their hosts.\" To call what is not into being is called \"falsification.\" If something exists and is called so, how could that be called falsification? In the past, Jie clung to the notion of fate and acted accordingly, so Tang composed the *Announcement of Zhong Hui* to refute him.\n\nThe words of the *Great Declaration* say, in the *Departure of Fa*: \"Alas, noble men! Heaven has manifest virtue, and its conduct is most evident. The mirror is not far off—it lies in the former Yin kings. They claimed that men have fate, that reverence cannot be practiced, that sacrifices are of no benefit, and that violence brings no harm. Heaven is not constant; the Nine Provinces perished because of this. Heaven is not compliant; prayers brought down their ruin. Only we, the Zhou, received the great mandate from the Supreme Lord.\" In the past, Zhou clung to the notion of fate and acted accordingly, so King Wu composed the *Great Declaration* and the *Departure of Fa* to refute him.\n\nHe said: \"Why do you not examine the records of Shang, Zhou, Yu, and Xia, or consult the chapters of the *Ten Bamboo Slips*? None of them contain such claims—what then should be done?\" Therefore, Master Mozi said: \"When the gentlemen of the world today engage in literature or speak, it is not merely to exercise their tongues or benefit their lips and jaws. In truth, they seek to govern their states, cities, and the myriad people with proper punishments and policies.\"\n\nNow, why do the kings, dukes, and great officials rise early and retire late, hearing lawsuits and managing governance, laboring all day to distribute duties without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, there will be order; if not, there will be chaos. If we are strong, there will be peace; if not, there will be danger. Thus, we dare not rest or grow weary.\"\n\nWhy do the ministers and great officers exhaust the strength of their limbs and strain their minds, managing offices within and gathering the profits of passes, markets, mountains, forests, marshes, and weirs without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, we will be honored; if not, we will be disgraced. If we are strong, we will be glorious; if not, we will be shamed. Thus, we dare not rest or grow weary.\"\n\nWhy do farmers rise early and return late, striving in plowing, planting, and cultivation, amassing much grain without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, we will be rich; if not, we will be poor. If we are strong, we will be full; if not, we will be hungry. Thus, we dare not rest or grow weary.\"\n\nWhy do women rise early and sleep late, striving in spinning, weaving, and fine work, producing much hemp, ramie, and cloth without daring to rest or grow weary? They say: \"If we are strong, we will be rich; if not, we will be poor. If we are strong, we will be warm; if not, we will be cold. Thus, we dare not grow weary.\"\n\nNow, if even those who are not kings, dukes, or great officials truly believed in fate and acted accordingly, they would surely cease hearing lawsuits and managing governance. Ministers and great officers would cease managing offices. Farmers would cease plowing, planting, and cultivation. Women would cease spinning, weaving, and sewing. If kings, dukes, and great officials ceased hearing lawsuits and managing governance, and ministers and great officers ceased managing offices, then I say the world would surely fall into chaos. If farmers ceased plowing, planting, and cultivation, and women ceased spinning, weaving, and sewing, then I say the world’s clothing and provisions would surely be insufficient.\n\nIf one were to govern the world in this way, serving the spirits of Heaven above, the spirits would not respond; providing for the hundred clans below, the people would gain no benefit and would inevitably scatter, becoming unusable. Thus, defenses would not hold, and punishments would not prevail. This is why even the violent kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—lost their states and overthrew their altars of soil and grain.\n\nTherefore, Master Mozi said: \"Now, the scholars and gentlemen of the world who truly seek to promote the world’s benefit and eliminate its harm must reject the words of those who claim fate exists. Fate is what violent kings fabricated and impoverished men relied upon—it is not the speech of the benevolent. Now, those who practice benevolence and righteousness must carefully examine and strongly refute this.\"\n\n*Against the Confucians, Part One (Chapter 38, missing)*\n*Against the Confucians, Part Two (Chapter 39)*\n\nThe Confucians say: \"Loving one’s kin has its methods, and honoring the worthy has its degrees.\" They speak of the differences between close and distant, noble and base. Their rites say: \"For the mourning of parents, three years; for the eldest son, three years; for uncles, brothers, and sons by concubines, one year; for distant relatives, five months.\" If the duration of mourning is based on closeness, then the closer one is, the longer the mourning, and the more distant, the shorter. Thus, a wife and eldest son would mourn as long as a father. If it is based on nobility, then this would mean honoring one’s wife and son as much as one’s parents, while treating uncles and elder brothers of the clan as inferior to one’s son.",

      "translated_text": "How could there be a greater perversion? When their kin die, they line the doors with white, climb onto the roof to peer into wells, poke into rat holes, and rummage through washbasins in search of the departed. If they truly believe the dead are there, their delusion is extreme. If they know the dead are gone yet still search, their deceit is profound. When taking a wife, they personally go to receive her, bowing and trembling like servants, holding the reins and offering the carriage strap as if facing a stern parent. The rites and solemnity of the wedding ceremony rival those of ancestral sacrifices. They invert the proper order, defying and dishonoring parents, elevating wives and children while wives and children encroach upon their superiors. Can such conduct toward parents be called filial?\n\nThe tradition holds that when welcoming a wife, she serves at one ancestral sacrifice, and the son will guard the ancestral temple—hence its gravity. To this, we respond: This is a falsehood. A man’s elder brother guards the ancestral temple for decades, and when he dies, his mourning period is brief, while his younger brother’s wife continues the ancestral sacrifices without interruption. Thus, mourning a wife or son for three years cannot be for the sake of guarding or serving the sacrifices. They claim that grieving for wives and children with great lamentation is to honor kinship. But to exalt what should be secondary and belittle what should be primary—is this not the height of treachery?\n\nSome stubbornly cling to the doctrine of fate, arguing: \"Longevity and early death, wealth and poverty, safety and danger, order and chaos—all are fixed by heaven’s decree and cannot be altered. Rewards and punishments, fortune and misfortune have their limits; human knowledge and effort cannot change them.\" If officials believe this, they will neglect their duties. If commoners believe it, they will abandon their work. Neglect leads to disorder, and slackened farming leads to poverty—poverty and disorder are the roots of misgovernment. Yet the Confucians teach this as the Way, thereby demeaning the people of the world.\n\nMoreover, they adorn rites and music to lead people astray, prolong mourning with feigned sorrow to deceive their kin, preach fate to excuse poverty while living in idleness, abandon fundamentals and duties to seek ease. Greedy for food and drink, lazy in their labors, they fall into hunger and cold, perilously close to starvation, with no means to escape. They exhaust human *qi*, hoarding like rats and gazing like sheep, leaping like hares. The nobleman laughs at them, and they grow angry, retorting: \"You fool! What do you know of true Confucians!\"\n\nIn summer, they beg for wheat and grain. Once the five grains are harvested, they follow grand funerals, bringing along their entire families to feast until sated, attending to multiple burials until satisfied. They rely on others’ households for sustenance, depend on others’ fields for their livelihood, and when the wealthy have a funeral, they rejoice greatly, saying: \"This is our source of food and clothing.\"\n\nThe Confucians say: \"The noble man must wear the speech of antiquity to be humane.\" We reply: What they call \"ancient\" was all once new, and the ancients wore it—thus they were noble men. Then must one imitate what is *not* the attire of noble men, speak what is *not* the speech of noble men, to be humane?\n\nThey also say: \"The noble man follows but does not innovate.\" We reply: In ancient times, Yi invented the bow, Zi made armor, Xizhong built the chariot, and Qiaochui crafted the boat. Then are today’s tanners, armorers, wheelwrights, and shipbuilders all noble men, while Yi, Zi, Xizhong, and Qiaochui were petty men? Furthermore, what they follow must have been created by someone—then all they follow are the ways of petty men.\n\nThey say: \"The noble man, when victorious, does not pursue the fleeing, casts aside the quiver without shooting, and if the enemy is strong, assists them in righting their chariot.\" We reply: If all were humane, there would be no need for such rules—they would naturally guide one another by the principles of right and wrong in their choices. The ignorant would follow the wise, the uninformed would yield to the informed, the wordless would submit to reason, and upon seeing goodness, they would reform. Why would they need such constraints? But if violent men clash in brutal conflict, and the victor refrains from pursuing the fleeing, discards the quiver without shooting, and helps the enemy right their chariot, even if he did all this, he could not be called a noble man.\n\nImagine a brutal and cruel state where a sage arises to rid the world of harm, raising an army to punish the wicked. The victorious general issues orders to his soldiers: \"Do not pursue the fleeing, cast aside the quiver without shooting, and if they falter, help them right their chariot.\" The violent and lawless would survive, the world’s harm would remain unchecked, and this would be to spare the murderers of parents and deeply degrade the age—no greater injustice exists.\n\nThey also say: \"You are like a bell: strike it, and it rings; do not strike it, and it remains silent.\" We reply: The humane man serves his lord with utmost loyalty, serves his parents with filial devotion, strives for goodness and excels, and admonishes when there is fault—this is the way of a minister. But to ring only when struck, to remain silent unless questioned, to conceal knowledge and strength, to wait passively for inquiry before responding—even if his lord or parents faced great benefit or harm, he would not speak unless asked. If a great rebellion were brewing, bandits about to rise, or a trap about to spring, and he alone knew while others did not, even with his lord and parents present, he would not speak unless questioned—such a man is a traitor to great disorder.\n\nTo serve as a minister thus is disloyal, as a son is unfilial, as a younger brother is undutiful, and in dealings with others is untrustworthy. In a court that values silence, people act only for profit. Though he fears speaking last, if his lord’s words bring no benefit, he folds his hands, gazes downward, and feigns deep contemplation, saying: \"It is only that he has not studied this.\" Whom does he serve in haste? His conduct strays far indeed.\n\nThe single Way of learning and practice is humanity and rightness. In great matters, it governs people; in small matters, it qualifies one for office. Applied broadly, it benefits all; applied narrowly, it guides the self. It does not dwell in unrighteousness, nor act against reason. It strives to advance the world’s benefit, adapting to circumstances, ceasing when benefit is achieved—this is the noble man’s Way. But what we have heard of Confucius’ conduct is fundamentally opposed to this.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi asked Yanzi: \"What sort of man is Confucius?\"",

Thus his words are clear and easily understood, his conduct easy to follow. His actions in righteousness can be made manifest to the people, and his plans and considerations can be communicated to ruler and ministers. Now Kong Qiu, with deep deliberation, conspired to serve a traitor; with exhaustive thought and all his knowledge, he acted perversely. He incited those below to disorder those above, teaching ministers to kill their ruler—this is not the conduct of a worthy man. Entering another’s state, he allied with that state’s traitors—this is not the kind that acts with rightness. Knowing a man to be disloyal, he hastened to aid him in rebellion—this is not the way of humanity and rightness. Fleeing others before plotting, avoiding others before speaking, his actions in righteousness cannot be made manifest to the people, his plans and considerations cannot be communicated to ruler and ministers. Your servant Ying sees no difference between Kong Qiu and Duke Bai, and so I did not respond.\"\n\nDuke Jing said: \"Alas! Many have deceived me. Were it not for you, Master, I would have gone my whole life without knowing that Kong Qiu was the same as Duke Bai.\"\n\nWhen Kong Qiu came to Qi, he had an audience with Duke Jing. The Duke was pleased and wished to enfeoff him at Nixi, so he informed Yanzi. Yanzi said: \"This cannot be. The Ru are idle and self-indulgent; they cannot be used to instruct those below. They delight in music and lead others astray; they cannot be made to govern closely. They establish fate and neglect affairs; they cannot be made to hold office. They venerate mourning and prolong grief; they cannot be made to show compassion to the people. They wear elaborate robes and force their demeanor; they cannot be made to guide the masses. Kong Qiu, with his grand appearance and meticulous adornments, bewitches the world. With strings and songs, drums and dances, he gathers disciples. With the elaborate rites of ascent and descent, he displays propriety. With the ostentatious steps of haste and circling, he impresses the crowd. Ru learning cannot be used to deliberate on the world; their exhausting thoughts cannot be put to use. Even a long life cannot exhaust their studies; in their prime, they cannot perform their rites. Accumulated wealth cannot satisfy their pleasures. With ornate and perverse arts, they scheme to ingratiate themselves with the ruler of the age. With grand music and entertainment, they corrupt the people. Their Way cannot be expected to last through the ages; their learning cannot be used to guide the masses. Now, my lord, if you enfeoff him, it will benefit Qi’s customs, but it will not serve to guide the state and lead the people.\"",

It does not dwell in unrighteousness, nor act against reason. It strives to advance the world’s benefit, adapting to circumstances, ceasing when benefit is achieved—this is the noble man’s Way. But what we have heard of Confucius’ conduct is fundamentally opposed to this.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi asked Yanzi: \"What sort of man is Confucius?\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the lord deferred the enfeoffment, receiving him with reverence yet never inquiring into his Way. Confucius, enraged at Duke Jing and Yanzi, then cultivated ties with Jiayi Zi and the gate of Tian Chang, informing Nanguo Huizi of his ambitions before returning to Lu. Soon after, hearing that Qi was about to invade Lu, he said to Zigong: \"Ci! The time to launch great affairs is now.\" He dispatched Zigong to Qi, where he met with Tian Chang through Nanguo Huizi, urging him to attack Wu and instructing Gao, Guo, Bao, and Yan to refrain from interfering with Tian Chang’s rebellion, while also encouraging Yue to attack Wu. Within three years, Qi and Wu were shattered by the calamity of war, their corpses piled high as the plains of Wei—this was the retribution for Confucius.\n\nWhen Confucius served as Minister of Justice in Lu, he abandoned the public good to side with the Ji family. The Ji clan coerced the ruler of Lu into exile, and when the Ji lord and the townspeople clashed at the city gate, the gate’s crossbar was torn down. Confucius was stranded between Cai and Chen, reduced to eating wild greens without grain, and after ten days, Zilu prepared a suckling pig for him. Confucius ate without asking where the meat had come from. Someone offered him a robe and fine wine, and he drank without inquiring into their origins.\n\nWhen the Lord of Chen welcomed Confucius, he would not sit unless the mat was properly aligned, nor eat unless the meat was cut correctly. Zilu approached and asked: \"Why does your conduct here differ so from that in Cai and Chen?\" Confucius replied: \"Come, let me tell you. Before, when we were desperate, we did not refuse ill-gotten means to survive. When sated, we feigned virtue to adorn ourselves—what greater deceit and depravity could there be?\"\n\nConfucius once sat with his disciples and remarked: \"When Shun approached his blind father, Gu Sou, was the world not in peril? Was the Duke of Zhou not a true man? Why then did he abandon his home and take refuge elsewhere?\" Confucius’s actions were the product of his heart’s machinations. His followers and disciples all emulated him: Zigong and Zilu aided Kong Li in Wei, Yang Hu sowed chaos in Qi, Fo Ban rebelled in Zhongmou, and they sought to carve up the land and maim the people—no greater harm could be done.\n\nFor disciples to succeed their masters, they must refine their words, model their conduct, and strive until their strength or wisdom is exhausted. Yet Confucius’s conduct was as described—how then can the Ru scholars not be doubted?",

To know that learning is without benefit is teaching; to teach that learning is without benefit is earnest. In debate and criticism, whether criticism is valid or not depends on the validity of the principle: if the principle can be criticized, even much criticism is correct; if the principle cannot be faulted, even little criticism is wrong. Now to claim that much criticism is invalid is like measuring length by shortness. Not criticizing is not criticizing oneself. Not faulting criticism is not faulting what can be faulted. What cannot be faulted is not faulting criticism. Things may be extremely long or extremely short, yet none are longer than this, none shorter than this—this is correctness. What is not this is nothing more incorrect than this. Taking high and low as the measure of good and not good is not as fitting as mountains and marshes. Dwelling in lowliness is better than dwelling in eminence, for the low is what the high requests. If not this, then this is both this and thus.

      "translated_text": "Master Mozi grew angry with Gengzhuzi. Gengzhuzi said, \"Am I not yet superior to others?\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Suppose I am about to ascend the Great Pass. I have a fine steed and a sheep to drive—whom should I urge on?\"\nGengzhuzi said, \"You should urge on the fine steed.\"\nMaster Mozi asked, \"Why urge on the fine steed?\"\nGengzhuzi replied, \"The fine steed is capable of bearing responsibility.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"I also consider you capable of bearing responsibility.\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"In wisdom and intelligence, how do ghosts and spirits compare to the sage?\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"The wisdom and intelligence of ghosts and spirits surpass that of the sage as keen ears and sharp eyes surpass the deaf and blind. Formerly, King Kai of the Xia sent Fei Lian to smelt metal from the mountains and rivers and cast it into tripods at Kunwu. He then had Xi Nan divine at Bai Ku’s altar, saying: 'When the tripod is complete, with three legs and square, it will cook without fire, store without lifting, and move without being carried. It shall be offered at the ruins of Kunwu, facing upward.' The diviner’s interpretation said: 'It shall be received.' White clouds gathered, now south, now north, now west, now east. Once the Nine Tripods were completed, they were passed among the Three States. The Xia lost them, the Yin received them; the Yin lost them, the Zhou received them. The transmission among the Xia, Yin, and Zhou lasted several hundred years. If sages were to gather their worthy ministers and their most astute advisors to deliberate, could they foresee events hundreds of years hence? Yet ghosts and spirits knew them. Thus it is said: the wisdom and intelligence of ghosts and spirits surpass that of the sage as keen ears and sharp eyes surpass the deaf and blind.\"\n\nZitu Yu and Xianzi Shuo asked Master Mozi, \"In practicing righteousness, what is the greatest task?\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"It is like building a wall. Those who can build, build; those who can carry earth, carry earth; those who can tamp, tamp. Only then is the wall completed. Practicing righteousness is the same. Those who can debate, debate; those who can expound the texts, expound the texts; those who can act, act. Only then is the work of righteousness accomplished.\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"You embrace all under Heaven with love, yet no benefit is seen; I do not love all under Heaven, yet no harm is seen. Neither of us has achieved results—why do you alone affirm yourself and negate me?\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Suppose there is a fire here. One person brings water to extinguish it, while another adds fuel to intensify it. Neither has yet achieved results—whom would you value between the two?\"\nWumazi said, \"I affirm the intention of the one bringing water and negate the intention of the one adding fuel.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"I likewise affirm my intention and negate yours.\"\n\nMaster Mozi sent Gengzhuzi to Chu. Several disciples visited him, offering only three measures of grain and treating him poorly as a guest. The disciples later said to Master Mozi, \"Gengzhuzi’s stay in Chu is of no benefit. Several of us visited him, gave him only three measures of grain, and treated him poorly.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"It is not yet certain.\" Before long, Gengzhuzi sent ten pieces of gold to Master Mozi, saying, \"Your disciple dares not die in vain. Here are ten pieces of gold—I wish you to use them.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"Truly, it was not yet certain.\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"In your practice of righteousness, people do not see you grow illustrious, ghosts do not see you grow rich, yet you persist in it. You must be mad.\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Suppose you had two servants here. One acts only when he sees you; when he does not see you, he does not act. The other acts whether he sees you or not. Which of the two would you value?\"\nWumazi said, \"I would value the one who acts whether he sees me or not.\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"Then you too value madness.\"\n\nA disciple of Zixia asked Master Mozi, \"Does the noble man have a state?\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"The noble man has no state.\"\nThe disciple of Zixia said, \"Even dogs and swine have a state—how can a scholar have no place?\"\nMaster Mozi said, \"Alas! Your words compare conduct to dogs and swine—alas!\"\n\nWumazi said to Master Mozi, \"To abandon the people of today and praise the Great Kings is to praise dry bones. It is like a carpenter who knows dry wood but not living wood.\"\nMaster Mozi replied, \"All under Heaven live by the Way of the Great Kings. To praise the Great Kings is to praise the source of life for all under Heaven. To be able to praise them and not do so is not virtuous.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said, \"The jade disk of He, the pearl of Marquis Sui, the Three Thorns and Six Rarities—these are what the feudal lords call fine treasures. Can they enrich the state, increase the people, govern punishments and policies, and secure the altars of soil and grain? It is said: they cannot. What makes fine treasures valuable is their ability to benefit. The jade disk of He, the pearl of Marquis Sui, the Three Thorns and Six Rarities cannot benefit people—they are not the fine treasures of all under Heaven. Now, if one governs the state with righteousness, the people will surely increase, punishments and policies will surely be well-ordered, and the altars of soil and grain will surely be secure. What makes fine treasures valuable is their ability to benefit the people. Righteousness can benefit people, so it is said: righteousness is the fine treasure of all under Heaven.\"\n\nLord Zigao of She asked Confucius about governance, saying, \"What is it like to govern well?\"\nConfucius replied, \"To govern well is to draw near those who are distant and renew those who are old.\"\nMaster Mozi, hearing this, said, \"Lord Zigao of She did not grasp his question, and Confucius did not grasp how to answer it.\"",

      "translated_text": "Lord Zigao of She surely knew that good governance draws near those who are distant and renews those who are old—so what did he truly ask? He asked *how* to do so. If one does not explain to others what they do not understand, but instead tells them what they already know, this is why Lord Zigao of She did not grasp his question, and Confucius did not grasp how to answer it.\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: \"When a great state attacks a small state, it is like a child playing at being a horse. When a child plays at being a horse, his legs are wearied by the effort. Now, when a great state attacks a small state, the attacking side’s farmers cannot plow, and their women cannot weave, for they must devote themselves to defense. The side under attack is likewise in chaos—its farmers cannot plow, and its women cannot weave, for they must devote themselves to the assault. Thus, when a great state attacks a small state, it is like a child playing at being a horse.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Words sufficient to be put into practice should be made constant; those sufficient to be acted upon should not be made constant. To make constant what is insufficient to be acted upon is to indulge in empty talk.\"\n\nMaster Mozi sent Guan Qianche to escort Gaoshi Zi to Wei. The Lord of Wei bestowed upon him a generous stipend and installed him in the countryside. Gaoshi Zi attended court three times and spoke exhaustively, yet none of his words were put into action. He left and went to Qi, where he saw Master Mozi and said: \"Because of you, the Lord of Wei bestowed upon me a generous stipend and installed me in the countryside. I attended court three times and spoke exhaustively, yet none of my words were put into action—this is why I left. Might the Lord of Wei now take me for a madman?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"If you left for the sake of the Dao, what harm is there in being called mad? In ancient times, the Duke of Zhou was not Guan Shu, yet he declined the Three Ducal Offices and remained in Shangyan. People all called him mad. Later generations praised his virtue, extolled his name, and it endures to this day. Moreover, I have heard that one who acts with righteousness does not avoid slander or seek praise. If you left for the sake of the Dao, what harm is there in being called mad?\"\n\nGaoshi Zi said: \"In leaving, how could I dare not act for the sake of the Dao? Formerly, you said: 'When the world is without the Dao, the humane scholar does not dwell in abundance.' Now the Lord of Wei is without the Dao, yet I coveted his stipend and rank—this would make me one who sinks others for personal gain.\"\n\nMaster Mozi was pleased and summoned Zi Qinzi, saying: \"Listen to this. I have always heard of those who turn their backs on righteousness to seek stipends, but in Gaoshi Zi, I have seen one who turns his back on stipends to seek righteousness.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"When the world’s vulgar gentlemen are poor, if you call them rich, they grow angry; if you say they lack righteousness, yet call them righteous, they rejoice. Is this not perverse?\"\n\nGong Mengzi said: \"Our ancestors had but three models.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Which ancestors do you mean when you say they had but three models? You do not understand that people had ancestors before them. If later generations turn against me, do I bear any fault? I turn against those who come after.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"This is like an army in retreat—would the stragglers seek rewards?\"\n\nGong Mengzi said: \"The gentleman does not create; he merely transmits.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Not so. Among those who are not gentlemen, in ancient times, the good were not suppressed, but today, the good do not arise. Among those of lesser quality who are not gentlemen, in ancient times, the good were not promoted, but if one had goodness oneself, one would put it into action, wishing goodness to arise from oneself. Now, to suppress and not put into action is no different from not promoting those who act. I hold that in ancient times, the good were suppressed, but today, the good should be put into action, so that goodness may increase.\"\n\nWuma Zi said to Master Mozi: \"You and I differ—I cannot practice universal love. I love the people of Zou more than those of Yue, the people of Lu more than those of Zou, the people of my village more than those of Lu, the people of my household more than those of my village, my kin more than the people of my household, and myself more than my kin, for they are closer to me. If someone strikes me, I feel pain; if they strike another, I do not feel their pain. Why should I feel distress when those close to me are not harmed, yet feel distress when those distant are harmed? Thus, I have myself and would kill others to preserve myself; I would not kill myself to benefit others.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Do you intend to conceal your doctrine, or will you proclaim it to others?\"\n\nWuma Zi said: \"Why would I conceal my doctrine? I will proclaim it to others.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"In that case, if one person approves of you, one person will want to kill you to benefit themselves; if ten people approve of you, ten people will want to kill you to benefit themselves; if the whole world approves of you, the whole world will want to kill you to benefit themselves. If one person disapproves of you, one person will want to kill you, taking you for one who spreads inauspicious words; if ten people disapprove of you, ten people will want to kill you, taking you for one who spreads inauspicious words; if the whole world disapproves of you, the whole world will want to kill you, taking you for one who spreads inauspicious words. Whether they approve of you or disapprove of you, they will want to kill you—this is what is called a mouth that brings constant calamity, a body that invites constant murder.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Do your words not seek benefit? If you speak without regard for benefit, it is empty talk.\"\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: \"Suppose there is a man here who, when offered fine sheep, oxen, and sacrificial animals, merely has someone cut and prepare them, and finds the meal more satisfying than any other.

      "translated_text": "Master Mozi said: \"Of all things in the world, none is more precious than righteousness. Suppose one were to say to another: 'I will give you caps and shoes, but I must sever your hands and feet—would you accept?' Surely one would not. Why? Because caps and shoes are not as precious as hands and feet. Or suppose one were to say: 'I will give you the world, but I must kill you—would you accept?' Again, one would surely not. Why? Because the world is not as precious as one’s own body. Yet men will contend to the death over a single word—this is to value righteousness above one’s own body. Thus it is said: Of all things in the world, none is more precious than righteousness.\"\n\nMaster Mozi, traveling from Lu to Qi, visited an old friend, who said to him: \"Nowadays, no one in the world practices righteousness. Why do you alone wear yourself out for it? You would do better to stop.\" Master Mozi replied: \"Suppose a man had ten sons, but only one tilled the fields while the other nine remained idle. The one who tilled would have to work all the harder. Why? Because many eat, but few cultivate. Now, when no one in the world practices righteousness, you should be urging me on, not trying to stop me.\"\n\nMaster Mozi journeyed south to Chu and was received by King Hui of Chu. The king, pleading age, sent Mu He to meet with him instead. Master Mozi spoke with Mu He, who was greatly pleased and said: \"Your words are truly excellent. Yet our lord is the greatest king in the world—would he not dismiss them as the work of a lowly man and refuse to adopt them?\" Master Mozi replied: \"It depends only on whether they can be put into practice. Consider medicine: the root of a common herb, if taken by the Son of Heaven, can cure his illness. Would he say, 'This is but the root of a common herb,' and refuse to take it? Now, when farmers pay their taxes to the great lords, the lords use them to prepare wine, sweet liquor, and fine grain offerings to sacrifice to the Lord on High and the spirits. Would they say, 'This is the work of lowly men,' and refuse to accept them? Thus, though a man may be lowly, when compared above to the farmer and below to the herb, is he not more valuable than the root of a common plant? Moreover, has your lord never heard the story of Tang? Long ago, when Tang was about to visit Yi Yin, he ordered the son of the Peng family to drive his carriage. Midway, the son asked: 'Where is my lord going?' Tang replied: 'I am going to visit Yi Yin.' The son said: 'Yi Yin is but a lowly man in the world. If my lord wishes to see him, he need only summon him for an audience, and Yi Yin would consider it an honor.' Tang replied: 'You do not understand.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Here the medicine is at hand—if one eats it, one’s ears grow sharper and one’s eyes brighter, so I would surely delight in it and force myself to take it. Now Yi Yin to our state is like a skilled physician or a potent medicine. Yet you would keep me from seeing Yi Yin—this is to wish me ill. Thereupon he dismissed the son of the Peng family and would not let him drive. Only when this was done could it be right.\n\nMaster Mozi said: In all words and deeds, whatever benefits Heaven, the spirits, and the common people, do; whatever harms Heaven, the spirits, and the common people, abandon. In all words and deeds, whatever accords with the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—do; whatever accords with the tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—abandon.\n\nMaster Mozi said: What is sufficient to guide conduct, make constant; what is insufficient to guide conduct, do not make constant. To make constant what is meant to guide conduct is to be glib.\n\nMaster Mozi said: One must rid oneself of the six biases. In silence, reflect; in speech, instruct; in action, serve. If one makes these three the charioteers of one’s three faculties, one will surely become a sage. One must rid oneself of joy, anger, pleasure, sorrow, and attachment, and employ only benevolence and righteousness. Let hands, feet, mouth, nose, and ears all be engaged in righteousness, and one will surely become a sage.\n\nMaster Mozi addressed his disciples: If one is committed to righteousness yet unable to fulfill it, one must not reject its Way. It is like a carpenter who measures but cannot cut—he must not reject his marking line.\n\nMaster Mozi said: The gentlemen of the world, when asked to govern a single hamlet, if unable, decline; yet when asked to serve as minister of a state, though unable, they accept. Is this not perverse?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Now suppose a blind man says, “What is large is white; what is black is dark.” Even one with keen eyesight could not correct him. But if you mix white and black and ask the blind man to choose, he cannot know. Thus when I say the blind man does not know white from black, it is not because of his words but because of his choice. Now the gentlemen of the world all name benevolence—even Yu and Tang could not improve upon it. Yet when benevolence and its opposite are mixed and the gentlemen of the world are asked to choose, they cannot know. Thus when I say the gentlemen of the world do not know benevolence, it is not because of their words but because of their choice.\n\nMaster Mozi said: Now in the use of one’s person, one is not as careful as a merchant with a single bolt of cloth. A merchant with a single bolt of cloth does not dare to weave carelessly but must choose the finest. Yet the scholar in the use of his person does otherwise: whatever his desires incline him to, he does. If his transgressions are grave, he incurs punishment; if slight, he suffers disgrace. Thus the scholar in the use of his person is not as careful as the merchant with a single bolt of cloth.\n\nMaster Mozi said: The gentlemen of the world wish their righteousness to be fulfilled yet resent others helping them cultivate their conduct. This is like wishing a wall to be built yet resenting others helping to construct it—is this not perverse?\n\nMaster Mozi said: The sage-kings of old wished to transmit their Way to later generations, so they wrote it on bamboo and silk, inscribed it on metal and stone, and passed it down to their descendants, wishing them to follow it. Now if one hears the legacy of the former kings yet does not act, this is to discard their transmission.\n\nMaster Mozi traveled south to the state of Wei, carrying many books in his cart. Xian Tangzi saw this and found it strange, saying: “Our Master taught Gong Shang Guo, ‘Estimate what is crooked and straight, and that is all.’ Now you carry so many books—what need is there?” Master Mozi said: “In the past, the Duke of Zhou read a hundred chapters in the morning and received seventy scholars in the evening. Thus the Duke of Zhou assisted the Son of Heaven, and his cultivation endures to this day. I above have no lord’s affairs to attend to, and below no farming hardships to endure—how dare I abandon this? I have heard that in matters of common purpose, there are often errors. Yet the people’s understanding is not uniform, which is why I carry many books. Now if one’s mind is like Guo’s, often contrary to what is subtle and refined, and in matters of common purpose one already knows the essentials, then one need not be taught with books. Why do you find this strange?”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Gong Liang Huanzi: “Wei is a small state, situated between Qi and Jin, like a poor family between rich ones. If a poor family imitates the rich in their lavish clothing and food, they will surely perish quickly. Now in your household, you adorn hundreds of carriages, feed hundreds of horses on beans and grain, and clothe hundreds of women in embroidered silks. If I took the expense of adorning carriages and feeding horses, along with the wealth spent on embroidered clothing, to support scholars, there would be enough for over a thousand. If disaster strikes, and you place a hundred men in front and several hundred behind, with hundreds of women before and after, which would be safer? I think supporting scholars is safer.”\n\nMaster Mozi served in Wei, but the one he served soon returned. Master Mozi asked: “Why have you returned?” The man replied: “He spoke to me insincerely. He said he would wait for me with a thousand measures, but gave me only five hundred, so I left.” Master Mozi said: “If he had given you more than a thousand measures, would you have left?” The man replied: “I would not.” Master Mozi said: “Then it was not because he was insincere but because he gave too little.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: The gentlemen of the world regard men of righteousness as less worthy than those carrying grain. Now suppose a man here, carrying grain, rests by the roadside, wanting to rise but unable. A gentleman sees him, regardless of age or status, and must help him up. Why? Because it is righteous.",

      "translated_text": "Now, when a gentleman acts for righteousness, revering and transmitting the Dao of the former kings to instruct others, even if they do not delight in it and put it into practice, they further slander and denigrate him. Thus, the gentlemen of the world regard men of righteousness as less worthy than those carrying grain.\n\nMaster Mozi said: Merchants travel in all four directions, their market prices shifting with trust and movement. Though they face the perils of passes and bridges, the dangers of bandits and thieves, they persist in their course. Yet when a scholar sits and speaks of righteousness, free from the perils of passes and bridges or the dangers of bandits and thieves—this is a matter of trust and movement beyond measure—yet they do not act. The calculation of profit by men of wealth is not as keen as that of merchants.\n\nMaster Mozi traveled north to Qi and encountered a diviner. The diviner said: “The Emperor will slay the black dragon in the north today, and your complexion is black—you must not go north.” Master Mozi paid no heed, proceeded north, and then returned. The diviner said: “I told you that you must not go north.” Master Mozi replied: “If southerners cannot go north and northerners cannot go south, and among them are those with black complexions and those with white, why do none succeed? Moreover, the Emperor slays the green dragon in the east on *jia-yi* days, the red dragon in the south on *bing-ding* days, the white dragon in the west on *geng-xin* days, and the black dragon in the north on *ren-gui* days. If we follow your words, we would forbid all movement below. This would constrict the heart and empty the world. Your words cannot be used.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “My words are sufficient for use. To abandon them and change one’s thoughts is like forsaking the harvest to cling to grain. To dismiss my words with contrary speech is like hurling eggs at a stone—even if all the eggs in the world were cast, the stone would remain unchanged, indestructible.”\n\n**Gong Meng, Forty-Eighth**\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “The gentleman holds himself in readiness; when questioned, he speaks, and when not questioned, he remains silent. It is like a bell: struck, it rings; left unstruck, it does not ring.” Master Mozi replied: “This saying contains three points, of which you now know only one, and even that, you do not fully understand. If a ruler indulges in licentious violence within the state, and one advances to remonstrate, it is called insolence; if one offers counsel through his attendants, it is called meddlesome speech. This is what perplexes the gentleman. If a ruler governs and the state faces peril, like a crossbow about to loose its bolt, the gentleman must remonstrate. Yet the ruler’s interest lies in such matters, so even if unprompted, the bell must ring. If a ruler undertakes unrighteous and aberrant conduct, even if he obtains a masterful strategy that could be employed in military campaigns to attack an innocent state, and he seizes upon it, he will surely use it. This expands territory and increases taxes and counterfeit wealth, but the outcome will bring disgrace. Neither the attacked nor the attacker benefits—both suffer harm. In such cases, even if unprompted, the bell must ring.\n\nMoreover, you say: ‘The gentleman holds himself in readiness; when questioned, he speaks, and when not questioned, he remains silent. It is like a bell: struck, it rings; left unstruck, it does not ring.’ Yet now, without being struck, you speak—does this mean you are the one who rings without being struck? Does this mean you are not a gentleman?”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “Truly good men—who does not know them? They are like fine jade, kept hidden yet brimming with inner essence. They are like beautiful women, secluded yet sought after by many. If they go forth and parade themselves, no one takes notice. Now you follow people closely and persuade them—why so laborious?”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “In this disordered age, those who seek beautiful women are many, and though the women do not go forth, people seek them in great numbers. Yet those who seek goodness are few. If one does not vigorously persuade others, no one will know. Consider two men of equal virtue here. One acts as a diviner for others, while the other remains secluded. Whose essence is greater?”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “The one who acts as a diviner for others has the greater essence.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Righteousness is the same. Those who go forth and persuade others achieve greater good. Why, then, do you not go forth and persuade others?”\n\nGong Mengzi, wearing a *zhangfu* cap, a *bohu* robe, and Confucian garb, came to see Master Mozi and said: “Does the gentleman first don his attire and then act, or does he act and then don his attire?”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “Action does not depend on attire.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “How do you know this?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “In ancient times, Duke Huan of Qi wore a tall hat and broad sash, a gold sword and wooden shield, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. Duke Wen of Jin wore coarse cloth and a sheepskin robe, a leather belt for his sword, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. King Zhuang of Chu wore a bright cap with braided tassels and a crimson robe, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. King Goujian of Yue cut his hair and tattooed his body, and governed his state—his state was well-governed. These four rulers differed in attire, yet their conduct was the same. From this, I know that action does not depend on attire.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “Well said. I have heard that dwelling on goodness brings misfortune. Let me set aside my *bohu* robe and change my *zhangfu* cap. May I see you again?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Please, let us meet as you are. If you must set aside your *bohu* robe and change your *zhangfu* cap before meeting me, then action truly depends on attire.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “The gentleman must speak the ancient language and wear ancient attire before he can be humane.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “In ancient times, King Zhou of Shang had his minister Fei Zhong, who were violent men in the world, while Jizi and Weizi were sages in the world. They spoke the same language, yet some were humane and others were not.”",

      "translated_text": "Master Zhou of Dan was a sage of the world, while Guan Shu was a violent man of the world—though they wore the same attire, one was humane and the other was not. Thus, it does not lie in ancient attire or ancient language.\n\nMoreover, you emulate the Zhou but not the Xia; your \"ancient\" is not truly ancient.\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “In the ranks of the ancient sage-kings, the most sagely stood as the Son of Heaven, and the next stood as ministers and grandees. Now, Confucius transmitted the *Odes* and *Documents*, examined ritual and music, and was versed in the myriad things. Had Confucius lived in the time of the sage-kings, would he not have been made Son of Heaven?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Wisdom requires revering Heaven, serving the spirits, loving others with frugality, and uniting these as knowledge. Now you say that because Confucius transmitted the *Odes* and *Documents*, examined ritual and music, and was versed in the myriad things, he could have been Son of Heaven—this is like counting a man’s teeth to determine his wealth.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “Poverty and wealth, long life and early death, are clearly ordained by Heaven and cannot be diminished or increased.” He added: “The gentleman must study.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “To teach people to study while holding to fate is like ordering someone to wear a hat while removing his hair.”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “There is right and wrong, but no auspicious or inauspicious omens.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The ancient sage-kings all regarded ghosts and spirits as divine, capable of bringing fortune or misfortune, and thus held to auspicious and inauspicious omens. This is how they governed and their states were secure. From Jie and Zhou onward, all regarded ghosts and spirits as undivine, incapable of bringing fortune or misfortune, and thus held to no auspicious or inauspicious omens. This is how their governance fell into chaos and their states were imperiled. The former kings’ writings, which you also possess, say: ‘Arrogance, issuing from you, is inauspicious.’ This means that doing evil incurs punishment, and doing good incurs reward.”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Gong Mengzi: “In mourning rites, when the lord, parents, wife, or eldest son dies, one wears three years of mourning; for paternal uncles, brothers, and cousins, one year; for clan members, five months; for aunts, sisters, maternal uncles, and nephews, several months of mourning. Yet some, when asked about not mourning, recite three hundred *Odes*, strum three hundred *Odes*, sing three hundred *Odes*, and dance three hundred *Odes*. If we follow your words, when will the gentleman have time to attend to governance? When will the common people have time to engage in their work?”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “When the state is in chaos, govern it; when governed, then perform ritual and music. When the state is well-governed, engage in work; when wealthy, then perform ritual and music.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “When the state is well-governed, if governance is abandoned, the state’s order will also be abandoned. When the state is wealthy, it is because of work; if work is abandoned, the state’s wealth will also be abandoned. Thus, even in a well-governed state, one must encourage without ceasing—only then is it possible. Now you say: when the state is well-governed, perform ritual and music; when in chaos, govern it. This is like digging a well when choking or seeking a physician when dead. The violent kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—indulged in music and song, heedless of their people. Thus, they were punished and executed, and their states became wastelands—all following this path.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “There are no ghosts or spirits.” Yet he also said: “The gentleman must study sacrificial rites.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Holding that there are no ghosts while studying sacrificial rites is like learning guest rites without guests, or weaving a fish net without fish.”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “You consider three years of mourning wrong, yet your three days of mourning are also wrong.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “For you to deem three years of mourning wrong while upholding three days of mourning is like calling someone who carries a child disrespectful.”\n\nGong Mengzi said to Master Mozi: “If one knows there is someone wiser than oneself, can this be called knowledge?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The foolish know there are those wiser than themselves, yet can the foolish be called wise?”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “Three years of mourning is learning to long for one’s parents.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The knowledge of an infant is merely to long for its parents. When parents cannot be obtained, it wails without ceasing—what is the reason for this? It is the height of foolishness. Then how can the Ru’s knowledge surpass that of an infant?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “I asked a Ru: ‘Why make music?’ He replied: ‘Music is for joy.’”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “You have not answered me. Now, if I ask: ‘Why build a house?’ and you say: ‘In winter to avoid the cold, in summer to avoid the heat, and to separate men and women,’ then you have told me the reason for building a house. But when I ask: ‘Why make music?’ and you say: ‘Music is for joy,’ this is like saying: ‘Why build a house?’ and answering: ‘A house is for a house.’”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Master Cheng: “The Ru’s Way is sufficient to ruin the world in four policies. The Ru regard the Dao as unclear and ghosts as undivine; Heaven and the spirits are displeased—this is sufficient to ruin the world. They also advocate lavish burials and prolonged mourning, with thick coffins, multiple layers of clothing, and sending off the dead as if relocating. They wail for three years, rise only with support, walk only with a staff, ears hearing nothing, eyes seeing nothing—this is sufficient to ruin the world. They further indulge in stringed songs and dances, practicing music—this is sufficient to ruin the world. They also hold that fate exists, that poverty and wealth, long life and early death, order and chaos, safety and danger are fixed and cannot be diminished or increased. If those above act accordingly, they will not govern; if those below act accordingly, they will not work—this is sufficient to ruin the world.”\n\nMaster Cheng said: “How severe is your condemnation of the Ru!”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The Ru fundamentally do not have these four policies; if I speak of them, then it is condemnation.”",
      "overlap_context": "us meet as you are. If you must set aside your *bohu* robe and change your *zhangfu* cap before meeting me, then action truly depends on attire.”\n\nGong Mengzi said: “The gentleman must speak the ancient language and wear ancient attire before he can be humane.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “In ancient times, King Zhou of Shang had his minister Fei Zhong, who were violent men in the world, while Jizi and Weizi were sages in the world. They spoke the same language, yet some were humane and others were not.”",

      "translated_text": "Now the Ru indeed possess these four policies, yet when I speak of them, it is not slander—it comes from what I have heard in contention. Master Cheng had no reply and departed.\n\nMaster Mozi said: “He is deluded.” Returning, he later sat down and resumed, saying: “Earlier, sir, your words contained points worth hearing. Yet if one follows your reasoning, it would mean neither praising Yu nor condemning Jie and Zhou.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Not so. To respond with fitting words, to weigh arguments and act accordingly—this is wisdom. If the attack is severe, my defense is severe; if the attack is slight, my defense is slight. To respond with fitting words and weigh arguments is like shouldering a yoke to strike at a moth.”\n\nMaster Mozi debated with Master Cheng, invoking Confucius. Master Cheng said: “You are not a Ru—why invoke Confucius?”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “This is a matter of what is fitting and cannot be altered. Now, when birds sense the distress of heat and drought, they fly high; when fish sense it, they dive deep. In such circumstances, even Yu or Tang, were they to devise a plan, could not alter this. Birds and fish may be called foolish, yet even Yu and Tang would still follow their nature. Now, have I never invoked Confucius?”\n\nA visitor to Master Mozi’s gate said to him: “Sir, you regard ghosts as spiritually enlightened and capable of bringing misfortune to people…”\n\nAnother visitor to Master Mozi’s gate, strong in body and keen in thought, wished to follow and study under him. Master Mozi said: “Study for now, and I will employ you.” He urged him with kind words to learn.\n\nA year later, the student demanded employment from Master Mozi. Master Mozi said: “I will not employ you. Have you not heard the saying from Lu? In Lu, there were five brothers. When their father died, the eldest son was fond of wine and refused to bury him. The four younger brothers said: ‘If you do not bury him, we will buy you wine.’ They urged him with kind words to bury their father. After the burial, he demanded wine from his four brothers. They replied: ‘We have not given you wine yet. You buried your father, and we buried ours—was ours alone to bury? If you did not bury him, others would have ridiculed you, so we urged you to do so. Now, you act with virtue, and we act with virtue—is ours alone to be virtuous? If you do not study, others will ridicule you, so we urge you to learn.’”\n\nAnother visitor to Master Mozi’s gate, when asked by Master Mozi, “Why not study?” replied: “None in my clan studies.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Not so. Does one who loves beauty say, ‘None in my clan loves it, so I do not’? Does one who desires wealth and honor not desire it? Those who love beauty and desire wealth and honor strive for them even against others’ example. Fortune favors the good and brings misfortune to the violent. Now, I have served you for a long time, yet fortune has not come. Perhaps your words contain some flaw? Or do ghosts and spirits lack clarity? Why have I not received fortune?”",

Have you heard of the punishment for concealing criminals?” The visitor replied: “I have not heard of it.” Master Mozi said: “Suppose there is a man here, and you have ten sons. Could you praise all ten while praising yourself just once?” The visitor replied: “I could not.” Master Mozi continued: “Or suppose there is a man here with a hundred sons. Could you praise them all your life while never praising yourself?” The visitor replied: “I could not.” Master Mozi said: “Concealing even one person is a crime. Now, the number you conceal is so great—you will incur a heavy punishment. How can you seek fortune?”\n\nMaster Mozi fell ill, and Die Bi approached to ask: “Master, you regard ghosts and spirits as clear, able to bring fortune and misfortune, rewarding the good and punishing the unvirtuous. Now, you are a sage—why are you ill? Perhaps your words contain some flaw? Or do ghosts and spirits lack clarity?” Master Mozi said: “Even if I am ill, how does that prove they are unclear? There are many ways one may fall ill: some from cold or heat, some from toil and hardship. If a house has a hundred doors but leaves one open, how can thieves not enter? The Way is the great vessel of the world—why must one force others to follow it?”\n\nSome of Master Mozi’s disciples who had returned to study archery said to him: “We wish to learn.” Master Mozi said: “You cannot. The wise must measure their strength and act only within their capacity. Even a warrior of the state, fighting while supporting another, cannot succeed. Now, you are not warriors of the state—how can you master learning and archery both?”\n\nThe disciples said to Master Mozi: “Gaozi says: ‘Your words uphold the Way, yet your conduct is deeply flawed.’ We ask to abandon you.” Master Mozi said: “You cannot. To cite my words while slandering my conduct is still better than having nothing. Suppose there is a man here—Di is deeply unvirtuous, yet he reveres Heaven, serves ghosts, and loves others. Though deeply unvirtuous, he is still better than having nothing. Now, Gaozi speaks eloquently, expounding on benevolence and the Way without slandering me. Even if Gaozi slanders you, he is still better than having nothing.”\n\nThe disciples said to Master Mozi: “Gaozi surpasses others in benevolence.” Master Mozi said: “It is not necessarily so. Gaozi’s benevolence is like a lame man claiming to be tall or a blind man claiming to be broad—it cannot last.” Gaozi said to Master Mozi: “I govern the state and administer its affairs.” Master Mozi said: “Governing requires speaking with the mouth and acting with the body.

      "translated_text": "#31 Wang Niansun, referencing the *Lu Wen* chapter and the *Taiping Yulan*, adds the character \"enter\" after \"follow.\" #32 From \"Now, as for righteousness\" to this point, the *Xian Gu* edition moves it below \"those who love beauty and desire wealth and honor do not look to others yet force themselves to act.\" #33 Bi Yuan notes that the characters \"slander you\" are inverted. #34 Bi Yuan emends \"lame\" to \"limb.\"\n\n**Scroll Thirteen of the Mozi: \"Lu’s Questions\" (Forty-Ninth Chapter)**\n\nThe Lord of Lu said to Master Mozi: “I fear Qi will attack us—can we be saved?”\nMaster Mozi said: “Yes. In ancient times, the sage-kings of the Three Dynasties—Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—were mere lords of a hundred *li*, yet through loyalty and righteous conduct, they won the world. The tyrannical kings of the Three Dynasties—Jie, Zhou, You, and Li—through arrogance, resentment, and violence, lost the world. I hope Your Lordship will, above, revere Heaven and serve the spirits, and below, love and benefit the people. Prepare generous gifts of furs and silk, humble your words, and present gifts to the neighboring lords on all sides. Placate the state and serve Qi—then the crisis can be averted. If not, I fear there will be nothing to be done.”\n\nWhen Qi was about to attack Lu, Master Mozi said to Xiang Ziniu: “To attack Lu is Qi’s great error. In the past, King Wu of Wu marched east to attack Yue, driving them to Mount Kuaiji; he marched west to attack Chu, forcing King Zhao into exile in Sui; he marched north to attack Qi, seizing the crown prince and returning to Wu. The feudal lords repaid his aggression, the people suffered under his labors, and refused to serve him. Thus his state was left desolate, and he himself met with execution. In the past, Zhibo attacked Fan and Zhonghang, annexing the lands of the Three Jin. The feudal lords repaid his aggression, the people suffered under his labors, and refused to serve him. Thus his state was left desolate, and he himself met with execution. Therefore, when a great state attacks a small state, it is mutual destruction—the transgression will inevitably rebound upon the state itself.”\n\nMaster Mozi said to the King of Qi: “Suppose there were a knife here, and you tested it on a man’s head, cutting cleanly through—would you call it sharp?”\nThe King said: “Sharp.”\nMaster Mozi said: “If you tested it on many heads, cutting cleanly through each time—would you call it sharp?”\nThe King said: “Sharp.”\nMaster Mozi said: “The knife is indeed sharp, but who will bear the misfortune?”\nThe King said: “The knife gains the benefit, but those who test it bear the misfortune.”\nMaster Mozi said: “To annex states, overthrow armies, and slaughter the people—who will bear the misfortune?”\nThe King lowered his head, pondered, and said: “I will bear the misfortune.”\n\nWhen Lord Wen of Luyang was about to attack Zheng, Master Mozi heard of it and stopped him, saying: “Suppose within the four borders of Lu, the great cities attacked the small cities, the great families raided the small families, killed the people, and seized their oxen, horses, dogs, pigs, cloth, silk, grain, and goods—what would you think?”\nLord Wen of Luyang said: “Within the four borders of Lu, all are my subjects. If the great cities attacked the small cities, the great families raided the small families, and plundered their goods, I would severely punish them.”\nMaster Mozi said: “Heaven encompasses all under Heaven, just as you encompass the four borders of your state. Now, if you raise troops to attack Zheng, would Heaven’s punishment not also be inevitable?”\nLord Wen of Luyang said: “Why do you stop me from attacking Zheng? My attack on Zheng accords with Heaven’s will. The people of Zheng have killed their fathers for three generations—Heaven has already punished them, making their state suffer for three years without recovery. I will assist Heaven in its punishment.”\nMaster Mozi said: “The people of Zheng have killed their fathers for three generations, and Heaven has punished them, making their state suffer for three years without recovery. Heaven’s punishment is sufficient. Now, if you raise troops to attack Zheng, saying, ‘My attack on Zheng accords with Heaven’s will,’ it is like this: Suppose a man’s son is violent and unfilial, so his father beats him. Then the neighbor’s father takes up a club and strikes him, saying, ‘I strike him in accord with his father’s will’—would this not be perverse?”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: “When you attack a neighboring state, kill its people, and seize its oxen, horses, grain, and goods, you record it on bamboo and silk, engrave it on metal and stone, cast it as an inscription on bells and tripods, and pass it down to later generations, saying: ‘None surpass us in greatness.’ Now, if a lowly man were to attack his neighbor’s household, kill its people, and seize its dogs, pigs, food, clothing, and furs, and also record it on bamboo and silk, inscribe it on ritual vessels, and pass it down to later generations, saying: ‘None surpass me in greatness’—would this be acceptable?”\nLord Wen of Luyang said: “From your words, I see that what the world calls acceptable may not necessarily be so.”\n\nMaster Mozi said to Lord Wen of Luyang: “The gentleman of the world today knows small things but not great things. Suppose there were a man here who stole a dog or a pig—you would call him unrighteous. But if he stole a state or a city, you would call it righteous. It is like seeing a small white thing and calling it white, but seeing a large white thing and calling it black. Thus the gentleman of the world knows small things but not great things—this is what such words describe.”\n\nLord Wen of Luyang said to Master Mozi: “South of Chu there is a state called Qiao where they eat people. When the eldest son is born, they butcher and eat him, calling it ‘fitting for the younger brother.’ If the child is beautiful, they present him to their lord, and if the lord is pleased, he rewards the father. Is this not a vile custom?”\nMaster Mozi said: “Even in the customs of the Central States, it is the same. To kill a father and reward his son—how is this different from eating one’s son and rewarding his father? If one does not employ benevolence and righteousness, how can one condemn the barbarians for eating their children?”",
      "overlap_context": "a lame man claiming to be tall or a blind man claiming to be broad—it cannot last.” Gaozi said to Master Mozi: “I govern the state and administer its affairs.” Master Mozi said: “Governing requires speaking with the mouth and acting with the body. Now, you speak with your mouth but do not act with your body—this is disorder in yourself. If you cannot govern yourself, how can you govern the state’s affairs? Withdraw for now; your own self is in disorder.” Thus concludes Scroll Twelve of the Mozi.",

      "translated_text": "When the jade-worker of the Lord of Lu died, the Lord of Lu executed the one responsible, and the people of Lu praised and followed this example. Master Mozi heard of this and said: “Execution is meant to fulfill the will of the dead. Now, to follow praise and adopt it is like taking a severed head as a model for submission.”\n\nLord Wen of Luyang said to Master Mozi: “Someone told me of a loyal minister—when ordered to bow, he bows; when ordered to look up, he looks up. When at rest, he is still; when called, he responds. Can this be called a loyal minister?”\nMaster Mozi said: “When ordered to bow, he bows; when ordered to look up, he looks up—this is like a shadow. When at rest, he is still; when called, he responds—this is like an echo. What benefit will you derive from a shadow or an echo? What I call a loyal minister is one who, when his lord has faults, subtly admonishes him; when he himself has virtues, he offers them to his lord without boasting. Outwardly, he conceals his lord’s errors and brings forth his lord’s virtues, elevating them without aligning below. Thus, goodness and excellence reside above, while grievances and complaints remain below; comfort and joy belong to the lord, while sorrow and hardship fall to the minister. This is what I call a loyal minister.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu said to Master Mozi: “I have two sons—one loves learning, the other loves distributing wealth to others. Which should I make heir?”\nMaster Mozi said: “It is not yet clear. Sometimes what is rewarded may not be right. Jie’s reverence was not for bestowing fish; the mantis hunts insects, not out of love. I wish my lord would examine their intentions and achievements together.”\n\nA man of Lu sent his son to study under Master Mozi. The son died in battle, and the father reproached Master Mozi.\nMaster Mozi said: “You wanted your son to study under me. Now he has completed his studies, died in battle, and you are angry—this is like wanting to be admired, then resenting admiration when it comes. Is this not misguided?”\n\nIn the southern borderlands of Lu, there was a man named Wu Lü who made pottery in winter and farmed in summer, comparing himself to Shun. Master Mozi heard of him and went to see him.\nWu Lü said to Master Mozi: “Virtue, virtue—what need is there for words?”\nMaster Mozi said: “What you call virtue—do you also labor to aid others and share your wealth with them?”\nWu Lü said: “I do.”\nMaster Mozi said: “I have calculated this. Suppose I farmed enough to feed the world—even at my most productive, it would equal the work of one farmer. Dividing this among the world, each person would get no more than a pint of grain. Even if they gained a pint, it would not satisfy the world’s hunger—this is already clear. Suppose I wove enough to clothe the world—even at my most productive, it would equal the work of one woman. Dividing this among the world, each person would get no more than a foot of cloth. Even if they gained a foot, it would not warm the world’s cold—this is already clear. Suppose I donned armor, took up weapons, and rescued the lords from peril—even at my strongest, I would be but one warrior. One warrior cannot withstand three armies—this is already clear. Therefore, I believe it is better to recite the Dao of the former kings, seek their teachings, understand the words of the sages, and examine their expressions. First, persuade the kings, dukes, and great men; next, the common people and humble scholars. If the kings, dukes, and great men use my words, the state will surely be well-governed. If the common people and humble scholars use my words, their conduct will surely be refined. Thus, though I do not farm, I feed the hungry; though I do not weave, I clothe the cold. My merit surpasses that of those who farm to feed and weave to clothe. Therefore, though I do not farm or weave, my merit surpasses that of farming and weaving.”\n\nWu Lü said to Master Mozi: “Virtue, virtue—what need is there for words?”\nMaster Mozi said: “If the world did not know how to farm, and I taught them to farm, would my merit be greater than if I farmed alone?”\nWu Lü said: “Teaching others to farm would bring greater merit.”\nMaster Mozi said: “If I attacked an unrighteous state, beating the drum to lead the masses into battle, would my merit be greater than if I fought alone without drumming?”\nWu Lü said: “Leading the masses into battle would bring greater merit.”\nMaster Mozi said: “If the common people and humble scholars of the world, though few understand virtue, teach the world about virtue, their merit would also be great. Why not speak of it? If you could drum and advance toward virtue, would my virtue not progress further?”\n\nMaster Mozi sent Gong Shangguo to Yue. Gong Shangguo persuaded the King of Yue, who was greatly pleased and said to him: “If you can bring Master Mozi to Yue to instruct me, I will cede a territory of five hundred *li* from the former lands of Wu to enfeoff Master Mozi.”\nGong Shangguo agreed. He then prepared fifty chariots to welcome Master Mozi from Lu, saying: “I used your master’s Dao to persuade the King of Yue. The king was greatly pleased and said to me, ‘If you can bring Master Mozi to Yue to instruct me, I will cede a territory of five hundred *li* from the former lands of Wu to enfeoff him.’”\nMaster Mozi said to Gong Shangguo: “What do you make of the King of Yue’s intentions? If he will listen to my words and employ my Dao, then I will go. I will eat according to my hunger and dress according to my size, comparing myself to a humble servant—how could I accept an enfeoffment? But if Yue will not listen to my words or employ my Dao, and I go anyway, then I would be displaying virtue for show. Such display is the same in the Central States—why must it be in Yue?”\n\nMaster Mozi traveled, and Wei Yue asked: “Having met with the lords of the four directions, with whom will you speak first?”\nMaster Mozi said: “When entering a state, one must choose the most pressing matters and attend to them.”",

      "translated_text": "When a state is benighted and disordered, speak to it of exalting the worthy and unifying standards. When a state is impoverished, speak to it of frugality in expenditures and funerals. When a state is steeped in music and debauchery, speak to it of rejecting music and denying fate. When a state is licentious, perverse, and without ritual, speak to it of revering Heaven and serving the spirits. When a state is bent on aggression and domination, speak to it of universal love and condemning warfare. Thus does one “choose the most pressing matters and attend to them.”\n\nMaster Mozi departed to serve Duke Cao’s son and returned to Song after three years. Gazing at Master Mozi, he said: “When first I studied at your gate, I wore coarse cloth and ate plain broth. If I received food in the morning, I might not have it by evening, yet I still made offerings to the spirits. But under your governance, my household has grown prosperous from its beginnings. Though prosperous, I have scrupulously made offerings to the spirits. Yet my retainers die in great numbers, my livestock do not multiply, and I am mired in illness. I do not see how your Way can be put to use.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “It is not so. The spirits desire many things from men. They desire that those in high office and with generous emoluments yield them to the worthy, and that those with abundant wealth share it with the poor. Do the spirits desire only the plucking of scallions and the offering of lungs? Now you occupy high office and receive generous emoluments, yet you do not yield them to the worthy—this is one inauspicious sign. You have abundant wealth, yet you do not share it with the poor—this is a second inauspicious sign. You serve the spirits with nothing more than offerings, and then ask, ‘Why has illness befallen me?’ This is like closing only one of a hundred gates and asking, ‘How could thieves have entered?’ Seeking blessings from spirits so offended—how could it be possible?”\n\nThe Lu invocators offered a single piglet in sacrifice and sought a hundred blessings from the spirits. When Master Mozi heard of this, he said: “This cannot be. If one gives little to others yet expects much in return, others will only fear that one might bestow something upon them. Now you offer a single piglet and seek a hundred blessings from the spirits—you should fear that they will demand oxen and sheep in sacrifice. The sage-kings of old served the spirits with nothing more than offerings. Now you offer a piglet and seek a hundred blessings—your wealth would be better spent in poverty.”\n\nPeng Qingshengzi said: “The past can be known, but the future cannot.” Master Mozi said: “Suppose your parents were a hundred *li* away and you learned they had encountered danger, with only a day to reach them. If you arrived in time, they would live; if not, they would die. Now suppose you had a sturdy carriage and fine horses here, and also a broken-down cart and a team of four worn-out nags. If you had to choose, which would you take?” Peng Qingshengzi replied: “I would take the fine horses and sturdy carriage to arrive quickly.” Master Mozi said: “Then why doubt what lies ahead?”\n\nMeng Shan praised Prince Wen of Wu, saying: “When the disaster of Duke Bai befell him, the duke seized Prince Wen and pressed an axe and iron hook to his waist, pointing a spear at his heart. He said, ‘Become king, and you will live; refuse, and you will die.’ Prince Wen replied, ‘How you insult me! You killed my kin and now offer me the state of Chu in delight. Even if I gained the world by such means, it would be unrighteous—I would not do it. How much less would I accept the state of Chu?’ And so he refused. Was Prince Wen not humane?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “It was difficult, yet not truly humane. If he believed the king was without the Way, why did he not accept the throne and govern? If he believed Duke Bai was unrighteous, why did he not accept the kingship, execute Duke Bai, and restore the king? Thus I say it was difficult, yet not truly humane.”\n\nMaster Mozi sent Sheng Chuo to serve Xiang Ziniu. Xiang Ziniu thrice invaded Lu territory, and Sheng Chuo thrice followed him. When Master Mozi heard of this, he sent Gao Sunzi to request his return, saying: “I sent Chuo to assist in curbing arrogance and correcting transgressions. Now Chuo enjoys generous emoluments and deceives his master. His master thrice invades Lu, and Chuo thrice follows—this is like whipping a horse to make it bolt. I have heard that to speak of righteousness yet not practice it is to defy enlightenment. Chuo is not ignorant of this; his emoluments have overcome his sense of right.”\n\nFormerly, the men of Chu and Yue fought on the river in boats. The men of Chu advanced with the current and retreated against it; when they saw an advantage, they advanced, and when they saw no advantage, they retreated to avoid difficulty. The men of Yue advanced against the current and retreated with it; when they saw an advantage, they advanced, and when they saw no advantage, they retreated swiftly. Thus the men of Yue, though outmatched, encircled and defeated the men of Chu.\n\nGongshuzi traveled south from Lu to Chu and first devised implements for naval warfare. He made hooks and crossbows: those who retreated were hooked, and those who advanced were repelled. Measuring the length of the hooks and crossbows, he designed weapons accordingly. The men of Chu were disciplined, while the men of Yue were not, so the men of Chu, though outmatched, encircled and defeated the men of Yue.\n\nGongshuzi, pleased with his ingenuity, said to Master Mozi: “In naval warfare, I have hooks and crossbows. I wonder if your righteousness also has hooks and crossbows?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “The hooks and crossbows of my righteousness surpass yours in naval warfare. My hooks and crossbows hook with love and repel with reverence. Without hooking with love, there is no intimacy; without repelling with reverence, there is haste. Familiarity without intimacy leads to swift estrangement. Thus mutual love and mutual reverence are like mutual benefit. Now you hook to restrain others, and others hook to restrain you; you repel others with force, and others repel you with force. Mutual hooking and mutual repelling are like mutual harm. Thus the hooks and crossbows of my righteousness surpass yours in naval warfare.”\n\nGongshuzi carved bamboo and wood into a magpie, which flew for three days without descending. Gongshuzi considered himself supremely skillful. Master Mozi said to him: “Your making of a magpie is not as good as my making of a linchpin. In an instant, I can carve a piece of wood three *cun* long and bear a weight of fifty *dan*.”",
      "overlap_context": "my size, comparing myself to a humble servant—how could I accept an enfeoffment? But if Yue will not listen to my words or employ my Dao, and I go anyway, then I would be displaying virtue for show. Such display is the same in the Central States—why must it be in Yue?”\n\nMaster Mozi traveled, and Wei Yue asked: “Having met with the lords of the four directions, with whom will you speak first?”\nMaster Mozi said: “When entering a state, one must choose the most pressing matters and attend to them.”",

      "translated_text": "Thus, what is called \"skillful\" is that which benefits others; what does not benefit others is called \"clumsy.\"\n\nGongshuzi said to Master Mozi: “Before I met you, I desired to take Song. After meeting you, though Song is offered to me, if it is unrighteous, I will not take it.”\n\nMaster Mozi replied: “Before I met you, you desired to take Song. After I met you, though I offer Song to you, if it is unrighteous, you refuse to take it—this is as if I have given Song to you. If you devote yourself to righteousness, I will further grant you the world.”\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nGongshu Ban constructed cloud-ladders for Chu, and upon their completion, intended to attack Song. Master Mozi, hearing of this, set out from Qi, traveling ten days and nights until he reached Ying, where he met Gongshu Ban.\n\nGongshu Ban asked: “What instructions do you bring, Master?”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “In the north, there is one who insults me. I wish to borrow your strength to kill him.”\n\nGongshu Ban was displeased.\n\nMaster Mozi said: “I offer ten *jin* of gold.”\n\nGongshu Ban replied: “By my principles, I fundamentally do not kill people.”\n\nMaster Mozi rose and bowed twice, saying: “Allow me to explain. I have come from the north and heard that you are constructing ladders to attack Song. What crime has Song committed? Chu has surplus land but insufficient people. To kill those who are insufficient while contending for what is already in surplus cannot be called wisdom. To attack Song, which is innocent, cannot be called benevolence. To know this and not remonstrate cannot be called loyalty. To remonstrate and fail cannot be called strength. To refrain from killing the few yet kill the many cannot be called understanding categories.”\n\nGongshu Ban was convinced.\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Then, will you cease?”\n\nGongshu Ban replied: “I cannot. I have already spoken of this to the king.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Why not introduce me to the king?”\n\nGongshu Ban agreed.\n\nMaster Mozi met the king and said: “Suppose there is a man here who, possessing a fine carriage, covets his neighbor’s shabby robe; who, having millet and meat, covets his neighbor’s husks and dregs. What sort of man would this be?”\n\nThe king said: “He must have a thieving sickness.”\n\nMaster Mozi said: “Chu’s territory spans five thousand *li*—this is like the fine carriage compared to a broken cart. Chu has Yunmeng, filled with rhinoceroses, deer, and elk; the Jiang and Han rivers teem with fish, soft-shelled turtles, and alligators, making it the richest in the world. Song, by contrast, has no pheasants, hares, or foxes—this is like millet and meat compared to husks and dregs. Chu has tall pines, patterned catalpas, *geng* and *ge* trees, and camphorwood, while Song has no tall trees—this is like brocade compared to a shabby robe. For Your Majesty to attack Song on these three counts is of the same kind as the man I described.”\n\nThe king said: “Well said! Nevertheless, Gongshu Ban has made cloud-ladders for me, and I must take Song.”\n\nThereupon, Master Mozi met Gongshu Ban again. He untied his belt to represent a city wall and used a wooden tablet as a weapon. Gongshu Ban deployed nine variations of siege engines, and Master Mozi countered each one. When Gongshu Ban’s offensive tools were exhausted, Master Mozi’s defensive measures still had surplus.\n\nGongshu Ban, frustrated, said: “I know how to counter you, but I will not speak of it.”\n\nMaster Mozi likewise said: “I know how you intend to counter me, but I will not speak of it.”\n\nThe king of Chu asked the reason. Master Mozi said: “Gongshu Ban’s intent is merely to kill me. If I am killed, Song will have no one to defend it and can be attacked. However, my disciple Qin Guli and three hundred others are already holding my defensive tools, awaiting the Chu invaders atop Song’s walls. Even if you kill me, you cannot exterminate them.”\n\nThe king of Chu said: “Well said! I will not attack Song.”\n\nMaster Mozi returned, passing through Song. It rained, and he took shelter in a gateway, but the gatekeepers would not admit him. Thus it is said: Those who govern with spirit are unknown to the multitude for their merit; those who contend in the open are known to all.\n\n**End of Scroll Thirteen of the Mozi**",

      "translated_text": "Qin Guli asked Master Mozi: \"According to the words of the sages, when the phoenix and crow do not appear, the feudal lords rebel against the states of Yin and Zhou, and armor and weapons arise throughout the world—great states attack small ones, the strong seize the weak. If I wish to defend a small state, what should be done?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"What kind of attack are you defending against?\"\n\nQin Guli replied: \"In the present age, the common methods of attack are: scaling ladders, grappling hooks, battering rams, siege towers, smoke, flooding, *kang*¹, *yuan*², tunnels, ant-like assaults, rolling logs, and chariots. How does one defend against these twelve methods?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said: \"Repair the city moat, prepare the defensive implements, store sufficient grain, ensure harmony between superiors and subordinates, and secure aid from neighboring feudal lords—this is how one endures. Yet even if the defenders are skilled, if the ruler does not employ them properly, it is as if the city cannot be defended. If the ruler appoints defenders but they lack ability, and the ruler still relies on them, it is as if the city cannot be defended. Thus, defenders must be both skilled and honored by the ruler before the city can be held.\n\nNow, the methods of defending a city: for the city gates, suspend *xian*⁵ mechanisms—twenty feet long and eight feet wide, with two matching sides. The crossbars⁶ should be spaced three inches apart, and earth should be packed above them, no more than two inches thick. The trench should be fifteen feet deep, its width matching the gate’s span, its length determined by available labor. At the trench’s end, suspend a basket large enough for one person. When it is full, bore holes in all gates and doors. Prepare *zi*⁸ for each: two covers, each with two layers, one bored and tied with a four-foot rope.\n\nTo counter fire chariots, shoot flaming arrows at the city gates. Bore holes in the gates to create a scaffold, plaster it, and hold water-soaked hemp ropes⁹. Use grass¹⁰ baskets to extinguish fires. Thinly reinforce the gate planks, boring holes half a foot deep, one inch apart, inserting *yi*¹¹ pegs two inches long, with one inch exposed, spaced seven inches apart, and thickly plaster them to resist fire. For each gate, suspend a water vessel to douse fires, with capacities ranging from three *dan* upward, varying in size.\n\nThe gate’s vertical posts and crossbars must be encircled with metal bands, secured with molten bronze or iron. The gate’s locking mechanism should be double-layered, reinforced with iron to ensure strength. For the bolt, make it two feet long, and the locking bar one *xian* thick. Seal it with the guard’s seal, and have someone regularly inspect the seal’s condition and the depth of the locking hole. Gatekeepers must not carry axes, adzes, chisels, saws, or mallets.\n\nOn the city walls, place a *qu* every two paces—a vertical post thirteen feet tall, with a ten-foot crossbar¹², and a six-foot shield. Every two paces, set up a *da*, nine feet wide and twelve feet long¹³. Every two paces, place one each of a long staff, long axe, and long mallet, along with twenty spears, distributed at two-pace intervals. Every two paces, station a wooden crossbow, capable of shooting over fifty paces. Prepare many arrows, avoiding bamboo shafts; *hu*, *zhao*, *pi*, and elm are acceptable. Seek iron arrowheads from Qi, and use them to shoot at enemy scaling hooks and siege towers.\n\nEvery two paces, pile stones weighing at least one *jun*, five hundred in total. If fewer, use *kang* siege plows and *bi* shields, all well-made. Every two paces, stack twenty large bamboo hats, each a full armspan in circumference and ten feet long. Every five paces, place a jar for water, with a ladle holding one *dou*. Every five paces, pile five hundred *gou shi* (dog corpses), each three feet long, tied with hemp, their ends sharpened and firmly bound. Every ten paces, stack twenty *bo* logs, each over two armspans in circumference and eight feet long.\n\nEvery twenty-five paces, set up a *#14* with an iron trough capable of holding one *dan* of stones, prepared for boiling water. Also keep sand, no less than one thousand *dan*. Every thirty paces, erect a watchtower, extending four feet beyond the parapet, three feet wide, four feet long, with planks on three sides, tightly sealed, and covered in summer. Every fifty paces, place a *jie* chariot, its wheels fitted with iron hubcaps. Every fifty paces, build a well enclosure, walled eight feet high. Every fifty paces, establish a square stronghold, secured with locks and keys. Every fifty paces, stack firewood, no less than three hundred *dan*, well covered with plaster to prevent external fire from igniting it.\n\nEvery hundred paces, construct a *long cong* siege tower, rising five *zhang* from the ground, three stories high, its base eight feet wide at the front and thirteen at the rear, tapering upward proportionally. Every hundred paces, build a wooden tower, nine feet wide at the front and seven feet high, with its axle positioned at the parapet, extending twelve feet beyond the wall. Every hundred paces, set up two *#15* and twenty *yong*, using wood to make connected striking devices.\n\nStore one hundred water vessels, each holding four *dou* to six *shi*¹⁶. Every hundred paces, pile fifty bundles of miscellaneous stalks, each over two armspans in circumference. Every hundred paces, erect a *lu* shield, four feet wide and eight feet tall. Prepare *chong shu* (battering ram techniques). Every hundred paces, place one thousand *you du* (hidden shields), three feet wide and four feet tall.\n\nEvery two hundred paces, build a watchtower within the city, twenty-five feet two inches wide and twenty feet long, extending five feet beyond the wall’s pivot.

Every fifty paces, construct a latrine identical to those below. Those using the latrine must not carry weapons. Every thirty paces on the wall, place a *jie che* (mobile barricade cart), though it shall not be used by those in formation. Every fifty paces, build a rampway two feet five inches high and ten paces long. Every fifty paces, construct a *lou luan* (turret platform), ensuring the bolts and braces are sturdy and reinforced.\n\nEvery hundred paces, build a *shi lou* (watchtower), with its outer gate opening outward and flanked by drainage channels. For the tower, add a *jie mu* (protective screen) and extend a *zhan* (scaffold) outward to aid external defense. No chambers may be built on the wall; any structures that could provide concealment must be entirely removed. Within the inner roads at the city’s base, every hundred paces, store *ji* (straw bundles); no stockpile should hold less than three thousand *dan*, and they must be well-coated. On the wall, every ten men shall have a *shizhang* (squad leader), subordinate to one officer, one *bo wei* (cloth-armored captain).\n\nEvery hundred paces, construct a *ting* (guard post) with walls fourteen feet high and four feet thick, featuring double-leaf gates that can be secured from within. The *ting wei* (post captain) must be selected from those of orderly conduct, loyalty, trustworthiness, and competence. Two encampments share one well for cooking. Ash, chaff, firewood, fodder, and horse blankets must all be carefully stored.\n\nDefensive preparations on the wall include: *qu zhan* (drainage channels and screens), *ji che* (mobile barricades), *xing zhan* (mobile scaffolds), *xing lou* (mobile towers), *dao* (scaling ladders), *he gao* (crane-like siege engines), *lian ting* (linked shields), long axes, long hammers, long chisels, *ju* (hooked poles), *fei chong* (flying assault bridges), *xuan kou* (suspended hooks), and *pi qu* (battering rams).\n\nEvery fifty paces, build a tower with a *que nei* (sparrow’s nest) beneath the parapet. Every three feet, place a *xin gao* (firewood rack), ensuring each is two spans in circumference and four and a half feet long, with clean fuel. For tiles and stones: those weighing over two *sheng* are suitable. On the wall, every fifty paces, stockpile *she* (missile ammunition). Place iron grapnels alongside them in the same location.\n\nFor timber: logs two spans in circumference and twelve feet long or longer must have their bases well-trimmed, called *chang cong* (long supports); thirty are needed every fifty paces. Wooden bridges should be three *zhang* long, no fewer than fifty in number. When urgent repairs are required, construct a *lei bi* (rampart wall) and cover it with tiles afterward. Use ceramic jars holding ten *sheng* or more, ten every fifty paces, to store water for immediate use. Fifty-two of these are to be placed every ten paces.\n\nAt the four corners of the city wall, build high *mo si* (observation platforms) with reinforced chambers below, where observers shall stand to monitor the enemy’s movements. They must report the enemy’s formations, advances, retreats, and shifts in position; failure to do so results in execution. If the enemy digs tunnels inward, dispatch tunnel engineers to counter by digging around them, and prepare crossbows inside to respond.\n\nGather from the people’s homes any pestles, timber, tiles, or stones that can be used for city defenses and bring them up to the wall.

      "translated_text": "Otherwise, the terrain is difficult to assault yet easy to defend.\n\nOtherwise, there are deep grievances against the enemy and great merit before the ruler.\n\nOtherwise, rewards are clear and trustworthy while punishments are severe and sufficiently dreaded.\n\nWithin the city wards, households must each maintain defenses to the left, right, front, and rear, as on the city walls.\n\nIf the city is small but the populace large, relocate the elderly and weak from the outskirts into the city or a larger stronghold.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches and their assault is certain, the defenders shall first strip the city’s outer palisades, but do not burn them. While the enemy is at the walls, rotate officers and soldiers at their posts, yet do not replace the laborers; laborers must not ascend the walls.\n\nWhen the enemy is at the walls, herd all livestock into enclosures and inspect them. Plow and stockpile grain at the city’s base, one stockpile every hundred paces, each containing five hundred measures.\n\nNo buildings shall stand within the city gates. Establish a circular administrative hall for officials, with a four-foot parapet. The inner walkways shall be enclosed, secured with two crossbars and one bolt.\n\nBeyond the city’s open ground, a hundred paces from the moat, all walls, fences, trees—large and small—must be demolished and removed. Clear them away.\n\nWherever the enemy may advance—whether along narrow paths or near the city’s open ground—construct watchtowers. Erect bamboo poles at the center of the sky.\n\nBuild a great tower in the hall’s courtyard, high enough to overlook the city. The courtyard shall be open on all sides, with pathways to receive visitors. When guests await an audience, summon the three elders and left-guard officials from within to deliberate. What is to be done?\n\nMaster Mozi said: Are you asking about the defense against tunnelers?\n\nTo prepare against tunneling, construct high towers within the city for vigilance.\n\nWhen these fourteen measures are fully implemented, the people will no longer be inclined to ascend the walls. Only then can the city be defended. If even one of the fourteen is lacking, even the most skilled defenders cannot hold it.\n\n**Defense Regulations:**\nFor every fifty paces, assign ten adult men, twenty able-bodied women, and ten elderly or children—totaling forty people per fifty paces. At the base of the city walls, station one person per pace, twenty people every twenty paces. Scale these numbers according to the city’s size to ensure sufficient defense.\n\nIf the defenders press forward like a swarming ant formation, the enemy will be forewarned, and the advantage will lie with the defenders while the attackers suffer.\n\nWhen the enemy attacks in force—with a host of a hundred thousand—they shall not advance in more than four divisions. The upper guard covers five hundred paces, the middle formation three hundred, and the lower guard fifty. For any front narrower than a hundred and five paces, the defenders gain the advantage while the attackers falter.\n\nA five-hundred-pace front requires a thousand adult men, two thousand able-bodied women, and a thousand elderly or children—totaling four thousand to meet the assault. These are the numbers for defense and guard duty. Assign the elderly and children who cannot fight to guard positions on the walls not directly engaged.\n\nWhen troops depart the city, they must carry clear markers. Ensure all officers and civilians are aware of this. Any group of one hundred or more leaving without proper markers, or accompanied by unfamiliar persons, shall be treated as suspicious. Commanders of a thousand or more must halt such groups and prevent their departure. If officers or soldiers accompany them, all shall be executed, and the matter reported to the authorities. This is a critical prohibition in city defense, for it is where treachery arises—it must be scrutinized without fail.\n\n**Scouting the Enemy:**\nWatch for enemy movements. If the enemy behaves unusually—erecting walls, piling earth, or if water in wells turns unusually turbid—these are signs of tunneling. Immediately reinforce the city’s inner walls with earth directly opposite such points.\n\nDig wells within the city, one every five paces, adjacent to the city walls. On high ground, dig to a depth of a *zhang* and five *chi*; on lower ground, dig until reaching the water table at three *chi*. Order potters to craft jars holding forty *dou* or more, securing them with thin leather straps. Place these jars in the wells, and have keen-eared listeners lie prone to detect the direction of tunneling. Then dig inward to intercept the tunnels.\n\nOrder potters to craft \"moon-bright\" tubes, two *chi* and five *cun* long with a six-*wei* circumference, split lengthwise. Join the halves and place them within the tunnels, one facing upward, the other downward. Plaster the outer supports thoroughly, ensuring no gaps. Do not burn the supports; instead, plaster them well, including the joints, to prevent leaks. Repeat this on both sides, advancing together with the inner tunnel.\n\nAt the tunnel’s base, place a *kang* or *ji* (basket), but do not fill it. The *ji-kang* shall be five *bao* long, with both sides arranged symmetrically. At the tunnel’s inner mouth, construct a *ao* (kiln-like chamber) large enough to hold seven or eight bundles of mugwort. Repeat this for all tunnels, using four *mi* (bellows) per chamber.\n\nWhen the tunnel is about to be breached, strike it with a *jie-gao* (battering ram). Beat drums and discard the *zun* (vessels) to create noise. Ensure those skilled in such matters do not leave the tunnel’s mouth.\n\nJoin planks to match the tunnel’s height and width, allowing tunnelers to advance with the planks. Chisel the planks to accommodate spears, spacing them closely enough to defend the openings.\n\nIf the tunnels meet, block them with a *you* (shield). Use spears to defend the openings, preventing blockage. If an opening is blocked, reinforce the planks and relay them past the obstruction, then seal the next opening. Chisel the planks well, ensuring smoke can pass. When smoke flows freely, beat drums and discard the vessels to fill the tunnel with smoke.\n\nListen to the tunnel’s left and right, swiftly cutting off the enemy’s advance. If the enemy’s tunnel converges with yours, block it with firewood and plaster to prevent burning the planks. Thus, the enemy’s subterranean assault will fail.\n\nCut mugwort stalks to a *chi* in length and place them in the *ao* chamber. First, build a wall to face the tunnel, connecting it to the planks.\n\nDig wells adjacent to the city walls, one every three *zhang*, adjusting their placement based on the outer terrain’s width. Take care not to err. If the city’s interior is lower than its exterior, tunneling from within will be difficult.\n\nDig three or four wells on the city walls, placing newly cut wood inside. Listen from within to pinpoint the tunnel’s location, then dig to intercept it.\n\nWhen the tunnels are about to meet, prepare a *jie* cart. Use sturdy poles for the frame and equip it with sharp axes. Command three strong men to operate the *jie* cart, ramming the tunnel. Pour over ten *shi* of filth into the breach.",

Both pillars should be of the same material, supporting the crossbeam that bears the earth. The pillars should be two and a half spans in circumference, firmly bearing the earth’s weight. Ensure no pillar intersects another.\n\nDig two kilns for the tunnels, constructing them as arched chambers. Assign one officer and one attendant to each, and be sure to provide water. Seal the tunnel entrances with carts positioned on both sides, covering them with a roof. Apply mud to the top, adjusting the height and width according to the tunnel’s dimensions.

The tools should be seven *chi* long.\n\nInside the tunnel, fashion sharp iron rings and chains, with two tunnels in operation. Dig wells on the city walls, and once the tunnel is nearly connected, stand on the planks and chisel a narrow opening. Then shift the planks and chisel another. Equip the *jie* cart with two frames, planting stakes on either side and affixing hooks at both ends.\n\nAssign fifty laborers to the tunnels, with an equal number of men and women.

Where the city walls are too narrow for a moat, do not dig one. Place a deafening kiln every thirty paces on the walls, inserting five sections of *tan ju* reeds.

The frame should be over three *zhang* long, up to three *zhang* and five *chi*, with a horse’s cheekpiece two *chi* and eight *cun* long. Test the cart’s strength to determine its resistance, ensuring three-quarters of its force is directed upward.\n\nFor the *jie* cart, the frame should be three *chi* long, with two-thirds of its force upward and the horse’s cheekpiece centered. The cheekpiece should be two *chi* and eight *cun* long, and the frame twenty-four *chi* long, with the lower portion unused.

The lacquered *dai* is seven *cun* long, with a width of six *cun*, and its carving remains unfinished. The \"dog-runner\" is seven *cun* wide and one *chi* eight *cun* long, with fleas four *cun* long, and dog ears attached to it.\n\nMaster Mozi said: The method of defending a city requires tallying the timber within the city. What ten men can lift is called a *ten-qie*; what five men can lift, a *five-qie*. All weights are measured by the *qie* according to the number of people. For firewood and fuel, the strong have their *qie*, the weak have theirs—each proportionate to their strength. Whatever the *qie* of weight requires, the officers and people each bear their fitting share. If the city runs out of food, a great slaughter ensues.\n\nDig a great trench five paces from the city gate. On high ground, it should be three *zhang* deep; on low ground, it should reach the water table. Place traps within it, and above, construct a drawbridge with mechanical ingenuity. When filled with firewood and earth, it forms a passable path. Flanking it with trenches and ramparts prevents scaling or crossing. When the enemy approaches, the drawbridge is released, capturing them. If the enemy grows fearful and suspicious, they will scatter and disperse.\n\n**Defense Against High Assault (Fifty-Third)**\nQinzi bowed twice and asked: May I inquire—if the enemy piles earth to tower over our city, hauling firewood and soil upward to build a *yangqian*, advancing with shields and mantlets to press against the walls, while archers and crossbows ascend—what should be done?\n\nMaster Mozi replied: You ask about the *yangqian*? It is the tactic of the clumsy, sufficient only to exhaust their resources, not to harm the city. Build a defensive platform to overlook the *yangqian*, extending twenty *chi* to the left and right, with a walkway thirty *chi* long. Arm it with strong crossbows, deploy mechanical devices, and employ ingenious contraptions—thus the *yangqian*’s assault will fail.\n\n**Defense Against Overlooking with Linked Crossbows**\nUse a linked-crossbow cart, with a main shaft square and one *chi* on each side, its length matching the city wall’s thickness. It has two axles and three wheels, the wheels housed within a basket. The basket is weighted above and below. On either side stand two vertical posts, with protective posts flanking them. The protective posts are round inside, with an inner diameter of four *cun*. The crossbows are bound to the posts on both sides, their strings hooked to the main bowstring. The crossbow arms align with the basket front and back. The basket is eight *chi* high, and the crossbow axle is three *chi* five *cun* above the lower basket. The linked-crossbow mechanism is cast in bronze, weighing one *dan* and thirty *jin*. The bowstring puller is as long as a deer’s leg. The basket is three and a half *wei* in circumference, with hooks and spurs on both sides, each three *cun* square. The wheels are one *chi* two *cun* thick. The bronze spurs on the arms are one *chi* four *cun* wide, seven *cun* thick, and six *chi* long. The horizontal arms extend beyond the basket, with a span of one *chi* five *cun*, and spurs six *cun* long, three *cun* thick, matching the basket’s length. They have sights and can be adjusted up and down. The counterweight is one *dan*, made from timber five *cun* in circumference. The arrows are ten *chi* long, their tips bound with cord. They are shot like halberd darts, using a winch to draw them. The arrows rise three *chi* above the crossbow arms. Use as many crossbows as needed, with sixty arrows in circulation—no shortage of small arrows.\n\nTen men operate this cart.

      "translated_text": "**Preparations Against Scaling Ladders (Section Fifty-Six)**\n\nWhen Qin Guli served Master Mozi for three years, his hands and feet grew calloused, his face and eyes were blackened by smoke, and he toiled in service without daring to voice his desires. Master Mozi, pitying him, prepared wine, dried meat, and jujubes, and sat with him beneath the shade of a great tree to rest. There, he summoned Qin.\n\nQin bowed twice and sighed. Master Mozi asked, \"What is it you desire?\" Qin bowed twice more and said, \"I venture to ask about the Way of defense.\"\n\nMaster Mozi replied, \"Not now, not now. In ancient times, there was a state of Wei that neither cherished its people within nor formed alliances without. It slighted the many with the few, and the strong with the weak. Thus, its ruler perished, its state was lost, and it became a laughingstock under heaven. You, too, must be cautious, lest you bring ruin upon yourself.\"\n\nQin bowed again, kowtowing, and begged to inquire further about the Way of defense. He asked, \"If the enemy is numerous and fierce, their allies encircle our moat, their troops advance together, their cloud ladders are deployed, their assault preparations are complete, their warriors are many, and they vie to seize our city—what is to be done?\"\n\nMaster Mozi said, \"You ask about the cloud ladders? The cloud ladder is a cumbersome device, difficult to move and adjust. In defense, construct a mobile rampart with interlocking towers encircling the city’s interior. Determine its width based on the terrain’s breadth or narrowness, and lay straw within the encirclement, but do not make it too broad. The method for the mobile rampart is this: raise it twenty *chi* high, with battlements atop, ten *chi* wide. Extend projections twenty *chi* to the left and right, matching the rampart’s height and width.\n\n\"Bore sparrow holes and set up traps outside, with mechanisms, battering rams, axes, and hooks matching the width of the ramparts. Intermix these with chisels and swords. Assign ten strong men to wield the rams and five to hold the swords. Order observers to watch the enemy’s approach, signal with drums, and shoot from both sides. Shoot repeatedly, triggering mechanisms to entangle them. From the city walls, rain down arrows, stones, sand, and burning charcoal. Pour firewood, boiling water, and hot oil to aid the defense. Enforce rewards and punishments strictly, maintaining calm as the norm, and act swiftly to prevent the enemy from devising countermeasures. Thus, the assault of the cloud ladders will be defeated.\n\n\"Construct mobile battlements, each six *chi* high in ascending tiers, with swords facing outward, released by mechanisms. If the ram approaches, retract them; if not, deploy them. Bore sparrow holes every three *chi*, ensuring that the hooks for dropping objects are firmly set. Use carts to push and pull them.\n\n\"Outside the city, ten *chi* from the walls, dig a trench ten *chi* deep. Fell all trees, large and small, cutting them at the base, and use ten-*chi* lengths as stakes. Bury them deeply and mix them together, tamping firmly to prevent removal. Every twenty paces, create a killing zone with a barrier ten *chi* thick. Each killing zone has two gates, five *chi* wide. One gate should have a shallowly buried stake, left untamped for easy removal. Align the city’s defenses with the trench gates and set up straight barriers.\n\n\"Hang fire pots every four *chi*, and place cauldrons every five paces, with furnaces and charcoal at the gates. Lure the enemy in completely, then ignite the fire to burn the gates, followed by the hanging fire pots. Stand ready with halberds, filling the width of the ramparts. Between every two halberds, place one fire pot at the gate. All should stand holding drums and torches, ready to ignite them at once. If the enemy extinguishes the fire and renews the attack, lower the fire pots again. The enemy will suffer greatly and withdraw. Then order our troops to sally forth from the hidden gates on the left and right to strike their rear, commanding valiant warriors and generals to listen for the city drums to signal their advance and retreat.\n\n\"Routinely send out troops to harass them. At midnight, raise a clamor on all four sides of the city walls. The enemy will surely be thrown into chaos, and with this, their army will be broken and their generals slain. Have our forces wear white garments and use signals to recognize one another.

Once breached, the city may strike its people.\n\nThe *daxie* measures a foot in length, the flea five inches. Place two *daxie* in crosswise alignment, ensuring they lie level; if unlevel, they will not function. Both ends must be sharp.\n\nWhen tunneling troops or siege-engine troops advance, carefully assess the width of their assault formation and order the *ya* to dig counter-tunnels of equal breadth, ensuring they match the enemy’s approach. Bundle and stack timber, preparing sufficient firewood for barricades. Do not plant trees in front; instead, use logs seventeen feet long for the outer face. Arrange firewood barricades crosswise and lengthwise, then reinforce the outer face with thick plaster to prevent soil from leaking through. Ensure the counter-tunnel is wide and sturdy enough to support a city wall thirty-five feet high or more. Prop it with firewood, timber, and earth, securing it tightly.\n\nAdjust the length of the front face in advance, joining it with fleas to ensure it can bear the plaster and form a solid rampart. Plaster the exterior thoroughly to prevent burning or tearing.\n\nFor a great city, construct a postern gate fifteen feet high and four feet wide.

Bore a chamber fifteen feet deep and fill it with firewood, ready to be ignited when needed. Extend listening posts along the wall, constructing double-tiered towers. Beneath these, dig into the inner side of the outer wall to a depth of fifteen feet and a width of twelve. Equip the towers—or modern listening posts—with strong men to command the defense and skilled archers to loose arrows, supported by ample supplies of broad-headed arrows.\n\nPrepare defensive platforms along the parapets, six feet high and four feet wide, all fitted with shields, crossbows, and spear racks. Install rotating crossbows: the machine six feet long, the stock one foot. Join two poles to form a roller two feet long, with a central groove for the arm, which extends to the crossbar. Place one every twenty paces, assigning skilled archers to assist, with no man leaving his post.\n\nErect a tower every hundred paces along the wall, each supported by four pillars and connected by walkways. The lower section ten feet high, the upper nine feet, with a width and depth of sixteen feet each—all reinforced for stability. Construct a bulwark every thirty paces: nine feet high, ten feet wide, eight feet tall, with a three-foot-wide bore and a two-foot depth, all secured.\n\nOn the wall, prepare fire drills, their length adjusted to the city’s height, with tinder placed at the ready. Every nine feet, station a crossbow, a halberd, a mallet, an axe, and mugwort, along with piles of three stones and surplus arrows.\n\nThe *qu* measures sixteen feet long, its shaft ten feet; the arm six feet, with a three-foot stock. Plant the *qu* no more than three feet from the parapet. The assault bridge is eight feet long and seven feet wide, its wooden frame five feet wide, with a straight central plank and ropes at both ends. When under attack, assign one man to raise and lower it, never leaving his post.

      "translated_text": "Basins and ladles, two sets each. Prepare dry rations for the soldiers, two *dou* per person, to guard against overcast and rain, storing them in dry places. Order the defenders to deliver meals within the city and to the patrols outside. Prepare tools and equipment, crushing iron sand and gravel into fragments for *huai* ladles. Instruct potters to make thin jars, each holding one *dou* or more up to two *dou*, to be used immediately, bound in threes with tight bindings. Reinforce the parapets on the city wall. The assault bridges stand twelve feet high, with notches at one-foot intervals. Construct wicket gates, each with two leaves, so they may be closed independently.\n\nWhen defending against attacks on the moat, contend with fire, sounding the drums and drums of provisions. Inside and outside the ramparts, pile firewood as barriers. Set up *lingding* poles every three *zhang*, with fire hooks attached. Station one man every ten paces within the firewood, armed with crossbows at half draw, encircled by *gouxi* shields. Place a wall every seven paces.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches our city, it is an urgent and extraordinary situation. Be vigilant against tunnel attacks. If a tunnel is suspected to correspond with the enemy, dig urgently. If the tunnel is not yet breached, take care not to pursue. For countering tunnel attacks, dig a counter-tunnel every twenty paces, ten feet high and ten feet deep, following the previous method. Three feet below the surface, dig a ten-pace tunnel branching left and right, each ten feet high and wide. Place two jars level with the city wall, covering them with planks and listening through a well-like shaft. Every five paces, use barriers of pine or cypress as tunnel doors. Each door has two crossbars, both as long as the door, with rings attached. Pile stones outside the tunnel entrance to a height of seven feet, adding firewood on top. Do not construct steps or use stones; instead, use a suspended ladder for entry and exit.\n\nPrepare bellows and leather bags, the latter made of oxhide. The bellows have two jars, connected by a bridge to a drum with a hundred and ten beats. Each bag holds forty *shi* of black earth. Burn charcoal within, filling the bellows and sealing them to prevent qi from escaping. When the enemy approaches within five hundred paces of our tunnel, whether their tunnel is higher or lower, if it does not yet reach ours, use a large chisel to seek a connection. If our tunnel meets the enemy’s, encircle them without pursuit, and prepare to retreat northward, awaiting the bellows’ fire to ignite. Then withdraw and seal the tunnel to kill them.\n\nConstruct escape hatches with locks and keys, allowing free movement within. Place a dog in each tunnel; if it barks, someone is present. Assign fifty men. Inside the tunnel, create an opening for relaying messages, receiving six signals. Use oxhide to lower a measuring rope, which can be pulled or thrown. Afterward, seven men guard the retreat. In the tunnel’s center, store a large hemp rope and all tunnel tools. To obstruct tunnels, gather wood from the outer moat’s edge, scattering it to block the tunnel and probe its boundaries. Near the tunnel, prepare iron axes. Provide sufficient four-foot-long metal rods and *fulin* poles. If the enemy tunnels, counter with our own tunnel. Prepare iron hooks four feet long, in sufficient quantity, to probe and hook the enemy’s tunnel. Equip with *ju* spears, short halberds, short crossbows, and barbed arrows, all in sufficient supply, to fight within the tunnel. Use a metal sword for defense, five feet long, with a socket and wooden shaft; the shaft has a crossbar to block the enemy’s tunnel.\n\nWarn those holding jars: if the enemy’s jar weighs thirty *jin* or more, place it in the tunnel, one every *zhang*, to listen for sounds within. Dig tunnels eight feet high and wide, carefully constructing and positioning them. Prepare complete oxhide bellows, including skins and methods, to defend two tunnels. Cover the tunnel with chaff and mugwort, testing smoke penetration. Forge metal axes for chopping, with shafts three feet long, to defend four tunnels. Construct barriers to defend forty tunnels, connecting them in groups of four. Provide sufficient axes, hatchets, saws, chisels, and hoes. Forge iron fetters to defend four tunnels. Build a central shield ten and a half *zhang* high and four feet wide. Construct eight horizontal shields for the tunnel, with ropes and hemp in sufficient supply, to illuminate the tunnel. Prepare vinegar to counter smoke, protecting the eyes. Distribute vinegar in the tunnel, placing at least four *dou* in a *zhang*-sized basin. When smoked, apply vinegar to the eyes and face.\n\n**Defense Against Scaling Ladders (Chapter 63)**\nQinzi bowed twice and said: \"I venture to ask: if the enemy is strong or weak, and they scale the city walls, cutting off reinforcements first and attacking later, using the city wall as a base and digging chambers below, halting in front while archers shoot rapidly from behind—what should be done?\"\n\nMaster Mozi replied: \"Are you asking about defending against scaling ladders? Scaling ladders are the enemy’s reckless tactic. Defenders should shoot at them from the parapets, using crossbow mechanisms to strike them, pulling them down, pressing them closely, burning *da* mats to cover them, and raining down sand and stones. Thus, the scaling ladder attack will fail.\"\n\nTo defend against scaling ladders, construct suspended shields: wooden boards two *cun* thick, three feet front and back, five feet wide, and five feet high, mounted on a wheeled base with wheels sixteen *cun* in diameter. Have one person operate a twenty-four-foot-long square pole with blades at both ends, positioned within the suspended shield. Use iron rings to fasten two shields to the upper crossbar, creating a mechanism. Assign four strong men to raise and lower it without difficulty.\n\nDeploy suspended shields at intervals of twenty paces, and six paces where the attack is concentrated. Prepare *jing* shields, each two *zhang* in length and width, with a wooden upper crossbar. Bind them with wide hemp ropes, soaking the ropes in mud. Forge iron hooks to suspend them from both ends. If the enemy scales the city with ladders, burn *da* mats to cover them, linking them together, and rescue them with large nets. Use two-wheeled carts with wide axles to block them, wearing down their ends. Bind the wheels and coat them with mud.",

Those handling fire must use cloth, hemp sacks, and leather basins, one every ten paces. The handle is eight feet long, the container holding two *sheng* or more, up to thirty. Use worn or new cloth six feet long, with a central grip and a ten-foot handle, one every ten paces, secured with thick ropes.\n\nStation a water vessel every ten paces, each holding three *dan* or more, with varying sizes mixed together.\"",

      "translated_text": "Within the chamber, use elm or hazel wood, with brambles along the sides, naming it the \"fire barrier\" or alternatively the \"boiling broth defense,\" to counter enemy assault teams. When the enemy mounts the assault, burn the boiling broth defense, sever its cords to bring it down, and have valiant warriors follow to strike, ensuring these warriors advance first while the city walls are promptly repaired where breached.\n\nBelow the city wall, prepare \"substitute stakes\" of catalpa wood, five *chi* in length, with half their girth above ground. Carve their ends into five rows, each row spaced three *chi* apart, with three *chi* between each stake, and plant them with large ears. Construct \"linked receptacles,\" five *chi* in length and ten *chi* in width. The \"rods\" are two *chi* long and six *cun* in diameter, with cords two *chi* in length.

Sixty-Sixth Missing Section.\n\n**Welcoming the Enemy with Sacrifices, Sixty-Eighth**\nWhen the enemy comes from the east, meet them at the eastern altar. The altar is eight *chi* high, with eight *mi* of hall density. Eight elders of eighty years preside over the sacrifice. Eight green banners and eight green spirit tablets, each eight *chi* long, are used. Eight crossbows shoot eight times and then cease. The general’s attire must be green, and the sacrificial animal is a chicken.\n\nWhen the enemy comes from the south, meet them at the southern altar. The altar is seven *chi* high, with seven *mi* of hall density. Seven elders of seventy years preside over the sacrifice. Seven red banners and seven red spirit tablets, each seven *chi* long, are used. Seven crossbows shoot seven times and then cease. The general’s attire must be red, and the sacrificial animal is a dog.\n\nWhen the enemy comes from the west, meet them at the western altar. The altar is nine *chi* high, with nine *mi* of hall density. Nine elders of ninety years preside over the sacrifice. Nine white banners and nine plain spirit tablets, each nine *chi* long, are used. Nine crossbows shoot nine times and then cease. The general’s attire must be white, and the sacrificial animal is a sheep.\n\nWhen the enemy comes from the north, meet them at the northern altar. The altar is six *chi* high, with six *mi* of hall density. Six elders of sixty years preside over the sacrifice. Six black banners and six black spirit tablets, each six *chi* long, are used. Six crossbows shoot six times and then cease. The general’s attire must be black, and the sacrificial animal is a *xi*.\n\nFor all major sacrifices at external residences, spirit mediums may offer prayers, and sacrificial animals are provided. In observing *qi*, there is the *qi* of great generals, the *qi* of lesser generals, advancing *qi*, retreating *qi*, and defeated *qi*. Those who can discern these clearly may foretell victory or defeat, fortune or misfortune.\n\nSummon shamans, physicians, and diviners to their posts. Prepare medicines in full, house them in the palace, and provide them with proper quarters. Shamans must reside near the public altars and revere the spirits. Shamans and diviners are to request the commander’s presence only to observe *qi* and make inquiries. If they spread rumors to alarm officials and the people, investigate discreetly, pass judgment, and impose penalties without pardon. The quarters for observing *qi* should be near the commander’s office.\n\nSelect worthy grand officers, those with specialized skills, and artisans, and treat them with respect. Employ butchers and cooks in the kitchens to serve, and treat them with respect.\n\n**General Principles of Defending a City**\nThe county magistrate assumes command, dispatches guards, patrols the moats and embankments, constructs bridges and roads, and repairs the city walls. All officials contribute resources, and all artisans attend to their duties. The marshal inspects the city’s defenses and organizes the troops.\n\nSet up city gates with three persons in charge of the right gate, two in charge of the left gate, and four in charge of closing the gates, while a hundred armored soldiers stand guard. On the city walls, every step has one armored soldier and one halberdier, each assisted by three attendants. Every five steps, there is a squad leader; every ten steps, a platoon leader; every hundred steps, a company commander. Flanking them are senior officers, and in the center is the commanding general, each with their respective officers and subordinates.\n\nAt the city’s stairways, officials are stationed to guard them. In the central area, urgent matters are reported swiftly. All soldiers have their duties.\n\nOutside the city, within the range of arrows, demolish walls to prevent the enemy from using them as cover. Within thirty *li*, bring firewood, kindling, and water inside. Dogs, donkeys, pigs, and geese are to be eaten, and their bones collected to make fermented broth for the sick.\n\nWithin the city, firewood, kindling, and thatched huts—anything within arrow range—are to be removed to prevent their use as cover. Issue orders at dusk to tether dogs and horses and to weave ropes. During the quiet of night, listen for drumbeats to assess the situation, which serves to counter the enemy’s *qi* and strengthen the people’s resolve. Thus, regular assessments prevent the people from growing weary.\n\nThe invocators and scribes then make announcements to the altars of the four directions, mountains, rivers, and the soil and grain spirits. They first address military matters before withdrawing. The lord, dressed in plain clothes, takes an oath in the grand ancestral temple, saying: “These people act without the Dao, neglecting righteousness and propriety. They claim to be kings, declaring: ‘I will surely destroy your altars and annihilate your people.’ My two or three ministers, rise in the night and exert yourselves! Be diligent on my behalf, unite in purpose and strength, and defend to the death.” After the oath, the lord retires to eat. He lodges to the right of the grand ancestral temple, while the invocators and scribes lodge at the soil altar.\n\nAll officials prepare their attendants. Drums are beaten at the gatehouse, with the right side displaying the military banner and the left side displaying the standard at the corner of the training ground. Three arrows are shot to announce victory. With all five types of weapons prepared, they descend, exit the gate, and ascend to survey the outskirts. Drums are then sounded, and shortly after, the marshal shoots from the right side of the gate. Reed arrows are shot first, followed by three arrows of thatch, then bows and crossbows. From the left side of the gate, the troops first hurl javelins, followed by stones. The invocators, scribes, and ancestral officers report to the soil altar and cover the offerings with rice.\n\n**Standards and Flags, Sixty-Ninth**\nIn the art of defending a city, wood is represented by green flags, fire by red flags, firewood by yellow flags, stone by white flags, water by black flags, food by mushroom-shaped flags, dead soldiers by *cangying* flags, elite soldiers by *yu* flags, large troops by double-hare flags, five-*chi* boys by child flags, women by ladder-end flags, crossbows by dog flags, halberds by foot-soldier flags, swords and shields by feather flags, chariots by ridge flags, and cavalry by crow flags. For any flags not listed in the records, name them according to their shape.\n\nWhen flags are raised on the city walls, the officials in charge of supplies deliver resources until they are sufficient, then lower the flags.\n\n**General Principles of Defending a City (continued)**\nStones are to be stockpiled, firewood stockpiled, reeds and thatch stockpiled, *ju* and reeds stockpiled, wood stockpiled, charcoal stockpiled, sand stockpiled, pine and cypress stockpiled, *peng* and mugwort stockpiled, hemp and resin stockpiled, metal and iron stockpiled, and grain and rice stockpiled. Wells and pulleys have designated locations, hostages have residences, the five types of weapons each have their flags, and tokens each have their distinctions. Laws and decrees each have their constancy.",

      "translated_text": "**Section Seventy: Orders and Commands**\n\nWeights and measures each have their requests; those responsible for overseeing roads have their regulations.\n\nWatchtower officers each have their banners: poles twenty-five feet long, silk fifteen feet long, and half a bolt in width for the largest. When the enemy relays an attack at the outer edge of the moat, the city’s defenders at the corresponding sector strike the drum three times and raise one banner. When they reach the middle of the water, strike four times and raise two banners. When they reach the palisade, strike five times and raise three banners. When they reach the inner rampart, strike six times and raise four banners. When they reach the parapet, strike seven times and raise five banners. When they scale the main wall, strike eight times and raise six banners. If they climb more than halfway up the wall, the drumming continues without pause. At night, use fire signals in the same manner. When the enemy retreats, lower the banners in the same sequence as they were raised, but without drumming.\n\nThe city’s defensive mound is fifty feet long. On each of the four sides and four gates, the commanding officers are forty feet long, followed by thirty feet, twenty-five feet, twenty feet, and fifteen feet, with no height less than forty-five feet. Officers and soldiers on the city wall place their insignia on their backs, while soldiers place theirs on their heads. Officers and soldiers below the wall place theirs at eyebrow level. If stationed elsewhere, place it at the left eyebrow; the central command places theirs on the chest. Each unit has one drum, while the central command has three. Every drum is struck thirty times in three sets. All officers with drums must respond in strict order—those who fail to respond when they should, or respond when they should not, will be executed by the commander.\n\nRoads are thirty paces wide, with two stairways on either side at the base of the city wall. Wells are equipped with iron crossbows. Beyond the roads, construct screens thirty paces apart, circular and ten feet high. For civilian districts, walls must be at least twelve feet high. Those guarding the perimeter roads have gates at their centers, each guarded by two men. Without a verified token, none may pass—those who disobey are executed.\n\nAll officers, soldiers, and civilians—men and women—wear distinct badges and clothing to distinguish gender. For those guarding the sacrificial altars: after three advances and retreats, the commander summons them, rewards them with food, and presents a great banner. Record the names of those from each hundred-household village or other contributors, erecting a banner at their post so all may clearly know: \"This is the banner of so-and-so.\" The inner width of the sacrificial altar is twenty-five paces, the outer width ten paces, with length determined by terrain. Execute deserters. Train soldiers in formations—front, back, left, and right—and rotate those who are fatigued.\n\n**Section Seventy: Securing the State**\nThe Way of securing the state begins with assigning tasks according to the land. When land is used appropriately, success is achieved; when misused, labor is wasted without result. The same applies to people. If preparations are not made in advance, there is no way to secure the ruler. When officers, soldiers, and civilians are divided in purpose, the fault lies with their commanders.\n\nAll rewards, punishments, and governance must stem from meritorious service. Frequently send envoys to commend and reward those guarding border cities, passes, and frontier defenses, acknowledging the hardships of defending against barbarians. Assess whether the resources of their commanders are sufficient or lacking, whether the terrain is suitable for defense, and whether their equipment is well-stocked. In border counties and towns, if the trees are poor, use less timber; if fields are uncultivated and food scarce, avoid constructing large buildings with thatched roofs or excessive beams. If resources are abundant, the people may indulge in food.\n\nPrepare internal tallies, install plank walkways, and place equipment above them. Officers, soldiers, and attendants on the city wall all have quarters within the pathways, each assigned to their respective sectors. For every ten attendants, one is designated as the daily tally officer, responsible for verifying and guarding all gates. Gatekeepers and those enforcing prohibitions must not allow idlers to linger nearby—those who disobey are executed.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches, for a city wall a thousand yards long, the outer wall must be close to it, which benefits the defenders. If the wall is less than a thousand yards, do not engage. Observe the enemy’s position and numbers, and respond accordingly—this is the essence of defending a city. Matters not covered here should be addressed through personal vigilance and human effort.\n\nIn defending a city, inflicting casualties on the enemy with traps is paramount. Prolonging the siege to await reinforcements demonstrates mastery of defense. Those who cannot do this are unfit to defend a city.\n\nWhen the enemy is more than a hundred *li* from the city, the city commander must immediately summon all five officials and hundred-household leaders, taking the relatives of wealthy and prominent families as hostages and entrusting them with official tokens. Assign trustworthy men to guard them and act with utmost secrecy. Then, fortify the city.\n\nThe commander’s camp must have no fewer than three hundred men. For the four sides and four gates, select commanders who are meritorious officials or descendants of those who died in service, each leading a hundred soldiers. Gate commanders also guard other gates, and above each gate, construct high towers on both sides, stationing skilled archers there. Assign one person to the outer wall and one to the inner rampart, selecting those with dependents. Strike the drum every fifty paces.\n\nDivide the city’s wards into eight divisions, each with an officer. Each officer is accompanied by four men to patrol the streets and wards. For elders and minors in the wards who do not participate in defense or accounting, divide the ward into four sections, each with a leader to monitor movements. Those who wander at odd hours or behave suspiciously are to be investigated for treachery.\n\nOfficers with four or more soldiers under their command must receive a verified token from the commander. When the commander sends someone, the defender checks the token. If the token does not match or the signal is incorrect, platoon leaders and above must detain them and report to the commander. Those who fail to detain them or allow officers and soldiers to proceed will be executed.\n\nFor all crimes up to and including capital offenses, return the convicts to their parents, spouses, and siblings.\n\nFor men and women defending the city wall: every ten must have six crossbows and four other weapons. Able-bodied women, the elderly, and minors each carry one spear. If an emergency arises, the central command rapidly strikes the drum three times. All roads on the city wall, streets, and alleys within the city are to be cleared—those who move will be executed.",

      "translated_text": "When women join the main army, order the men to march on the left and the women on the right—no walking side by side. All must proceed to their assigned posts; those who disobey are executed. Those who abandon their posts are publicly denounced every three days as a precaution against treachery.\n\nThe *li* jars and all others must guard and stay overnight at the *li* gate. Officers patrol their sectors and, upon reaching the *li* gate, the jars open the gate to admit them. They patrol alongside the elders guarding the sector and inspect secluded alleys and uninhabited areas. If traitors conspire with external enemies, they are punished by *chelie*. If the jars, elders, or sector officers fail to report such conspiracies, they too are executed; if they expose the plot, they are exempted from punishment and rewarded with two *yi* of gold per person.\n\nWhen the commander dispatches inspectors to patrol the defenses, they make five circuits during long nights and three during short nights. Officers on all four sides also patrol their own sectors as the commander does; those who disobey are executed.\n\nSet up fire beacons in a grid pattern, with the fire chimneys rising four *chi* above the rooftops. Take care that no one dares cause a fire—those who do are executed. Those who intentionally start fires to create chaos are punished by *chelie*. If the five-person unit fails to report the arsonist, they are executed; if they capture the arsonist, they are exempted from punishment.\n\nFirefighters must not shout or clamor, nor may they abandon their posts to rush through blocked alleys to fight fires—those who do are executed. If jars, elders, or sector officers are guarding that alley, they may rescue the trapped, and the sector officer must immediately report to the commander. The commander dispatches trusted aides to lead the rescue. Sector officers who fail to report are executed.\n\nWomen sentenced to death or implicated in fire-related offenses are not punished unless they used the fire to incite disorder, in which case they are dealt with according to the law.\n\nStrict prohibitions during a siege: If the enemy suddenly arrives, officers and civilians must not dare to shout, gather in threes, walk side by side, exchange glances, sit and weep, gaze around, raise hands to signal, point, call out, pass by one another, follow closely, throw objects, strike one another, or press against others with their bodies or clothing. Nor may they argue or speak out of turn, or watch the enemy’s movements—those who do are executed. If the five-person unit fails to report the violation, they are executed; if they report it, they are exempted.\n\nIf a member of a five-person unit defects to the enemy, the unit is executed; if a platoon leader defects, the company officer is executed; if an officer defects, the company commander is executed. The parents, spouses, and siblings of defectors are all punished by *chelie*. Those who expose the plot beforehand are exempted.\n\nIf someone deliberately lures the enemy to a vulnerable position, they are executed. If the five-person unit fails to report it, they are executed; if they report it, they are exempted. If someone swiftly drives the enemy back from a vulnerable position, preventing them from advancing further, the two most effective units are rewarded with the highest honors.\n\nIf the siege is lifted and the city has a circumference of one *li* or more, the city commander is enfeoffed with thirty *li* of land as a *guanneihou*, the deputy commander is granted the rank of *shangqing*, and the adjutants and officers of equivalent rank are awarded the title of *wudafu*. Officers, officials, and valiant defenders who contributed to the victory—ten or more, including the five officers on the city wall—are all granted the rank of *gongcheng*. Men who defended the city are each awarded two ranks, women receive five thousand coins, and the elderly, minors, and those who previously assisted in the defense are each given one thousand coins. They are exempted from taxes for three years.\n\nThis is how officers and civilians are encouraged to defend resolutely and achieve victory in lifting the siege.\n\nOfficers and soldiers stationed at the main gate must not exceed two per unit. The bravest serve as vanguards, and the unit sits together, ensuring each knows their left, right, front, and back. Those who leave their posts without authorization are executed.\n\nThe gate captain inspects the guards three times during the day. At dusk, the drum is struck, the gate is closed, and one inspection is conducted. During the night, the commander sends someone to verify, and the names of those on duty are recorded. Meals are taken at the post; no one may eat outside.\n\nThe commander must carefully observe those who deliver messages, shield-bearers, attendants, and women serving at the front, noting their intentions, expressions, commands, and speech. When the commander eats or drinks, someone must taste the food first. If any of these actions are not requested, the offender is struck and questioned about the reason.\n\nIf the commander is displeased with messengers, shield-bearers, attendants, or women serving at the front, they may order their execution. If they resist or are bound improperly, or if the binding is delayed, they are executed. The commander must regularly warn them in advance.\n\nOfficers at the gates stand or sit morning and evening, arranged by age. Each morning and evening, they take their positions, with those of merit and ability first, followed by the rest in order. Every five days, each office reports one instance of frivolity, improper conduct, or bullying.\n\nWhen envoys from outside arrive, they must be accompanied by an escort. When they depart and return, or travel to a district, a trusted person must first prepare their lodging, then go out to greet them. Only after the gate guards verify their entry may they proceed to their lodging.\n\nSubordinates must constantly observe their superiors, following them as they move, but superiors do not follow subordinates. They must... follow. When guest soldiers guard the host’s city, or when the host provides guards for the guests, the host also guards the guest soldiers.\n\nIf garrison soldiers in the city belong to a town that has defected, take precautions and frequently inspect their posts. Do not allow those from the same town to guard the same location. Issue tallies to the officers at the stepped gates; if the tally matches, they are admitted and rewarded. If the tally does not match, they are detained, and the commander is informed. Those who ascend the city wall must wear the proper attire; any other violations are dealt with accordingly.\n\nThe night drum is kept at the main gate. At dusk, the commander orders cavalry or envoys bearing tallies to close the city, all holding *chan* weapons. At the first night drum (ten strikes), all gate and watchtower guards close their posts. Travelers are halted, and their reasons for moving are questioned; only then is their punishment carried out.\n\nAt dawn, the keeper of documents is shown, the drum is struck to allow movement, and the officers at each city gate request the keys. After the gates are opened, the keys are immediately returned. These orders do not apply when tallies or credentials are presented.\n\nWhen the enemy approaches, the watchtower drum is struck five times, followed by the perimeter drum and then the smaller drums. After five strikes of the small drum, the army halts. Commands must inspire awe, rewards must be substantial, and orders must be carried out. Once an order is issued, someone must follow up to assess its feasibility.",

He shall personally visit the homes of the dead and wounded to offer condolences and meet with the families of the fallen.\n\nWhen the siege is lifted, the commander shall dispatch envoys to commend the meritorious and tally the dead and wounded. He shall bestow ranks, emoluments, and honors upon them, elevating their status to inspire their enmity toward the enemy.\n\nSoldiers and officers on the city walls shall each safeguard their neighbors. Those who conspire to betray the city shall have their parents, wives, children, and siblings executed. Those who know of such plots but fail to capture or report them shall share the same punishment.\n\nHouseholds beneath the city walls shall mutually protect one another and report any misconduct on the walls.

Their names shall be recorded and confiscated.\n\nThose who move about the army without a tally shall be punished. When guests are stationed below the city, though their posts may frequently change, their provisions shall not; those who praise the enemy by understating their numbers, falsely claiming disorder as order, or misrepresenting clumsy attacks as skillful shall be punished.

Open all filled wells and fell all remaining trees. Bring every implement that could be used to attack the city inside the walls, ensuring each person records what they bring. When the task is complete, each shall retrieve their items according to their records. Seal the transaction with a contract, documenting the exact count. If any timber cannot be brought inside, burn it to prevent the enemy from using it.\n\nHave each person inscribe their name on a large placard and display it at their post.

Those who display cowardice, strike jars in disorder, create clamor and unrest, obstruct thoroughfares, abandon their posts, or disrupt the timing of operations shall be shot. Those who incite panic among the troops shall be executed. Those who fail to remonstrate with superiors or who spread ominous words shall be executed. No one shall dare bring musical instruments or worn-out armor into the army; violators shall be shot.

When executing someone in the marketplace, the executioner shall proceed with their eyes open.\n\nThe heralds shall wait outside the commander’s gate, forming two ranks seated on either side, taking turns to eat without interruption.

Those at the base of the tower shall receive the sentinels’ reports and relay them to the commander. Two attendants shall sit inside the side gate, with the gate kept ajar, taking turns to eat; one shall be a senior attendant. Patrol the streets around the commander’s palace, establishing guard posts along the roads, each with walls on both sides ten feet high, topped with battlements for observation. Place initial markers shaped like chicken feet, flanking the path to inspect provisions.\n\nCarefully examine and verify all written records, comparing them with the provisions. If discrepancies arise, investigate and rectify them. Outside the guard post walls, fortify the streets with towers overlooking the alleys, each tower equipped with a drum and a large bell. If an incident occurs, sound the drum, and officials shall arrive to address it. At night, use fire to indicate the drum’s location.\n\nConstruct latrines every fifty paces along the city walls, identical in design to those above. For those guilty of minor offenses deserving leniency, have them clean the latrines as punishment.\n\n---\n\n**Section Seventy-One: Miscellaneous Defenses**\n\nQinzi asked: When the enemy is numerous, bold, and eager to display their might to intimidate the defenders, advancing with firewood and earth to build *yangling* ramps, piling soil to tower over the people, pushing forward with shields, linking them to the city walls, and mounting siege engines and crossbows, what should be done?\n\nMozi replied: Are you asking about defending against *yangling* ramps? The *yangling* is a crude siege tactic, sufficient to exhaust troops but not to breach the city. Its effectiveness depends on distance: the farther the attack, the farther the harm; the closer to the city, the nearer the harm—but it will not reach the walls. Without respite, arrows and stones shall rain down, with archers moving swiftly to shoot from all sides. Use *lan* as rear supports, and maintain vigilance to fortify defenses.\n\nSharpen the resolve of our elite troops, ensuring they do not falter. Defenders shall hold their ground firmly, while attackers shall advance recklessly. Cultivate courage and high morale, and the people’s resolve shall multiply a hundredfold. With many holding their positions and few wavering, we shall not be endangered. If the troops do not rest, they cannot be withstood; once the enemy links their ramps to the city, counter them with the method for defending against cloud ladders.\n\nFor all defenses against smoke, battering rams, cloud ladders, and siege towers: if the city walls are insufficient, reinforce them with wooden beams. Place them a hundred paces to the left and right, and continuously hurl stones, sand, and charcoal upon the enemy like rain. Use firewood, flames, boiling water, and hot liquid to repel them.\n\nSelect and deploy elite troops, ensuring they do not falter. Clearly reward and punish, maintaining calm as the foundation, and act swiftly without allowing the commander to waver in resolve or the people’s morale to falter. With abundant rewards and strict discipline, the troops shall not grow weary. Battering rams, siege towers, and ladders shall all be countered with counter-rams.\n\nThe *qu* trench shall be fifteen feet long, with three feet buried underground, and arrows twelve feet long. The trench shall be sixteen feet wide, with a twelve-foot inner section and a four-foot overhang. Plant the *qu* without branches within five inches of the top. Place one ladder every ten feet along the *qu*. The number of *qu* answers: 258 per *li*, and 129 *qu* answers.\n\nOn all outer roads that can be fortified to hinder the enemy, construct three watchtowers where the threat is greatest, each with three corners, arranged like the Weaving Maid constellation to enable mutual support. On all mounds, forests, ravines, hills, ridges, outer gates, and intersections, establish checkpoints and minor posts to monitor the number of enemy movements and their hidden positions.\n\nTo protect the people, first survey all official residences, civilian homes, offices, and buildings within the city, large and small, and assign them to defenders. Allow those who wish to defend alongside brothers or acquaintances to do so. Bring grain, livestock, property, and all resources that can aid the city’s defense from outer residences into the city. If the situation grows urgent, have them stored inside the gates.",
      "overlap_context": "ter gates. They shall erect markers there, positioning a small number of soldiers within the gates in such a way that their exact numbers remain unknown. Should an alarm arise and the enemy cross the battle-line markers, the city walls shall signal with a banner.

The people shall contribute grain, cloth, silk, gold, money, oxen, horses, and livestock, all to be valued at fair prices and recorded in contracts with their owners.\n\nAssign each person according to their strengths. When the affairs of the realm are properly ordered, duties shall be evenly distributed, and all shall find contentment in their tasks. When the realm’s affairs are well-prepared, the strong and weak shall be accounted for, and all matters shall be in readiness.\n\nWatchtowers for defense shall be built round, rising over three *zhang* in height, with platforms arranged for counterattacks. Construct scaling ladders with arms three *chi* long, extending three *chi* from the gates, secured with ropes. Dig double trenches and suspend planks as bridges.\n\nAt each watchtower, station one drum. For enemy signals, alarm signals, and disorder signals, transmit the fire beacons in sequence until reaching the ruler’s capital. In urgent matters, raise or lower the signals accordingly. When beacons are lit, beat the drums five times in succession, repeating the signal to indicate the enemy’s numbers and direction. Report daily and relay the sequence of signals without fail.\n\nUpon sighting the enemy, raise one beacon; upon their entry into the territory, raise two; if they besiege the outer walls, raise three beacons and one banner; if they gather at the outer city, raise four beacons and two banners; if they converge on the inner city, raise five beacons and five banners. At night, use fire signals in the same manner. Watchmen must act swiftly in emergencies.\n\nAt dusk, deploy scouts, assigning them minor posts. On hills and in forests, ensure all can be approached, and conduct inspections at dawn. If no approach is possible, each shall mark their position, and the city below shall respond accordingly.\n\nScouts shall place field markers, with lookouts stationed inside and outside the outer city, flags raised, and half the troops concealed within, their numbers unknown. At signs of alarm, raise the *kong* marker; upon sighting the enemy, raise the *mu* marker. On the city walls, signal with banners, and the outposts shall beat drums, align flags, and prepare for battle as directed. Farmers—men shall follow the outposts in battle readiness, while women shall swiftly return indoors. Upon enemy sighting, relay the report to the city’s commander.\n\nEach watch post shall have three guards, taking turns striking the marker while observing. Patrols of cavalry or officials shall inspect the surroundings to discern the enemy’s intentions. Upon sounding the drum, if the enemy is sighted, the drumming shall continue until the signal reaches the city.\n\nFor annual provisions:\n- One *sheng* per meal: thirty-six *shi* per year;\n- One-third *sheng* per meal: twenty-four *shi* per year;\n- One-fourth *sheng* per meal: eighteen *shi* per year;\n- One-fifth *sheng* per meal: fourteen *shi* and one *sheng* per year;\n- One-sixth *sheng* per meal: twelve *shi* per year.\n\nDaily rations per person:\n- One *sheng* per meal: five *sheng* per day;\n- One-third *sheng* per meal: three *sheng* per day;\n- One-fourth *sheng* per meal: two and a half *sheng* per day;\n- One-fifth *sheng* per meal: two *sheng* per day;\n- One-sixth *sheng* per meal: one and two-thirds *sheng* per day, with two meals daily.\n\nIn times of life-saving urgency:\n- Two *sheng* per day for twenty days;\n- Three *sheng* per day for thirty days;\n- Four *sheng* per day for forty days.\nThus, the people shall be spared from ninety days of hardship.\n\nWhen the enemy draws near, collect all miscellaneous metal vessels from the villages—bronze, iron, or anything useful for defense. First inventory all official residences, offices, and non-essential buildings, noting the size, length, and quantity of materials, prioritizing urgent needs. If the enemy presses close, dismantle houses and fell trees, ignoring any pleas or petitions. Bring firewood inside, stacking it not in overlapping rows but in orderly piles for easy retrieval. Any timber that cannot be brought inside shall be burned to deny its use to the enemy.\n\nStack wood by size, length, quality, and shape, with each type stored within the city’s four outer walls. Use the largest timbers as crossbars before piling the rest. For the city’s defense officers and above, their parents, siblings, wives, and children shall be held as hostages in the ruler’s residence to ensure steadfast defense.\n\nAppoint officials as follows:\n- *Du Sikong*: four for large cities, two for lookouts;\n- County lookouts: one per side;\n- *Ting Wei*, *Ci Sikong*, and *Yi Zheng*: one each.\n\nThose serving as attendants in the defense headquarters must be sufficiently wealthy, upright, and trustworthy, with their parents, siblings, wives, and children residing in the fortified palace. All officials must provide hostages to qualify for their duties.\n\nAt each main gate, station two guards, standing on either side to direct passersby outward. Place four halberds beside each gate, with the guards seated beneath them. Officials shall inspect them five times daily, recording the names of those who pass.\n\nWhere moats and waterways have strategic points or vulnerabilities, station suspicious individuals to be targeted by night patrols. In the water outside the walls, install bamboo spikes, each one *chi* wide and two *bu* long, submerged five *cun* below the water’s surface, varying in length. Arrange three rows along the outer edge, with the outermost row facing outward and the inner row facing inward.\n\nEvery thirty *bu*, construct an archery shelter, ten *chi* wide and twelve *chi* deep. In emergencies, dispatch the nearest reinforcements first, with others following in succession. For official passes, the issuer must clearly record the circumstances, ensuring the pass matches the stated purpose, and verify its return with a tally. When a pass is issued, the gatekeeper shall announce the time and the name of the bearer.\n\nForm units of one hundred *bu*. Connect and interlink guard posts, tunneling through walls where necessary. Build elevated walkways and construct embankments, reinforcing their tops. First, deliberate on virtuous plans and strategies before entering the fortified palace. Once inside, do not leave the city or abandon your post.\n\nAll defenders must thoroughly assess the city’s low walls and shallow moats, adjusting their defenses accordingly. Morning and evening, the troops shall sing to maintain discipline, using fewer men for easier defense. Select capable individuals and ensure every household stores three years’ worth of grain and vegetables to prepare for floods, droughts, or poor harvests.\n\nRegularly instruct border counties to cultivate *qiang*, *yun*, *wuhui*, and *zhuye*, planting them in outer residences where ditches and wells are genuine; if blocked, place them within.
