  "full_translation": "*The Scripture of the Supreme Master on Rescuing and Protecting Life from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*\n\nThus have I heard: At that time, the Supreme Master was in the land of Pulin, seated beneath a luxuriant tree, about to ascend to heaven. Thereupon, a disciple named Perfected One Tiaolin Fajing, along with all the great disciples who had attained the Dao, and all the devas and humans, gathered at the Master’s abode. Each took their proper seat and addressed the Supreme Master, saying: \"We, your disciples, beseech you to remain a while longer, to bestow your numinous transformation before ascending to heaven.\"\n\nThe Master then spoke to his disciples and followers: \"After my departure, for five hundred generations, all sentient beings will be plagued by malevolent ghosts, demonic hordes, and pernicious sorceries that seize their essence and qi, seeking to determine their lifespan and slay them without cause.\"\n\nPerfected One Tiaolin Fajing then said: \"It would be well to diligently propagate this scripture, so that in this degenerate age, sentient beings may be free from illness and suffering, spared from untimely death, and all demonic sorceries utterly eradicated. What I entrust to you is this scripture alone. If there are sentient beings without sons or daughters, yet who can recite even a single line or verse of this scripture, no malevolent ghosts or demons shall dare to approach them wantonly. Whether in the wilderness, the mountains, or forests, in times of peril or distress, in great fires or floods, one should constantly recite this scripture, and all shall be severed and dispelled. Why is this so? This scripture possesses great majestic and numinous power, emanating from the supreme rank of the Primordial Yang. It should be recited constantly; if one cannot recite it, one should simply keep it close to the bosom. Those who receive and uphold this scripture with a sincere heart shall attain the immortal Dao, and benevolent spirits shall guard and protect them. In past, future, and present lives, all disciples shall, by the Master’s numinous power, swiftly transcend the eight difficulties. If one wishes to journey afar, one should always carry it, traversing villages, great cities under royal transformation, and populous metropolises. When traveling among people, expound it with a single mind, and the merit shall be boundless. Even those who listen for but a moment shall have all their wishes fulfilled.\"\n\nThe disciples replied: \"We do not doubt the truth of this scripture. It issues from our Supreme Master, the Primordial Yang Immortal of the Great Mystery, unfolding its secret essentials—something most difficult to obtain. It is like a wondrous medicine that cures poisonous ailments, severs malignant toxins, and causes all venomous creatures, demonic sorceries, and malevolent forces seeking to harm to scatter in all directions upon sensing its fragrance. If you recite it with a single mind, no demonic gods or ghosts shall dare to glance back—such is the numinous power of this scripture. If one suffers from illness or pain, one should purify oneself by bathing the body, hands, feet, head, and face, and recite it with a single mind for others, and all ailments shall be cured.\"\n\nThe Supreme Master further addressed Perfected One Tiaolin Fajing: \"If there are malevolent ghosts, demonic soldiers, or pernicious sorceries that do not heed my words, I shall command these demonic officials to deliver them to the Ghost Laws of the Mysterious Capital, where they shall suffer punishments as numerous as the sands, and all their transgressions and calamities shall be utterly destroyed without remainder. I shall now invoke the names of seven Perfected Immortals, by which all may be delivered from demonic realms. Who are these seven Perfected Immortals? The first is Perfected One Guangwei Wei, the second is Perfected One Shifa, the third is Perfected One Suiye, the fourth is Perfected One Juzheng Lin, the fifth is Perfected One Juzheng Xuanlin, the sixth is Perfected One Jingde, and the seventh is Perfected One Shilongzhong. If one suffers from hardship, illness, or pain, one should recite the names of these seven Perfected Ones, and all pernicious sorceries shall be utterly destroyed, unable to approach.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus, the Master, moved by compassion, again addressed them: \"I now, out of pity for sentient beings, expound this scripture of the Supreme Primordial Yang. There are also the names of six Perfected Immortals: the first is Perfected One Luofa, the second is Perfected One Luoshang, the third is Perfected One Jiayang, the fourth is Perfected One Qindu, the fifth is Perfected One Touliu, and the sixth is Perfected One Xilin. These are the names of the six Perfected Immortals. If there are sentient beings, whether without sons or daughters, whether noble or base, who suffer from hardship or peril, all should recite the names of these six Perfected Immortals, and their afflictions shall be dispelled. All malignant qi and illnesses shall not dare to approach, and all shall be utterly extinguished without remainder.\"\n\nThe Supreme Master then addressed Perfected One Tiaolin Fajing, saying: \"Listen well with a single mind to what I shall declare. If there are countless disciples, all Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, all deva-kings and devas, after my ascent to heaven, if any receive and uphold the wondrous Dharma I entrust to you, we shall constantly guard and protect them day and night, ensuring their peace and security.\"\n\nPerfected One Tiaolin Fajing then addressed the Supreme Master: \"Your disciple, along with twenty-five Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao and deliver the world, shall, in this degenerate age, wherever there are those who recite this scripture, remain by their side day and night, guarding and protecting them. No demonic specters or malevolent spirits shall dare to approach, and such persons shall always be at peace externally and internally, cultivating wholesome Dharma.\"\n\nThe Master said to his disciples: \"Excellent, excellent! You are able to guard and protect what I have cultivated over hundreds of thousands of kalpas, and thus become Perfected Immortals of the supreme rank of the Primordial Yang, my foremost disciples.\"\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, four Mountain Spirit-Kings, each leading their retinues and followers, approached, knelt in reverence, and with hands clasped, addressed the Supreme Master: \"After your ascent to heaven, we and our retinues shall traverse the borders of the kingdom in peace. Wherever there are those who recite, copy, receive, and uphold this scripture, our retinues shall constantly follow and guard them day and night, ensuring they encounter no evil.\"\n\nWhen such a person wishes to traverse the wilderness, we shall constantly follow and escort them, diligently guarding and protecting, never leaving their side, preventing evil ghosts from rashly approaching or encroaching. They shall always be sated, never suffering hunger or thirst. Whatever they seek, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall dispatch our generals, officers, and soldiers to fully provide for them, fulfilling their every wish without the slightest deficiency. Why is this? Because such a person propagates this scripture, cultivates wholesome Dharma, and venerates the treasures of immortality—those of the supreme rank of Primordial Yang—striking their immortal register to ensure it remains unbroken.\"\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, seven Mountain Spirit-Kings, each kneeling reverently with hands clasped before the Supreme Master, bowed their heads in single-minded devotion and addressed him: \"We, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, lead innumerable hosts, and above us are hundreds of thousands of heavenly beings who constantly traverse the evil world. If there are those in the human realm who recite, copy, receive, and uphold this *Primordial Yang Scripture for Repelling Demons*, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, together with the heavenly beings, shall escort them with our retinues to the heavens. Wherever such a person dwells and receives this sacred text, we shall constantly guard and protect them, never leaving their side day or night. We shall shield them so that no demon or evil ghost may seize their essence or vitality, no malevolent force may cut short their life, no harm may befall them, no ill fortune may be sought against them, and no curses or poisons may take effect. Our retinues shall always remain near their dwelling, even in the void. If they encounter a great fire, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall employ our power to rescue them by any means, ensuring the flames do not consume them. If they encounter a great flood, we shall swiftly divert the waters, and in the void, we shall come to their aid, preventing them from drowning—the waters shall halt, and they shall escape the peril. If they encounter bandits, we shall protect them on all sides, rendering the bandits’ weapons useless and filling their hearts with compassion. If they face imprisonment, shackles, or official bonds, suffering day and night, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall lead our retinues of generals, officers, and soldiers through the void, causing the officials’ hearts to fill with joy and release them, granting them full liberation. With our retinues of generals, officers, and soldiers wielding crossbows, we shall wholeheartedly protect them, preventing any disturbance from external causes. Throughout countless lands, peoples, villages, and cities in the kalpas to come, they shall constantly recite this scripture. Why? Because this scripture is the Dharma entrusted with utmost care by the immortals and sages—its words must be propagated, and its teachings must be disseminated. If there are Daoist practitioners who have not yet ascended to immortality and traverse forests or rest beneath cliffs, should mountain spirits, demonic women, echoing cliff spirits, or malevolent specters seek to harm them, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall ensure they feel no fear, their thoughts remaining steadfast as before.\"\n\nThe Supreme Master said: \"I now address you, Mountain Spirit-Kings and your retinues: Excellent, excellent! In past kalpas, spanning hundreds of thousands of myriads of years, you encountered the *Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Primordial Yang Scripture* and ranked among the eighth disciples of its divine transformations for delivering sentient beings. You have propagated this scripture and its teachings, reciting, copying, and writing it, employing skillful means to protect and prevent harm, constantly cultivating wholesome Dharma.\"\n\nThen, the Mountain Spirit-Kings and their retinues of generals, officers, and soldiers bowed to the Supreme Master, pledging single-minded devotion before taking their leave.\n\nThe Supreme Master addressed his disciple, the Perfected One of the Pure Dharma Grove: \"On the seventh day of the seventh month in the *ren-yin* year, I shall journey afar. After my departure, you must attend carefully to those I hold dear. I entrust you all with this burden: only my disciple of vast wisdom shall diligently propagate this Dharma, ensuring all sentient beings hear and know of it. O child of noble family, if you can receive this teaching, you shall be my heart’s disciple, and I shall entrust you with all the Dharma I have expounded. Out of compassion for all sentient beings, I enable their deliverance from myriad perils.\"\n\nHaving thus seated himself and entrusted this Dharma, he again addressed the assembly: \"This scripture is revered and mighty, possessing extraordinary spiritual power. Let all children of noble families, men and women alike, venerate it with incense, flowers, rare fruits, and lit lamps, and let them recite and transmit this scripture to relieve the illnesses and sufferings of others. They shall enjoy peace in this life, free from disease, and in the life to come, they shall be reborn in the constellation of Wen Chang, emerging from a lotus blossom with the body of an immortal, endowed with the five unhindered spiritual penetrations and boundless wisdom. Their lifespan shall extend to eighty-eight thousand years, and they shall regain their youth. Possessing the five penetrations and wisdom, they shall be as valiant and robust as the supreme immortals—all through the merit of the Primordial Yang Immortal Lords, whose virtues are beyond measure.\n\n\"O child of noble family, you must use fine paper, fine brushes, and fine ink to meticulously transcribe this legacy, propagating it throughout the realm. The words and passages of the Dharma I have expounded, as entrusted by my original master, the Primordial Yang Immortal Lord, are without error—you must not allow even a single stroke or dot to be forgotten. O child of noble family, out of compassion for sentient beings, I bequeath this scripture so that all beings with form may hear and know of it, their minds awakened and their thoughts constantly inclined toward goodness. They shall all proceed to the pure groves and cliffs, their lifespans extended and their spiritual powers unhindered.\"\n\nThen, the Perfected One of the Pure Dharma Grove, standing before his world-honored master, clasped his hands in single-minded devotion, baring his body and trembling with reverence, his hair standing on end. He listened intently to the Supreme Master’s words, not daring to forget a single phrase or character, and with tears in his eyes, he said: \"I shall receive and uphold the wondrous Dharma entrusted by the Master with utmost sincerity and propagate it widely. We disciples, having received the true teachings of the Heavenly Worthy, bow to our former master and pledge single-minded devotion.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"Whether you walk or rest, dwell in mountain forests, distant lands, cities, villages, towns, or imperial capitals, whether among officials or prisoners struck by calamity—wherever you are, contemplate this sutra, propagate it, teach others to recite and transcribe it. I shall manifest divine transformations, granting you all spiritual powers far surpassing those you now possess.\"\n\nHaving paid reverence to his honored master, he parted in sorrow. Master Lin of Primordial Yang was the second disciple of the Purple Yang Immortal. Originally born in the palace of the King of Impartiality and Departure from Filth, he was the youngest son of the Dragon King of Ling. His ancestral teachings came from Purple Yang as his master; what he transmitted and practiced was the Upper Section of Primordial Yang; his favored study was the Second Rank of Divine Immortals; his compiled works concerned the Wilds of the Banquet of Purity; and his given name synthesized the celestial patterns.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, he dwelt in the Great Manor of Flowering Forest Mountain, accompanied by two thousand great disciples, all perfected in practice, their faculties keen and unburdened by afflictions. Upon attaining the rank of immortal, he severed the seventy-two knots, his mind attained freedom, and he was named Master of the Pure Dharma Grove.\n\nWith his two thousand disciples, he remained in the Great Manor of Flowering Forest Mountain, cultivating refined contemplation for years until he attained the Second Rank of Immortals. Their resolve never wavered, their eloquence flourished, and their spiritual powers became unhindered. They could tread upon waves and ride the wind, traversing ten thousand leagues in an instant before returning to their former abode.\n\nAt that time, twenty thousand devas and immortals assembled, along with twenty-four thousand celestial maidens, all attaining freedom of mind. The Great Dragon Deva King, the Naga Deva King, the King of Forgetfulness, the Auspicious Dragon Deva King, and the King of Immortal Advancement, each leading their retinues of divine immortals and regalia, came to the abode of Master of the Pure Dharma Grove to inquire about the Upper Rank’s method of serene sitting.\n\nSurrounded by his fourfold assembly, the Master was honored, revered, and praised. For his disciples, he expounded the boundless virtues of the Upper Rank of Supreme Immortals. Then, seated beneath a tree, he entered profound contemplation, manifesting infinite wisdom and insight. Wishing to teach the kings the Second Rank of Primordial Yang, various celestial flowers descended to shade him.\n\nThe vast assembly, as if beholding all worlds, possessed the five spiritual powers. Gazing upward toward the Primordial Yang Divine Master, they awaited his instruction. That very day, he expounded the Upper Rank of Primordial Yang to them, saying: \"Listen well, and you shall receive the immortal record of Primordial Yang.\"\n\nThen, from his place in the grove, the Master radiated a great luminous spiritual power, ascending to the Pavilion of Primordial Yang Immortals, pervading all without exception, and descending even to the dark hells. The kings looked upward and beheld the immortal realm of Primordial Yang, where they saw all the devas and humans of that land—golden-walled cities, towering pavilions, palaces, immortal maidens, celestial pure abodes, and purple-clouded groves. They witnessed the devas reciting the scriptures of Primordial Yang, and the male and female disciples of that realm, both yin and yang immortal officials, receiving the inner契 of the divine. They saw those who had attained the Dao in myriad forms, those who practiced earnest cultivation, those of steadfast faith, and those of manifold spiritual powers.\n\nThe kings, having seen this, asked the Master: \"What realm is this, so magnificently adorned?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"This is Primordial Yang. That land abounds in wondrous jeweled palaces, with mountains, forests, rivers, seas, and wilds. Its people pursue immortality through various causes and conditions, seeking the immortal record according to their desires. Some see golden and silver cities and pools, with golden earth and silver-bordered paths. Everywhere are traveling kitchens, coral roads, ropes of pearls, and beds of mani gems. There are pools of giant clams, edged with agate, where all the devas and humans bathe. That land’s vajra-like treasures, servants, carriages, and jeweled adornments are borne aloft. Great patrons, with utmost sincerity, dedicate their merits to the realm of Primordial Yang Immortals, seeking to inscribe their names in the record and attain the foremost liberation across the Three Realms, praised by all immortals.\n\nThere are virtuous ones who offer four-horse chariots, jeweled carriages, balustrades, canopies, and adorned palaces. Among them, immortals give their own flesh, hands, feet, wives, and children as offerings, seeking the Upper Rank of Immortals. Some joyfully offer their heads, faces, and bodies, seeking immortal wisdom. There are great disciples who, seeing devas and enlightened kings approach the immortal realm to inquire about the supreme Dao, abandon their joyous lands, palaces, and servants, let down their hair, and sit in serene contemplation. Through profound concentration, they attain the five spiritual powers, don blue robes, and wholeheartedly comprehend the Upper Rank of Primordial Yang. Some disciples become immortals, dwelling in solitude, delighting in reciting scriptures.\n\nOne disciple, surnamed Jiao and named Lin, was courageous and diligent, entering deep mountains to contemplate the Upper Rank. Another, surnamed Zhou and named Qiao, day and night renounced desire, dwelling in seclusion, cultivating profound concentration to attain the five spiritual powers. Another, surnamed Mu and named Lin, stabilized his mind in contemplation, prostrating and praising the myriad ranks of immortals and their teachings. Another, surnamed Cha and named Lin, possessed deep wisdom and steadfast resolve, able to inquire into all dharmas, hear and uphold them all, and attain unhindered spiritual powers.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Zhang and named Ling, illuminated the Daoist teachings, was a Dharma King who pacified the realm, and broadly transformed countless beings through his cultivation, governance, and manifold teachings. The next, surnamed Li and named Guo, possessed perfect concentration and wisdom, expounding the Dharma to the assembly with infinite analogies, delighting in recounting ancient tales. He transformed princes and kings, was revered by devas and humans, and possessed the five spiritual powers. The next, surnamed Fu and named Lin, dwelt in serene stillness, revered by devas and humans, possessed the five spiritual powers, radiated light from the grove, and aided devas and humans, universally guiding them into the ranks of immortals. The next, surnamed Meng and named Gong, dwelt in the grove to cultivate his resolve, diligently studying the immortal arts. Possessing the five spiritual powers, he was the seventh in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\"\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Yin and named Jing, never slept, walking ceaselessly through the grove, diligently seeking the highest rank. Possessing wisdom and spiritual powers, his strength could move mountains.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Zhang and named Jiao, upheld perfect deportment and precepts, flawless throughout his life. Like a flawless pearl, he sought immortality and transcendence, his profound mind replete with wisdom, the seventeenth in the lineage of Primordial Yang, possessing the five spiritual powers.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Yu and named Lin, dwelt above desire and hatred, enduring arrogance, insults, beatings, and abuse in his quest for the five spiritual powers. He could even rebuke those of virtue.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Gong and named Yun, renounced all frivolity and praise, offering even his wife and children in pursuit of the highest rank. Possessing perfect wisdom, his spiritual powers were unimpeded.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Jiang and named Gui Lin, single-mindedly dispelled disorder, his thoughts fixed upon the Dao for ten thousand years! Traversing the borders of kingdoms, he sought the highest immortals, the ninth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Han and named Zhong, prepared countless delicacies, foods, and medicinal decoctions, widely healing illnesses, rescuing beings from life and death, and awakening the multitude. He was the thirteenth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Jia and named Lin, arrayed thousands of banners and canopies of sandalwood and precious jewels, adorning the external with myriad wonders, offering them to the Most High in pursuit of immortality. Such was this person, the fourteenth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Lü and named Zi, known as the Elder of Old Grove, dwelt in a pure garden where flowers and fruits flourished, and flowing springs and bathing pools abounded. Seeking to serve the highest immortals, he was confirmed as a Capital Elder and granted an unshakable immortal record, the eighteenth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Cheng and named Xing, widely practiced manifold deeds, liberating beings with joyful single-mindedness, never growing weary in his pursuit of immortality. He was the twentieth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Ma and named Zheng, was a walking embodiment of perfection, expounding the wondrous and subtle Dharma of quiescence, teaching and transforming countless beings. Observing the lineages of immortals, he saw no duality, like empty space, yet could discern all. Such was this person, the twenty-third in the Primordial Yang Scripture.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Dongguo and named Xing Lin, his mind like empty space, unattached to anything. With this wondrous wisdom, he traversed the borders of kingdoms, seeking a successor. Such was this person, the twenty-fourth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Liang and named Shi, sat in repose beneath the trees of the grove, deeply contemplating the wondrous verses of the Primordial Yang Scripture. Expounding them without limit, he adorned the borders of kingdoms with jeweled terraces of sublime height, five hundred *yojanas* in length and breadth, equal in measure. Seated there in leisure, he praised the Dharma for the assembly. Such was this person, the third in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Zhu and named Zhong, in every action ascended jeweled terraces and temples, each adorned with thousands of banners and canopies, pearl-embroidered veils, and jeweled bells. Seated upon a jade throne resounding with harmony, he expounded the Dharma for the assembly. Such was this person, the fourth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Hu and named Lin, possessed boundless wisdom, teaching dragon kings, humans, and non-humans alike, enabling all to attain immortality. He constantly offered fragrant flowers, music, and entertainment to the immortals. Such was this person, the twenty-seventh in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Kou and named Lin, from youth practiced the arts of immortality, ascending the Nine Peaks, surpassing the dust-like multitudes. He made offerings to all immortals. Such was this person, the twenty-ninth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Zhao and named Lin, from youth cultivated practice and learning, widely liberating the people. Serene and pure, he delighted in reciting the ranks of immortals, like the king of heavenly trees unfolding all. Such was this person, the thirtieth in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Yan and named Ping, sat in repose within the grove, emanating a pure light. I and all beings beheld this realm, witnessing manifold spiritual powers and rare wisdom. Such was this person, the thirty-first in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Zi and named Dan, widely traversed the world, serving his lord while contemplating immortality. Journeying far into the mountains and forests, he diligently sought the Most High. Possessing perfect concentration and wisdom, he constantly dwelt in the sunlight. Witnessing this, we found it unprecedented. Such was this person, the thirty-second in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\n\nThus concludes the *Scripture of the Highest Daoist Master on the Salvation and Protection of Body and Life*.",

All malignant qi and illnesses shall not dare to approach, and all shall be utterly extinguished without remainder.\"\n\nThe Supreme Master then addressed Perfected One Tiaolin Fajing, saying: \"Listen well with a single mind to what I shall declare. If there are countless disciples, all Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, all deva-kings and devas, after my ascent to heaven, if any receive and uphold the wondrous Dharma I entrust to you, we shall constantly guard and protect them day and night, ensuring their peace and security.\"\n\nPerfected One Tiaolin Fajing then addressed the Supreme Master: \"Your disciple, along with twenty-five Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao and deliver the world, shall, in this degenerate age, wherever there are those who recite this scripture, remain by their side day and night, guarding and protecting them. No demonic specters or malevolent spirits shall dare to approach, and such persons shall always be at peace externally and internally, cultivating wholesome Dharma.\"\n\nThe Master said to his disciples: \"Excellent, excellent! You are able to guard and protect what I have cultivated over hundreds of thousands of kalpas, and thus become Perfected Immortals of the supreme rank of the Primordial Yang, my foremost disciples.\"\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, four Mountain Spirit-Kings, each leading their retinues and followers, approached, knelt in reverence, and with hands clasped, addressed the Supreme Master: \"After your ascent to heaven, we and our retinues shall traverse the borders of the kingdom in peace. Wherever there are those who recite, copy, receive, and uphold this scripture, our retinues shall constantly follow and guard them day and night, ensuring they encounter no evil.\"",

      "translated_text": "When such a person wishes to traverse the wilderness, we shall constantly follow and escort them, diligently guarding and protecting, never leaving their side, preventing evil ghosts from rashly approaching or encroaching. They shall always be sated, never suffering hunger or thirst. Whatever they seek, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall dispatch our generals, officers, and soldiers to fully provide for them, fulfilling their every wish without the slightest deficiency. Why is this? Because such a person propagates this scripture, cultivates wholesome Dharma, and venerates the treasures of immortality—those of the supreme rank of Primordial Yang—striking their immortal register to ensure it remains unbroken.\"\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, seven Mountain Spirit-Kings, each kneeling reverently with hands clasped before the Supreme Master, bowed their heads in single-minded devotion and addressed him: \"We, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, lead innumerable hosts, and above us are hundreds of thousands of heavenly beings who constantly traverse the evil world. If there are those in the human realm who recite, copy, receive, and uphold this *Primordial Yang Scripture for Repelling Demons*, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, together with the heavenly beings, shall escort them with our retinues to the heavens. Wherever such a person dwells and receives this sacred text, we shall constantly guard and protect them, never leaving their side day or night. We shall shield them so that no demon or evil ghost may seize their essence or vitality, no malevolent force may cut short their life, no harm may befall them, no ill fortune may be sought against them, and no curses or poisons may take effect. Our retinues shall always remain near their dwelling, even in the void. If they encounter a great fire, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall employ our power to rescue them by any means, ensuring the flames do not consume them. If they encounter a great flood, we shall swiftly divert the waters, and in the void, we shall come to their aid, preventing them from drowning—the waters shall halt, and they shall escape the peril. If they encounter bandits, we shall protect them on all sides, rendering the bandits’ weapons useless and filling their hearts with compassion. If they face imprisonment, shackles, or official bonds, suffering day and night, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall lead our retinues of generals, officers, and soldiers through the void, causing the officials’ hearts to fill with joy and release them, granting them full liberation. With our retinues of generals, officers, and soldiers wielding crossbows, we shall wholeheartedly protect them, preventing any disturbance from external causes. Throughout countless lands, peoples, villages, and cities in the kalpas to come, they shall constantly recite this scripture. Why? Because this scripture is the Dharma entrusted with utmost care by the immortals and sages—its words must be propagated, and its teachings must be disseminated. If there are Daoist practitioners who have not yet ascended to immortality and traverse forests or rest beneath cliffs, should mountain spirits, demonic women, echoing cliff spirits, or malevolent specters seek to harm them, we, the Mountain Spirit-Kings, shall ensure they feel no fear, their thoughts remaining steadfast as before.\"\n\nThe Supreme Master said: \"I now address you, Mountain Spirit-Kings and your retinues: Excellent, excellent! In past kalpas, spanning hundreds of thousands of myriads of years, you encountered the *Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Primordial Yang Scripture* and ranked among the eighth disciples of its divine transformations for delivering sentient beings. You have propagated this scripture and its teachings, reciting, copying, and writing it, employing skillful means to protect and prevent harm, constantly cultivating wholesome Dharma.\"\n\nThen, the Mountain Spirit-Kings and their retinues of generals, officers, and soldiers bowed to the Supreme Master, pledging single-minded devotion before taking their leave.\n\nThe Supreme Master addressed his disciple, the Perfected One of the Pure Dharma Grove: \"On the seventh day of the seventh month in the *ren-yin* year, I shall journey afar. After my departure, you must attend carefully to those I hold dear. I entrust you all with this burden: only my disciple of vast wisdom shall diligently propagate this Dharma, ensuring all sentient beings hear and know of it. O child of noble family, if you can receive this teaching, you shall be my heart’s disciple, and I shall entrust you with all the Dharma I have expounded. Out of compassion for all sentient beings, I enable their deliverance from myriad perils.\"\n\nHaving thus seated himself and entrusted this Dharma, he again addressed the assembly: \"This scripture is revered and mighty, possessing extraordinary spiritual power. Let all children of noble families, men and women alike, venerate it with incense, flowers, rare fruits, and lit lamps, and let them recite and transmit this scripture to relieve the illnesses and sufferings of others. They shall enjoy peace in this life, free from disease, and in the life to come, they shall be reborn in the constellation of Wen Chang, emerging from a lotus blossom with the body of an immortal, endowed with the five unhindered spiritual penetrations and boundless wisdom. Their lifespan shall extend to eighty-eight thousand years, and they shall regain their youth. Possessing the five penetrations and wisdom, they shall be as valiant and robust as the supreme immortals—all through the merit of the Primordial Yang Immortal Lords, whose virtues are beyond measure.\n\n\"O child of noble family, you must use fine paper, fine brushes, and fine ink to meticulously transcribe this legacy, propagating it throughout the realm. The words and passages of the Dharma I have expounded, as entrusted by my original master, the Primordial Yang Immortal Lord, are without error—you must not allow even a single stroke or dot to be forgotten. O child of noble family, out of compassion for sentient beings, I bequeath this scripture so that all beings with form may hear and know of it, their minds awakened and their thoughts constantly inclined toward goodness. They shall all proceed to the pure groves and cliffs, their lifespans extended and their spiritual powers unhindered.\"\n\nThen, the Perfected One of the Pure Dharma Grove, standing before his world-honored master, clasped his hands in single-minded devotion, baring his body and trembling with reverence, his hair standing on end. He listened intently to the Supreme Master’s words, not daring to forget a single phrase or character, and with tears in his eyes, he said: \"I shall receive and uphold the wondrous Dharma entrusted by the Master with utmost sincerity and propagate it widely. We disciples, having received the true teachings of the Heavenly Worthy, bow to our former master and pledge single-minded devotion.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: \"Whether you walk or rest, dwell in mountain forests, distant lands, cities, villages, towns, or imperial capitals, whether among officials or prisoners struck by calamity—wherever you are, contemplate this sutra, propagate it, teach others to recite and transcribe it. I shall manifest divine transformations, granting you all spiritual powers far surpassing those you now possess.\"\n\nHaving paid reverence to his honored master, he parted in sorrow. Master Lin of Primordial Yang was the second disciple of the Purple Yang Immortal. Originally born in the palace of the King of Impartiality and Departure from Filth, he was the youngest son of the Dragon King of Ling. His ancestral teachings came from Purple Yang as his master; what he transmitted and practiced was the Upper Section of Primordial Yang; his favored study was the Second Rank of Divine Immortals; his compiled works concerned the Wilds of the Banquet of Purity; and his given name synthesized the celestial patterns.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, he dwelt in the Great Manor of Flowering Forest Mountain, accompanied by two thousand great disciples, all perfected in practice, their faculties keen and unburdened by afflictions. Upon attaining the rank of immortal, he severed the seventy-two knots, his mind attained freedom, and he was named Master of the Pure Dharma Grove.\n\nWith his two thousand disciples, he remained in the Great Manor of Flowering Forest Mountain, cultivating refined contemplation for years until he attained the Second Rank of Immortals. Their resolve never wavered, their eloquence flourished, and their spiritual powers became unhindered. They could tread upon waves and ride the wind, traversing ten thousand leagues in an instant before returning to their former abode.\n\nAt that time, twenty thousand devas and immortals assembled, along with twenty-four thousand celestial maidens, all attaining freedom of mind. The Great Dragon Deva King, the Naga Deva King, the King of Forgetfulness, the Auspicious Dragon Deva King, and the King of Immortal Advancement, each leading their retinues of divine immortals and regalia, came to the abode of Master of the Pure Dharma Grove to inquire about the Upper Rank’s method of serene sitting.\n\nSurrounded by his fourfold assembly, the Master was honored, revered, and praised. For his disciples, he expounded the boundless virtues of the Upper Rank of Supreme Immortals. Then, seated beneath a tree, he entered profound contemplation, manifesting infinite wisdom and insight. Wishing to teach the kings the Second Rank of Primordial Yang, various celestial flowers descended to shade him.\n\nThe vast assembly, as if beholding all worlds, possessed the five spiritual powers. Gazing upward toward the Primordial Yang Divine Master, they awaited his instruction. That very day, he expounded the Upper Rank of Primordial Yang to them, saying: \"Listen well, and you shall receive the immortal record of Primordial Yang.\"\n\nThen, from his place in the grove, the Master radiated a great luminous spiritual power, ascending to the Pavilion of Primordial Yang Immortals, pervading all without exception, and descending even to the dark hells. The kings looked upward and beheld the immortal realm of Primordial Yang, where they saw all the devas and humans of that land—golden-walled cities, towering pavilions, palaces, immortal maidens, celestial pure abodes, and purple-clouded groves. They witnessed the devas reciting the scriptures of Primordial Yang, and the male and female disciples of that realm, both yin and yang immortal officials, receiving the inner契 of the divine. They saw those who had attained the Dao in myriad forms, those who practiced earnest cultivation, those of steadfast faith, and those of manifold spiritual powers.\n\nThe kings, having seen this, asked the Master: \"What realm is this, so magnificently adorned?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"This is Primordial Yang. That land abounds in wondrous jeweled palaces, with mountains, forests, rivers, seas, and wilds. Its people pursue immortality through various causes and conditions, seeking the immortal record according to their desires. Some see golden and silver cities and pools, with golden earth and silver-bordered paths. Everywhere are traveling kitchens, coral roads, ropes of pearls, and beds of mani gems. There are pools of giant clams, edged with agate, where all the devas and humans bathe. That land’s vajra-like treasures, servants, carriages, and jeweled adornments are borne aloft. Great patrons, with utmost sincerity, dedicate their merits to the realm of Primordial Yang Immortals, seeking to inscribe their names in the record and attain the foremost liberation across the Three Realms, praised by all immortals.\n\nThere are virtuous ones who offer four-horse chariots, jeweled carriages, balustrades, canopies, and adorned palaces. Among them, immortals give their own flesh, hands, feet, wives, and children as offerings, seeking the Upper Rank of Immortals. Some joyfully offer their heads, faces, and bodies, seeking immortal wisdom. There are great disciples who, seeing devas and enlightened kings approach the immortal realm to inquire about the supreme Dao, abandon their joyous lands, palaces, and servants, let down their hair, and sit in serene contemplation. Through profound concentration, they attain the five spiritual powers, don blue robes, and wholeheartedly comprehend the Upper Rank of Primordial Yang. Some disciples become immortals, dwelling in solitude, delighting in reciting scriptures.\n\nOne disciple, surnamed Jiao and named Lin, was courageous and diligent, entering deep mountains to contemplate the Upper Rank. Another, surnamed Zhou and named Qiao, day and night renounced desire, dwelling in seclusion, cultivating profound concentration to attain the five spiritual powers. Another, surnamed Mu and named Lin, stabilized his mind in contemplation, prostrating and praising the myriad ranks of immortals and their teachings. Another, surnamed Cha and named Lin, possessed deep wisdom and steadfast resolve, able to inquire into all dharmas, hear and uphold them all, and attain unhindered spiritual powers.\n\nThe next disciple, surnamed Zhang and named Ling, illuminated the Daoist teachings, was a Dharma King who pacified the realm, and broadly transformed countless beings through his cultivation, governance, and manifold teachings. The next, surnamed Li and named Guo, possessed perfect concentration and wisdom, expounding the Dharma to the assembly with infinite analogies, delighting in recounting ancient tales. He transformed princes and kings, was revered by devas and humans, and possessed the five spiritual powers. The next, surnamed Fu and named Lin, dwelt in serene stillness, revered by devas and humans, possessed the five spiritual powers, radiated light from the grove, and aided devas and humans, universally guiding them into the ranks of immortals. The next, surnamed Meng and named Gong, dwelt in the grove to cultivate his resolve, diligently studying the immortal arts. Possessing the five spiritual powers, he was the seventh in the lineage of Primordial Yang.\"",
